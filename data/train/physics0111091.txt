    "over the past fifteen years , we have seen a revolution in laser intensities  @xcite .",
    "this revolution stemmed from the technique of chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) , combined with recent progress in short - pulse generation and superior - energy - storage materials like ti : sapphire , nd : glass , and yb : glass .",
    "the success of this technique was due to its general concept , which fits small , university - type , tabletop - size systems as well as large existing laser chains built for laser fusion in national laboratories like cea - limeil in france , lawrence livermore national lab .",
    "( llnl ) , los alamos national lab . , and naval research lab . in the u.s . ; rutherford in the uk , max born institute in germany , and the institute of laser engineering in osaka , japan .",
    "a record peak power of petawatt ( @xmath3w ) has been produced at llnl .",
    "cpa lasers have given access to a regime of intensities that was not accessible before , opening up a fundamentally new physical domain  @xcite .",
    "the large leap in intensities that we have experienced recently is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "this figure displays the focused intensities delivered over the years by tabletop systems . after a rapid increase in the 1960s with the invention of lasers , followed by the demonstration of @xmath4-switching and mode - locking , the power of lasers stagnated due to the inability to amplify ultrashort pulses without causing unwanted nonlinear effects in the optical components .",
    "this difficulty was removed with the introduction of the technique of chirped pulse amplification , which took the power of tabletop lasers from the gigawatt to the terawatt  a jump of three to four orders of magnitude .",
    "this technique was first used with conventional laser amplifiers and more recently extended to optical parametric chirped pulse amplifiers ( opcpa )  @xcite .",
    "a number of laboratories are presently equipped with cpa ultrashort - pulsed terawatt lasers such as laboratoire optique applique in france , university of lund in sweden , max - planck institute in garching , jena university , and the japan atomic energy research institute in kansai .",
    "the cpa - enabled short - pulse generation has advanced to the single - cycle regime  @xcite .",
    "the peak power in the 1990s reached 100  tw , demonstrated at jaeri kansai .",
    "more recently , deformable mirrors have been incorporated into cpa , making it possible with low f # parabola to focus the laser power on a @xmath5 m spot size  @xcite .",
    "present systems deliver focused intensities in the @xmath6w/@xmath1 range . in the near future",
    ", cpa systems will be able to produce intensities of the order of @xmath7w/@xmath1 . as indicated in fig .  1",
    ", we will see a leveling off of laser intensity for tabletop - size systems at @xmath2w/@xmath1 .",
    "this limit  @xcite is imposed , as we will explain later , by the saturation fluence - energy per unit area  of the amplifying medium and the damage threshold of the optical elements . in a well - conceived cpa system",
    "the saturation fluence is of the order but less than the damage threshold .",
    "once this limit is reached , we will have accomplished a leap in intensities of eight orders of magnitude and the only way to increase the focused intensity further will be by increasing the beam size , leaving the following questions to be answered : how could we go higher in intensity ? and how much higher ?    because the highest intensities will rely on the largest pump available , we explore if it could be technically feasible to build a large scale cpa ( opcpa ) pumped by a megajoule system of the type of the nif ( national ignition facility ) in the u.s . and the lmj ( laser megajoule ) in france .",
    "power in the zetta @xmath8 watt range could be produced , yielding a focused intensity of @xmath9w/@xmath1 .",
    "these intensities well beyond the current intensity accessible will open up a new physical regime .",
    "in a cpa system the maximum energy per pulse obtainable is limited ( 1 )  by the damage threshold @xmath10 of the stretched pulse  of the order of a few nanoseconds , and ( 2 )  by the saturation fluence @xmath11 of the amplifier . here",
    "@xmath12 is the planck constant , @xmath13 is the laser frequency , and @xmath14 the cross - section of the lasing transition at the lasing frequency @xmath13 , @xmath15 corresponds to the energy per unit area , necessary to decrease the population inversion by a factor of two , in a time shorter than the excited state lifetime , @xmath16 . for stretched pulses of the order of a nanosecond ,",
    "@xmath10 is of the order of @xmath17j/@xmath1 and @xmath18j/@xmath1 for ti : sapphire . for yb :",
    "glass , @xmath19j/@xmath1  significantly greater than the damage threshold of most optical components . in that",
    "regard , high - damage - threshold materials need to be developed in order to take full advantage of the excellent energy storage capability of this material . the minimum pulse duration @xmath20 is imposed by the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the transition bandwidth for a homogeneously broadened bandwidth . the maximum power per unit area is , therefore , given by @xmath23 while the maximum focusable intensity @xmath24 will be obtained when this power is focused on a spot size limited by the laser wavelength @xmath25 , leading to the expression @xmath26 this intensity limit is represented in fig .  1 .",
    "although a zettawatt system could be built using yb : glass , with the advantages of being relatively compact due to the high @xmath27 of this material and being diode pumpable , much development work needs to be accomplished to reach this intensity level with this material .",
    "the proposed systems described below have been stimulated by the construction , both in france and in the u.s , of lasers delivering a few megajoules of energy as well as the availability of large telescope technology ( 10 m diameter ) and deformable mirrors .",
    "let us recall that the nif and lmj systems will deliver 2  mj at 350  nm , i.e. , the third harmonic of 1060  nm in 3  ns .",
    "the energy at 530  nm , for a long pulse of 10 - 20  ns , could be as high as 5 mj .",
    "this energy could be used to pump a cpa - type system to produce of the order of 1 mj of energy in 10  fs on a spot size of @xmath28 m  @xcite .",
    "such a system will have a power of the order @xmath6w or 100 exawatts with an intensity of @xmath9w/@xmath1 . to produce these phenomenal characteristics",
    ", we have two alternatives .",
    "the first one would be to use this large pump energy to drive an opcpa system .",
    "this elegant technique  @xcite has been demonstrated to the joule level at 800  fs level a few years ago by i. ross _ et al . _ from rutherford  @xcite and is being implemented in the same laboratory to the 10  pw , 30  fs level .",
    "it has the advantage that it could use kdp as the nonlinear medium .",
    "kdp has been produced in large dimensions at a relatively low cost for the nif and lmj programs .",
    "the working fluence on the crystal will be 1  j/@xmath1 , leading to a beam diameter of around @xmath29m@xmath30 to accommodate the whole pump energy .",
    "this technique has the potential to produce a 10-fs pulse or shorter , but needs to be demonstrated at least at the joule level . the second approach , though more conservative",
    ", will be to drive a cpa ti : sapphire , a well - established technology .",
    "the amplifier will be composed of a large matrix of ti : sapphire rods .",
    "the size of the matrix will be dictated by the saturation fluence @xmath31j/@xmath1 , corresponding to a @xmath29 m diameter beam .",
    "the amplifier could be composed of 2500 , @xmath32 cm pieces , each @xmath33 cm in length .",
    "each piece will have to be segmented in order to avoid the transverse amplified spontaneous emission .",
    "ti : sapphire of @xmath32 cm has already been grown  @xcite . in both schemes",
    "the beams can be focused by a large parabola . the dielectric coating used for",
    "the parabola will have a damage threshold of 1  j/@xmath1 ( for short pulses )  @xcite , imposing a parabola size of @xmath29 m in diameter .",
    "this parabola will have the same diameter as the keck telescope .",
    "the phase front will be interferometrically controlled by an active matrix of deformable mirrors .",
    "the grating compressor could be made out of meter - size gratings assembled interferometrically in a matrix geometry .",
    "the size of the grating for a megajoule short - pulse system will be also of the order of @xmath29 m in diameter , dictated by a damage threshold of 1  j/@xmath1 ( such a damage threshold has just been reported  @xcite ) .",
    "each large grating will be composed of 100 of 1  m@xmath30-size gratings .",
    "note that although large , the number of optical components involved will be small , compared to a mj system calling for 4500 laser slabs , 800 large kdp frequency converter crystals , and 500 gratings of meter - size . an alternative method using a plasma",
    "has been suggested  @xcite , but will lead to the same output energy limited by the pump .",
    "in addition the beam must go through a plasma , which is highly undesirable .",
    "if a zettawatt laser , although feasible , could seem too grandiose at this time , an exawatt system on the other hand , which would produce @xmath29kj in @xmath29fs , i.e. , @xmath34w/@xmath1 , could be readily constructed .",
    "only one percent or @xmath35kj of the nif / lmj energy would be necessary .",
    "the beam size will be of the order of one meter in diameter .",
    "the amplifying method will be composed of a matrix of 25 ti : sapphire @xmath32@xmath1 crystals  @xcite and two gratings of meter - size .",
    "the segmented telescope will have a one - meter aperture .",
    "the wave front will be corrected by a large deformable mirror .    in the following",
    "we explore a few examples of applications of such intense lasers that may enable new ways to investigate fundamental physics .",
    "the major signpost of contemporary high - field science is the entry into the relativistic regime , which is characterized by the quivering momentum of electrons in the laser fields reaching the speed of light times the electron rest mass .",
    "this field is reached when the laser intensity is on the order of @xmath36w/@xmath1 for a typical optical frequency of the laser we mentioned above .",
    "when the laser field is much less than this , free electrons behave harmonically to the field s optical oscillations . although these oscillations of electrons are still important enough to couple with various collective motions of free electrons , there is small orbital nonlinearity associated with the quivering motion in this regime . for bound electrons in atoms or molecules the quivering motion in the laser fields is once again , by and large , a perturbation on their orbital motion .",
    "this perturbation is enough to cause various interesting phenomena in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "there is such a wealth of phenomena known in this regime that it is hard to list them briefly , but they include the multi - photon process of ionization , that of transitions , raman and brillouin scatterings , and various optical nonlinearities  @xcite arising from the material s response . in the relativistic regime with the intensity above @xmath36w/@xmath1 , in addition to the above phenomena , there emerge new classes of effects largely arising from the relativistic nonlinearities of electrons in the high field .",
    "the field intensity in this regime means that the electron momentum in the light is typically @xmath37 , which becomes of the order of and exceeds @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the laser angular frequency , @xmath40 the laser electric field , and @xmath41 the electron rest mass . when the electron momentum exceeds @xmath38 , the electronic orbit ceases to be harmonic and linear .",
    "it becomes a figure-8 motion , including higher - harmonic components .",
    "the photon pressure is exerted individually on an electron by the electron - photon collision through the thomson cross - section @xmath42 when the flux of laser at the intensity entering the relativistic regime is shone on an electron ( with lorentz factor @xmath43 ) , this causes a force on it @xmath44 when the laser intensity is @xmath45w/@xmath1 , the force acting on an electron is @xmath46erg / cm . or the acceleration acting on an electron ( originally ) at rest is @xmath47 where @xmath41 is the rest mass .",
    "[ in contrast to this , the schwinger acceleration is @xmath48 at which an electron gains energy by @xmath49 over the compton length @xmath50 , and the pair creation becomes prevalent . ] a large flux of photons bombarding an electron causes such high acceleration through collisions between photons and electrons ( compton collisions ) .",
    "such acceleration may be called the eddington acceleration , as eddington introduced the stellar luminosity at which the gravitational pull is balanced by this photon collisional acceleration ( the eddington luminosity ) .",
    "the eddington acceleration may be likened to the acceleration of water molecules near the surface of water in a lake when there is a breeze passing over the water surface . the collisional viscosity created by collisions between water molecules and wind molecules",
    "gives rise to a water flow .",
    "however , we also observe that when the breeze gets stronger or becomes a gale , the water surface is no longer smooth and acquires ripples or waves .",
    "such ripples facilitate an increase in the effective viscosity of water for the wind , so that the wind momentum is anomalously effectively transported to water molecules with a much faster rate through the kelvin- helmholtz instability at the interface of the two fluids .",
    "what happens in the case of strong photon flux (  wind \" ) in a plasma ?",
    "just like the strong wind on the water surface , the strong photon flux is capable of creating plasma waves , which in turn causes enhanced viscosity and thus anomalous momentum transport from photons to electrons of the plasma .",
    "this latter process is through a collective interaction .",
    "the plasma wakefield excitation  @xcite is typical of this , in which plasma waves generated in this process are accentuated , and new processes of collective interaction emerge . in this ultraintense regime , electrons may be accelerated not only through the electrostatic field that is set up by the ponderomotive force of the laser , but also directly by the ponderomotive force itself to very high energies .",
    "if we apply this laser at the resonance absorption at high densities near the compressed laser fusion target , on the other hand , much of the laser energy may be converted into relatively low - energy copious electrons , which could constitute a new alternative to the fast ignition fusion .",
    "the acceleration of heavier particles ( protons and other nuclei ) to relativistic energies will become possible , too . either by direct baryon acceleration by this , or other process , ( it will take a variety of experimental realizations such as a target irradiation , cluster irradiation , converging imploding shells , etc ) , we will access the nuclear regime of matter reminiscent of the early epoch of the big bang ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the production of extremely high energy or copious gamma rays will happened .",
    "the extreme high photon pressure ( which already exceeds gbar in the presently available intense lasers ) may be finally directly utilized to directly compress matter in this ultrarelativistic regime , because baryons , too , become relativistic .",
    "if so , unprecedented densities of matter may be created .",
    "the combination of extreme intensity lasers and high - energy particle beams that can be created by the conventional high - energy physics accelerator will further multiply our ability to expand our frontier horizon",
    ". this will be the merging point of high - energy physics and high - field science . in the following , we list several examples of exciting new frontiers of fundamental physics that may be explored by this regime of intensities .",
    "in many of the applications we discuss , in this high - intensity regime the interaction length between the laser and matter is expected to be extended beyond the rayleigh length , as the relativistic mass effect of electrons sets the self - focusing threshold at @xmath51w  @xcite .",
    "the pulse or self - modulation of a photon wavepacket with sufficient intensity induces a longitudinal electric field ( in the @xmath52-direction , as part of plasma oscillations ) as @xmath53 where @xmath54/@xmath55 and @xmath56 is the electron density , @xmath57 the normalized vector potential of the laser , which is sometimes called the quivering velocity normalized to @xmath58 ( or quivering momentum normalized to @xmath38 ) .",
    "the energy gain over the interaction length @xmath59 is @xmath60 when @xmath61 exceeds unity ( ultrarelativistic ; @xmath62w/@xmath1 ) , the pressure of the photon wavepacket becomes so large that nearly all electrons are evacuated from the laser packet  @xcite .",
    "the photons plow through the plasma with electrons piling up in front of the pulse (  snow plow \" of electrons ) , yielding the snow plow acceleration  @xcite with momentum gain of electrons @xmath63 where @xmath64 . here",
    "the laser pulse is assumed to have fully interacted with the plasma .",
    "if the pulse quickly diffracts before the full interaction , say over the rayleigh length , @xmath65 is simply proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "now let us imagine , for the moment , that the laser has only half the period ( unipolar )  @xcite or subcyclic  @xcite . in this case",
    "the energy ( or momentum ) gain is @xmath66 since the lawson - woodward theorem  @xcite prohibits any overall acceleration for fully oscillatory ( i.e. , usual ) electromagnetic waves in vacuum in infinite space , the above energy gain is compensated for by decelerating phase .",
    "there are , however , many instances that break the theorem requirements .",
    "for example , it may be possible in this extreme relativistic regime that electrons are accelerated to very high energy , immediately reaching the speed of light and becoming in phase with the photon over a sufficiently long distance , so that by the time they become dephased , the em wave may decay away for some reason , such as by radiative decay or pump depletion to the acceleration .",
    "if this happens , the above energy gain ( or a portion of it ) may be preserved . in extreme high - intensity regimes",
    "such effects will become significant .",
    "if the laser spreads over the rayleigh length , the energy gain is proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "the transverse momentum gain @xmath67 is always proportional to @xmath61 . in a broad general way we can say that the interaction between the laser and electrons becomes more coherent , as the laser intensity increases because the laser and electrons move more coherently over greater distance",
    "this is the signature of the acceleration by the ponderomotive potential of photon fields in ultra - relativistic intensity regimes .",
    "thus it is possible to see electrons at energies of up to @xmath68tev at the laser intensity of @xmath69w/@xmath1 and even up to @xmath70pev at @xmath9w/@xmath1 .",
    "the accelerating gradient is @xmath71tev / cm and @xmath33pev / cm , respectively .",
    "note that such energies ( 100  tev and 10  pev ) if collided , correspond to @xmath72ev and @xmath2ev for fixed target experiments .",
    "these energies rival or exceed those of the highest energy cosmic rays , which are observed up to @xmath73ev .",
    "of course , it is not easy to attain correspondingly high luminosity for collisions at such high energies .",
    "even though the exploration of particle physics at pb may not be within reach , we may use such particles in pursuit of ( other ) fundamental physics at the energy frontier .",
    "we might recall that anderson first discovered mesons in cosmic rays , followed by more detailed studies of those particles in cyclotrons and other accelerators .",
    "perhaps the present way - out parameters in the energy frontier may herald some new phenomena .",
    "one such example may be the test of lorentz invariance  @xcite in extreme high energies .",
    "for such a test , unlike the detection of new particles with pb cross - section , the luminosity requirement may be much relaxed .",
    "when we irradiate an extremely relativistic laser pulse @xmath74w/@xmath1 ) on a thin film @xmath75 m ) of a metal at a tight spot of ( @xmath76m)@xmath30 followed by a microhole in a metallic slab over more than one cm , we hypothesize that the laser pulse picks up metallic electrons from the film and continues to propagate through the microhole , as it remains focused .",
    "if this proves to be the case , the amount of electrons that are to be accelerated by this pulse is in the ballpark of @xmath77 where we assumed @xmath78@xmath79 , area @xmath80m)@xmath30 , the bunch length @xmath81 cm . in such a large pickup ,",
    "the pump depletion due to the energy transfer to electrons is significant .",
    "in fact , it may play a fundamental role in this acceleration to turn the electromagnetic energy into particle kinetic energy without returning to the decelerating phase , providing one way to break the lawson - woodward theorem s constraint , as we mentioned earlier .",
    "if we take 1/10 of the above electrons to gain 10 tev and if we focus electrons ( and positrons ) down to @xmath82 cm ( or @xmath83 cm ) at focus ( the collision point ) , the luminosity of the colliding events is of the order of @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the collision repetition rate .",
    "nakajima has considered a similar but more daring luminosity scenario  @xcite .",
    "one special case of laser energy conversion into electrons is through the resonance absorption at the critical density .",
    "the concept of fast ignition in laser - driven inertial fusion  @xcite calls for laser beam of @xmath70psec duration at the intensity exceeding @xmath6w/@xmath86 to be absorbed at the critical density @xmath87/@xmath88 , creating a beam of electrons in the several mev range .",
    "the idea is to separate the roles of laser into two functions : one to compress the fuel with least amount of entropy increase so that the fusion fuel is compressed to a highest density with least amount of laser energy , and the other is to heat the fuel to the thermonuclear ignition temperature ( @xmath70kev ) when the main compression is achieved .",
    "the latter step may be carried out according to tabak  by the appropriate range of energetic ( several mev ) electrons that are transported from the crust of the target @xmath89/@xmath88 to the surface of the fuel ( at @xmath90/@xmath91 ) at the pulse duration of @xmath70ps . in order for electrons to trigger the fusion ignition",
    ", the condition r0.5(gcm^2 ) has to be fulfilled  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath92 is the density of the compressed fuel and @xmath93 the electron range and thus approximately the size of the fuel at compression .",
    "although this idea is potentially capable of reducing the necessary laser energy by almost an order of magnitude or increasing the fusion gain by an order of magnitude at the same laser energy , there remains a considerable uncertainty in the efficiency of energy conversion from short - pulse ( 10ps ) laser to electron beam to the compressed fuel and in the stability and reliability of electron beam .",
    "for example , laser and electron beam have to propagate through the over dense plasma , through which filamentation and kinking instabilities are found to arise . in order to cope with this problem ,",
    "the ignitor laser is further split into the hole boring one and energy deliverer .",
    "we suggest that an alternative method of fast ignition by much shorter - pulse laser may be possible . in this , although the total amount of energy necessary to be delivered is unchanged ( @xmath94kj ) , we shorten the pulse length to 10fs so that the local laser intensity reaches of the order of @xmath34w/@xmath86 .",
    "since the resonance frequency reduces inversely proportional to @xmath95 , the resonance density becomes in the order of @xmath96/@xmath91 , a very close proximity of the fully compressed fuel .",
    "this way we may be avoiding the difficult and long energy transport of electron beam from the density region of @xmath97/@xmath86 to @xmath98/@xmath91 . with the recent success of improved target design with a conic aperture for fast ignitor laser beam access  @xcite , our ultrafast approach may be further bolstered as a direct energy delivery vehicle .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , how much fraction of the laser energy is consumed due to the pump depletion  @xcite while it interacts with the surrounding plasma",
    ". it also needs to be investigated what kind of electron energy spectrum is generated in the ultra - intense laser beam .",
    "the mission of the electron energy conversion in fast ignition is orthogonal to the previous subsec .",
    "3a of super - high energy electron generation .",
    "the production of a small fraction of extremely high - energy electrons is tolerated , as long as the majority of energy is in several mev electrons .",
    "many thought it difficult to accelerate protons and heavier particles by light , as massless light propagates at the speed of light , while protons are massive and nonrelativistic  until last year , when the petawatt laser experiment  @xcite and other experiments  @xcite showed that protons have been accelerated much beyond a mega - electron - volt .",
    "the observed transverse emittance is about 0.5  mm  mrad , while the longitudinal one is about mev - psec  @xcite .",
    "these early experiments already rival or even surpass those of the conventional ion sources in some of crucial parameters .",
    "the main mechanism of laser proton acceleration in the above experiments is due to the space charge set up by energetic electrons that are driven forward away from the back surface of the target slab .",
    "the energy of protons is thus dependent on that of electrons .",
    "bulanov and others showed  @xcite in simulation that at a laser intensity of @xmath99w/@xmath1 , protons are accelerated beyond a giga - electron - volt .",
    "if this process of proton acceleration scales with the intensity ( as the electron energy does ) , we may be able to see 100  gev protons and 10  tev at @xmath100 and @xmath9w/@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "however , it may also be possible that this process is now due directly to the photon pressure beyond the intensity regime of @xmath101w/@xmath1 .",
    "the energy expected through this mechanism is about the same as that through the space charge mechanism .",
    "it is not clear how much energy will be in protons . in the petawatt laser experiment , about 10% of laser energy ( 300",
    "j ) was converted into proton energy  30  j ( beyond 1  mev )  @xcite .",
    "if we take this conversion efficiency in the extreme relativistic laser intensity , then more than 1  kj of proton energy is expected for the case of intensity @xmath69w/@xmath1 .",
    "if we further take a flat energy spectrum , approximately @xmath102 protons are accelerated beyond 10  gev in this intensity regime .",
    "if we can generate the solitary accelerating structure , such energy may exceed 100  gev . if we can converge these in a colliding pair of beams at focus , the luminosity of colliding hadrons is @xmath103 , if we focus on 10  nm .",
    "the expected number of nuclear events is on the order of @xmath104 per shot .",
    "such an intense , relativistic , compact proton source has a number of fascinating applications",
    ". it may be applicable to ion radiography , fast ignition of fusion , etc .",
    ", among many others .",
    "an additional application is pion ( or muon ) and neutrino beam generation . with sufficiently relativistic proton energies",
    "the emittance of created pions can be sufficiently small .",
    "if so , they may be promptly accelerated pions to sufficiently high energies before the space charge effect expands the beam emittance and before they die out . in this",
    "the prompt acceleration and its compactness are important , both of which are the forte of the laser accelerations in an application .",
    "protons beyond a certain energy ( several hundred mev ) in matter induce through the nuclear strong interaction the creation of pions , which in turn decay into muons and neutrinos in a matter of 20  ns , if nonrelativistic , propagating mere 6  m at most : @xmath105 . with the conventional accelerating gradient of , say , 20mev / m over this distance of 6 m",
    ", we can increase the pion energy by 120mev , which will increase the lifetime of pions but not by an order of magnitude . on the other hand",
    ", the laser acceleration with its far - greater gradient would increase the energy and lifetime of pions far more than this ( and also reduce the emission cone angle ) .",
    "this would contribute to a further smaller emittance , which in turn contributes to higher energy , lower emittance muons and neutrinos .",
    "the emission of gamma rays from the intense laser is expected .",
    "although the well - known bremsstrahlung x - rays ( and gamma rays ) by electrons through the collision with nuclei are expected to remain important , the larmor radiation is the most intense in the extreme relativistic regime among all radiation mechanisms through the interaction with matter ( in this case free electrons ) with power @xmath106 gamma rays ( whose energy peaks at @xmath107 ) may be forward directed as electrons are accelerated forward .",
    "in addition , gamma rays of nuclear origin are also expected . as discussed in subsec .",
    "3a , accelerated electrons with extremely large lorentz factor created by laser may be easily converted into extreme high - energy gamma rays ( polarization may be preserved if desired ) .",
    "when an intense laser is directed at a high - energy electron beam , the well - known energy enhancement of laser photon happens by the factor @xmath108 or up to the electron energy itself ( where @xmath43 is the lorentz factor of the head - on colliding electron beam ) through compton scattering .",
    "utilizing this , high - energy electron ( or positron ) colliders may be converted into a @xmath43-@xmath43 collider  @xcite .",
    "the idea of a @xmath43-@xmath43 collider is an example of the cooperative employment of two separate technologies ( the indigeneous high - energy physics and the high - field science ) to enhance the overall goal .",
    "gamma rays in the @xmath43-@xmath43 collider mode or with an enormous energy as discussed in subsec .  3a ( with another laser , for example ) may be employed to test the lorentz invariance  @xcite .",
    "for example , if lorentz invariance is violated , the event number of @xmath109 pair creation is suppressed .",
    "kishimoto and tajima  @xcite have shown that an intense laser pulse may be nearly totally absorbed by only several layers of atomic clusters .",
    "when the excursion length of electrons exceeds the size of clusters , electron orbits become chaotic upon their removal from the original site of the cluster , due to the cluster polarization . the chaos sets in within a few femtoseconds , thus making the absorption of the laser ultrafast .",
    "further , upon removal of electrons , ions of the cluster coulomb - explode , gaining a large fraction of electron energy .",
    "if we arrange matter in such a way as to absorb nearly all laser energy over the thickness of a few microns on a @xmath110m)@xmath30 spot , the average energy per particle is approximately 100  gev and @xmath111gev , at @xmath100 and @xmath9w/@xmath1 , respectively .",

    "probably the amount of positrons generated will not be less than @xmath112  ( see also in subsec .",
    "a large number of nuclear excitations are expected .",
    "in fact , in the petawatt laser experiment  @xcite nuclear transmutations through generated gamma rays have been observed .",
    "since the electron energy is much greater than the typical nuclear excitation energy , copious reactions are expected .",
    "the nuclear reactivity @xmath113 is estimated  @xcite as @xmath114 here @xmath115 and @xmath56 are the ion and electron densities , @xmath14 , the reaction cross - section , @xmath20 and @xmath116 are the interaction time and length , and @xmath117 is the fraction of reaction electrons .",
    "the numbers in the denominator are the normalizing numbers with typical parameters as follows : @xmath118/@xmath55 , @xmath119 , @xmath120b , @xmath121s , @xmath122 .",

    ", the element of hf is excited at energy around 1  mev .",
    "even if a heavy metal is irradiated , the energy per nucleon exceeds 1  gev .",
    "thus by irradiating the target from both ends , it may be possible to cause colliding heavy nuclei .",
    "the possible nuclear events we expect are @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the interaction volume taken as @xmath129@xmath55 .",
    "we expect about @xmath130 events per laser shot of nuclear events , which may include such a process as quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "the presumed transition temperature from nucleon state to deconfined quark - gluon plasma state is @xmath131mev .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) delivers @xmath112 ion beams ( au ) at luminosity of @xmath132/@xmath1/s , yielding a few events of quark - gluon plasma per second .",
    "the photon pressure at the extreme relativistic regime is immense : 30  pbars ( @xmath133mbars ) and 3  ebars , at @xmath98 and @xmath9w/@xmath1 , respectively . with such extraordinarily high pressure ,",
    "one may be able to access entirely new regimes of highly - pressurized matter states .",
    "the current method of achieving the highest pressure and compressed states is to ablate exterior matter outward by laser in order to drive interior matter inward by the reaction momentum .",
    "this way , gradual ( nearly ) isentropic compression to a density @xmath134 higher than the solid density can be achieved with the laser whose pulse is longer than a nanosecond .",
    "the laser light , as well as hot electrons , is absorbed before the interior matter ; the formation of a strong shock , which is detrimental to compression , is avoided . however",
    ", the superstrong pressure in the extreme high - field regime , as well as another set of parameters that come with it , invites us to think about and explore radically different ways than the ablative method to create ultrahigh compressed states .",
    "this may allow us to access densities far greater than @xmath98/@xmath91 .      at the intensity @xmath9w/@xmath1",
    ", the electric field is only an order of magnitude less than the schwinger field as discussed below . at this field ,",
    "fluctuations in vacuum are polarized by laser to yield copious pairs of real electron and positron . in collider physics",
    "a similar phenomenon happens when the so - called @xmath135 parameter reaches unity . in reality , even below the schwinger field , the exponential tail of these fluctuations begins to cause copious pair productions .",
    "though pair production has been demonstrated at slac ( e144-experiment )  @xcite by the interaction of @xmath43-ray with an intense laser at intensities in the range of @xmath36w/@xmath1 , the direct production of pairs by a high - intensity laser from vacuum remains elusive .",
    "the rule of thumb for threshold of pair production derives from the simple argument that it is the field necessary for a virtual electron to gain an energy @xmath136 during its lifetime @xmath137 , imposed by the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath138 , the energy gain length , @xmath139 is the compton length @xmath140 .",
    "hence , the breakdown field @xmath141 , the schwinger field , is @xmath142 where @xmath143pm @xmath144v / cm .",
    "( the laser field @xmath141 is related to the laser intensity @xmath145 by @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the vacuum impedance . for @xmath148",
    ", we find a value of @xmath149w/@xmath1 ) .",
    "this approach gives an estimate for the threshold for pair creation and do not provide the number of pairs that could be created for a given intensity .",
    "the probability of spontaneous production of pair creation per unit time per unit volume by schwinger  @xcite is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the number of pairs @xmath152 for a given laser field is @xmath153 where @xmath128 is the focal volume . for @xmath154@xmath55 and @xmath155fs , we find the generation of @xmath156 pairs at the schwinger intensity @xmath157 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the intensity to create a single pair is still the gargantuan intensity of @xmath158w/@xmath1 .",
    "however , as indicated earlier ( in subsec .",
    "3e ) , the presence of matter such as nuclei or electrons reduces this field by a considerable amount .",
    "the interaction of intense laser with high - energy electrons will enhance some of the parameters even further .",
    "for example , counterstreaming electron beam and laser can produce copious polarized ( high - quality ) positrons .",
    "this can serve as a polarized positron source for one thing . in an extreme field regime , on the other hand",
    ", the laser field is enhanced by the lorentz factor of the electron beam , so that the effective field from the electron frame may far exceed the schwinger value . if this field is exceeded by much more than these orders of magnitude , direct production of other particles such as muons out of `` vacuum '' may be observed .",
    "in addition to the test of nonlinear fields , we are able to explore what may be called ` horizon physics . '",
    "according to einstein s equivalence principle , a particle that is accelerated feels gravity in the opposite direction of the acceleration .",
    "the acceleration due to the electric field of the laser at this intensity is huge : @xmath159 and @xmath160cm / s@xmath30 , at @xmath100 and @xmath9w/@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "an observer at rest ( or in an inertial frame of reference ) sees the horizon at infinity if there is no gravitation . on the other hand ,",
    "an observer near a black hole sees the horizon at a finite distance where the gravitation diverges .",
    "equivalently , an observer who is being accelerated ( feeling immense equivalent gravity ) now also sees the horizon at a finite distance .",
    "any particle (  observer \"  a wave function ) that has a finite extent has one side of its wave function leaking out of the horizon .",
    "the unruh radiation is emitted when this happens  @xcite .",
    "unruh radiation is a sister to the hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "the unruh temperature @xmath161 which is about @xmath111ev and @xmath162ev , for @xmath100 and @xmath9w/@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the radiative power of unruh radiation increases in proportion to @xmath163 ( or @xmath164 ) , in contrast to the larmor radiation power of @xmath165  @xcite @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the electron classical radius . since in the extreme relativistic regime",
    "the radiation is dominated by larmor radiation , the unruh signal has to compete with the larmor with the ratio of powers @xmath168 at this regime , the unruh is down only by a few orders of magnitude , and it has been suggested to circumvent the noise to observe the unruh signal by exploiting polarization , etc .",
    "this @xmath169 yields @xmath111ev / s and @xmath170ev / s , for @xmath100 and @xmath9w/@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the shrinkage of the distance to the horizon by the violent acceleration allows us to probe other aspects of gravitational physics .",
    "for example , arkani - hamed  @xcite suggested that extra dimensions of the quantum gravity may have manifestations in a relatively low extra dimension @xmath171 in this four - dimensional world .",
    "the distance over which this may be manifested is r_n~10 ^ 30/n-17  .[ark1 ] the distance to the horizon created by the intense laser acceleration of an electron d = c^2a_e=21a_0,[ark2 ] could exceed the above distance eq .",

    "zetta- and exawatt - lasers will allow us a glimpse into some of the most energetic and enigmatic phenomena of astrophysics such as grb s , and their associated effects on ehecr , the final energy frontier in the universe ( ` extreme universe ' in the highest energy and from the cosmological distance ) .",
    "we marvel at such fascinating possibilities of exploring fundamental physics that are enabled by the extreme high - field science developments by zetta and exawatt lasers , even though we have just barely scratched the surface so far on this subject .",
