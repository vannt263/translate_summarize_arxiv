    "on 27 march 2004 , students from across the midwest united states gathered at the rose - hulman institute of technology for the 2004 mupec ( midwest undergraduate private engineering colleges ) conference .",
    "this is an annual conference sponsored by the mupec group , comprising the institutions listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "a different institution hosts the event each year .",
    "participants presented papers or posters on projects in mathematics , computer , and engineering disciplines , and also participated in a multidisciplinary design competition .",
    "this paper will focus on the design competition developed by the authors , and especially the cryptography problem which students had to solve .",
    "the challenge for the conference organizers is to create a design problem suitable for students from a variety of science , mathematics and engineering disciplines .",
    "our goal in designing the competition was to create a day - long design problem suitable for undergraduates in engineering , mathematics and science .",
    "[ table1 ]    .mupec member institutions [ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "the purpose of the workshop was to familiarize the students both with the ciphers they were going to be breaking and the software they were going to be using to assist them .",
    "the workshop introduced three types of ciphers : additive ciphers ( a.k.a shift ciphers or general caesar ciphers ) , affine ciphers , and two - by - two hill ciphers ( a.k.a .",
    "matrix ciphers ) . for each of the three types of cipher we took the students through a similar routine .",
    "first , we gave a brief explanation and an example .",
    "then we had the students encipher a given message by hand using a given key . to check their answer",
    ", we showed them how to decipher the message using custom software , as described below .",
    "( the workshop was held in a computer - equipped classroom . ) after that , we talked about how to break the cipher using frequency distributions .",
    "we showed them how to use the software to determine and test a probable key for the cipher .",
    "finally , we let the students practice breaking a set of sample ciphers programmed into the software .",
    "slides from the workshop are available on the web at  @xcite , under `` competition materials '' .",
    "the software was written by scott for the workshop and the competition .",
    "it was written in java and distributed as a web - based applet .",
    "there were three functions for each cipher : construct a letter frequency distribution ( or , in the case of the hill cipher , a digraph frequency distribution ) , recover a probable key based on a ( very small ) set of ciphertext - plaintext pairs , and decipher the message based on the probable key .",
    "the codebreaking functions for the additive and affine ciphers , which are letter substitution ciphers , were based on the letter frequency method . in this method",
    ", the codebreaker prepares a `` letter frequency distribution '' showing how often each ciphertext letter appears in the text .",
    "this is then compared against the known average frequency of letters in english plaintext ; `` e '' is the most common , `` t '' is next , and so on . in the case of the additive cipher",
    "the key may be recovered from the knowledge of a single plaintext - ciphertext pair : the key consists of the numerical value of the ciphertext letter minus the value of the corresponding plaintext letter , modulo 26 . thus if the codebreaker can correctly guess the ciphertext letter corresponding to `` e '' , he or she can obtain the key and decipher the message .    for the affine cipher ,",
    "the numerical value of the plaintext letter is multiplied by the first key number and added to the second key number , modulo 26 , to obtain the numerical value of the ciphertext letter .",
    "thus the key can be recovered from the knowledge of two plaintext - ciphertext pairs , which sets up a system of two equations in two unknowns which the codebreaker can ( hopefully ) solve .",
    "for example , if the codebreaker can correctly guess , from the letter frequency distribution , the ciphertext letters corresponding to `` e '' and `` t '' , he or she can obtain the key .    the hill cipher is slightly different because it is a block substitution cipher . in the two - by - two case used in the workshop , each pair of consecutive plaintext numbers is multiplied by the key matrix modulo 26 to obtain a pair of ciphertext numbers . therefore recovering the key requires the knowledge of two different plaintext - ciphertext correspondences , each consisting of a plaintext pair and the corresponding ciphertext pair . in this case",
    "the codebreaker prepares a `` digraph frequency distribution '' showing how often each possible pair of ciphertext letters appears consecutively in the text .",
    "this is then compared against the average frequency of letter pairs in english plaintext .",
    "this is not as well known as for letter frequencies , but it has been found that `` th '' is the most common letter pair , followed by `` he '' , and so on . if the codebreaker now successfully guesses the ciphertext pairs corresponding to `` th '' and `` he '' , he or she can solve two matrix equations in two unknowns and once again obtain the key .",
    "the software was designed to aid this process as follows : the user entered a ciphertext or selected one out of a sample set of ciphertexts .",
    "then he or she used the software to create either a letter frequency or digraph frequency distribution .",
    "the user then determined a probable key as follows : for the case of an additive cipher , the user entered a guess for the ciphertext equivalent of plaintext `` e '' ; for an affine cipher guesses for both `` e '' and `` t '' were entered ; and for the two - by - two hill cipher guesses for the pairs `` th '' and `` he '' were entered .",
    "the `` attack '' function of the software solved the appropriate equations and returned the corresponding key , or a message that no such key was possible .",
    "( the equations were unsolvable . ) if a key was returned , the user went on to the deciphering function and attempted to decipher the messages .",
    "the students were made aware that all of the plaintext messages used in the contest were recognizable ( if not necessarily meaningful ) english sentences , so that it was immediately apparent if the key was correct .",
    "the software , including sample ciphertexts , is available at  @xcite , under `` competition and software '' , and screen shots are shown in figures  [ fig : frequency ] and  [ fig : decrypt ] .",
    "students were told that ciphertexts 110 were encrypted with an additive cipher , ciphertexts 1120 were encrypted with an affine cipher , and ciphertexts 2130 were encrypted with a hill cipher .",
    "[ fig : frequency ]        [ fig : decrypt ]    students were directed to pay special attention to the form of the decrypted sample messages , which were constructed in exactly the same manner as the plaintext of the messages used in the actual competition .",
    "each message started with a four digit pin ( spelled out in words ) , which was the only part of the message that the students needed to know in the actual competition .",
    "the rest of the message consisted of several meaningless ( but grammatically correct ) sentences which were chosen at random by a computer program from a list .",
    "the list was constructed to try to produce a large number of `` e ' 's , `` t ' 's , `` th ' 's , and `` he ' 's in order to make the frequency distribution attack feasible with a reasonably small number of guesses .",
    "however , this was not completely successful for the case of the hill cipher , and some of the sample texts required quite a few guesses .",
    "one `` round '' was conducted for each team ; for each round an `` offensive '' and a `` defensive '' team was picked such that each team got exactly one offensive and one defensive opportunity .",
    "the offensive team s rocket was loaded into the underwater missile - launching tube .",
    "the hackers from the offensive and defensive teams were each seated at a laptop computer with the workshop software installed and a set of ciphertexts loaded which they had not seen before . all ciphertexts used in the actual contest involved affine ciphers , and this was made known to the contestants at the start of the contest . also loaded onto the computers was control software written by laurence merkle which took a round number and a four digit pin and checked the pin to see if it corresponded to the ciphertext for that round .",
    "if the pin was correct , the software was programmed to send a signal to a switching module designed and built by tina hudson .",
    "the switching module was built to determine which of the two laptops had sent the signal first .",
    "the intended plan for the switching module was that if the offensive team sent the signal first then the module would produce a `` launch '' result which would connect a six - volt battery to the ignitor of the model rocket , causing the rocket to launch .",
    "if the defense succeeded first the module would produce a `` no - launch '' result and the rocket would not launch .",
    "( due to electrical issues this result was not conveyed directly to the rocket launcher during the actual competition ; rather an indicator light indicated which team had succeeded first .",
    "the electrical issues have since been resolved , and a new launch board has been built and tested for future use . )    in the actual execution , the round was started with an announcement of the round number and the simultaneous starting of a stopwatch for each team .",
    "the hackers then proceeded to enter the round number into the workshop software and get their ciphertext , which they attempted to break .",
    "( for fairness , both teams received the same problem . ) when they had broken the text and obtained the four - digit number they entered the number into the control software , which determined if it was correct .",
    "each team s stopwatch was stopped when the correct code number was recognized .",
    "both of the measured times were used in scoring , so both hackers were directed to proceed until they had broken the cipher .",
    "the winner of the ciphertext competition was announced , and in either case the rocket was launched so that its performance could be used in the scoring .",
    "figure  [ fig : rocket ] presents a schematic of the competition .",
    "[ fig : rocket ]    team scores for the competition as a whole were based on the performance of the rocket ( 65% ) , the accuracy of the team s prediction of the performance of the rocket ( 12% ) , the aesthetics of the painted nose - cones of the rockets ( 3% ) , and the code - breaking times for both the offensive opportunity ( 10% ) and the defensive opportunity ( 10% ) .",
    "timing scores were calculated using the time measured as a fraction of the maximum time measured for any team in any round .",
    "another scoring possibility might take into account the `` head - to - head '' nature of the competition more directly . also",
    ", the system we used did not account for the possibility that some ciphertexts might be more difficult to decipher than others .",
    "our goal in designing the competition was to create a day - long design problem suitable for undergraduates in engineering , mathematics and science disciplines .",
    "surveys filled out by the students support this goal , both in general ( see  @xcite ) and in the cryptography part of the competition .",
    "students were originally not very confident of their ability to break codes and ciphers and to use matrices to encipher messages , but they indicated that they gained confidence after attending the workshop and practicing ( or watching their teammates practice ) these skills over the course of the day .",
    "however , the students indicated that they had lost confidence in their ability to encrypt messages using a simple cipher .",
    "we hypothesize that students on average were perhaps not aware before the workshop of some of the complexities of what could be considered a `` simple '' cipher , and were thus overconfident .",
    "we think the surveys indicate that on average , some level of learning has occurred for a mixed group of students from different disciplines and different institutions .",
    "quite a bit of time and effort went in to putting this competition together .",
    "we estimate that prof .",
    "holden put in about 30 hours of work on the design of the cryptography part of the competition and preparing the cryptography workshop .",
    "hudson spent about 20 hours for the switching module .",
    "layton put in about 80 hours of work on the design and testing of the launch - tube apparatus , coordinating the overall competition design , and organizing the conference .",
    "merkle spent an estimated 50 hours on the control software .",
    "erin bender and gerald rea , mechanical engineering majors at rose - hulman , put in approximately 100 hours of work on the original analysis and simulation for the design as well as the building and testing and redesign of the physical apparatus .",
    "they were compensated for this as work - study employees .",
    "scott dial put in approximately 10 hours of work on the workshop software , for which he was compensated with extra credit in prof .",
    "holden s cryptography class .    however , much of this would effort would not have to be duplicated by someone putting on a similar competition .",
    "complete plans and instructions for all aspects of the competition are or will be posted at  @xcite and we estimate that a person or team of people with the appropriate expertise could reproduce the competition in perhaps a quarter of the time we spent .",
    "our thanks to so many without whom this design problem and competition simply would not have come together in time : our colleagues and coworkers ray bland , patsy brackin , gary burgess , pat carlson , mike fulk , and mike mcleish , and our students erin bender , scott dial and gerald rea .",
