    "ultracold fermionic atoms have attracted a lot of attention in the last decade .",
    "the fermions here can exhibit bcs pairing or can form molecules and undergo bose einstein condensation(bec ) .",
    "the crossover from bcs to bec can be controlled by a magnetic field capable of providing feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "an interesting variation in this situation is the introduction of an imbalance in the fermion number .",
    "pairing now has to work around the fact that not all fermions of type a(one of the species ) have a fermion of type b to pair with .",
    "this is equivalent to considering superconductivity in the presence of an external magnetic field which creates an imbalance of spin up and spin down states .",
    "the consequence can be exotic pairing states like fflo@xcite , sarma ( breached pair ) phase@xcite , phase separation @xcite .",
    "these are , however , notoriously difficult to detect experimentally .",
    "dynamics is a very important attribute of ultracold systems and has been studied extensively .",
    "barankov et al .",
    "discussed the collective nonlinear evolution of bcs state when the pairing interaction is turned on instantaneously @xcite . v. a andreev et al .",
    "showed that when the position of the feshbach resonance is changed abruptly , the superfluid undergoes a coherent bec - to - bcs oscillation@xcite",
    ". m. h. szymanska et al.@xcite addressed the situation when the feshbach magnetic field jumps suddenly , and studied the short time dynamics that followed  damped oscillations with an amplitude depending on initial conditions .",
    "they also argued that atom - molecule oscillations are negligible for all practical purposes .",
    "all these authors concentrated on following the system after a rapid change .",
    "this entails the study of the nonlinear term in the evolution equation .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at studying the dynamical properties of a population - imbalanced fermi gas but without introducing a sudden change in feshbach magnetic field .",
    "we focus on the linear dynamics of the system when a natural fluctuation of bec condensate occurs along the bcs - bec crossover path , and the system tries to relax back to the steady state . in the process",
    "we find that it shows periodic or quasiperiodic oscillations .",
    "the strength of the feshbach term determines whether the oscillation will be periodic or quasi periodic .",
    "the frequencies of motion are found to be sensitive to the pairing in the momentum space .",
    "we propose that a time dependent feshbach coupling can be used to probe the pairing structures in momentum space .",
    "this can provide another handle on exploring experimentally the exotic pairing states .",
    "here we start with a two - species fermionic system . in addition to the fermion - fermion interaction ( denoted by @xmath0 ) , there is an additional interaction ( @xmath1 ) of the feshbach variety which couples two fermions to form a bosonic molecule .",
    "our model resembles the one used in @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the fields for the two fermions , and @xmath4 represents the bosonic field .",
    "our hamiltonian is :    @xmath5    next we calculate the commutation relations in order to arrive at the equations of motion .",
    "this is in line with the ehrenfest theorem , which relates the time derivative of the expectation value for a quantum mechanical operator to the commutator of that operator with the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "heisenberg operators are introduced as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the equations of motion are :    @xmath8 e^{-ih t/\\hbar}=\\epsilon_p{\\psi_h}_\\uparrow + g\\langle { \\psi_p}_\\uparrow { \\psi_p}_\\downarrow\\rangle { { \\psi_h}_\\downarrow}^\\dagger + g_2{{\\psi_h}_\\downarrow}^\\dagger \\phi\\\\ i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial{{\\psi_h}_\\downarrow}^\\dagger}{\\partial t}=e^{ih t/\\hbar}[{\\psi_p}^\\dagger_\\downarrow , h ] e^{-ih t/\\hbar}=\\epsilon_p{{\\psi_h}_\\downarrow}^\\dagger + g\\langle { { \\psi_p}_\\downarrow}^\\dagger { { \\psi_p}_\\uparrow}^\\dagger\\rangle { \\psi_h}_\\uparrow+ g_2{\\psi_h}_\\uparrow\\phi^\\dagger\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ]    let us now define the pair wavefunction .",
    "@xmath9 it turns out that @xmath10 here @xmath11 , i.e , the total population corresponding to a particular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "now , @xmath13 represents the expectation value of the pair wave function in the heisenberg picture while @xmath14 is the same quantity in the schroedinger s picture .",
    "since these are expectation values , they should not depend on the choice of the representation .",
    "so we can replace @xmath13 by @xmath15 as well .",
    "moreover , when both the pairing states are occupied , ( e.g , in region of bcs pairing ) , @xmath16 therefore ,    @xmath17    as for the evolution of @xmath4 @xmath18    a quick comparison shows that these are linearized versions of the evolution equations in @xcite , which is the relevant part for our calculation .",
    "the non linear terms are essential for dynamics following a sudden quench .",
    "the first test of the new theory is that , whether we can reproduce previously established results as special cases of the new formalism .",
    "so we try to go back to the static case using these dynamical equations . + we define a single particle green s function in the momentum space .",
    "@xmath19\\rangle$ ] and @xmath20\\rangle$ ] and find that    @xmath21    a direct analogy with the standard bcs @xcite leads to the relation @xmath22    in the static case , let the condensate order parameter be a constant , i.e , @xmath23 + from equations ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ geff5 ] ) , @xmath24.if the fermion - fermion four point interaction is an attractive one ( which is indeed the case for a bcs superfluid ) , then taking the effective interection @xmath25 in the attractive sense and writing @xmath26 , we arrive at",
    "@xmath27    this expression matches with the one obtained using diagrammatic methods @xcite and variational technique @xcite so , here we are able to reproduce the same results without having to use a trial form of the ground state of the system . the ehrenfest theorem and the commutation relations have directly landed us here , and this treatment is certainly more general in nature .",
    "let , @xmath28 be the fluctuation in @xmath15 , and @xmath29 be the fluctuation in @xmath4 , therefore ,    @xmath30    @xmath31    we take the respective fourier transforms and find that @xmath32    so far , the treatment has been general , and the population balance or imbalance has never been taken into account .",
    "now we come to the specific situation where there are two species of fermions , or may be , two hyperfine states of the same atom ( for simplicity , we have used the @xmath33 and @xmath34 to denote them ) : but the one has a larger population than the other . in the momentum picture , this corresponds to a particular geometry .",
    "the natural choice is that of a two - tier structure , one consisting of the paired superfluid , and another comprising of a normal fermi liquid made of the remaining unpaired fermions .",
    "it is shown that@xcite a population - imbalanced breached pair state is stable only when the core is normal and the outer shell , superfluid .        in the above figure ,",
    "the shell structure in momentum space is depicted .",
    "the unpaired majority fermions stay in the core region , which is a normal fluid .",
    "the pair superfluid forms the outer shell , from momenta @xmath35 to @xmath36 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 form the momenta boundaries between which the fermions form bcs - like pairs .",
    "+ experimental results obtained by the ketterle group at mit@xcite , too , confirms this structure . in a strongly interacting fermi gas with imbalanced populations",
    ", they observed a superfluid region surrounded by a normal gas in the form of a shell structure in the coordinate space .",
    "now , the structure we described above ( normal core and superfluid shell ) , when mapped into real space via a fourier transformation shows a high density of superfluid in the centre ( i.e , the picture obtained by shin et al . ) provided the population imbalance is not too high . our fourier space calculation shown that this holds till @xmath37 .",
    "now , @xmath38 is the measure of the population imbalance of the system , and indeed from the experimental results obtained by shin et al .",
    ", this core and shell structure survives upto a population imbalance of 75 percent ( i.e , when @xmath39 ) .",
    "so our calculation matches with their findings within an error margin of 20 percent .",
    "thus , @xmath40 has to be summed over the superfluid region , i.e , over all @xmath12 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath41 let @xmath42 be the fermi momentum and @xmath43 the mass of the atoms .",
    "therefore @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "integrating eq.([sumo])by parts , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 $ ] putting back in eq([phi2 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath49=0 $ ] + which means , @xmath50 is zero if @xmath51\\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , in the expansion of @xmath52 , only those @xmath50s will survive for which @xmath53    therefore , @xmath54    here @xmath55 , @xmath56 .. are the solutions of equation ( [ omega ] ) .    to find out wheter there",
    "exists real values for @xmath57 , we take resort to graphical solutions .",
    "we are only interested in real @xmath57 , because that would give us solutions in the form of @xmath58 , which denotes oscillation . if , on the other hand , we get imaginery solutions for @xmath57 , then the solutions are of the form @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "the first one signifies an exponential growth in @xmath4 and is , therefore , unphysical .",
    "the second one marks exponential decay , and its effect should be negligible as time increases .",
    "so we look out for real solutions only .    from equation ( [ omega ] ) , the roots of @xmath57 are given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "so we plot @xmath57 along x - axis and both @xmath63 and @xmath57 along y - axis .",
    "the blue lines correspond to @xmath63 and the red lines mark @xmath57 . if the two lines cut at any point , we get real solutions of the equation at that point .",
    "we scale all energies by the fermi energy @xmath64 , and all momenta by the fermi momentum @xmath42 of the majority species .",
    "therefore , in this convention , mass of each partcle gets fixed at 0.5 .",
    "@xmath65 is taken as 1 .",
    "* when the imbalance is fixed and @xmath1 is varied : * the bcs pairing takes place near the fermi surface , within a cut - off region . for standard superconductors ,",
    "this cut - off is @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the debye frequency . for ultracold atoms ,",
    "the cut - off is @xmath68=@xmath69 @xcite .",
    "since we have scaled all energies by @xmath64 , fermi level corresponds to @xmath70 , and the lower cut - off is at @xmath71 .",
    "thus we have to choose @xmath35 to lie between 0.459 and 1 .",
    "we take @xmath36 to be 1 , the fermi momentum .     with @xmath57 and solutions for @xmath72 for different values of @xmath1,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath57 and solutions for @xmath72 for different values of @xmath1,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath57 and solutions for @xmath72 for different values of @xmath1,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath57 and solutions for @xmath72 for different values of @xmath1,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath57 and solutions for @xmath72 for different values of @xmath1,title=\"fig : \" ]    we take @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 at @xmath76 . from figure 5.2 , we see that when @xmath1 is @xmath77 , there is only one point where @xmath63 and @xmath57 cut one another , i.e , only one real solution for @xmath57 .",
    "a single solution exists for @xmath78 as well . as this coupling",
    "is increased slightly , at @xmath79 , there appears two such points , i.e , two real @xmath57s . then , as @xmath1 obtains higher values , there are always two real solutions for @xmath57 .",
    "so we can call @xmath79 a critical coupling .",
    "if @xmath1 is less than this coupling value , there is only one real frequency of oscillation in @xmath80 . beyond it , there are two frequencies .",
    "* when @xmath1 is fixed and the population imbalance is varied : * now @xmath36 has been fixed at @xmath70 , @xmath75 at @xmath76 .",
    "we vary @xmath35 , which measures the amount of imbalance , because it is up to momentum @xmath35 that the majority fermions remain unpaired .     with @xmath57 and critical coupling for different values of population imbalance.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath57 and critical coupling for different values of population imbalance.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath57 and critical coupling for different values of population imbalance.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath57 and critical coupling for different values of population imbalance.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure 5.3 , we observe that when the population imbalance is very low ( @xmath35 is 0.5 , i.e , a value slightly higher than the lower cut - off for pairing ) , the double frequency region appears at @xmath79 . as the imbalance is increased gradually , the value of the critical coupling decreases .    thus , the fluctuation in @xmath4 can undergo oscillation with 1 ) one frequency 2 ) two frequencies 3 ) no frequency at all , depending on the value of @xmath1 .    in case 1 , @xmath81 , or , @xmath82    in case 2 , @xmath83 , or , @xmath84    in case 3 , @xmath85 , because the fluctuation decays exponentially .",
    "let us add a small oscillatory component to the magnetic field .",
    "so , instead of @xmath1 , the coupling is of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "we can make a perturbative expansion + @xmath88 + @xmath89    where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the values of @xmath80 and @xmath92 when there is no oscillatory part in the coupling . noting that @xmath93 , it follows that @xmath94    taking fourier transforms as before , + @xmath95    here @xmath96 .",
    "now , @xmath97 is non - zero only when @xmath98 and its value at that particular frequency is    @xmath99    there is a resonance when the denominator becomes zero , i.e , @xmath100 but we know , @xmath101 .",
    "subtracting , @xmath102    since @xmath103 is associated with the feshbach resonance , by tuning the frequency of the time - dependent magnetic field , we can control @xmath103 .",
    "if , for a particular @xmath103 the above equation is satisfied , then we have a sharp resonance in the fluctuation is @xmath4 .",
    "if , @xmath104 , following the same treatment,@xmath97 is non - zero only when @xmath105 or @xmath106 , and its values at those frequencies are + @xmath107 and @xmath108 + respectively .",
    "therefore , resonance will take place when @xmath103 satisfies either of the equations :    @xmath109    it is obvious that @xmath110 is a trivial solution of the equations .",
    "again we take resort to graphical solutions to find out whether non - zero real solutions exist for @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath111    so we plot @xmath103 along x - axis and both @xmath112 and @xmath103 along y - axis .",
    "the blue lines correspond to @xmath112 and the red lines mark @xmath103 .",
    "if the two lines cut at any point , we get real solutions of the equation at that point .     with @xmath103 and solutions for @xmath113 for different values of @xmath1 and corresponding @xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath103 and solutions for @xmath113 for different values of @xmath1 and corresponding @xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath103 and solutions for @xmath113 for different values of @xmath1 and corresponding @xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath103 and solutions for @xmath113 for different values of @xmath1 and corresponding @xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath103 and solutions for @xmath113 for different values of @xmath1 and corresponding @xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]    experimentally one can detect the oscillation frequencies . if an oscillatory component is added to the feshbach coupling , and its frequency is tuned , then at a particular frequency there is a sharp resonance in the condensate fraction .",
    "we propose an algorithm for determining the imbalance : chose a @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is set to 1 because at zero temperature it is the fermi momentum of the majority species , by which all momenta are scaled)so that the numerically computed oscillation frequencies match with those obtained in the experiment .",
    "then use those frequencies and the external resonant frequency to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "if this does nt match with the initial @xmath35 , use the new values as input for the first step . iterating the process a number of times",
    ", one should arrive at the actual value of the breaching point , or the point which marks the separation in the momentum space .",
    "here we have studied the natural dynamics of a population - imbalanced fermionic system capable of making a bcs - bec crossover .",
    "we have shown that the condensate fraction shows a periodic or a quasi periodic oscillation , depending on the value of the feshbach coupling .",
    "there is a critical coupling below which the oscillation is always periodic , and its value depends on the population imbalance .",
    "we have shown that if there is an oscillatory component in the feshbach term , one can achieve a sharp resonance in the condensate fraction by tuning the frequency of the external magnetic field .",
    "the breaching momentum can be calculated from this frequency value .",
    "thus it proves to be an indirect method of experimentally determining the momentumspace structure of the imbalanced fermi system .    this treatment can be extended to detect more complicated structures in the momentum space , too .",
    "the fflo state , which arises due do finite momentum pairing , should also get reflected in a similar dynamical study .",
    "the finite pairing momentum is then embedded in the bosonic field . if we use a single wave number @xmath114 in operator @xmath4 in our original hamiltonian to represent the finite momentum , the oscillatory dynamics and the resonant frequencies should contain information regarding @xmath114 , and thus portray both the momentum structure and the nature of pairing .",
