    "over the years , relativistic potentials involving mixtures of vector and scalar couplings has received attention in the literature .",
    "heavy meson spectra can be explained by solutions of the dirac equation with a convenient mixture of vector and scalar potentials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the same can be said about the treatment of the nuclear phenomena describing the influence of the nuclear medium on the nucleons @xcite .",
    "spin and pseudospin symmetries are su(2 ) symmetries of a dirac equation with vector and scalar potentials realized when the difference between the potentials , or their sum , is a constant .",
    "the near realization of these symmetries may explain degeneracies in some heavy meson spectra ( spin symmetry ) @xcite-@xcite or in single - particle energy levels in nuclei ( pseudospin symmetry ) @xcite-@xcite , when these physical systems are described by relativistic mean - field theories with scalar and vector potentials .",
    "when these symmetries are realized , they decouple the upper and lower components of the dirac equation , so the energy spectrum does not depend on the spinorial structure , being identical to the spectrum of a spinless particle @xcite .",
    "although the scalar potential finds many of their applications in nuclear and particle physics , it could also simulate an effective mass in solid state physics and so it could be useful for modelling transitions between structures such a josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "in fact , there has been a continuous interest for solving the dirac equations in the four - dimensional space - time as well as in lower dimensions for a variety of potentials and couplings .",
    "a few recent works have been devoted to the investigation of the solutions of the dirac equation by assuming that the vector potential has the same magnitude as the scalar potential @xcite whereas other works take a more general mixing @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional step potential is of certain interest to model the transition between two structures . in solid state physics , for example , a step - like potential which changes continuously over an interval",
    "whose dimensions are of the order of the interatomic distances can be used to model the average potential which holds the conduction electrons in metals .",
    "due to weak potentials , relativistic effects are considered  to be small in solid state physics , but the dirac equation can give relativistic corrections to the results obtained from the nonrelativistic equation . in the presence of strong potentials , though , the schrdinger equation must be replaced by their relativistic counterparts .",
    "the background of the kink configuration of the @xmath0 model @xcite is of interest in quantum field theory where topological classical backgrounds are responsible for inducing a fractional fermion number on the vacuum .",
    "models of these kinds , known as kink models are obtained in quantum field theory as the continuum limit of linear polymer models @xcite . in a recent paper",
    "the complete set of bound states of fermions in the presence of this sort of kink - like smooth step potential has been addressed by considering a pseudoscalar coupling in the dirac equation @xcite .    in the present work the scattering a fermion in the background of a sign potential",
    "is considered with a general mixing of vector and scalar lorentz structures with the scalar coupling stronger than or equal to the vector coupling .",
    "it is shown that a special unitary transformation preserving the form of the current decouples the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor .",
    "then the scattering problem is assessed under a sturm - liouville perspective . the unique pole in the transmission amplitude is not related to a proper bound state .",
    "nevertheless , an isolated solution from the sturm - liouville perspective is present .",
    "it is shown that , when the magnitude of the scalar coupling exceeds the vector coupling , the fermion under a strong potential can be trapped in a highly localized region without manifestation of klein s paradox .",
    "it is also shown that this curious lonely bound - state solution disappears asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the realization of spin and pseudospin symmetries .",
    "the dirac equation for a free fermion of rest mass @xmath1 reads@xmath2where @xmath3 is the momentum operator , @xmath4 is the velocity of light , @xmath5 is the unit matrix and the square matrices @xmath6 satisfy the algebra @xmath7 in order to all the components of the spinor @xmath8 satisfy the klein - gordon equation . in 1 + 1 dimensions",

    ", one finds the continuity equation @xmath24 , where the conserved current is @xmath25 .",
    "the positive - definite function @xmath26 , is interpreted as a position probability density and its norm is a constant of motion .",

    "the most general matrix potential preserving the current conservation can be written in terms of well - defined lorentz structures as @xmath31we say that @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the vector , scalar and pseudoscalar potentials , respectively , because the bilinear forms @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 behave like vector , scalar and pseudoscalar quantities under a lorentz transformation , respectively . in this case",

    "the space component of the vector potential can be gauged away by defining a new spinor just differing from the old by a phase factor so that we can consider @xmath43 without loss of generality .    introducing the unitary operator    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a real quantity such that @xmath46 , one can write@xmath47where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 takes the form    @xmath50 + i\\gamma ^{1}\\left [ \\left ( mc^{2}+v_{s}\\right )",

    "we do @xmath52 and use the representation @xmath53 and @xmath54 in such a way that @xmath55 . here , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 stand for the pauli matrices .",
    "the charge - conjugation operation is accomplished by the transformation @xmath59 followed by @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "one sees that the charge conjugation interchanges the roles of the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath63 distinguishes fermions from antifermions but @xmath33 does not , and so the spectrum is symmetrical about @xmath64 in the case of a pure scalar potential .",

    "this means that fermions ( antifermions ) , for weak potentials , are subject to the effective potential @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) with energy @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , a mixed potential with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) is associated with free fermions ( antifermions ) in a nonrelativistic regime .    in terms of the upper and the lower components of the spinor @xmath81",

    "one can solve the dirac problem for determining the possible discrete or continuous eigenvalues of the system by recurring to the solution of a schrdinger - like problem .",

    "for @xmath130 , the effective potentialincludes an attractive ( a repulsive ) delta function at the origin if @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect scattering states in all the circumstances . nevertheless , bound - state solutions should not be expected for @xmath109 and @xmath132 .",
    "we demand that @xmath96 be continuous at @xmath133 , that is@xmath134otherwise , the differential equation for @xmath96 would contain the derivative of a @xmath135-function .",
    "effects on @xmath136 in the neighbourhood of @xmath137 can be evaluated by integrating the differential equation for @xmath96 from @xmath138 to @xmath139 and taking the limit @xmath140 .",
    "the connection formula between @xmath141 at the right and @xmath136 at the left can be summarized as@xmath142one can also see that , despite the discontinuity of @xmath136 for @xmath116 , @xmath29 is a continuous function .",
    "we turn our attention to scattering states for fermions coming from the left .",
    "then , @xmath81 for @xmath143 describes an incident wave moving to the right and a reflected wave moving to the left , and @xmath81 for @xmath144 describes a transmitted wave moving to the right or an evanescent wave .",
    "the upper components for scattering states are written as @xmath145where    @xmath146    note that @xmath147 is a real number for a progressive wave and an imaginary number an evanescent wave ( @xmath148 is a real number ) .",
    "therefore,@xmath149 in fact , if @xmath150 , then @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) will describe the incident ( reflected ) wave , and @xmath153 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath154 , then @xmath152 ( @xmath151 ) will describe the incident ( reflected ) wave , and @xmath155 .    with the connection formulas ( [ cont ] ) and ( [ discont ] ) , and omitting the algebraic details , we state the solution for the transmission amplitudes@xmath156to determine the transmission coefficient we use the current densities @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the @xmath159-independent space component of the current allows us to define the transmission coefficient as@xmath160so that@xmath161taking no regard if @xmath150 or @xmath154",
    ". nevertheless , scattering states are possible only if @xmath162 . for @xmath163 and @xmath164 , the transmission coefficient as a function of @xmath90",
    "is illustrated in figure 1 . as @xmath165 , @xmath166 as it should .",
    "for @xmath150 , this is a profile typical for the nonrelativistic scattering in a step potential or in a delta potential .",
    "the same profile is observed for other values of @xmath45 and @xmath167 .",
    "figure 2 shows the transmission coefficient as a function of the mixing angle .",
    "those intriguing results are readily explained by observing that the effective potential presents an ascendant ( descendant ) step for small ( large ) values of @xmath45 .",
    "the transmission coefficient vanishes for enough small mixing angles and energies because the effective energy is smaller than the height of the effective step potential . for @xmath168 ,",
    "the absence of scattering for enough large mixing angles and enough small energies occurs because the effective energy is smaller than the effective step potential in the region of incidence ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the possibility of bound states requires a solution given by ( [ phi ] ) with @xmath169 and @xmath170 , or @xmath171 and @xmath172 , to obtain a square - integrable @xmath96 .",
    "this means that @xmath173 . on the other hand , if one considers the transmission amplitude as a function of the complex variables @xmath174 one sees that for @xmath175 one obtains the scattering states whereas the bound states would be obtained by the poles lying along the imaginary axis of the complex @xmath176-plane .",
    "these poles are given by the equation @xmath177equation ( [ cq ] ) is the quantization condition . because @xmath178 is a positive quantity , one concludes the bound states are impossible for @xmath179 or @xmath107 , as has been anticipated from the qualitative discussions .",
    "in fact , squaring ( [ cq ] ) results in the form of a second - degree algebraic equation@xmath180which presents just one solution : @xmath181 .",
    "evidently , it is not a proper solution of the problem .      as commented before , there is no solution for @xmath107 , and the normalizable solution for @xmath109 requires @xmath168:@xmath182 |x|\\right\\ }    \\label{s1}\\]]for @xmath183 , and@xmath184 |x|\\right\\ }    \\label{s2}\\]]for @xmath185 .",
    "here , @xmath186from ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) , one readily finds the position probability density to be@xmath187 |x|\\right\\ } \\label{den}\\]]the position probability density is graphed in fig . 3 for two different signs of @xmath167 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath159 given by@xmath188therefore , the fermion tends to concentrate at the left ( right ) region when @xmath189 ( @xmath132 ) , and tends to avoid the origin more and more as @xmath190 decreases .",
    "the fermion is confined within an interval @xmath191 given by@xmath192one can see that the best localization occurs for a pure scalar coupling .",
    "in fact , the fermion becomes delocalized as @xmath193 decreases .",
    "if @xmath194 shrinks with rising @xmath195 or @xmath193 then @xmath196 ( uncertainty in the momentum ) will swell , in consonance with the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum uncertainty in the momentum is given by @xmath197 requiring that is impossible to localize a fermion in a region of space less than half of its compton wavelength ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , if one defines an effective mass as @xmath198 and an effective compton wavelength @xmath199 , one will find@xmath200it follows that the high localization of fermions , related to high values of @xmath167 , never menaces the single - particle interpretation of the dirac theory even if the fermion is massless .",
    "this fact is convincing because the scalar coupling exceeds the vector coupling , and so the conditions for klein s paradox are never reached .",
    "we have assessed the stationary states of a fermion under the influence of a sign potential for a special mixing of scalar and vector couplings . a special unitary transformation allowed to decouple the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor and to assess the scattering problem under a sturm - liouville perspective .",
    "an isolated solution appears when the vector coupling and the scalar coupling have different magnitudes showing that the fermion under a strong potential can be trapped in a highly localized region without the possibility of pair production .",
    "it was also shown that this curious lonely bound - state solution disappears asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the realization of spin and pseudospin symmetries .",

    "<S> the scattering of a fermion in the background of a sign potential is considered with a general mixing of vector and scalar lorentz structures with the scalar coupling stronger than or equal to the vector coupling under the sturm - liouville perspective . </S>",
    "<S> when the vector coupling and the scalar coupling have different magnitudes , an isolated solution shows that the fermion under a strong potential can be trapped in a highly localized region without manifestation of klein s paradox . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the lonely bound - state solution disappears asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the realization of spin and pseudospin symmetries . </S>"
