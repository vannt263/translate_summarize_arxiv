    "vv puppis is considered to be a typical magnetic cataclysmic variable or `` polar '' .",
    "it contains a highly magnetic white dwarf and a late - type secondary star .",
    "vv pup has an orbital period of 100 minutes , and magnetic field strengths of 30.5 mg and 56 mg at the two white dwarf poles . as with all polars ,",
    "vv pup shows large brightness variations of a few magnitudes between what are termed high and low states .",
    "these are times of normal and very low mass transfer respectively for material accreted from the secondary star to the primary white dwarf .",
    "vv pup has been studied in detail in the optical since the mid-1960 s ( walker 1965 ; liebert et al . , 1978 ; schneider & young , 1980 ; cowley et al . , 1982 ;",
    "wickramasinghe et al . ,",
    "1989 ) and at high energy ( x - ray , fuv , and uv : see patterson et al . , 1984 ; vennes et al . , 1995 , imamura et al",
    ", 2000 ; and hoard et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "nearly all studies have occurred during a high state when emission from the accretion stream , the accretion column near the white dwarf magnetic pole , and the accretion region at the pole itself dominate its flux output .",
    "one recent x - ray study of vv pup ( pandel and cordova 2005 ) was performed during a low state . at this time",
    ", it was observed that the mass transfer occurred in an irregular fashion and the x - ray flux from the accretion pole region varied by more than an order of magnitude during orbital phases when the active pole was in view .",
    "these authors concluded that irregular accretion is common in low - state polars , and that such flares are due to  accretion rate fluctuations \" representing strongly varying mass transfer from the companion star .",
    "the flares are likely to result either from capture of coronal mass ejections from the secondary star by the white dwarf s strong magnetic field , or from solar flares near the l1 point .",
    "this indicates stellar activity in the secondary star in polars .",
    "vv pup has been in an extended low state much of the past three years . based on our stochastic monitoring efforts",
    ", the current low state appears to have started near december 2002 and continued througout most of 2005 ( until october or november ) with a brief ( 2 - 3 weeks ? ) volley back to an apparent normal high state in december 2003 . during these past few years",
    ", we have undertaken extensive photometric and spectroscopic studies of vv pup in the optical and ir in order to confidently identify the secondary star and assess its properties and to study the non - accreting white dwarf surface zeeman field and low state cyclotron emission .",
    "results of our optical low state spectroscopy and photometry as well as our magnetic modeling effort are presented elsewhere ( mason , et al . ,",
    "2005 , 2006 ) . here",
    "we concentrate on ir spectroscopy and the secondary star .",
    "we present the first low state , phase - resolved @xmath1-band spectroscopy of vv pup wherein we determine an orbital solution for the binary .",
    "we find the true k@xmath10 , the orbital phase of the secondary star at inferior conjunction , and the spectral type of the secondary star .",
    "we are also able to provide robust mass estimates for m@xmath7 and m@xmath10 .",
    "vv pup was observed during a low state with the nirspec instrument on keck ii under photometric conditions on 17 feb .",
    "table 1 presents a journal of the observations .",
    "nirspec was used in low resolution mode with the slit width set to 0.38 \" .",
    "our grating tilt was chosen to cover the @xmath1-band spectral range of 2.04 to 2.46 microns with a dispersion of 4.27  / pixel .",
    "this setting provided access to secondary star absorption features such as ca , na , and co. we used four minute exposure times throughout and nodded the star along the slit using the standard nirspec 2-nod script , obtaining 22 individual exposures .",
    "observations of bright a0v stars taken nearby in time and location , were used for telluric correction .",
    "we reduced the keck spectra using the idl routine  redspec \" especially developed for nirspec reductions .",
    "redspec averages the two spectra obtained in the `` a '' and `` b '' slit positions , resulting in eleven processed spectra with relative fluxes .",
    "a0v stars are nearly featureless in the @xmath1-band except for a prominent hi brackett line at 2.16 microns .",
    "the redspec software does not attempt to correct for this feature but can interpolate across it thus reducing the impact of the line on the program object spectrum . because a weak telluric feature sits near the brackett line ,",
    "the region very near the 2.16 micron brackett feature is slightly compromised .",
    "figure 1 shows our final summed @xmath1-band keck spectrum of vv pup .",
    "we note it shows what _ appears _ to be a very weak hi brackett emission feature .",
    "we believe that this emission is probably artificial and is caused by the patching - over of the standard star absorption feature during data reduction as noted above .",
    "we can not , however , completely rule out the possibility of residual accretion causing some weak hi brackett emission during this extended low state . while we obtained phase - resolved spectroscopy",
    "( see table 1 ) we noted no significant spectral differences during the single orbit that we observed other than radial velocity changes in the absorption lines .",
    "figure 1 was produced by correcting each of our 11 spectra for the secondary star motion using the radial velocity result below .",
    "the final summed spectrum reveals that the secondary star in vv pup appears to be a normal m7v star ( also see harrison et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "we also observed vv pup using spex on the irtf in `` prism mode '' , from 9:58 to 11:42 ut on 2005 february 7 .",
    "the dispersion in this mode is 34  / pix , and the spectra cover the wavelength range 0.64 to 2.55 @xmath12 m .",
    "the integration times for all exposures were four minutes , and we obtained 20 spectra .",
    "the spectra were reduced using spextool ( vacca et al . 2003 ) . a nearby",
    "a star was used to remove telluric features from these spectra .",
    "figure 2 presents our irtf / spex phase - resolved data for vv pup covering the @xmath13 bands .",
    "each spectrum plotted in this figure is the average of two individual spectra ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the s / n of these data are not high , as vv pup is a challenging target for a 3-m telescope , even at the lowest resolution setting of spex and the  smoothed \" appearance of the data is solely due to its limited spectral resolution .",
    "it is clear , however , that at least one cyclotron hump is present ( near 1.2 @xmath12 m ) , which appears to be the @xmath14 = 3 harmonic from the 30.5 mg pole .",
    "the reality of the features blueward of @xmath150.9 @xmath12 m are somewhat difficult to ascertain .",
    "there are several telluric features in this region , and due to the target faintness , they are difficult to properly remove . in addition , the paschen continuum occurs in this wavelength region ( terminating at 0.82 @xmath12 m ) , as well as the likely contribution of the @xmath14 = 4 harmonic from the 30.5 mg pole ( centered near 0.90 @xmath12 m ) .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath1 bands appear to be completely dominated by photospheric flux from the secondary star during all orbital phases . near phase 0.5 ,",
    "the @xmath2-band spectra is free of cyclotron contributions and appears to be consistent with a normal cool late m - type secondary star .",
    "using our keck phase - resolved spectroscopy we measured the line centers of the na doublet ( 2.2062 & 2.2090 microns ) , the ca triplet ( 2.2614 , 2.2631 & 2.2657 microns ) and the blue edge of the first co band - head ( 2.2935 microns ) .",
    "we fit each of the lines in all eleven spectra ( see table 1 ) after first boxcar smoothing them by 5 to allow robust line fitting .",
    "figure 3 shows an example of one of our keck spectra , the region around the na line , and a smoothed version of this same region .",
    "iraf was used to fit each spectral line of interest ( the co edge was fit by eye ) with a single gaussian profile returning a line center and fitting uncertainty . in most cases ,",
    "the gaussian line fitting determined the line center to one - fifth of the ( binned ) spectral resolution , or @xmath85 .",
    "the line center uncertainties were noted for each measurement and these errors properly propagated through the analysis discussed below .",
    "the co band - head edge fitting was attempted based on some success producing a radial velocity curve with this technique as seen in howell et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for vv pup",
    "these measurements proved to be consistent with , but much less precise than , those described below for the na i lines .",
    "use of the co measurements simply added noise to the final fit of a rv solution so in the end we dropped their use .",
    "likewise , the ca triplet line centers were measured but proved to be chaotic in their velocity determinations .",
    "the cause is due to the redward component of the unresolved triplet changing strength relative to the other two components due to its location on the rapidly falling continuum ( caused by h@xmath10o steam band absorption in the secondary ) and we again dropped these measurements from the final fitting .",
    "measurement of the strong na i doublet produced highly reliable velocity determinations with an essentially constant velocity uncertainty of @xmath150.005 microns ( the resolution element ) , or @xmath1550 km sec@xmath6 .",
    "the use of this doublet was also seen to produce good results for the polar st lmi in howell et al .",
    "the na i doublet is not resolved in our observations and we fit the entire absorption line taking the na i doublet line strength weighted center to be 2.2076 microns .",
    "this line center value will have only a negligible effect on the radial velocity solution values for k@xmath10 or the red - to - blue crossing phase but could effect our measured systemic velocity determination .",
    "we determined the orbital phase of each of the eleven observations listed in table 1 using the photometric ephemeris presented in walker ( 1965 ) .",
    "ephemeris for the time of high state maximum light is @xmath16 and was based on a number of nights of multi - color 1p21 pmt photometric data obtained at the lick 120-inch telescope .",
    "we note here that walker ( 1965 ) lists his ephemeris as jd but calculations using his published tables of data , confirm that it is really hjd .",
    "additionally , the listed ephemeris in diaz & steiner ( 1994 , their eq .",
    "1 ) is incorrect while patterson ( 1984 ) suggests a correction of @xmath150.03 cycles to walker s photometric value due to timing measurements that suggest a small drift has occurred .",
    "while walker ( 1965 ) is a fairly old maximum light photometric ephemeris , it has not only been used by all vv pup investigators to date and , as we will see , it remains highly accurate .",
    "the time of high state optical maximum light ( walker s phase 0.0 ) should be the time when the observer is looking most directly at the active accretion region on the white dwarf . in most polars , the active pole",
    "is thought to be locked near an _",
    "orbital phase _ of @xmath17 = 0.75 @xmath18 0.85 , where phase 0.0 is defined as the secondary star inferior conjunction .",
    "taking our velocity measurements for the na line listed in table 1 and using the orbital phases calculated from the walker photometric ephemeris , we produce the radial velocity curve shown in figure 4 . our best fit sine - curve solution is also plotted and the parameters of this fit are listed in table 3 .",
    "we note that this is the first unambiguous spectroscopic orbital solution for vv pup .",
    "the radial velocity curve shows a _",
    "blue - to - red _ crossing at orbital phase 0.48 placing the _ red - to - blue _ crossing of the secondary star inferior conjunction at orbital phase @xmath190.02 or very near walker s photometric phase 0.0 .",
    "hoard et al . ( 2002 ) also use walker s ephemeris and , based on high state fuv observations , conclude that the inferior conjunction should occur near phase 0.1 .",
    "allen and cherepashchuck ( 1982 ) suggest that true orbital phase zero should occur at walker s phase 0.05@xmath80.03 based on @xmath2-band photometric observations of secondary star ellipsoidal variations made during a low state ( j@xmath1515 ) .",
    "however , we note above ( and will detail in the discussion ) the fact that during a low state , the @xmath2-band flux for vv pup is highly modulated by cyclotron emission . the assignment of low state polar light curve modulations caused by cyclotron emission to ellipsoidal variations has occurred before ( see howell et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "we believe that the allen and cherepashchuck results are such a case and the modulation they observed was entirely due to orbitally modulated @xmath2-band cyclotron emission and not ellipsoidal variations . given the previous work using high state optical emission line decomposition and high energy observations , as well as the time since walker s determination , we take these literature values to agree within the uncertainty of the original ephemeris .",
    "our uncontaminated view of the secondary star provides the best yet determination of the true orbital ephemeris and we use our best fit to to determine a spectroscopic _ red - to - blue _ crossing ephemeris for vv pup of @xmath20 where orbital phase 0.0 is the secondary star inferior conjunction .",
    "our solution has an uncertainty of about @xmath80.01 in phase for the time of zero crossing .",
    "our phase - resolved , low - resolution spectroscopy of vv pup is presented in fig .",
    "2 . the data are fairly noisy due to the extreme faintness of vv pup . for most of the orbit ,",
    "the @xmath0 data are consistent with the spectrum of a late - type star . however , during the orbital phase interval @xmath150.8 to 0.1 , two broad humps , centered near 0.9 and 1.2 @xmath12 m , develop in the @xmath2 band .",
    "these humps are strongest and most easily seen in our phase 0.00 and 0.09 spectra . and are caused by cyclotron radiation from one of the magnetic poles of the white dwarf in vv pup . as described above , the feature at 1.2 @xmath12 m is consistent with the @xmath14 = 3 harmonic from the 30.5 mg pole .",
    "the cyclotron ",
    "continuum \" consists of an optically thick rayleigh - jeans tail at the low harmonics ( long wavelengths ) and a cyclotron hump modulated power law for higher harmonics ( shorter wavelengths ) . as the harmonic number increases ,",
    "the harmonic structure becomes optically thin causing the discernible  cyclotron humps \" that modulate the continuum flux .",
    "the @xmath14 = 2 harmonic from this same pole would be located at 1.78 @xmath12 m , but this region is compromised by telluric water vapor absorption and early cyclotron harmonics are generally optically thick providing only a possible weak continuum contribution ( wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) .",
    "we see no evidence for the @xmath14=2 harmonic in our data .",
    "the development of the 0.90 @xmath12 m ( @xmath14=4 ) feature is quite rapid , and appears in the spectrum at the same time as the 1.2 @xmath12 m feature .",
    "mason et al . , ( 2005 , 2006 ) present high s / n optical spectroscopy of vv pup during this same low state , and their results show unambiguous evidence for the 30.5 mg pole to produce strong cyclotron harmonics ( @xmath14=5,6 ) in the red ( having widths near 800 - 1000  ) which rapidly appear during approximate orbital phases 0.8 through 0.1 and disappear during the remainder of the orbit .",
    "their results are in general accord with ours .",
    "furthermore , mason et al .",
    "note no cyclotron emission from the 56 mg pole , which we do not see as well , revealing that any residual mass accretion during the low state only occurs at the lower strength ( 30.5 mg ) white dwarf magnetic pole that is energetically closer to the secondary star .",
    "the cyclotron harmonics observed in vv pup are weak compared with other low state polars we have observed using spex ( campbell et al .",
    "2005 ; also see harrison et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows a single irtf / spex spectrum of the star eq cet .",
    "eq cet was studied in the optical by schwope et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and assigned a magnetic field strength ( for the active pole ) of b@xmath1545 mg based on the single large cyclotron hump ( @xmath14=4 ) observed in the near - ir . due to this single dominant cyclotron hump",
    "seen in the optical , eq cet was called a larp ( low accretion rate polar ) .",
    "our spex observation shows the presence of three cyclotron humps in the @xmath2-band region that can be assigned to the @xmath14=2,3,4 ( blue hump edges at 1.4 , 0.96 , and 0.73 @xmath12 m ) harmonics of a b=37 mg magnetic field .",
    "thus , the once  exotic \" one hump larp , eq cet , appears to be a normal looking low state polar when observed in the near - ir ; the spectral region for which eq cet s magnetic field strength produces more than one cyclotron feature .",
    "a detailed discussion of our phase - resolved eq cet spectroscopy will be presented in campbell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "ef eri , a polar with a magnetic field strength of b=16 - 21 mg , also shows stronger low state cyclotron humps in the @xmath2-band than does vv pup .",
    "we note that ef eri has a weaker magnetic field strength than vv pup while eq cet is comparable .",
    "cyclotron hump emission strength mainly depends on the electron temperature ( i.e. , @xmath21 m@xmath22 ) , the magnetic field strength ( * b * ) , and the ( instantaneous ) mass accretion rate with lower dependence on which cyclotron harmonic and viewing angle ( lamb and masters 1979 ; wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) .",
    "vv pup is believed to have the most massive white dwarf of the three systems discussed here ( 0.65 m@xmath9 compared with 0.6 m@xmath9 for ef eri and eq cet ) , while its magnetic field strength lies between the other two stars .",
    "how can we account for the relative low state cyclotron emission strengths observed in these three stars ?",
    "considering the differences in white dwarf mass and * b * between these three stars and the fact that pandel and cordova ( 2005 ) determined that vv pup has a low state mass accretion rate of 9.4 @xmath23 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 yr@xmath6 , we can simplistically argue that eq cet must have a low state mass accretion rate of less than or equal to that of vv pup while ef eri s low state m must be nearly twice as high .",
    "schwope et al .",
    "( 1999 ) calculated that eq cet has a low state m of 1.5 @xmath23 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 yr@xmath6 , in agreement with our simple model .",
    "ef eri , on the other hand , seems to have low states where h@xmath24 is present and lower states where no emission is observed and the zeeman split hydrogen absorption lines are observable ( beuermann , et al . , 2000 ;",
    "howell 2004 ) .",
    "additionally , ef eri s x - ray luminosity ( in the lower state ) is 7 @xmath23 10@xmath25 ergs sec@xmath6 , far below the value of 1 @xmath23 10@xmath26 ergs sec@xmath6 observed for vv pup s low state ( pandel and cordova 2005 ) suggesting a very low mass accretion rate .",
    "thus , the level of cyclotron hump strength during a low state may not be a simple proxy allowing an estimate of the mass accretion rate .",
    "these low state mass accretion rates are 23 orders of magnitude below that expected for short - period ( below the period gap ) cataclysmic variables , polars in a high state , and disk accreting dwarf novae .",
    "we note that during what appear to be normal polar low states , the m values agree with the value proposed as the mass accretion rate in a larp .",
    "we note here for interest that the mass loss rate of the sun via the solar wind , is @xmath2710@xmath28 m@xmath9 yr@xmath6 and that of a chromospherically active late - type main sequence star can be @xmath1510@xmath11 m@xmath9 yr@xmath6 .",
    "larps were originally taken to be polars with very low m values during their low states .",
    "a newer definition places them as detached binaries with very cool white dwarfs believed to be pre - polars ( schmidt et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "cyclotron emission in larps is assigned to accretion by the white dwarf of stellar wind material or flaring events on the secondary .",
    "if the same process provides low state cyclotron emission in normal polars , then the secondary stars must be chromospherically active .",
    "this includes the cool ( t@xmath291400k ) , sub - stellar ( 0.045 m@xmath9 ) donor object in ef eri .",
    "our k@xmath10 value , 414 km sec@xmath6 , is the first value directly measured for the secondary star in vv pup .",
    "previous attempts ( see table 4 ) were performed during high states and used the fact that the narrow or sharp component of optical h and he emission lines form on or near the secondary star .",
    "schneider & young ( 1980 ) separately measured the broad and narrow components of hydrogen emission lines and used the narrow component velocities to estimate k@xmath10 .",
    "cowley et al . , ( 1982 ) applied a similar technique , producing a rather complex narrow line radial velocity curve . using new optical spectroscopy ,",
    "diaz and steiner ( 1994 ) applied doppler mapping techniques to estimate k@xmath10 .",
    "these authors realized that due to the location of the formation site of the narrow hydrogen emission line components , near l1 , an inverse k correction ( wade & horne 1988 ) would be needed to convert the observed k@xmath10 value to the true k@xmath10 value for the secondary star center of mass .",
    "diaz and steiner applied this correction ( assuming values for @xmath30 , m@xmath7 , and m@xmath10,where m@xmath10 was taken to be a m4 - 5v star of mass 0.2m@xmath9 ) as well as averaged their value with previous estimates to produce their final best estimate for k@xmath10 .",
    "table 4 summarizes the k@xmath10 history for vv pup .",
    "all of these studies were undertaken in the optical and during a high state and thus none of them detected the secondary star directly .",
    "the narrow component of the optical emission lines are formed near l1 and are highly contaminated by the broader , more variable emission from the accretion stream and column .",
    "additionally , the secondary star spectral type was assumed to be m4 to m5 based on seeing apparent tio bands in the less than ideal low state , low resolution optical spectrum of vv pup presented in liebert et al .",
    "this secondary star type became widely accepted as it generally agreed with the jhk color of vv pup and the spectral type expected based on the ( fallacious ) idea that cataclysmic variables have a  spectral type ( mass ) - roche lobe radius \" relation .",
    "our data eliminate this shortcoming via our direct determination of the secondary star spectral type ( see harrison et al . , 2005 ) and our direct measurement of absorption features from the secondary that provide the proper k@xmath10 .",
    "taking m@xmath10 to be a normal m7v star as discussed above , we can estimate its mass to be 0.08 m@xmath9 ( golimowski et al . , 1995 ; cox 2000 ) .",
    "a spectral type of m8v is ruled out , as shown in harrison et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , by a comparison of the na to co absorption depths : na decreases in depth while co becomes far deeper in later type stars .",
    "it is harder to completely rule out an m6v type ( m = 0.12 m@xmath9 ) for the secondary star in vv pup , while a m5v has far to weak co absorption .",
    "the dynamic mass , spectral type relationship found by kirkpatrick & mccarthy ( 1994 ) places m6.5v as the spectrally defined boundary between normal m dwarfs and brown dwarfs .",
    "spectral types later than this boundary value are confused and may be normal main sequence stars or brown dwarfs ( the latter being objects that are degenerate in temperature , mass , and radius ) . however , only the youngest brown dwarfs appear similar to late m stars and it is unlikely the secondary star in vv pup is young .    a number of researchers have estimated the binary inclination for vv pup .",
    "schneider & young ( 1980 ) use @xmath30=66@xmath31 as a best fit value in order to keep the white dwarf mass within reason .",
    "however , they assumed a 0.2 m@xmath9 secondary , and if their mass function is corrected for our new mass estimate , @xmath30 becomes 76@xmath31 .",
    "cowley et al . (",
    "1982 ) only set a lower limit on k@xmath10 and in order to keep their white dwarf mass near 1.0 m@xmath9 , they were forced to set @xmath30 to 55@xmath31 .",
    "their solution produced a secondary star with a mass of @xmath320.25 m@xmath9 , far to massive to be consistent with our k - band determination .",
    "if we correct their analysis with our low mass secondary , @xmath30 becomes 75 degrees .",
    "using polarimetry , cropper ( 1988 ) measured the system geometry for the white dwarf , solving simultaneously for the location of the magnetic pole and the inclination of the binary system .",
    "he found a value for @xmath30 of 76@xmath86@xmath31 .",
    "sirk & howell ( 1998 ) used euv observations of vv pup during a high state and fit their observations with a 3-d accretion region model .",
    "their best fit binary inclination was 73@xmath82@xmath31 .",
    "finally , vennes et al . ( 1995 ) modeled the white dwarf flux distribution in an euv spectrum and found a best fit by using a corrected cowley et al .",
    "inclination value of @xmath30=76@xmath31 .",
    "taking the cropper and sirk & howell results ( and the consistent value found by correcting the older results for the secondary mass plus the value used by vennes et al . ) , we take the inclination of vv pup s orbit as 75@xmath86@xmath31 .    taking m@xmath10 to be 0.10@xmath80.02 m@xmath9 and m@xmath7=0.65@xmath80.5 m@xmath9 ( vennes et al . , 1995 , pandel & cordova 2005 )",
    ", we find @xmath33 = @xmath34 = 0.15 ( not far from 0.18 found by szkody et al . , 1983 ) and would therefore predict a k@xmath7 of @xmath1564 km sec@xmath6 . taking our @xmath33 value to be correct and solving the mass function for m@xmath7 ( a function with only a weak dependence on @xmath33 )",
    ", we find @xmath35 yields m@xmath7=0.73@xmath80.05m@xmath9 where essentially all of the uncertainty is due to our poor knowledge of the binary inclination .",
    "the value is in agreement with that used in vennes et al . , and in pandel & cordova as well as the mass functions presented in both of the detailed optical spectroscopic studies of schneider & young ( 1980 ) and cowley et al . , ( 1982 ) , if m@xmath10 is taken to be @xmath150.10 m@xmath9 .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "1 shows that during this low state , all of the @xmath1-band flux is due to the secondary star .",
    "bailey ( 1981 ) used his @xmath1-band flux and , well , ",
    "bailey s method \" to determine vv pup s distance while vennes et al . , ( 1995 ) modeled euv observations of the accretion region on the white dwarf .",

    "this distance should be @xmath1 = 15.9 for the secondary star alone .",
    "it is difficult to extract precise photometry from either our keck or irtf data due to the small slits used , but both give @xmath37 15.5 .",
    "szkody & capps ( 1980 ) obtained a photometric value of @xmath1= 15.1@xmath80.2 during the 1978 may low state .",

    "we present the first k - band , low state radial velocity solution for vv pup .",
    "these observations allow , for the first time , a true orbital phasing for the binary to be determined .",
    "we note that during the low state , all the @xmath3 and @xmath1 band flux is from the secondary star and we can use the secondary star s spectral appearance and sodium absorption features in its photosphere to derive mass estimates for both components of the binary . the secondary star in this system seems to have a mass ( m@xmath10=0.10@xmath80.02 m@xmath9 ) and luminosity which are consistent with a normal , late - type m7v star .",
    "we determine a white dwarf mass of m@xmath7=0.73@xmath80.05 m@xmath9 .",
    "normal secondary stars seem to be the rule for polars but the exception for the remainder of the cataclysmic variables ( harrison et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "we also provide an improved orbital ephemeris .",
    "table 5 summarizes our determined parameters for vv pup .    during this low state ,",
    "the cyclotron harmonics in vv pup were very weak , much weaker than in the larp eq cet ( campbell & harrison 2004 ) , or ef eri during its extended ( 8 + year ) low state ( harrison et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "it seems that during low states , the accretion rates in polars can be just as low as those observed for larps ( @xmath1510@xmath11 m@xmath9 yr@xmath6 ) , values in agreement with single , highly active m stars .. our findings suggest that low state polar white dwarfs can remain at a low activity level by accreting material from the secondary star stellar wind and/or flare or star - spot activity .",
    "the tidally locked , spun - up secondaries in cvs should be enhanced in activity and capable of easily providing the needed mass loss levels . for vv pup , low state observations indicate that a stellar wind and/or chromospheric activity is still on - going in a m7v star . for the secondary object in ef eri",
    ", similar processes need to be present even though it is a cool , sub - stellar brown dwarf - like star .",
    "we wish to thank john thorstensen for providing us with his preliminary distance determination of vv pup .",
    "the anonymous referee is also thanked for suggestions and comments that led to a much improved paper .",
