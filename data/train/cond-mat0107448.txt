    "electron - spin - phonon coupling , melting of charge and orbital order , and phase separation which all can be magnetically tunable appear to play an important role in determining the magnitude of the magnetoresistance.@xcite    the magnitude of  mr is path dependent in some of the manganites :  mr is lower when the sample is cooled in zero field ( zfc ) prior to establishing a magnetic field at low temperature than when cooled  in a field ( fc ) from high temperature . only some investigators have payed attention to this aspect.@xcite however",

    "although the charge and antiferromagnetic orderings in laca are generally assumed to occur simultaneously@xcite , our results to be presented latter indicate that charge ordered clusters are present already at 220 k ( i.e. , in the ferromagnetic regions ) even _ while cooling _ from 300 k.    fig .",

    "1(d ) show @xmath0(t , h ) in the zfc and fc modes for prsrca and laca respectively .",

    "below t@xmath7 , the zfc- @xmath0(t , h ) continues to rise and reaches a higher value than the fc- @xmath0(t ) which  either ascends or descends with decreasing t depending upon the field strength .",
    "the temperature dependence of the zfc and fc curves of prsrca and laca are qualitatively similar .",
    "the zfc-@xmath0(t , h ) ) in both compounds mimics the temperature dependence of @xmath0(t , 0 ) curve albeit . at 5 k and at 7 t the resistivity ratio @xmath0(zfc)/@xmath0(fc ) = @xmath9 7.5",

    "thus , from the isofield measurement alone it appears that a single mechanism is responsible for the irreversibility behavior .    in order to understand the origin of the irreversibility in details , we studied the field dependence of the resistivity , and the magnetization . figures 2(a ) and ( b ) show isothermal scans for prsrca and laca respectively at t = 5 k. when h is increased from 0 t to 7 t in the  zero field cooled mode , @xmath0(t = 5 k , h ) of prsrca decreases rather smoothly by almost 3 orders of magnitude and when h is reduced to zero @xmath0(5 k , h ) does not attain the original starting value . upon further cycling  from 0 t@xmath35 -7 t @xmath360 t",

    "the field cooled resistivity at any vlaue of the field is clearly lower than the corresponding zero field cooled value .",
    "the hysteresis loop is open in the positive field cycle with lower resistivity in  h @xmath380 t branch than 0 t @xmath38 h branch . in the zfc mode , @xmath0(5k , h ) of laca",
    "also decreases rather smoothly up to the maximum field of @xmath11h = 7 t. but the field dependence ( see the curvature ) is different from laca .",
    "it also exhibits hysteresis like the prsrca compound but the loop is not closed when h is increased from -5 t to 0 t. . when the sample is field cooled , the hysteresis is negligible compared to prsrca .",
    "figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) compare m(h ) of prsrca and laca respectively . in the zfc mode , m(h ) of prsrca",
    "shows a weak ferromagnetic like behavior for @xmath39h  0.5 t and then increases with a constant slope up to the maximum field of 5 t. the maximum magnetic moment at 5 t in the zfc mode is 0.185 @xmath40 which is only 5.3 % of the maximum moment of 3.5 @xmath40 expected if the whole sample were ferromagnetic  when the sample is field cooled under 5 t , m at 5 t increases to 0.483 @xmath40 which is nearly 2.6 times larger than the corresponding field value in the zfc mode .",
    "the m(h ) loop is symmetric about the origin when the field is cycled between -5 t and + 5 t after the virgin 5 t @xmath380 t curve .",
    "but , the value at  @xmath11h = 5 t decreases to 0.3 @xmath40 when the field is increased from -5 t to + 0.5 t. we have carried out m(h ) under fc mode for @xmath11h = 4 t , and 3 t. since the behaviors are qualitatively the same as 5 t data we do not show them here .",
    "the m(h ) of laca ( fig .",
    "2d ) is in many sense contrasting to prsrca .",
    "the zfc curve exhibits a ferromagnetic like behavior but with a large moment at 0.5 t. the value m at 0.5 t is 0.18 @xmath40 for laca whereas it is only 0.04 @xmath40 for prsrca . at 5 t ,",
    "m of laca is 0.38 @xmath40 which is twice as large as prsrca .",
    "a small hysteresis is seen only in the positive field cycle .",
    "when laca is field cooled under 5 t , m at 5 t increases to 0.85 @xmath41 however , unlike in prsrca , m does not reduce to low value at 5 t after 5 t @xmath380t@xmath385t@xmath385 t cycle .",
    "more importantly we see a large enhancement of  the low field magnetization in laca compared to prsrca .",
    "the spontaneous magnetic moment m@xmath42 = 0.68 @xmath43 ( determined by extrapolating the linear high field part to h = 0 ) decreases with the strength of the cooling field .",
    "the presence of  a ferromagnetic phase below the charge ordering temperature is in agreement with the results inferred from other techniques@xcite and supports the phase separation scenario proposed theroretically.@xcite the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic phase in laca can be calculated from f@xmath44 = m@xmath42/m@xmath45 where m@xmath45 = 3.5 @xmath40 and m@xmath42 is the spontaneous magnetic moment .",
    "the f@xmath46  in laca increases from 4.95 % in  the zfc mode to 19.69 % when  field cooled in 5 t. these are only rough estimates without considering canting of moments in the antiferromagnetic phase . when extrapolated from the recently published data on pr@xmath1sr@xmath47ca@xmath13mno@xmath4 ( x = 0.1 , 0.2)@xcite , the low field behavior m(h ) in our prsrca compound can be ascribed to  few ten nanometer size ferromagnetic clusters ( f@xmath46 0.8 % ) which can behave like a superparamagnetic entity .",
    "these observations underline distinct origins of the path dependent magnetoresistance in these two magnetically identical compounds .",
    "the above presented zero field cooled data in both compounds do not indicate any evidence of a field induced antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic ( metamagnetic ) transition up to 5 t which is otherwise expected . to know",
    "whether we are dealing in the field range far below the critical field for metamagnetic transition , we carried out m(h ) measurement at different temperatures and for higher field values ( @xmath48h 5 t ) in particularly for prsrca .",
    "magnetization up to 12 t for prsrca sample was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer at university of zaragoza , spain .",
    "3 ( a ) shows m(h ) data for prsrca .",
    "the measurements were done in zero field cooled mode .",
    "the m(h ) curve at 210 k is a typical of a long range ferromagnet .",
    "but for lower temperatures , the m(h ) , for example at t = 150 k , initially increases linearly but then jumps abruptly to a higher value around the threshold field h@xmath49 = 4 t and at h h@xmath49 , m(h ) appears to saturate .",
    "the transition is first order as can be guessed from the hysteretic behavior .",
    "the abrupt jump characterize the metamagnetic transition from the antiferromagnetic state to either a spin flop or a spin flip state . for h h@xmath49 ,",
    "the sample is ferromagnetic and for h h@xmath49 , the increase of m(h ) is due to canting of antiferromagnetic moment away form the direction of  the spin axis towards the field direction . the critical field for the metamagnetic transition increases from 4 t at 150 k to 8 t at 75 k and to more than 11 t at 25 k.    we also carried out  m(h ) for laca  but the field was restricted to the maximum available field of 5 t in the squid magnetometer at laboratoire crismat , caen , but  the available field range ( 0 t -5 t ) is sufficient for the purpose of this paper .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . at t = 150 k @xmath50",
    "t@xmath51 , m(h ) behaves like a ferromagnet until @xmath48h = 2 t , but then  increases rapidly above 3.5 t due to the metamagnetic transition .",
    "the metamagnetic transition is not completed at 5 t. at 5 t , the magnetic state can be characterized as a mixture of  magnetic field induced ferromagnetic domains  ( in addition to ferromagnetic phase present in zero field ) and antiferromagnetic domains with canted moments . from the spontaneous magnetization m@xmath52 = 0.6 @xmath53",
    "we calculate the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic phase f@xmath54 = 17.15 % . at 125 k",
    ", f@xmath54 decreases to @xmath9 5.7 % and @xmath9 4.95 % at 5 k. the m(h ) curve of laca at 5 k is more like ferromagnet because the metamagnetic transition takes place at much higher fields .",
    "m(h ) data at  t = 175 k which is above t@xmath6 = 140 k but below t@xmath5 = 230 k also show a metamagnetic transition above @xmath11h = 1 t with hysteresis .",
    "however , the metamagnetic transition is not as sharp at 150 k or as in prsrca compound .",
    "the m(h ) data at 200 k also closely resemble the 175 k but with a very small hysteresis .",
    "we suggest that charge and orbital ordered domains exist above the neel temperature in contrast to the assumption that charge ordering and antiferromagnetic orderings occur simultaneously.@xcite the metamagnetic transition in this temperature range is caused by the field induced destruction of the charge and orbital order .",
    "the delocalization of e@xmath17- carriers enhances ferromagnetic ordering of t@xmath18 spins and so the magnetization increases .",
    "the broad metamagnetic transition suggests that domains of variable sizes are present . some indirect evidence for charge ordering in the ferromagnetic region",
    "can be quoted from the very recent literature : a large positive volume magnetostriction above t@xmath6 in la@xmath1ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 was reported earlier by us@xcite and it was suggested that charge ordered phase of lower unit cell volume coexist with  a ferromagnetic phase of higher unit cell volume in between t@xmath5 and t@xmath6 .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase having higher unit cell volume than the charge ordered phase was recently confirmed by huang et al.@xcite ( see fig . 7 in ref .",
    "10 ) who also found formation of a new structural phase around 220 k in la@xmath1ca@xmath25mno@xmath4 .",
    "the new structural phase is most likely charge and orbital ordered although huang et al.@xcite did not explicitly mention it .",
    "the charge - orbital domains are most likely paramagnetic@xcite in this temperature range since no antiferromagnetic signal was detected in between 220 k and 150 k.@xcite as the temperature is lowered the charge ordered domains grow in size coalesce around t = 140 k below  which @xmath0(t = 0 ) starts to increase rapidly .",
    "a long range antiferromagnetic ordering also takes place around 140 k. a question remains to be unanswered is why the resistivity does not show metallic behavior in between t@xmath5 and t@xmath6 .",
    "a possibility is that charge ordered domains above t@xmath6 but below t@xmath5 are sandwiched between ferromagnetic domains and hence impedes charge transfer between ferromagnetic domains .",
    "however , we can not arrive any definitive conclusion from the present study alone and future work should address this issue .",
    "now we turn our attention again towards the origin of  the field induced irreversibility in resistivity .",
    "the magnetization study suggests that the ferromagnetic phase fraction at 5 k in laca ( f@xmath46 @xmath9 4.5 % ) is larger than in prsrca ( fm @xmath90.8 % ) .",
    "it is likely that the ferromagnetic phase is concentrated in some regions of the sample in laca and is randomly distributed in prsrca .",
    "the difference in the curvature of the virgin zfc -@xmath0(h ) curves below 2 t in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) suggests such a possibility . when the sample is zero field cooled , the magnetization of  the ferromagnetic domains is randomly oriented in laca and as h is increased from 0 t to 2 t , after domain wall motion",
    ", ferromagnetic domains reorient in the field direction .",
    "this causes a rapid decrease of the resistivity in laca in this field range.@xcite the spin canting of the antiferromagnetic sublattices at higher fields ( h 2 t ) can also contributes to the magnetization .",
    "the main source of the magnetoresistance in this field regime in the zero field is tunnelling of the spin polarized carriers between the ferromagnetic domains and between ferromagnetic domains and canted antiferromagnetic phase . in prsrca ,",
    "the dominant contribution to mr in the zero field mode is the canting of antiferromagnetic sublattice .",
    "the zfc behavior of @xmath0(h ) at 5 k in both prca  and laca suggests that metamagnetic transition does not take place up to 7 t. field cooling has two effects .",
    "first , it gives a  preferential orientation of m of ferromagnetic domains which already exist in laca .",
    "second , new ferromagnetic domains are formed at high temperature due to the destruction of the charge ordered domains .",
    "the second contribution is more effective in laca than in prsrca because charge ordered domains of various sizes and hence different critical fields ( h@xmath5 ) are already present above the neel temperature in laca .",
    "this new ferromagnetic phase continues to exist down to the lowest temperature in laca .",
    "hence , the ferromagnetic phase fraction increases with the strength of the cooling field in laca and so , @xmath31 is lowered in the field cooled mode .",
    "if the ferromagnetic domains form a percolating network ( h @xmath55 2 t ) , not necessarily to be a 3 dimensional network but can be filamentary@xcite , then the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is mainly determined by the thermal dependence of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase and so @xmath0(t ) increases with increasing temperature .",
    "there are two possible scenarios in the case of prsrca .",
    "it appears that field cooling does not enhance the ferromagnetic phase fraction in prsrca if one interprets the magnetization data ( fig .",
    "so , the first possibility is that the high field state is metastable with  a majority antiferromagnetic domains with nonzero net magnetisations coexisting with nanometric ferromagnetic clusters . in the double exchange picture@xcite ,",
    "the magnetization due to canting between two neighboring mn@xmath14 and mn@xmath21 sites is m @xmath56m@xmath57  where @xmath58 is the canting angle and m@xmath59 is the saturation magnetization . from the observed value of m = 0.483 @xmath40 at 5 t and at 5 k in the virgin fc curve (",
    "2(c ) ) , we calculate @xmath60  = 82.06@xmath61 between the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattice . which is reduced from @xmath60  = 90@xmath61 in the uncanted scenario .",
    "after field cycling m reduces to 0.2903 @xmath40 , and the canting angle increases to @xmath60  = 85.25@xmath61and in the zero field cooled mode the canting angle is still higher ( @xmath60  = 86.97@xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , the low resistivity in the field cooled mode in prsrca  is due to charge transport through the canted antiferromagnetic domains rather than by the increase of ferromagnetic phase fraction .",
    "another possibility is that field cooling ( h @xmath55 h@xmath5 ) partially destroys the antiferromagnetic and charge ordering and creates  bigger ferromagnetic clusters and antiferromagnetic , charge ordered domains .",
    "the low resistivity in the field cooled mode can be understood as the result of the percolation of the ferromagnetic clusters . when the field is reduced from 5 t ,",
    "the magnetization of ferromagnetic clusters becomes random and hence the spontaneous magnetization is not apparent in the m(h ) curve . from the magnetization measurement alone",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between the above two possibilities .",
    "these subtle differences between these two compounds are also reflected in other measurements . figures .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) compare the @xmath0(t ) behaviors of prsrca and laca , respectively , in the fc ( h)-fw(0 t ) mode .",
    "the samples were first cooled rapidly from 300 k to 5 k in a field h , h was reduced to zero rapidly ( 250 oe / sec ) and data were taken while warming in zero field .",
    "it can be seen that after reducing h from 7 t to 0 t , the value of @xmath0 at 5 k in prsrca is more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than in laca .",
    "this reflects the fact that the field cooled state has a longer relaxation time ( more stable ) in laca than in prsrca which is in agreement with the low field magnetic behavior .",
    "when laca is heated from 5 k , the fc ( 7 t)-fw(0 t ) curve exhibits a maximum at t@xmath63 = 75 k , below this temperature , @xmath0(t ) keeps memory of the low resistive state at 7 t and lost its memory above 75 k. the t@xmath63 shifts down ( t@xmath63 = 75 k , 70 , 64 k for h = 7 t , 4 t and 2 t respectively ) with decreasing h. the fc(7t)-fw(0 t ) curve of prsrca exhibits a broad maximum at a higher temperature t@xmath63 = 111 k and we do not find a clear shift of t@xmath63 with h. in contrast to laca , the fc(2 t)-fw(0 t ) curve does not exhibit a maximum . figures 4(c ) and 4(d ) compare the @xmath0(t ) behavior respectively for prsrca and laca in the fc(7 t)-fw(h ) mode . in the fc(7",
    "t)-fw(h ) mode , the sample was cooled each time from 300 k to 5k at a constant field of h = 7 t , the field was reduced to a h value at 5 k and then @xmath0(t ) in the field ( h ) was measured for different values of h.  so for each set of curves presented , the initial state of the sample at 5 k is the same ,  but a new configuration of domains and/or canted state is reached by reducing the field from 7 t to the prescribed h. the resistivity values at 5 k for diffferent h values remain nearly the same for laca but not for prsrca which shows a factor of 100 increase between the fc(7 t)-fw(7 t ) and the fc(7 t)-fw(1 t ) data .",
    "the fc(7 t)-fw(h ) curve for each h value , except for the fc(7t)-fw(7 t ) curve in laca , shows a maximum at t@xmath63 which shifts down continuously with decreasing h for laca but there is a tendency to shift up below 5 t in prsrca .",
    "in addition , @xmath0(t ) suddenly jumps from a low to high value at the temperature t@xmath64 t@xmath63 .",
    "the jump is sharper in laca , than in prsrca , ( for example see the fw(1 t ) curve ) .",
    "we suggest that the low resistivity below t@xmath64 (= 12 k in laca and 60 k in prsrca for fw(1 t ) ) is caused by the memory of the low resistive state at fc ( 7 t ) .",
    "the downward shift of t@xmath63 in laca can be understood as follows : the ferromagnetic phase fraction decreases with decrease in h and hence percolation occurs at a lower temperature .. however , the dominant effect of reducing h from 7 t in prca is the decrease in the canting angle .",
    "the peak in the fc(7 t)-fc(h ) occurs when the loss of the zeeman energy due to increase in canting angles is compensated by an increase in thermal energy .",
    "presently no standard formula is available to fit these data to extract a quantitative information .",
    "nevertheless , these data indicate that the origins of magnetoresistance in these two compounds are different .",
    "in summary , we have shown that magnetotransport in two magnetically identical compounds la@xmath1ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 ( laca ) and pr@xmath1sr@xmath65ca@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( prsrca ) are strongly path dependent .",
    "field cooling is more effective in lowering the resistivity than zero field cooling .",
    "the isofield temperature scan data are qualitatively similar in both compounds . however , from the isofield temperature scan alone it is impossible to understand the origin of the magnetic history dependent irreversibility in resistivity . from the isothermal magnetic measurements",
    ", we have shown that the dominant effect of field cooling is to increase the ferromagnetic phase fraction in laca whereas it creates metastable canted antiferromagnetic domains and/or ferromagnetic clusters in prsrca .",
    "if laca is cooled under the maximum field of 7 t , and h is reduced to a different value at 5 k , the resistivity value is nearly the same for different values of h at 5 k whereas it increases by two orders of magnitude in prsrca .",
    "the resistivity of laca when warmed in a field after field cooling in @xmath11h = 7 t , shows a monotonic downward shift of the position of the resistivity peak but prsrca shows a different behavior .",
    "these two compounds also exhibit different resistivity behaviors if samples are heated in zero field after field cooling in different h. a quantitative understanding of these results are still lacking . in view of these results",
