    "entanglement purification @xcite is an important protocol which overcomes detrimental effects of noisy channels and generates high fidelity pure entangled states from a large number of not - too - low fidelity states .",
    "the controlled - not gate stays at the core of the protocol and it was experimentally demonstrated earlier than the proposal for the entanglement purification @xcite .",
    "first experimental implementations were done more than a decade ago using photonic qubits @xcite and material qubits @xcite . the purification protocol has found application in the proposals for quantum repeaters @xcite which enables long distance quantum key distribution @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite . the quantum repeater proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite has three sequentially applied building blocks : in the first step an entanglement is generated between neighboring nodes ; in the second step entanglement purification is carried out over the ensemble of low - fidelity entangled pairs ; in the last step the entanglement swapping procedure transforms the entangled states on the neighboring stations into entangled states on the second neighboring stations , thus increasing the distance of shared entanglement .",
    "there is a specific quantum repeater based on hybrid protocols combining continuous and discrete variables @xcite .",
    "we have already discussed two building blocks of a hybrid quantum repeater scheme @xcite based on coherent multiphoton states and resonant matter - field interactions which have advantages in the photonic postselection measurements @xcite . additionally , multiphoton coherent states can be produced with high repetition rates and they have high transmission rates in the channels connecting the quantum nodes . for example , in long distance quantum key distribution scenarios coherent states with both low @xcite and high mean photon numbers @xcite have already been successfully applied .",
    "recently , an entanglement purification scheme has been proposed in the context of the hybrid quantum repeater using chains of atoms , optical cavities and far - off resonant matter - field interactions @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in doing this is due to the long interaction times or large number of photons involved in such a qed scenario .",
    "while single - mode fields with high mean photon numbers are not an experimental issue , the justification of far - off resonant matter - field interactions requires significant difference between the frequency of the material transition and the frequency of the single - mode field and this difference has to be further increased with the increase of the mean photon number in the cavity .    in this paper",
    "we discuss entanglement purification schemes which are based on resonant interactions between flying material qubits and a single - mode cavity field @xcite . at the core of our scheme",
    "is the one - atom maser which has been experimentally investigated over the last few decades @xcite .",
    "our motivation is to augment our previous work with the missing entanglement purification protocol .",
    "thus we require that the chosen scheme , though being not the only possibility to realize an entangling quantum operation @xcite , must be compatible with the architecture of a hybrid quantum repeater based on coherent multiphoton states and resonant matter - field interactions .",
    "we focus on resonant matter - field interactions between material qubits and a single - mode cavity prepared initially in a coherent state .",
    "the two material qubits fly sequentially through the cavity and interact with the single - mode field resulting in a joint quantum state which after a successful postselective balanced homodyne photodection yields an entangling two - qubit quantum operation .",
    "we demonstrate that this probabilistic quantum operation can replace the controlled - not gate in the purification schemes of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in our schemes the qubits do not have to be discarded after inadequate qubit measurement results .",
    "there is a specific bell diagonal state which is generated in hybrid quantum repeaters and thus being a good example of the purification scheme of ref .",
    "we discuss the performance of our proposed purification protocols in this specific scenario .",
    "furthermore , we also investigate the role of the spontaneous decay in the material qubits and the damping of the cavity field mode .",
    "thus we present a truly microscopic model of this qed scenario .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the theoretical model . in sec .",
    "[ entmodel ] we determine the form of the two - qubit quantum operation which is generated by a postselective balanced homodyne photodetection .",

    "[ purify ] to realize entanglement purification . in sec .",
    "[ loss ] we study the role of spontaneous decay and cavity losses and their effect on the purification schemes .",
    "details of the relevant photon states of the unitary model are collected in the appendix .",
    "in this section we discuss a qed model consisting of a single - mode cavity in which two atoms , implementing the material qubits , are injected sequentially such that at most one atom at a time is present inside the cavity .",
    "the field inside the cavity is prepared initially in a coherent state and after both interactions the state of the field gets correlated with the state of the qubits .",
    "this scenario , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , is motivated by the progress in atom - cavity implementations , whereas with the help of cutting - edge technology all the relevant parameters which justify our setup are well under control @xcite .",
    "we present the solution to this model and discuss its properties with the help of the coherent state approximation @xcite .",
    "let us consider two qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 with ground states @xmath2 and excited states @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these qubits pass through a cavity in sequence and interact with a single - mode radiation field which is in resonance with the qubit s transition frequency .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known resonant jaynes - cummings - paul interaction @xcite . due to the resonant condition we are going to work in a time independent interaction picture with respect to the free energy of the cavity and the two qubits . in the dipole and rotating - wave approximation the hamiltonian accounting for the dynamics of qubits and",
    "field is given by ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 we have considered the raising and lowering operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the vacuum rabi splitting @xmath9 for the dipole transition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the destruction ( creation ) operator of the field mode .",
    "we are interested in the situation where there are no initial correlations between the field and the qubits .",
    "therefore , we choose an initial state of the form @xmath12 with the qubits set in an arbitrary state in the basis @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and the field is in a coherent state @xmath15 written in terms of the photon - number states @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and with the phase @xmath18 . as stated before , we are interested in the most simple scenario where the two qubits interact independently and sequentially with the field . therefore , the evolution operator @xmath19 can be written as a product of separate evolution operators and the temporal state vector can be evaluated as @xmath20 where we considered equal interaction times .",
    "solving the state vector is not a complicated task as it is based on the well known solutions of the resonant jaynes - cummings - paul model ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the result is a time dependent quantum state @xmath21 of the tripartite system that can be expressed in the following form @xmath22 where the unnormalized field states @xmath23 are presented in appendix [ app ] .     and",
    "@xmath1 fly sequentially through a cavity and they interact resonantly with a single - mode field .",
    "the field is initially prepared in a coherent state @xmath24 .",
    "after both qubits passed through the cavity , the field state is postselected by a balanced homodyne detection which is depicted as a detector outside the cavity .",
    "provided that we are successful the resulting two - qubit quantum operation is applied in the entanglement purification schemes in sec .",
    "[ purify ] . ]    in order to obtain a better understanding of the field states we concentrate on the case of large mean photon number @xmath25 and interaction times @xmath26 such that the rabi frequency @xmath27 can be linearised around @xmath28 .",
    "this procedure can be justified for short interaction times @xmath26 that fulfill the condition @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to a time scale well below the well - known revival phenomena of the population inversion in the jaynes - cummings - paul model @xcite .",
    "thus one can find that the state of eq .",
    "can be approximated by @xmath30 with the two - qubit unnormalized states @xmath31 which have been written in terms of the bell states @xmath32 one can note that the state in eq . involves only three coherent states : two of them are @xmath33 that rotate with frequencies of opposite sign and a third one @xmath24 which corresponds to the initial coherent sate .",
    "the approximation in eq .",
    "makes evident that a postselective field measurement can be used to prepare an entangled two - qubit state .",
    "of course the simplest non - trivial situation is when the three coherent states are nearly orthogonal . for this purpose",
    "we consider the overlaps between @xmath24 , @xmath34 that yield @xmath35 }    \\approx e^{- \\frac{g^2\\tau^2}{2}}.   \\label{overlap}\\ ] ] the last approximation holds for @xmath36 and shows that the overlap nearly vanishes for interaction times @xmath37 .",
    "it can be shown that the overlap between the other two states vanishes faster in time .",
    "therefore we consider interaction times that fulfill the condition @xmath38 we emphasize that the first inequality is to ensure orthogonal field states , while the second inequality sets a bound in time where the coherent state approximation is valid .",
    "we close this section by pointing out an interesting fact that a similar result to eq .",
    "can be obtained by choosing a setup where the two qubits interact simultaneously with a single - mode field for a time @xmath26 . in our previous works",
    "@xcite we have shown that in the coherent state approximation the two - atom tavis - cummings model results in a solution where the two - qubit state @xmath39 is paired up with @xmath24 .",
    "our subsequent investigation is to determine a field measurement which is capable to realize conditionally an entangling two - qubit quantum operation .",
    "shows that the overlaps between the coherent states approximately vanish for interaction times @xmath40 .",
    "thus a postselective measurement on the field states has the possibility to generate three two - qubit quantum operations which used on the initial state in eq .",
    "result in the states of eqs . and .",
    "however , only the two - qubit state in eq . is a good candidate for an entanglement purification scheme .",
    "the reason is that the states @xmath41 are separable states .",
    "only the state @xmath39 has the potential to be entangled . in order to postselect",
    "the state @xmath39 one has to implement the following quantum operation for any initial two - qubit state @xmath42 @xmath43 the operation is performed by first letting the qubits interact with the field , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "this is described by the evolution @xmath44 , with the evolution operator in eq . .",
    "after the interaction , the state of the field is projected onto the coherent state @xmath24 . by appropriate values of @xmath45 and @xmath26 ( see eq . ) this operation approaches the quantum operation @xmath46 that can be represented as the sum of two projectors on bell states : @xmath47 in particular , its action on the atomic states of the standard basis can be listed as @xmath48 this entanglement generating property of @xmath49 allows us to use it as a bilateral operation in entanglement purification schemes of refs . @xcite and @xcite as we will show in sec .",
    "[ purify ] .",
    "a practical question is how to realize the postselective measurement of the field . in the next subsection",
    "we investigate this issue by means of balanced homodyne photodetection @xcite .          in the following we return to our exact calculations in eq . and show that this quantum operation can be probabilistically implemented with fidelity close to unity by measuring the state of the field with a balanced homodyne photodetection .",
    "first let us study the evolution of the field in phase space with dimensionless coordinates @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we use for this purpose the husimi q - function , defined as @xmath52 where we have introduced the reduced density matrix of the field state @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the partial trace over the qubits .",
    "figure [ fig : qa ] shows the @xmath55 function of the field after the interactions with the two qubits .",
    "the initial field state is characterized by @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 . although the results can be extended to arbitrary values of @xmath18 , for the sake of simplicity here and in the rest of the paper we consider @xmath57 .",
    "it can be noted that the @xmath55 function is composed of three spots , each of which corresponds to a coherent state in eq . .",
    "during the first interaction the initial coherent state splits into two spots that evolve with frequencies of opposite sign .",
    "when qubit @xmath1 interacts with the field emerged after the interaction with qubit @xmath0 , both spots split up again .",
    "due to the fact that the interaction time for both of the qubits is equal , the spots moving backwards meet again at the initial position .",
    "furthermore , the state at the initial position is close to a coherent state while the two other spots are deformed due to the nonlinear dependence of the rabi frequencies on the photon - number .",
    "it is an interesting feature that the initial coherent state is almost restored and this makes the central contribution to the field state an attractive candidate to be measured . provided that we are successful in this measurement",
    "we generate the two - qubit quantum operation in eq . .    in the next step we focus on the postselective field measurement",
    "we briefly recapitulate the basic features which lead to a quadrature measurement of the field with the help of a balanced homodyne measurement @xcite .",
    "the field state , subject to detection , is superposed with a strong local coherent state , i.e. high mean number of photons , at a @xmath58 reflecting beam splitter , and the modes emerging from the beam splitter are measured measured by two photodetectors .",
    "we consider in our scheme ideal photodetectors .",
    "the measured signal is the difference of photon numbers of the two photodetectors . dividing the measured signal by the square root of two times the local coherent state s mean photon number results in a signal , which corresponds to a projective measurement of a quadrature operator @xmath59 on the field state .",
    "the eigenvalue equation of the quadrature @xmath60 reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the phase of the local oscillator .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the annihilation and creation operators of the single - mode field to be measured . here , we assume that the emerged field state in the cavity can be perfectly transferred to this single - mode field . due to the phase space structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qa ] it is reasonable to select the phase of the local oscillator to be @xmath63 , i.e. , the coordinate @xmath64 .",
    "the reason is that the field contribution paired with the two - qubit quantum operation is the farthest from the other field contributions in this particular quadrature measurement .",

    "this ensures that the measurement is selecting only the middle contribution in phase space that corresponds to the coherent state @xmath24 and also the highest probability of postselecting the two - qubit state @xmath39 . in this case",

    "these new protocols discard qubit pairs due to unsuccessful photonic postselection , but in the case of qubit measurements all the unmeasured qubit pairs are kept and only a measurement dependent unitary rotation is performed on them .",
    "we have compared these protocols for initial states which are in a special bell diagonal form and they are generated in the proposals for hybrid quantum repeaters .    finally , we have investigated the role of the losses in our proposed scheme .",
    "we have taken into account the damping rate of the cavity and the spontaneous decay of the qubits .",
    "we have conducted numerical investigations which show that our scheme is sensitive to the cavity damping rate in the sense that high fidelities @xmath223 can be achieved but never unit fidelity .",
    "these numerics were based on parameters taken from real experimental setups .",
    "there is also a trade - off between good and bad cavities because high-@xmath55 cavities enhance the fidelity of the two - qubit quantum operation , but on the other hand the leakage of the field which has to be measured takes a longer time , thus increasing the chance of a spontaneous decay in the qubits . in general",
    ", we have found that protocol ( * ad * ) which does not employ the twirling operation is more efficient than protocol ( * ab * ) by means of the average number of qubit pairs needed for obtaining high fidelity bell states .",

    "this work might offer interesting perspectives .",
    "the results clearly show the limitations of a purification protocol in a hybrid quantum repeater based on multiphoton states , but on the positive side the proposed scheme has a high repetition rate .",
    "the proposed scheme can be already implemented in a one - atom maser setup .",
