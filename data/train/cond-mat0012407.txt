    "after many theoretical and experimental investigations on the high-@xmath5 cuprates @xcite , with a high critical temperature @xmath5 , the symmetry of their order parameter is not yet completely known .",
    "it is now accepted @xcite that the cuprates are quasi - two - dimensional superconductors and at higher temperatures the symmetry of the order parameter is of the @xmath0 type . however , many experiments @xcite and related theoretical studies @xcite suggest that at lower temperatures the order parameter of the cuprates has a mixed symmetry of the @xmath6 type , where @xmath7 represents a minor component with a distinct symmetry superposed on the major component @xmath0 . from theoretical analysis the mixing angle @xmath8 can have the values @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for mixing angles @xmath4 and @xmath12 the time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "four possible candidates for the minor symmetry state @xmath7 are the @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 states . from a group",
    "theoretical point of view these states belong to the same irreducible representation of the orthorhombic point group .",
    "however , there is still controversy about the nature of the minor component and the value of the mixing angle in different high-@xmath5 materials @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a mixed @xmath14 wave symmetry in superconductors was suggested sometime ago by ruckenstein et al .",
    "@xcite and koltiar @xcite .",
    "several phase - sensitive measurements on the order parameter indicate a significant mixing of minor @xmath1-wave component with a major @xmath0 state at lower temperatures in yba@xmath15cu@xmath16o@xmath17 ( ybco ) . in several experimental analysis on the josephson supercurrent for tunneling between a conventional @xmath1-wave superconductor ( pb ) and",
    "twinned or untwinned single crystals of ybco , the possibility of mixed states like @xmath18 or @xmath19 has been conjectured at lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "more recently , kouznetsov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed @xmath20-axis josephson tunneling experiments by depositing a conventional superconductor ( pb ) across the single twin boundary of a ybco crystal and from a study of the critical current under an applied magnetic field they also conjecture a similar mixed state in ybco . from the measurement of the microwave complex conductivity of high quality",

    "_ @xcite also suggested the possibility of @xmath18 or @xmath19 states . in view of this",
    "we perform a theoretical study of this problem using a tight - binding model including orthorhombic distortion and second - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "there is some consensous about @xmath23 mixing in ybco , but in other cuprates one could have a mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath13 components .",
    "however , we shall not study this mixing in this work .",
    "it is pertinent to refer to the studies which led to this conclusion in case of bi@xmath15sr@xmath15cacu@xmath15o@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "although , there is no suitable microscopic theory for high-@xmath5 cuprates , the existence of cooper pair as the charge carrier is usually accepted for these materials .",
    "however , there continues controversy about a proper description of the normal state and the pairing mechanism for such materials .",
    "more recently , for underdoped systems it has not been possible to accomodate the experimentally observed pseudogap @xcite above the superconducting critical temperature in a microscopic theory . however , with the increase of doping the superconducting critical temperature increases and the pseudo gap is reduced and eventually it disappears at optimal doping .",
    "it is generally accepted that in high-@xmath5 cuprates , superconductivity resides mainly in the cuo@xmath15 planes with nearly tetragonal symmetry .",
    "consequently , the critical temperature and superconducting gap of high-@xmath5 materials are expected to be very sensitive to the level of doping which determines the number of conduction electrons in the two - dimensional cuo@xmath15 plane of the cuprates and it is interesting to study the effect of doping or filling on the superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "the present single - band model can acomodate a maximum filling of two electrons ( spin up and down ) per unit cell .",
    "in addition , the experimental observation of a large anisotropy in the penetration depth between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions @xcite in ybco suggests an orthorhombic distortion in ybco and the present study is extended to include such a distortion .    in the absence of a microscopic theory",
    ", we use a phenomenological two - dimensional tight - binding model with appropriate lattice symmetry for studying some of the general features of the mixed - symmetry states involving @xmath27 and different @xmath1 states .",
    "this model has been used successfully in describing many properties of high-@xmath5 materials @xcite . both orthorhombicity and filling",
    "are expected to play a crucial role in the evolution of these mixed - symmetry states and we study in this paper the properties of these states for different temperature , filling , orthorhombicity , and second - neighbor hopping .    in sec .",

    "the present tight - binding model is sufficiently general for considering mixed angular momentum states on tetragonal and orthorhombic lattice , employing nearest and second - nearest - neighbor hopping integrals .",
    "here we take the effective interaction @xmath28 for transition from a momentum @xmath29 to @xmath30 to be separable , and is expanded in terms of some general basis functions @xmath31 , labeled by index @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 the separable nature of the interaction facilitates the solution of the gap equation .",
    "the orthogonal functions @xmath34 are associated with a one - dimensional irreducible representation of the point group of square lattice @xmath35 and are appropriate generalizations of the circular harmonics incorporating the proper lattice symmetry . here",
    "@xmath36 is the coupling of effective interaction in the specific angular momentum state . in the present investigation",
    "we consider predominant singlet cooper pairing and subsequent condensation in the @xmath37 and @xmath1 states , denoted by indices 1 and 2 , respectively , and the mixed - symmetry state formed by these two .",
    "the first function @xmath38 corresponding to the @xmath0 state is given by @xmath39 whereas the second function could be one of the following @xmath1 states @xmath40 etc . here",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to square lattice and @xmath42 represents orthorhombic distortion .",
    "the orthogonality property of functions @xmath43 s is taken to be @xmath44 property ( [ 2 ] ) is approximate for choice ( [ c3 ] ) for @xmath45 .",

    "the quasiparticle dispersion relation relating the electronic energy @xmath46 and momentum @xmath47 is taken as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals along the in - plane @xmath25 and @xmath26 axes , respectively , and @xmath51 is the second - nearest - neighbor hopping integral . in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) @xmath52 is the chemical potential measured with respect to the fermi energy and is determined once the filling @xmath53 is specified .",

    "the potential @xmath28 above also possesses such a symmetry - breaking term .",
    "the energy @xmath46 is measured with respect to the fermi surface .",
    "such a one - band model with different first - neighbor - hopping parameters in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions is the simplest approximate way of including in the theoretical description the effect of orthorhombicity .    at a finite temperature @xmath56",

    "it has been observed that the critical temperature @xmath5 is sensitive to the level of doping which determines the number of available conduction electrons in the cuo@xmath15 plane . in this model",

    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) into their real and imaginary parts . in this case",
    "( [ 12 ] ) is not valid , and the above procedure results in four equations for the two unknowns @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "these four equations are consistent only if @xmath83 or @xmath84 , which means that there could not be mixing between the two components .",
    "so mixed - symmetry states are allowed only for mixing angles @xmath85 and @xmath12 , or for @xmath86 and @xmath87 and we shall consider only these cases in the following .",
    "the ultraviolet momentum - space divergence of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer equation was originally neutralized by a physically - motivated debye cut off @xcite .",
    "this procedure had the advantage of reproducing the experimentally observed isotope effect .",
    "it can also be handled by using the technique of renormalization @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a cut off in the momentum sums of the gap equation .",
    "as there is no pronounced isotope effect in the high-@xmath5 cuprates , the present cut off is merely a mathematical one without any reference to the phonon - induced debye cut off . in eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) both the interactions @xmath88 and @xmath89 are assumed to be energy - independent constants for @xmath90 and zero for @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the present cut off .",

    "this gives us the opportunity to study the mixed - symmetry states for different filling and temperature on both tetragonal and orthorhombic lattice . throughout the present study we consider the cut off @xmath93 with the parameter @xmath94 ev",
    "this corresponds to a cut - off of @xmath95 k. the order parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 presented in this work are all in units of @xmath49 .",
    "we study the mixture of the @xmath0 and the symmetric @xmath1 state (= 1 ) on tetragonal and orthorhombic lattice with second - nearest - neighbor hopping contribution .",
