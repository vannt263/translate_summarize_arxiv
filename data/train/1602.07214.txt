    "recently , the atlas and cms collaborations reported some excess around 750 gev in the observation of the diphoton invariant mass spectrum from the run - ii data at 13 tev  @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , this could be a new particle @xmath1 with spin-0 or -2 and zero electric charge .",
    "these data also indicate that @xmath2 fb can explain the excess of diphoton events . therefore , @xmath1 should have sizable interaction with charged particles in order to have a sufficiently large branching fraction in the diphoton mode .",
    "it implies that we have to improve the standard model ( sm ) by adding two types of particles at least : @xmath1 , and a new charged particle that interacts with @xmath1 , and producing @xmath3 through one loop diagram . along this line of thought ,",
    "a large number of papers have recently been published ; see refs.@xcite .",
    "another motivation for going beyond the sm ( bsm ) comes from nonzero neutrino masses and mixings as well as nonbaryonic cold dark martter , for which there are a huge number of different models . for neutrino masses and mixings , radiative seesaw models are renowned as having an elegant mechanism to explain tiny neutrino masses within renormalizable theories",
    ". some kinds of radiative neutrino mass models have new charged particles that are naturally introduced as a mediating particles in the loops responsible for neutrino masses and mixings",
    ". moreover some of the radiative neutrino mass models can accommodate dark matter ( dm ) candidates , which would clearly be an advantage , since one can explain both neutrino masses and mixings and nonbaryonic dm in one framework . in this paper , we propose a new radiative seesaw model with a local dark @xmath0 symmetry , where neutrino masses and mixings are generated at the three - loop level , and dm candidates are introduced naturally in the model .",
    "then we also explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment , the relic density of our two dm candidates ( majorana fermion and/or scalar ) , as well as the recent 750 gev diphoton excess .",
    "notice here that any lepton flavor violating processes can easily be evaded by diagonalizing the yukawa term that induces the muon anomalous magnetic moment , since our neutrino masses have another yukawa coupling ( @xmath4 ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag - flavor ] ) below ) .",
    "therefore , the neutrino mixing is expected to be generated via @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "since both of the dm candidates have the local dark @xmath7 charge , they interact with the dark neutral vector boson @xmath8 , which plays an important role in the dm thermal relic density in this paper .",
    "and we can easily evade the constraint for a dm direct detection search such as lux  @xcite , assuming that the kinetic mixing between @xmath9 and the sm u(1)@xmath10 gauge field is small enough .",
    "moreover , since our model generalizes the hypercharge of isospin doublet fields as well as isospin singlet fields without violating the structure of neutrinos , a lot of nonzero electric charged fields can be involved in our theory .",
    "thus , we can explain the diphoton excess naturally , depending on the hypercharge quantum numbers of new particles .",
    "however , in general , allowing such a general range in hypercharge number could cause a problem of stable charged particles . therefore",
    ", we have to make them decay into the sm ( or dm ) appropriately . in order to realize this",
    ", we add some more nonzero charged bosons and show the appropriate decay processes for each value of hypercharge , retaining our model .",
    "then such new bosons shall also play a role in contributing the diphoton excess .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define our model for three - loop neutrino masses and dm , the mass matrices for the neutral scalar bosons and neutral fermions including the dm candidates , and the decay properties of exotic particles . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the lepton flavor physics , focusing on the radiative generation of neutrino masses at three - loops , the muon @xmath11 within our model , and charged lepton flavor violation . in our model there are two candidates for cold dm , one bosonic and the other fermionic . in sec .",
    "iv , the phenomenology of these two dm candidates is discussed . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the 750 gev diphoton excess within this model in detail . finally we summarize the results in sec .",
    ".contents of fermion and scalar fields and their charge assignments under @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is an arbitrary odd number .",
    "note that we have introduced three generations of new fermions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whereas only one set of the listed scalar contents are introduced in the scalar sector . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section , we explain our model for three - loop neutrino masses with new particles that are charged under a dark @xmath7 symmetry as well as the sm @xmath17 gauge symmetry .",
    "the particle contents and their gauge charges are shown in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "let us note that all the new particles are color - singlets . to the sm , we have added vector - like exotic isospin doublet fermions @xmath15 with a weak hypercharge equal to @xmath18 , sm singlet dirac fermions @xmath16 , an isospin doublet boson @xmath19 with @xmath20 , an isospin singlet scalar @xmath21 with electric charge @xmath22 , and two isospin singlet neutral scalars @xmath23 and @xmath24 that carry different @xmath7 charges .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is spontaneously broken by the nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a @xmath7-charged sm singlet scalar @xmath25 .",

    ".    then the renormalizable parts of the relevant yukawa interaction lagrangian and the scalar potential under these gauge symmetries are given by @xmath31 where we take @xmath32 in the diagonal basis without loss of generality .",
    "we assume that only the sm higgs doublet @xmath33 and the @xmath7-charged sm singlet scalar@xmath24 have nonzero vevs , which are denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "and we obtain the majorana masses @xmath36 .",
    "the first term of @xmath37 generates the sm charged - lepton masses @xmath38 after the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry by @xmath39 .",
    "we work in the basis where all the coefficients are real and positive for simplicity . in the unitary gauges",

    "and there exists a remnant @xmath42 symmetry ( @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( ii.1 ) ) from the @xmath44-term even after the spontaneous breaking of dark @xmath7 symmetry via @xmath45 , which plays a role in assuring the stability of the dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dark matter candidate in our model is the lightest mass eigenstate of the dirac neutral fermion @xmath46 and/or the lightest isospin singlet boson of @xmath47 .",
    "here we identify the first generation of the mass eigenstate of @xmath48 or @xmath49 as a dark matter candidate .",
    "in addition , we have a massive @xmath8 boson which is associated with @xmath7 after the symmetry breaking .",
    "the mass matrix for the cp - even neutral scalar higgs bosons is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then , the mass eigenstates are defined by @xmath53 where the scalar mixing angle @xmath54 satisfies the following relation : @xmath55 here @xmath56 and @xmath1 denote the sm higgs and the heavier new cp - even higgs , respectively . will be identified as the scalar boson that is responsible for the 750 gev diphoton execss . ]",
    "then the mass eigenvalues are @xmath57 the mass of @xmath8 is also given by @xmath58 where we have ignored the @xmath59-@xmath8 mixing effect , assuming kinetic mixing is negligibly small . the gluon fusion process of @xmath1 production is induced by mixing with sm higgs where we focus on the yukawa interactions of @xmath1 and the top quark as @xmath60    the isospin singlet exotic neutral fermion mass matrix is given by @xmath61 where we define @xmath36 . in general , the diagonalization is very complicated because @xmath62 is the general 3@xmath63 matrix .",
    "however , once we take @xmath62 as the diagonal basis similar to the @xmath64 terms , we can simplify this sector and consider one flavor basis .",
    "hereafter , we adapt this assumption for simplicity . then the mass eigenstates @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined by the following transformation : @xmath67 where we define @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the mass eigenvalues ( @xmath70 ) and the mixing angle @xmath71 are , respectively , given by @xmath72 furthermore , we define @xmath73 and @xmath74 for convenience .",
    "so we rewrite our lagrangian in terms of @xmath75 , where the transformation rules are given by @xmath76 where the mass eigenstate is the same as that of @xmath77 .",
    "now we consider the decay processes for the newly introduced exotic particles .",
    "regardless of the electric charge @xmath78 , the particle @xmath79 always decays into @xmath80 and the charged gauged boson @xmath81 .",
    "and @xmath80 decays into @xmath82 and active neutrinos if @xmath80 is heavier than @xmath82 , or @xmath82 decays into @xmath80 and active neutrinos if @xmath80 is lighter than @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , @xmath83 can decay into @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( with the missing @xmath86 generated by @xmath87 or @xmath88 ) , depending on the mass hierarchies among the particles involved . in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we just assume @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , all we have to find to take care of the decay is how to make the @xmath21 or @xmath90 decay into the sm particles , which depends on the quantum number @xmath16 .",

    "<S> we propose a new type of radiative neutrino model with a local dark @xmath0 symmetry where neutrino masses are induced at the three - loop level , and discuss the muon anomalous magnetic moment , and dark matter candidates therein . by allowing the hypercharges larger than 3/2 for new fields that contribute to the neutrino masses and making them decay into the standard model fields appropriately , we introduce a lot of new particles with multiple electrical charges in a natural manner . as a by - product </S>",
    "<S> , we can accommodate the 750 gev diphoton excess depending on the hypercharge quantum numbers of new fields responsible for the neutrino masses at the three - loop level .    </S>",
