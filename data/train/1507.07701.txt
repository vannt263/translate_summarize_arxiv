    "the ordinary textbook formulation of quantum mechanics is very abstract .",
    "its starting point : the state of a physical system is a normalized vector in a separable hilbert space has lead to an extremely rich theory , a theory which has not been refuted by any experiment and whose predictions range over an extremely wide varity of situations . nevertheless , it is still unclear how this state concept should be interpreted .",
    "many conferences on quantum foundation have been arranged in recent years , but this has only implied that the number of new interpretations have increased , and no one of the old have died out . in two of these conferences , a poll among the participants was carried out [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "the result was an astonishing disagreement on several simple and fundamental questions .",
    "one of these questions was whether quantum theory should be interpreted as an objective theory of the world ( the ontological interpretation ) or if it only expresses our knowledge of the world ( the epistemic interpretation ) .",
    "according to webster s unabridged dictionary , the adjective epistemic means of or pertaining to knowledge , or the conditions for acquiring it.    in spekkens [ 3 ] a toy model was developed , a toy model which can be taken as a strong argument in favour of an epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "partly based on this and partly on other basic premises , fuchs [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] and others have argued for various versions of quantum bayesianism , a radical interpretation where the subjective observer plays an important part .",
    "see also the philosophical discussion by timpson [ 7 ] and the popular account in [ 8 ] .",
    "the present paper takes as a point of departure that in some sense or other the epistemic interpretation should be important for the fundametal issues of the quantum world . the next question then arises : can one find a new and more intuitive _ foundation _ of quantum theory , a foundation related to the epistemic interpretation ?",
    "it is my view that such a foundation must have some relation to statistical inference theory , another scientific fundament , which gives tools for wide variety of empirical investigations , and which in its very essence is epistemic .",
    "it should also be a kind of decision theory , related to decisions taken in everyday life .",
    "every epistemic question together with an answer to this question imply at least two decisions : first a decision to focus in the selection of the question to ask",
    ". then data are collected , and one ends up with a decision on which answer to the focused question one should give from these data .",
    "this last decision is covered by traditional decision theory , but one needs to pay more attention to the process of focusing .    a very tentative answer to the question on foundation given above , is then yes , but there is still more work to be done before such a foundation can be completely established . in [ 9 ]",
    "i will aim to carry out the arguments in more detail .",
    "the quantum bayesianism is founded on an observer s belief , quantified by a bayesian probability .",
    "i want to relate my state concept to the notion of _ certain _ belief , which i call knowledge",
    ". the knowledge will be associated with an agent or with a group of communicating agents , and his / her / their knowledge will be knowledge about what i will call an e - variable .",
    "an epistemic process is any process under which an agent or a group of communicating agents obtain knowledge about a physical system .",
    "in general there are many ways by which one can obtain knowledge about the world or about aspects of the world . in a given situation",
    "the observer has some background , in terms of his history , in terms of his physical environment , and in terms of the concepts that he is able to use in analyzing the situation .",
    "all this may limit his ability to obtain knowledge .    a _",
    "conceptual variable _ is any variable related to the physical system , defined by an agent or by a group of communicating agents .",
    "the variable may be a scalar , a vector or belong to a larger space .",
    "an _ e - variable _ or epistemic conceptual variable @xmath0 is a conceptual variable associated with an epistemic process : before the process the agent ( or agents ) has ( have ) no knowledge about @xmath0 ; after the process he / they has / have some knowledge , in the simplest case full knowledge : @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is one of the possible values that @xmath0 can take . in this paper",
    "it is mostly assumed for simplicity that @xmath0 is discrete , which it will be in the elementary quantum setting below . for a continuous variable @xmath0 , knowledge on the e - variable",
    "will be taken to mean a statement to the effect that @xmath0 belongs to some given set , an interval if @xmath0 is a scalar .",
    "the e - variable concept is a generalization of the parameter concept as used in statistical inference , introduced by fisher [ 10 ] , and today incorporated in nearly all applications of statistics . in statistics ,",
    "a parameter @xmath0 is usually an index in the statistical model for the observations , and the purpose of an empirical investigation is to obtain statements about @xmath0 , in terms of point estimation , confidence interval estimation or conclusion from the testing of hypotheses .",
    "the parameter is often associated with a hypothetical infinite population .",
    "my e - variable will also be allowed to be associated with a finite physical system , a particle or a set of particles .",
    "but , in the same way as with a parameter , the purpose of any empirical investigation will be to try to conclude with some statement , a statement expressed in terms of an e - variable @xmath0 .",
    "it is important that not all conceptual variables are e - variables .",
    "a conceptual variable @xmath3 is called _ inaccessible _ if there is no epistemic process by which one can get accurate knowledge about it .",
    "an example from the area of quantum mechanics is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the position of a particle , and @xmath6 is the momentum .",
    "also macroscopic examples abound , for instance connected to counterfactual situations [ 9 ] .",
    "another physical example is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the component of an angular momentum or a spin for a particle or a system of particles , the component in direction @xmath9 .",
    "here each @xmath8 is an accessible conceptual variable , an e - variable , but the vector @xmath3 is inaccessible .    in such cases , where a vector of e - variables is inaccessible ,",
    "it is equivalent to say that the components are complementary . since introduced by bohr",
    ", the concept of complementarity has played a fundamental and important role in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is essential to stress that the inaccessible conceptual variables above are not hidden variables .",
    "variables like @xmath3 are just mathematical variables , but variables upon which group actions may be defined .",
    "@xmath4 may be subject to galilean transformations , time translations or changes of units , while @xmath7 may be subject to rotations .",
    "this will of course also induce transformation of the components , the e - variables .",
    "important transformations in the group of rotations of @xmath3 are : 1 ) those leading to the change in the values of @xmath10 ( or of any other fixed component ) ; 2 ) those leading to an exchange of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( or any other pair of components ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to indicate how one can derive the essence of the quantum formalism from reasonable assumptions in a setting which generalizes the angular momentum setting described above .",
    "let in general @xmath3 be an inaccessible conceptual variable taking values in some measurable space @xmath12 , and let @xmath13 be accessible functions for @xmath9 belonging to some index set @xmath14 .",
    "i will repeat that a conceptual variable is accessible if it in the given context can be estimated with arbitrary accuracy by _ some _ experiment .",
    "technically i will without further mention assume that all functions defined on @xmath15 are measurable . to begin with",
    ", i will assume that the functions @xmath8 are maximal , and also that they can be transformed into each other by an automorphism in @xmath15 .",

    "also , @xmath3 is an upper bound under this partial ordering .",
    "the existence of maximal accessible conceptual variables follows then from zorn s lemma .    for the angular momentum case",
    ", the transformation @xmath21 means exchange of the component @xmath8 and the component @xmath26 . in this process",
    ", one can imagine that the vector @xmath3 is decomposed as @xmath27 , where the axis @xmath28 is orthogonal to the @xmath29-plane , and @xmath21 then changes the sign of @xmath30 , moving along a great circle .",
    "below , i will often single out a particular index @xmath31 . then a ) , given b ) , can be formally weakened to the assumption that @xmath32 is maximally accessible , and b ) can be weakened to the existence for all @xmath9 of an invertible transformation @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",
    "take @xmath35 .    even though @xmath3 is inaccessible , it is possible to operate on @xmath3 with functions , in particular group actions .",
    "the group of automorphisms on @xmath15 , all transformations of elements @xmath3 , always exists from a mathematical point of view , and one can imagine many subgroups of this group . some of these will now be defined .",

    "the dutch book principle states : for a rational actor , no choice of payoffs in a series of bets shall lead to sure loss for the bettor . thus in this approach , born s formula , which is formulated as an independent axiom in most texbooks , can be seen to follow from quite intuitive assumptions .    in [ 9 ] also",
    "the quantum mechanics for position and momentum is discussed .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath195 for one - dimensional position is shown to follow from 1 ) position as an inaccessible stochastic process ; 2 ) conditioning both on past events and on future events ; 3 ) elements from nelson s stochastic mechanics .    epr and violation of bell s inequality for simple epistemic states can be given interesting interpretations .",
    "the conditionality principle from statistics states : when doing a coin toss to choose an experiment , an observer should condition upon the value of the coin toss .",
    "imagine that this principle is used both for alice and for bob .",
    "this implies that their observations are interpreted as some sort of experiment .",
    "that is , observation means inference : decision on what has been observed . under this condition",
    "the epr paradox turns out to be no paradox any more , and the violation of bell s inequality can be simply explained .",
    "the assumption of _ realism _ is violated by this version of quantum mechanics ; the assumption of locality is not violated .",
    "it is well known from the quantum bayesian literature that the so - called paradox of wigner s friend is no paradox any more with an epistemic interpretation of the state vector .",
    "despite its enormous success , there is still no consensus among physicists about what quantum theory is saying about the nature of reality . in my view",
    ", its foundation should be related to the process of obtaining knowledge about the world .",
    "it seems to be possible to formalize this in a precise mathematical way .    in this theory",
    "something resembling the formal state definition of traditional quantum mechanics is derived from a simpler and more natural conceptual basis .",
    "this derivation is done under certain technical assumptions .",
    "the use of group theory seems to be essential .",
    "it also seems to be important that the approach here and in [ 9 ] uses ideas both from the quantum mechanical tradition and from the statistical tradition . in the long run",
    "one might perhaps hope for some sort of synthesis in the foundation of the two sciences .",
    "since space is limited here , i prepare an extended version [ 16 ] , where i will discuss the validity of theorem 1 for the spin / angular momentum case , and where the relation to other approaches towards the foundation of quantum mechanics and to the interpretation of quantum mechanics will be discussed .",
