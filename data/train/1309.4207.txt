    "in recent years the casimir effect @xcite has been a subject of extremely active consideration .",
    "experimental @xcite , and theoretical results @xcite deal with the attractive and repulsive casimir force , with the casimir force between separated bodies ( including anisotropic atoms ) and the casimir effect for one isolated body , casimir effect for various topology , geometry , type of boundary condition and curvature of surfaces . for the purposes of construction of nanomechanical devices",
    "there are two the most important aspects of the casimir effect .",
    "the first aspect is the positive sign of energy ( repulsion @xcite ) without intermediate dielectric fluid , and the second one is the value of tangential force .",
    "we will concentrate on the second task .     ",
    "period , @xmath0  length of first profile edge , @xmath1  length of second profile edge , @xmath2  shift , @xmath3  width of the gap . ]    in this paper we consider the effect of slope for the rack gear . for the sake of simplicity we study the case of scalar field ,",
    "so one numerical calculation permits us to obtain results for both two - dimensional and three dimensional geometry .",
    "the standard rack gear consists of two profiled plates with identical period @xmath4 .",
    "we assume , that the plates are parallel , whereas the surface of profiles has a slope ( see fig 1 . for geometry details and parameters ) .",
    "three - dimensional model implies additional dimension @xmath5 , orthogonal to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with the translational invariance along @xmath5 axis .",
    "we assume the simplest zero boundary condition on the plate surface . we start with the zero slope ( @xmath0=@xmath1 ) , and study the dependence of both normal and tangential casimir forces on the parameter @xmath1 for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is obvious , that both forces will decrease for decreasing @xmath1 ( increasing slope ) , due to the enlargement of average distance between plates .",
    "but the type of the dependence for normal and tangential forces can be different .",
    "indeed , the density of normal force ( normal force per unit length along the @xmath7 axis for two - dimensional case and normal force corresponding to unit area at @xmath8 plane for three - dimensional case ) depends essentially on the distance between plates for all @xmath7 positions . at the same time the tangential force is nt equal to zero only when this distance is not constant ,",
    "so for rack gear it is mostly side effect . for the geometry",
    "assumed the distance between profile edges with the length @xmath0 remains unchanged ( it is equal to @xmath3 ) , so the effect of slope for tangential force should be less significant , then for normal force .",
    "we perform the direct numerical calculations to verify all these speculations .",
    "as is well known , the simplest method to estimate the casimir force between two isolated bodies for the scalar field is to calculate numerically the euclidian green function for the surface conditions imposed @xcite .",
    "so we ll find the solution to the equation @xmath9 with the boundary condition @xmath10 where @xmath11 lies on the plate surface .",
    "for any point @xmath12 between plates the vacuum expectation value of energy - momentum tensor density can be calculated as @xmath13 @xmath14    @xmath15    for two - dimensional case . here",
    "@xmath16 is the mass of the scalar field .",
    "both expressions appears to be singular at @xmath17 and should be renormalized . for two distant bodies the renormalization procedure is quite trivial",
    " it is sufficient to subtract the same expression for minkowski space .",
    "the expression for three - dimensional case is almost identical due to translational invariance along @xmath5 axis .",
    "one can perform fourier transformation along @xmath5 axis and obtain two - dimensional task for each fourier component .",
    "so the three - dimensional expressions take the form : @xmath18 @xmath19    @xmath20    finally we should integrate renormalized expressions ( [ n2d])-([t3d ] ) along the @xmath7 axis from point @xmath21 to point @xmath22 , where @xmath21  arbitrary point , that is placed in the gap between plates . for instance , for ( [ n2d ] ) ( two - dimensional case , normal force ) : @xmath23 it is not the force density , but the force for one period ; to obtain the force density one should divide this result by the period length @xmath4 .    to calculate the difference between green function and green function for minkowski space @xmath24 we use a slightly modified boundary - element method @xcite . this difference is equal to the solution of the homogeneous helmholtz equation with the boundary condition @xmath25 , where @xmath11 is positioned on the plate surface . instead of the standard spline approach for the given boundary element we use polynomial approximation , based on surrounding elements .",
    "it is similar , but not precisely equal to spline .",
    "we estimate calculation errors by increasing points density and subsequent comparison of results .",
    "the relative error appears to be about @xmath26 .",
    "we use the natural system of units @xmath27 and choose the arbitrary geometry parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and three values for @xmath31 ( zero slope ) , @xmath32 ( medium slope ) , @xmath33 ( large slope ) .",
    "we should calculate green functions for all @xmath34 values , so we can obtain results for arbitrary mass of the scalar field .",
    "but we restrict ourselves to the massless case @xmath35 . from equations ( [ n2d])-([t3d ] )",
    "one can easily conclude , that the mass dependence ca nt drastically modify results , so the type of dependence should remain unchanged .",
    "direct calculations confirm this assumption .    , dashed line  @xmath32 , dotted line  @xmath33 . ]     for three - dimensional case",
    ". solid line  @xmath31 , dashed line  @xmath32 , dotted line  @xmath33 . ]    from figs . 2 and 3",
    "one can easily find , that the value of normal force essentially decreases for increasing slope for both two- and three - dimensional cases .",
    "this result seems quite reasonable , if we take into account , that we change slope for fixed absolute gap width , whereas average gap width increases .",
    "moreover , this effect appears to be almost homogeneous : for different values of shift @xmath2 we observe almost identical slope dependence .",
    "it also should be noted , that there is no `` phase shift '' in the @xmath2-dependence , i.e. the position of maximum and minimum force values remains almost unchanged , at @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspondingly .    , dashed line  @xmath32 , dotted line  @xmath33 . ]    , dashed line  @xmath32 , dotted line  @xmath33 . ]    on the contrary , for the tangential force ( figs . 4 and 5 ) we observe moderate decrease for increasing slope .",
    "indeed , in two - dimensional case the normal force maximum for large slope ( @xmath33 ) is about 45% of the maximum for zero slope ( @xmath31 ) , whereas the tangential force maximum for large slope is about 85% of the maximum for zero slope . for three - dimensional case",
    "we obtain almost the same behavior , because the expressions for three - dimensional case differ from two - dimensional case only by one additional multiplier in the integral .",
    "it also should be noted , that there is an essential `` phase shift '' in the @xmath2-dependence , i.e. the shift of the position for maximum and minimum force values at various slopes .",
    "for instance , in the case of zero shift ( @xmath36 ) we get nonzero tangential force for nonzero slopes , whereas for the zero slope this force is absent due to obvious symmetry reasons .",
    "for the large slope this `` phase shift '' is almost equal to @xmath38 ( about 40% of the period @xmath4 ) . in some sense the tangential force for the zero shift and nonzero slope is partly `` normal ''  it can be interpreted as the projection of attracting force between parallel sloped surfaces ( this force is orthogonal to the surfaces ) on the @xmath7 axis .",
    "direct numerical computations lead us to the conclusion , that ( at least for the geometry considered ) the slope of profile surfaces can essentially change the value of normal casimir force for the rack gear , whereas tangential force remains almost unchanged , but exhibits essential `` phase shift ''  shift of maximum and minimum positions . both results",
    "are quite reasonable , because normal force is defined mostly by the width of the gap , whereas tangential force depends essentially on the change of this width . for the geometry",
    "considered the derivative of the gap width along @xmath7 axis depends on the slope , but average value of this derivative remains almost unchanged .",
    "it should be mentioned , that we consider the trivial case of zero boundary condition . for",
    "neumann or robin boundary conditions results may change drastically , because green functions at the presence of sharp edges ( for instance , @xmath39 angles between flat surfaces ) essentially depend on the type of boundary condition considered .",
