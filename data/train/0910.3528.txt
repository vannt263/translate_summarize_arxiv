    "jet quenching , i.e.  the energy loss of hard partons created in the first moments of an a - a collision due to interactions with the surrounding soft medium has long been regarded a promising tool to study properties of the soft bulk medium created along with the hard process @xcite . the effect of the medium is apparent from a comparison of high @xmath0 hadron observables measured in a - a collisions with the same observables in p - p collisions .",
    "the current range of such observables includes the suppression in single inclusive hard hadron spectra @xmath1 @xcite , the suppression of back - to - back correlations @xcite and single hadron suppression as a function of the emission angle with the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "recently also preliminary measurements of fully reconstructed jets have become available @xcite .",
    "single hadron observables and back - to - back correlations above 6 gev ( where hadron production is dominated by hard processes ) are well described in detailed model calculations using the concept of energy loss @xcite , i.e. under the assumption that the process can be described by a medium - induced shift of the leading parton energy by an amount @xmath5 where the probability of energy loss is governed by a distribution @xmath6 , followed by a fragmentation process using vacuum fragmentation of a parton with the reduced energy .",
    "this can be cast into the form of a modified fragmentation function ( mmff ) .",
    "if the vacuum fragmentation function , i.e. the distribution of hadrons produced from a parton at fractional momentum @xmath7 given a hadronization scale @xmath8 is @xmath9 , then the mmff given the medium induced energy loss probability @xmath6 can be written as    @xmath10    beyond the leading parton approximation in which energy loss and fragmentation factorize , one has to solve the full partonic shower evolution equations in the medium while assuming that the non - perturbative hadronization takes place outside the medium .",
    "at least for light subleading hadrons in a shower , factorizing hadronization from the medium - modified parton shower is a reasonable assumption at both rhic and lhc kinematics .",
    "there are several calculations which utilize such medium - modified showers analytically @xcite .",
    "recently , also monte carlo ( mc ) codes for in - medium shower evolution have become available @xcite which are based on mc shower simulations developed for hadronic collisions , such as pythia @xcite or herwig @xcite .",
    "these have , unlike current analytical computations , full energy - momentum conservation enforced at each branching vertex . in these calculations",
    "the mmff is obtained directly rather than from an expression like eq .",
    "( [ e - modf ] ) .",
    "so far , the different pictures for the parton - medium interaction have been explored and compared with data over a rather finite kinematical window with @xmath11 gev .",
    "there is a widespread expectation that if the @xmath0 range of the measurement could be extended , either at rhic or at lhc , one would eventually observe the disappearance of the medium effect .",
    "the origin of this expectation is that the medium is able to modify the hard parton kinematics at a typical scale set by its temperature @xmath2 , whereas the parton dynamics takes place at a partonic hard scale @xmath12 , and if @xmath13 the hard kinematics should be esentially unchanged , which can be realized for large hadronic @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in the case of the nuclear suppression factor , this expectation would imply that @xmath14 approaches unity for @xmath4 .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to discuss the physics contained in the shape of @xmath14 and to present what current models , both based on the energy - loss concept and on the in - medium parton shower concept , predict for the shape of @xmath1 at very large momenta at both rhic and lhc .",
    "a qualitative argument why @xmath1 should increase with @xmath0 can be made as follows : parton spectra can be approximated by a power law as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "assume that one can approximate the effect of the medium by the mean value energy loss @xmath17 ( for realistic energy loss models , this is not a good approximation , as fluctuations around the mean turn out to be large ) .",
    "in this case , the energy loss shifts the spectrum .",
    "this can be described by the replacement @xmath18 in the expression for the parton spectrum .",
    "@xmath19 can then be approximated by the ratio of the parton spectra before and after energy loss as    @xmath20    and it is easily seen that this expression approaches unity for @xmath21 . however , it is not readily obvious under what conditions the limit is reached even if the medium properties are known .",
    "parametrically , the medium temperature @xmath2 governs both the medium density and the typical medium momentum scale , but the total energy loss represents the cumulative effect of the medium , i.e. a line integral of medium properties along the path of the partons , and furthermore the physics of medium - induced radiation is rather complicated , interference between different radiation graphs play a significant role , and therefore the mean energy loss is not simply @xmath22 .",
    "thus , in realistic calculation the mean energy loss at rhic conditions is @xmath23 gev even for @xmath24 gev @xcite , and hence it can be understood that current data are relatively far from the limit .",
    "there are five main points which may be raised against the approximation eq .",
    "( [ e - raaapprox1 ] ) :    * the estimate holds for partons and does not take into account fragmentation : + this , however , is not a crucial issue for the question at hand .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath9 is steeply falling with @xmath7 and as a result , fragmentation processes at low @xmath7 are preferred .",
    "however , for given momentum scale of the hadron spectrum , low @xmath7 implies high parton momentum , and this is suppressed because the parton spectrum is also steeply falling with @xmath12 . as a result , there is some typical intermediate @xmath25 ( dependent on hadron and parton type ) which relates hadron and parton momentum , for quarks fragmenting into light hadrons at rhic kinematics @xmath26 .",
    "this means that hadronic @xmath1 is to first approximation simply scaled by this factor as compared to partonic @xmath1",
    ". fluctuations around the average tend to smear out structures in the partonic @xmath1 through the hadronization process , but do not alter the shape of @xmath14 beyond that .",
    "thus , qualitatively eq .",
    "( [ e - raaapprox1 ] ) holds also on the hadronic level .",
    "* the estimate does not distinguish between quarks and gluons : + this is moderately important , as energy loss is expected to be stronger for gluons by a factor 9/4 ( the ratio of the casimir color factors ) . at low @xmath0 , hadron production is driven by gluonic processes as gluons are copiously available in the low @xmath27 region in parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite . however , hadron production at higher @xmath0 probes more and more in the high @xmath27 region in the parton distributions , and eventually valence quark scattering dominates .",
    "the hadronic @xmath1 should therefore show a rise from gluonic @xmath1 to the larger value of quark @xmath1 which corresponds to the transition from gluon to quark - dominated hadroproduction . as shown in @xcite , this is likely to be the mechanism underlying the rising trend observed in @xmath1 at rhic . for asymptotically high energies ,",
    "the mechanism is not relevant however , as this is always a quark dominated regime . *",
    "the estimate neglects fluctuations around the average energy loss : + in the presence of fluctuations , @xmath6 can be written as the sum of three terms , corresponding to transmission witout energy loss , shift of the parton energy by finite energy loss or parton absorption as + @xmath28 + where @xmath29 is a normalized probability distribution such that @xmath30 . inserting this form to average over eq .",
    "( [ e - raaapprox1 ] ) with the proper weights , one finds + @xmath31 + it follows that @xmath1 obtained with this expression is always bounded by @xmath32 from below ( if a fraction of partons escapes unmodified , no amount of modification to the rest will alter this ) and by @xmath33 from above ( if partons are absorbed _ independent of their energy _ , @xmath1 will never approach unity ) . in many calculations ,",
    "@xmath34 is determined by the condition that a parton is absorbed whenever its calculated energy loss exceeds its energy , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 are dependent on the initial parton energy",
    ". in particular , in the asw formalism @xcite , the energy loss can be formally larger than the initial energy , since the formalism is derived for asymptotically high energies @xmath36 and small energy of radiated gluons @xmath37 , but is commonly applied to kinematic situations in which these conditions are not fulfilled .",
    "@xmath1 at given @xmath12 is then equal to the transmission term @xmath32 plus a contribution which is proportional to the integral of @xmath29 from zero up to the energy scale @xmath38 of the parton , _ seen through the filter _ of the steeply falling parton spectrum .",
    "thus , in the presence of fluctuations , @xmath1 is dominated by fluctuations towards the low @xmath5 , and @xmath1 grows with @xmath12 since @xmath38 grows linearly with @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath6 includes fluctuations up to a maximal energy loss @xmath39 , then for @xmath40 the original argument made for constant energy loss applies and @xmath1 aproaches unity . in practice",
    "this may not be observable - the energy loss probability for rhic kinematics may be substantial up to scales of @xmath41 gev @xcite , i.e. of the order of the kinematic limit .",
    "* the pqcd parton spectrum is not a power law : + while in a limited kinematic range , the pqcd parton spectrum is approximated well by a power law , at about @xmath42 the power law fit becomes a bad description of the spectrum .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - power ] .",
    "close to the kinematic limit at @xmath43 , the parton spectrum falls very steeply . if one would attempt a local power law fit in this region , the region of validity for",
    "the fit would be small and @xmath44 very large .",
    "one can readily see from eq .",
    "( [ e - raaapprox1 ] ) that even for @xmath45 @xmath1 does not approach unity when at the same time @xmath46 . in other words , close to the kinematic limit",
    ", even a small @xmath5 causes a massive suppression simply because there are no partons available higher up in the spectrum which could be shifted down .",
    "for this reason , close to the kinematic limit @xmath47 can not be expected , rather ( dependent on the details of modelling ) , something like @xmath48 should be expected .",
    "+ however , note also that the validity of factorization into a hard process and a fragmentation function has been assumed for hadron production up to the kinematic limit . this may not be true , higher twist mechanisms like direct hadron production in the hard subprocess ( in the context of heavy - ion collisions , see e.g. @xcite may represent a different contribution which , due to color transparency , remains unaffected by the medium at all @xmath0 and which may be significantly stronger than fragmentation close to the kinematic limit .",
    "this could be effectively absorbed into a modified coefficient @xmath32 which however ceases to have a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "* the nuclear initial state effects have not been taken into account : + the initial state nuclear effects , i.e. the difference in nucleon @xcite and nuclear @xcite pdfs , are often thought to be a small correction to the final state medium effects . over a large kinematic range , that is quite true .",
    "however , as one approaches the kinematic limit and forces the distributions into the @xmath49 valence quark distributions , one probes the fermi motion region in the nuclear parton distributions where the difference to nucleon pdfs is sizeable .",
    "+ in fig .",

    "the energy loss probability @xmath66 for this path can be obtained by evaluating the line integrals along the eikonal parton path    @xmath67    with the relation    @xmath68    assumed between the local transport coefficient @xmath69 ( specifying the quenching power of the medium ) , the energy density @xmath70 and the local flow rapidity @xmath71 with angle @xmath72 between flow and parton trajectory @xcite .",
    "the medium parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 are obtained from a 2 + 1-d hydrodynamical simulation of bulk matter evolution @xcite , chosen to have the rhic and the lhc medium described within the same framework .",
    "@xmath73 is the characteristic gluon frequency , setting the scale of the energy loss probability distribution , and @xmath74 is a measure of the path - length weighted by the local quenching power . the parameter @xmath75 is seen as a tool to account for the uncertainty in the selection of the strong coupling @xmath76 and possible non - perturbative effects increasing the quenching power of the medium ( see discussion in @xcite ) and adjusted such that pionic @xmath1 for central au - au collisions is described at one value of @xmath0 .    using the numerical results of @xcite and the definitions above , the energy loss probability distribution given a parton trajectory can now be obtained as a function of the initial vertex and direction @xmath77 as @xmath78 for @xmath73 and @xmath79 . from the energy loss distribution given a single path , one can define the averaged energy loss probability distribution @xmath80 as    @xmath81    the energy loss probability @xmath66 is derived in the limit of infinite parton energy @xcite , however in the following the formalism is applied to finite kinematics . in order to account for the finite energy @xmath82 of the partons @xmath83 is truncated at @xmath84 and @xmath85 is added to the truncated distribution to ensure proper normalization .",

    "[ f - raarhic ] and compared with phenix data @xcite . for the asw calculation , the partonic @xmath1 is also indicated separately for quarks and gluons .    before discussing details of the plot , let us recapitulate the main differences between the energy loss picture as exemplified by the asw model and the medium - modified shower picture as represented by yajem :    * asw is derived for infinite parton energy , hence @xmath6 is independent of the initial parton energy and the only energy dependence arises from the prescription to assign contributions where @xmath134 into an absorption term @xmath135 .",

    "is driven by the transition from a gluon - dominated to a quark dominated regime  the asw hadronic result subsequently approaches the quark result for larger momenta .",
    "this transition is also present in yajem , however it is masked by the onset of the low @xmath0 enhancement , which just starts to become significant below 6 gev and corresponds to a decreasing trend of @xmath1 with increasing @xmath0 . as a result , the two opposing effects roughly cancel and the yajem result appears flatter than the asw result between 6 and 25 gev .    for higher @xmath0",
    ", there follows a region up to 50 gev in which both the asw and the yajem result descrease slightly .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that the pqcd spectrum is not a power law , and that local power law fits result in increasing @xmath44 for higher @xmath12 .",
    "the two curves run in parallel till @xmath136 gev , then the predictions of the two models are strikingly different .",
    "the asw curve turns upward beyond @xmath137 gev . a comparison with fig .",
    "[ f - npdf ] shows that this has nothing to do with the final state energy loss , but reflects the fermi motion region in the nuclear pdfs . at the kinematic boundary ,",

    "note that the yajem result can not be computed all the way to the kinematic limit due to lack of statistics in the mc results at @xmath105 .",
    "it is also clear that there is no region throughout the whole kinematic range at rhic in either model for which @xmath47 could be observed .",
    "it is then natural to expect that @xmath47 could be realized by probing even higher momenta beyond the rhic kinematic limit , e.g. by studying @xmath1 at the lhc .",

    "there are different models which try to extrapolate how the rapidity density of produced matter increases with @xmath138 .",
    "the eskola - kajantie - ruuskanen - tuominen ( ekrt ) model is among the models with the strongest predicted increase , and has the scaling @xmath140 .",
    "thus , the rapidity density of bulk matter increases significantly slower than the kinematic limit for increasing @xmath138 .",
    "although the medium lifetime may increase substantially with @xmath138 as well , the more relevant scale is the transverse size of the medium , as high @xmath12 partons move with the speed of light and will exit the medium once they reach its edge .",
    "however , the transverse size of the medium is approximately given by the overlap of the two nuclei , and hence to 0th approximation independent of @xmath138 ( beyond , there is of course the weak logarithmic growth of all total cross sections with @xmath138 ) .",
    "thus , for asymptotically high energies , the integration limits for a line integral along the parton path through the medium will not grow arbitrary large , and the integrand , i.e. the density distribution , will be the main change .",

    "as far as the shape of @xmath14 is concerned , the lhc predictions for both asw and yajem agree , however quantitatively they differ substantially . at the heart of this difference",

    "in contrast , within yajem , in addition to the harder slope of the parton spectrum , there is an explicit scale evolution of the medium effect in the mmff ( see fig .",
    "[ f - ffnew ] ) .",
    "since both mechanisms tend to increase @xmath1 , the combined effect of scale evolution and parton spectrum slope leads , all things considered , to less final state suppression in the yajem result .",
    "the shape of @xmath14 can be understood by the mechanisms also observed in the rhic case .",
    "the initial steep rise and subsequent flattening reflects the changing slope of the parton spectra .",
    "note that the transition from gluon dominated to quark - dominated hadron production is not an issue over most of the lhc kinematical range .",
    "the final enhancement above 2 tev is again driven by the fermi motion region in the nuclear pdfs . unlike in the rhic case , at lhc kinematics the suppression obtained from yajem for this region is not strong enough to mask the enhancement .",
    "finally , close to the kinematic limit , a small @xmath1 is obtained .",
    "these results indicate that there is no reason to expect that the limit @xmath47 can be observed even with lhc kinematics .",
    "however , the general trend for larger @xmath1 observed in the transition from rhic to lhc indicates that the limit could be reached for asymptotically high energies over a large kinematic range , however not close to the kinematic boundary .",
    "so far , the nuclear suppression factor @xmath1 has been observed experimentally only in a very limited kinematical region . in this region ,",
    "no strong @xmath0 dependence has been observed .",
    "the main expectation of how @xmath1 changes if observed over a larger kinematical range is that the suppression should eventually vanish and @xmath1 approach unity .",
    "the results presented here show that this expression is too simplistic .",
    "in particular , it is wrong to think of the shape of @xmath14 to be the result of any single cause .",
    "instead , many effects , among them the slope change of the pqcd parton spectrum , the scale evolution of the medium modification effect , the transition from gluon - dominated to quark - dominated hadron production and also the initial state nuclear effects all influence @xmath14 in a characteristic way .",
    "moreover , it is not sufficient to think of going to higher @xmath0 to see the lessening of the suppression  it matters how one approaches higher @xmath0 , in particular if one can push a measurement further up in @xmath0 with higher statistics , or if one measures a different system with higher @xmath138 . based on the results presented above",
    ", it appears unlikely that the simple limit @xmath47 for sufficiently high @xmath0 can be reached even at lhc kinematics .",
    "these findings may largely be of little practical value due to the impossibility of reaching out to a substantial fraction of the kinematic limit experimentally .",
    "however , theoretically they serve well to illustrate that even a hard probe observable like @xmath1 is never simple in the sense that it reflects directly tomographic properties of the medium , but rather that it is a convolution of many different effects which all need to be understood and discussed carefully . in particular , @xmath1 can not be interpreted as an observable reflecting properties of the medium causing a final state effect .",
    "the shape of the underlying parton spectrum or initial state effects are equally important to understand @xmath1 .    discussions with will horowitz , kari eskola and hannah petersen are gratefully acknowledged .",

    "<S> the suppression of high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) hadron production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions as compared to the scaled expectation from proton - proton ( p - p ) collisions expressed as the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 is experimentally well established and can be traced back to interactions between the hard parton shower and the soft bulk matter . </S>",
    "<S> physical intuition suggests that the medium modification should cease to be important when the hard scale of parton production is much larger than the typical momentum scale in the medium ( e.g. the temperature @xmath2 ) and that consequently @xmath3 for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath1 is not a simple observable , but rather results from many different mechanisms which influence what happens when @xmath0 increases . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 does not necessarily approch unity even if the hadron momentum is probed at the kinematic limit of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to identify and discuss such mechanisms and to present different model expectations of what one would find if one could measure suppression out to the kinematic limit for hard hadron production and give predictions for the @xmath0 dependence at both rhic and lhc . </S>"
