    "recently , the brookhaven e821 experiment has measured the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath1 for the @xmath15 to remarkable accuracy  @xcite : @xmath16 this had led to a @xmath17 deviation from the prediction of the standard model ( sm ) : @xmath18 eq .",
    "( 1 ) arises from an analysis of only about one quarter of the existing @xmath15 data .",
    "further , the 2001 run for the @xmath19 should result in about three times as much data as has been analysed for the @xmath15  @xcite . thus the statistical error in the measurement should decrease by about a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , the theoretical error in the hadronic vaccum polarization contribution should also be reduced ( perhaps by a factor of 2 ) by the analysis of the novosibirsk , daphne and beijing data .",
    "( for an analysis of the current theoretical accuracy of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution see  @xcite , and for an alternate view see  @xcite . )",
    "thus by the beginning of 2002 it should be possible to know whether the anomaly in the muon magnetic moment of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is real .",
    "if it is indeed real it would imply the discovery of new physics .",
    "because of the importance of this possibility , we will here assume that the anomaly is real , and analyze some of its consequences .",
    "supersymmetry offers a possible explanation of a deviation of @xmath21 from its sm value , and initial calculations of @xmath21 were made in the early 1980 s using global supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , in unbroken global supersymmetry there is a theorem that the total value of @xmath21 should vanish  @xcite , i.e. @xmath22 thus one needs broken supersymmetry to get a non - zero result , and how to do this in a phenomenologically acceptable way within the framework of global supersymmetry was problematical .",
    "the advent of supergravity ( sugra ) , where acceptable spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry occurs , led to the sugra grand unified ( gut ) models  @xcite .",
    "the first ( partial ) calculation of @xmath23 was done in  @xcite , and the first complete calculation in  @xcite . in the sugra gut models ,",
    "susy breaking at the gut scale @xmath24 , triggers the breaking of @xmath25 at the electroweak scale @xmath26 , and hence the susy mass scale @xmath27 obeys @xmath28 setting the scale of the susy masses to be in the 100 gev - 1 tev range , a range also needed to avoid the hierarchy problem .",
    "this mass scale was further supported by the fact that the lep data is consistent with grand unification if the susy masses lie in the range @xmath29 gev - 1 tev .",
    "further , sugra models with r parity invariance have a dark matter candidate , the lightest neutralino , @xmath30 , with the astronomically observed amount of relic density when the susy masses are in this range . thus with the mass range implied by the sugra gut models , it was possible to predict roughly the size of @xmath23 , and in fact in  @xcite it was argued that @xmath23 should become observable when the experiments had a sensitivity of about @xmath31 , as is the case for eq .",
    "we consider here , then the effect of @xmath23 for sugra gut models possessing r parity invariance .",
    "in particular , we consider ( 1 ) the msugra model  @xcite with universal soft breaking at @xmath24 , and ( 2 ) models with non - universal scalar masses at @xmath24 for the higgs bosons and the third generation of squarks and sleptons .",
    "in the following we impose the current experimental bounds on the susy parameter space and list now the important ones :    1 .",
    "accelerator bounds : ( i ) we consider two possible values for the light higgs mass @xmath8 gev and @xmath11 gev .",
    "the first is the current lep bound  @xcite while the second represents a bound that the tevatron run iib could achieve , if it does not discover the higgs boson .",
    "we assume for the @xmath32 branching ratio the roughly @xmath33 range : @xmath34 2 .",
    "relic density bounds for the lightest neutralino .",
    "we chose here the range @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the critical density to close the universe : @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 is the hubble constant , @xmath40 km / sec mpc , @xmath41 the newton constant ) .",
    "the lower bound in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is smaller than the conventional value of @xmath42 , but can take into account the possibility that there is more than one species of dark matter . our results here , however",
    ", are insensitive to this lower bound and would not change significantly if it were raised to 0.05 or 0.1 .",
    "we use a @xmath43 bound on the muon magnetic moment anomaly of eq .",
    "( 2 ) : @xmath44    as we will see these will combine to put strong constraints on the susy parameter space and allow us to greatly strengthen the predictions for the neutralino - proton dark matter cross sections @xmath45 , as well as determine what parts of the susy mass spectrum can be seen at the tevatron run ii , lhc and nlc accelerators .    in order to get accurate results ,",
    "it is necessary to include a number of corrections in the calculation , and we mention here the most important ones : ( 1 ) the allowed susy parameter space is now quite sensitive to the higgs mass , and so an accurate calculation of @xmath46 is important .",
    "we include here the one and two loop corrections  @xcite and the pole mass corrections .",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath46 is still uncertain by about 3 gev , and so the experimental bound of @xmath8 gev will ( conservatively ) be interpreted as a theoretical evaluation of @xmath47 gev ( and similarly @xmath11 gev as @xmath48 gev ) .",
    "( 2 ) large @xmath3 nlo corrections to the @xmath49 decay rate  @xcite are included .",
    "( 3 ) loop corrections to @xmath50 and @xmath51 are included ( which are important for large @xmath3 ) . ( 4 ) qcd renormalization group corrections in going below the scale @xmath27 are used .",
    "( 5 ) in the relic density calculation , all slepton neutralino co - annihilation effects are included with an analysis valid for large @xmath3 .",
    "there are now several groups that have carried out this calculation  @xcite , and we have checked that they are generally in good agreement .    we have not assumed any specific gut group relations , such as yukawa unification or proton decay constraints ( except for grand unification of the gauge coupling constants ) . such relations depend on physics beyond the gut scale about which little is known , and need not , for example , hold in string models , even when coupling constant unification is required .",
    "the msugra model  @xcite is the simplest possible model with universal soft breaking masses at @xmath24 .",
    "it depends on four parameters and one sign : @xmath52 , the masses of the scalar particles at @xmath24 ; @xmath53 , the gaugino masses at @xmath24 ; @xmath54 , the cubic soft breaking mass at @xmath24 ; @xmath3 , the ratio of the higgs vevs , @xmath55 , at the electroweak scale ; and the sign of @xmath56 , the higgs mixing parameter in the superpotential ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we allow the above parameters to vary over the following ranges : @xmath58 , @xmath59 tev , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "it has been known from the beginning  @xcite that @xmath23 increases with @xmath62 .",
    "the leading terms come from the chargino ( @xmath63 ) diagrams where the muon can polarize into a chargino and a sneutrino . expanding for @xmath64 ( which generally is the case for msugra ) ,",
    "one finds for this leading term  @xcite , @xmath65 f(x ) % ...... [ eq.(3 ) of hep - ph/0102344 ]      \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a form factor arising from the loop integration .",
    "this implies that the sign of @xmath23 is determined by the sign of @xmath56  @xcite , and since experimentally , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one has that @xmath21 has a positive anomaly , one has that @xmath69    this result has immediate consequences for dark matter detection . thus the scattering of neutralinos by nuclei in dark matter detectors",
    "is governed by the cross section @xmath45 , and for @xmath70 , cancellations can occur reducing these cross sections to below @xmath71 pb in large regions of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "this is exhibited in fig .",
    "1 . if @xmath56 were negative , one would require a detector well beyond anything that is currently planned , and so dark matter experiments would not be able to scan the full susy parameter space . however , with eq .",
    "9 , one finds that cross sections generally are greater than @xmath72  @xcite , accessible to future planned detectors such as genius  @xcite or cryoarray  @xcite .",
    "( aadcoan61020.epsf width 10 cm )    eq .",
    "( 9 ) also has important theoretical consequences for the msugra model .",
    "thus we first note that the combined experimental constraints on the higgs mass and the @xmath2 branching ratio , implies that most of the allowed parameter space is in the co - annihilation region of the parameter space , i. e. @xmath4 gev .",
    "this means that @xmath52 is essentially determined in terms of @xmath53 ( for fixed @xmath54 and @xmath73 ) as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 . in particular",
    ", this means that @xmath52 is an increasing function of @xmath53 .",
    "now @xmath23 decreases with increasing @xmath53 and increasing @xmath52 .",
    "thus the lower bound of @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( 7 ) then implies an upper bound on @xmath53 ( since an increase in @xmath53 can not be compensated by a decrease of @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus the combined effects of the data is to give now both lower bounds on @xmath53 ( from @xmath46 and @xmath2 ) and upper bounds on @xmath53 ( from @xmath21 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . if however , the @xmath21 data had required @xmath74 ( instead of eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) with the same lower bound on @xmath75 , then the @xmath46 and @xmath2 constraints for this sign of @xmath56 would have essentially eliminated all the msugra parameter space .",
    "( 7 ) also represents an experimental test of the validity of the msugra model .",
    "( adhs3.epsf width 10 cm )    ( adhs6.epsf width 10 cm )    since @xmath46 is an increasing function of @xmath53 and @xmath3 , the fact that @xmath53 is bounded from above , and @xmath46 is bounded from below implies a lower bound on @xmath3 .",
    "we find at the @xmath76 c. l. that for @xmath8 gev @xmath77 and for @xmath11 gev one would have @xmath78 we see that the @xmath21 anomaly favors large @xmath3 .",
    "3 also shows that the msugra model can not accommodate large values of @xmath23 , and if the final e821 results were significantly higher than @xmath79 , this would be a signal for non - universal soft breaking .    the strong constraints on @xmath53 discussed above also sharpens considerably the predictions that msugra has for the susy mass spectrum expected at accelerators .",
    "to see what these are , we consider the @xmath80 c. l. on the @xmath21 anomaly , i.e. we require now @xmath81  @xcite . in this case one",
    "finds that for @xmath82 that @xmath83 .",
    "then for @xmath84 , @xmath53 and @xmath52 are constrained as follows : @xmath85    in table 1 we give the range expected for the susy masses implied by these constraints .",
    "all the masses except the light stop , @xmath86 , are insensitive to @xmath54 and the lower bound for @xmath87 can be lowered to 240 gev by decreasing @xmath54 to @xmath88 . from this",
    "we see that the trilepton signal unfortunately would be out of reach of the tevatron run ii ( @xmath3 and @xmath53 are too large  @xcite ) and run ii ( with @xmath89 ) would only be able to see the light higgs provided @xmath90 gev  @xcite .",
    "a 500 gev nlc would be able to detect the @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and cover only part of the parameter space for the light selectron , @xmath93 .",
    "the lhc , however , would be able to see the full susy spectrum .",
    "_ allowed ranges for susy masses in gev for msugra assuming 90% c. l. for @xmath21 for @xmath94 .",
    "the lower value of @xmath95can be reduced to 240 gev by changing @xmath54 to -@xmath96 .",
    "the other masses are not sensitive to @xmath54 . _  @xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( adhs2.epsf width 10 cm )    we saw above that the experimental requirement that @xmath23 be positive , i. e. that @xmath97 , eliminated much of the parameter space that would not be accessible to dark matter detectors .",
    "in addition , the lower bound of eq .",
    "( 7 ) produces an upper bound on @xmath53 and @xmath52 , and since the dark matter detection cross section , @xmath45 , decreases with increasing @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the lower bound on @xmath45 is raised for the remaining @xmath97 part of the parameter space .",
    "4 shows the expected cross sections for @xmath98 , @xmath97 , @xmath8 gev , for @xmath99 , @xmath96 , 0 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "we see that there is a significant dependence on @xmath54 , and over the full range , @xmath100 pb . if the higgs bound was raised to @xmath11 gev , then the lower bounds on @xmath53 increase to 200 gev , 215 gev , and 246 gev respectively , significantly further reducing the parameter space .",
    "if we reduce @xmath3 one would expect @xmath45 to fall .",
    "however , for lower @xmath3 , the upper bound on @xmath53 becomes more constraining , eliminating more of the high @xmath53 , @xmath52 region , and thus compensating partially for the reduction of @xmath73 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "5 where @xmath45 is given for @xmath101 , @xmath82 ( upper curve ) and @xmath102 ( lower curve ) .",

    "( aadcoan40newnon2.epsf width 10 cm )    while this model has a number of additional parameters , one can understand the physics of what is implied from the following considerations .",

    "one sees that for @xmath112 , the universal part of @xmath113 depending on @xmath114 is quite small , and so this term is sensitive to the amount of non - universal soft breaking that might be present .",
    "now much of the physics is governed by @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath113 is decreased , then the higgsino part of @xmath115 will increase .",

    "this allows a new region of allowed relic density at high @xmath3 and high @xmath52 .",
    "second , since @xmath45 depends on the interference term between the higgsino and gaugino parts of the neutralino , the dark matter detection cross section will be increased with increasing higgsino content . to illustrate these effects , we consider two cases    ( adhs4.epsf width 10 cm )    \\(1 ) @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 .    here",
    "one sees that the @xmath114 term contributes negatively to @xmath113 .",
    "the effect of this is shown in fig .",
    "6 where the region allowed by the relic density constraint in the @xmath120 plane for @xmath98 , @xmath121 is given .",
    "the lower corridor , coming from the stau - neutralino co - annihilation is much the same as the @xmath82 corridor in fig .",
    "the upper channel , at higher @xmath52 , is due to the s - channel @xmath14- pole annihilation .",
    "7 shows the neutralino proton cross sections for corresponding allowed regions as a function of @xmath53 ( @xmath122 ) , for @xmath98 . in spite of the fact that @xmath52 is quite high for the @xmath14 s - channel corridor , the cross sections is quite large , and",
    "at least part of the this region should be accessible to genius -tf , and cdms in the soudan mine .",

    "this is a model that might arise in a @xmath124 gut , where only the particles of the @xmath125 representation in the third generation have non - universal soft breaking masses .",
    "again , the non - universalities lower the value of @xmath113 , allowing for a @xmath14 s - channel corridor in the relic density analysis .",
    "in addition , because the soft breaking mass of the stau is reduced , the co - annihilation channel occurs at a higher value of @xmath52 .",
    "this is shown in fig . 8 , for @xmath98 , where the bottom band , the usual msugra co - annihilation channel , is now moved up to much higher @xmath52 .",
    "( this co - annihilation and the @xmath14-channel annihilation corridors merge for @xmath126 gev . ) the corresponding cross sections are shown in fig .",

    "we have examined here the @xmath0 deviation of @xmath127 from its predicted standard model result under the assumption that the effect is real and can be understood in terms supergravity gut models with r - parity invariance . for msugra models , the combined constraints from the @xmath21 , @xmath46 , and the @xmath2 decay constraints and the relic density of @xmath115 dark matter greatly",
    "limit the susy parameter space , greatly tightening the predictions the theory can make .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath21 produces an upper bound on @xmath53 , and then the @xmath46 and @xmath2 constraints produce lower bounds on @xmath53 and @xmath3 .",
    "we find that for @xmath8 gev , that @xmath128 for @xmath129 and for @xmath11 gev , @xmath12 for @xmath130 .",

    "the restrictions on the allowed range of @xmath53 and @xmath52 allow one now to make significant predictions concerning accelerator reaches for the susy particles .",
    "thus we find at @xmath131 c. l. bounds on @xmath21 that the tevatron run ii should be able to see the light higgs ( if @xmath90 gev ) , but no other parts of the susy spectrum",

    "the current anomaly in @xmath21 is a @xmath0 effect .",
