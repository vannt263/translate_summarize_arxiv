    "the diffusion of solute gases in liquids is a well - studied and relatively well - understood problem ; see , e.g.  @xcite . in the classical formulation of the problem ,",
    "the diffusion flux of guest atoms or molecules is expressed in terms of various thermodynamic `` forces''concentration , pressure , and temperature gradients .",
    "usually , the liquid - gas interface does not influence the nature of the bulk diffusion and determines only the boundary conditions for the flux .",
    "there exists , however , a vast class of systems , called `` bubbly liquids '' , e.g.  @xcite , where the liquid - gas interface maintains the gas - solution saturation all over the liquid volume and serves as a source / sink for the diffusion flux of the solute molecules ( i.e. , the diffusion flux does not change the solute concentration with time , but redistributes the mass between gas bubbles ) .",
    "thus the liquid - gas interface plays an important role in the bulk diffusion of solutes . on the macroscopic scale , the diffusive mass transport of solutes may be very unusual and surprising in these systems .    in the present study ,",
    "we address bubbly liquids with immobile bubbles .",
    "these may be trapped by the surface forces in a porous matrix , therefore , for concreteness , we will consider liquids in porous media . among numerous examples of such systems , which are of great practical importance ,",
    "are the oil - bearing porous massifs , seabeds in organic carbon - rich marine sediments  @xcite , aquifers  @xcite , peat - bogs and swamps . for these systems ,",
    "the presence of immobilized gas bubbles or liquid drops is well established experimentally .",
    "the respective solute gases include methane , carbon dioxide , oxygen , nitrogen , etc .",
    "moreover , the problem of diffusion of the carbon dioxide in porous medium , filled with bubbly liquid ( water ) is directly related to the problem of burial of industrial release of @xmath0 , e.g.  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we sketch a typical system , where the diffusion of a solute gas takes place in a bubbly liquid in a porous matrix .",
    "we will study diffusion transport on large space and time scales .",
    "namely , we will be interested in the space scale much larger than the characteristic size of a gas bubble and in the time scale much larger than the characteristic relaxation time for gas dissolution in liquid ; hence we assume that all over the volume , the solute gas is saturated in the solution .",
    "indeed , for marine sediments the solution relaxation times measured by hours are small compared to the global evolution time scales , which can be as large as millions of years . to estimate the pore size @xmath1 needed to trap a bubble of the comparable size we notice that the surface - tension forces , equal to @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the surface tension ) , should overwhelm the buoyancy force @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the density of a liquid ; @xmath6 is the gravity ) .",
    "this yields the estimate , @xmath7 , implying the maximal pore size @xmath8 for water , which suggests trapping even for sands .",
    "we consider the immobilization of pore - size bubbles , because a big moving bubble is unstable to splitting  @xcite ; it either stops or experiences splitting into smaller bubbles until their size becomes comparable to the pore size .",
    "we assume that our space scale is much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "it is not straightforward to estimate the relaxation time for the gas dissolution ; therefore , we just assume that the condition of the gas saturation in liquid is always fulfilled .",
    "another important feature of bubbly liquids in porous media ( relevant for many geological systems ) is the presence of a temperature gradient ( usually due to the geothermal gradient ) and a pressure gradient ( due to the hydrostatic pressure ) . on the microscopic level",
    ", the temperature gradient causes the thermodiffusion ( the so - called `` soret effect ''  @xcite ) , while the pressure gradient manifests the presence of the gravitational forces .",
    "due to different mobilities and masses of the solute and solvent molecules these may cause an additional mass flux . although the importance of thermodiffusion for soil gas exchange has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the diffusion flux due to the concentration gradient ( fickian diffusion ) has been investigated so far  @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we consider the diffusive transport of a solute gas in liquid in a porous medium without any significant through - flow in the system ; that is , we consider only molecular and not hydrodynamic diffusion  @xcite .",
    "we show that for large space and time scales , which assume the saturation condition for the solute gas , and under temperature and pressure gradients a novel and interesting phenomenon may be observed  the diffusive accumulation of gas in certain regions , caused by the non - fickian transport of solutes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dbl ] the diffusion flux of a solute gas in bubbly liquid is considered in the presence of pressure and temperature gradients ; the evolution equation for the gas concentration is obtained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geo ] we demonstrate the existence of a novel phenomenon  the diffusive accumulation of solute gas in certain regions .",
    "we analyze this effect for real geological systems  the methane or carbon dioxide bearing massifs in the presence of the geothermal gradient . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we summarize our findings .",
    "some technical details are given in the appendixes .",
    "the diffusion current of guest particles in a host material in the presence of concentration and temperature gradients and an external potential generally has three components , each being the response to their respective driving force : the fickian flux , due to the concentration gradient , the thermodiffusion flux , due to the temperature gradient , and the flux due to the mobility of particles subjected to an external force .",
    "when there are no external forces except gravity , which also creates the pressure gradient , the diffusion flux of a dilute solution reads  @xcite @xmath9 , \\label{eq - dbl-01}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the molar fraction ( concentration ) of the solute in the solution , @xmath11 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute molecules in the solvent , @xmath12 is the thermodiffusion constant ( @xmath13 is the soret coefficient ) , and @xmath14 is the universal gas constant .",

    "when the liquid is saturated with gas bubbles and the bubbles are in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the solution , the concentration of the solute in the solvent equals solubility , @xmath19 , everywhere in the liquid .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium implies the equality of the chemical potentials of the gas dissolved in the liquid ( @xmath20 ) and that of the vapor phase ( @xmath21 ) , that is , @xmath22 .",

    "this assumption is valid several tens of kelvins below the water boiling temperature , while the systems where liquids are at near - boiling conditions , say geysers , are beyond the scope of the present study .    using @xmath37 $ ] , one obtains for the total flux : @xmath38 .",

    "hence the mass balance reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the molar fraction of bubbles in the bubbly fluid , that is , in the system comprised by bubbles and liquid . for the space scales addressed here",
    "we do not need to consider the microscopic processes of the bubbles growth and clustering as in  @xcite , and the single characteristic , @xmath42 , suffices in our case .    hence for moderate pressures we obtain the following equation for the evolution of a nondissolved gas phase : @xmath43 \\right ) .",

    "in what follows we consider the one - dimensional diffusion of solutes in bubbly liquids in the presence of temperature and density gradients , using for the latter quantities some typical geological values .",

    "<S> when gas bubbles are immovably trapped in a porous matrix by surface - tension forces , the dominant mechanism of transfer of gas mass becomes the diffusion of gas molecules through the liquid . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the gas solution is in local thermodynamic equilibrium with vapor phase all over the system , i.e. , the solute concentration equals the solubility . </S>",
    "<S> when temperature and/or pressure gradients are applied , diffusion fluxes appear and these fluxes are faithfully determined by the temperature and pressure fields , not by the local solute concentration , which is enslaved by the former . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the equations governing such systems , accounting for thermodiffusion and gravitational segregation effects which are shown not to be neglected for geological systems  marine sediments , terrestrial aquifers , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the results are applied for the treatment of non - high - pressure systems and real geological systems bearing methane or carbon dioxide , where we find a potential possibility of the formation of gaseous horizons deep below a porous medium surface . </S>",
    "<S> the reported effects are of particular importance for natural methane hydrate deposits and the problem of burial of industrial production of carbon dioxide in deep aquifers . </S>"
