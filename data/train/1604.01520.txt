    "the idea of transporting information through electron spins instead of charge , _ spintronics _",
    "@xcite , has opened a promising pathway to quantum information processing and quantum computation in the future .",
    "spurred by the measurement of tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions  @xcite , and the observation of giant magneto - resistance in magnetic multilayers  @xcite , the search for the integration of memory and logic in a single storage device has taken an inspiring shape in the last couple of decades .",
    "a substantial part of the existing research focuses on experiments related to spin polarized electron transport in nanostructures . the quantum confinement effect on transport of electrons",
    "was studied by several groups  @xcite .",
    "tunable spin filters have been developed where charge carriers with different spin states were separated in gaas samples  @xcite .",
    "a ` non - local ' spin valve geometry was used to study spin transport in single graphene layers  @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of a quantum spin pump using a gaas quantum dot  @xcite , an ` open ' quantum dot driven by ac gate voltages  @xcite , along with several other works such as the study of spontaneous spin polarized transport in magnetic nanowires  @xcite , or an analysis of the spin polarization of the linear conductance of a quantum wire spin filter  @xcite , have enriched the field of spin polarized transport .",
    "the design of molecular wires and spin polarized tunneling devices  @xcite is also in the cards in the current era of spintronics .",
    "needless to say , such experiments have inspired a bulk of theoretical investigations of spin transport , or spin polarized coherent electronic transport in nano structures , in model quantum dots or magnetic nanowires  @xcite , or , in a very recent work , modeling a ferroelectric polymer grown on top of a silicene nanoribbon  @xcite .",
    "a widely adopted line of attack has been to work within a tight - binding formalism in which a nano wire is simulated by placing ` magnetic atoms ' in a line , and sandwiching the array between two semi - infinite magnetic or non - magnetic leads  @xcite .",
    "green s function method and transfer matrix techniques  @xcite are then used to extract spectral information and linear conductance .",
    "though simple enough , such model studies indeed bring out some subtleties of coherent spin dependent electronic transport , often showing the spin filtering effect over selected ranges of energy  @xcite .",
    "while spin polarized transport of electrons has been the main concern so far , transport of particles with spins higher than that of an electron , even in one dimension ( 1d ) , has not received the same level of attention .",
    "this is , to our mind , an area which needs to be explored in order to unravel the possibility of designing novel storage devices which rely on the transportation or spin filtering of ultracold bosonic or fermionic quantum gases exhibiting higher spin states .",
    "spin-@xmath3 particles , for example , can be realized with alkali atoms of @xmath4li , @xmath5cs , and alkaline earth atoms of @xmath6be , @xmath7ba , and @xmath8ba .",
    "these large - spin atomic fermions display diverse many - body phenomena , and can be made experimentally through controlled interactions in spin scattering channels  @xcite . experimentally realized 1d strongly correlated liquids of ultracold fermions with a tunable number of spin components  @xcite , spin polarized hydrogen which remains gaseous down to zero temperature , and happens to be a good candidate for bose condensation in a dilute atomic gas , or a gas of ultracold @xmath9cr atoms forming a dipolar gas of high spin atoms  @xcite , are some of the recently developed quantum systems which provide a versatile and robust platform for probing fundamental problems in condensed matter physics , as well as finding applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing .",
    "thus the availability of high spin state particles opens up an unexplored area of engineering spin filters for spins higher than @xmath10 .",
    "it is already appreciated that , in contrast to the conventional spin-@xmath11 electronic case , large - spin ultracold atomic fermions , even in 1d , exhibit richer spin phenomena  @xcite .",
    "thus , exploring the possibility of selecting out a state with a definite spin projection using a suitable quantum device might lead to innovative manipulation and control of spin transport .",
    "this precisely , is the motivation of the present communication .",
    "we get exciting results . using a simple 1d chain of magnetic atoms , mimicking a quantum gas in an artificial periodic potential , we show within a tight - binding framework that a suitable correlation between the spin @xmath0 of the incoming beam of particles , and the magnetic moment @xmath12 offered by the substrate atoms can open up a gap in the energy spectrum .",
    "the opening of the gap turns out to be crucial in transporting a given spin state over a specified range of fermi energy , while blocking the remaining spin states .",
    "the simple 1d chain of magnetic atoms of spin @xmath0 is shown to be equivalent to a @xmath13-strand ladder network .",
    "this equivalence is exploited to work out the precise criterion of opening up of the spectral gap .",
    "the results seem to be robust against at least a minimal incorporation of disorder , as suggested by the results of spin polarized transport for a spin spiral , as reported in this communication .",
    "in section  [ sec2 ] we describe the basic scheme in terms of the spin-@xmath11 and spin-@xmath2 particles .",
    "the difference equations are established which will finally be used to obtain the spectra in the respective cases .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] describes how to engineer the spectral gaps using an appropriate substrate and provides the general criterion for opening up of the spectral gap for arbitrary spins .",
    "the discussion is substantiated by a detailed presentation of the density of states ( dos ) choosing the spin-@xmath11 case as example . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we present the results of the transport calculations for the spin-@xmath11 and spin-@xmath2 cases . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we discuss the idea of having a spin filtering with a correlated disorder . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we show the robustness of the results by considering a spin - spiral where the substrate atoms have their magnetic moments turning sequentially , in a periodic fashion , mimicking disorder over a length shorter than the period , and in section  [ conclu ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the appendices contain the details of the transport formulation , and further details are provided in the supplemental material .",
