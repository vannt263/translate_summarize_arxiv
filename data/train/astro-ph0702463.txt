    "dust grains in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies are heated by various energy sources in vastly different physical environments : the diffuse interstellar radiation field , active star formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the bulk of the emission from heated dust grains occurs at far - ir and submillimeter ( submm ) wavelengths , and can account for a significant , if not dominant , fraction of the total energy output from dust - enshrouded galaxies where extinction and re - radiation by dust lead to high ir - to - optical flux ratios .    in the latter category",
    "we find the population of ulirgs ( @xmath12 ) , which were first discovered in large numbers in the local universe by _ iras _ ( soifer et al .",
    "these galaxies harbor vast amounts of dust , responsible for obscuring most of the intense star formation and agn activity that are taking place .",
    "observations in the optical / near - ir as well as of rotational co line emission revealed that ulirgs tend to be associated with interacting or merging gas - rich disks , with the more luminous being the more disturbed and morphologically complex systems ( sanders & mirabel  1996 ) , thus suggesting that ulirgs are driven by mergers in which gas is funneled towards the central regions , fueling an intense starburst and/or a black hole .",
    "while local ( @xmath13 ) ulirgs are believed to re - enact some of the processes relevant for galaxy formation at high redshifts , it is essential that studies of ulirgs over a wide redshift range are carried out , in order to get a complete picture of how the most massive galaxies formed as a function of redshift . at high redshifts ( @xmath14 ) , the population of optically faint radio sources  which includes ( sub)mm - selected galaxies ( smgs ) uncovered by scuba and mambo ( smail et al .  1997 ;",

    "in contrast to the populations of local and distant ulirgs , the population at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath15 ) remains virtually unexplored at far - ir / submm wavelengths .",
    "this intermediate redshift interval is of particular interest as it bridges the gap between the distant and local ulirg populations , and broadly marks the transition period where ulirgs cede their position to the less extreme luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs  @xmath16 ) as the dominating contributor to the co - moving ir luminosity density ( le floch et al .",

    "we argue the observed difference can be explained as the combined effects of selection effects and intrinsic evolution in the ulirg population as a function of redshift .",

    "unbiased wide surveys with scuba - ii and herschel at @xmath125 m are expected to uncover cool sources at @xmath126 if they exist , thus allowing for a more direct comparison with the high-@xmath11 population .",
    "while at least part of the observed differences in dust masses and temperatures between the various samples can be attributed to the selection effects specific to each sample , real cosmological evolution of the ulirg population with redshift appears to play a significant role .",
    "this is strongly evidenced by the lack of very luminous ( @xmath127@xmath9 ) sources in the low-@xmath11 sample , which reflects the well - known decrease in the abundance of such extreme systems by about three orders of magnitude from @xmath128 to the present day . at moderate redshifts ,",
    "such systems are more common as suggested by the overlap in far - ir luminosity between our sample and the high-@xmath11 smgs .",
    "finally , we wish to argue that the higher dust temperatures observed in our sample of ulirgs at moderate redshifts , as compared to those of the high-@xmath11 smgs , may be linked to variations in the characteristic physical scale on which star formation dominates at these two different epochs .",
    "( [ lfirtd ] ) suggests that the observed @xmath44 , characterizing the large - scale sed of a galaxy , is determined by the total dust heating ( and by implication the global star formation rate ) per unit dust mass within the galaxy .",
    "the dust temperature is therefore linked to the global star formation efficiency , subject to uncertainties in dust emissivity , additional dust heating , and gas - to - dust ratio . at the same time",
    ", the star formation efficiency is known to be primarily regulated by gas density in star - forming regions ( schmidt law ) across enormous ranges spanning @xmath129 orders of magnitude in gas densities and star formation rates ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "calculations by yang  ( 2006 ) have shown that a general relationship can be expected to exist between the observed @xmath5and the spatial extent of star formation , suggesting higher observed @xmath5are generally indicative of star formation that occurs over more concentrated regions .",
    "this proposed link is in good agreement with observational evidence ; high - resolution radio observations of ( cooler ) high - redshift smgs show spatially extended starbursts on scales of @xmath1710kpc ( chapman et al .",
    "2004a ) , while the few local ulirgs with far - ir luminosities comparable to that of smgs in general have higher dust temperatures with the dust and molecular gas being concentrated in compact regions with scales on the order of 0.1@xmath171kpc ( young & scoville 1991 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "today s mm interferometers such as the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) have just about the sufficient sensitivity as well as spatial resolution ( fwhm@xmath130 at 1.3 mm for pdbi  in its extended b and a configuration ) to allow us to detect and marginally resolve the dust emission in sources such as the ones in our sample .",
    "however , such observations are extremely challenging and time consuming , and will at best provide us with only a rough gauge , or even perhaps only an upper limit , of the physical extent of the dust .",
    "of course , once alma comes on - line the situation will improve dramatically , resulting in detailed maps of the dust emission that will not only pinpoint the hot dust , which presumably originates from compact regions of intense star formation and/or agn - activity , but also outline the morphology and scale of any underlying , cooler dust reservoir that may exist .",
    "this paper reports 350@xmath0 m observations of 36 intermediate - redshift ulirgs ( @xmath1 ) , out of which 28 are detected .",
    "the newly acquired 350@xmath0 m data are the first reported flux measurements longward of 100@xmath0 m for these galaxies , and lead to meaningful estimates of their dust temperatures ( @xmath41@xmath40 ) and far - ir luminosities ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "these intermediate - redshift ulirgs appear to host large amount of warm dust ( @xmath60 ) and are experiencing intense starburst activity ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the far - ir / radio correlation observed in star - forming galaxies in the local universe remains valid for ulirgs in the more distant universe over the redshift range of @xmath101 , where dust heating seems predominantly powered by ongoing star formation , with modest contribution to the far - ir luminosity from older stars and agns .",
    "far - ir luminosities and dust temperatures derived for dusty galaxies over a wide range of redshifts reveal a general positive relation between theses two quantities .",
    "however , there is significant scatter in the relation , due to differing selection biases as well as variations in dust mass and grain properties .",
    "we argue that the somewhat higher dust temperatures of our sample compared to the high-@xmath11 smgs are possibly tied to the more compact spatial scales of the ongoing star formation .",
    "we thank attila kovcs for help with data reduction and taking data on our behalf ; andrew blain for useful discussions and providing part of the data ; and philip best for providing us with agn / starburst classifications for some of our sources .",
    "we are deeply grateful to the referee for insightful and thorough comments .",
