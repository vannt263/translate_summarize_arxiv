    "this paper concerns the problem of the high probability state transfer ( hpst ) @xcite between different nodes of the spin 1/2 chain , which becomes a popular problem due to the development of the quantum communication systems and quantum computing . by `` state transfer '' we mean the following phenomenon @xcite .",
    "consider the chain of spins 1/2 with dipole - dipole interactions in the strong external magnetic field .",
    "let all spins be directed along the external magnetic field except the @xmath6th one whose initial state is arbitrary , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 mean the spin directed along and opposite the external magnetic field respectively .",
    "let the energy of the ground state ( all spins are aligned along the magnetic field ) be zero .",
    "if the state of @xmath10th node becomes @xmath11 with @xmath12 at time moment @xmath13 then we say that the state has been transfered from the @xmath6th to the @xmath10th node with the phase shift @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath15 , all other spins are directed along the field at @xmath16 , i.e. their states are @xmath17 .",
    "function @xmath18 is the transition amplitude of an excited state @xmath19 from the @xmath6th to the @xmath10th node .",
    "note that if all nodes of the chain have equal larmor frequencies and we are interested in the state propagation between two nodes , say between @xmath20th to @xmath21th nodes , then the shift @xmath22 may be simply removed by the proper choice of the constant magnetic field value @xcite , so that @xmath23 , i.e. the state is perfectly transfered .",
    "there exists a wide literature studying the state transfer along the spin chains in the strong external magnetic field .",
    "for instance , propagation of the spin waves in homogeneous chains was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the state may be perfectly transfered between two end nodes @xcite as well as between two symmetrical inner nodes @xcite in the inhomogeneous chain .",
    "state propagation along the alternating chains was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the chains with week end bonds provide the state transfer from one to another side of the chain .",
    "end - to - end entanglement in both alternating chains and chains with weak end bonds has been studied in@xcite .",
    "some aspects of the entanglement between remote nodes of the chain have been studied in @xcite .    however , all these references consider the state transfer between two end nodes ( or between two symmetrical nodes ) which is required for the construction of the communication channels where the state must be transfered from one object to another",
    ". meanwhile , the quantum computation requires such systems which have hpsts among many different nodes and , as a consequence , may distribute information among these nodes",
    ". such systems may be candidates for the quantum register .",
    "emphasise that , as it was indicated above , the excited state may be transfered from the initial @xmath6th node to some @xmath10th node with proper phase shift @xmath24 .",
    "however , we will show that all these shifts may be removed in a simple way introducing the time dependent magnetic field , see sec.[section : xyz ] ( remember that the single phase shift can be removed by a constant magnetic field , like it was done in the case of the state propagation between two nodes @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in general , the phase shifts @xmath24 do not create serious obstacles for the quantum communications .",
    "the only problem is the organization of the state transfers with big values of @xmath25 .",
    "a simple variant of such systems is suggested in our paper .",
    "namely , we construct the chain of @xmath1 nodes which has set @xmath26 of @xmath27 nodes @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 with the hpsts between any two of them , i.e. if the unknown state @xmath31 is generated in any particular node @xmath32 from the set @xmath26 ( while the initial states of all other nodes are @xmath8 ) then this state may be detected with high probability in any other node @xmath33 from the set @xmath26 after appropriate time intervals .",
    "hereafter we will use the notation @xmath34 for the chain shown in fig.[fig : gen ] .    here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the numbers of nodes in @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "let us clarify the structure of this scheme .",
    "each of the chains @xmath37 , @xmath39 , allows the hpst between its end nodes @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "chains @xmath42 collect all inner nodes of @xmath37 and consequently have @xmath43 nodes .",
    "two chains @xmath37 and @xmath44 are connected by the `` week bond '' through the chain @xmath38 , @xmath45 . by `` week bond '' between @xmath37 and @xmath44",
    "we mean the following necessary inequality among the coupling constants : @xmath46    emphasize that , also the hpst is organized between end nodes of each particular chain @xmath37 ( taken out of the general chain ) , the whole chain @xmath47 does not provide the hpsts between all @xmath28 ( @xmath48 ) in general case . however , we are interested in the particular form of the chain @xmath47 which does provide the hpst among all nodes @xmath28 .",
    "first of all , such chain must be symmetrical and may be written as ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , see fig.[fig : d1 ] .",
    "let the chain have @xmath1 nodes .",
    "we use notations @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the probability of the exited state transfer between @xmath56th and @xmath57th nodes , for the time interval required for this transfer and for the phase shift of the transfered exited state , @xmath58 : @xmath59 due to the symmetry of the chain , we have the following identities : @xmath60    because of the wide spread of the coupling constants , the time interval @xmath61 needed for the state transfer between @xmath56 and @xmath57 significantly depends on the values @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in general , @xmath62 i.e. the state may be transfered between two nodes much faster if both nodes are placed in the same half of the chain . thus , an important characteristic of such chain is the interval @xmath63    hereafter the state transfer between the nodes @xmath56 and @xmath57 will be referred to as hpst if @xmath64 the value @xmath65 is conventional .",
    "we take @xmath66 in examples of sec.[section:4n ] and in example 1 of sec.[section : def ] and @xmath67 in examples of sec.[section:8n ] and in example 2 of sec.[section : def ] .",
    "the set of all possible hpsts between any two nodes from the list @xmath26 will be referred to as hpst@xmath68 , where @xmath1 is the total number of nodes in the chain .",
    "we call the parameters of hpst@xmath68 in such chain the set of parameters @xmath69    since the organization of the hpsts among different nodes of the set of @xmath70 nodes is an essential property of the quantum register , the chains constructed in this paper may be candidates for this role .    while the nodes @xmath28 may serve as the q - bits of the quantum register ,",
    "the chains @xmath42 ( and @xmath38 ) serve to decrease the time intervals @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 ) required for the state transfer between the nodes @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( and between the nodes @xmath41 and @xmath73 ) separated by the long distance as it happens in the communication channels .",
    "namely , if @xmath37 consists of two nodes @xmath40 and @xmath41 then the time interval @xmath74 may be reduced putting additional chain @xmath42 with properly adjusted coupling constants between these two nodes .",
    "similarly , the time interval @xmath72 required to transfer the excited state between the last node of @xmath37 ( i.e. node @xmath41 ) and the first node of @xmath44 ( i.e. node @xmath73 ) may be reduced putting chain @xmath38 with properly adjusted coupling constants between @xmath37 and @xmath44 , see , for instance , chain @xmath75 in fig.[fig : d6_4n_mod_ex ] .",
    "thus the above spin chain @xmath76 combines properties of both quantum register and communication channel .",
    "finally we note that , constructing the spin chain , we want @xmath77    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[section : xyz ] we show that @xmath78 matrix representation of the xxz hamiltonian may be reduced to the @xmath79 matrix representation for a certain type of problems .",
    "sec.[section:4n ] describes the general structures of the spin chains having the set @xmath26 of four nodes ; simple examples are represented .",
    "similar study of the eight node chain is given in sec.[section:8n ] .",
    "deformations of the above chains decreasing parameter @xmath80 are discussed in sec.[section : def ] .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.[section : conclusions ] .",
    "we study the hpsts @xcite among nodes of the spin 1/2 chain in strong external magnetic field @xmath82 with the @xmath81 hamiltonian @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath85 is the distance between @xmath6th and @xmath10th spins , @xmath86 is the projection operator of the @xmath6th spin on the @xmath87 axis , @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the @xmath90-projection operator of the total spin , @xmath91 are the spin - spin coupling constants .",
    "this hamiltonian describes the secular part of the dipole - dipole interaction in the strong external magnetic field @xcite . for our convenience , we call @xmath92 , @xmath93",
    ". it is obvious that all @xmath94 may be arbitrary by definition .",
    "although the approximation of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) by the nearest neighbour interaction is very popular in study of the quantum state transfer , one can show that it is not applicable to the inhomogeneous chains which have a wide spread of coupling constants .",
    "in fact , this approximation is applicable if @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xmath97 . only in this case",
    "we may disregard terms with coupling constants @xmath91 ( @xmath97 ) in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , this is not possible in general .",
    "consider , for instance , the chain in fig.[fig : chain ] .    in this chain",
    ", the approximation by the nearest neighbour interaction takes into account the term with coupling constant @xmath98 and disregards the term with coupling constant @xmath99 in the hamiltonian , i.e. we neglect the term which is bigger then the term which is taken into account .",
    "@xmath100 the approximation by the nearest neighbour interaction requires , in particular , @xmath101 however , we see that the second condition is not satisfied for the case shown in fig.[fig : chain ] .",
    "comparison of the coupling constants in the chains considered in secs.[section:4n]-[section : def ] confirms that the approximation of the hamiltonian by the nearest neighbour interaction is not applicable to these chains .",
    "thus , hereafter we consider the total hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to take the eigenvectors of @xmath89 as the basis of the matrix representation of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this is possible since the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) commutes with @xmath89 : @xmath102=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that both @xmath103 and @xmath89 have the common set of eigenvectors . in general the dimensionality of the matrix representation of the hamiltonian",
    "is @xmath78 . as usual , we write the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath89 in terms of the dirac notations .",
    "let latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is @xmath79 identity matrix .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath78 matrix representation of the hamiltonian we have @xmath79 block @xmath112 and scalar block @xmath111 , which significantly reduces all calculations .",
    "it was shown @xcite that effectiveness of the quantum communication channel may be measured by the fidelities of the state transfers between @xmath56th and @xmath57th nodes : @xmath115 where the amplitudes @xmath116 and the phases @xmath117 are defined as follows ( @xmath118 ) : @xmath119 here @xmath120 , @xmath121 , are components of the eigenvector @xmath122 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath123 of the matrix @xmath124 : @xmath125 .",
    "the effectiveness of the state transfer is characterized by the set of parameters @xmath126 , @xmath118 .",
    "it is evident , that these parameters take maximum values if @xmath127 which may be considered as the system of equation defining ( not uniquely ) the time dependence @xmath128 ( which must be positive over the interval @xmath129 ) : @xmath130 then the values of the fidelities @xmath131 are defined by @xmath132 or , equivalently , by the probabilities @xmath53 .",
    "for this reason , namely probabilities @xmath53 will be studied in the rest of this paper .",
    "phases @xmath133 ( which are independent on @xmath128 ) will be taken as parameters of the hpst@xmath68 instead of the parameters @xmath134 in the set ( [ parametershpst ] ) , see tables 1 - 6 .",
    "remark that , deriving eqs.([f_nm]-[varphi ] ) we took into account that the energy of the ground state @xmath135 is not zero : @xmath136 .",
    "an explicite example of the function @xmath128 constructed in accordance with eqs.([gamma_b ] ) with @xmath137 will be given in sec.[section:4n ] , see example 1 .",
    "[ section:4n ] the hpsts from the end node to ( some of ) the inner nodes of the spin chain becomes possible due to the following mechanism .",
    "let us take two identical chains @xmath138 which allow the hpst between their end nodes .",
    "let @xmath139 be the minimal coupling constant between the nearest neighbours in these chains .",
    "we connect these chains by the weak bond with the coupling constant @xmath140 , resulting in the chain @xmath141 of @xmath142 nodes , see fig.[fig : d2_4n ]",
    ".    then @xmath143 these hpsts may be understood as follows .",
    "let spin @xmath144 be directed opposite to the external magnetic field while all other spins of the chain @xmath141 be directed along the field initially .",
    "due to the small coupling constant @xmath145 this excited state remains inside of the first chain @xmath146 for the long time with the high probability to be detected in either @xmath144 or @xmath147 ( since , by definition , the chain @xmath146 provides hpst between end nodes ) .",
    "however , due to the bond between two chains @xmath146 , the excited state will be transfered to the second chain @xmath138 after comparatively long time interval @xmath148 with the high probability .",
    "if this happens , than the excited state remains in this chain for the long time with high probability to be detected in either @xmath149 or @xmath150 .",
    "similarly , after one more time interval @xmath148 the excited state will return to the first chain @xmath138 with the high probability , and so on",
    ". parameter @xmath145 may be fixed by the two conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) . hereafter in this section we take @xmath66 in the definition ( [ hpst ] ) .",

    "the simplest example of the chain @xmath146 providing the ideal end - to - end state transfer is the chain of two nodes , i.e. @xmath152 . connecting two equivalent chains @xmath138 we obtain the chain @xmath151 with @xmath137 , see fig.[fig : d3_4n_ex1 ] .    in this case",

    "otherwise the time interval @xmath168 becomes very long . to decrease this time interval",
    "we suggest the following modification of the chain @xmath141 .",
    "let us take a symmetrical chain @xmath169 of @xmath170 nodes with maximal coupling constant between neighbours @xmath171 satisfying the following condition : @xmath172 . using the coupling constant @xmath173 we may construct the chain @xmath174 of @xmath175 nodes shown in fig.[fig : d5_4n_mod ] .    here",
