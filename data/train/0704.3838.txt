    "current solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very convincing evidence that neutrinos have non - vanishing rest masses and their mixing involves two large angles ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and one small angle ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these important results indicate that the standard electroweak model , in which the gauge group is @xmath3 and three neutrinos are massless weyl particles , is actually incomplete .",
    "there are many possibilities of extending the standard model to accommodate massive neutrinos and to resolve or soften other potential problems of the model itself @xcite .",
    "one of them , motivated by the conjecture that parity is a perfect symmetry at high - energy scales and is spontaneously broken at low - energy scales , is the left - right symmetric model @xcite .",
    "the elegance of this model and its testability at the lhc and ilc experiments have recently been iterated @xcite .",
    "the left - right symmetric model is based on the gauge group @xmath4 , and thus it naturally contains both left - handed and right - handed neutrinos together with one higgs bi - doublet @xmath5 and two higgs triplets @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the left - right gauge symmetry , a discrete left - right symmetry may be introduced into the model by requiring its invariance under @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the gauge - invariant yukawa interactions between the fermion and higgs sectors can be written as @xmath11 + { \\rm h.c . } \\ ; , % ----------------(1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the charge - conjugation matrix .",
    "as a consequence of the discrete left - right symmetry , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are both symmetric matrices .",
    "note that @xmath17 is spontaneously broken into the standard - model gauge group @xmath3 via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath18 , and then the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is accomplished through the vev of @xmath5 .",
    "given the vevs of @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath20 the up - type quark , down - type quark , charged lepton and dirac neutrino mass matrices are @xmath21 meanwhile , the left- and right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrices can be obtained from the corresponding mass terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) once the higgs triplets @xmath19 and @xmath18 acquire their vevs : @xmath22 and @xmath23 . integrating out the heavy particles ( i.e. , the right - handed majorana neutrinos and the higgs triplets ) , one obtains the effective mass matrix for three light ( left - handed ) majorana neutrinos via the type - ii seesaw relation @xcite : @xmath24 the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing , which has clearly shown up in both solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , arises from the mismatch between the diagonalizations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . on the other hand , it is possible to interpret the cosmological baryon number asymmetry @xmath27 @xcite with the help of the thermal leptogenesis mechanism @xcite : either through the out - of - equilibrium decay of the lightest right - handed majorana neutrino , or via the out - of - equilibrium decay of one or more higgs triplets @xcite , or due to both effects .",
    "the left - right symmetric model is therefore an intriguing playground to explore new physics beyond the standard model , at least in the neutrino sector .",
    "however , it is a highly non - trivial task to simultaneously account for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry and current neutrino oscillation data in the left - right symmetric model .",
    "the reason is simply that the specific textures of @xmath25 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not fixed by the model itself . to get around this difficulty",
    ", one may impose certain flavor symmetries or empirical assumptions on those mass matrices such that their textures can be ( partly ) determined or constrained .",
    "such a phenomenological strategy has been adopted in some recent attempts @xcite to study neutrino mixing and leptogenesis based on the left - right symmetry , although not all of them are successful in fitting the updated observational @xcite and experimental @xcite data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose two novel and viable scenarios for @xmath28 and @xmath30 in the flavor basis where @xmath25 is diagonal , so as to simultaneously interpret the observed neutrino mixing pattern and the observed baryon number asymmetry of the universe in the left - right symmetric model .",
    "a salient feature of both scenarios is that the higgs triplet yukawa coupling matrix takes the friedberg - lee ( fl ) texture @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33 identity matrix .",
    "such a texture is phenomenologically appealing for two simple reasons : ( 1 ) @xmath29 can be diagonalized by a unitarity transformation whose form is very close to the interesting tri - bimaximal mixing pattern @xcite ; and ( 2 ) the inverse matrix of @xmath30 , which appears in the seesaw formula , has a structure exactly parallel to @xmath29 .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain the nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix , which is particularly favored by current neutrino oscillation data , from the type - ii seesaw relation under a suitable condition .",
    "the complex phases of @xmath30 turn out to be the common source of cp violation for neutrino oscillations and baryogenesis via leptogenesis , if the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath28 is real . to be specific",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath34 is diagonal and real in scenario ( a ) , and @xmath28 is real and has a similar fl texture in scenario ( b ) .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that both scenarios are viable in the left - right symmetric model to account for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry and the neutrino mixing data .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we diagonalize the fl texture and describe the picture of leptogenesis as the preliminaries .",
    "sections iii and iv are devoted to the details of scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the consequences of both scenarios on neutrino mixing and leptogenesis are also illustrated in these two sections .",
    "a summary of our main results is given in section v.",
    "in this section , we first describe a generic diagonalization of the fl texture and then outline a couple of basic formulas to be used for the calculation of leptogenesis",
    ".      the symmetric matrix @xmath30 in eq . ( 5 ) can be diagonalized by the transformation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is unitary and @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) are real and positive .",
    "the special texture of @xmath29 guarantees @xmath36 to take the form @xmath39 where the leading term is just the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern @xcite , and the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 } { { \\rm re}\\left [ \\left ( a^ * + d^ * \\right ) \\left ( b - c \\right ) \\right ] + |b|^2-|c|^2 } \\ ; , %        ( 7)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 without loss of generality , one may rotate away @xmath48 through the redefinitions @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath36 contains three non - trivial phase parameters : @xmath41 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath22 and @xmath53 hold in the left - right symmetric model , their mass eigenvalues can be given in terms of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 obtained in eq .",
    "for example , three heavy right - handed majorana neutrino masses are simply @xmath57 ( for @xmath38 ) .      for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that three heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos have a normal mass hierarchy ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) and their masses are much smaller than the masses of higgs triplets . in this case only the cp - violating asymmetry generated from the out - of - equilibrium decay of the lightest right - handed majorana neutrino can survive and contribute to the thermal leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "such a cp - violating asymmetry , denoted as @xmath59 , arises from the interference between the tree - level and one - loop decay amplitudes . in the basis where @xmath60 is diagonal and real , @xmath59 is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62}{\\left(\\hat m_d^\\dagger \\hat m^{}_d\\right)^{}_{11 } } \\sqrt{x^{}_j } \\left [ \\frac{2 - x^{}_j}{1 - x^{}_j } - \\left(1 + x^{}_j\\right ) \\ln{\\frac{x^{}_j + 1}{x^{}_j } } \\right ] \\ ;",

    "the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath59 can give rise to a net lepton number asymmetry in the universe , and the nonperturbative sphaleron interaction may partially convert this lepton number asymmetry into a net baryon number asymmetry @xcite , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an efficiency factor measuring the washout effects associated with the out - of - equilibrium decay of the lightest right - handed majorana neutrino .",

    "the most salient feature of our scenarios is that the higgs triplet yukawa coupling matrix @xmath30 takes the intriguing friedberg - lee texture . in the basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath25 is diagonal , the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath28 has been assumed to be identical to @xmath25 in scenario ( a ) and to take the fl texture in scenario ( b ) .",
    "we have shown that the nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern , which is particularly favored by current neutrino oscillation data , can be naturally derived from both scenarios . requiring the lightest right - handed majorana neutrino mass @xmath146 to be above @xmath217 gev",
    ", we have demonstrated the parameter space of each scenario in which the cosmological baryon number asymmetry can be interpreted via the flavor - independent leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that some of the assumptions made for the above type - ii seesaw scenarios are just for the sake of simplicity .",
    "hence they are not demanded in more general cases .",
    "for example , one may discuss the flavor - dependent thermal leptogenesis to account for the observed baryon number asymmetry of the universe by allowing @xmath146 to be below @xmath217 gev @xcite .",
    "one may also allow all the parameters of @xmath29 to be complex and independent , in order to generate an experimentally appreciable value for the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath169 and to give rise to the observable effect of cp violation in neutrino oscillations . in this sense",
    "we conclude that our scenarios , which are associated with the left - right gauge symmetry and its spontaneous breaking as well as the fl flavor symmetry and its explicit breaking , have very rich implications and consequences in neutrino phenomenology .",
