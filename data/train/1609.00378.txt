    "the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) is one of the main scaling relations for rotationally supported galaxies , describing an empirical correlation between the luminosity or visible mass of a spiral galaxy and its rotational velocity or dynamical mass @xcite .",
    "numerous observational studies of the statistical properties of the tfr have been undertaken in the past .",
    "generally , their aim was to find observables that reduce the scatter in the relation , and thus improve the distance measure to spiral galaxies .",
    "an accurate distance measure is necessary to address some of the main cosmological questions pertaining to the local universe , such as the value of the hubble constant , the local large  scale structure and the local cosmic flow field , e.g. @xcite , hereafter .",
    "use of the implied scaling law and understanding its origin is one of the main challenges for theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular the detailed statistical properties of the tfr provide important constraints to semi  analytical models and numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is an important test for theoretical studies to reproduce the slope , scatter and the zero point of the tfr in different photometric bands simultaneously .",
    "recent cosmological simulations of galaxy formation have reached sufficient maturity to construct sufficiently realistic galaxies that follow the observed tfr @xcite .    an important outstanding issue",
    ", however , is how to connect the results from simulations to the multitude of observational studies , which often do not agree with each other @xcite .",
    "moreover , while performing these comparison tests , it is important to ensure that the galaxy parameters derived from simulations and observations have the same physical meaning .",
    "for example , for simulated galaxies the circular velocity of a galaxy is usually derived from the potential of the dark matter halo , while the observed velocity , based on the width of the global hi profile obtained with single  dish telescopes , is a good representation for the dark matter halo potential only in rather limited cases .",
    "note that the rotational velocity of a galaxy , inferred from the width of its global hi profile , can be directly related to the dark matter potential only when the gas is in co ",
    "planar , circular orbits and the rotation curve has reached the turnover to a constant velocity at radii properly sampled by the gas disk . however ,",
    "this is often not the case as galaxies display a variety of rotation curves shapes , which can not be characterised with a single parameter such as the corrected width of the global hi line profile .",
    "furthermore , the number of observational studies that take into account the two  dimensional distribution of hi and the detailed geometry and kinematics of a galaxy s disk is rather limited .    with the developments of new methods and instruments , the observed scatter in the tully - fisher relation",
    "has decreased significantly , mainly due to more accurate photometric measurements .",
    "photographic magnitudes @xcite were improved upon by ccd photometry .",
    "the advent of infra  red arrays shifted photometry to the jhk bands , minimizing extinction corrections , and then to space  based infra  red photometry with the spitzer space telescope @xcite , which better samples the older stellar population and maximizes photometric calibration stability . as was shown by @xcite , the measurement errors on the total @xmath0 luminosity are reduced to a point where they no longer contribute significantly to the observed scatter in the tully  fisher relation .",
    "hence , other measurement errors , such as uncertainties on a galaxy s inclination and/or rotational velocity , combined with a certain intrinsic scatter are responsible for the total observed scatter .    ]",
    "it was shown by @xcite , with a study of nearly equidistant spiral galaxies in the ursa major cluster with deep kband photometry , that the observed scatter in the tully  fisher relation can be reduced significantly when the measured velocity of the outer , flat part of the hi rotation curve ( v@xmath1 ) is used instead of the rotational velocity as estimated from the width of the global hi profile .",
    "indeed , the spatially - resolved , two  dimensional velocity fields of gas disks , obtained with radio interferometric arrays , often reveal the presence of warps , streaming motions and kinematic lopsidedness of the gas disks , while the global hi profiles do not allow the identification of such features .",
    "therefore , the width of a global hi line profile , albeit easily obtained with a single  dish telescope , may not be an accurate representation of v@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the analysis of spatially resolved hi kinematics shows that the rotation curves of spiral galaxies are not always flat and featureless .",
    "rotation curves may still be rising at the outermost observable edge of the gas disk , in which case the width of the global hi profile provides a lower limit on v@xmath1 .",
    "rotation curves may also be declining beyond an initial turnover radius , in which case v@xmath1 derived from the rotation curve is systematically lower than the circular velocity derived from the corrected width of the global hi profile . in this paper , we investigate the differences between three measures of the rotational velocity of spiral galaxies : the rotational velocity from the corrected width of the global hi profile , the maximal rotation velocity of the rotation curve ( v@xmath2 ) and the rotational velocity of the outer flat part of the rotation curve ( v@xmath1 ) .",
    "the effects of these different velocity measures on the observed scatter and the intrinsic properties of the tfr will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "to derive v@xmath2 and v@xmath1 we analyse in detail the hi synthesis imaging data for a tully - fisher calibrator sample of 32 nearby , well  resolved galaxies and present these data in the form of an atlas and tables .",
    "we will discuss the identification and corrections made for warps and streaming motions in the gas disks when deriving the hi rotation curves .",
    "forthcoming papers will use these data to investigate the luminosity  based tfr using panchromatic photometric data , as well as the baryonic tfr for the same calibrator sample .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section 2 describes the sample of selected galaxies .",
    "section 3 presents the data collection and analysis , including subsections on the comparison between the rotational velocities obtained from the rotation curves and the corrected width of the global hi profiles .",
    "section 4 presents the properties of the gaseous disks of the sample galaxies . a summary and concluding remarks are presented in section 5 .",
    "the atlas is described in the appendix , together with notes on individual galaxies .",

    "density maps were created by adding the primary beam corrected , non  zero emission channels of the cleaned data cubes with applied masks .",
    "the pixel values in the resulting map were converted from flux density units @xmath3 $ ] to column  densities @xmath4 @xmath5 $ ] , according to the formula :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the brightness temperature and @xmath8 is the velocity width over which the emission was integrated .",

    "subsequently the conversion from @xmath4 @xmath5 $ ] to @xmath15 $ ] was applied :    @xmath16 = 1.249 \\times 10^{20 } [ atoms \\ , cm^{-2 } ] .\\ ] ]    the hi column  density maps and the radial , face  on surface density profiles are presented in the atlas while the azimuthally averaged peak column  density of each galaxy is listed in table [ tbl_param ] .",
    "in this section we investigate the global properties of the gas disks of our sample galaxies and compare these to the same properties of galaxies in the volume  limited ursa major sample @xcite and the sample of @xcite . although our sample of tully  fisher calibrator galaxies is by no means statistically complete , it is important to demonstrate that our sample is not biased and representative of late  type galaxies , at least from an hi perspective .",
    "the main properties of the hi gas disks of our galaxies are listed in table [ tbl_param ] .",

    "we investigate whether the galaxies in our sample adhere to this tight correlation .",

    "next , we measure the diameters of the hi disks",
    ". we do not measure @xmath22 from the hi maps , which are often irregular in their outer regions .",
    "instead , we measure the hi radius as the radius where the azimuthally  averaged , face  on hi surface  density has dropped to @xmath23 .    the @xmath24 versus @xmath22 correlation for our sample galaxies is shown in figure [ fig_dhi ] .",
    "the solid line illustrates a linear fit and can be described as :    @xmath25    with a rms scatter of 0.13 .",
    "the dashed and dashed  dot lines correspond to the relations found by @xcite and by @xcite , respectively .",
    "we find an insignificantly shallower slope for this correlation which may be due to a relatively small number of intrinsically small galaxies in our sample .",
    "it is well known that hi masses and @xmath26 ratios of galaxies correlate well with the luminosity and morphological type of a galaxy .",
    "our galaxy sample is not an exception and shows good agreement with previous studies @xcite . in our work",
    "we consider the hi masses and @xmath27 ratios , and compare the trends observed in our sample with the volume  limited sample of ursa major galaxies @xcite for which deep @xmath28 photometry is available and obtained in a similar fashion as for our sample galaxies , as will be discussed in a fortcoming paper .",
    "correlations of the total hi mass and the hi mass  to  light ratio with @xmath29 and the morphological types of the galaxies are shown in figure [ fig_mlt ] . the light ",
    "gray symbols correspond to galaxies in the ursa major reference sample .",
    "we see that our sample galaxies follow the same known correlations with a similar scatter as the reference sample .",
    "the upper  left panel of figure [ fig_mlt ] shows that more luminous galaxies tend to contain more hi gas ( pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath30 ) , while the lower  left panel shows that the hi mass  to  light ratio decreases with luminosity ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the upper  right panel of figure [ fig_mlt ] illustrates that a weaker trend exists between a galaxy s hi mass and its hubble type , both for our sample galaxies ( @xmath32 ) and the ursa major reference sample ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the lower ",
    "right panel of figure [ fig_mlt ] , however , presents a strong correlation between hi mass  to  light ratio and hubble type with later  type galaxies containing more gas per unit luminosity ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we conclude that the galaxies in our tfr calibrator sample are representative of normal field galaxies as found in a volume  limited sample .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig_ttype ] , our sample covers a broad range of morphological types from @xmath35 to irregular .",
    "we divide our sample into five bins of morphological types @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 and investigate possible difference between the hi surface density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types .",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial hi surface ",
    "density profiles , normalised to their peak values and their hi diameters , are presented in figure [ fig_profs ] .",
    "clearly the shapes and amplitudes of the profiles are very diverse , and can not be described with a uniform profile , in disagreement with the results by @xcite for the disk ",
    "mass sample which is dominated by @xmath41type galaxies .",
    "although there is a large variety in profile shapes , we confirm the overall trend that early  type spiral galaxies tend to have central holes in their hi disks while late  type and irregular galaxies tend to have central concentrations of hi gas .",
    "the gas disks of spiral galaxies of intermediate morphological types have a more constant surface  density or may show mild central depressions in their surface",
    "we have presented the analysis of 21-cm spectral  line aperture synthesis observations of 32 spiral galaxies , which are representing a calibrator sample for studying the statistical properties of the tully  fisher relation .",
    "the data were collected mostly from the literature and obtained with various observational facilities ( vla , atca , wsrt ) .",
    "we observed for the first time three galaxies in our sample ourselves with the gmrt .",
    "the most important aspect of this work is that , despite the broad range in data quality , we analysed the entire sample in the same manner .",
    "although previously many of these galaxies were studied individually , we present for the first time a set of hi synthesis imaging data products for all these galaxies together , analysed in a homogeneous way .",
    "the data products consist of total hi maps , velocity fields in which asymmetric velocity profiles are identified and removed , hi global profiles , radial hi surface  density profiles , position  velocity diagrams and , most importantly , high  quality extended hi rotation curves , all presented in an accompanying atlas .",
    "the rotation curves and the derived measurements of v@xmath2 and v@xmath1 will be used in forthcoming papers investigating the statistical properties of the tully  fisher relation . the radial hi surface ",
    "density profiles will be used for rotation curves decompositions , aimed at studying the mass distributions within spiral galaxies .",
    "overall , our kinematical study of the gas disks of our sample galaxies shows excellent agreement with previously reported values for the position and inclination angles , and systemic velocities .",
    "we find a good agreement with literature values for both hi fluxes and the widths of the global hi profiles at the 50% level , obtained from single  dish observations .",
    "however , in some cases we find somewhat larger fluxes than previously reported in the literature ( see section 3.3.1 for details ) .",
    "this can be easily explained given the large angular size of our galaxies , and the fact that single  dish observations can miss some flux due to the relatively small beam sizes .",
    "all galaxies in our sample have extended hi disks , which serve our purpose to probe the gravitational potential of their dark matter halos . moreover , our galaxies follow the well  known correlation between their hi mass and the diameter of their hi disks , but with a slightly shallower slope then shown in previous studies .",
    "studies of the hi mass and its correlation with the absolute @xmath28 magnitude show that while more luminous galaxies tend to have more hi gas , its fraction decreases with luminosity .",
    "we find hints for similar trends with hubble  type : late  type spiral galaxies tend to have a larger fraction of hi gas than more early  type spirals , but the total mass of the hi gas decreases .",
    "a qualitative comparison with the volume  limited sample of ursa major galaxies shows that our calibrator sample is respresenatative for a population of field galaxies .    the radial hi surface ",
    "density profiles were scaled radially with @xmath42 and divided into five groups according to the morphological type of the galaxies .",
    "the gas disks of early  type spirals tend to have central holes while the has disks of late  type spirals and irregulars tend to be centrally concentrated .",
    "velocity fields were constructed by fitting gaussian and gauss  hermite polynomial functions to the velocity profile at each position in the data cube .",
    "we identified the pixels with skewed velocity profiles , using the difference between these two velocity fields , and censored them in the gaussian velocity field , thereby creating a third type of velocity field .",
    "rotation curves were derived from these censored velocity fields using tilted  ring modelling .",
    "the procedure was done in four steps , which allowed to follow the geometry of a possible warp in the outer region .",
    "rotation curves were identified into 3 categories : rising , flat and declining .",
    "the obtained values of v@xmath2 and v@xmath1 were compared with the velocities derived from the corrected hi global profiles at the 50% and 20% level .",
    "the comparison tests show that while the width of the hi profile can be a good representation for the maximal rotation velocity of the galaxy , it may significantly overestimate the velocity at the outer , flat part of the rotation curve , especially for high  mass galaxies which tend to have declining rotation curves . for the rising rotation curves , where v@xmath2 is lower than v@xmath1",
    ", the width of the profile tends to underestimate v@xmath1 .",
    "the statistical properties of the tully - fisher relation based on different velocity measures ( @xmath43 , v@xmath2 and v@xmath1 ) will be studied in forthcoming papers .",
