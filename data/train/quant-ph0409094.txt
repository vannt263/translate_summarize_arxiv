    "it seems reasonable to state that at present , only about half of the laws of physics are understood ; whilst we know very well how to predict the outcome probabilities of given quantum experiments , we have no idea as to why we find ourselves doing those experiments in the first place .",
    "in other words , we do not have a proper theory of the universe considered as a fully autonomous , self - referential quantum dynamical system .    in 1983",
    ", feynman wrote a paper on the simulation of physics with computers @xcite . towards the end of the paper , he wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` ... we have an illusion that we can do any experiment that we want .",

    "have come from a certain past . ''",

    "first , feynman s paper explores the notion that the laws of physics , if not the universe as a whole , might be describable in terms of computation . because of quantum mechanics , however , feynman recognized that the computation involved could not be classical but has to involve what is now known as quantum computing .",
    "secondly , and this comes as a surprise considering the pragmatic nature of feynman s lifetime contributions to quantum theory , feynman seems to be advocating the study of _ endophysics _ as opposed to _ exophysics . _ briefly , endophysics is physics described from within , whilst exophysics is physics described from the point of view of external observers looking into systems under observation .",
    "the latter approach to physics has been very successful ever since the time of newton whilst the former remains a deep theoretical challenge .    given the success of exophysics , it seems at first sight unreasonable to consider replacing it with an intractable alternative .",
    "however , there are no signs that quantum mechanics has any natural boundaries . on the contrary ,",
    "there is increasing evidence for the applicability of quantum principles at scales much greater than the atomic .",
    "the hypothetical line between the classical and quantum worlds has been called the `` heisenberg cut ''",
    ". it does not seem to exist .",
    "sooner or later , we shall be forced to understand the dynamics of observers in a more fundamental way , not just the dynamics of the systems that those observers are looking at .",
    "given that we have been motivated to think of how observers and their measuring apparatus evolve dynamically , we are faced with the challenge of finding a dynamical description for them on a par with the quantum description we have for systems under observation , such as the schrdinger equation .",
    "we are a long way from having anything like that , and it is possible that such a goal might never be achieved . however , ruling out such a possibility as a matter of principle seems a recipe for complacency , and besides , could be a serious mistake .    in this paper , therefore , we attempt to bring into a quantum framework a greater role for the physical apparatus involved in quantum experiments than is usual",
    ". it will be evident , after reading our quantum register description of experiments , what the limitations of our approach are .",
    "we present no theory as to why experiments are done , but a start is made to bring into the discussion some aspects involved in real quantum physics experiments which generally have not been modelled in conventional approaches .",
    "quantum register physics has the potential to describe situations where not only might physical apparatus change in time , but also those situations where many independent or coupled quantum experiments are being conducted simultaneously .",
    "what is presented in this paper provides a consistent quantum computational framework for the description of simple and complex experiments , such as the stern - gerlach experiment , the mach - zender interferometer , experiments conventionally requiring a povm description , and epr -type experiments .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "first we review the notions of quantum bits and quantum registers .",
    "then we start to discuss more and more complex experiments from the point of view of quantum registers .",
    "our aim here is to show how real physics experiments can be successfully modelled in a novel way which holds some promise of bringing physical apparatus into quantum discussions .",
    "finally , we shall discuss some of the conceptual ramifications of quantum register physics .",
    "a _ classical bit _ @xmath0 is a system with two possible states : @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "we may represent these states by the two - dimensional real column vectors @xmath4 , \\;\\;\\;|0)\\equiv \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] and their duals @xmath5 , @xmath6 by the row vectors @xmath7 , \\;\\;\\;(0|\\equiv \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] .\\ ] ] then we have the orthonormality condition @xmath8 for  any @xmath9 in the set @xmath10    given that @xmath11 is a classical bit state , but with no other information , we may write@xmath12 where @xmath13 are in the set @xmath14 and @xmath15 for a classical bit , there are only two possible sets of values for @xmath16 , viz . , @xmath17 or else @xmath18 .",
    "we turn a classical bit into a qubit ( quantum bit ) by regarding the classical bit states @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 as the basis vectors _ _  _ _ for a 2-dimensional hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "these basis vectors will be referred to as the _ computational basis_.    a general normalized qubit state is given by @xmath22 where  now @xmath23 , @xmath24 are allowed to be complex and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath15 here @xmath6 and @xmath5 are the vectors dual to @xmath25 and @xmath20 respectively and form the computational basis for the dual qubit hilbert space @xmath26 .",
    "for a given qubit @xmath21 , we define the following operators :    [ [ i - the - projection - operators ] ] * i ) the projection operators : *    @xmath27    [ [ ii - the - transition - operators ] ] ii ) * the transition operators * :    @xmath28    [ [ iii - the - identity - operator ] ] * iii ) the identity operator : *    @xmath29    [ [ iv - the - pauli - operators ] ] * iv ) the pauli operators : *    @xmath30    all of these operators apart from @xmath31 can be defined for classical bits . also , all of these operators can be multiplied together and form a closed algebra , represented by table 1 .",
    "for example , the product @xmath32 is found by the intersection of the row labelled by @xmath33 and the column labelled by @xmath34 . from the table , we find @xmath35 , the zero operator .",
    "this table turns out to be invaluable in quantum register physics .",

    "@xmath66 we can read off the following fundamental property of the transition operators : @xmath67 which at first sight suggests that these operators are related to fermionic or grassmannian variables .",
    "however , qubits are neither spin - half fermions nor grassmannian variables @xcite , but they can be used in the manner of jordan and wigner @xcite to construct fermionic quantum fields out of large collections ( quantum registers ) of qubits .",
    "the nilpotency property ( [ aaa ] ) of the transition operators gives quantum register physics a very particular flavour , modelling the fact that a real physics apparatus is either void ( is not being used ) or else can `` hold '' only one state at a time .",
    "a rank-@xmath68 quantum register @xmath69 is the tensor product of @xmath68 distinct , labelled qubits : @xmath70 it is a complex hilbert space of dimension @xmath71 , containing _",
    "separable _ and _ entangled _ states .",
    "this makes it ideal for discussing quantum physics .    in the following , the left - right ordering of tensor products is not significant , although labels are significant .",
    "for example , the rank-@xmath72 quantum registers @xmath73 and @xmath74 are equivalent .",
    "a _ register computational basis _",
    "@xmath75 is readily constructed by tensoring the computational bases for all of the qubits in the register in the following manner : @xmath76 in our work , we shall always denote qubit and register states by dirac bra - ket notation , modified by the replacement of angular brackets @xmath77 with round brackets @xmath78 respectively .",
    "elements of the register computational basis @xmath75 can be represented in a number of equivalent ways , depending on context , as follows :    1 .",
    "we can drop the tensor product symbol , as the individual qubit identifier labels suffice to carry the necessary information : @xmath79 with orthonormality condition @xmath80    for example , for a rank-@xmath81 quantum register , the element @xmath82 register , we have the state @xmath83 in such cases , we shall always give the decimal representation the subscript @xmath84 , to denote `` base ten '' , and then we know that @xmath85 and not @xmath86 .",
    "whenever there is no possible ambiguity , we shall not need this subscript and so leave it out .",
    "an arbitrary quantum register state @xmath11 can always be expressed in terms of the register computational basis , i.e. , @xmath87 then the inner product between any two elements @xmath11 , @xmath88 of the register is given by @xmath89    we are now ready to discuss real quantum physics experiments .",
    "in 1922 , stern and gerlach performed an experiment , passing electrons through a strong , inhomogeneous magnetic field @xcite . their apparatus is represented in figure 1 .",
    "= 3.0 in    in the conventional hilbert space description of this experiment , an electron state evolves from an initial state @xmath90 to a final state @xmath91 which can be represented as the linear superposition of two possible outcome states , known as `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' respectively .",
    "each of these states is associated with one of the outcome spots shown in figure 1 .",
    "these outcomes are represented by the orthonormalized kets @xmath92up@xmath93 and @xmath92down@xmath93 respectively : @xmath94 the statistical results of the experiment are in agreement with the quantum theory born probability rule @xmath95    our quantum register description of this and other experiments rests on several observations about what happens in such experiments .",
    "first , in most real physics experiment , all parts of the apparatus exist before , during and after the experiment .",
    "normally , many individuals runs or repetitions of such an experiment are performed , generally spaced over a significant interval of time and , during this time , the apparatus maintains a temporally enduring identity .",
    "we shall model this aspect of the physics in our quantum register description .",
    "second , for the stern - gerlach experiment illustrated in figure @xmath66 , the two outcome possibilities for each emerging electron are detected at _ different _ spatial locations ( of course , in any single run involving a single electron passing through the apparatus , the electron is detected at only one of these two places at the end of that run ) .",
    "this spatial separation is crucial to the success of the experiment , for without it , stern and gerlach would never have been able to observe anything unusual .",
    "this aspect of detection is also modelled in our quantum register physics .",
    "third , it is possible to have more than one stern - gerlach experiment being performed simultaneously in different parts of the world .",
    "the quantum register description permits us to describe such a scenario using a single large quantum register .",
    "the essence of the quantum register description of the stern - gerlach and other experiments is to assign a qubit to each place where physicists could in principle detect new information .",
    "this is equivalent to using the _ space _ concept in a counterfactual way . for the stern - gerlach experiment ,",
    "this means assigning at least three qubits as follows :    \\1 ) we assign a qubit @xmath96 to the source of the electrons ;    \\2 ) we assign a qubit @xmath97 to the _ up _ state detector ;    \\3 ) we assign a qubit @xmath98 to the _ down _ state detector .",
    "this assignment is represented in figure 2 :    = 3.0 in    points to note are    1 .   unlike the conventional description of the stern - gerlach experiment , states @xmath92up@xmath93 and @xmath92down@xmath93 are _",
    "not _ regarded as orthogonal qubit states in the same qubit space ; 2 .",
    "we include the source in the description ; 3 .",
    "in principle we could imagine the physical space between source and detectors as filled with qubits , but these would be redundant here .",
    "we need only that number of qubits sufficient to model the essential physics of a given experiment .",
    "later on in this paper we shall discuss quantum register cosmology and quantum register field theory , where there is a reason to consider space in terms of a very large ( possibly infinite ) rank quantum register .",
    "having set up a rank - three quantum register  @xmath99 to model the stern - gerlach experiment , we now discuss a typical run of this experiment .",
    "this involves a time - dependent description of the state @xmath100 of the combined apparatus - system .",
    "first , imagine the situation _ after _ all apparatus has been constructed but before the actual experiment has started . during such a time , the equipment is lying idle , i.e. , unused .",
    "it exists , but no electron is being prepared and no detector is registering any result .",
    "such a state of the apparatus - laboratory system will be called the _ void _ state ( we shall not use the term @xmath101 in this context , as this will be reserved for other specific situations ) .",
    "we shall represent the void state by the quantum register vector @xmath102    suppose now that the experiment has started . at some initial time",
    "@xmath103 , the experimentalists will be confident that the source has prepared an initial state , but nothing has yet been registered by either detector .",
    "we represent the lab - state ( our terminology for the state of the apparatus and system ) by the quantum register state @xmath104 where in this particular case @xmath105 note that we can be sure that there must be such an interval of time , because the detectors are spatially separated from the source , and therefore could only trigger a non - zero time _ after _ state preparation , according to the principles of special relativity . it does not matter that according to some quantum theorists , quantum states change instantaneously .",
    "this is irrelevant in quantum register physics .",
    "all signals registered in our qubits have to be consistent with relativity .    finally , at a time @xmath106 , we may write down the lab - state immediately prior to detection : @xmath107 where @xmath108 once we have determined @xmath109 the born probability rule adapted to the quantum register can be applied to give the outcome probabilities @xmath110 consistent with known physics .",
    "of course , during any single run involving a single electron , only one detector gets triggered , so these probabilities have to be related to the frequencies of outcome built up over many runs of the basic experiment .",
    "normally , after each run is over and before the next one starts , the lab - state reverts to the void state @xmath19 .",
    "the specific mechanism for this is currently beyond known physics , as is the transition from the void state to the initial state at the start of a run .",
    "our quantum register approach permits a very interesting and physically meaningful situation to be contemplated .",
    "we could imagine starting the @xmath111 run _ before _ the _ _  _ _ @xmath112 is complete .",
    "such a situation would be modelled , for example , by the sequence @xmath113 we shall discuss this and other exotic possibilities in @xmath114 .",
    "more formally , we may consider changes in the lab - state to be described by unitary evolution over @xmath115 , viz .",
    ", @xmath116 where @xmath117 is unitary so as to preserve total probability . exactly what this operator is or should be will not always be clear , because physics experiments will not in general deal with absolutely every possible state in a quantum register .",
    "the basic stern - gerlach experiment , for example , requires us only to consider four of the eight computational basis elements , viz , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for such basic systems",
    ", there is a degree of overkill in the quantum register description .",
    "this should not be regarded as a flaw ; a similar situation occurs in most classical and quantum theories .",
    "we can be sure of one or two things , however .",
    "first , if the laboratory is in a void state , then we do not expect that to change , unless we initiate a new run ( which will not conserve probability anyway ) .",
    "therefore , we may assume @xmath120 then we can represent the dynamics in terms of how the transition operators change , viz .",
    ", @xmath121 more generally , we shall `` modularise '' our spatio - temporal description , meaning that individual transition operators will change at various times in their own ways .",
    "typically , we shall leave out specific reference to the @xmath122 operators , writing for example @xmath123 to describe a particular change in the operator @xmath124 at a particular place and time during a given run .",
    "two important points need to be noted .",
    "first , our quantum register description is not designed to give us the dynamical details of such transitions .",
    "for that we need to invoke standard quantum mechanics . the quantum register description is designed to show more consistently how sequences of such dynamical changes get distributed around in time and space , making overall calculations of complex processes easier to calculate .",
    "second , because real physics experiments are irreversible , we need to be cautious about what operators such as @xmath117 really mean . they will have the semi - group property @xmath125 and satisfy @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the register identity operator , but we may have no clear physical interpretation of what the operator @xmath128 means , for @xmath129 .",
    "the two polarization degrees of freedom of photons make them analogous to electrons in certain situations .",
    "for instance , the passage of an monochromatic electromagnetic wave through a wollaston prism splits the wave into two spatially distinct waves , identified with two distinct mutually orthogonal transverse polarization components , shown in figure 3 .",
    "= 2.0 in    if @xmath130 is a monochromatic photon state , we may write @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 represent the two mutually orthogonal transverse polarization vectors involved .    the quantum register description of a wollaston prism , shown in figure 4 , turns out to be identical to that for the stern - gerlach experiment . in operator terms",
    ", we find @xmath134 which is formally identical to ( [ ccc ] ) .",
    "the stern - gerlach and wollaston prism experiments are the most elementary and useful examples of the sort of quantum experiments discussed by von neumann @xcite , where an ensemble of identically prepared initial states is passed through some test apparatus @xmath34 and a range of possible outcomes detected .",
    "the description of an idealized version of such an experiment leads to the so - called _ projection valued measure _ ( pvm ) description of quantum experiments .",
    "this is known to have its limitations , but remains an important concept .",
    "the general pvm test is shown in figure @xmath135 .",
    "for each run of an ensemble of runs , the initial state @xmath136 , which will be assumed to be pure , is prepared by some apparatus @xmath137 at time @xmath103 .",
    "subsequently , the prepared state is passed through test apparatus @xmath34 , and one out of @xmath138 possible outcomes detected at time @xmath139 . in von neumann",
    "s approach , @xmath90 is assumed to be a normalized element of some @xmath140dimensional hilbert space @xmath141 .",
    "the test @xmath34 is represented by some non - degenerate hermitian operator @xmath142 acting over @xmath141 .",
    "because of non - degeneracy , the @xmath143 @xmath144,@xmath145 can be normalized and form an orthonormal basis for @xmath141 , known as the _ preferred basis . _    = 2.5 in    because of completeness , we may write @xmath146 where @xmath147 the born probability interpretation then predicts the conditional outcome probabilities to be given by latexmath:[\\[p\\left ( a_{i}|\\psi _ { in}\\right ) = |\\langle a_{i}|\\psi _ { out}\\rangle     the quantum register description of a pvm scenario follows the pattern outlined for the stern - gerlach and wollaston prism experiments .",
    "we associate one qubit with every part of the apparatus wherever a state could be detected and new information acquired .",
    "this means one qubit for the preparation apparatus and one for each of the @xmath138 possible outcomes , shown in figure @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , we need a rank-@xmath150 quantum register for such a test .",
    "= 2.0 in    the quantum dynamics is given by the rule @xmath151 where the @xmath152 are given by the conventional quantum calculation ( [ ddd ] ) , so we find @xmath153 the conditional probabilities for the @xmath138 possible outcomes of the experiment are then given by the quantum register born rule @xmath154 states of the form @xmath155 and linear combinations of such states , will be called _ rank - one states .",
    "_ we define _ _  _ _ rank-@xmath156 states to be linear combinations of elements of the computational basis given by @xmath157 where the @xmath158 . for example",
    ", @xmath159 is a rank-@xmath81 state .",
    "eventually , it become apparent that the pvm formulation of quantum physics is too limited and it became superseded by the more general povm ( positive operator valued measure ) approach . in this new approach , quantum experiments can have more or less outcomes than the dimension of the hilbert space involved .",
    "for example , suppose we have an experiment with @xmath160 possible outcomes , with @xmath160 not necessarily equal to @xmath138 , the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath141 used to model the states of the system .",
    "for each outcome @xmath161 , @xmath162 , there is an associated positive operator @xmath163 , such that @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the identity operator over the hilbert space . given a normalized initial state @xmath166 , then the conditional probability @xmath167 of outcome @xmath161 is given by @xmath168 with condition ( [ bbb ] ) ensuring probabilities sum to unity .",
    "the above discussion involves pure states .",
    "in fact , the povm approach is more general than this and can be extended to cover mixed states , which requires a density matrix approach involving the taking of traces .",
    "we shall not be interested in this paper in such situations .",
    "the generalization of our quantum register description to cover such cases is not anticipated to be particularly difficult and is left for future consideration .",
    "we shall discuss now some situations where the povm approach would normally be invoked and give an alternative quantum register description .",
    "we recall that an arbitrary povm with a finite number of elements can always be converted into a von neumann ( maximal ) test by the introduction of an auxiliary , independently prepared quantum system known as an ancilla , a result which utilizes neumark s theorem @xcite .",
    "essentially , the original hilbert space @xmath141 is extended into one of higher dimension , @xmath169 , and von neumann s pvm formulation can be applied to @xmath169 directly .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it masks the spatio - temporal structure of the measurements involved and suggests that the simple @xmath170 structure of a single von neumann test is all that is going on . in reality , complex experiments involve sequences of processes rather like what happens in a computer , which is why quantum computation is one possible way to approach physics @xcite .",
    "suppose for example that instead of irreversibly registering all information about the outcomes of a von neumann test , we feed one or more of its possible outcome channels into some new test . quantum interference experiments , such as double - slit and mach - zender interferometer experiments , are of this form .",
    "as an example , consider the double stern - gerlach experiment shown in figure @xmath171 an electron is prepared by apparatus @xmath172 as in the original stern - gerlach experiment and passed through a stern - gerlach apparatus @xmath173 which has quantization axis  along vector @xmath174 any spin down outcome @xmath175 is recorded , whereas any spin up outcome @xmath176  is not registered but channelled into a second stern - gerlach apparatus @xmath177 which has quantization axis @xmath178 , with each of its possible outcomes being detectable .",
    "= 4.0 in    for any single run of the combined experiment , there are now three possible mutually exclusive outcomes , viz . , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , not two .",
    "for such an experiment , a pvm description involving a hilbert space of dimension two is not adequate .",
    "conventionally , either a povm description with three positive operators over a two - dimensional hilbert space is needed , or an ancilla has to be introduced if a pvm approach is desired , but this then requires an extension of the original hilbert space .",
    "the alternative we propose is a quantum register description , which describes such experiments quite readily . for the particular experiment shown in figure @xmath181",
    ", we require a rank-@xmath135 quantum register , as shown in figure @xmath182 .    in this experiment , the outcome channel @xmath183 of test @xmath184 serves as an _ ideal measurement _ @xcite or preparation for @xmath185 ; it is not absorbed by the detector but is used as an initial state for the subsequent test @xmath185 .",
    "this seems to be the only physically meaningful interpretation of the concept of `` state reduction '' .",
    "state reduction without subsequent testing is physically meaningless .",
    "therefore , rather than represent a final stage in a quantum process , state reduction should always be considered as a beginning .",
    "in optics , a beam splitter acts as a semi - transparent mirror , whereby part of an incident electromagnetic wave is reflected and part transmitted , as shown in figure @xmath186 :    in quantum optics , such a device is usually regarded as having _ two _ input ports and two output ports , as in figure @xmath187 , and is used in experiments involving quantum interference , such as the mach - zender experiment , discussed below .",
    "we recover the single input channel picture when one of the two input channels acts as a _ vacuum _ or void port .",
    "more generally , for a lossless beam splitter , the input and output waves are consistent with unitary evolution , and can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath188 = e^{i\\eta } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } a & b \\\\ -b^{\\ast } & a^{\\ast } \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\psi _ { 1 }",
    "\\\\ \\psi _ { 2 } \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath189 and @xmath190 is real .",
    "then @xmath191    = 4.0 in    a quantum register description of a beam splitter requires four qubits , as in figure @xmath192    = 2.0 in    the correct temporal evolution is given by @xmath193    this analysis applies to rank-1 states as well as rank-2 states .",
