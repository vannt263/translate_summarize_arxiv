    "the intriguing magnetotransport properties of manganite s family @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) with a @xmath22 mixed valence keep attracting much attention of both experimentalists and theorists .",
    "@xcite in the doping range @xmath23 , these compounds are known to undergo a double phase transition from paramagnetic ( pm ) insulator ( i ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal ( m ) state characterized by the curie temperature @xmath6 and the charge carrier localization temperature @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the so - called giant magnetoresistivity ( gmr ) exhibits a sharp peak around @xmath7 , while below @xmath6 the system acquires a spontaneous magnetization accompanied by a giant magnetic entropy changes .",
    "@xcite despite a variety of theoretical scenarios attempting to describe this phenomenon , practically all of them adopt as a starting point the so - called double - exchange ( de ) mechanism , which considers the exchange of electrons between neighboring @xmath22 sites with strong on - site hund s coupling .",
    "the estimated exchange energy  @xcite @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is an effective spin on a @xmath26 site ) , being much less than the fermi energy @xmath27 in these materials ( typically , @xmath28 ) , favors an fm ground state . in turn",
    ", an applied magnetic field @xmath29 enhances the fm order thus reducing the spin scattering and producing the observed negative gmr .",
    "the localization scenario ,  @xcite in which @xmath26 oxides are modelled as systems with both de off - diagonal spin disorder and nonmagnetic diagonal disorder , predicts a divergence of the electronic localization length @xmath30 at some m - i phase transition . in terms of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath31 , it means that for @xmath32 the system is in a highly resistive ( insulator - like ) phase , while for @xmath33 the system is in a low resistive ( metallic - like ) state . within this scenario ,",
    "the curie point @xmath6 is defined through the spontaneous magnetization @xmath31 as @xmath34 , while the m - i transition temperature @xmath7 is such that @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 being a fraction of the saturated magnetization @xmath37 ) .",
    "furthermore , the influence of magnetic fluctuations on electron - spin scattering near @xmath7 is expected to be rather important , for they can easily tip a subtle balance between magnetic and electronic processes in favor of either charge localization or delocalization . besides",
    ", the observable difference between the two critical temperatures ( usually attributed to the quality of a particular sample used  @xcite ) is ascribed to the random nonmagnetic scattering which is highly responsible for the magnitude of the observable gmr .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , in view of its carrier charge ( and density ) sensitive nature , thermopower ( tep ) measurements could complement the traditional mr data and be used as a tool for probing the field - induced delocalization of the carriers .",
    "indeed , studying the observable magneto - tep @xmath38 has already proved to be useful for providing important insights into different aspects of high-@xmath39 superconductors in the mixed state .",
    "@xcite besides , magneto - tep can be directly linked to the transport entropy change in applied magnetic field .",
    "the recently observed  @xcite giant magnetic entropy change in manganites ( produced by the abrupt reduction of the magnetization and attributed to an anomalous thermal expansion just at the curie point ) gives another reason to utilize the magneto - tep data in order to get an additional information as for the underlying transport mechanisms in these materials .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss some typical results for magneto - tep measurements on a manganite sample @xmath1 at @xmath40 field for a wide temperature interval ( ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ) . by approximating the true shape of the measured magneto - tep in the vicinity of the peak temperature @xmath3 by a linear triangle of the form @xmath43",
    ", we observe that @xmath5 . in an attempt to account for the observed behavior of the magneto - tep",
    ", we adopt the main ideas of the microscopic localization theory  @xcite and construct a phenomenological free energy functional of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type which describes the magnetic field and temperature behavior of the spontaneous magnetization in the presence of strong localization effects near @xmath3 . calculating the background and fluctuation contributions to the total magnetization and the transport entropy - induced magneto - tep @xmath0 within the gl theory , we obtain a simple relationship between @xmath3 and the above two critical temperatures ( @xmath10 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "we find also that the observed ratio @xmath11 asymmetry is governed by a universal parameter @xmath44 where @xmath12 is the electron - spin exchange and @xmath13 is the localization related magnetic energy . by comparing our data with the model predictions ,",
    "we deduce estimates for some important model parameters such as the curie point @xmath10 , the localization length @xmath45 , the critical magnetization @xmath46 , the exchange energy @xmath47 , and the free - to - localized carrier number density ratio @xmath48 , all in good agreement with the existing microscopic localization theories .",
    "@xmath1 samples were prepared from stoichiometric amounts of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 powders .",
    "the mixture was heated in the air at @xmath53 for 12 hours to achieve the decarbonation .",
    "then it was pressed at room temperature under @xmath54 to obtain parallelipedic pellets .",
    "an annealing and sintering from @xmath55 to @xmath53 was made slowly ( during 2 days ) to preserve the right phase stoichiometry . a small bar ( length @xmath56 ,",
    "cross section @xmath57 ) was cut from one pellet .",
    "the electrical resistivity @xmath58 was measured using the conventional four - probe method . to avoid joule and peltier effects ,",
    "a dc current @xmath59 was injected ( as a one second pulse ) successively on both sides of the sample .",
    "the voltage drop @xmath60 across the sample was measured with high accuracy by a @xmath61 nanovoltmeter .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath29 of @xmath62 was applied normally to the current .",
    "fig.1 presents the temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance ( mr ) @xmath63 for a @xmath1 sample at @xmath40 field .",
    "as is seen , the negative mr @xmath64 shows a peak ( dip ) at some temperature @xmath65 ( referred to as @xmath7 , in what follows ) where the gmr @xmath66 reaches @xmath67 .",
    "the thermopower ( tep ) @xmath68 was measured using the differential method .",
    "@xcite in order to generate a heat flow , a small heater film ( @xmath69 ) was attached to one end of the sample .",
    "two calibrated chromel - constantan thermocouples were used to measure the temperature difference between two points on the sample .",
    "the tep @xmath70 is deduced from the following equation , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the tep of the gold wires used to measure the voltage drop @xmath73 at the hot junctions of both thermocouples .",

    "now , with all this information in mind , let us proceed to the interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "since we are dealing with the magnetic - field induced changes of the tep , it is reasonable to assume that the observed behavior can be attributed to the corresponding changes of transport magnetic entropy ( and thus spontaneous magnetization ) in the presence of strong electron - spin exchange and localization effects , near some critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "later on , we will establish a simple ( linear ) relationship between the peak temperature @xmath3 and the two critical temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 , responsible respectively for pm - fm and m - i phase transitions .",
    "based on the above considerations , we can write @xmath83 for the balance of magnetic @xmath84 and electronic @xmath85 free energies participating in the transport processes under discussion . the observed magnetization @xmath31 and the magneto - tep behavior should result from the minimization of @xmath86 ( as , for example , is the case in superconductors where @xmath86 measures the difference between the normal and condensate energies  @xcite ) . in our case , the above electronic contribution reads @xmath87 and describes a coupling of spontaneous magnetization @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the order parameter and @xmath37 the saturated magnetization ) with ( i ) an effective de energy @xmath90 ( where @xmath68 is an effective spin on a @xmath26 site , and @xmath47 the exchange coupling constant ) , and ( ii ) the electronic ( localization ) energy @xmath91 ( where @xmath8 is the localization length , and @xmath92 an effective electron mass ) ; @xmath93 and @xmath94 stand for the number density of localized spins and conduction electrons , respectively . at the same time",

    "after trivial rearrangements , the above functional @xmath86 can be cast into a familiar gl type form describing the second - order phase transition from pm ( insulator ) to fm ( metal ) state near @xmath3 , namely @xmath100=a\\eta ^2 + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\eta ^4-\\zeta \\eta ^2.\\ ] ] here @xmath101 is the effective field - dependent chemical potential of quasiparticles ; @xmath102 with @xmath103 ; @xmath104 , and we used the conventional expression @xmath105 for the correlation length . besides , to account for the field - induced localization effects , we assume after sheng et al .",
    "@xcite that @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "given our previous experience with high-@xmath39 superconductors , we can readily present the observed magneto - tep in a two - term contribution form  @xcite @xmath109 where the average term @xmath108 is non - zero only below @xmath3 while the fluctuation term @xmath110 should contribute to the observable @xmath0 both above and below @xmath3 . in",
    "what follows , we shall discuss these two contributions separately within a mean - field theory approximation for gmr materials .    as usual , the equilibrium state of such a system",
    "is determined from the minimum energy condition @xmath111 which yields for @xmath80 @xmath112 substituting @xmath113 into eq.(2 ) we obtain for the average free energy density @xmath114=- \\frac{[\\alpha ( h)(t^{*}-t)+\\zeta ( h)]^2}{2\\beta } \\ ] ] in turn , the magneto - tep @xmath0 can be related to the corresponding difference of transport entropies  @xcite @xmath115 as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath94 are the charge and the number density of free carriers .",
    "finally the mean value of the magneto - tep reads ( below @xmath3 ) @xmath118 with @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "[ [ mean - field - gaussian - fluctuations - of - the - magneto - tep - delta - s_flth ] ] mean - field gaussian fluctuations of the magneto - tep : @xmath110 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the influence of fluctuations ( both gaussian and critical ) on transport properties of high-@xmath39 superconductors ( including tep , electrical and thermal conductivity ) was extensively studied and is very well documented ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and further references therein ) . in particular , it was found that the fluctuation - induced behavior may extend to temperatures more than @xmath124 higher than the critical temperature @xmath39 . as for manganites ,",
    "the fluctuation effects in these materials appear to be much less explored .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , according to the interpretation of the observed magneto - tep we adopt in the present paper , influence of magnetic fluctuations on electron - spin scattering near @xmath3 should be rather important .",
    "so , it seems appropriate to take a closer look at the region near @xmath3 to discuss the fluctuations of the magneto - tep @xmath110 . recall that according to the textbook theory of gaussian fluctuations ,  @xcite the fluctuations of any observable ( such as heat capacity , magnetization , etc ) which is conjugated to the order parameter @xmath125 can be presented in terms of the statistical average of the fluctuation amplitude @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",

    "$ ] @xmath100\\approx { \\cal f } [ \\eta _ 0]+ \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\frac{\\partial ^2{\\cal f } } { \\partial \\eta ^2}\\right ] _",
    "{ \\eta = \\eta _ 0}\\!(\\delta \\eta ) ^2,\\ ] ] around the mean value of the order parameter @xmath113 , which is defined as a stable solution of equation @xmath111 we can explicitly calculate the gaussian integrals .",
    "due to the fact that @xmath113 is given by eq.(4 ) below @xmath3 and vanishes at @xmath135 , we obtain finally @xmath136 and @xmath137 as we shall see below , for the experimental range of parameters under discussion , @xmath138 .",
    "hence , with a good accuracy we can linearize eqs.(11 ) and ( 12 ) and obtain for the fluctuation contribution to the magneto - tep @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 furthermore , it is quite reasonable to assume that @xmath142 , where the magneto - tep peak ( dip ) values are defined as follows , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the above equations allow us to fix the arbitrary parameter @xmath133 yielding @xmath145 .",
    "this in turn leads to the following expressions for the fluctuation contribution to peaks and slopes through their average counterparts ( see eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) ) : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "finally , the total contribution to the observable magneto - tep reads ( cf .",
    "eq.(1 ) ) @xmath150 where @xmath151 @xmath152 and @xmath153 b^{+}(h).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "notice that within our model the asymmetry of slopes ratio @xmath156 originates from the balance of the exchange @xmath157 and localization induced magnetic @xmath13 energies .      before turning to the comparison of our theoretical findings with the experimental data ,",
    "let us discuss the critical temperatures which control the magnetic ( @xmath6 ) and carrier localization `` metal - insulator '' ( @xmath7 ) phase transitions .",
    "according to the adopted model , these two temperatures are defined through the spontaneous magnetization @xmath158 as follows : @xmath159 and @xmath160 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the critical magnetization at which the zero - temperature localization length @xmath161 marking the m - i phase transition . according to section iii",
    ", the average magnetization reads @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the saturated magnetization , and the equilibrium order parameter @xmath164 is defined by eq.(4 ) .",
    "now , for the self - consistency of our approach , we need to find the fluctuation contributions to the magnetization as well . following the lines of the previous section , we obtain @xmath165 and @xmath166 as usual , to fix the constant @xmath167",
    ", we assume that @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the magnetization above @xmath3 . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath170 which leads to the following expression for the total magnetization below @xmath3 @xmath171 with @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath113 defined earlier .",
    "given the above definitions , the two critical temperatures are related to each other and to the magneto - tep peak temperature @xmath3 within our model as follows @xmath174 with @xmath175 let us compare now the obtained theoretical expressions with our experimental data on @xmath1 ( see fig.2 ) . by comparing the ratios @xmath176 and @xmath177 , we obtain @xmath178 for the slopes asymmetry parameter leading to @xmath179 .",
    "then , using eq.(18 ) , @xmath180 , @xmath2 , and just obtained @xmath181 , we get @xmath182 which in turn brings about @xmath183 for the curie temperature ( this value falls into the reported range of the fm transition temperatures for this class of manganites  @xcite ) . using this temperature and assuming @xmath25 for an effective mn spin , we can estimate the value of the exchange energy @xmath47 ( via the mean - field expression for the critical field @xmath184 ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath15 , which agrees with other reported estimates of this parameter .",
    "@xcite besides , from eq.(23 ) we immediately get a simple relationship between the two critical temperatures , @xmath185 which allows us to estimate the critical magnetization @xmath36 ( related to the localization magnetic field @xmath186 ) . using @xmath187 ( deduced from the gmr data on the same sample as a peak temperature , see fig.1 ) , we obtain @xmath16 , in a good agreement with the localization theory prediction .",
    "@xcite next , with the above estimates in mind , eq.(17 ) yields @xmath17 for the localization length  @xcite ( using a free electron mass @xmath188 for @xmath92 ) . finally , observing that @xmath189 we obtain @xmath18 for an estimate of the free - to - localized carrier number density ratio which leads to the saturated magnetization @xmath190 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the found localization energy @xmath191 is of the order of the fermi energy @xmath27 , as expected for manganites .",
    "@xcite to conclude with the estimates , we note that @xmath192 which _ a posteriori _ justifies the use of the linearized eq.(13 ) for the fluctuation region @xmath193 .",
    "as is seen in fig.2 , this criterion is well met in our case .    in summary , to account for the observed temperature dependence of the magneto - tep @xmath0 in @xmath1 , exhibiting a field - dependent peak at some temperature @xmath3 ( lying in - between the charge carrier localization temperature @xmath7 where the observed negative magnetoresistivity has a minimum , and magnetic transition temperature @xmath6 which marks the occurence of the spontaneous magnetization ) , we adopted the ideas of the localization model and introduced a free energy functional of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type describing the phase transition from paramagnetic ( insulator ) to ferromagnetic ( metal ) state near @xmath3 . calculating both average and fluctuation contributions to the total magnetization and magneto - tep within the gl theory , we were able to successfully fit the data and estimate some important model parameters ( including the metal - insulator @xmath7 and magnetic @xmath6 transition temperatures , localization length @xmath45 , electron - spin exchange coupling constant @xmath47 , and the free - to - localized carrier number density ratio @xmath48 ) , all in a reasonable agreement with existing microscopic theories .",
    "the gaussian fluctuations both above and below @xmath3 are found to substantially contribute to the peak value @xmath194 of the observed magneto - tep , amounting to @xmath195 and @xmath196 , respectively .",
