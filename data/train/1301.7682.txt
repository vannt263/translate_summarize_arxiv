    "while cooperative behavior is ubiquitous in nature , it is puzzling to understand from an evolutionary perspective : _ free - riders _ benefit from cooperation but save the costs to provide a public good and hence have a fitness advantage compared to",
    "_ cooperators _  @xcite . to overcome this _ dilemma of cooperation _ , additional mechanisms must be effective which select for cooperators .",
    "one important mechanism is the spatial clustering of cooperators where cooperators preferentially interact with other cooperators  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated by the _",
    "spatial prisoner s dilemma _",
    "@xcite where , in contrast to its famous well - mixed variant  @xcite , individuals are arranged on a lattice and only interact with their nearest neighbors .",
    "hence fitness explicitly depends on the composition of the neighborhood .",
    "many different studies , employing a variety of deterministic and stochastic interaction rules , have confirmed that the formation of cooperative clusters can promote cooperation in such setups , see e.g. refs .",
    "this was also found for complex spatial structures like networks @xcite .",
    "spatial clustering has also been studied experimentally .",
    "for example , le gac et al .",
    "@xcite have found in experiments with toxin - producing _",
    "e.  coli _ that cooperation can also be maintained through cluster formation in a viscous environment and the degree of diffusion of the public good can be crucial for the evolutionary outcome .",
    "theoretical studies also show that there can be a critical phase - transition into a purely cooperative state if costs fall below a certain threshold value  @xcite .",
    "importantly , however , in spatial setups mobility can strongly challenge the evolution of cooperation  @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with recent studies by chiong and kirley  @xcite , who found a statistically not significant enhancement of cooperation for small mobility , and a strong reduction for intermediate mobility . for the spatial prisoner s dilemma ,",
    "complex forms of mobility relying on more sophisticated abilities , like success driven mobility , have been shown to promote cooperation  @xcite .",
    "however , undirected mobility ( i.e.  diffusion ) , ubiquitous in biological situations , fosters the invasion of free - riders into cooperative clusters and thereby strongly counteracts the evolution of cooperation .",
    "thus if undirected mobility threatens cooperation and mobility is undeniably a part of biological reality , this raises the question how fundamental spatial clustering as a mechanism to explain cooperation really is .    in this manuscript",
    "we investigate the impact of diffusive mobility on the level of cooperation and analyze the critical mobility where cooperation breaks down . to study this question ,",
    "an understanding of the biological origin of fitness is crucial .",
    "while fitter individuals are selected for over many generations , fitness itself is the result of a multitude of different more microscopic processes like nutrient uptake or metabolic processes , which occur on much shorter time scales than reproduction .",
    "for example , when iron is lacking in the environment , cooperative strains of the proteobacteria _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _",
    "produce iron - scavenging molecules ( siderophores )  @xcite . released into the environment these molecules can efficiently bind single iron atoms and form complexes that can then be taken up by surrounding bacteria .",
    "associated with the metabolic costs and benefits , the fitness of an individual changes with every siderophore production and iron - uptake process .",
    "however , reproduction and selection of fitter individuals only occurs after many such processes , on a longer time scale .",
    "this biologically more realistic origin of fitness has been mostly neglected in previous models by regarding fitness collection and reproduction as simultaneous events . in a population where building up fitness is a life - long dynamic process ( _ fitness collection _ ) , the individuals mobility plays a particularly crucial role as the individuals fitness strongly depends on the neighborhoods which they inhabit during their life span .",
    "we here study a spatial prisoner s dilemma game and explicitly take fitness collection dynamics into account . with this formulation",
    "we are able to reproduce the expected limits . for vanishing mobility",
    ", we observe clustering and the typical spatial prisoner s dilemma dynamics . in contrast , for high mobility , we recover the dynamics of the replicator equation for the well - mixed prisoner s dilemma .",
    "the transition between these scenarios is not smooth but separated by a critical non - equilibrium phase transition : below critical costs and mobility values only cooperators remain in the long run while above only free - riders persist .",
    "consider @xmath0 individuals occupying the sites of a regular @xmath1-dimensional square lattice with a linear extension @xmath2 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each individual is either a cooperator ( @xmath3 ) or free - rider ( @xmath4 ) and individuals only interact with their nearest neighbors .. nearest neighbors in @xmath5 and with @xmath6 nearest neighbors in @xmath7 . ] in contrast to common dynamical formulations of the spatial prisoner s dilemma  @xcite , we drop the assumption of a coupled payoff - collection and selection step and thereby take into account that both processes in general occur on vastly different time - scales . taken together ,",
    "our model considers three different reaction steps which can occur at distinct rates .",
    "we chose our time unit @xmath8 as the average lifetime of an individual when the selection is neutral ( i.e.  when the fitness of all individuals is @xmath9 ) , see below .",
    "corresponds to the average lifetime if an individual is completely surrounded by neighbors with the opposing strategy and if the selection is neutral ] the rates are then defined as the average number of steps occurring per unit time @xmath10 .",
    "_ payoff collection _ occurs at a per capita rate @xmath11 .",
    "an individual engages in a pairwise interaction with one of its randomly chosen nearest neighbors . when the chosen neighbors are distinct , the cooperator @xmath3 collects a payoff @xmath12 due to the costs of cooperation while the free - rider @xmath4 receives the benefit @xmath13 . when the neighbors are both cooperators or both free - riders they receive a payoff @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the payoff collection process of each individual continues during the whole course of its life , and the _ collected fitness _",
    "@xmath16 of an individual @xmath17 at a certain time is given by the collected payoff the individual has received up to that time , @xmath18 here , @xmath19 denotes the number of interactions individual @xmath17 encountered .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the payoff for individual @xmath17 received during the @xmath21-th interaction with another individual .",
    "in addition , a background fitness of @xmath9 describes impacts on the fitness which are the same for each individual .",
    "we also implemented an alternative model , in which only the last @xmath22 interaction steps contribute to the fitness .",
    "this is a possible implementation for a biological situation in which interactions from the distant past do not contribute to the present fitness ; @xmath22 can be seen as a memory range . a short memory range can significantly change the outcome , but if @xmath23 , the results are equivalent to the model without memory limitation .",
    "the impact of this alternative model of fitness collection will be further discussed below .    for the rest of the paper , we take a fixed collection rate @xmath24 , i.e. the collection rate is chosen significantly larger than the reproduction timescale .",
    "actually , for many biological situations , @xmath25 is expected @xcite . however , our qualitative findings are robust under the choice of @xmath11 .",
    "_ reproduction and selection _ is given by the replacement of one individual @xmath17 by a new individual belonging to the other type .",
    "importantly , the rate for such a replacement event to occur depends on the type of the individual @xmath17 , and the fitness of its nearest neighbors . for specificity",
    ", we take the corresponding transition rate for an individual @xmath17 at a site @xmath26 as the fitness of its neighbors @xmath27 with the opposite strategy times the probability @xmath28 of an interaction with them :    [ transitionrates ] @xmath29    here , @xmath30 individual @xmath21 is a free - rider and @xmath31 if individual @xmath21 is a cooperator .",
    "if the neighbor at site @xmath32 belongs to the same type as the individual at site @xmath26 , this neighbor does not contribute to the replacement rate @xmath33 .",
    "conversely , if it belongs to the other type , it increases the replacement rate of @xmath17 by its fitness @xmath34 . if a selection event has taken place , we assume that the new individual starts with zero fitness .. however , the model was robust under this change ]    _ mobility _ is taken to be independent of fitness collection and selection dynamics .",
    "an individual interchanges its position with one of its randomly chosen nearest neighbors with a per capita hopping rate @xmath35 . if @xmath36 is the lattice spacing , this corresponds to a macroscopic diffusion constant of @xmath37 in one dimension , and @xmath38 in two dimensions . while payoff - collection and mobility events per individual occur with constant rates @xmath11 and @xmath35 , respectively , the rate for a selection event , @xmath39 , depends both on the life history of the interacting individuals and the composition of the local neighborhood .",
    "the time evolution of the system is determined by a markov process ensuing from the rates for the various processes introduced above . to investigate the dynamics we performed extensive stochastic simulations of the underlying time - continuous stochastic process employing the gillespie algorithm  @xcite .",

    ", there are no transitions between different types within clusters but only at the domain boundaries between cooperator and free - rider clusters . there ,",
    "the dynamics is determined by two antagonistic effects . on the one hand , cooperators at the boundary benefit from the neighboring cooperators within their cluster , and from their previous interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "a free - riding individual still has a fitness advantage by saving the costs for providing cooperation . from our numerical simulations we observe that for a benefit @xmath52 , the costs of cooperation have to be lower than a critical value , @xmath53 in one dimension and @xmath54 in two dimensions , for cooperators to persist , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ]  ( a ) and ( b ) . throughout the rest of this manuscript",
    "we take the benefit @xmath55 as fixed .",
    "other values for @xmath56 do not lead to qualitative changes of the model .    for the alternative implementation of the payoff collection , where only the last @xmath22 payoff collection steps contribute to the fitness , the qualitative dynamics remained unchanged as long as @xmath22 was greater than @xmath9 .",
    "but importantly , cooperators always died out in one dimension if only the last payoff collection step was remembered ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "therefore , in a one - dimensional system the memory of past interactions is an essential mechanism for the support of cooperation , and spatial structure alone can not promote cooperation : in one dimension , both a cooperator and a free - rider at a domain wall always interact with exactly one cooperator and one free - rider .",
    "if just the payoff from such a configuration is remembered , the free - rider at the domain wall will on the average always be fitter than the cooperator ( if the cooperation costs @xmath46 are greater than zero ) .",
    "however , if past interactions are remembered , a cooperator that has been inside of its cluster for a long time has acquired a high average payoff from these past interactions .",
    "such a cooperator will not suffer too much from few interactions with a free - rider when it comes to a domain wall . in turn , a free - rider that has been within its cluster very long has also a very low fitness .",
    "memory effects can therefore strengthen cooperation and are crucial for the cooperator survival in one dimension . in two dimensions ,",
    "on the other hand , spatial structure alone can maintain cooperation , even without memory effects ( i.e.  even if @xmath57 ) .",
    "a cooperator at a domain wall can get a benefit from up to three cooperating neighbors from its cluster if the domain wall is linear .",
    "an advantageous domain wall can make mutual cooperation beneficial and protect cooperators if the costs @xmath46 are not too high .",
    "however , cooperation is unstable under the influence of mobility , both in one and in two dimensions .",
    "the interchange in position of neighboring individuals disturbs the formation of sharply separated clusters . with increasing mobility @xmath35 ,",
    "cluster boundaries become more and more blurred . as a consequence ,",
    "cooperators are surrounded by fewer and fewer peers and thereby lose their advantage of interacting in a highly cooperative neighborhood .",
    "cooperativity therefore strongly decays when @xmath35 is increased .",
    "remarkably , we find that there is a critical phase transition separating phases where only cooperators or only free - riders are expected to persist in the long run . while for sufficiently high mobility and costs only free - riders remain , cooperation is the only surviving strategy when mobility and costs fall below critical values .",
    "thus in either case the stationary state of the dynamics is an absorbing state .",
    "the phase diagrams for the one- and for the two - dimensional model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "other than in previous prisoner s dilemma models  @xcite , no fluctuating active phase with coexistence of cooperators and free - riders was observed .",

    "the population dynamics is mainly governed by processes occurring at the boundaries between domains dominated by cooperators and free - riders , respectively . in this section ,",
    "we give a simplified analysis for the dynamics of theses domain walls and thereby approximately calculate the critical costs @xmath60 below which cooperators can survive .",
    "the schematics of the simplified domain wall picture is shown in fig .  [",

    "the one - dimensional case we consider an isolated domain wall , and reduce the dynamics to the two boundary sites between a cooperator and a free - rider domain , and consider the remainder of both domains to be static .",
    "the possible configurations of the domain wall boundary are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : frontier ]  @xmath61@xmath62 . among others",
    ", this scheme neglects events where domain walls are created or annihilated .",
    "similarly , for the two - dimensional lattice , we constrain the dynamics to the immediate vicinity of the domain wall and consider a @xmath63 section at the domain wall boundary whose possible configurations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : frontier ]  @xmath64@xmath65 .",
    "the remainder of the domain wall is considered as a static horizontal front .",
    "again , these assumptions leave out many other possible processes changing the domain wall boundaries .",
    "nevertheless , such a strongly simplified model seems to retain the most essential features of the domain wall dynamics , since the estimates for the critical costs @xmath60 are in good agreement with the simulation results ( see below ) .",
    "we start our analysis with the one - dimensional model .",
    "the dynamics of the domain wall is then governed by transitions between the four states @xmath61 , ... , @xmath62 , which occur at rates determined by eqs .",

    "we resort to a mean - field picture and aim to derive a rate equation , @xmath66 , which determines the time evolution of the probabilities @xmath67 to find one of these four configurations .",
    "let us first assume that each individual collects the payoff from all of its neighbors , such that the fitness of each individual can be approximated by the mean payoff received from its neighborhood .",
    "the transition rates between different configurations can then be calculated from eq .  .",
    "for example , the transition from @xmath68 to @xmath69 occurs if the free - rider in configuration @xmath68 turns into a cooperator . according to eq .  , the rate for this to happen is the fitness of the cooperating left and right neighbors , @xmath70 , times the probability @xmath71 that a particular neighbor is chosen : @xmath72 under the assumption , that these neighbors have previously collected equal amounts of fitness from both of its neighbors ( @xmath9 is the neutral fitness , @xmath73 is the payoff from a cooperating neighbor , @xmath12 is the payoff from a free - riding neighbor ) , the fitness for the right and left neighbor can be calculated . since the left neighbor is surrounded by a cooperator and a free - rider",

    "analogous calculations for the remaining transitions rates lead to the following transition matrix @xmath76 : @xmath77 the stationary probability vector is given by @xmath78 .",
    "whether the domain wall mainly moves forward or backward is determined by the difference between the stationary values of the all - cooperator state @xmath69 and the all - free - rider state @xmath62 .",
    "the sign determines whether cooperators or free - riders finally take over the whole population . calculating the null - vector @xmath79 we find that @xmath80 which is strictly negative unless @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , if we can assume that the fitness of each individual is given by the mean payoff , the critical costs for cooperation is @xmath82 .",
    "this result reemphasizes that spatial structure alone can not promote cooperation in one dimension .",
    "however , as we know from our numerical analysis in the previous section , memory effects  not taken into account so far  can actually promote cooperation .    within the framework of the simple model depicted in fig .  [ fig : frontier ] infinite memory",
    "can be incorporated by assigning to the individuals in the static clusters a fixed fitness of @xmath83 and @xmath9 for cooperators and free - riders , respectively .",
    "the underlying assumption is that these static players have been inside of their respective cluster for a long time and have not interacted much with the opposing strategy .",
    "for example , consider a static cooperator that has been inside of its cluster during the last @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) interaction steps , and finally ends up at the domain wall , where it interacts with a free - rider once .",
    "the fitness of such a cooperator would then according to eq .",
    "be given by @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "if the number of previous interactions within a cluster is assumed to be very large for individuals in static clusters , their fitness can therefore be approximated @xmath87 and @xmath9 for cooperators and free - riders , respectively . with this assumption for static players , the transition rate from @xmath68 to @xmath69 now reads @xmath88 .",
    "this is similar to the above calculation but the static cooperator left of the free - rider in @xmath68 is now assumed to have a fitness of @xmath87 . with this modification ,",
    "the transition matrix becomes @xmath89 now we find that in the stationary state @xmath90 , which implies a critical cost of @xmath91 .",
    "this value is in good agreement both with the phase diagram fig .",
    "3(a ) and with the numerical value for the critical costs determined by finite - size scaling ( see table  1 ) .    in two dimensions , spatial structure alone can provide a mechanism for the survival of cooperation and therefore memory effects do not need to be taken into account .",
    "the calculation of the transition rates between the ten different configurations illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontier](b ) is analogous to the one - dimensional case . for example",
    ", a transition between @xmath64 and @xmath92 occurs if either one of the two cooperators in configuration @xmath64 turns into a free - rider . in each of these two cases",
    "there is a probability of @xmath93 that for the given cooperator a free - rider is chosen as an interaction partner .",
    "the fitness of which is @xmath94 since it has one cooperator but three free - riders as its neighbors . taken together , the transition rate reads @xmath95 .",
    "transitions between the various configurations @xmath96 may also occur due to hopping events .",
    "these were disregarded in our discussion of the one - dimensional case .",
    "here , we take those events into account in the limit of small mobility rates ; for large mobilities clusters become more and more blurred and the cluster approximation is not applicable . as an example , consider the transition from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , which is a purely diffusive transition .",
    "the transition rate is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the rate at which either the free - rider in @xmath97 or its lower cooperating neighbor are chosen for a mobility step , and @xmath93 is the probability that the other neighbor ( the free - rider , if the cooperator was previously chosen , and vice versa ) is picked for swapping places    = -0.2pt = 1mu @xmath101    the condition that no movement of the front occurs in the stationary state , i.e.  that @xmath102 , leads to an approximate numerical solution for the critical costs @xmath58 , which is shown as a green line in fig .",

    "fitness collection dynamics , the correct asymptotic limits for vanishing and large mobility , the spatial and the well - mixed variants of the prisoner s dilemma are obtained .",
    "while in two dimensions , spatial structure alone is sufficient to promote cooperation , the memory of past interactions is a necessary condition for cooperation in one dimension .",
    "in fact , memory effects can be seen as an additional mechanism favoring cooperation  and they are expected to occur even in simple organisms , since their fitness depends on several interactions with their environment .",
    "memory effects have already been found to promote cooperation in a deterministic game @xcite .",
    "the present study confirms this finding for a stochastic setup and shows that they are of essential importance in one dimension .    for a certain intermediate mobility ( depending on benefit and costs ) there is a critical phase transition without stable coexistence , both in one and in two dimensions .",
    "below critical mobilities and costs only cooperators remain while above only free - riders remain in the long run .",
    "this phase transition is robust against changes of dynamical details , like a limited payoff collection capability .",
    "more importantly , for cooperation to prevail in the spatial prisoner s dilemma , the time - scale of mobility must always be of the same order or lower as the selection time - scale .",
    "if one considers for example microbial populations , the spatial prisoner s dilemma can only explain cooperation if the reproduction time of the microbes under consideration is of the same order as the time they need to move to a neighboring bacterium .",
    "this condition is probably not fulfilled in most ecological situations .",
    "thus , at least in its standard formulation , the spatial prisoner s dilemma might serve as a placative example to explain how spatial clustering can promote cooperation in principle .",
    "but it can not serve as a substantive explanation for cooperative behavior in natural populations . in microbial populations , more complex clustering of microbes into different colonies ,",

    "<S> thus , in most biological scenarios , where the mobility of competing individuals is an irrefutable fact , the spatial prisoner s dilemma alone can not explain stable cooperation but additional mechanisms are necessary for spatial structure to promote the evolution of cooperation . </S>",
    "<S> the breakdown of cooperation is analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the existence of a phase transition , here controlled by mobility and costs , which distinguishes between purely cooperative and non - cooperative absorbing states . while in one dimension </S>",
    "<S> the model is in the class of the voter model , it belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class in two dimensions . </S>"
