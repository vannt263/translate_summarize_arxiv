    "when @xmath2 is a hyperplane arrangement complement in projective space @xmath8 , the notion of an _ admissible _ local system @xmath5 on @xmath2 is defined in terms of some conditions on the residues of an associated logarithmic connection @xmath9 on a good compactification of @xmath2 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this notion plays a key role in the theory , since for such an admissible local system @xmath10 on @xmath2 one has @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a line arrangement in the complex projective plane @xmath13 and denote its arrangement complement by @xmath2 .",
    "for the case of line arrangements , a good compactification is obtained by blowing - up points of multiplicity larger than @xmath14 in @xmath0 .",
    "this explains the simple definition of the admissibility given below in definition [ dl ] .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced a class of line arrangements for which all rank one local systems on the complements are admissible .",
    "namely , for each non - negative integer @xmath15 , the line arrangement @xmath0 is called to be of type @xmath16 if @xmath15 is the minimal number of lines in @xmath0 containing all the points of multiplicity at least @xmath4 .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that    [ thm - nr ] let @xmath0 be a line arrangement in @xmath1 . if @xmath0 belongs to the class @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , then any rank one local system @xmath5 on @xmath2 is admissible .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve the work in @xcite , see remark [ rm1 ] below .",

    "theorem [ thm - nr ] above shows that for such arrangements which are called of type @xmath26 all rank one local systems on the complement are admissible .    in @xcite",

    "in particular , the characteristic variety @xmath37 does not contain translated components and @xmath37 is determined by the poset @xmath38 .    in section 2",
    "we first make explicit the admissibility condition in the case of line arrangements and recall the definition of characteristic varieties .",
    "then we prove theorem [ mainthm ] . in the end of section 2",
    "we give example of a line arrangement where the results in @xcite and @xcite can not be applied while theorem [ mainthm ] is useful ( example [ ex1 ] ) .    in section 3",

    "accordingly , theorem [ mainthm ] does not hold if there are more than one cycle , also theorem [ thm3 ] is not true without the condition ( 1 ) .",
    "that means our results are best possible .    in the last section , we will study the _ multinets _ and _ resonance varieties_. we will prove that if the line arrangements @xmath0 satisfies the condition ( c ) then it does not support any multinets , equivalently , these is not any _ global resonance component _ except all lines in @xmath0 are concurrent .",
