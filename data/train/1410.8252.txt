    "in the recent decade , gravitational lensing has proven to be one of the major techniques of detecting and characterizing extrasolar planetary systems . due to the favorable geometry in the galaxy where microlensing phenomena occur",
    ", this technique is sensitive to planets orbiting their host stars with separations 0.510 au .",
    "the technique is sensitive to low - mass planets  down to earth - mass planets and even smaller masses if observed from space .",
    "it can also detect planets not bound to stars  free - floating planets @xcite .",
    "therefore , it provides an important tool that enables a census of extrasolar planets in the very important region of parameter space that is generally inaccessible to other techniques : the region beyond the snow line where cold giant planets are most probably forming .",
    "such a census will be complementary to the one provided by transit and radial - velocity surveys .",
    "first assessments of the planet frequency in the microlensing domain have already been published @xcite . however , these studies were based on a limited number of planetary microlensing events .",
    "precise analysis requires a much larger number of microlensing planets .",
    "new observational strategies of microlensing experiments have been implemented in the last several years , leading to significant increase of the number of planet detections .",
    "after the initial period of pioneering detections , the planetary microlensing field has undergone rapid changes and continues to evolve toward the next - generation experiments .",
    "the traditional first - generation approach was that some selected microlensing events detected by large - scale surveys like the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) and the microlensing observation in astrophysics ( moa ) projects were densely observed by follow - up groups such as @xmath5fun , planet , robonet and mindstep .",
    "since then , the experiments have adopted more sophisticated observing strategies .",
    "for example , the second - generation microlensing surveys consist of a network of wide - field telescopes capable of observing large areas of the galactic bulge field with high cadences of about 10  20 minutes . starting from the 2010 observing season when the fourth phase of the ogle survey began regular observations with the 1.3-m telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile , the second - generation microlensing network began to take shape .",
    "the ogle - iv observing setup together with the 1.8-m moa - ii telescope located at mount john observatory in new zealand and the 1-m telescope at the wise observatory in israel became the backbone of the second - generation network capable of conducting round - the - clock observations of selected fields in the galactic bulge .",
    "there has also been progress in follow - up observations , including the formation of new - generation follow - up networks with enhanced observing capability , e.g. , robonet ( a network of robotic telescopes from lcogt and the liverpool telescope ) .",
    "one of the most important discoveries made with the microlensing technique is the detection of cold giant planets orbiting faint m - type dwarf stars .",
    "these discoveries are the straight consequence of the fact that microlensing does not rely on the light from a host star in order to detect a planet .",
    "this implies that the dependency of the microlensing sensitivity to planets on the spectral type of host stars is weak and the sensitivity extends down to late m  dwarfs and beyond .",
    "studying planets around m  dwarfs is important because these stars comprise @xmath6  75% of stars in the solar neighborhood and the galaxy as a whole",
    ". planets around m  dwarfs have been probed by the radial - velocity and transit methods , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . however , the low luminosity of m  dwarfs poses serious difficulties in searching for planets with these methods .",
    "furthermore , the host stars of m - dwarf planets discovered so far tend to occupy the brighter end of the m  dwarf range . as a result ,",
    "the characteristics of the lower - mass m - dwarf planet population are essentially unknown . in addition",
    ", all m - dwarf planets detected by the radial - velocity method are located within only a few dozens of parsecs from the sun and thus the sample of these planets is greatly biased not only to the spectral type of host stars but also to the distance from the solar system .    by contrast , the most frequent host stars of microlensing planets are m dwarfs , including a planet with its host star directly imaged @xcite and several others whose masses are constrained by microlensing light curves and auxiliary data @xcite .",
    "in addition , lensing events occur regardless of the stellar types of lensing objects and thus one can obtain a sample of planetary systems unbiased by the stellar types of host stars . furthermore",
    ", lensing events occur by objects distributed in a wide range of the galaxy between the earth and the galactic center and thus one can obtain a planet sample more representative of the whole galaxy .",
    "constructing an unbiased sample of planets around m  dwarfs is important for understanding the formation mechanism of these planets .",
    "a theory based on the core accretion mechanism predicts that gas giants form much less frequently around m  dwarfs than around sun - like stars , while terrestrial and ice giant planets may be relatively common @xcite .",
    "an alternative theory based on the disk instability mechanism predicts that giant planets can form around m dwarfs @xcite  the opposite to the prediction of planet formation by the core accretion mechanism .",
    "therefore , determining the characteristics and the frequency of planets orbiting m  dwarfs is important in order to refine the planetary formation scenario of these planets .    in this paper , we report the discovery of another giant planet orbiting an m3-m4 dwarf that was detected from the light curve analysis of the microlensing event ogle-2011-blg-0265 .",
    "although modeling the microlensing light curve yields two solutions that can not be fully distinguished with the currently available data , both solutions indicate a jupiter - mass planet .",
    "there is good prospect on resolving the ambiguity of the solutions in the future when the lens and the source separate .",
    "the gravitational microlensing event ogle-2011-blg-0265 was discovered on 2011 april 16 by the ogle early warning system ( ews ) during the test phase of its implementation for the ogle - iv survey .",
    "it was officially announced on 2011 may 25 as one of 431 events in the inauguration set of events detected during the 2011 season .",
    "the event was also found by the moa group and designated as moa-2011-blg-197 .",
    "the microlensed source star of the event is located at @xmath7 in equatorial coordinates and @xmath8 in galactic coordinates ( with the accuracy of the absolute position of the order of 0.1 arcsec ) .",
    "this region of the sky corresponds to the densest stellar region in the galactic bulge toward which vast majority of microlensing events are being detected .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows the finding chart of the event taken in 2010 when the source had not yet been magnified .",
    "the brightness and color of the event at the baseline , calibrated to the standard @xmath9 system , are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the ogle - iv survey is conducted using the 1.3-m warsaw telescope equipped with the 32-ccd mosaic camera located at the las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "a single image covers approximately 1.4 square degrees with a resolution of 0.26 arcsec / pixel .",
    "ogle-2011-blg-0265 is located in the `` blg504 '' ogle - iv field which was observed with 18-minute cadence in the 2011 season .",
    "see the ogle web page for the map of the sky coverage .",
    "the exposure time was 100 seconds and the variability monitoring was performed in the @xmath12-band filter .",
    "several @xmath13-band images were also taken during the event in order to determine the color of the source star .",
    "the analyzed ogle - iv data set of the event contains 3749 epochs covering three observing seasons 2010  2012 .",
    "the moa project is regularly surveying the galactic bulge with the 1.8-m telescope at the mt .",
    "john observatory in new zealand .",
    "images are collected with a ten - ccd mosaic camera covering @xmath14 square degrees .",
    "ogle-2011-blg-0265 lies in the high - cadence moa field `` gb10 '' which is typically visited a few times per hour , enabling to take 4774 epochs in total during the 2006 - 2012 seasons .",
    "observations were conducted using the wide non - standard @xmath15/@xmath12 filter with the exposure time of 60 seconds .",
    "ogle-2011-blg-0265 is also located in the footprint of the survey conducted at the wise observatory in israel with the 1.0-m telescope and four - ccd mosaic camera , laiwo @xcite .",
    "this site fills the longitudinal gap between the ogle and moa sites enabling round - the - clock coverage of the event . in",
    "total 710 epochs were obtained from this survey .",
    "observations were carried out with the @xmath12-band filter and the exposure time was 180 seconds .    ogle-2011-blg-0265 event turned out to evolve relatively slowly .",
    "data collected by survey observations have good enough coverage of the anomaly and overall light curve to identify the planetary nature of the event .",
    "nevertheless , the phenomenon was also monitored by several follow - up groups based on the anomaly alert issued on july 2 , 2011 by the moa group .",
    "it should be noted that the ogle group generally does not issue alerts of ongoing anomalies in the present phase .",
    "the groups that participated in the follow - up observations include the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet : beaulieu et al .",
    "2006 ) , microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath5fun : gould et al .",
    "2006 ) , robonet @xcite , and mindstep @xcite .",
    "telescopes used for these observations include planet 1.0-m of south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in south africa , planet 0.6-m of perth observatory in australia , @xmath5fun 1.3-m smarts telescope of cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile , @xmath5fun 0.4-m of auckland observatory in new zealand , @xmath5fun 0.36-m of farm cove observatory ( fco ) in new zealand , @xmath5fun 0.8-m of observatorio del teide in tenerife , spain ,",

    "a consistent interpretation of these analyses was that the anomaly was produced by a planetary companion to the lens star .",
    "the models also predicted that there would be another perturbation in about ten days after the first anomaly followed by the event peak just after the second anomaly .",
    "based on this prediction , follow - up observations were continued beyond the main anomaly up to the peak and even beyond .",
    "this enabled dense coverage of the second anomaly which turned out to be important for the precise characterization of the lens system .",
    "see section [ sec : solution ] .",
    "the event did not return to its baseline until the end of the 2011 season  @xmath16 . in order to obtain baseline data ,",
    "observations were resumed in the 2012 season that started on @xmath17 . combined",
    "survey and follow - up photometry constitute a very continuous and complete data set with the very dense coverage of the planetary anomaly .",
    "data acquired from different observatories were reduced using photometry codes that were developed by the individual groups .",
    "the photometry codes used by the ogle and moa groups , developed respectively by @xcite and @xcite , are based on the difference image analysis method @xcite .",
    "the pysis pipeline @xcite was used for the reduction of the planet data and the wise data .",
    "the @xmath5fun data were processed using the dophot pipeline @xcite . for the robonet and mindstep data ,",
    "the dandia pipeline @xcite was used .    to analyze the data sets obtained from different observatories , we rescale the reported uncertainties for each data set ( cf .",
    "the microlensing magnification significantly changes the brightness of the measured object during the event and it is often the case that the reported uncertainties by the automatic pipelines are underestimated by different amounts . to account for this , we first adjust uncertainties by introducing a quadratic term so that the cumulative distribution function of @xmath18 as a function of magnification becomes linear .",
    "we then rescale error bars so that @xmath18 per degree of freedom ( dof ) becomes unity for each data set , where the value of @xmath18 is derived from the best - fit solution .",
    "this process greatly helps to estimate uncertainties of the lensing parameters .",
    "it is done in an iterative manner using the full model ( i.e. , with effects of parallax and orbital motion taken into account ) .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the light curve of ogle-2011-blg-0265 .",
    "the subset of gathered data that were used in the final calculations is presented . for the most part ,",
    "the light curve is well represented by a smooth and symmetric curve of a standard lensing event caused by a single - mass object @xcite except for the short - term perturbations at @xmath19 ( major perturbation ) and 5757.5 ( minor perturbation ) , which lasted for @xmath20 days and @xmath21 day , respectively .",
    "these short - term perturbations are characteristic features of planetary microlensing @xcite .",
    "the dense temporal coverage from the multiple sites is useful in ensuring that there is no missing feature in the light curve .",
    "also , overlapping observations allows to perform extensive self consistency checks among the data sets . after investigating residuals of all data sets used in the initial fits and correlating them with the observing conditions at the sites ( seeing , sky background , and airmass ) , we carefully remove points for which we are less confident",
    "also , we do not use data sets that add no or little constrain to the light curve  such as data taken during only two or three nights of observations , or data taken during monotonic decline of the event after planetary anomalies .",
    "the procedure of keeping smaller number of confident data points allows us to limit influence of potential systematic errors and increase our confidence in the results , while , due to the redundancy of the gathered data , not harming the discriminatory power of the light curve .",
    "planetary lensing is a special case of the binary lensing where the mass ratio between the lens components is very small .",
    "the description of a binary - lensing light curve requires seven basic parameters .",
    "the first three of these parameters characterize the geometry of the lens - source approach .",
    "these include the time scale for the source to cross the radius of the einstein ring , @xmath22 ( einstein time scale ) , the time of the closest source approach to a reference position of the lens system , @xmath23 , and the lens - source separation at @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( impact parameter ) .",
    "for the reference position of the lens , we use the center of mass of the binary system .",
    "the einstein ring denotes the image of a source for the case of the exact lens - source alignment .",
    "its angular radius , @xmath25 ( einstein radius ) , is commonly used as a length scale in describing the lensing phenomenon and the lens - source impact parameter @xmath24 is normalized to @xmath25 .",
    "another three parameters needed to characterize the binary lens include : the mass ratio between the lens components , @xmath26 , the projected binary separation in units of the einstein radius , @xmath27 , and the angle of the binary axis in respect to the lens - source relative motion , @xmath28 .",
    "the last parameter is the angular source radius @xmath29 normalized to @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath30 ( normalized source radius ) .",
    "this parameter is needed to describe the planet - induced perturbation during which the light curve is affected by the finite size of a source star @xcite .",
    "in addition to the basic binary lensing parameters , several higher - order parameters are often needed to describe subtle light curve deviations .",
    "ogle-2011-blg-0265 lasted nearly throughout the whole bulge season .",
    "for such a long time - scale event , the motion of the source with respect to the lens may deviate from a rectilinear motion due to the change of the observer s position caused by the earth s orbital motion around the sun and this can cause a long - term deviation in the light curve @xcite .",
    "consideration of this , so called `` parallax '' effect , in modeling a microlensing light curve requires to include two additional parameters of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which represent the two components of the lens parallax vector @xmath33 projected on the sky in the north and east equatorial coordinates , respectively . the direction of the parallax vector corresponds to the relative lens - source motion in the frame of the earth at a specific time ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we use @xmath35 .",
    "the size of the parallax vector is related to the einstein radius @xmath25 and the relative lens - source parallax @xmath36 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively .",
    "measurement of the lens parallax is important because it , along with the einstein radius , allows one to determine the lens mass and distance to the lens as @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively @xcite . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 represents the parallax of the source star .",

    "the lens orbital motion affects the light curve by causing both the projected binary separation @xmath27 and the binary axis angle @xmath28 to change in time .",
    "it is especially important for the binary lensing systems whose separation on the sky is close to their einstein ring radius ( as we experience in this event ) .",
    "the shape of the emerging `` resonant caustic '' is very sensitive to the change of the binary separation . also , such caustic is considerably larger than caustics produced by other lens configurations allowing larger part of the lens plane to be accurately probed during the event .",
    "we account for the orbital effect by assuming that the change rates of the projected binary separation , @xmath52 , and the angular speed , @xmath54 , are constant .",
    "this is sufficient approximation as we expect the orbital periods to be significantly larger than the 11-day period between the perturbations seen in the light curve .",
    "since now the binary separation is a function of time , we quote at the tables and use as fit parameters the value of the binary separation ( @xmath49 ) and the binary axis angle ( @xmath50 ) for a specific epoch : @xmath58 . here",

    "the deviation in a lensing light curve caused by the orbital effect can be smooth and similar to the deviation induced by the parallax effect .",
    "therefore , considering the orbital effect is important as it might affect the lens parallax measurement and thus the physical parameters of the lens @xcite .    with the lensing parameters",
    ", we test different models of the light curve . in the first model ( standard model ) , the light curve",
    "is fitted with use of the seven basic lensing parameters . in the second model ( parallax model )",

    ", every source trajectory has its exact mirror counterpart with respect to the star - planet axis  with @xmath59 being the only difference .",
    "however , when the additional effects are considered , each of the two trajectories with @xmath60 and @xmath61 deviate from a straight line and the pair of the trajectories are no longer symmetric .",
    "it is known that the models with @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be degenerate , especially for events associated with source stars located near the ecliptic plane  this is known as the `` ecliptic degeneracy '' @xcite . for ogle-2011-blg-0265",

    "[ fig : five ] , we present the location of the source star in the color - magnitude diagram . using the method of @xcite finding the centroid of the red clump in the 1.5 x 1.5 region of the sky around the source star , we estimate that the source star ( with @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) is @xmath90 mag bluer and @xmath91 mag fainter than the typical red clump giant , and hence , is most likely also a k - type giant star located in the galactic bulge . based on the intrinsic color of the red clump giant stars @xmath92 @xcite",
    ", we estimate the de - reddened color of the source star to be @xmath93 .    with the observed ( @xmath94 ) and intrinsic colors of the red clump stars",
    ", we estimate the total reddening toward the galactic bulge : @xmath95 from @xcite the mean distance to the galactic bulge stars in the direction of the event is 7.8 kpc and the intrinsic brightness of the red clump stars is @xmath96 . with the measured observed brightness @xmath97",
    ", we estimate the extinction to the bulge to be @xmath98 .",
    "this is consistent with the estimated reddening of 2.26 as the slope of the reddening vector ( @xmath99 ) is typically @xmath100 , and in most cases is between 1.0 and 1.4 for the galactic bulge sight lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 7 ) .",
    "the extinction in the @xmath13 band is calculated as @xmath101 .",
    "then , the extinction - corrected magnitudes of the source star are computed as @xmath102      although uncertainties of the observed color and brightness of the source stars are typically low ( in this case 0.01 mag ) , the uncertainty in the centroiding of the red clump and the differential reddening in the field causes that the true intrinsic colors of the microlensing sources are typically known with lower accuracy .",
    "* section 3.2 ) compare the colors of source stars of the 55 microlensing events determined with both spectroscopic and microlensing techniques .",
    "their figure 5 shows that the disagreement between the two estimations is typically 0.07 mag for the blue star sample and 0.08 mag for all stars .",
    "there is no physical reason for the measurement of the color offset from the red clump stars to be less accurate for red stars than for blue stars .",
    "hence , the authors point to , clearly but not perfectly , the color-@xmath103 relations as the source of the increased scatter for red stars ( with @xmath104 k , cf . @xcite , figure 7 ) . the observed 0.07 mag scatter between the spectroscopic and microlensing color estimates also includes",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath103 , which are of the order of @xmath105 k and would generate @xmath106 mag uncertainty in color ( compare with table 5 and figure 7 of @xcite ) . by subtracting this source of scatter in quadrature from the observed scatter ,",
    "we obtain 0.061 mag , which still contains some unknown uncertainty of the stellar models themselves .",
    "the sample of events analyzed by @xcite also contains some problematic events of two types .",
    "one type are the events where the coverage of the light curve in the multiple photometric bands was not sufficient to accurately determine observed color , while the other type are the events in the fields with poorly defined red clumps .",
    "this allows us to argue that for well observed microlensing events in the fields with well defined red clump , the typical error in the microlensing color estimation is on the order of @xmath107 mag .",
    "one could worry that the assumption of a typical error of the intrinsic color estimation does not take into account the influence of the differential reddening , which in fact , varies from field to field .",
    "figure 6 of @xcite addresses this issue , showing that there is no evidence of strong correlation between the differential reddening in the fields of 55 events ( as measured by @xcite ) and errors in their color estimations .",
    "this actually could be understood by realizing that the dominating source of scatter in the observed colors of red clump stars comes from the gradient of the reddening across the field .",
    "this gradient , however , has no effect on the position of the red clump stars centroid .    as an example",
    ", we took samples of stars from four circles centered on our event with the diameters of 1.5 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively , and used them to measure the centroid of the red clump .",
    "all four measurements are within 0.02 mag of each other , even though the measure of the differential reddening ( as defined by @xcite ) is between 0.16 and 0.24 in these circles .",
    "it is also worth noting that any error in the relative position of the source star from the centroid of the red clump that could come from the differential reddening would only partially contribute to the final estimation of the angular size of the star . as we will see in the following section , the calibration of the angular radius of the star contains two terms with opposite signs : @xmath108 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : kf08 ] ) ) . more dust in front of the star influences both estimations of @xmath109 and @xmath110 in the same direction , and since @xmath111 , the overall error that comes from the wrong estimation of the reddening is reduced by 50% ( @xmath112 ) .    the ogle-2011-blg-0265 event is located @xmath113 from the galactic plane in the region strongly obscured by the interstellar dust ( @xmath114 ) and affected by the differential reddening .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the measure of the differential reddening ( @xmath115 ) in the @xmath116 patch of the sky around the event",
    ". the observed @xmath117 colors of the red clump stars show @xmath118 mag dispersion , which leads to the estimation of @xmath119 mag .",
    "however , having the evidence for at most minor influence of the differential reddening on the final estimation of the color , and knowing that only half of the error ( due to reddening ) enters the final result , we only slightly increase our uncertainty of the color from 0.05 to 0.06 mag due to the heavily reddened field .",
    "we expect the error in the estimation of @xmath110 to be slightly higher than the assumed error for @xmath109 . in order to measure the observed brightness of the red clump , the luminosity function of the red giant branch has to be fitted simultaneously with the luminosity function of the red clump giants .",
    "based on the reproducibility of the red clump centroiding under various assumptions regarding the red giant branch luminosity function , we conservatively assume 0.1 magnitude error in the estimation of @xmath110 of the source star .      knowing the dereddened color of the star and the extinction - corrected brightness",
    "enables the use of the surface brightness relation to find the angular radius ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we note that in microlensing we typically measure @xmath109 color , hence , ideally we would like to use a calibration based on this quantity . by including the additional transformation process from @xmath109 to @xmath120 , the uncertainty of the estimated color increases by a factor 1.5",
    " 2.5 ( for example @xmath121 for stars with @xmath122 @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite provide such a relation calibrated with dwarfs and subgiant stars ; we write : @xmath123 where the angular radius is given in @xmath5as and the scatter of the relation is 0.0238 .",
    "the relation in @xmath124 for the same types of stars based on @xcite is @xmath125 and the quadratic relation for the wider range of stars was given by @xcite : @xmath126    @xcite believe that the scatter around the provided relation is dominated by the intrinsic scatter rather than measurement errors .",
    "this yields the relative uncertainty of the angular radius at 5.5% .",
    "calibrations based on an infrared color have much smaller intrinsic scatter , so careful removal of scatter due to measurement error is required .",
    "@xcite estimate the intrisic scatter around the provided relation is 1% , whereas @xcite estimates 1.8% and argues that the accuracy of the star sizes obtained from the infrared - based surface brightness relations is @xmath127 , but higher than the 1% estimated by @xcite .",
    "we note that despite having much smaller scatter , the relations with @xmath120 ( transformed from @xmath109 ) yield higher uncertainty of the angular radius than the relation originally calibrated in @xmath109 , unless the accuracy of @xmath109 estimation is @xmath128 or @xmath129 , where the slope of @xmath124 vs @xmath130 is more shallow .",
    "hence , we use @xcite relation in the ogle-2011-blg-0265 case , which leads to the final estimation of the angular source radius @xmath131    combining the physical and the normalized source radius yields the einstein radius of @xmath132 mas ( for both @xmath60 and @xmath61 solutions of the parallax+orbit model ) .      with the measured einstein radius and the lens parallax , we are able to estimate the physical quantities of the lens system ( table  [ table : two ] ) . for the best - fit solution ( @xmath60 , parallax+orbit model ) ,",

    "they differ in the microlens parallax , especially in the north component @xmath169 ( @xmath60 ) versus @xmath170 ( @xmath61 ) , and also in @xmath54 , which is often strongly correlated with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this difference is important because it leads to a different mass and distance of the host @xmath171 versus ( 0.14 , 3.5 ) for the @xmath60 and @xmath61 solutions , respectively .",
    "the @xmath60 solution is favored by @xmath172 corresponding to a ( frequentist ) likelihood ratio of @xmath173 .",
    "this would be compelling evidence if treated at face value .",
    "however , it is known that the photometry of microlensing events occasionally suffers from low - level systematic trends at @xmath174 few level .    as an additional way to resolve the degeneracy",
    ", we check the ratio of the projected kinetic to potential energy @xcite estimated by @xmath175 where @xmath176 . for typical viewing angles ,",
    "one expects @xmath177 , as is the case for the @xmath60 solution . on the other hand , the lower value @xmath178 ( as in the @xmath61 solution ) implies either that the planet is seen projected along the line of sight at the viewing angle @xmath179 ( corresponding to semi - major axis @xmath180 ) , or that we have just seen the planet when majority of its motion is directly toward ( or away from ) us .",
    "of course , the prior probability of the first configuration for a point randomly distributed on a sphere is just @xmath181 and the probability for the second is similar .",
    "however , while it is certainly true that the prior probability for any given planet s position is uniform over a sphere , this is not the case for planets found by microlensing , which are preferentially detected within a factor @xmath182 of the einstein radius @xcite .",
    "first , since the planet actually lies very near the einstein radius , it would have been detected in almost any angular orientation @xmath28 , so that the actual probability is more like @xmath183 than @xmath184 , i.e. , about 0.11 . in addition , since giant planets around m  dwarfs are a new class of planets , we do not know their distribution .",
    "it could be that the great majority of such planets lie at @xmath185au .",
    "then , whenever these were found in planet - host microlensing events , they would have a very low value @xmath183 . on the other hand ,",
    "whenever we detect them at typical viewing angles , they will be considered as `` free floating planets '' @xcite .",
    "hence , the measurement of a low @xmath183 value is not a strong statistical argument against the @xmath61 solution which still remains as a viable option .    in summary , although both light curve and energy considerations point to the @xmath60 solution , it is difficult to confidently resolve the degeneracy between the two possible models based on the currently available data .",
    "fortunately , the difference in the physical parameters estimated from the two degenerate solutions are not big enough to affect the conclusion that the lens belongs to a new class of giant planets around low - mass stars",
    ".      it will eventually be possible to confidently resolve the current degeneracy issue on the models of ogle-2011-blg-0265 when the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) comes on line in about 10 years . at that time",
    ", the source and lens will be separated by about 40 mas , or roughly 3 fwhm in the @xmath186-band .",
    "there are three observables that can then be used to distinguish the two solutions .",
    "first , the @xmath61 solution predicts a fainter lens because it has a lower mass .",
    "second , it predicts slightly higher heliocentric proper motion ( mainly in the east sky direction ) .",
    "third , it predicts a different angle of the proper motion .",
    "each of these measurements has some potential problems .",
    "the prediction of the lens flux is influenced not only by the mass and the distance but also by the extinction to the lens .",
    "there is a substantial error in @xmath25 that impacts the brightness in the same direction as the mass and distance .",
    "that is , if @xmath25 is higher than we have estimated , then the distance is closer ( so the lens is brighter ) and the mass is greater ( so the lens is brighter again ) .",
    "fortunately , the detection of the lens will itself enable to measure the proper motion @xmath187 and therefore also the einstein radius ( see below ) .",
    "also , with a bigger telescope , it will be possible to better estimate @xmath25 by detailed characterization of the source star , thus , more accurate estimation of the @xmath29 then in eq ( [ eq : theta_star ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ table : two ] , the predictions for heliocentric proper motion differ by only @xmath188 .",
    "this is the same problem as just mentioned : the proper motion prediction contains the significant error of @xmath25 .",
    "by contrast , the angle of heliocentric proper motion , @xmath189 , does not depend on @xmath25 . in terms of observables ,",
    "@xmath190 where @xmath191 is the motion of earth projected on the sky at the fiducial time of the event @xmath192au / yr .",
    "this means that the position angle ( north through east ) is @xmath193 which is indeed independent of @xmath25 .",
    "we find @xmath194 for @xmath60 and @xmath195 for @xmath61 .",
    "thus if the actual measurement is @xmath196 , it will strongly exclude @xmath197 the @xmath61 solution , but if it is @xmath198 then it will only marginally favor @xmath199 the @xmath61 solution .    nevertheless , with three pieces of information , there is a good chance that the ensemble of measurements will favor one solution or the other .",
    "we reported the discovery of a planet detected by analyzing the light curve of the microlensing event ogle-2011-blg-0265 .",
    "it is found that the lens is composed of a giant planet orbiting a m - type dwarf host .",
