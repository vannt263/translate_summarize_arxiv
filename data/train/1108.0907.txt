    "the cryogenic mission of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al .  2004 ) lasted from august 2003 to may 2009 . in that time , the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al.2004 ) made repeated observations of several standard stars .",
    "those fainter than @xmath0 1 jy at 12  could be observed both spectroscopically and on the peak - up ( pu ) subarrays on the short - low ( sl ) module .",
    "it was highly desirable to do so for two reasons .",
    "first , using the target for self peak - up reduced the likelihood of possible pointing errors , because as long as the coordinates were good to within several arcseconds , the on - board pu algorithm would find the source and shift it with its full precision to the center of the spectrographic slits . with an offset star , any errors with the coordinates of _ either _ star translated into a pointing error .",
    "second , the pu observations gave us an independent photometric measurement of the target , allowing us to monitor the stability of both the standard stars and the instrument . if a standard varied in isolation compared to the others , then it probably is a variable star . if all of the standards varied in concert , variation in system response is the likely culprit",
    "table  1 lists the five stars observed most frequently with the red peak - up sub - array during the cryogenic _",
    "these stars were faint enough to not saturate the red pu array , which would have resulted in poorer pointings for spectroscopy , and they were brighter than @xmath0 150 mjy at 16  . for stars below this limit , we used the blue pu sub - array , which gave slightly more accurate pointings due to the smaller point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the responsivity of the two pu sub - arrays , which peak at approximately 16  ( blue ) and 22  ( red ) , along with the actual spectra of the standards considered here .",

    "after the first set , or `` acquisition '' set , the centroid was determined and the telescope moved to shift the target to a well - calibrated portion of the pu array known as the `` sweet - spot '' .",
    "the three `` sweet - spot '' images were then combined and analyzed as before .",
    "the second centroid was then used to shift the target to the first requested spectroscopic slit .",
    "thus , each pu observation results in two combined images and two independent photometric measurements .    early in the mission , we were very conservative about saturating any pixels in the pu sub - arrays , which would reduce the accuracy the centroiding algorithm and introduce possible pointing errors .",
    "consequently , the observations of hd  173511 used offset pus through irs campaign 4 , and the corresponding astronomical observing requests ( aors , 20 in all ) have no pu photometry for this source .",
    "the analysis begins with s18.18 pipeline output from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) .",
    "we use the `` acqr.fits '' files , which are more processed than the raw `` bcd.fits '' files available in previous pipeline versions .",
    "the `` bcd '' images can suffer from what is known as `` jailbarring '' .",
    "the images are read one row of 128 pixels at a time , with 32 reads of four - pixel groups by four parallel analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) .",
    "sometimes the dark current from the four adcs drifts , resulting in vertical stripes in the images .",
    "the `` acqr '' images delivered by the ssc correct this artifact .",
    "we combined the three images from one position using median filtering , and then measured the signal from the target using simple aperture photometry in two ways .",
    "we use a narrow aperture of radius four pixels and a corresponding sky radius of eight pixels , and a broad aperture of radius seven pixels with a sky radius of 14 pixels . in both cases ,",
    "the sky is measured in the outer annulus and removed from the photometry inside the inner circle .",
    "the two apertures produce similar results , but because the photometry in the narrow apertures shows less noise , we concentrate on those results here .    in rare cases ,",
    "the photometry from the `` acquisition '' and `` sweet spot '' images disagree with each other , most likely because of latent images in the sl detector from previous observations . in those cases ,",
    "the acqusition image is far more likely to produce spurious results .",
    "we have filtered the data by using only the second ( sweet - spot ) image when the difference between the two images is greater than 1.5% of their mean . as a result ,",
    "only a handful of data remain outside an envelope of @xmath35% .",

    "all five stars follow the same trend of a decline in signal of @xmath02% from early in the mission to about half - way through , followed by a slight @xmath01% increase in signal from then to the end of the cryogenic mission .",
    "because all five stars vary in unison , we conclude that we are dealing with variation in the system .",
    "we will assume that the issue is a subtle change in responsivity .",
    "any additive offset would have been removed by the sky subtraction .",
    "the spread in the data at any given time is on the order of a few percent , about as large as the apparent trends .",
    "consequently , we do not attempt any kind of polynomial fit to the responsivity as a function of time . instead",
    ", we have separated the cryogenic mission into three phases , each containing approximately equal numbers of photometric measurements and corresponding roughly to the overall breaks in the apparent trends .",
    "table 2 presents the means for each standard for the three phases of the mission , the standard deviation ( @xmath4 ) and the uncertainty in the mean ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the last set of data in the table gives the combined means of all five standards during the mission , weighted to account for the number of observations .",
    "our overall photometric uncertainty is @xmath00.1% , compared to shifts in system responsivity of 1.7% down in the middle campaigns and 1.0% back up for later campaigns .",
    "based on this analysis , we recommend divisive corrections to red pu photometry of 0.9826 ( @xmath60.0007 ) for irs campaigns 1534 and 0.9929 ( @xmath60.0010 ) for irs campaigns 3561 .",
    "these corrections bring all data into line with the early irs campaigns . for most users of the irs , this level of precision for red pu photometry is probably unnecessary , but we will apply these corrections in future technical reports and papers describing the spectrophotometric calibration of the irs and its application to the sample of spectroscopic standards observed during the cryogenic mission .",
    "ludovici et al .",
    "( 2011 ) presented an earlier analysis using s18.7 data at the aas meeting in seattle .",
    "they found corrections within @xmath00.5% of the values presented here with different filtering for outliers and slightly different breaks between campaigns ( the middle group was camp .",
    "analysis of the s18.7 data more consistent with the steps described in section 3 produce results within @xmath00.150.3% of our recommended corrections above , depending on the detailed assumptions .",
    "these differences give a reasonable estimate in our uncertainty .",

    "however , the mean is 0.989 , which is a more significant difference .",

    "we can not claim conclusively that hd  166780 is a variable star , but this change in flux does raise some concerns .",
    "the photometric behavior of @xmath1 lac is also troublesome , but while a similar analysis suggests a 0.7% increase in brightness , the confidence level is only 1.3  @xmath4 , making it impossible to draw any conclusions .",
