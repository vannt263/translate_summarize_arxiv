    "mirror symmetry was first discovered in string theory as a duality between families of @xmath0-dimensional calabi - yau manifolds .",

    "mirror symmetry predicts symmetric properties between mirror pairs .",

    "batyrev  @xcite used @xmath4-regular hypersurfaces in toric varieties associated to reflexive polytopes as a way of constructing a large family of mirror pairs . in this case , the mirror pair consists of the family of @xmath4-regular hypersurfaces associated to a reflexive polytope and the family of @xmath4-regular hypersurfaces associated to its dual polytope .",
    "borisov  @xcite generalized this by considering nef - partitions of reflexive polytopes .",
    "a nef - partition of a reflexive polytope corresponds to a decomposition of the boundary divisor into nef divisors . in this case , the mirror pairs are constructed as the family of complete intersections associated to a nef - partition and the family of complete intersections associated to its dual nef - partition .",
    "these complete intersections are calabi - yau varieties , and their string - theoretic hodge numbers behave as predicted by mirror symmetry  @xcite .    compared to hypersurfaces ,",
    "complete intersections associated to nef - partitions are more complicated .",
    "in particular , they may exhibit nontrivial double mirror phenomenon , i.e. two families of calabi - yau varieties have the same mirror .",
    "if this is the case , the homological mirror symmetry conjecture implies that the derived category of coherent sheaves on the two complete intersections @xmath5 are equivalent .",
    "batyrev and nill  @xcite asked whether toric double mirrors are birational .",
    "we give an affirmative answer to this question in theorem  [ main ] :    * theorem * _   let @xmath6 be toric double mirrors and @xmath7 be the determinantal variety , if they are all irreducible with @xmath8 , then @xmath9 are birational . _    the outline of the proof is as follows : first , we need to decompose the lattice according to nef - partitions . in the process , combinatorial properties of nef - partitions are used in an essential way , and due to the possible non - saturatedness , we have to work in some auxiliary lattices .",
    "then , we construct a determinantal variety by the results of lattice decomposition .",
    "finally , we show that the generic complete intersections are both birational to this determinantal variety , and hence birational to each other . in the proof ,",
    "we use the fact that a generic complete intersection has a compactification which is a calabi - yau variety with canonical , gorenstein singularities .",
    "this is based on @xmath4-regularity .",

    "we give necessary background on reflexive gorenstein cones , nef - partitions , and their relations . in the end of this section ,",
    "we prove proposition  [ conetonef ] which generalizes the relation between nef - partitions and reflexive gorenstein cones .",
    "this will be used to reformulate batyrev and nill s original question in the language of gorenstein cones .",
    "we also give a constructive proof of its converse in proposition  [ neftocone ] . in section  [ sec3 ] , we reformulate the question of batyrev and nill using reflexive gorenstein cones .",

    ", we give the definition of @xmath4-regularity and discuss its properties .",
    "we show that the singularities of @xmath4-regular intersections are inherited from the ambient toric variety .",

    "the purpose of introducing notations @xmath24 will become clear in a moment : if a nef - partition lives in @xmath20 ( or @xmath25 ) , then the corresponding reflexive gorenstein cone will live in @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) .",
    "sometimes we also use lattice @xmath28 and its dual lattice @xmath29 .",
    "the convention is as follows : we always use @xmath20 ( or @xmath25 ) to denote the lattice where _ polytopes _ live , if the _ cones _ come from nef - partitions , we use @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) to denote the lattice where they live . however , when talking about general _ cones _ which do not come from nef - partitions , we use @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) to denote the lattice where they live .",

    "we will see in a moment how reflexive gorenstein cones relate to nef - partitions . before doing this",
    "we should briefly recall the notion of nef - partition . in the projective toric variety defined by a reflexive polytope , a nef - partition is equivalent to a decomposition of the boundary divisor into a summation of nef divisors . on the other hand ,",
    "there exists a purely combinatorial definition of nef - partition without invoking toric variety constructions . for simplicity",
