    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the reliable @xmath1 are measured for 33 type ii agns with significant stellar absorption features .",
    "we use the formula of greene & ho to obtain the corrected stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath4 and smbhs masses are calculated from the @xmath103 relation . a median strong relation between the [ o iii ] luminosity and the smbh mass is found ( although no correlation between the extinction - corrected [ o iii ] luminosity and the smbh mass ) ; no correlation is found between the eddington ratio and the [ o iii ] luminosity or the extinction - corrected [ o iii ] luminosity .",
    "* the gas velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) in nlrs is measured using three sets of two - gaussian profiles to fit [ o iii]@xmath54959 , 5007 and [ o ii]@xmath53727 , 3729 ) in these 33 stellar - light subtracted spectra .",
    "we find that the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath4 becomes much weaker at higher redshifts .",
    "* the distribution of @xmath7 is @xmath8 for the core [ o iii ] line and @xmath9 for the [ o ii ] line , which suggests that @xmath6 can trace @xmath4 within about 0.1 dex in the logarithm of @xmath4 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath6 from @xmath4 is correlated with the eddington ratio .",
