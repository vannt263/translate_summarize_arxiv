    "there are three questions we should ask when we try to construct a model with weak scale supersymmetry ; ( 1 ) how supersymmetry is broken ? ( 2 ) how gauge / matter fields feel the supersymmetry breaking ?",
    "( 3 ) how the higgs fields feel the supersymmetry breaking ? there is a simple mathematical formulation of those questions .",
    "it is all about the interaction terms in the lagrangian among the goldstino multiplet @xmath4 and the fields in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we reconsider problems in supersymmetric models by using the effective - field - theory approach .",
    "the low energy theory is described by the field @xmath4 and the matter / gauge / higgs fields . by doing so",
    ", we can discuss different scenarios as different choices of functional form of @xmath4 which define an effective theory . in this formulation",
    ", we find that there is a sweet spot in between the gauge and gravity mediation ( @xmath5  gev ) where the theory is perfectly consistent with various requirements .",
    "this note is based on  @xcite .",
    "the construction of the low - energy effective lagrangian for supersymmetry breaking sector is completely analogous to the higgs sector in the standard model . in the standard model , the higgs potential",
    "is given by @xmath6 here the higgs field @xmath7 is a linear representation of the gauge group , and can be decomposed to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , three goldstone bosons and a physical field .",
    "this theory makes sense as a low - energy effective theory as long as @xmath8 .",
    "not only as the simplest model of the electroweak symmetry breaking , this model serves as the effective theory of a wide class of models which arises after integrating out heavy fields .",
    "the two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively set the strength of the self - interaction of the higgs fields and the electroweak scale .",
    "the physical mode and gauge bosons get masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "and @xmath13 . if it is a model of supersymmetry breaking by an @xmath14-term and if @xmath15 , the effective lagrangian to describe physics around the minimum is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : susy - breaking]).,width=321 ]    a wide class of supersymmetry breaking models also has a low - energy effective description in terms of the goldstino multiplet @xmath4 , that contains the @xmath14-component vev , the goldstino fermion and a physical scalar field .",
    "the lagrangian is defined by a khler- and a superpotential as follows : @xmath16 we eliminated the possible cubic terms @xmath17 by an appropriate field redefinition so that @xmath18 is the minimum of the potential .",
    "this theory makes sense if @xmath19 . the two parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively set the strength of the self - interaction of the @xmath4 field and the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath22 . the physical mode and",
    "the gravitino obtain masses : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "since we have the standard model of supersymmetry breaking in eq .",
    "( [ eq : susy - breaking ] ) , we do not need to consider detail of mechanisms or dynamics of the supersymmetry breaking for now .",
    "each model of supersymmetry breaking simply maps to a parameter point or region in the two - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we can leave those as parameters in the low - energy theory .      before going to the discussion of the communication between the mssm sector and the supersymmetric sector",
    ", we review here important features of the mssm .",
    "the superpotential of the mssm is @xmath26 where we suppressed the yukawa coupling constants and flavor indices .",
    "the last term , the @xmath27-term , is needed to give a mass to the higgsino , but it should not be too large .",
    "for supersymmetry to be a solution to the hierarchy problem , i.e. , @xmath28 , the @xmath27-term is necessary to be of the order of the electroweak scale ( or scale of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms ) .",
    "this is called the @xmath27-problem .",
    "the fact that @xmath27 is much smaller than the planck scale suggests that the combination of @xmath29 carries some approximately conserving charge .",
    "there are many gauge invariant operators we can write down in addition to the above superpotential such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 these are unwanted operators as they cause too rapid proton decays .    the @xmath27-problem and the proton decay problem above are actually related , and there is a simple solution to both problems .",
    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry with the following charge assignment avoids too large @xmath27-term and the proton decay operators .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 this symmetry is broken explicitly by the @xmath27-term , @xmath34 .",
    "since it is a small breaking of the pq symmetry , the coefficients of the dimension five operators are sufficiently suppressed . the unbroken @xmath35 symmetry , which includes the @xmath36-parity as a subgroup , still forbids the superpotential terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r - breaking ] ) and ensures the stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , leaving us to have a candidate for dark matter of the universe .",
    "in fact , there is another symmetry which can play the same role as the pq symmetry , called @xmath36-symmetry .",
    "the charge assignment is @xmath37 @xmath38 again , @xmath39 explicitly breaks the @xmath36-symmetry down to the @xmath36-parity .    in summary , there are approximate symmetries , u(1)@xmath40 and u(1)@xmath41 , in the lagrangian of the mssm .",
    "if one of them is a good ( approximate ) symmetry of the whole system , it provides us with a solution to the @xmath27 and the proton decay problems .",
    "now we discuss interaction terms between the @xmath4-sector and the mssm sector .",
    "these interactions determine the pattern of supersymmetry breaking parameters which are relevant for low energy physics .",
    "there are actually only three possibilities for gauginos to obtain majorana masses .",

    "the gauge kinetic function @xmath43 is a one - loop exact quantity : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the contributions to the beta - function and masses of heavy fields in the theory , respectively .",
    "the first term is the gauge coupling constant at tree level ( defined by the running coupling constant at a cut - off scale @xmath48 ) .",
    "the last term is the contribution from one - loop correction by light fields . in order for the function @xmath43 to be @xmath4",
    "dependent so that r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : majorana ] ) is non - vanishing  @xcite , we have three choices , i.e. , which term(s ) is @xmath4 dependent ?",
    "each of possibilities has been named as the gravity  @xcite , gauge  @xcite and anomaly mediation  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the tree - level gauge coupling @xmath49 can be @xmath4 dependent if @xmath50 we call this assumption as ` gravity mediation . '",
    "an important feature here is that the @xmath4 field must be singlet under any symmetry even including approximate ones at low energy .",
    "symmetries are either absent or badly broken in order to obtain @xmath51 valued gauge coupling constants for the standard model gauge interactions .",
    "therefore , there is generically a cosmological moduli problem in this scenario  @xcite .",
    "also , the absence of ( approximate ) symmetry makes the supersymmetric cp problem sharper as we see later .",
    "the gaugino masses are @xmath52 the gravitino mass @xmath53 is @xmath54 in this scenario .    the second possibility , making the second term @xmath4-dependent , is called ` gauge mediation . ' the unique possibility of making this term @xmath4-dependent is @xmath55 the heavy fields whose masses depend on @xmath4 are called messenger fields .",
    "the simplest possibility is to take @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a dimensionless constant . in this case , in contrast to gravity mediation",
    ", @xmath4 can carry a charge since @xmath58 would only shift the @xmath59-term leaving the gauge coupling constant unchanged .",
    "we can , therefore , assign a ( anomalous ) u(1 ) charge to the @xmath4 field .",
    "( the @xmath60 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : susy - breaking ] ) breaks this symmetry explicitly .",
    "this explains the smallness of the scale of supersymmetry breaking @xmath61 which is consistent with the assumption made before ( @xmath62 ) . for small values of @xmath21",
    ", we can regard the u(1 ) symmetry as an approximate symmetry of the lagrangian . )",
    "the gaugino masses are  @xcite @xmath63 the gravitino mass is @xmath64 in this scenario .",
    "note that @xmath4 must have a vev to be consistent if we take the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mheavy ] ) .",
    "the third possibility is called ` anomaly mediation . ' in the supergravity lagrangian with a requirement that the cosmological constant is vanishing , dimensionful parameters in the lagrangian are accompanied with the compensator field @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the third term effectively becomes @xmath4-dependent : @xmath67 the gaugino masses are @xmath68 therefore , @xmath69 in this scenario .",
    "what we can do is to choose at least one of the above three for the functional form of the gauge kinetic function @xmath70 . for matter fields ,",
    "we need to choose wave function factors @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the interaction terms we can write down are @xmath74 we expand @xmath75-functions as @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 where we have rescaled the fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 such that the kinetic terms are canonically normalized . by an appropriate shift we also take @xmath81 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are complex parameter whereas @xmath87 and @xmath88 are real . then soft terms are obtained to be @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath22 and @xmath53 are related by @xmath93 .    for natural electroweak symmetry breaking , we need @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the electroweak scale @xmath97 .",
    "also , to suppress cp violation at low energy we need @xmath98    in gravity mediation , all the coefficients are expected to be non - zero and @xmath51 in the unit of @xmath99 since we can not assign any charge to @xmath4 . the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) can be naturally explained in this case .",
    "this is the giudice - masiero mechanism in gravity mediation  @xcite .",
    "however , at the same time , there is no reason to expect the cp phase above to be small .",
    "the simplest possibility of realizing a small phase is to take @xmath100 at an energy scale .",
    "this is possible if we can arrange @xmath101 the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) implies @xmath102    the above general discussion is suggesting that @xmath4 field carries some approximately conserving charge . if we assign the pq - charge @xmath103 we can naturally explain @xmath104 .",
    "gauge mediation is consistent with this hypothesis for generating gaugino masses because @xmath4 can carry an anomalous u(1 ) charge and @xmath53 is small .",
    "note that anomaly mediation predicts @xmath105  tev ( see the last term in eq  .([eq : bmu - general ] ) ) which is inconsistent with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) and ( [ eq : bmu ] )",

    "the size of @xmath107 should be such that @xmath108 in gauge mediation , this means @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the general picture we obtain is that _ supersymmetry breaking sector and the higgs fields are directly coupled above some energy scale @xmath107 and the combined sector should respect the approximate pq - symmetry_.    a framework with gauge mediation @xmath110 approximate pq symmetry @xmath110 the giudice - masiero mechanism seems to be a good starting point according to the discussion of the @xmath27-term , proton decays and the cp problem .",

    "( [ eq : mu - gm ] ) to be both @xmath54 , we need to explain a relation : @xmath111 if there is a reasonable explanation for this coincidence in a stabilization mechanism of @xmath4 , this hypothesis is going to be a perfect framework .",
    "we summarize three mediation mechanisms in table  [ tab : scenarios ] .",
    "there have been many attempts to circumvent problems summarized in table  [ tab : scenarios ] .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it has been proposed to extend a model of gauge mediation to the nmssm by introducing a new singlet field",
    "however , for the successful electroweak symmetry breaking , further extension of the model were necessary such as introduction of vector - like matters .",
    "similar attempts have been done in ref .",
    "@xcite in anomaly mediation models .",
    "the gaugino mediation  @xcite is a variance of the gravity mediation and known to be a successful framework for solving the flavor problem .",
    "however , since the model relies on the @xmath112 term for the gaugino masses , the moduli problem and the cp problem remain unsolved . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a mixture of anomaly and gauge mediation is proposed as a solution to the tachyonic slepton problem ( see also @xcite ) . the idea is to modify the structure of the anomaly mediation by introducing an additional light degree of freedom , @xmath113 .",
    "it is claimed that the @xmath27-problem and the tachyonic slepton problem can be solved by assuming appropriate couplings of @xmath113 to the messenger and higgs fields .",
    "however , it is unclear whether such a light degree of freedom is consistent with cosmological history .",
    "we here propose a simple set - up to address all of the problems .",
    "the assumptions we make are the following : ( 1 )  there is an approximate pq symmetry whose small explicit breaking triggers the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "( 2 )  the higgs fields and the supersymmetry breaking sector are directly coupled above an energy scale @xmath114 . ( 3 )  there are messenger particles which obtain masses by a vev of @xmath4 .",
    "the effective lagrangian written in terms of the goldstino multiplet @xmath4 and the mssm matter / gauge fields are then given by  @xcite : @xmath115 the chiral superfield @xmath116 represents the matter and the higgs superfields in the mssm , and @xmath117 is the yukawa interaction terms among them .",
