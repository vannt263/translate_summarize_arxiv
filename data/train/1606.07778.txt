    "the main goal of the present paper is to add the class of irreducible artin - tits groups of spherical type ( modulo their center ) to this list .",
    "this will be achieved by studying the natural action of an irreducible artin - tits group of spherical type on the additional length graph associated to its classical garside structure .",
    "let us briefly recall what that means .",
    "_ artin - tits groups of spherical type _ ( or generalized braid groups ) are a generalization of the classical artin braid group : it was shown in @xcite that they enjoy a combinatorial structure analogue to that first discovered for braids by garside @xcite ( the _ classical garside structure _ of the braid group ) . more generally , _",
    "garside groups _ can be roughly defined as groups satisfying analogues of garside s combinatorial properties @xcite .",
    "a prominent feature of garside groups is the biautomatic structure , provided by normal forms which allow to solve the word and conjugacy problems .    motivated by the example of the classical artin braid group ( which is a close relative of the mapping class group of a punctured sphere ) acting on the curve graph of the punctured sphere , the authors provided in  @xcite a combinatorial construction of the _ additional length graph _ associated to any garside group  @xmath0 , equipped with a garside structure of finite type .",
    "this additional length graph @xmath11 is a connected , gromov - hyperbolic graph which admits an isometric action of  @xmath0 . in the special case",
    "where @xmath0 is the artin braid group endowed with its classical garside structure , it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath11 has infinite diameter : this was accomplished by exhibiting a family of braids which act loxodromically on @xmath12 ; on the other hand , periodic and reducible braids were shown to act elliptically on the additional length graph .",
    "it was left as an open problem in  @xcite to give conditions on the garside group @xmath0 for its additional length graph to have infinite diameter . here",
    "we give a partial answer , settling completely the case of artin - tits groups of spherical type ( endowed with the classical garside structure ) :    [ t : infdiam ] the additional length graph @xmath11 associated to the classical garside structure of an artin - tits group of spherical type @xmath0 has infinite diameter if and only if @xmath0 is irreducible .",
    "the `` only if part '' of theorem  [ t : infdiam ] results from an easy computation , see proposition  [ p : onlyif ] .",
    "the strategy to show the reverse implication is quite similar to the proof of .",
    "it is based on the construction ( theorem  [ t : lox ] ) of a specific element  @xmath1 of  every irreducible @xmath0 whose action on the graph @xmath11 is loxodromic .",
    "the center of an irreducible artin - tits group of spherical type is known to be cyclic , generated by a distinguished element @xmath13 .",
    "the element @xmath13 turns out to act trivially on @xmath11 , hence the action of @xmath0 descends to an action of @xmath2 . in this context we shall prove :    [ t : wpd ] for each irreducible artin - tits group of spherical type endowed with its classical garside structure , the element @xmath14 acts wpd on the additional length graph @xmath11 .",
    "here , the property referred to is the so - called _ weak proper discontinuity _ introduced by bestvina - fujiwara in  @xcite ( we refer to section  [ s : acylindrical ] for the definition ) .",
    "in other words , as @xmath11 is gromov - hyperbolic , theorem  [ t : wpd ] says that @xmath2 satisfies property ( ah3 ) of theorem 1.2 in osin s paper  @xcite . this can be restated in the following way :    [ t : acylindrical ] if @xmath0 is an irreducible artin - tits group of spherical type , then @xmath2 is acylindrically hyperbolic .    finally , we deduce some consequences regarding the genericity of loxodromically - acting elements in an irreducible artin - tits group of spherical type @xmath0",
    ". there are two commonly used ways of `` picking an element of  @xmath0 at random '' .",
    "the first is to make a long random walk in the cayley graph of  @xmath0 , the second is to pick a random point from a large ball centered on the neutral element in the cayley graph of  @xmath0 .",
    "we prove that with either of these two notions , the probability of picking an element which acts loxodromically on  @xmath12 tends to  @xmath15 exponentially quickly as the length of the random walk , or the size of the ball respectively , tends to infinity .",
    "the main tools used in these proofs come from @xcite in the random - walk setting , and from @xcite and @xcite in the large - ball setting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : reminders and first results ] we recall some basic facts about garside groups , artin - tits groups , and the additional length graph . in section  [ s : lox ] we construct the element @xmath1 and prove theorem  [ t : infdiam ] .",
