    "quantum secret sharing ( qss ) is a general multi - partite information security scheme that attracts extensive research interests  @xcite .",
    "it allows one dealer to distribute a secret among a number of players in such a way that a certain set of players can reconstruct the secret by taking operations collaboratively and exchanging information .",
    "in contrast to quantum key distribution  @xcite that guarantees the secure communication between only two parties , qss enables multiple parties to communicate securely at the same time .",
    "qss has its origin in classical information theory .",
    "an early scheme was given in  @xcite to share either classical or quantum secret to three or four players by using the ghz states .",
    "@xcite studied general threshold schemes to share quantum secrets and showed that the quantum no - cloning theorem is the only constraint on the existence of threshold schemes . ref .  @xcite",
    "further extended the results to general access structures , including non - threshold schemes .",
    "these researches have established theoretical foundations for many ensuing investigations , _",
    "e.g. _ hybrid schemes  @xcite and twin - threshold schemes  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , graph state has been extensively studied in applications such as quantum error correction  @xcite , entanglement purification  @xcite , entanglement measurement  @xcite , and bell inequality  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the implementation of qss with graph state was introduced in  @xcite to treat three kinds of threshold qss schemes in a unified graph state approach and to propose embedded protocols in large graph states .",
    "@xcite generalized the results to prime dimensions , and ref .",
    "@xcite investigated non - threshold schemes . however , all these results are based on discrete variable graph states",
    ".    here we are interested in qss with continuous variable graph state ( cvgs ) .",
    "cvgs was first introduced in  @xcite as the continuous analogue of discrete variable graph state .",
    "it has the nice property that any local gaussian operation on a cvgs can be associated with a geometric transformation on its graph representation  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that cvgs can be used to generate universal quantum operations and thus is potentially a useful physical resource to implement quantum computations .",
    "in addition , cvgs also finds applications in quantum communications , _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a protocol to realize quantum teleportation between two parties .",
    "this paper is focused on the implementation and property analysis of qss schemes with cvgs .",
    "we differentiate eight qss schemes according to the secret and communication channel types . among all these schemes ,",
    "four of them have no practical values because they are either physically infeasible or insecure .",
    "we will thus investigate in the other four schemes .",
    "these extend the works in  @xcite into the cvgs domain .",
    "we study two essential problems for these qss schemes with cvgs first , for each qss scheme , we design an implementation protocol for the dealer and players so that the players may collaborate to estimate the secret .",
    "the mean and variance of the estimation error are derived explicitly .",
    "based on the error statistics , we can derive the parameter settings for unbiased estimation .",
    "furthermore , the protocol parameters can be tuned to minimize the error variance . in the case of infinite squeezing",
    ", it can be shown that finding the condition that a set of players can perfectly estimate the secret can be transformed to solve a set of linear equations .",
    "the second problem is the threshold protocol , which is crucial for many applications that need decision - making . in qss",
    ", a @xmath0 threshold protocol refers to the case when @xmath1 players or more can estimate the secret perfectly , and any set with less players can never get the secret within a finite error bound . we show that an arbitrary @xmath0 threshold protocol with @xmath2 can be implemented for three schemes using a weighted cvgs prepared with infinitely squeezed qumodes .",
    "an interesting observation is that for the scheme with quantum secret , private distribution channel , and quantum player - player channel ( referred as qprtq ) , the threshold protocol for two non - cooperative player groups is exclusive , meaning that if one group can perfectly estimate the secret qumode , the other can not estimate either quadrature of the secret qumode within a finite error bound .",
    "the security of the quantum secret is thus gurantteed .",
    "for qprtq and another scheme , these protocols cover all the physically feasible cases , and we also reveal the duality between them .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in this section we give a brief introduction of qss schemes and cvgs .     threshold protocol . ]    in a qss protocol , there are one dealer and @xmath3 players as shown in fig .",
    "the dealer has a secret that is represented by either classical or quantum information . at first",
    ", the dealer encodes the secret into a prepared quantum state , and subsequently distributes it to all the players through either private or public channels . with this quantum state at hand",
    ", a group of players can either apply local operations to their own states and then exchange classical information , or take joint operations to their states .",
    "the task for these players is to reconstruct the secret based on the information circulated around .",
    "we can classify qss into eight schemes according to their secret type ( classical or quantum ) , dealer - player distribution channel ( private or public ) , and player - player communication channel ( classical or quantum ) . among all these eight schemes , qpubc and qprtc are physically infeasible because it is impossible to recover unknown quantum information from classical information . moreover ,",
    "qpubq and cpubq are insecure because an eavesdropper can disguise identity to modify the information on public channel .",

    "even if less than @xmath1 of the @xmath127 qumodes are removed , any @xmath1 players holding the reserved qumodes can still obtain the secret .",
