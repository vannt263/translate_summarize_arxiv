    "the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing , which is responsible for cp violation in the nmssm , is triggered by five phases in these matrix elements , namely , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath95 .",

    "the mass of the next - to - lightest neutral higgs boson , on the other hand , is found to vary by 40 % for @xmath95 between 0 and @xmath252 .",
    "this indicates that the neutralino contributions are not negligible for some parameter values .",
    "we then plot the dependence on @xmath95 of @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 in figs .",

    ", there is a complex phase and only two scalar - pseudoscalar mixing elements .",
    "as the relevant complex phase varies between 0 and @xmath254 , it is found that one of the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing elements in the mssm increases as much as twice its value at zero complex phase , due to the neutralino contribution [ 3 ] .    in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture on the amount of mixing between scalar higgs bosons and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , which is directly linked to the amount of cp violation the the higgs sector of the nmssm",
    ", we would not only examine the magnitudes of @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 , but also examine the relative sizes of them against the other matrix elements .",
    "the ratios of the mixing matrix elements to the non - mixing matrix elements would tell us the relative importance of the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing elements .",
    "we define the ratios of mixing matrix elements to non - mixing ones by @xmath255 where @xmath256 are ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 3,4 ) , ( 1,5 ) , ( 2,5 ) , and ( 4,5 ) and @xmath257 are ( 1,2 ) , ( 1,4 ) , ( 2,4 ) , and ( 3,5 ) .",
    "the number of matrix elements that do not mix the cp states is 4 : @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , and @xmath261 .",
    "since we have 6 mixing matrix elements , the number of possible ratios in the nmssm is 24 , whereas in the mssm there are just two ratios .    in figs .",
    "4a to 4h , we plot all of these 24 ratios of the mixing matrix elements to the non - mixing ones , as functions of @xmath95 , for the same parameter values as fig .",
    "we check that the absolute values of non - mixing elements @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , and @xmath261 are much larger than 1 ( gev)@xmath253 for figs .",
    "these ratios vary largely as @xmath95 varies from 0 to @xmath254 . on all figs .",
    "4a to 4h , these ratios reach their peak values at the values of @xmath95 where the mixing matrix elements themselves become extremum values .",
    "> from figs . 4",
    ", one may deduce that for a particular set of parameter values the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing matrix elements are comparable in size to the non - mixing matrix elements .    on the other hand",
    ", we can randomly explore the parameter space to check the values of @xmath262 .",
    "this is because the results in figs .",
    "4 might not faithfully represent the whole parameter space of the nmssm , since , up to now , our analysis is carried out for a specific set of parameter values ( except @xmath95 ) .",
    "thus , we would like to search in more detail the meaningful region of the parameter space in order to see if the mass matrix elements can be still comparable in size there .",
    "the boundaries of the region of the parameter space we search are defined by @xmath263 and @xmath264 we evaluate @xmath262 at a point in this region , which represent naturally a given set of parameter values .",
    "we take three values of @xmath95 : @xmath265 , @xmath266 , and @xmath267 . for each value of @xmath95",
    ", we choose 20,000 points by monte carlo method in the above region , and at each point 24 @xmath262 are evaluated .",
    "thus , for each value of @xmath95 , we obtain 480,000 numbers for @xmath262 .",
    "we put these 480,000 numbers into four categories for convenience : @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 , and @xmath271 . in table 1 , we count them and list the result",
    ". one can see in table 1 that , for example , for @xmath265 , 188 of 480,000 @xmath262 are larger than 1 .",
    "it can roughly be said that the larger @xmath262 are the larger mixings between cp states become . > from table 1 , it is apparent that we have clearly more large @xmath262 for @xmath272 than for @xmath273 . the number of large @xmath262 , larger than 0.1 , increases as @xmath95 changes from 0 to @xmath274 . this may be interpreted as the effect of @xmath95 , the complex phase in the neutralino sector .    .",
    "for each of @xmath95 = 0 , @xmath275 , and @xmath276 , we evaluate 24 @xmath262 at 20,000 points in the region of the parameter space defined in the text .",
    "the 480,000 values of @xmath262 are classified into four categories .",
    "we list the counts in each category . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now , we turn our attention to the @xmath243 orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "this orthogonal matrix also contains pieces of information about the cp violation and the mixing between scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "the elements @xmath277 determine the couplings of the physical neutral higgs bosons to other fields in the nmssm . in figs .",
    "5a and 5b , we plot as a function of @xmath95 , for the same parameter values as fig .",
    "2 , the squares of @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 , which link the cp - even and cp - odd states . one can see that @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 fluctuate widely for @xmath281 , while the remaining ones remain nearly zero .",
    "therefore , for the particular set of parameter values , it is possible to expect that neutralino contributions may affect seriously the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings in the nmssm .",
    "note that , in our analysis , @xmath265 does not imply the absence of cp violation , because there are other non - zero complex phases , i.e. , @xmath239 .",
    "meanwhile , one can evaluate effectively the size of the cp violation by measuring the dimensionless parameter [ 6 ] @xmath282 the range of @xmath283 is from 0 to 1 since the elements of the transformation matrix satisfy the orthogonality condition of @xmath284 = 1 .",
    "if @xmath285 , there is no cp violation in the higgs sector of the nmssm . on the other hand , if @xmath286 , cp symmetry is maximally violated .",
    "the maximal cp violation that leads to @xmath283 = 1 takes place when @xmath287 = 1/5 . in fig .",
    "6 , we plot @xmath283 , as a function of @xmath95 , for the same parameter values as fig .",
    "2 . one can observe that @xmath283 reaches to @xmath288 for certain values of @xmath95 .",
    "this shows that it is possible for the neutralino sector to play a dominant role in the cp violation in the nmssm at the one - loop level , through the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings , at least for the particular set of parameter values .    here ,",
    "too , we explore the parameter space randomly and check the value of @xmath283 .",
    "the regions of the parameter space is the same as the aforementioned one for @xmath262 .",
    "we take 19 values of @xmath95 from 0 to @xmath252 . for each value of @xmath95",
    ", we choose 20,000 points in the region and evaluate @xmath283 , and take the largest value among them .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "7 , where the maximum value of @xmath283 , say @xmath289 , for each @xmath95 is plotted .",
    "we see that @xmath289 is considerably large for a wide range of @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the cp violation can be significantly affected by the presence of @xmath95 . without the neutralino contributions in the nmssm ,",
    "the explicit cp violation at the one - loop level might be considerably reduced .",
    "we now estimate the dependence on @xmath95 of the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson @xmath290 in more detail .",
    "we first choose randomly a point in the region of the parameter space defined above .",
    "we check at this point if the condition of @xmath291 gev , ( @xmath292 = 1 to 4 ) is satisfied .",
    "then , we change only the value of @xmath95 arbitrarily while fixing other parameter values of the point : this defines another point .",
    "we check at the new point too if the condition of @xmath291 gev , ( @xmath292 = 1 to 4 ) is satisfied . if so , we keep the two points as a pair .",
    "let the values of @xmath95 of a given pair of the two points be @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "now , at each of the the two points , we evaluate the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson , @xmath290 , and introduce the ratio of the mass values as @xmath295 for @xmath296 , and @xmath297 for @xmath298 . in this way",
    ", we always have @xmath299 .",
    "note that @xmath300 implies the independence of the lightest neutral higgs boson mass on @xmath95 , i.e. , on the neutralino contributions .",
    "we select @xmath301 pairs of points randomly in the aforementioned region of the parameter space and evaluate @xmath302 for each pair .",
    "we plot the 20,000 points of @xmath302 against @xmath303 in fig .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "8 that only a few of the points are scattered away from the line of @xmath304 .",
    "this indicates that for most of the parameter region the @xmath95 dependence of the lightest neutral higgs boson mass is weak . in other words ,",
    "the neutralino contributions to the lightest neutral higgs boson mass in the nmssm are rather small .",
    "the masses of other neutral higgs bosons behave similarly .",
    "thus , one might say that the masses of the five neutral higgs bosons are roughly independent on the cp phase of the neutralino sector .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of explicit cp violation at the one - loop level in the neutral higgs sector of the nmssm , where the tree - level higgs potential is assumed to possess cp symmetry .",
    "the mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , which induce the cp violation , occurs via the radiative corrections at the one - loop level . for the radiative corrections",
    ", we consider the loop contributions due to top quark , bottom quark , tau lepton , @xmath71 boson , @xmath126 boson , the charged higgs boson , five the neutral higgs bosons and their superpartners . with those contributions ,",
    "five phases appear .",
    "they are : @xmath84 from the scalar top quark sector , @xmath85 from the scalar bottom quark sector , @xmath86 from the tau lepton sector , @xmath87 from the chargino sector , and @xmath95 from the neutralino sector .",
    "the effects of cp violation in the nmssm at the one - loop level may manifest themselves in many places : the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons contain some elements that mix cp - even and cp - odd fields .",
    "some elements of the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons have also carry information about the cp violation",
    ". they will be zero if cp is conserved .",
    "the five complex phases are all responsible for , and contribute to , the cp violation .",
    "we pay attention to @xmath95 , and examine the size of contributions from the neutralino sector to the matrix elements relevant for the cp violation in the nmssm at the one - loop level .",
    "as @xmath95 is allowed to vary from 0 to @xmath252 while the other complex phases are fixed , we can see the dependence on @xmath95 of the cp violation . from figs . 2 to fig .",
    "6 , we observe that for a certain set of parameter values most of the relevant quantities that we examine depend significantly on @xmath95 .",
    "one of the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing matrix elements change from nearly zero to as large as more than 10,000 ( gev)@xmath253 , depending on @xmath95 .",
    "actually , the absolute values of these scalar - pseudoscalar mixing matrix elements do not convey more useful information than the relative sizes among the mixing matrix elements and non - mixing matrix elements .",
    "the ratios of the mixing matrix elements and non - mixing matrix elements are examined .",
    "they also depend clearly on @xmath95 , exhibiting the neutralino contributions .",
    "some of them approach to 1 , for certain value of @xmath95 , and many of them are larger than 0.01 for a wide range of @xmath95 .",
    "the results imply that the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing matrix elements may be comparable in sizes to the non - mixing matrix elements , for a certain set of parameter values in the nmssm , due to the neutralino contributions at the one - loop level .",
    "the masses themselves of the five neutral higgs bosons are not so affected by @xmath95 , at least for the certain set of parameter values .",
    "the elements of the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons carry more direct information on the cp violation than the mass matrix itself . as can be seen in figs .",
    "5 , some of the matrix elements @xmath305 fluctuate very widely between 0 and 1 , depending on @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , @xmath283 , which is a quantity that measures directly the amount of the cp violation , is also checked .",
    "it is found that @xmath283 is larger than 0.01 for some values of @xmath95 , whereas @xmath283 is nearly zero when @xmath306 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that the neutralino sector at the one - loop level dominantly contributes the cp violation in the nmssm , for a certain set of parameter values .",
    "we also explore a meaningful region of the parameter space by monte carlo method in order to check the above observations are not confined to the particular set of parameter values . in the parameter region , we pick randomly 20,000 points for given @xmath95 to evaluate @xmath283 at them .",
    "we choose the largest of them and denote it @xmath289 for given @xmath95 .",
    "it is found that @xmath289 shows a clear dependence on @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , @xmath289 at @xmath306 is definitely smaller than @xmath289 at non - zero @xmath95 values .",
    "actually , for some values of @xmath95 , @xmath289 close to as large as 0.29 . to conclude",

    "<S> the tree - level higgs potential can be made cp conserving by assuming that all the relevant parameters are real . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cp - conserving higgs potential at the tree level may still develop complex phases at the one - loop level through radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> these complex phases exhibit explicit cp violation through the mixings between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons . </S>",

    "<S> the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings are found to strongly dependent on this phase . </S>",
