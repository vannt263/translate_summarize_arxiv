    "our motivation comes from three seemingly unrelated problems .",
    "the first is the problem of _ floating bodies of equilibrium in two dimensions_. from 1935 to 1941 , mathematicians at the university of lviv , among them stefan banach and mark kac , collected mathematical problems in a book , which became known as the scottish book , since they often met in the scottish coffee house .",
    "stanislaw ulam posed problem 19 of this book : `` is a sphere the only solid of uniform density which will float in water in any position ? '' the answer in the two - dimensional case , as it turns out , depends on the density of the solid .",
    "the second problem , known as the _ tire track problem _ , originated in the story , `` the adventure of the priory school '' by arthur conan doyle , where sherlock holmes and dr .",

    "the problem is : `` is it possible that tire tracks other than circles or straight lines are created by bicyclists going in both directions ? ''",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : ambitrack ] , the answer to this subtle question is affirmative .",

    "the main requirement turns out to be that , in the language of discrete differential geometry , the polygon is `` self - darboux '' .",
    "that is , the discrete differential geometric notion of a discrete darboux transformation @xcite , which relates one polygon to another , relates a discrete bicycle curve to itself .",
    "the topic of bicycle curves and polygons belongs to a number of active areas of research . on the one hand , it is part of rigidity theory . as an illustration , r. connelly and b. csiks consider the problem of classifying first - order flexible regular bicycle polygons @xcite",

    "the topic is also part of the subject of discrete integrable systems .",
    "this point of view is taken in @xcite , where the authors find integrals of motion ( i.e. , quantities which are conserved ) of bicycle curves and polygons under the darboux transformation and recutting of polygons @xcite .    in this paper , in analogy with bicycle polygons , we introduce a new concept called a periodic discrete bicycle path and study both its rigidity and integrals .",
