    "globular cluster ( gc ) systems are major tracers for studying the formation and early evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "they are also useful for studying the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) because they provide us with large nearly single - aged and mono - metallicity populations of stars located at the same distance which means that the only significant difference between the stellar populations in different clusters is the mass and metallicity of the clusters .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ( @xmath0 ) ratio is an important parameter of a gc as it establishes a connection between the luminous and gravitating mass of a population .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of a gc is mostly due to the small number of evolved stars , while the mass is dominated by the more numerous unobserved low - mass stars and possibly stellar remnants .",
    "this implies that the m / l ratio of a gc reflects its present - day mass function ( mf ) , and hence through its evolution also the imf .    for a simple stellar population , in which all stars are formed in a single - metallicity instantaneous burst , the stellar @xmath0 ratio depends on the age and the imf . in the beginning",
    ", a large fraction of the mass in the cluster can be found in high - mass stars ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) . as a result of stellar evolution ,",
    "the fraction drops and the high - mass end of the mass function turns into compact remnants .",
    "the total luminosity of a star cluster which is due to the high - mass stars drops by an order of magnitude within the first 2 gyr and by roughly another order of magnitude within the next 10 gyr of evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 ratio increases constantly as the most luminous stars disappear .",
    "while stellar evolution only raises the @xmath0 ratio of a stellar population with time , on the other hand , dynamical evolution leads to a decrease of the @xmath0 ratio because of the preferential two - body relaxation driven evaporation of faint , low - mass stars ( i.e. , high @xmath0 stars ) for star clusters evolving in a tidal field of a host galaxy . within the last decade the structural parameters and kinematical properties of extragalactic gcs with distances up to a few tens of mpc have been well measured .",
    "for example , strader et al . ( 2009 , 2011 ) presented the observed velocity dispersions for 200 gcs in m31 using new high - resolution mmt / hectochelle spectra and covering a wide range of cluster masses and metallicities . for 163 gcs of this sample",
    "they have derived the @xmath0 values in both the optical ( v - band ) and near infrared ( k - band ) . since line blanketing increases with metallicity ,",
    "stellar population synthesis predicts fainter optical luminosities for more metal - rich clusters , while there is no similar dependence expected in the k - band .",
    "they found that the m / l ratios are lower than what is expected from the stellar population model predictions with a canonical stellar imf .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed @xmath3 and the ssp model is larger at high metallicities where the @xmath3 values fall below the ssp values , by a factor of more than three .",
    "moreover , this discrepancy is more pronounced for clusters with a lower mass and for clusters with a shorter two - body relaxation time scale ( strader et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "there are two ways to reduce @xmath0 : adding stars with low @xmath0 ratios ( i.e. , @xmath4 stars ) , or removing stars with high @xmath0 ratios ( low - mass dwarfs ) .",
    "different imfs for metal - poor and metal - rich clusters are proposed by strader et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to explain the @xmath1 $ ] relation of m31 gcs .",
    "most recently , shanahan & gieles ( 2015 ) showed that the mass segregation bias in @xmath5 as a function of [ fe / h ] can explain the observed discrepancy in @xmath0 between the dynamical and ssp models , without invoking the depletion of low - mass stars , or variations in the imf .",
    "this scenario is supported by the discrepancy between the observed @xmath5 and the ssp models being more pronounced for low - mass clusters with a shorter two - body relaxation timescale ( strader et al .",
    "2011 ) , because dynamical mass segregation is a more efficient process in clusters with lower mass .",
    "however , ignoring the effect of two - body relaxation driven evaporation of low - mass stars is nearly valid only in clusters with a long two - body relaxation time - scale , and for gcs that are older than their half - mass relaxation time - scale the depletion of low - mass stars should be included .",
    "despite all the evidence for a universal imf ( e.g. , kroupa 2001 ; kroupa 2002 ; bastian et al .",
    "2010 ) , recently several indications have begun emerging for a possible environment dependency of the shape of the imf .",
    "several observational and theoretical indications suggest the imf to become top - heavy under extreme starburst conditions ( marks et al .",
    "2012 , dabringhausen et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 , 2012 ; see kroupa et al .",
    "2013 for a review on the evidences for the top - heavy imf ) .",
    "the data suggest the imf to become less top - heavy with increasing cluster metallicity and decreasing density .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to assess the different scenarios for explaining the @xmath1 $ ] discrepancy and to constrain the most reliable of them .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "2 we investigate if only dynamical evolution is able to explain this discrepancy . in sec .",

    "figure [ dynamic ] shows the observed @xmath0 ratio of m31 gcs versus their metallicity [ fe / h ] in the v- and k - bands ( strader et al .",
    "2011 ) . in order to compare with the theoretical expectation from ssp models , we overplot the ssp models for both optical and near - infrared @xmath0 ratios assuming an age of 12.5 gyr and the canonical imf using the flexible stellar population synthesis code ( fsps , marigo et al .",
    "2008 , conroy et al 2009 ; conroy and gunn 2010 ) , in which the padova isochrones and the basell stellar library are utilized .",
    "the canonical ( @xmath6 ) imf , @xmath7 , can be conveniently written as a two - part power - law function , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 for stars with mass @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 ( kroupa 2001 , kroupa et al .",
    "2013 ) with the upper mass - limit of 100 @xmath15 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ dynamic ] ( solid line ) , no strong dependence of @xmath16 on metallicity is expected for ssp models , while @xmath3 increases significantly with metallicity .",
    "an observed trend of strongly decreasing @xmath16 values with increasing metallicity for m31 gcs can be seen , while only a minimal dependency of @xmath16 values on metallicity is expected from ssp models ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 2003 ; maraston 2005 ; conroy & gunn 2010 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath3 ratios of metal - rich gcs deviate strongly from the ssp models which predict fainter luminosities and larger @xmath3 ratios for more metal - rich systems .",
    "the stellar population models only account for the effects of stellar evolution , whereas dynamical evolution and preferential depletion of low mass ( i.e. , high @xmath0 ) stars through two - body relaxation , mass segregation and evaporation from evolving gcs changes the shape of the stellar mf within a cluster @xcite , causing the @xmath0 ratio to decrease . in order to take the dynamical evolution into account we follow the n - body results of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) and",
    "estimate the effect of dynamical evolution on the stellar mf - slope of m31 gcs .",
    "the dissolution time of star clusters on circular orbits can be expressed as ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) :    @xmath17^{x}\\frac{r_g}{[kpc]}\\left(\\frac{v_g}{200 km / sec } \\right)^{-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 ( giersz & heggie 1996 ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for king @xmath21 clusters ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) . the initial number of stars , @xmath22 , is calculated from the initial mass of clusters assuming a mean stellar mass of @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that the exact value of the mean mass depends on the assumed imf .",
    "in addition , it is varying in the simulated clusters because the mass function changes during the evolution .",
    "but , the change is only marginal and does not affect the nature of the conclusions .    in order to iteratively calculate the initial mass of individual clusters ( using eqs .",
    "10 and 12 of baumgardt & makino 2003 ) to produce a cluster with the present - day mass after 12.5 gyr , one needs the orbital parameters of each cluster which are not yet available . to estimate the the initial masses of the clusters we refer to table 2 of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) where 10 clusters are listed for which orbital information and determinations of the slope of the mass function are simultaneously available . according to their table 2",
    "the mean value of the initial mass over the current mass is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the present - day mass ( as given in table 4 of strader et al .",
    "2011 ) and @xmath26 is the initial mass of the cluster .",
    "we assume a mean value independent of @xmath26 because , although more massive clusters evaporate their stars on a longer time scale than low - mass clusters , if it were the case that the initially more massive clusters were more centrally concentrated in the proto - galaxy therewith being subject to a stronger tidal field , this bias would be reduced .",
    "for example , arp  220 has a central star - burst in very massive forming clusters with an abnormally high supernova rate there ( dabringhausen et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) ; our own milky way has very massive and very young central clusters ( arches and quintuplet , e.g. portegies zwart et al .",
    "2010 ) ; the nearby disk galaxy m33 has been suggested to have a radially systematically decreasing most - massive young star - cluster population ( pflamm - altenburg et al .",
    "2013 ) ; and many galaxies have central nuclear clusters .",
    "therefore we assume for this analysis that the above mean value is independent of @xmath26",
    ". for each individual observed cluster we assume that @xmath27 is a random number which is generated from a gaussian distribution with a mean value of 3 and standard deviation of 1.5 .    since only the projected galactocentric radius of each m31 gc is available ( caldwell et al 2009 ) , calculating the dissolution time and consequently the dynamical evolution of a cluster in a realistic tidal field is uncertain .",
    "assuming clusters move on eccentric orbits with an eccentricity of @xmath28 , the life times of clusters , @xmath29 , decrease as a function of eccentricity compared to clusters moving on circular orbits with radius equal to the apogalactic distance of the eccentric orbit as    @xmath30    since the orbital shapes of m31 gcs are unknown , we assume that these clusters are following eccentric orbits with an average eccentricity of @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume they are likely near the apocenter to estimate the maximum effect of dynamical evolution .",
    "it has been shown that the slope of the stellar mass function at time @xmath32 and in the low mass range , @xmath33 , changes in a universal way , independent on the orbital shape of the cluster as ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) @xmath34    this is used here to estimate the impact of dynamical evolution on the stellar @xmath0 ratio of each individual gc assuming @xmath35 gyr .",
    "note that the change in the slope of the mass function in the mass range @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) over time is negligible and is more noticeable at the low - mass part ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is because of the dynamical mass segregation that the high - mass stars sink into the inner region of the cluster and experience a weak tidal field , while the low - mass stars that are distributed in the outer regions preferentially escape due to the external tidal interaction ( see e.g. , baumgardt & makino 2003 and haghi et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "figure [ dynamic ] depicts the observed @xmath0 ratios of m31 gcs and the prediction of ssp models with ( red plus symbols ) and without ( solid lines ) adding the effect of dynamical evolution . to calculate the position of the red symbols we first assume the initial ( i.e. birth ) @xmath0 ratio of an observed cluster ( black dots in fig .",

    "if the model captures reality well , then the so - calculated @xmath0 values ( the red crosses ) ought to lie close to their corresponding black dots .",
    "basically we expect dynamical evolution to decrease the @xmath0 ratios , but this decline is not metallicity dependent and does not show any trend of the @xmath0 ratios with @xmath39 $ ] , neither in the @xmath41 nor in the @xmath42-band .",
    "in other words , although the dynamical evolution leads to a decrease of the stellar @xmath0 ratios from what is predicted by ssp models , it does not provide the observed trend between @xmath0 and metallicity .",
    "we therefore conclude that standard dynamical evolution alone is not the reason for the observed discrepancy between the observed data and the ssp models , confirming the conclusion by strader et al ( 2011 ) .",

    "adams & fatuzzo ( 1996 ) on the other hand discuss the possibility that because there is no single jeans mass per cloud , a stellar mass grows to a final mass through a balance between accretion rate and self - generated energy feadback , both of which are metallicity and density dependent with the same general metallicity dependence of the stellar mass as in the above jeans - mass argument . in very dense star - forming cores",
    ", pre - stellar cores may coalesce before they form proto - stars thus leading to a top - heavy imf ( dib et al .",

    "these fundamental theoretical arguments lead to the expectation that the imf ought to become metallicity dependent by being more top - heavy ( i.e. , flatter ) in metal - poor and denser environments .",
    "it was disconcerning that until recently observational data did not indicate this long - expected imf variation ( kroupa et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "indeed , the inferred imf slope at the high - mass end , @xmath13 , for a sample of mw gcs suggests that the high - mass imf was more top - heavy ( flatter ) in more massive and denser environments ( see figs 2 and 3 of marks et al .",
    "this implies that denser and to a lower extend metal - poorer systems form more massive stars compared to the canonical imf ( see also weidner et al 2013 and kroupa et al .",

    "this star formation efficiency is remarkably consistent with very detailed @xmath22-body modelling of well observed very young star clusters ranging in mass from @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "the k- and v - band @xmath0 ratios from the ssp models , calculated as in sec . 2 but here assuming a top - heavy imf and corrected for the effect of dynamical evolution but retaining all stellar remnants in the @xmath35 gyr cluster model are compared to the observed values in figure [ top ] .",
    "although , the top - heavy imf now leads to a @xmath1 $ ] trend ( especially in the k - band , compare with fig .",
    "[ dynamic ] ) , the predicted @xmath0 values ( red crosses ) are still larger than the observed values ( black dots ) .",
    "as can be seen , even the effect of dynamical evolution can not sufficiently reduce the @xmath0 ratios to become consistent with observations , and there remain a large number of gcs with observed @xmath0 ratios that are lower than the predicted ones by ssp models with a top - heavy imf .",
    "it should be noted that so far we kept 100% of the stellar remnants within the clusters which leads to higher @xmath0 ratios , because the remnants contribute to the mass without any contribution to the luminosity .",
    "however , it is still unclear how many remnants receive a velocity kick at formation and get ejected immediately .",
    "some recent studies have shown that even if black hole ( bh)-formation kicks are not sufficiently high to eject bhs from young gcs a significant fraction of the formed bhs are expelled through stellar - dynamical evolution up to the typical ages ( 12 gyr ) of the gcs @xcite .",
    "this implies that the assumption of a 100% retention fraction is not reasonable for gcs .",
    "if bhs receive similar velocity kicks as neutron stars ( nss ) upon formation , and if not all nss receive a high kick , a retention fraction of 30% for all remnants may be assumed . keeping 30% of all bhs and nss within the clusters we recalculate the @xmath0 ratios from ssp models with a top - heavy imf . as shown in fig .",
    "[ top-30 ] , the improvement with respect to the panels in fig .",
    "[ dynamic ] is considerable .",
    "the use of the top - heavy imf in ssp models , and of the dynamical evolution and partially keeping the remnants in gcs contribute to this improvement .",

    "[ top - strong ] .",
    "such an enhanced metallicity dependent top - heavy imf may be argued for , given that the original formulation ( eq .",
    "4 ) can at present only be seen as a first approximation as derived from gcs by marks et al ( 2012 ) .             according to fig .",
    "[ top - strong ] , metal - rich gcs still typically show lower @xmath3 values than expected from ssp values .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by the bias in the inferred mass from the integrated light properties ( as a result of the assumption that mass traces light ) that underestimates the true mass , especially at high metallicities as recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "another possibility could that the higher main sequence turn - off mass of metal - rich gcs ( for clusters of the same age ) leads to less mass in remnants ( sipple et al 2012 ) .",
    "for instance , for an initial stellar mass of 50 @xmath15 , the maximum black hole mass is about 28 @xmath15 for a metal - poor ( @xmath39\\simeq -2 $ ] ) progenitor and it is about 12 @xmath15 for a metal - rich ( @xmath39\\simeq 0 $ ] ) star ( belczynski et al .",
    "2006 , sippel et al .",
    "this suggests that the lower observed @xmath3 ratios of metal - rich gcs in m31 , may be a result of the smaller contribution of remnants in high - metallicity clusters , and also a spread in the retention fraction of nss and bhs .",
    "so far , we assumed that the retention fraction is the same for all clusters , while this fraction could vary in principle with the cluster escape velocity .",
    "in fact , for a given kick velocity dispersion of remnants the retention fraction of each remnant type depends on the local escape velocity , which is related to the cluster mass and radius as @xmath57 . in order to estimate the dependency of the retention fraction on the cluster mass the mass - radius relation from larson ( 2004 , @xmath58 ) or marks & kroupa ( 2012 , eq . 5 here ) can be used .",
    "regardless of the exact form of the mass - radius relation it can be easily shown that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , for a given kick velocity dispersion , the remnant retention fraction is set by the cluster mass , in a way that stellar remnants can be retained in massive clusters and therefore can have a significant impact on the cluster evolution affecting the m / l ratios . since the exact form of the kick velocity distribution is still a matter of debate , in order to show the influence of the cluster - mass dependency of the retention fraction on the @xmath1 $ ] curve we assume the retention fraction to be changed linearly from zero ( for the lightest massive cluster in our sample ) to 0.7 ( for the most massive cluster in our sample ) as a function of the cluster initial mass .",
    "[ mass - dependeny ] shows that the change is only marginal and does not affect the nature of the conclusions .    as a final and perhaps most realistic model we adopt eq . 4 for the variation of the imf and additionally we assume the retention fraction of remnants ( @xmath61 ) to be dependent on the metallicity ,    @xmath62)=-0.16 [ fe / h]+0.08,\\ ] ]    such that the retention fraction of stellar remnants runs linearly from 0.4 at @xmath39=-2 $ ] to zero at @xmath39=0.5 $ ] .",
    "we furthermore assumed that 50% of all white dwarfs ( wds ) leave their star clusters due to dynamical evolution and stellar - astrophysical processes @xcite .",

    "7 ) and derive the inferred @xmath0 value of each gc in m31 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ top - metal - dep1 ] such a model well reproduces the observed distribution of @xmath0 values of m31 gcs in both v- and k - bands .",
    "note that the agrement between our models and the data can be improved further if the wds are also assumed to follow the same metallicity - dependent retention fraction as bhs and nss ( fig .",
    "[ top - metal - dep2 ] ) .",
    "observations show a shallow decline of @xmath0 ratios in the v- and k - band with increasing metallicity for m31 gcs , while higher @xmath3 ratios are expected from ssp models due to the evolution of both mass and luminosity .",
    "also , a minimal dependency of @xmath16 on metallicity is expected from ssp models . in this paper",
    "we have presented a possible scenario to explain the discrepancy between the observed @xmath0 ratios of a large sample of gcs in m31 and those predicted by ssp models as found by strader et al .",
    "the main conclusions of these calculations can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "first , we added the effect of standard dynamical evolution to the result of ssp models calculated with a canonical imf in order to investigate if such an effect can explain the growing difference between the @xmath0 ratios in the v- and k - bands with increasing metallicity for m31 gcs .",
    "the evolution of the stellar mf is computed by considering the fitting functions derived by baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) based on comprehensive direct n - body experiments .",
    "we found that , although the dynamical evolution leads to a decrease of the @xmath0 ratio as a result of dynamical mass segregation and evaporation of low - mass stars from the star clusters in a tidal field of a host galaxy , this effect alone can not describe the observed anticorrelation between the @xmath0 ratios and metellicity for the m31 gcs .",
    "we next investigated the impact of a top - heavy imf on the results .",
    "we used the recently derived top - heavy imf as a function of the density and metallicity of embedded clusters , in which star formation leads to a more top heavy imf in denser and metal - poorer pre - gc cloud - cores ( eq .",
    "4 ) , and showed that keeping 30% of the remnants ( i.e. , bhs and nss ) within the clusters , the standard dynamical evolution can significantly reduce the discrepancy between the observed @xmath1 $ ] relation of m31 gcs and those predicted by such ssp models . we furthermore showed that assuming the retention fraction of remnants to be correlated with the cluster initial mass can remarkably improve the agreement of the calculated @xmath0 values in the v- and k - bands to the observation by decreasing the predicted @xmath0 ratios .",
    "we showed that a stronger dependence of the top - heaviness on the metallicity ( eq .",
    "5 ) can also improve the consistency between the theoretical @xmath0 values and the observed ones .",
    "this conclusion can be looked at from another perspective : if the observed @xmath1 $ ] anticorrelation of m31 gcs is a result of a top - heavy imf , then this may be interpreted as a new constrain on the strength of the dependency of the top - heaviness of the imf on the metallicity of the progenitor giant molecular clouds .",
    "4 .   finally and perhaps",
    "most realistically , we assumed the variation of the imf as under point 2 above and in addition we assumed the retention fraction of stellar remnants depends on metallicity ( eq .",
    "such models reproduce the observed distribution of @xmath0 values of m31 gcs in the v- and k - bands best .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , although the lower than expected @xmath0 values of the milky - way gcs can be explained by the depletion of low - mass stars as a result of dynamical evaporation ( kruijssen & miske 2009 ) , here we show that this effect alone can not be the only reason for the observed @xmath1 $ ] anticorrelation of the m31 gcs , and our calculations suggest that a metallicity dependent top - heavy imf might be necessary for the initial conditions of very massive star clusters . such a dependency has been constrained by mark et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that , with our approach we are making some simplifying assumptions .",
    "for instance , our computations of the effect of dynamical evolution is based on some simplifying assumption on the average orbital parameters of the m31 gcs , and some rough estimations for the initial masses of the clusters from their present - day masses . investigating this problem for each individual gcs by direct n - body simulations or any other faster @xmath22-body methods ( e.g. , the monte carlo method )",
    "can provide an improved estimation of dynamical evolution on the @xmath0 ratios of gcs assuming a varying imf and a possibly metallicity - dependent retention fraction of stellar remnants .",
    "it should be noted that in baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) the clusters moved through an external galaxy that followed a logarithmic potential .",
    "however , this potential is a good assumption for clusters moving in the outer part of the host galaxy ( @xmath63 kpc ) , for the clusters orbiting in the inner part the effect of disk and bulge should be taken into account .",
    "moreover , in baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) all remnants that in principle have a significant impact on the evolution and dissolution rate of star clusters are assumed to be escaped .",
    "further simulations would be required in the next future to modify the results of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) incorporating the dynamical effect of retained remnants and a more realistic model for galactic halo on the dynamical evolution .    as we mentioned above , since only the projected distance from the galactic center is available for each m31",
    "gc , it is challenging to calculate their expected evolution due to the degeneracy in orbits of gcs and the resulting differences in tidal forces .",

    "<S> we find that the ssp models with a top - heavy imf , retaining a metallicity- and cluster mass- dependent fraction of the remnants within the clusters , and taking standard dynamical evolution into account can successfully explain the observed @xmath1 $ ] relation of m31 gcs . </S>",
    "<S> thus we propose that the kinematical data of gcs can be used to constrain the top - heaviness of the imf in gcs . </S>"
