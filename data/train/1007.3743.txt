    "star - forming galaxies follow a tight ( @xmath16dex scatter ) correlation between their gas phase oxygen abundance ( hereafter referred to as `` metallicity '' ) and stellar mass @xcite .",
    "this mass - metallicity relation  is primarily understood to be a sequence of oxygen _ suppression _ , rather than enrichment @xcite .",
    "the production of oxygen traces the production of stars , implying that the observed trend in the oxygen - to - gas ratio reflects either a trend in the galaxy gas - to - stellar mass ratio or in processes that affect gas - phase metals but not stars .",
    "a consensus is emerging that although galaxy gas fractions can and do affect the mass - metallicity relation , if the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is the same in all galaxies , then outflows that are more efficient at removing metals from low - mass galaxies are required in order to reproduce the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the global properties of these outflows and the physics underlying how star formation drives them are not well understood  and winds are expensive and difficult to observe directly . in this paper , we incorporate the most recent observations of galaxy gas fractions and the mass - metallicity relation  at @xmath17 into a simple chemical evolution model to explore what constraints can be placed on how the efficiencies and composition of star formation driven galactic winds scale with galaxy stellar mass and halo virial velocity .",
    "several analytic studies have concluded that star formation driven outflows are crucial to reproducing the observed mass - metallicity relation .",
    "@xcite used a simple analytic chemical evolution model to argue that the star formation rate , @xmath5 , and the outflow rate , @xmath4 , should be roughly equal . while @xmath4 and the gas accretion rate @xmath18 vary with the star formation rate ( and thus gas fraction ) , @xmath3 and @xmath19 are constant universal parameters , a common practice in analytic models of galaxy chemical evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "though models specifically aimed at duplicating observations of the mass - metallicity relation  commonly assume @xmath20 , @xcite argues that metal - enriched outflows ( those comprised predominantly of type  ii supernova ejecta , and thus with @xmath21 ) are required if the rate of gas accretion is to be reasonable .",
    "more recently , @xcite have argued that the @xmath2 mass - metallicity relation  together with gas fractions derived by inverting the kennicutt - schmidt ( k - s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) law imply that not only are outflows required , but that they must be more efficient at removing metals from low - mass galaxies than from more massive ones .",
    "@xcite drew a similar conclusion by analyzing a suite of cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations evolved with gadget-2 @xcite in conjunction with detailed analytic models .",

    "these simple scaling relations highlight a link between a galaxy s stellar mass , its halo mass , and its potential well : wind models aimed at successfully reproducing the mass - metallicity relation  also need to correctly reproduce ( or incorporate ) the @xmath15-@xmath29relation .",
    "moreover , this analysis shows that the mass - metallicity relation  is a potentially powerful tool for constraining how star formation driven outflows scale with galaxy and halo properties ; this is particularly interesting as such scalings are currently not well constrained through either direct observations or theoretical considerstions .",
    "on the other hand , several models focus instead on the efficiency of star formation as a function of stellar mass . in such models ,",
    "an increase in the star formation efficiency with galaxy mass  without the need for outflows  is sufficient to reproduce the observed mass - metallicity relation@xcite .",
    "@xcite used a set of sph simulations evolved with gasoline @xcite  and therefore a different recipe for star - formation feedback than @xcite to argue that preferentially expelling gas from the low - mass galaxies is insufficient for reproducing the observed mass - metallicity relation .",
    "these authors claim that it is instead the reduced star - formation efficiency ( and thus differences in galaxy gas fractions ) induced by such feedback that is primarily responsible for driving the relation s morphology . in the context of the mass - metallicity relation ,",
    "variations in the star formation efficiency affect galaxy gas fractions ( as well as the @xmath15-@xmath29  relation ) .",
    "we do not directly address star formation efficiency here because we take both galaxy gas fractions and the @xmath15-@xmath29 relation as givens rather than something to be constrained by the model ; we discuss in appendix  [ app : gas ] the implications our choices for these relations have on how star formation efficiency varies with galaxy mass .",
    "finally , letting the imf ( and thus the amount of oxygen produced per unit stellar mass ) vary with galaxy mass provides a straightforward way to reproduce the mass - metallicity relation@xcite .",
    "we primarily assume here that the imf is the same in all galaxies , with a brief discussion in  [ sec : igimf ] of how uncertainties in yields in the presence of a variable imf affect our results . in general ,",
    "if the imf is top - light in low - mass galaxies then this will imply that outflow efficiencies do not need to scale as steeply with mass as suggested by the non - varying imf case .",
    "we apply here a simple model with which to understand the mass - metallicity relation  to the mass - metallicity relation  at @xmath17 , where external constraints such as gas fractions and the stellar mass function are best measured .",
    "we do not assume a particular form for the mass - metallicity relation ; we instead base our conclusions on the range of parameter space allowed by the range of systematic uncertainties in interpretting strong nebular emission lines as oxygen abundances (  [ sec : mzrs ] ) .",
    "our main simplifying assumptions are that the metallicity of gas accreted from the intergalactic medium is negligible and that the nucleosynthetic yield is constant with galaxy mass . with these constraints and assumptions ,",

    "though varying @xmath33 does change the number density of massive halos , it has little impact on the range of halo masses of interest here",
    ". finally , we note that the virial relations only have a mild change in normalization when varying cosmological parameters , without having much impact on our overall results .",
    "since oxygen is effectively produced only in type  ii sne  the deaths of massive , short - lived stars  and h@xmath34  regions are associated with ongoing star formation , the gas - phase `` mass - metallicity relation '' typically refers to only the galaxy s oxygen abundance in gas that is currently forming stars ; we therefore will use `` metals '' and `` oxygen '' interchangeably unless otherwise noted .",
    "however , though @xmath35  is measured at the sites of star formation , the measured abundances are the _ birth _ abundances of the h@xmath34  regions ; supernovae ( the sites of oxygen production ) destroy their nascent clouds , rendering so - called `` self enrichment '' of h@xmath34  regions extremely rare .",

    "this can be explicitly seen by comparing the blue and orange lines in the bottom panel for the d02 mass - metallicity relation ; moreover , because the difference between these two curves is greater at larger galaxy mass , it implies that in this case outflows would have to be _ more _ efficent at removing metals from massive galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , however , the uncertainties in the oxygen production of core - collapse supernovae , @xmath73 , the imf , and the normalization of the mass - metallicity relation  all conspire to make drawing strong conclusions over the nature of outflows in the case of a varying yield extremely difficult .",
    "supernova - driven galaxy outflows are comprised of some combination of supernova ejecta and ambient interstellar medium entrained in the outflow .",
    "the fraction @xmath97 of entrained gas determines wind metallicity @xmath8 . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : modmzr ] , the wind metallicity @xmath8 is usually assumed to be equal to the ism metallicity @xmath9 when modeling the mass - metallicity relation , but if the outflowing supernova ejecta entrains very little gas ( which would dilute the wind metallicity ) then @xmath8 could be much higher than @xmath9 .",

    "low normalization mass - metallicity relations require @xmath135 for all relevant masses ; if the true nucleosynthetic yield is larger than our fiducial value ( @xmath136 ) , then the efficiency with which galaxies expel metals will have to be even stronger .",
    "thus if normal quiescently star forming galaxies are not expelling winds with @xmath10 , then the data prefer a low nucleosynthetic yield and a high normalization of the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "furthermore , because the mass - metallicity relation  shifts to lower normalizations at higher redshifts , galaxies at these epochs must have either stronger winds or higher gas fractions than their @xmath2 counterparts",
    ".    in  [ sec : igimf ] , we explored the possibility that the nucleosynthetic yield @xmath117 could vary with star formation rate and thus @xmath15 .",
    "while the possible @xmath88 relations are still highly uncertain and the models are much more susceptible to the @xmath53-@xmath15 relation , we find that a wide range of such models have outflows that are more efficient in _ high _ mass galaxies than in lower mass galaxies .",
    "observations of such a trend would be compelling evidence that @xmath117 varies strongly with galaxy mass .",
    "the morphology of the mass - metallicity relation  has two main features : the slope below @xmath137 and the turnover at higher masses . in the constant @xmath117 case ,",
    "the slope of the mass - metallicity relation  largely determines how @xmath40  scales with galaxy mass , though with some degeneracies with the normalization and constant offset . for small @xmath53 , as is the case at @xmath2 , @xmath40  should scale roughly as @xmath138to@xmath139 .",
    "the power - law scaling of @xmath40 with respect to @xmath6 is typically @xmath140 .",
    "the required scalings with respect to @xmath15 are fairly robust , while the scaling with respect to @xmath6 depends on our assumed @xmath15-@xmath29 relation ; if this relation is significantly different from that derived from the abundance matching technique , then the @xmath11 scaling might be able to be relaxed .",
    "regardless , this need for a high and mass - dependent wind efficiency is in broad agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the turnover in the mass - metallicity relation  at @xmath141 may be an observational artifact of the metallicity indicators saturating at high @xmath9 (  [ sec : mzrs ] ) ; however , if oxygen abundances do asymptote to a particular value at high masses , then this behavior can be used to place strong constraints on galaxy outflow properties . specifically , both the normalization of the mass - metallicity relation  relative to the yield ( @xmath142 $ ] ) and the effects of @xmath6 increasing sharply above @xmath143 ( figure  [ fig : halos ] ) must be then taken into consideration ; moreover , the interplay between these effects can place stronger constraints on viable models than just considerations of the mass - metallicity relationbelow @xmath49 .",
    "morphologically , a turnover in the mass - metallicity relationmeans that either @xmath120 or @xmath40 can not be approximated as a power - law .",
    "because cold gas fractions are observed to roughly follow a power - law with respect to @xmath15 , then @xmath40 needs a constant offset @xmath144@xmath145 , depending on which indicator is used to calculate the mass - metallicity relation  and/or the yield . in several cases , if @xmath146 , then @xmath40 can be described as a power - law ; physically , this would imply that galaxies above @xmath147 have large reservoirs of ionized gas that are able to efficiently transfer mass with colder , star - forming gas .    if @xmath40 and @xmath12 scale differently , then the fraction of entrained ism in the wind fluid will vary with galaxy mass .",
    "observationally this will be seen as @xmath102 varying with mass .",
    "as the morphology of the mass - metallicity relation  constrains the scaling of @xmath40 with mass , the scaling of @xmath8 and thus @xmath12 with mass therefore depends on the slope of the mass - metallicity relation . for example ( see figure  [ fig : zw ] ) , for a fixed @xmath12 , a steep mass - metallicity relation  will lead to a shallower @xmath8-@xmath15 relation than a shallower mass - metallicity relation  will . however , since current uncertainties in the slope of the mass - metallicity relation  are smaller than uncertainties in how ( or if ) @xmath12 scales with mass , measurements of @xmath8 across a large range in galaxy mass , especially above @xmath147 , will be particularly useful for constraining how @xmath12 ( and @xmath40 ) scale .      at @xmath2 , the assumption that accreting material has a negligible metal content ( i.e. , that @xmath127 and therefore @xmath119 ) may not be entirely safe .",
    "the igm is enriched as early as @xmath148 @xcite , and if this material is re - accreted onto galaxies at later epochs it could have a significant effect on the shape and normalization of the @xmath2 mass - metallicity relation .",
    "the re - accretion of winds ( i.e. , gas with @xmath149 ) is a significant component of accreted gas in cosmological sph simulations @xcite . though the total accretion rate scales with halo mass ( @xmath150 , see appendix  [ app : gas ] )",
    ", the contribution of accreted metals to the mass - metallicity relation  may not scale so steeply @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an extra source of metals @xmath118 will imply that the overall efficiency of outflows ( i.e. , the amplitude of @xmath40 ) will need to be even higher than the ones presented here .",
    "however , the reaccretion of wind material seen in sph simulations may be sensitive to numerical issues in the wind implementation ; more detailed investigations are needed to verify the importance of wind - recycling .",
    "the metal budget available for re - accretion depends on both the amount of metals expelled at higher redshifts and the recyclying timescale .",
    "we will address the metal content of winds at @xmath151 as implied by the evolution of the mass - metallicity relation  in a later paper .",

    "the observed kennicutt - schmidt ( k - s , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) relation is commonly used to indirectly estimate gas masses in star - forming galaxies in chemical evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , when direct gas masses are expensive ( or currently impossible ) to achieve ( such as at high redshifts , * ? ? ? * ) , or for large samples of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    there are several interesting behaviors in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : fcold ] worth noting .",
    "first , the morphology of @xmath195 is fairly robust against variations in the ssfr and @xmath12 : it is roughly constant , perhaps with a slight rise , for @xmath196 , i.e. , below about @xmath147 , and then drops precipitously at higher masses .",
    "physically , this is a restatement of galaxies with masses near @xmath147 being more efficient at turning gas accreted by their halos into stars , relative to either more or less massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath197 for low - mass galaxies . at face value",
    ", this would imply that all the accreting gas is available for star formation .",
    "this closely resembles so - called `` cold - mode '' accretion scenario in which gas falling into lower mass halos along filaments do not experience significant shock - heating , thereby easily accreting onto the central galaxy @xcite . at higher masses , on the other hand , accreting gas may be shock - heated and subsequently unable to cool and contribute to star formation . despite this neat picture , however , we find it intriguing that @xmath195 is so close to unity at low masses .",
    "figure  [ fig : fg ] clearly shows that @xmath198 in these same galaxies falls short of accounting for all of the baryons in the halo by at least a factor of two .",
    "thus , a large part of the accreted baryons must be removed from the halo via strong winds , even if the star formation is reasonably inefficient in these galaxies , possibly induced by a particularly strong supernova feedback efficiency .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : sfe ] builds on this analysis to show the star formation efficiency , traditionally - defined as @xmath193 , as a function of stellar mass for the total cold gas fractions and the three choices of ssfr . in all cases ,",
    "star formation is more efficient in more massive galaxies : they are forming more stars per unit gas ( though see @xcite ) .",
    "several previous analyses of the mass - metallicity relation  have suggested that a varying star formation efficiency with galaxy mass is required in order to reproduce the mass - metallicity relation(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : sfe ] shows that this condition is implicitly passed as long as gas fractions are decreasing with galaxy mass and star formation rates vary reasonably with stellar mass , as is observed for @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "we note , however , that with proper choices of @xmath40 , the mass - metallicity relation  is _ theoretically _ able to be reproduced with a constant @xmath53  and therefore constant star formation efficiency .",
    "the instantaneous change in the stellar mass , @xmath199 is given by the creation of stars ( @xmath5 ) and the rate at which stars return mass to the ism when they die , @xmath200 .",
    "( we include the mass of stellar remnants in @xmath15 . )",
    "the relative rate of these two effects , @xmath201 , depends on the star formation history and therefore varies somewhat with time ; its effect on our results , however , is small , and we are safe to adopt @xmath202 .",
    "the gas mass is also regulated by the star formation rate and @xmath203 , with gas accretion adding gas and outflows removing gas from the system .",
    "the instantaneous change in @xmath194 is therefore @xmath204 where @xmath18 is the gas accretion rate and @xmath4 is the mass rate of outflowing gas . as introduced in ",
    "[ sec : winds ] , we define the mass - loading factor @xmath12 as @xmath205 ; analogously , @xmath19 . the sources and sinks of metals are essentially the same as for gas , except that each component can have a different metallicity .",
    "hence , @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the metallicity of accreting gas , @xmath9 is the ism metallicity , @xmath208 is the metallicity of gas being returned to the ism by dying stars , and @xmath8 is the metallicity of outflowing gas . the yield @xmath117 is the nucleosynthetic yield , which is defined as the rate at which metals are being returned to the ism relative to the current star formation rate , i.e. , @xmath209 after the first generation of type  ii supernovae explode ( @xmath210yr ) , @xmath117 is constant for continuous star formation ; we adopt a mid - range value of @xmath75 .    since we are interested in the mass - metallicity relation  at @xmath2 , and not its rate of change , it is useful to eliminate the time - dependence in equations  ( [ eqn : mstardotexplicit][eqn : mzdot ] ) .",
