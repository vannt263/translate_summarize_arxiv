    "in the minimal standard model the couplings of the @xmath8-bosons to the quarks are given in terms of the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , @xmath9 , which arises from diagonalizing the quark mass matrices .",
    "in the minimal standard model ( _ i.e. _ , one higgs doublet ) it is this matrix that is responsible for the @xmath10 nonconservation observed in kaon decay",
    ". a precise determination of the elements of the ckm matrix will play an important role in testing this picture for the origin of @xmath10 violation , and will constrain extensions of the standard model that make predictions for the form of the quark mass matrices .",
    "the present value of the @xmath11 element of the ckm matrix , @xmath12 @xcite arises from a comparison of the endpoint region of the electron spectrum in semileptonic @xmath1 decay with phenomenological models . in recent years",

    "it has been shown that the same matrix elements determine the rate for @xmath17 in the region where the photon energy is near its maximal value @xcite . in principle , experimental information on @xmath17 can be used to predict the electron spectrum in the endpoint region of semileptonic @xmath1 decay , leading to a model - independent determination of @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method for getting a precise model - independent value for @xmath0 using exclusive @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "our approach gives a value of @xmath0 that ( apart from some very small factors ) is valid in the limit of @xmath18 flavor symmetry ( on the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks ) or in the limit of @xmath22 heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry @xcite ( on the @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks ) .",
