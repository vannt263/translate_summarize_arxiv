    "the success in the application of group - theoretical methods to the theory of two - dimensional integrable systems @xcite is not accidental .",
    "it is connected with the circumstance that the operations of multiplication of the group elements from left and right are mutually commutative .",
    "it allows us to associate with two commutative differential operators @xmath1 , @xmath2 of two dimensional space infinitesimal displacement generators dependent upon one parameter from left and right in such a way as to solve trivially the representation of zero curvature type .",
    "the foundation of the whole construction is the group valued function : k = m(x)n(y),[leznov : eq-1 ] where the group valued elements @xmath3 , @xmath4 are constructed by definite simple rules , containing only operations in one dimensional spaces @xmath5 respectively .",
    "many different attempts have been made to generalize this construction to the multidimensional case by substituting instead of @xmath5 in ( [ leznov : eq-1 ] ) some multidimensional functions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and considering the consequences which follow from the associated multidimensional @xmath8@xmath9 pair formalism",
    ". however no interesting nontrivial integrable system has been discovered in this way .",
    "moreover the solutions which arise in such a construction ( in the concrete examples considered ) are always only particular but not general .",
    "the reader can find the corresponding literature in  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we want exploit the following observation .",
    "it is always possible to represent general solutions of integrable systems following from ( [ leznov : eq-1 ] ) in local form . or in other words to obtain the general solutions of such systems only the operation of differentiation is necessary ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the operation of integration arises only on the middle step of calculations and may be eliminated from the final result .",
    "this means that if we have a multidimensional space with two mutually commutative operators of differentiation @xmath10 , @xmath11 we will be able to use the two dimensional construction to obtain nontrivial multidimensional integrable systems together with their general solutions .",
    "the aim of the present paper is in the explicit construction of multidimensional manifolds with such properties .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section  2",
    "we discuss general properties of the operators of differentiation and obtain the equations they define . in section",
    "3 we find the solution of the corresponding equations and in this realize the manifold with the necessary properties . section  4 is devoted to consideration of concrete examples of integrable systems on the multidimensional manifold constructed above .",
    "comments and perspectives for further investigation are collected in section  5 .",
    "suppose we have a @xmath0 dimensional euclidian space with a set of independent coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we assume the existence of two mutually commutative generators of differentiation @xmath14 , @xmath15 , which satisfy the basic relations : d |y=0,|d y=0[leznov : eq-2 ] which are reminiscent of ( anti ) holomorphic functions in the theory of the complex variables .",
    "so @xmath14 is a linear combination of space derivatives with respect to the unbarred coordinates , @xmath15 is the same with respect to the barred ones : d=+u^ , |d=+v^ .[leznov : eq-3 ] we choose the coefficient functions of differentiation with respect to @xmath16 , @xmath17 to be equal to unity .",
    "this is an inessential restriction .",
    "if we demand mutual commutativity of these generators @xmath18=0 $ ] , then as a corollary of ( [ leznov : eq-3 ] ) we obtain the system of equations , which the coefficient functions must satisfy : dv^v^_y_n+u^ v^_y_=0,|du^=u^_|y_n+v^ u^_|y_=0 . [ leznov : eq-4 ] we will call ( [ leznov : eq-4 ] ) the @xmath19 system and the corresponding manifold the @xmath20 one .",
    "from ( [ leznov : eq-4 ] ) it follows that an arbitrary function @xmath21 of variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 are annihilated by differentiation by @xmath14 , all functions @xmath24 by @xmath15 . in this sense",
    "we will speak about holomorphic and antiholomrphic functions .",
    "the following proposition arises :    * proposition 1 .",
    "* _ each function @xmath21 annihilated by the operator @xmath14 is holomorphic ; a function  @xmath25 annihilated by the operator @xmath15 is antiholomorpthic . _",
    "let us add the equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 to the system of @xmath28 equations  ( [ leznov : eq-4 ] ) .",
    "then the @xmath29 sets of variables @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively satisfy a linear system of @xmath29 algebraic equations the matrix of which coincides with the jacobian matrix ( we consider the holomorphic case ) : j=_n |    cccc v^1 &  & v^n-1 & f + y_1 &  & y_n-1 & y_n     vanish . so proposition  1 is proved .    as a corollary we obtain the following    * proposition 2 .",
    "* |dv^=v^_|y_n+v^ v^_|y_= v^(v;|y),du^=u^_y_n+u^ u^_y_=u^(u;y ) .",
    "[ leznov : eq - ba ]    indeed operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 are commutative and so @xmath32 is solution of the same equation as @xmath22 satisfies . but",
    "each solution of third equation is a holomorphic function , which proves proposition  2 .",
    "if we consider functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 as given , then all operations of differentiation applied to the functions @xmath35 are well defined .    as was mentioned in the introduction",
    "only these operations arise in the theory of integrable systems constructed in the manner of ( [ leznov : eq-1 ] ) .",
    "thus for a realization of the proposed program it is necessary to solve the system of equations ( [ leznov : eq-4 ] ) , ( [ leznov : eq - ba ] ) with the given holomorphic and antiholomorphic @xmath33 , @xmath34 functions .",
    "consider the system of equations defining implicitly @xmath28 unknown functions @xmath38 in @xmath39 dimensional space @xmath40 : q^(;y)=p^(;|y)[leznov : eq - d ] with the convention that all greek indices take values between @xmath41 and @xmath28 .",
    "the number of equations in ( [ leznov : eq - d ] ) coincides with the number of unknown functions @xmath42 .",
    "each arbitrary function @xmath43 , @xmath44 depends on @xmath45 coordinates .    with the help of the usual rules of differentiation of implicit functions we find from ( [ leznov : eq - d ] ) : _",
    "y=(p_-q_)^-1 q_y,_|y=-(p_-q_)^ -1p_|y.[leznov : eq - dd ] let us assume , that between @xmath29 derivatives with respect to barred and unbarred variables the following linear dependence takes place : @xmath46 and analyse the corollaries following from these facts .",
    "assuming that @xmath47 , @xmath48 , dividing them into each equation of the left and right sets respectively and introducing the notation @xmath49 , @xmath50 , we rewrite the last system in the form : ^_y_n+^n-1_1 u^ ^_y_=0,^_|y_n+^n-1_1 v^ ^_|y_=0 . [ leznov : eq - ms ] substituting values of the derivatives from ( [ leznov : eq - dd ] ) and multiplying result by the matrix on the left we obtain : q^_y_n+^n-1_1 u^ q^_y_=0,p^_|y_n+^n-1_1 v^ p^_|y_=0 .",
    "[ leznov : eq - d1 ] from the last equations it immediately follow that : u=-(q_y)^-1 q_y_n , v=-(p_|y)^-1 p_|y_n .",
    "[ leznov : eq - uv ] we see that if we augment the initial system ( [ leznov : eq - d ] ) , by @xmath28 vector functions @xmath51 defined by ( [ leznov : eq - uv ] ) then the differential operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 defined by ( [ leznov : eq-3 ] ) in connection with ( [ leznov : eq - ms ] ) annihilate every @xmath52 and therefore the functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 : d = |d = d q = d p=|d q=|d p=0 . [ leznov : eq - vic ]",
    "this means that @xmath53 . and",
    "as a direct corollary of this fact @xmath54 and so the generators @xmath14 , @xmath15 constructed in this way are mutually commutative .",
    "thus we have found the general solution of the @xmath19 system and in such a way realise the manifold with the properties postulated in the previous section .",
    "it is possible to say ( the solution of the @xmath19 system is general ) that this realisation is unique up to possible similarity transformations .",
    "we present below the result of calculations of the functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 using the definition of @xmath55 , @xmath22 functions ( [ leznov : eq - uv ] ) : @xmath56",
    "below we would like to consider only two examples clarifying the situation .",
    "but really the same is true with respect to each two dimensional system integrable with the help of the formalism of graded algebras @xcite .",
    "we want to emphasize that in all cases ( particulary those considered below ) the @xmath20 manifold by itself is defined by @xmath57 arbitrary functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 each of one of which depends upon @xmath58 independent arguments .",
    "all these functions occur as coefficient functions ( via operators of differentiation @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) in equations of multidimensional integrable systems .",
    "naturally the general solution depends upon them .",
    "apart from these functions the general solution of an integrable system depends upon additional arbitrary functions the number of which and their functional dependence has to be sufficient for the statement of cauchy or gursat initial data problems .      by this term",
    "we understand the equation : @xmath59 by direct calculation one can become convinced that its general solution has the form : @xmath60 for instance in the four - dimensional case @xmath61 : @xmath62 and @xmath63 the functions @xmath64 , @xmath65 are arbitrary holomrphic , antiholomorphic functions .",
    "the equations of the toda lattice in two dimensions have the form ( one of the many possible ones ) : @xmath66 the general solution may be represented as : @xmath67 where matrix elements of the determinant matrix @xmath68 are as follows : @xmath69 and the single function @xmath68 has the form : @xmath70",
    "@xmath71 is the determinant of the wronskian matrix with elements : @xmath72    to obtain the explicit general solution of multidimensional toda lattice system : @xmath73 only the following changes in all the corresponding formulae above are necessary : @xmath74 and consider arbitrary functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 as arbitrary holomorphic , antiholomorphic functions on the manifold @xmath20 of the corresponding dimension .",
    "the main results of the present paper are in the general solution of the @xmath19 system ( [ leznov : eq-4 ] ) , a realisation of a multidimensional manifold with two commutative operators of differentiation ( section  3 ) and the integrable systems in the spaces of arbitrary dimensions constructed in this framework ( section  4 ) .",
    "it turns out that with the help of @xmath20 manifold it is possible to find general solution of such interesting from the point of viw physical applications systems as homogeneous complex monge  amphr and bateman equations in the spaces of arbitrary dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by reducing of the definite kind the general solution of @xmath19 system on subclasses in which solution of it is functionally depends only on two arbitrary functions of the necessary number of independent arguments .",
    "it is obviousl that formalism of evolution type systems ( integrable with the help of the old inverse scattering method ) remains without any changings in the spaces of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the exactly integrable systems considered above are the symmetries of evolution type equations .",
    "the knowledge of the general solution of the first allow represent in explicit form multisoliton solutions of the last .",
    "if the manifold constructed would have any relation to the real four dimensional world , then something similar to einstein s general relativity would occur .",
    "indeed , in both cases the general ( geometrical ) properties of the world be determined by some fundamental physical objects , the metrical tensor @xmath77 in the case of general relativity , einstein s equations for which takes into account the presence of all forms of matter and the equations @xmath19 describing the manifold @xmath20 in the case considered above ( which of course must be modified to take into account all other physical fields ) . to be optimistic , it may happen that equations of general relativity have a solution on the manifold of the kind described above or something similar to it .",
    "of course all this is only an attractive speculation and only a deeper investigation of the problem may clarify the situation .",
