    "relativistic heavy ion collisions aim to create the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and study its properties at the extreme conditions of high temperature and energy density  @xcite . the collective flow as a soft probe is often used to study the qgp properties in experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "both hydrodynamics  @xciteand transport theory  @xcitecan describe the bulk data in heavy ion collisions .",
    "for example , the string melting version of a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite reasonably reproduces particle yields , @xmath1 spectra , and @xmath2 of low-@xmath1 pions and kaons in central and mid - central au+au collisions at 200a gev and pb+pb collisions at 2760a gev  @xcite .",
    "the small system data can be also satisfactorily described by ampt  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that light parton @xmath0 is mainly generated by the anisotropic parton escape from the collision zone and hydrodynamics may play only a minor role  @xcite .",
    "it suggests that the mass ordering of @xmath0 , commonly believed as a signature of hydrodynamics , may arise from other mechanisms . in these proceedings ,",
    "we first investigate the physic mechanisms of mass ordering in ampt  @xcite .",
    "we then study the production mechanism of the charm @xmath0 in light of the escape mechanism for the light quark @xmath0 .",
    "we employ the string melting version of ampt  @xcite in our study .",
    "the model consists of four components : fluctuating initial conditions , parton elastic scatterings , quark coalescence for hadronization , and hadronic interactions .",
    "the partons interaction are modeled by zhang s parton cascade ( zpc )  @xcite .",
    "we use debye screened differential cross - section @xmath3  @xcite , with strong coupling constant @xmath4 and debye screening mass @xmath5/fm ( the total cross section is then @xmath6  mb ) for all ampt simulation in our work .",
    "after partons stop interaction , a simple quark coalescence model is applied to combine two nearest partons into a meson and three nearest partons into a baryon(or antibaryon ) .",
    "the hadronic interactions are described by the art model  @xcite .",
    "we terminate the hadronic interactions at a cutoff time .",
    "we simulate three collision systems : au+au collisions with @xmath7 - 8.1  fm at the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energy @xmath8  gev , @xmath9+au collisions with @xmath10  fm at @xmath8  gev , and @xmath11+pb collisions with @xmath10  fm at @xmath12  tev by ampt .",
    "we analyze the momentum - space azimuthal anisotropy of partons in the final state before hadronization , of hadrons right after hadronization before hadronic rescatterings take place , and of freeze - out hadrons in the final state .",
    "the momentum anisotropy is characterized by fourier coefficients  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the azimuthal angle of the particle ( parton or hadron ) momentum .",
    "the @xmath15 is the harmonic plane of each event from its initial configuration of all partons .",

    "[ fig : fig3_s ] ]    considering that observed pions and protons are made of only light constituent quarks , the difference between their @xmath2 should come from the hadronization process and/or hadronic rescattering .",
    "we first study the primordial hadrons right after hadronization , before any decay and hadronic rescatterings take place .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1](a ) shows the @xmath2 of primordial charged pion , kaon , and ( anti)proton as a function of @xmath1 ( solid curves ) .",
    "it demonstrates that the mass ordering of @xmath0 at low @xmath1 in ampt comes from the dynamic in coalescence .",
    "the dynamical `` selections '' of constituent quarks into pions , kaons , and protons are manifest in the constituent quark @xmath2 distributions shown by the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , plotted at the respective _ hadron _ @xmath1 .    figure  [ fig : fig1](b ) shows the @xmath2 results by @xmath14-randomized ampt  @xcite for primordial hadrons right after coalescence hadronization at the corresponding constituent quark @xmath2 s .",
    "no hydrodynamic anisotropic flow is present in the @xmath14-randomized case  @xcite , however , mass splitting is still present .",
    "it implies that the mass splitting is mainly due to kinematics in the coalescence process .",
    "it is therefore not a unique signature of collective anisotropic flow or hydrodynamics .",
    "after hadronization , particles undergo decay and rescattering .",
    "we evaluate the @xmath2 of hadrons before hadronic rescattering but including effects of resonance decays by setting the cut - off time to be 0.6 fm / c .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) by the dashed curves .",
    "the decay product @xmath2 is usually smaller than their parent @xmath2  @xcite . by including decay products ,",
    "the hadron @xmath2 is reduced from that of primordial hadrons ( solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the @xmath2 values before hadronic rescattering ( including resonance decay effects ) can be considered as the initial @xmath2 for the hadronic evolution stage .",
    "the final - stage freezeout hadron @xmath2 s ( also including decay daughters ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) by the solid curves .",
    "pion @xmath2 increases while proton @xmath2 decreases from before to after hadronic rescattering .",
    "this may be due to interactions between pions and protons , after which they tend to flow together at the same velocity .",
    "thus , the same - velocity pions and protons ( i.e.  small @xmath1 pions and large @xmath1 protons ) will tend to have the same anisotropy .",
    "it will yield lower @xmath2 for the protons and higher @xmath2 for the pions at the same @xmath1 value .",
    "this should happen whether or not there is a net gain in the overall charged hadron @xmath2 , which depends on the initial configuration geometry from which the hadronic evolution begins  @xcite .",
    "the similar results in @xmath9+au  collisions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b )  @xcite .    to summarize the origin of @xmath2 mass splitting , we plot the @xmath2 of pions , kaons , and protons within @xmath20  gev/@xmath21 , a typical region for different stages of the collision system evolution as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3_s ] .",
    "the evolution stages contain : ( i ) right after coalescence hadronization including only primordial hadrons ( labeled `` prim . '' ) ; ( ii ) right after coalescence hadronization but including decay products ( labeled `` w/ decay '' ) ; and ( iii ) at final freezeout ( labeled  w/ rescatt .",
    "w/ decay ) .",
    "we can see the mass ordering actually comes from interplay of several physics effects ; it comes from coalescence , and more importantly , from hadronic rescattering process .",
    "in this section we discuss the production mechanism of charm quark flow in ppb .",
    "we compare the light and charm quark freeze out @xmath2 , integrated over all @xmath1 at the same proper time .",
    "this is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4_c ] .",
    "the charm @xmath0 is systematically lower than light quark @xmath0 .",
    "this may suggest that the charm quark is not as thermalized as light quarks .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4_c ] shows @xmath14-randomized results .",
    "the charm and light quark @xmath2 are similar suggesting a common escape mechanism .",
    "in these proceedings , we investigate the origin of mass splitting of identified hadron @xmath0 .",
    "the mass splitting is due to coalescence and , more importantly , hadronic rescattering .",
    "it is therefore not a unique signature of hydrodynamics .",
    "we also study the development of charm @xmath0 and found the escape mechanism to be the major contribution in ppb similar to light quarks .",
