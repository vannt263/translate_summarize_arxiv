    "ic2391 is one of the youngest and nearest open clusters .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ distance modulus for the cluster is ( m - m)@xmath2@xmath35.82 . as a compromise between various determinations of the distance modulus and _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( becker & fenkart 1971 ; lyng 1987 ; van leeuwen 1999 ; robichon et al .",
    "1999 ) , we adopt ( m - m)@xmath4=5.95@xmath50.1 , corresponding to a distance of 155 pc .",
    "the mean reddening towards the cluster is small , e(b - v)=0.06 ( patten & simon 1996 ) .",
    "prior to our lithium depletion age determination , the most commonly quoted age estimate for ic2391 was @xmath335 myr ( mermilliod 1981 ) .",
    "in barrado y navascus , stauffer & patten ( 1999 ) we derived a new age estimate of @xmath6 myr .",
    "because of its proximity and youth , ic2391 has been the target of a number of recent studies",
    ". rotational velocities , lithium abundances and h@xmath7 data for g , k and early m dwarf members can be found in stauffer et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1997 ) .",
    "x - ray fluxes , rotational periods and low resolution spectra for another set of probable cluster members are provided by patten & simon ( 1986 ) and simon & patten ( 1998 ) .",
    "all these data support the conclusion that ic2391 is younger than the alpha per cluster ( @xmath385 myr in the new lithium age scale , stauffer et al .",
    "1999 ; barrado y navascus , stauffer , & bouvier 1999 ; stauffer & barrado y navascus 2000 ) but significantly older than 10 myr ( e.g. , because the cluster contains no classical ttauri stars ) .    for an age of 35 myr , we expected the lithium depletion boundary for ic2391 to be at i@xmath8@xmath915.2 ( baraffe 1998 , private communication ; stauffer , schultz , & kirkpatrick 1998 ) .",
    "the rosat images of the cluster only supplied candidate cluster members down to i@xmath8@xmath315 .",
    "no appropriate deep photographic plate sequences are available for a proper motion survey to the desired depth .",
    "we therefore obtained deep , multicolor photometric imaging of the cluster in order to produce a list of candidate cluster members . because of the low galactic latitude of the cluster ( _ b_@xmath10=-6.90 )",
    ", our derived candidate list may be significantly contaminated by field stars .",
    "we therefore defer extensive discussion of these candidates until detailed spectroscopic follow - up is available .    in section 2 , we provide the details of our imaging program .",
    "the method we used to identify candidate cluster members is outlined in section 3 .",
    "our optical ccd photometric data ( v , r@xmath8,i@xmath8,z ) were collected at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory during four different observing runs : january 22 , 1998 , at the 0.9 m ( ri@xmath8 filters ) ; january 2425 , 1998 , at the blanco 4 m telescope ( ri@xmath8 filters ) ; april 4 , 1998 , at the 1.5 m ( ri@xmath8 filters ) ; and january 46 , 1999 , again with the 0.9 m telescope ( vi@xmath8z filters ) . in the case of the ctio 0.9",
    "m runs , we used the tek 2048 # 3 camera ( 0.43 arcsec / pix ) , yielding a field of view @xmath314 arcmin on a side . for the ctio 1.5 m telescope",
    ", we used the ccd site @xmath11 imager at the f/7.5 focus , yielding an image scale of 0.44\" / pix and a field of view of @xmath12 arcmin . for the blanco telescope campaign , we used the big throughput camera ( btc ) , a mosaic detector composed of four different 2048@xmath13 pixel ccds .",
    "each ccd covers an area of 14.7@xmath1414.7 arcmin , and the mosaic has a cross - shaped gap , 5.4 arcmin wide , between the ccds . the total projected area on the sky of the btc mosaic is roughly 0.25 sq .",
    "deg . , with a scale of 0.43 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the january 1998 and april 1998 runs were used to make sure we would be able to calibrate the btc observations and to cover the gaps between the ccds of the btc mosaic . in total , we have covered an area close to 2.5 sq .",
    "( 2 sq . deg . with the btc ) .",
    "table 1 lists the coordinates of the center of each field , as well as the exposure times .",
    "figure 1 shows the location of the observed area , together with our very low mass ( vlm ) stars and brown dwarf ( bd ) candidates ( cross symbols ) .",
    "the ccd images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using standard data reduction techniques and tools within iraf .",
    "the apphot package was used to extract instrumental magnitudes for the objects of interest in each ccd field .",
    "all our 0.9 m and 1.5 m data were obtained under photometric conditions .",
    "unfortunately , this was not the case for the ctio 4 m run ( btc data ) .",
    "therefore , we used the first two sets of data from the 0.9 m and 1.5 m telescopes to calibrate the btc data , corresponding to the ( ri)@xmath8 filters .",
    "this calibration included several steps .",
    "first , we extracted the instrumental magnitudes for all the ccds using small apertures ( @xmath32 pixels , equivalent to @xmath30.9 arcsec ) .",
    "then , for each image , we derived an aperture correction ( @xmath30.12 mag ) . using this method",
    ", we minimized the photometric errors , since we did not include flux from the nearby sky .",
    "then , for the 0.9 m and 1.5 m data , we corrected for the airmass .",
    "we assumed the standard ctio extinction coefficient ( 0.08 mag / airmass and 0.06 mag / airmass for the r@xmath8 and i@xmath8 filters , respectively ) .",
    "standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) were observed in all cases , including the fields sa98 , sa104 , pg1047 and pg1323 . they were used to calibrate the data into the cousins system . finally , the calibrated photometry from the 0.9 m and 1.5 m runs was compared with the instrumental magnitudes of the btc campaign .",
    "this provided a zero point shift for each filter from which we computed calibrated magnitudes for the btc survey .",
    "we did not find any significant color term between the three cameras / filter systems .",
    "table 1 lists the limiting magnitudes for each field in the r@xmath8 and i@xmath8 filters .",
    "the internal errors should be better than 0.15 magnitudes at the limiting magnitudes ; and the photon statistical errors are @xmath30.01 mag for r@xmath8@xmath317 and i@xmath8@xmath316 for the 0.9 m and 1.5 m data , and 0.01 for r@xmath8@xmath319 and i@xmath8@xmath317.5 for the btc data .",
    "we have estimated the completeness limits from the histogram log n@xmath15 versus magnitude .",
    "these limits are defined by the magnitude where the histogram deviates from a straight line ( see wainscoat et al . 1992 and santiago et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the case of the 0.9 m and 1.5 m data ,",
    "they are r@xmath8@xmath318.5 and i@xmath8@xmath318.0 mag . for the btc data ,",
    "we have reached r@xmath8@xmath320.5 and i@xmath8@xmath320 mag .    in order to check the external accuracy of our optical data ,",
    "we have carried out different comparisons . as stated before , we calibrated the btc data using 2 different campaigns ( 0.9 m and 1.5 m telescopes ) which took place immediately before and after that run .",
    "the comparison between these two runs gives dispersions of @xmath16(r)=0.08 , @xmath16(i)=0.07 and @xmath16(r - i)@xmath8=0.01 .",
    "the calibration of the btc photometry has dispersions of 0.03 and 0.04 magnitudes for the r@xmath8 and i@xmath8 filters , respectively ( rms scatter of the difference between the raw and calibrated magnitudes of the standard stars ) .",
    "finally , the optical photometry for overlapping fields of the btc survey agrees within 0.06 and 0.04 magnitudes ( one sigma ) for the r@xmath8 and i@xmath8 filters , after the calibration .    for the last observing run ( january 1999 , ctio 0.9 m )",
    ", we used the vi@xmath8z filters and the photometry was calibrated independently .",
    "the v - band instrumental magnitudes were corrected for the effects of atmospheric extinction and were placed on the standard system ( johnson - kron - cousins ) using observations of photometric standard stars ( landolt 1992 ) and previously determined ( r - i)@xmath8 colors for our program objects . because the i@xmath8 and z ccd images were taken in consecutive pairs ( i.e. , at the same airmass ) and",
    "because at that time there were no well - established standard stars for z filter photometry in the literature , we did not perform an absolute calibration of the i@xmath8 and z data . instead , an ( i - z)@xmath17 color index was calculated using just the @xmath18 and @xmath19 instrumental magnitudes . as in zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we set i@xmath8=z for those standard stars observed with ( r - i)@xmath30 in order to determine a zero - point correction for our ( i - z)@xmath17 color index .",
    "the internal errors of our v - band photometry are estimated to range from @xmath30.02 mag for v@xmath317 to @xmath30.15 mag for v@xmath321 .",
    "the external errors on the v magnitudes may be larger since our typical program stars are much redder than any of the standard stars used to determine the transformation to the standard system .",
    "the uncertainties in the ( i - z)@xmath17 color are estimated from the errors in the i@xmath8 and z magnitudes as supplied by the phot routine in iraf .",
    "they are computed as @xmath20(z - i)@xmath13=@xmath20z@xmath13@xmath21@xmath20i@xmath13 .",
    "these should be on the order of 0.02 mag or less for the majority of the objects in our ic 2391 sample ( for i@xmath8@xmath317 mag ) .",
    "the infrared data were obtained by the 2mass survey ( skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) at the ctio facility during november 21 - 25 and november 28 - 29 , 1998 and processed at ipac in january , 1999 .",
    "all 2mass scans used for this analysis were observed under photometric conditions . based on photometric error and",
    "total sources detected with magnitude we estimate that these 2mass data still reach @xmath22 completeness and snr @xmath23 at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 despite any possible confusion noise in this field .",
    "both our optical data and the 2mass survey have very accurate coordinates ( see next subsection ) .",
    "therefore , using the optical coordinates as input , we searched in the 2mass catalog for a ir counterpart , using a 3 arcsec radii for this search , much larger than the errors in the coordinates .      to define astrometric solutions for the ccd frames we used secondary astrometric standards derived from united kingdom schmidt photographic plate material measured using the precision microdensitometer supercosmos ( eg .",
    "hambly et al .",
    "the global astrometric solution for the schmidt plate was derived using the tycho ",
    "act reference catalog ( urban , corbin & wycoff 1998 ) , and includes correction for non - linear systematic effects caused by the mechanical deformation of the plates during exposure ( eg .",
    "irwin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we used the `` short red '' survey plate r6843 ( epoch 1981.3 , field number 165 ) for ic2391 .",
    "these exposures , taken at low galactic latitudes , are far less crowded than the sky limited survey plates and reach r@xmath320 ( as opposed to r@xmath27 for the deep survey plates ) .",
    "they are ideal for accurate astrometry of secondary standards as faint as r=20 which overlaps with unsaturated objects on the ccd frames .",
    "the rms residual per act star in the global astrometric plate solution was @xmath28 arcsec in both coordinates ; we estimate that there will be no systematic errors in the ccd astrometric solutions larger than this value .",
    "the positions of our ic2391 candidates are listed in table 2 .",
    "the initial selection of candidate members of ic2391 was carried out using the location of the detected stars on the i@xmath8 versus ( r - i)@xmath8 color - magnitude diagram .",
    "figure 2 displays the data obtained at the 4 m ctio / btc telescope , where detections are shown as dots . an empirical zero age main sequence ( zams ) , based on data from leggett ( 1992 ) , is included as a solid line .",
    "the zams is plotted for our assumed ic2391 distance modulus and a reddening of e(r - i)=0.007 [ david : is this e(r - i ) compatible with the e(b - v ) mentioned earlier in the text ? ]",
    "completeness and limiting magnitudes are depicted as dashed lines .",
    "we selected all the detected objects in a wide band well above the zams .",
    "the lower envelope for the strip follows a 50 myr isochrone ( dantona & mazzitelli 1997 ) and the upper envelope is displaced 0.75 mag brighter to include equal mass binaries .",
    "the boundaries of the strip were also adjusted to take into account the photometric errors and errors in the distance , age and the reddening . hence , this band is wider than the 0.75 mag . then , all candidates were visually inspected on the original images , in order to avoid the presence of false detections , and to verify the stellar - like shape of the detections and the lack of nearby bright stars or cosmic rays which could modify the photometry of the candidate . since there is no clear separation between the field stars and the location of the cluster isochrone , we expect a strong contamination by spurious members .",
    "specifically , those candidates located only slightly above the zams should be considered with some caution , since they are well below the 50 myr isochrone . in total , we have selected 206 candidate members , 94 from the btc survey and another 112 from the 0.9 m and 1.5 m data .",
    "figure 3 shows all our candidate members as circles .",
    "solid circles indicate the position of the candidates whose membership has been confirmed spectroscopically , via radial velocity , spectral type and several spectroscopic features ( h@xmath7 , nai8200 ) .",
    "these results are discussed in barrado y navascus , stauffer , & patten ( 1999 ) , where we provide a lithium depletion boundary ( see barrado y navascus , stauffer & bouvier 1999 ) age for the cluster ( 53@xmath55 myr ) .",
    "figure 3 also displays the position of a 50 myr isochrone ( short - dashed line ) , adapted from dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) .",
    "based on our spectroscopically confirmed members and on simon & patten ( 1996 ) data , we have created an empirical ic2391 isochrone , shown as a long - dashed line .",
    "table 2 lists the positions , optical and infrared photometry , the separation between the optical detection and the ir source and the identification with stars from the literature , for each candidate .",
    "the merger of our ri@xmath8 data with the 2mass photometry , and the additional vi@xmath8z photometry collected in january 1999 , allows us to create a large database of optical - infrared broadband photometry in 7 different filters .",
    "therefore , we have been able to construct several color - magnitude and color - color diagrams .",
    "we have used these diagrams to estimate the membership status of each candidate .",
    "figure 4a depicts the [ v,(v - i@xmath8 ) ] diagram .",
    "the empirical main sequence ( ms ) for young disk stars by leggett ( 1992 ) is included as a solid line .",
    "this ms was built for m0-m9 dwarfs , in the ranges 6.65 @xmath9 m(i@xmath8 ) @xmath9 14.67 , 4.77 @xmath9 m(k@xmath29 ) @xmath9 10.17 , 0.75 @xmath9 ( r - i)@xmath8 @xmath9 2.30 , and 0.17 @xmath9 ( h - k ) @xmath9 0.48 .",
    "note that our 2mass data were taken in k@xmath0 . however , there are no important differences between the k@xmath0 and k@xmath29systems ( see persson et al 1998 ) . for comparison purposes , the shift of the photometry corresponding to an interstellar absorption of a@xmath30=2",
    "is plotted as an arrow . proposed",

    "figure 4b displays the i@xmath8 magnitudes against the ( i@xmath8-k@xmath0 ) color , whereas figure 4c shows the k@xmath0 magnitudes against the ( j - k@xmath0 ) . in all these figures ,",
    "solid triangles represent initial candidate members whose membership has been rejected based on figures 4 and 5 ( probable non - members ) , whereas open triangles show the possible non  members .",
    "possible and probable members are represented by open and solid circles , respectively ( see next subsection ) .",

    "panel a and b depict [ ( v - r@xmath8),(r - i)@xmath8 ] , and [ ( i@xmath8-k@xmath0),(r - i)@xmath8 ] , respectively .",
    "it is clear from examination of these diagrams that our original sample included both stars that are plausible cluster members and objects that are instead very likely to be heavily reddened , background stars .      in order to remove the spurious members present in our candidate member list",
    ", we have used several color - color diagrams and color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "this selection was carried out in a hierarchical way , stressing the spectroscopic and ir data .",
    "the scheme we followed is described below :    1 .",
    "a fraction of our candidates has intermediate resolution spectroscopy ( barrado y navascus et al .",
    "1999 ) , which indicates whether they are probable members or non - members .",
    "we have removed the objects having a large interstellar reddening ( see figure 4b , c and figure 5b ) .",
    "they were classified as probable non - members .",
    "3 .   color - color diagrams were used to remove additional probable non - members ( figures 5a , b ) .",
    "objects fainter than i@xmath8=17 mag , and without ir data ( they are too faint to be detected by the 2mass survey ) were classified as possible members , whereas stars brighter than this value , with no ir data ( they should have been detected by 2mass ) are listed as possible non - members .",
    "objects bluer than the leggett s ( 1992 ) ir main - sequence appear in table 2 as possible members .",
    "objects bluer than our empirical optical isochrone or at the upper ( bright ) edge of our cm diagram selection strip were also classified as possible members .",
    "finally , the objects that remain are considered to be bona fide members of the cluster (  probable members \" ) .    as a summary",
    ", we have classified our initial ic2391 candidate members in four different categories :    * probable members .",
    "objects located in all cm and cc diagrams with positions which indicate membership .",
    "they are identified with the flag `` _ mem _ '' in the last column of table 2 ( 50 objects , including 16 having spectroscopy ) . * possible members ( 82 objects ) .",
    "they appear identified with the flag `` _ mem _ ? '' in table 2 . * possible non - members ( 10 ) .",
    "( `` _ nm ?",
    "_ '' flag ) .",
    "* probable non - members ( 64 ) .",
    "all of them are flagged with `` _ nm _ '' in table 2 .",
    "if we only consider our probable members , we have detected objects @xmath32 magnitudes fainter than the previous surveys ( rolleston & byrne 1997 ; simon & patten 1998 ; patten & pavlovsky 1999 ) .",
    "our faintest possible ic2391 member has i@xmath8=20.9 , which is 5 magnitudes fainter than the least massive candidate discovered to date . in total",
    ", we list 132 objects as probable or possible members of ic2391 .    we have not computed the luminosity function ( lf ) and mass function ( mf ) . due to",
    "its low galactic latitude of the cluster ( _ b_@xmath10=-6.90 ) , even when using the probable / possible member list , pollution by spurious members is likely to be significant",
    ". visual inspection of the i,(r - i)@xmath8 color - magnitude diagram ( figure 3 ) reveals two important characteristics : the relative high number of candidate members with i@xmath8 in the range 19.520.9 , and the apparent gap just before this clustering occurs .",
    "only additional photometry or spectroscopy would allow us to establish if these faint candidates are real .",
    "however , we expect a strong contamination by field stars in this range",
    ". if most of these objects are , indeed , not members , the gap would be illusory and the low number of candidate members below i@xmath8=18 could be a consequence of our completeness limit ( dotted line in figure 3 ) .",
    "the question is still open , until a follow - up spectroscopic study is carried out .      in a deep optical survey of the pleiades , bouvier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated that the contamination due to field stars was 25% .",
    "this value has been confirmed by subsequent spectroscopic follow - up of the pleiades candidates .",
    "since ic2391 is closer to the galactic plane than the pleiades ( _ b_@xmath10=-6.90 and _ b_@xmath10=-23.52 , respectively ) , the contamination should be much stronger .",
    "in fact , figure 2 of bouvier et al . (",
    "1998 ) shows a clear discontinuity between field stars and the pleiades population .",
    "this is not the case for ic2391 , whose color - magnitude digram ( figure 3 ) depicts a smooth transition between the field and the locus of the main sequence of the cluster , indicating that contamination by spurious members should be stronger than in the case of the pleiades . to estimate the degree of contamination by field stars , we have constructed histograms of the number of stars per magnitude bin at various ( r - i)@xmath8 color intervals . in figure 6",
    "we show the histogram for the ( r - i)@xmath8=1.9 - 2.0 range , representative of the distribution of stars down to approximately the completeness limit of the btc data . the locus of the cluster is indicated .",
    "similar diagrams for adjoining color ranges provide analogous results .",
    "the last bin before the cluster contains 3 stars , whereas the brightest bin , well above the main sequence for equal mass binary cluster stars ( 0.75 brighter than the single star ms ) , has 5 stars .",
    "the bins in between have 17 stars .",
    "assuming an average contamination of 4 stars per bin , the pollution rate would be @xmath350% for the initial list of ic2391 candidates ( the ri@xmath8 survey ) .",
    "our optical and infrared color - color and color - magnitude diagrams have allowed us to remove about 33% of the candidates from the initial 206 objects .",
    "therefore , we estimate that objects cataloged as members in table 2 ( probable and possible members ) still have a @xmath325% or greater probability of being spurious",
    ".    the faintest objects , lacking vzjhk data , may be more strongly polluted by field stars .",
    "based on the position of the lithium depletion boundary in members of ic2391 , barrado y navascus , stauffer , & patten ( 1999 ) have recently determined an age for the cluster of 53@xmath55 myr . for this age",
    ", the border between the stellar and substellar regimes would be at m(i@xmath8)=11.06 ( baraffe 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "taking into account the ic2391 distance and reddening , this leads to i@xmath8=17.03 .",
    "therefore , all our ic2391 candidates fainter than that value should be brown dwarfs if they indeed belong to the cluster .",
    "our list of final candidates contains ten objects which have been cataloged as probable and possible members based on both optical and infrared data and which have i@xmath8 in the range 17.0617.62 . using the baraffe ( 2000 ) models ,",
    "their mass range is 0.0700.055 m@xmath1 .",
    "actually , two of these objects ( ctio-061 and ctio-113 ) have been observed using low s / n , intermediate resolution spectroscopy ( barrado y navascus , stauffer , & patten 1999 ) .",
    "several spectral characteristics , such as h@xmath7 and nai8200 equivalent widths , spectral type , rough radial velocities , indicate that they are real members of the cluster and , therefore , brown dwarfs .",
    "another 50 objects in table 2 are fainter than than the i@xmath8 magnitude of the stellar / substellar limit and lack infrared data .",
    "all of them are listed as possible members in table 2 , with magnitudes down to i@xmath8=20.9 , m(i@xmath8)=14.93 , and m @xmath32 0.025 m@xmath33 .",
    "a comparison between our final candidate members ( circles ) and previous surveys ( triangles ) of ic2391 is shown in figure 7a .",
    "probable candidate members are displayed with solid circles , whereas open circles represent objects which do not have infrared counterparts ( normally , because they are too faint to be detected by 2mass ) .",
    "the stars from simon & patten ( 1996 ) are shown as solid triangle , and the objects from patten & pavlovsky ( 1999 ) appear as open triangles . clearly , all these samples merge smoothly , describing a good cluster isochrone .",
    "most of our probable candidate members are above the empirical isochrone , which was obtained based on confirmed members of the cluster ( figure 3 ) .",
    "in fact , they are located in a wide band , slightly larger than @xmath30.75 mag ( the maximum shift due to binarity ) .",
    "we have compared our optical data of ic2391 candidates with data from two other very well known clusters .",
    "figure 7b contains photometry from the pleiades ( asterisks ) , alpha per ( plus symbols ) and ic2391 ( solid and open circles for probable and possible members ) .",
    "these open clusters have lithium ages of 125 , 85 and 53 myr , respectively ( stauffer , schultz , & kirkpatrick 1998 ; stauffer et al .",
    "1999 ; barrado y navascus , stauffer , & patten 1999 ) .",
    "the large width of the ic2391 main sequence , which includes probable and possible members , can be appreciated . however , this scatter is greatly reduced if we only take into account probable members . then , the scatter is similar to the value present in the other two clusters .",
    "this is consistent with our previous estimate of the contamination for the possible members which are located at the blue side of our empirical ic2391 isochrone . only further spectroscopy ( or , eventually , proper motions ) will allow us to verify the membership status of these objects .",
    "the comparison between the ms lower envelopes of these two clusters with the lower ms of ic2391 probable members suggests that , indeed , ic2391 is slightly younger than alpha per , and that both of them are considerably younger than the pleiades .",
    "using optical and infrared data , and based on the location on cm and cc diagrams , we have identified a large sample of very low mass stars and brown dwarf candidates of the young cluster ic2391 .",
    "accurate coordinates , derived from the supercosmos microdensitometer , are provided for all of them .",
    "we have established a total of 50 probable cluster members , based on their position in the cluster loci in all cc and cm diagrams .",
    "another 82 objects have been cataloged by us as possible members .",
    "we have identified two candidate sub - stellar ic2391 members for which we have a full set of multicolor photometry , and whose location in all the cm and cc diagrams supports cluster membership .",
    "we have an additional 50 candidate substellar mass members in ic2391 , but because we have less or poorer data for these objects we expect that many of them will instead be low mass field stars .",
