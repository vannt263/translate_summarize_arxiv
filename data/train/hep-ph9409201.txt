    "one of the unexplained features of the standard model of the strong and electroweak interactions is why some fermions , the quarks , experience the strong interaction while others , the leptons , do not .",
    "experience has taught us to look for symmetry even when it is not apparent , and this leads one to speculate that , at some deeper level , quarks and leptons are identical .",
    "perhaps there exists a symmetry between quarks and leptons which is broken at high energy , in much the same way that the electroweak symmetry is broken at an energy scale of @xmath4 250 gev .",
    "if we further speculate that the quark - lepton symmetry is a local gauge symmetry , we are led to predict a new force of nature which mediates transitions between leptons and quarks . the simplest model which incorporates this idea is the pati - salam model @xcite , based on the group @xmath5 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath6 is the ordinary strong interaction , and lepton number is the fourth `` color '' . at some high energy scale , the group @xmath5 is spontaneously broken to @xmath6 , liberating the leptons from the influence of the strong interaction and breaking the symmetry between quarks and leptons .    in this paper",
    "we explore signals for quark - lepton unification  la pati - salam .",
    "we show that rare @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 decays are the most sensitive probes of the presence of quark - lepton transitions mediated by heavy pati - salam bosons .",
    "a new feature of our analysis is that we do not restrict ourselves to the assumption that the @xmath0 lepton is associated with the third generation of quarks , but also consider the possibility that it is associated with the second , or even first , generation .",
    "a recent paper on pati - salam bosons also considers this possibility @xcite .",
    "our analyses overlap for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and agree .",
    "we further show that @xmath9 and rare @xmath3 decays are the most sensitive probes in the scenario in which the @xmath0 lepton is associated with the first generation of quarks .",
    "pati - salam bosons are members of a class of bosons called `` leptoquarks '' , since they mediate transitions between leptons and quarks .",
    "they are spin one , and have non - chiral couplings to quarks and leptons .",
    "there are several recent model - independent analyses of bounds on leptoquarks .",
    "@xcite concentrates on spin - zero leptoquarks with chiral couplings , and ref .",
    "@xcite on spin - one leptoquarks with chiral couplings .",
    "@xcite considers both spin - zero and spin - one leptoquarks , with chiral and non - chiral couplings , and with the leptons associated with the quark generations in all six permutations .    in section 2 we review the pati - salam model . in sections 3 , 4 , and 5",
    "we discuss rare decays mediated by pati - salam bosons in the scenarios where the @xmath0 lepton is associated with the third , second , and first generations , respectively .",
    "the bounds on the pati - salam - boson mass from rare @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 decays are summarized in table 1 .",
    "section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "pati and salam proposed a class of unified models which incorporate quark - lepton unification @xcite.@xmath10 a common feature of these models is the group @xmath5 , with the subgroup @xmath6 corresponding to the strong interaction , and with lepton number identified as the fourth `` color '' . in this section",
    "we discuss the minimal model which embodies quark - lepton unification via the @xmath5 pati - salam group .",
    "because quarks and leptons with the same @xmath11 quantum number have different hypercharge , the pati - salam group @xmath5 can not commute with hypercharge . furthermore , although @xmath5 can break to @xmath12 , this @xmath13 is not hypercharge , but rather the difference of baryon number and lepton number ; we henceforth refer to it as @xmath14 , as is standard .",
    "another group is needed to replace hypercharge .",
    "the simplest possibility is to introduce another @xmath13 group , called @xmath15 ( notation to be explained shortly ) , such that @xmath16 breaks spontaneously to @xmath17 .",
    "the particle content of the @xmath18 model is @xmath19 where the subscripts on the quarks denote color ( red , green , blue ) , and the subscripts @xmath20 denote chirality .",
    "the model is free of gauge and mixed gravitational anomalies .",
    "the @xmath15 quantum numbers of the @xmath11 singlet fields , @xmath21 , suggest that @xmath15 is a subgroup of an @xmath22 group ; hence the notation .",
    "we will not make this additional assumption , since it does not affect our analysis .",
    "however , we remark that @xmath23 is a maximal subgroup of @xmath24 , so another motivation for considering @xmath25 is @xmath24 grand unification @xcite",
    ". however , the @xmath25 breaking scale in this model is very high , at least @xmath26 gev , well out of reach of low - energy experiments @xcite .",
    "another motivation for considering the pati - salam group is provided by extended technicolor models .",
    "one can show that these models must incorporate gauged quark - lepton unification , or massless neutral goldstone bosons ( axions ) and light ( @xmath27 5 gev ) charged pseudo - goldstone bosons will result from electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . the simplest way to achieve",
    "this , often employed in model building @xcite , is to introduce a pati - salam group .",
    "one canonically associates the @xmath0 lepton with the third generation of quarks , both for reasons of mass ( they are the heaviest known fermions of their respective classes ) , and for historical reasons ( the @xmath0 lepton and the @xmath28 quark were the last fundamental fermions discovered ; evidence for the top quark has recently been presented @xcite ) .",
    "this is certainly a natural assumption .",
    "however , the flavor - symmetry - breaking mechanism , which is responsible for fermion mass generation , is a mystery .",
    "one should keep an open mind to the possibility that the @xmath0 lepton is actually associated with the second or first generation of quarks .",
    "generically , one would expect that there is a mixing matrix , analogous to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which describes the mixing of the lepton generations with the quark generations .",
    "we will make the assumption that this matrix is nearly diagonal , as is the ckm matrix , but consider the scenarios where the @xmath0 lepton is most closely associated with the third , second or first generations in the following sections .",
    "because the pati - salam interaction conserves @xmath29 and fermion number , it can not mediate nucleon decay .",
    "purely leptonic transitions , such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and meson - antimeson mixing , are induced only at one loop , and vanish in the limit of zero intergenerational mixing .",
    "the natural place to search for the pati - salam interaction is therefore in meson decays .",
    "these will be considered in the following sections .",
    "the long - lived kaon , due to its longevity , is a sensitive probe of suppressed interactions which produce unusual decays .",
    "pati and salam observed that the decay @xmath32 , shown in fig .  1 , provides the best bound on the mass of the pati - salam bosons @xcite .",
    "this bound was later refined in refs .",
    "@xcite , and leading - log qcd effects were included in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we update this bound , based on the recent upper bound br ( @xmath33 ( 90@xmath34 c.l . ) from brookhaven e791 @xcite .",
    "combined with previous experiments , this yields @xmath35    the diagram in fig .",
    "1 gives rise to an effective four - fermion interaction + @xmath36 where a sum on color is implicit .",
    "@xmath37 is the mass of the pati - salam bosons , and @xmath38 is the pati - salam coupling at the scale @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath25 breaks to @xmath39 , this coupling is equal to the strong coupling at @xmath37 .",
    "a fierz rearrangement gives @xmath40\\;. \\label{eff}\\ ] ]    for @xmath32 , the required matrix elements are @xmath41 where @xcite @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the running @xmath44 quark masses evaluated at the pati - salam scale .",
    "these masses are evolved to low energy using leading - log qcd evolution @xcite , @xmath45    the light - quark @xmath44 masses are not well known , although their ratios are known from chiral perturbation theory : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , at leading order @xcite .",
    "the absolute scale of the quark masses must be obtained from nonperturbative qcd .",

    "future experiments may probe branching ratios as small as @xmath63 , increasing the lower bound on @xmath37 by a factor of about 7 .",

    "we have also considered all other meson decays mediated by pati - salam bosons : @xmath76 ; @xmath77 ; @xmath78 ; @xmath79 ; @xmath80 ; @xmath81 ; @xmath82 ; @xmath83 ; and @xmath84 .",
    "none competes with @xmath85 in its sensitivity to the pati - salam interaction .    if we associate the muon with the first generation of quarks and the electron with the second , the relevant decays are @xmath86 ; @xmath87 ; etc .",
    "the best bound on @xmath37 again comes from @xmath86 .",
    "at first sight , associating the @xmath0 lepton with the second generation of quarks and , say , the muon with the third generation seems unnatural . however , the @xmath0 lepton is comparable in mass to the second - generation charm quark .",
    "although the muon is a factor of about 40 less massive than the bottom quark , the bottom quark is at least a factor of 30 less massive than the top quark ( @xmath88 gev @xcite ) , so large intragenerational mass ratios do occur .    because the strange quark is associated with the @xmath0 lepton , the decay of @xmath89 to leptons does not occur via the pati - salam interaction .",
    "pati - salam bosons also mediate transitions between up quarks and neutrinos , so if we replace the @xmath64 quark and muon in fig .",
    "1 with an up quark and electron neutrino , we obtain the diagram for @xmath90 .",
    "this process involves only first - generation quarks .",
    "since the decay @xmath90 also proceeds via the weak interaction , the presence of a contribution from the pati - salam interaction manifests itself as a violation of lepton universality in @xmath91 @xcite .",
