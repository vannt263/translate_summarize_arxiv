    "xte j1709 - 267 is a recurrent soft x - ray transient and type 1 burst source that has a recurrence time of 2 - 3 years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the source was first discovered to be in outburst in 1997 @xcite and is associated with the globular cluster ngc 6293 @xcite .",
    "it is located a distance of 8.5 kpc away @xcite .",
    "the typical 2 - 10 kev flux during outburst is @xmath10 ergs @xmath11 s@xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "broad iron line profiles have been seen in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that contain a neutron star ( ns ) as the primary accreting compact object ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of gravitational redshift and doppler shift / boosting are imprinted on these emission lines .",
    "these relativistic effects become stronger closer to the compact object @xcite . hence",
    ", the profile of the fe k@xmath13 line gives a direct measure of the position of inner disk .",
    "furthermore , since the disk must truncate at or before the surface of the star , the fe k@xmath13 line can be used to set an upper limit for the radius of the ns ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "two likely scenarios for disk truncation above @xmath14 l@xmath2 are : ( 1 ) pressure balance between the accreting material and ns s magnetic field or ( 2 ) the boundary layer extending from the surface of the ns , impeding the disk .",
    "thus , studies of disk reflection can also be used to set an upper limit on the magnetic field strength ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or the extent of the boundary layer ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "maxi / gsc registered that xte j1709 - 267 had renewed activity in 2016 may 31 @xcite .",
    "we obtained two @xmath15 ks observations with @xmath0 @xcite during this outburst while the source was in the soft state .",
    "we detect a broad fe k@xmath13 line that we model as relativistic reflection to determine the extent of the inner accretion disk and measure the inclination .",
    "there are no previous fe k detections for this source , making this the first detailed reflection analysis .",
    "@xmath0 observations of xte j1709 - 267 were taken on 2016 june 8 ( obsids 90201025002 and 90201025003 ) .",
    "there are two detectors aboard @xmath0 that collect data : focal plane module a ( fpma ) and focal plane module b ( fpmb ) .",
    "lightcurves and spectra were created using a 120@xmath16 circular extraction region centered around the source using the tool from nustardas v1.5.1 with caldb 20160421 .",
    "a background was generated and subtracted using another region of the same dimension away from the source .",
    "there were no type 1 x - ray bursts present in the lightcurves , but there was an increase in count rate near the end of the second observation ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we create gti files in order to separate the observation by low and high count rate .",
    "preliminary modeling of the spectra with a simple continuum multiplied by a cross normalization constant is performed to determine how well the detectors agree with one another .",
    "we fixed the constant to unity for the fpma and allowed it to float for the fpmb .",
    "the floating constant was found to be within 0.95 - 1.05 in each case .",
    "we proceeded to combine the two source spectra , background spectra , and ancillary response matrices via addascaspec .",
    "we use addrmf to create a single redistribution matrix file .",
    "we then combined the two observations of the same count rate as per @xcite , resulting in a total combined exposure time for the spectrum of @xmath17 ks for the lower flux regime and @xmath18 ks for the spectrum generated from the higher flux .",
    "we will refer to these spectra as the low and high hereafter .",

    "initial fits were performed with an absorbed single temperature blackbody component ( bbodyrad ) to model the corona or boundary layer , and a multi - temperature blackbody ( diskbb ) to account for the accretion disk emission .",

    "the high flux solution gives a maximum magnetic field strength in excess of @xmath98 g ( @xmath99 g ) .",
    "however , no x - ray pulsations have been detected from this source , so there are no indications that the magnetic field has truncated the disk and channeled material to the magnetic poles .",
    "recent analyses of a similar nature have been done for @xmath0 studies of the transient ns lmxbs 1rxs j180408.9 - 34205 ( rxs j1804 ) and aquila x-1 ( aql x-1 ) .",
    "@xcite found the inner disk of rxs j1804 to be @xmath100 in the hard state .",

    "the disk is likely truncated by a boundary layer surrounding the ns .",
    "we estimate that the boundary layer extends from the surface out to @xmath88 for the mass accretion rate and efficiency of the disk . however , though viscosity and spin effects can increase the extent of the boundary layer , at low eddington fraction the boundary layer is not likely to halt the accretion disk at a large radius ( i.e. , at the large radius implied by the high flux solution ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the disk is truncated by the magnetosphere .",
    "conservative estimates place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength to be @xmath9 g at the magnetic poles , though xte j1709 - 267 is not a known x - ray pulsar .",

    "<S> we perform the _ first _ reflection study of the soft x - ray transient and type 1 burst source xte j1709 - 267 using @xmath0 observations during its 2016 june outburst . </S>",
    "<S> there was an increase in flux near the end of the observations , which corresponds to an increase from @xmath10.04 l@xmath2 to @xmath10.06 l@xmath2 assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we have separately examined spectra from the low and high flux intervals , which were soft and show evidence of a broad fe k line . </S>",
    "<S> fits to these intervals with relativistic disk reflection models have revealed an inner disk radius of @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) for the low flux spectrum and @xmath5 for the high flux spectrum at the 90% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> the disk is likely truncated by a boundary layer surrounding the neutron star or the magnetosphere . </S>",
    "<S> based on the measured luminosity and using the accretion efficiency for a disk around a neutron star , we estimate that the theoretically expected size for the boundary layer would be @xmath6 from the neutron star s surface , which can be increased by spin or viscosity effects . </S>",
    "<S> another plausible scenario is that the disk could be truncated by the magnetosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we place a conservative upper limit on the strength of the magnetic field at the poles , assuming @xmath7 and @xmath8 , of @xmath9 g , though x - ray pulsations have not been detected from this source . </S>"
