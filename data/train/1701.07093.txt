    ", ( 1 ) variation is limited to one spatial dimension in all sections but  [ flh ] on hydrodynamical fluctuations and  [ poise ] on poiseuille flow , ( 2 ) equations are linearized about a constant state in all sections but  [ shock ] on shock waves , and ( 3 ) parameters are chosen to yield phenomena strictly in the hydrodynamic ( small @xmath4 ) regime in all sections but  [ shock ] .",
    "furthermore , so as not to distract from the main results , for examples that require any mathematical complexity , such as the stochastical subjects of  [ flh ] and  [ ls ] , i provide guiding references and outline steps , but for the most part i merely present and discuss the solutions .",
    "i will treat these problems  and others that are examined only superficially here , like stability and sound propagation  with rigor in future papers .",
    "in addition , these particular examples were chosen to exhibit a wide variety of phenomena  including ones that connect the two theories and so provide anchoring points to tie @xmath0-formulation parameters to those of navier - stokes - fourier ( nsf ) , and ones that reveal major differences both measurably in experiment and conceptually .    the following is a brief description of the examples this paper contains .    * a one - dimensional linear stability analysis is carried out in  [ stability ] to show that my formulation is unconditionally stable provided that the diffusion parameter , @xmath2 , is positive . * in  [ diffusion ] , a mass equilibration problem with no mechanical forces is studied in order to show that my formulation reduces to one of pure diffusion governed by fick s law .",
    "* low amplitude sound propagation , which is the subject of  [ sound ] , is demonstrated to be a way of relating my longitudinal diffusion parameter , @xmath2 ,  to the transport parameters of the nsf formulation by matching attenuations in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "i employ this relationship to estimate values of @xmath2  for several different gases and liquids , and these are presented in appendix [ difp ] . * in  [ soundbc ]",
    ", acoustic impedance at a sound barrier is discussed .",
    "in particular , i point out that the @xmath1-formulation allows an impermeable boundary with a non - zero normal velocity at that boundary , as that which occurs in the case of non - infinite impedance . * as a step towards bridging the gap between microscopic and macroscopic scales in my theory , the subject of hydrodynamical fluctuations is addressed in  [ flh ] , where it is shown that the thermodynamic interpretation of a continuum mechanical point ( i.e. a point occupied by matter and moving with velocity @xmath5 ) stemming from the @xmath6-formulation is fundamentally different from that of navier - stokes - fourier .  that is , in the nsf theory , a continuum mechanical point is viewed as a thermodynamic subsystem in contact with its surrounding material which acts as a heat reservoir ; whereas in my theory , the surrounding material acts not only as a heat  but also a particle  reservoir . * the light scattering spectra from the @xmath6-formulation and the nsf equations are provided in  [ ls ] .",
    "comparing these , one finds the shifted brillouin peaks , which correspond to the sound ( phonon ) part of the spectrum , are virtually indistinguishable between the two theories , as one would expect , but the central rayleigh peak predictions are significantly different .",
    "for example , in a classical monatomic ideal gas in the hydrodynamic regime , the @xmath0-formulation predicts a rayleigh peak that is about @xmath7 taller and narrower than the nsf equations ( but with the same area so that the well - verified landau - placzek ratio remains intact ) .",
    "previous experimenters , e.g. clark @xcite and fookson et al .",
    "@xcite , did not study gases fully in the hydrodynamic regime , @xmath8 , choosing instead to focus on more rarefied gases with knudsen numbers in the range , @xmath9 ,  which extends into the slip flow and transition regimes .",
    "therefore , in order to verify the @xmath10-formulation , it is important to conduct a high - resolution light scattering experiment for a gas in the hydrodynamic regime . * in  [ grav ] , i study the effect of gravity on the earth s lower atmosphere , and show that enforcing no mass flux and no total energy flux conditions in the @xmath0-formulation , leads to the isentropic condition that is typically  assumed a priori .  in contrast , enforcing the same conditions in the nsf formulation , leads to an isothermal condition , which is obviously not physical . *",
    "poiseuille flow is the subject of  [ poise ] .",
    "there , i show that , when compared to the nsf mass flow rate , which is due solely to convection , the @xmath0-formulation predicts an additional contribution due to diffusion .  in the hydrodynamic regime",
    ", however , this contribution is very small ,  and so these predictions do not differ by much .  since viscometers may be based on poiseuille flow , this  and other examples of this sort ",
    "provide justification that the shear viscosity appearing in the @xmath0-formulation may be taken to be the same as the navier - stokes shear viscosity .",
    "* thermophoresis , or the down - temperature - gradient motion of a macroscopic particle in a resting fluid , is discussed in  [ therm ] .  for an idealized problem",
    ", it is shown that , through the steady - state balancing of the convective and diffusive terms of the mass flux , the @xmath6-formulation provides a mechanism for thermophoresis that is not present in the nsf formulation .  in the latter type ,",
    "a thermal slip boundary condition at the particle s surface is needed in order to model thermophoretic motion , whereas the former type may be used to describe this motion with a no - slip boundary condition , i.e. one in which the tangential velocity of the particle at its surface equals that of the fluid .",
    "the concept of thermal slip is based on kinetic gas theory arguments in the slip flow regime , appropriate for @xmath11 , yet thermophoresis is observed in gases for much smaller knudsen numbers in the hydrodynamic regime and also in liquids",
    ".  therefore , there are obvious advantages to being able to model this problem without the thermal slip condition . *",
