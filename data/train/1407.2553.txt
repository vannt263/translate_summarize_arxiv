    "the vortex defects of the phase of the pairing order parameter bind majorana zero modes that endow them with non - abelian exchange statistics  @xcite .",
    "thus , they have been proposed as potential candidates for fault - tolerant , topological quantum information processing  @xcite . in addition",
    ", they are expected to admit a quantized abelian exchange phase that plays an important role in proposals for universal topological quantum computation with vortices  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite important to formulate a cogent theory that accounts for the dynamics of vortices .    in previous work on this system ,",
    "a low - energy effective action has been derived by the standard gradient expansion method  @xcite , shedding light on the collective response of the superfluid to external electromagnetic fields . however , in this derivation vortices have been generally left out .",
    "it appears then that the abelian exchange phase of vortices , while surmised from the conformal properties of its edge states or the properties of candidate bulk wavefunctions  @xcite , has never been derived from a microscopic model  @xcite .",
    "consequently , it remains unclear whether bulk vortices in a chiral @xmath5-wave superfluid or superconductor exhibit this exchange phase and , if so , to what degree it is universal or how it is affected by the physics of the system .    to answer these questions , in this paper",
    ", we derive a @xmath8 effective gauge theory that handles vortex defects properly .",
    "the @xmath2 gauge field is governed by an action that is identical to the one previously derived by gradient expansion , including a partial chern - simons ( cs ) term .",
    "interestingly , a @xmath3 gauge field emerges in the effective theory governed by a new _ full _ abelian cs term .",
    "we show that the coefficient of the partial cs term is not a universal quantity and depends on the details of dispersion and higher - energy behavior of the system .",
    "the full cs term of the @xmath3 gauge field is , on the other hand , a truly topological term with a quantized coefficient .",
    "we calculate the exchange angle of two vortices due to each cs term and show that the new cs term dictates a universal abelian exchange statistics phase of the vortices equal to @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , for neutral superfluids , the partial cs term spoils the quantization of the exchange phase by adding a long - distance non - universal correction . for charged superfluids , screening effects exponentially diminish the latter over the effective penetration depth .",
    "this sets a low bound for the distance between vortices during exchange processes required for topological quantum computation .",
    "we start with the action for a spinless chiral @xmath5-wave superconductor  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the nambu spinors with grassmann variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the coordinate space @xmath15 . in the following",

    "we take the branch cut of @xmath36 to be the positive real axis and index the corresponding riemann sheets with the branch number @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the partition function is invariant under a unitary transformation , @xmath38 , of the inverse green s function with a jacobian of unit modulus ; that is , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are pauli matrices in the nambu space .",
    "we demand that @xmath38 respect the particle - hole symmetric structure of the spinor fields .",
    "this means that @xmath38 must transform @xmath43 in such a way that ensures one spinor remains the conjugate transpose of the other and each component of the spinor is the conjugate of the other .",
    "the requirement is equivalent to the condition @xmath44 . in the operator language",
    ", this is the condition to maintain the fermionic commutations relations under the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "one can readily show that any such @xmath38 is composed of a finite product of the following matrices : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the actual number of distinct sequences can be reduced through use of the commutations relations between the generators and is ultimately finite .    to proceed further ,",
    "it is convenient to gauge away the phase of the superconducting order parameter",
    ". this will add space - time gradients of @xmath49 to the electromagnetic potential in the kinetic term . a naive transformation , @xmath50 , which involves only the phase of the order parameter , leads to multi - valuedness in the presence of vortices . to avoid this problem anderson",
    "@xcite suggested using the transformations @xmath51 , resulting in the superfluid velocity appearing as an effective gauge field in either the electron or the hole component of the hamiltonian .",
    "this gauge choice becomes possible when opposite spins are associated with the two components of the nambu spinor .",
    "franz and teanovi  @xcite developed the transformation @xmath52 for a periodic bipartite vortex lattice , where a and b are the two sublattices .",
    "the vortices should be assigned to the subsets in such a way that the effective magnetic field vanishes on average .",
    "physically , a vortex assigned to subset a will be seen by electrons and be invisible to holes , while vortex assigned to subset b will be seen by holes and be invisible to electrons .",
    "inevitably , in both transformations , particle - hole symmetric structure of the spinors can not be maintained without additional constraints on the ensemble of allowed partitions of @xmath53 .",
    "instead , we suggest the following transformation : @xmath54 where @xmath53 is the phase function and @xmath55 keeps the transformation properly single - valued by supplying the required sign each time the winding number in @xmath53 changes as it evolves in space and time .",
    "our transformation is similar in spirit to the franz - teanovi transformation , especially as formulated in ref .  , but it manifestly preserves the particle - hole symmetry of the action . upon applying this gauge transformation ,",
    "two gauge fields appear in the action : the @xmath56 couples only to the kinetic energy terms , with opposite signs for particles and holes ; and the @xmath57 couples minimally to momentum , both in the kinetic energy and in the pairing term .",

    "the effective action , eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) , now captures correctly the physics of vortices .",
    "this is exemplified by the physical significance of each term appearing in the action .",
    "the first term gives rise to the magnus force on a moving vortex . to see this , note that for a moving vortex @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the position of the vortex .",
    "so , the first term yields @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the vortex is subject to a lorentz - like force @xmath103 where the magnus flux @xmath104 is proportional to the superfluid density .",
    "the contribution from the electromagnetic gauge field @xmath105 in a superconductor vanishes due to the overall charge neutrality of the system  @xcite .",
    "the second and third terms , in conjunction with the maxwell lagrangian , give rise to the usual screening of vortices through the meissner effect .",
    "the second term also contributes to the mass of the vortex by generating a term @xmath106 in the action , where @xmath107 .",
    "the fourth and fifth terms , as we now show , carry significant information about the dynamics of vortices . previous work on the effective low - energy theory of the @xmath5-wave superconductor , using only the @xmath2 part of our transformation  @xcite ,",
    "yielded an action similar to that of an s - wave superconductor but with an additional partial cs term .",
    "stone and roy  @xcite attributed this partial cs term to the existence of a hall - like response to external fields .",
    "they recognized that the hall current depends on the external field primarily through its effect in modifying the density .",
    "note that the partial cs term we derive here is different from the one appearing in the literature , since in our case @xmath108 is explicitly nonzero due to the presence of vorticity in @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , the full cs term derived here is entirely absent in previous work .",
    "as we show now , both of these terms have significant contributions to the exchange statistics of vortices",
    ".    vortices in chiral @xmath5-wave superconductors are known to obey non - abelian statistics , the mechanism behind which relates to the majorana zero modes localized at their cores . in the presence of @xmath109 vortices ,",
    "the ground state of the system is @xmath110-fold degenerate .",
    "this degenerate ground state is further divided into two sectors of definite parity @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the total fermion number .",
    "the full braid statistics of vortices can be written using three matrices : @xmath113 ; @xmath114 ; and @xmath115 .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath113 specifies the exchange of two vortices when their fusion outcome is known , @xmath114 specifies the associativity of the exchange among three anyons , and @xmath116 is the generator of the full braid group of the vortices in the model .",
    "the possible choices of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are constrained by consistency relationships .",
    "these matrices have been computed for a chiral @xmath5-wave superconductor by ivanov @xcite and found to be , up to an overall phase , proportional to those in the ising anyon model . in this model , a vortex , @xmath117 , and antivortex , @xmath118 , fuse according to the fusion rule @xmath119 , where the fusion channels @xmath120 and @xmath121 are , respectively , the vacuum ( boson ) and fermion . in this basis",
    ", the @xmath114-matrix is real and is given by @xmath122 , while @xmath123 .",
    "the phase @xmath124 is fixed in this model by consistency relations between @xmath113 and @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "however , without a full calculation of @xmath125 in the chiral @xmath5-wave superconductor , one can not make a meaningful connection to the ising anyon model .",
    "our strategy in this work is to calculate @xmath125 by performing a monodromy , which describes a full encircling of one vortex around the other .",
    "a general argument shows that the monodromy in the vacuum fusion channel is @xmath126  @xcite .",
    "this calculation may be done in the same ground state without complications due to the ground - state degeneracy . in our field theory , the monodromy is the berry s phase in the matrix element of the evolution operator for the exchange of two vortices in the even - parity ground state  @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : exch ] for illustration .",
    "[ fig2 ]    at first sight , the @xmath3 nature of the @xmath58 gauge field in our effective theory seems to make the calculation of the berry s phase due to the full cs term tricky .",
    "however , this situation is similar to the situation encountered in the singular string gauge of the more common @xmath2 gauge theory , in which the gauge field is zero everywhere except on a string emanating from the vortex .",
    "one may show that the string gauge is continuously connected to a smooth gauge without changing the winding numbers along the process .",
    "therefore , we can calculate the berry s phase contribution of the @xmath58 gauge field in the usual way by writing @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are associated with the two vortices , and considering the cross terms between them . both cross terms contribute equally since , by partial integration , @xmath130 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that only vortex 2 is moving , we have @xmath131 , and @xmath132 which is , as advertised , quantized in the weak pairing ( topological ) regime to the value @xmath133 .",
    "the partial cs term in  ( [ eq : action ] ) also contributes to the berry s phase , albeit not in a quantized fashion due to the non - universal behavior of @xmath134 .",
    "we write again @xmath135 for two vortices and consider the cross terms in the cs term between @xmath136 and @xmath137 . in a superfluid",
    "the external electromagnetic gauge field is absent and we have @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the position of vortex 1 , and similarly for @xmath137 .",
    "the calculation is simplified by assuming that only vortex @xmath140 moves , so that @xmath141",
    ". then , only one of the cross terms contributes and @xmath142 in a neutral superfluid , this leads to a non - universal long range contribution to the exchange phase of vortices .",
    "by contrast , for a charged superfluid , the screened magnetic field is screened as @xmath143 , associated with a vortex at the origin , where @xmath144 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath145 is the ( effective ) penetration depth .",
    "this modifies the result by a geometric phase , @xmath146,\\ ] ] for a circular exchange at distance @xmath147 .",
    "so , in a superconductor the total exchange angle due the partial cs term is @xmath148 when the distance between the vortices is much longer than @xmath145 this exchange angle vanishes exactly .",
    "however , at distances smaller or comparable to @xmath145 , non - universal contributions to the exchange phase will occur .",
    "therefore , the total exchange angle @xmath149 depends on the details of the dispersion and , in particular , is different in a chiral @xmath5-wave superfluid from that in a superconductor due to screening effects .",
    "in the derivation above we concentrated on the case where the size of the core of the vortex is vanishingly smaller compared to other length scales . we note that even in this limit , the @xmath150 winding of the phase entails the presence of the protected zero mode in the topological phase .",
    "in addition , higher - energy subgap states may occur , localized at the vortex core  @xcite .",
    "the field theory presented above would include the effects of both the zero mode and the subgap states in the two gauge fields @xmath71 and @xmath58 if all orders of the loop expansion are retained . to the second order",
    ", we find only the chern - simons term , which fully encodes the topological exchange phase .",
    "this phase is quantized and can not be modified without closure of the gap .",
    "non - universal effects associated with the subgap states may occur in higher order in perturbation theory , which may include effects such as population transfer between closely separated intra - vortex states  @xcite .",
    "taking a finite core size may allow additional localized sub - gap states to get trapped within the vortex .",
    "one can model this case by varying the chemical potential @xmath29 around the vortex through the topological phase transition between the topological weak - pairing phase ( @xmath151 ) outside of the vortex core and the non - topological strong - pairing phase ( @xmath83 ) within the vortex core .",
    "as far as topological properties are concerned , this is equivalent to taking the order parameter to zero at the vortex core but lends itself better to field theoretical analysis  @xcite . in this description ,",
    "the loci of @xmath152 that encircle the vortices cores are internal edges of the system and accommodate gapless excitations .",
    "although their proximity to the majorana zero modes may affect the coherence of the vortices  @xcite , as long as they do not mix with the continuum states the majorana zero mode remains intact  @xcite . to incorporate this into our field theory ,",
    "we take the chemical potential to be @xmath153 , where @xmath154 denotes the deviation from @xmath29 and has support mostly within the vortex core , i.e. , within the coherence length . the new term can be absorbed into @xmath155 .",
    "one new term that appears in the field theory , @xmath156 , pushes vortices to diffuse along the chemical potential gradient occurring due to other vortices when their cores overlap . a second term @xmath157 generates energetic contributions which go to zero at distances that are larger than the coherence or penetration lengths ( whichever is larger ) .",
    "since there is no coupling between @xmath71 and @xmath58 in the effective theory , this modification does not change the topological cs term . at distances larger than the coherence length and to second order in perturbation theory , we find no contribution to the topological abelian phase associated with the exchange of vortices .",
    "it is also illuminating to compare our results to the non - abelian moore - read state , which is one of the prominent candidate wavefunctions describing the quantum hall plateau at filling factor @xmath158 @xcite . while lying in the same universality class of ising anyons as chiral @xmath5-wave superfluids , the moore - read state is realized at large magnetic fields , leading to the appearance of an additional chern - simons term in the mean - field action .",
    "this extra term endows the quasi - particles with an @xmath159 charge and half a flux quantum of fictitious magnetic field .",
    "consequently , there is an additional @xmath133 exchange phase for quasi - particles which should be added to the pure ising @xmath133 contribution , for a total exchange phase of @xmath160 .",
    "non - universal deviations from this value must be governed by the magnetic length , so any mapping of our results to the moore - read state , if it at all exists , remains to be worked out .",
    "in contrast to the moore - read state , our main result here demonstrates that vortices in a screened chiral @xmath5-wave superconductor could realize a pristine ising anyon model .",
    "we have derived an effective action of vortices in a spinless chiral @xmath5-wave superfluid by properly treating the vortex branch cuts and revealed an abelian @xmath3 gauge structure for the chiral @xmath5-wave superfluid . in principle , our transformation is applicable to any pairing symmetry and arbitrary distribution of vortices . in the @xmath161-wave case , we have checked that this does not produce additional terms in the action . in the @xmath86-wave case",
    "a similar approach has been used to formulate an effective theory of cuprate superconductors  @xcite , but no cs term was found .",
    "the topological quantum computation scheme relies on adiabatic braiding of non - abelian anyons to generate the quantum computation . among non - abelian anyon models .",
    "majorana fermions are arguably the closest to experimental work . however , braiding of vortices carrying majorana fermions is non - universal unless supplemented by a missing @xmath133 gate .",
    "while this gate can be generated by sacrificing topological protection it remains of fundamental importance to provide a proof - of - principle topological scheme to supply the missing @xmath133 gate , thus avoiding costly error protection protocols .",
    "the results presented here allow the realization of the missing @xmath133 gate through multiple braiding of the anyons  @xcite .",
    "as argued above , such braidings should be performed at distances larger than both the coherence length and the screening length .    in this work ,",
    "we restricted our attention to the abelian gauge transformations  ( [ eq : u ] ) .",
    "this is enough to infer the abelian exchange phase of vortices .",
    "it can also be used to deduce the existence of zero energy majorana modes . using the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian density ,",
    "we can write the number density of zero modes as @xmath162  @xcite . now , since @xmath163 and @xmath58 is defined as a @xmath3 gauge field , we find @xmath164 which is quantized and equal to the single winding vortex density ( mod 2 ) in the weak pairing regime .",
    "a natural question for future work is whether the other parts of the full group of gauge transformations harbor additional physics . indeed , as is well known , the zero energy majorana modes endow the vortices with the non - abelian statistics of ising anyons  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see if such a non - abelian representation emerges in the gauge structure of the effective vortex action by using the entire group of gauge transformations .",

    "<S> more importantly , it predicts a universal abelian phase , @xmath4 , upon the exchange of two vortices . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is modified by non - universal corrections due to the partial chern - simon term , which are nevertheless screened in a charged superfluid at distances that are larger than the penetration depth . </S>"
