    "the near - infrared wavelength range offers valuable probes of the dynamics , composition , and excitation mechanisms present in the circumnuclear gas of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . among the near - infrared emission lines which have been observed to be strongest in seyfert galaxies",
    "are the recombination lines of hydrogen , pa@xmath1  ( @xmath2=1.2818@xmath3 m ) and br@xmath4  ( @xmath2=2.1655@xmath3 m ) , collisionally excited lines of singly ionized iron , e.g. , [ ] ( @xmath2=1.2567@xmath3 m ) , and rotational - vibrational lines of molecular hydrogen , e.g. , h@xmath5  @xmath6=10s(1 ) ( @xmath2=2.1212@xmath3 m ) .",
    "additionally , there are very high excitation coronal lines , e.g. , [ ]  ( @xmath2=1.2525@xmath3 m ) , which have been seen in a number of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to date , most published infrared spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies use single large beams centered on the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , very little spatial information on the strong near - infrared lines is available .",
    "however , some studies have shown that near - infrared line emission is extended over a spatial scale easily probed with ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "for example , near - infrared [ ]  and h@xmath5  emission has been seen extended over several arcseconds ( @xmath71  kpc ) in the nucleus of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068 @xcite , the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc  7469 @xcite , and the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc  4151 @xcite . in each case , there were overall spatial and kinematic similarities between the infrared and optical line emission , but differences were also apparent on spatial and velocity scales within the nlr . clearly , there is important diagnostic information about the circumnuclear regions of seyfert 2 galaxies to be gained from spatially resolved near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "this paper presents longslit near - infrared spectra of the seyfert 2 galaxies mk  1066 , ngc  2110 , ngc  4388 , and mk  3 , in wavelength ranges which include the lines pa@xmath1 , br@xmath4 , [ ]  ( @xmath2=1.2567@xmath3 m ) , h@xmath5  @xmath6=10  s(1 ) , and [ ] ( @xmath2=1.2525@xmath3 m ) .",
    "these four objects were chosen from a larger project to search for spatially extended infrared line emission in @xmath820 seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies . because desirable targets in this larger project were those likely to show extended emission , seyfert galaxies visible from palomar observatory ( @xmath9 )",
    "were selected with redshift cz@xmath105400  km  s@xmath11 , corresponding to a spatial scale of 350  pc/@xmath12 .",
    "( throughout this paper , for the determination of distances and hence projected scales , we assume @xmath13  km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 . ) galaxies with known extended optical ionized gas were preferentially observed , followed in priority by galaxies with spatially extended radio emission on scales of @xmath14 .",
    "the final sample of galaxies observed includes 11 seyfert  1.x ( 1 , 1.5 , and 1.9 ) galaxies and 12 seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "this paper reports the results from this program for the four seyfert  2 galaxies that show the best well - detected extended circumnuclear emission line regions in the near - infrared .    throughout this paper , for the determination of distances and hence projected scales , we assume @xmath13  km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the near - infrared spectra discussed in this paper were obtained at the hale  200@xmath12 telescope with the palomar near - infrared spectrometer @xcite .",
    "observations at resolution @xmath0 were made in two spectral ranges for each galaxy .",
    "one spectral range in the j - band atmospheric window covers 0.07@xmath3 m and includes the [ ] , [ ] , and pa@xmath1  lines in the rest frame of each galaxy .",
    "the other spectral range in the k - band atmospheric window covers 0.13@xmath3 m and includes the h@xmath5  @xmath6=10  s(1 ) and br@xmath4  lines .",
    "table  [ sey2obslog ] is a log of the observations , including the resolution ( in km  s@xmath11 ) , on - source integration time , and position angle of the slit for each observation . since we are interested in exploring the near infrared emission line flux ratios and dynamics as a function of distance from the seyfert nucleus , we chose slit position angles to coincide with the position angle of known ionization cones or other anisotropy previously mapped through narrow band optical emission line imaging . in the case of two of the galaxies ( mk  1066 and ngc  4388 ) ,",
    "there are additional observations along a secondary slit through the nucleus , perpendicular to the primary position angle .",
    "the spectrometer is a reimaging system which disperses the light from the telescope and feeds the spectra to an externally mounted infrared camera .",
    "the spatial scale of the 256@xmath15256 nicmos hgcdte array in the camera is 0.165@xmath12  pixel@xmath11 .",
    "the width of the adjustable slit was approximately 0.6@xmath12 , yielding the resolutions listed in table  [ sey2obslog ] . in order to accurately center",
    "the nucleus in the slit , a fold mirror inside the spectrometer , but in front of the grating , allows infrared imaging with a @xmath16 field of view . between subsequent observations of each galaxy ,",
    "the nucleus was moved back and forth along the slit by 20@xmath12 , to allow for background subtraction while maximizing the amount of on - source integration time .",
    "each individual exposure was 600s for the j - band ( 1.2@xmath3 m ) wavelength range , and 300s for the k - band ( 2.2@xmath3 m ) wavelength range .",
    "along with the observation of each galaxy , we observed a g - dwarf star at a similar airmass ( within 0.1 of that of the galaxy ) , and where possible in the same area of the sky , in order to correct for atmospheric transmission . a chopping secondary mirror on the telescope uniformly spread the light of this star along the length of the slit .",
    "in this way , the spectrum of the atmospheric calibrator is also used as a flat - field .",
    "the data were reduced following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "bad pixels were removed by linear interpolation , and the spatial and spectral curvature of the field of view was measured and removed using a point source spectrum and the spectrally unresolved oh night sky lines .",
    "spectral data frames were divided by the appropriate g - star spectrum , in order to remove atmospheric absorption lines and to correct for efficiency variations across the field of view . in order to correct for the blackbody slope of the g - star continuum , and to remove absorption features intrinsic to the star , each g - star spectrum",

    "these spectra show strong line emission , concentrated on the nucleus .",
    "four emission lines are visible in figures  [ mk1066grey ] , [ mk1066spec135 ] , and [ mk1066spec45 ] : pa@xmath1  and [ ]  in the j - band spectra , and br@xmath4  and h@xmath5  @xmath6=10  s(1 ) in the k - band spectra .",

    ", it would be at a velocity of @xmath26  km  s@xmath11relative to the centroid of the pa@xmath1  emission , which is higher than the velocities observed in other lines in mk  1066 .",
    "these blue features on pa@xmath1  are probably primarily due to a blend of two  lines at 1.2785@xmath3 m and 1.2791@xmath3 m , which have been resolved from pa@xmath1  in high resolution spectroscopy of the planetary nebula bd@xmath27 @xcite .",

    "table  [ mk1066eqw ] in appendix  [ sec : tabappndx ] lists the equivalent widths and flux ratios of the lines observed in mk  1066 . because [ ]  and pa@xmath1  were observed simultaneously and",

    "[ sec : mk1066wings ]    figure  [ mk1066lv ] is a set of position versus velocity plots along the 135@xmath17 slit for each of the four lines identified in figures  [ mk1066spec135 ] and [ mk1066spec45 ] . in each case",
    ", a smoothed continuum has been subtracted from the spectrum .",
    "velocity is plotted relative to 3625  km  s@xmath11 , the systemic velocity of mk  1066 @xcite , and position is distance in arcseconds on the sky from the continuum peak .",
    "a velocity gradient is visible in each of the lines , in the sense that the lines are blueshifted southeast of the nucleus and redshifted northwest of the nucleus .",
    "the slope of the velocity gradient does not appear to be the same for all of the lines .",
    "specifically , the h@xmath5  line appears to have a steeper gradient ( @xmath8300  km  s@xmath11  arcsec@xmath11 , or @xmath81300  km  s@xmath11  kpc@xmath11 ) in comparison to the other three lines ( whose gradients are @xmath8200  km  s@xmath11  arcsec@xmath11 , or @xmath8900  km  s@xmath11  kpc@xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , br@xmath4  appears to have a slightly steeper gradient ( by @xmath850  km  s@xmath11  arcsec@xmath11 ) than pa@xmath1  southeast of the nucleus .",
    "the gradients of the [ ]  and pa@xmath1  lines are similar .",
    "another feature apparent in figure  [ mk1066lv ] is that all of the lines , except for br@xmath4 , peak northwest of the nucleus .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ mk1066extinction ] .",
    "table  [ mk1066kinematics ] in appendix  [ sec : tabappndx ] lists the velocity centroids and full widths at half maxima of the complete line profiles for the lines observed in mk  1066 along both slits in each spatial bin .",
    "many of the lines show a complicated asymmetric profile .",
    "these lines were decomposed into the smallest number of gaussian components necessary to statistically describe the line profile .",
    "figure  [ mk1066vvspos ] shows plots of the velocity of the strongest narrow gaussian component of each line as a function of position along the slit .",
    "usually , this is equivalent to a plot of the mode ( peak ) of the line profile as a function of position , because most of the line profiles in mk  1066 are dominated by a strong , central narrow component .",
    "for reference , a line connecting the br@xmath4  velocity peaks is drawn on each plot , and the h@xmath19 velocity curve @xcite is shown on the pa@xmath1  plot .",
    "the same relative velocity gradients between the different species mentioned for figure  [ mk1066lv ] are visible in figure  [ mk1066vvspos ] .",
    "it is apparent the difference between the h@xmath5  and br@xmath4  velocity slopes is greater than the difference between the h@xmath5  and pa@xmath1  velocity slopes .",
    "two arcseconds southeast of the nucleus , all of the velocity profiles except for that of br@xmath4  ( which is undetected ) show a local velocity reversal of 5075  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "in addition to the primary narrow emission line components whose centroid velocities are plotted in figure  [ mk1066vvspos ] , there are weaker components which are displaced in velocity relative to the center of the lines . southeast of the nucleus , where the peaks of the line profiles are blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity , all of the lines show a noticeable enhanced red wing ( although it is very weak in h@xmath5 ) . on the nucleus and to the northwest where the peaks of the line profiles are redshifted , the pa@xmath1  and [ ]  lines show an enhanced blue wing .",
    "while this blue wing is almost certainly a feature of the [ ]  line profile itself , the blue wing of the pa@xmath1  line suffers contamination from other species as discussed above",
    ".    for illustration , figure  [ mk1066closeups ] shows the profiles of the [ ] , pa@xmath1 , and br@xmath4  lines on the nucleus and 1.33@xmath12 southeast and northwest of the nucleus .",
    "southeast of the nucleus , the red wing is stronger relative to the rest of the line in [ ]  and br@xmath4  than it is in pa@xmath1 .",
    "similarly , northwest of the nucleus , the blue wing is most prominent in [ ] .",
    "it is not visible in the br@xmath4  line , and in pa@xmath1  it may be contaminated by the aforementioned  and [ ]  lines .",
    "@xcite present longslit optical spectroscopy of mk  1066 along a 134@xmath17 slit .",
    "the h@xmath19 , h@xmath1 , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , and [ oi ] lines all have a velocity gradient extending from + 100  km  s@xmath11  2 - 3@xmath12 northwest of the nucleus to -90  km  s@xmath11  2 - 3@xmath12 southeast of the nucleus .",
    "this is similar to the velocity structure seen in the infrared lines ( see figure  [ mk1066vvspos ] ) , although the peaks of the pa@xmath1  and particularly the br@xmath4  lines are slightly blueshifted relative to the optical lines to the southeast of the nucleus .",
    "in addition to the primary kinematic component seen in optical emission lines , @xcite identify a second kinematical component , most clearly seen in [ oiii ] .",
    "the [ oiii ] emission is slightly blueshifted relative to the other lines northwest of the nucleus and redshifted by as much as 200  km  s@xmath11relative to the other lines southeast of the nucleus .",
    "this structure is qualitatively similar to the enhanced wings seen in the infrared lines discussed in section  [ sec : mk1066wings ] .",
    "specifically , the infrared lines show an enhancement blueward of the peak on the nucleus and to the northwest , and they show an enhancement redward of the peak to the southeast .",
    "it is likely that some of the wings seen on the infrared emission lines are associated with the kinematic component @xcite identify in [ oiii ] .      since pa@xmath1  and br@xmath4  are both hydrogen recombination lines ( n=53 and n=74 respectively ) , they should arise in the same physical locations .",
    "their intrinsic case b flux ratio is well known ( assuming radiative transfer effects are negligible ) . because of reddening , in dusty regions the observed pa@xmath1  line will be suppressed relative to the observed br@xmath4  line .",
    "if the dust is intermixed with the line emitting clouds , and there are strong velocity gradients , the two lines can appear to have different velocity structures . in mk  1066 , both",
    "the infrared and optical data indicate that extinction effects are stronger to the southeast than they are to the northwest .",
    "a difference in both the spatial and velocity distributions of pa@xmath1  and br@xmath4  is visible in figure  [ mk1066lv ] .",
    "the br@xmath4  line is peaked close to the continuum peak , and is stronger relative to pa@xmath1  toward the southeast than it is toward the northwest .",
    "the simplest explanation of this difference is a larger extinction in the southeast .",
    "spatially variable extinction may also be responsible for the slightly different pa@xmath1  and br@xmath4  velocity gradients seen in figure  [ mk1066lv ] .",
    "to the southeast , where dust extinction appears greater , the discrepancy between the velocity gradients for the pa@xmath1  and br@xmath4  lines is larger .",
    "extinction could also explain the difference between the velocities of the infrared lines and the optical h@xmath19 line southeast of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath19-infrared slope discrepancy is in the same sense as the pa@xmath1br@xmath4  slope discrepancy , i.e. , lines at shorter wavelengths have shallower gradients ; see figure  [ mk1066vvspos ] .",
    "this same extinction effect is seen in the red wings of the pa@xmath1  and br@xmath4  lines southeast of the nucleus as discussed in section  [ sec : mk1066wings ] ; the wing is relatively more prominent in br@xmath4  than in pa@xmath1 suggesting that the extinction to the region where the wings originate is greater than the extinction to the region where the bulk of the line emission originates .",
    "if the wings represent outflowing gas , then the redshifted receding gas , which may be partially obscured by dust in the disk of the galaxy , would show higher extinction .",
    "there is also evidence from optical wavelengths that the outflowing gas in the southeast is heavily extinguished .",
    "the optical line emission is seen emerging from the nucleus in ionization cones at position angles of 135@xmath17/315@xmath17 .",
    "the [ oiii]+h@xmath1 narrowband image @xcite is much stronger to the northwest , suggesting suppressed emission to the southeast .",
    "the 5  ghz radio emission @xcite indicates that the strength of the outflow is slightly asymmetric , but the difference in the strength of the radio emission northwest and southeast of the nucleus is not as great as the difference in the strength of the [ oiii ] emission which @xcite associate with the outflow .",
    "extinction can not explain the discrepancies between the h@xmath5  and br@xmath4lines , since the differential extinction between the two is negligible .",
    "the h@xmath5  line shows a different velocity gradient than br@xmath4(figure  [ mk1066lv ] ) , and the peak of the h@xmath5  emission is shifted to the northwest relative to the peak of the br@xmath4  emission .",
    "the differences in the structure of these lines may indicate that the emission seen from each species originates from different clouds along the same line of sight .",
    "additionally , there may be a systematic variation in the physical conditions along the cone axis of the galaxy .",
    "the infrared data in combination with the data in @xcite indicate that there are two dominant kinematic components in near the nucleus of mk  1066 .",
    "one component shows up in infrared h@xmath5 , in the peaks of the infrared lines , and in optical h@xmath19 , [ ] , and other species .",
    "this component shows a clear velocity gradient along the 135@xmath17 slit , is blueshifted to the southeast , and is redshifted to the northwest .",
    "the second , higher - excitation component shows up in the wings on the infrared lines and in optical [ ] , and has the opposite velocity trend from the first component .",
    "@xcite identify the first , low - excitation component with a rotating disk .",
    "the velocity gradient seen in the infrared line emission for this component along the 135@xmath17 slit is consistent with a rotation .",
    "the much smaller ( though non - zero ) velocity gradient along the 45@xmath17 slit indicates that the major axis of the rotating disk must be closer to 135@xmath17 than 45@xmath17 ; a fit of a uniformly rotating disk to the peaks of the infrared line emission along both slits suggests that the major axis of the disk is at @xmath34 .",
    "following @xcite , we identify the second component with high - excitation outflowing gas .",
    "this second component is not seen off of the nucleus in the infrared spectra along the 45@xmath17 slit , and the optical [ ] emission is clearly extended along an angle of @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , the data indicate that the outflow is _ not _ perpendicular to the rotating disk ; rather , the two physical systems are at low relative inclination when projected on to the plane the sky .",
    "figure  [ mk1066art ] is a cartoon drawing of the system based on the optical and infrared data . in this picture",
    ", there is an inclined disk with a major axis of 120@xmath17 projected on the sky .",
    "this orientation explains both the greater spatial extent and the larger velocity gradient in the infrared lines along the 135@xmath17 slit .",
    "the disk is dusty , explaining the extinction effects discussed in section  [ mk1066extinction ] .",
    "there is a biconical outflow associated with the higher - excitation gas , as drawn . to the northwest",
    ", this outflow is relatively unobscured , as it is in front of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the blue wings seen on the infrared lines to the northwest are associated with this outflow . to the southeast ,",
    "the outflow is obscured by the plane of the galaxy , suppressing the [ oiii ] emission observed in that direction .",
    "extinction resulting from this obscuration enhances the br@xmath4/pa@xmath1  ratio on the red side of the line profile southeast of the nucleus ( see figure  [ mk1066closeups ] ) .",
    "the fact that various features of the [ ]  emission line profiles correspond to those identified with the active nucleus in other species , such as the wings seen in [ oiii ] @xcite , suggests that the [ ] emission is dominated by processes directly associated with the seyfert nucleus .",
    "the radio emission of mk  1066 @xcite appears to represent two oppositely directed radio jets aligned with the outflow seen in [ oiii ] . in the wings on the infrared line profiles we associate with this outflow , [ ]  emission is enhanced relative to pa@xmath1  ( see figure  [ mk1066closeups ] ) .",
    "shocks resulting from the interaction of outflowing radio plasma with the ambient gas are a natural mechanism for the production of [ ]  emission .",
    "fast shocks can both destroy dust grains , increasing the gas phase abundance of iron , and create large partially ionized regions , two conditions which enhance [ ]  emission .",
    "the most striking feature of the h@xmath5  emission is that its strength does not drop off as quickly with distance as the other infrared lines from the nucleus perpendicular to the outflow axis . while br@xmath4  is only detected out to 150pc from the nucleus at a position angle of 45@xmath17 , h@xmath5  is detected to @xmath32300pc .",
    "the presence of h@xmath5  emisison along both slits shows that warm molecular gas is ubiquitous in the near - nuclear disk of mk  1066 . since the h@xmath5",
    "is not confined to the cone axis , it is evidently not directly dependent on ionization from the active nucleus or the radio jets for its excitation .",
    "there is probably little h@xmath5  emission associated with the high excitation outflow , since the wings seen in the [ ]  and pa@xmath1  lines associated with this outflow were not detected in the h@xmath5  line profiles .",
    "heating by x - rays from the seyfert nucleus likely can not explain the extent of the h@xmath5  emission perpendicular to the ionization cone axis .",
    "slow ( v@xmath36  km  s@xmath11 ) shocks originating in the nucleus may heat molecular clouds in the disk of the galaxy immediately surounding the nucleus , but the relatively flatter distribution of h@xmath5  relative to the other species along the 45@xmath17 slit argues for an extended source of heating for the molecular gas in the regions within @xmath37  pc of the nucleus of mk  1066 .      1 .   the infrared pa@xmath1 , br@xmath4 , and [ ]  lines are extended over 5@xmath12 ( 1.2",

    "this enhanced redshifted emission 1@xmath12 west of the nucleus also has a larger br@xmath4/pa@xmath1  flux ratio , suggesting higher extinction to the region which is the source of the enhanced [ ]  emission .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of the region as a receding outflow which is partially obscured by the galactic disk .",
    "the eastern radio peak is too close ( 0.4@xmath12 ) to the nucleus to distinguish infrared line emission spatially coincident with it from emission directly from the nucleus .",
    "however , if the two knots of radio emission represent the radio lobes associated with a biconical outflow , the enhanced blue wings in the infrared and optical lines on the nucleus may in fact be correlated with the second radio lobe . higher resolution 5  ghz maps of mk  3",

    "the [ ]  emission on the nucleus is blueshifted relative to the pa@xmath1  emission , suggesting that the [ ] /pa@xmath1  flux ratio may be enhanced at the position of the eastern radio peaks .",
    "given this spatial correspondence , it is likely that the [ ]  emission is enhanced by fast shocks resulting from the interaction of the radio jet and the circumnuclear gas .    except for the anomalously high value 2@xmath12 west of the nucleus , the h@xmath5/br@xmath4  ratio is lower in mk  3 than it is in most seyfert galaxies . west of the nucleus",
    ", the narrow pa@xmath1  and perhaps br@xmath4  emission may be associated with the rotation of a galactic disk , based on similarities with optical lines @xcite . at these positions ,",
    "the h@xmath5  emission is suppressed relative to the br@xmath4  emission , indicating that mk  3 continues relatively little warm molecular gas .      1 .   at a position angle of 113@xmath17 , the infrared line emission is observed to be extended by @xmath97 .",

    "there is a red wing on the line profiles , arising from a region of relatively high extinction , @xmath93 west of the nucleus .",
    "this red wing corresponds to a redshifted component seen in optical emission @xcite .",
    "both wings are spatially consistent with the position of two radio peaks @xcite .",
    "3 .   the pa@xmath1  and br@xmath4  narrow line peaks may follow a barely resolved smooth velocity gradient which lies at @xmath109  km  s@xmath11  east of the nucleus and @xmath110  km  s@xmath11  west of the nucleus .",
    "east of the nucleus , the br@xmath4  line is marginally blueshifted relative to pa@xmath1 .",
    "the [ ]  emission is blueshifted relative to the pa@xmath1  emission both east of the nucleus , and significantly so on the nucleus .",
    "the [ ] /pa@xmath1  flux ratio monotonically increases from @xmath111 to @xmath112 over 5@xmath12 from east to west across the nucleus .",
    "the h@xmath5/br@xmath4  flux ratio is close to @xmath102 everywhere except where it is anamalously high , possibly as a result of an artifact , 2@xmath12 west of the nucleus .",
    "we suggest that emission associated with an outflow of ionized gas contributes significantly to the infrared line emission in mk  3 .",
    "the [ ] /pa@xmath1  ratio is enhanced in components identified with this outflow and coincident with the 2 cm radio lobes , suggesting a possible shock contribution to the [ ]  emission .",
    "the low h@xmath5/br@xmath4  ratio indicates that in contrast to other sefyert galaxies , the circumnuclear disk is relatively depleted in warm molecular gas .",
    "one obvious conclusion from the data presented here is that the [ ] /pa@xmath1ratio in seyfert galaxies varies significantly with position on scales of @xmath113 . of",
    "the four galaxies observed , each showed a different dependence of [ ] /pa@xmath1  on position , whether it is monotonically increasing across the nucleus ( mk  3 ) , highest at the nucleus ( ngc  2110 ) , lowest at the nucleus ( ngc  4388 ) , or close to constant with point - to - point variations ( mk  1066 ) .",
    "these data show that flux ratios integrated over large nuclear beams may be of limited value for drawing conclusions about the excitation processes of the infrared lines .",
    "the flux ratios are observed to vary significantly on scales of @xmath114  pc , and to show significant velocity structure .",
    "circumnuclear starbursts and processes associated with the central agn directly have both been implicated in the generation of [ ]  emission lines seen in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . our data in general support the active nucleus as the power source of [ ]  in the seyfert galaxies .",
    "despite the differences in the details of the velocity structure of the infrared lines , the velocity gradients of [ ]  tend to match those of pa@xmath1  and br@xmath4 .",
    "the [ ]  line can generally be kinematically associated with other spectral features linked with the nuclear activity ( e.g. , [ oiii ] ) , or sites of enhanced radio emission .",
    "the one exception is the extended [ ]  emission along position angle 120@xmath17 in ngc  4388 .",
    "there are two primary proposed mechanisms for [ ]  emission associated with the agn itself .",
    "because the ionization potential of fe@xmath74 is only 16.2  ev , the [ ]  line will be strong in partially ionized regions .",
    "if clouds illuminated by the seyfert nucleus have a high enough column density , only the side of the cloud facing the nuclear ionizing source will be fully ionized .",
    "because the ionization cross section for high - energy x - rays is relatively small , x - rays can penetrate deeply into these dense clouds , creating large warm partially ionized regions suitable for [ ]  emission @xcite .",
    "fast shocks can also produce partially ionized regions heated to 6000  k @xcite .",
    "models indicate that these shocks may also destroy dust grains @xcite .",
    "because much of the iron in the local interstellar medium is locked up in dust grains , the destruction of those grains would enhance the gas phase fe abundance , thereby increasing the infrared [ ]  emission .",
    "@xcite report a slightly stronger correlation between infrared [ ]  and 6 cm radio emission than between pa@xmath1  and 6 cm emission .",
    "based on the difference in the correlations , @xcite conclude that @xmath115% of the [ ]  emission in seyfert galaxies is due to the action of fast shocks , and that the bulk of it is due to x - ray photoionization .",
    "the data presented here for mk  1066 , ngc  2110 , ngc  4388 , and mk  3 , combined with the calculations of @xcite , provide spatial and kinematic evidence that indicate that x - ray photoionization is responsible for most of the [ ]  emission , but that the [ ] emission is probably enhanced in some places by a contribution from shocks . in most cases the [ ]  emission tends to be spatially associated with the pa@xmath1  emission , and the primary component of [ ] often shares the same velocity structure as the pa@xmath1  line .",
    "thus , most of the [ ]  emission probably comes from gas physically and kinematically associated with the nlr , as traced by the pa@xmath1  emission .",
    "except for the nucleus of ngc  2110 , the flux ratios observed at various positions in the galaxies are within the range of those seen in the spectra of @xcite .",
    "while the bulk of the [ ]  appears to be photoionized , there are clear signatures of local enhancements of the [ ]  emission from shocks associated with the expanding radio plasma . in all four of the galaxies ,",
    "spectral features were identified in the [ ]  emission line profile which occured at or near the position of peaks in the non - thermal radio emission . in many cases",
    ", these features showed relatively high [ ] /pa@xmath1  ratios . in mk  3 and",
    "ngc  4388 , the [ ] emission was enhanced relative to the pa@xmath1  emission , or showed the largest kinematical differences from the pa@xmath1  emission , at positions spatially coincident with radio peaks .",
    "this suggests that processes associated with radio jets are contributing measurably to the [ ] emission .",
    "the most probable explanation of this is fast shocks resulting from the interaction of outflowing radio plasma with the circumnuclear gas .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission can result from ultraviolet fluorescence of hydrogen molecules in photodissociation regions illuminated by photons from ob stars or by a nuclear uv continuum source .",
    "alternatively , the h@xmath5emission may be excited thermally , through either slow ( v@xmath36  km  s@xmath11 ) shocks @xcite , or through x - ray heating of dense molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "observations of the flux ratio between h@xmath5  ( @xmath6=10 s(1 ) ) ( @xmath2=2.1212@xmath3 m ) and h@xmath5  ( @xmath6=21 s(1 ) ) ( 2.2471@xmath3 m ) rule out ultraviolet fluorescence as a significant mechanism in most seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "in all four of the galaxies discussed here , we have identified features in [ ]  and hydrogen recombination line profiles which we associate with outflows or other interactions with radio lobes and jets . except for ngc  2110 ,",
    "these features are weaker or invisible in the h@xmath5  line profile ; the kinematics of the h@xmath5  are usually better explained by galactic rotation . in addition , in those two galaxies where we have data perpendicular to the outflow axis ( mk  1066 and ngc  4388 ) , and possibly as well in ngc  2110 ( s99 ) , the h@xmath5  is significantly more extended than the atomic hydrogen recombination lines , with the h@xmath5/br@xmath4  flux ratio increasing by a factor of @xmath84 or more at 200300  pc away from the nucleus .    although x - ray heating of molecular clouds that cross into the ionization cones can give rise to the extended h@xmath5  emission along the cone axes , it is unlikely that the nucleus is responsible for the enhanced h@xmath5  emission along the axis perpendicular to the cones . according to the standard model of seyfert galaxies , the radiation from the central source",
    "is obscured except along the axis of the ionization cones ; thus , nuclear x - rays can not penetrate significantly into the gas perpendicular to the cone axis to produce the extended h@xmath5  emission .",
    "while these x - rays would heat the inner face of the obscuring molecular torus , the size of that torus is believed to be on the order of a few parsecs , so this can not explain the extended h@xmath5  emission that we observe .",
    "also , if molecular hydrogen emission does emerge from photodissociation regions heated by x - rays from a central source , we would expect strong br@xmath4  emission illuminated by ultraviolet radiation from the same central source .",
    "shocks driven directly or indirectly by the nucleus are another possible explanation for the excitation of the h@xmath5  emission .",
    "slow shocks moving through high density molecular clouds in the disk of the galaxy could excite molecular hydrogen emission . where the shocks encounter lower density clouds",
    ", they should be faster , and produce substantial [ ]  emission .",
    "the [ ] /pa@xmath1  ratio does rise with distance from the nucleus , at least initially , perpendicular to the primary direction of extended high - excitation gas in both mk  1066 and ngc  4388 . alternatively , secondary shocks in molecular clouds circumscribing radio outflows might give rise to enhanced h@xmath5  emission .",
    "this process might produce the differing [ ] and h@xmath5  spatial morphologies observed in ngc  1068 by @xcite .",
    "one problem with this scenario is that , in contrast to the axis of ioniziation cones where outflowing radio plasma may drive shocks into the surrounding gas , there is no obvious mechansim to drive shocks to distances of @xmath81  kpc perpendicular to the cone axis .",
    "the relatively large extent of the h@xmath5  emission perpendicular to the ionization cones in mk  1066 and ngc  4388 suggest that there are local source of heating which is giving rise to much of the h@xmath5  emission . in both galaxies",
    ", there may be contribution to the h@xmath5  emission from young stars heating molecular clouds .",
    "while this may contribute to the h@xmath5  emission , it is unlikely to be the only source , as the h@xmath5/br@xmath4  ratios observed in the extended h@xmath5  gas tend to be higher than the values @xmath88 typically observed in starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "ngc  4388 has a bar oriented at position angle @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "dynamical processes associated with this bar may be creating shocks which give rise to the observed h@xmath5  emission . in mk  1066 , it is also possible that the bulk motions of clouds which do not move completely with the rotation of the disk are colliding with other clouds , creating slow shocks which excite the cold molecular gas . in mk  3 , the lower h@xmath5/br@xmath4  ratio combined with the narrower h@xmath5  line profile suggest that local star formation activity may be able to explain most of the h@xmath5  emission , with no need for a contribution from outflowing gas associated with the nucleus . by contrast ,",
    "in ngc  2110 , where wings associated with the outflow are seen in h@xmath5 , nuclear x - ray heating may be a more significant contributor .",
    "1 .   we have observed strong infrared pa@xmath1 , br@xmath4 , [ ] , and h@xmath5  line emission which is spatially extended on scales of a few hundred parsecs in mk  1066 , ngc  2110 , ngc  4388 , and mk  3 . 2 .",
    "we have detected the near infrared coronal line [ ]  ( @xmath2=1.2525@xmath3 m ) in the nucleus of ngc  4388 . in contrast to the other infrared lines , this line is only marginally spatially extended .",
    "there is no apparent [ ] emission from mk  1066 , ngc  2110 , or mk  3 .",
    "this is similar to what is seen optically , that high ionization species are visible in some but not all seyfert galaxies . 3 .",
    "while often showing similar velocity trends over the central few arcseconds , the [ ] , h@xmath5 , and h lines have profiles which differ in detail from each other over the full spatial range probed by these observations .",
    "the peaks of lines are shifted relative to each other at some spatial positions in some galaxies , and some species show enhanced blue and red wings relative to other species .",
    "these differences are usually due to the effects of extinction , an enhancement to the [ ]  emission associated with other indicators of the action of an outflow , or a possible local source of heating of h@xmath5 .",
    "the [ ] /pa@xmath1  and h@xmath5/br@xmath4  flux ratios can vary dramatically on scales of 10@xmath116  pc near the nuclei of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the details of the spatial structure of the [ ] /pa@xmath1  ratio frequently support the notion that partially ionized regions created by x - ray photoionization from the nucleus , or shocks from the interaction of outflowing gas with ambient gas , or both , are enhancing the circumnuclear [ ]  emission .",
    "the spatial variation of the h@xmath5/br@xmath4  ratio is again frequently ascribable to local heating of h@xmath5 .",
    "5 .   the [ ]  emission appears to be associated with the nuclear activity , not requiring the invocation of a circumnuclear starburst in any of these four galaxies .",
    "the [ ]  can be kinematically and spatially linked to processes dominated by the active nucleus",
    ". in all of these galaxies , there are correlations between features in the [ ]  emission and both radio jets and optically identified outflows , suggesting that some [ ]  emission is produced by fast shocks resulting from interactions between radio jets and circumnuclear gas .",
    "the h@xmath5  emission , although peaked on the nucleus , is relatively strong compared to hydrogen recombination and [ ]  emission perpendicular to the axis of ionization cones or the major axis of high - excitation gas in mk  1066 and ngc  4388 .",
    "the spatial distribution and line profile of h@xmath5  generally differs from that of [ ] . a local source such as bar - driven shocks or circumnuclear star formation",
