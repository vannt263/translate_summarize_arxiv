    "resistance switching based memories , show the potential to be integrated into future micro - electronic components . such devices , consisting of oxide materials or solid electrolytes , present novel properties that allow for scalability down to the nano and even atomic scale , and very low power consumption .",
    "^@xcite^ + with this increased interest in memory resistive devices , there is a necessity to understand the physical mechanisms driving the resistance switching process .",
    "various models have been proposed to explain the switching mechanism , many of these models in agreement with the conductive filament formation , and annihilation , inside the insulator material.^@xcite^ nevertheless , a deep understanding of the microscopic mechanism responsible for filament formation is still lacking .",
    "+ in this paper we demonstrate the use of the hebb - wagner formalism ^@xcite^ for the analysis of the steady state i - v characteristics of memory resistors based upon mixed ion and electron conductors .",
    "we apply this formalism to fit our experimental i - v characteristics , and describe the ionic and electronic transport within the electrolyte before the full resistance switching is observed .",
    "+ the mixed conductor used for the present study is ag@xmath0s .",
    "however , this description could also be valid for other mixed electronic and ionic conductors , e.g. cu@xmath0s and aggese .",
    "in general , one has to take into account that the formation of a space charge layer occurs for many solid electrolytes . in the case of ag@xmath0s , effects due to depletion or space charge at the pt contact are negligible .",
    "the device we consider consists of a ag@xmath0s thin film contacted by a ag thin film at the bottom ( which helps to achieve a reference state with constant silver concentration at that contact ) , and a nano - scale pt contact on the top realized by means of a conductive afm tip .",
    "+ our measurements and simulations at low bias voltages ( steady state ) confirm the predictions of the theory : the increase in the electronic current at forward bias ( negative polarity at the pt contact ) is due to the initial accumulation of ag@xmath7-ions towards the nano - scale contact .",
    "this causes a ag concentration gradient , i.e. local deviations from the ideal stoichiometry in the region close to the nano - contact .",
    "we note that this occurs before reduction of the ag@xmath7-ions and therefore before any switching is observed .",
    "+ the hebb - wagner concepts have originally been formulated for bulk materials , and until today , to our knowledge , have not been applied to nano - scale contacts or thin film devices .",
    "we demonstrate that the theory still holds for nano - scale devices .",
    "by confirming this , we can achieve a better understanding of the conditions of ionic and electronic transport in mixed conductors and solid electrolytes which lead to conductance switching .",
    "the electrical measurements were performed with the use of a conductive atomic force microscope ( c - afm ) ( veeco multimode afm / spm system ) . in the setup ,",
    "the ag layer is the bottom contact to the ag@xmath0s layer and the top contact is a pt - coated afm tip .",
    "see the diagram in figure [ tip ] .",
    "+        platinum is a chemically inert metal , and as an electrode in the system it blocks the ionic current . by using a nano - scale pt electrode and a reference ( ag ) electrode at the bottom with a large surface area",
    ", the changes in electrical conductivity will be concentrated at the vicinity of the nano - contact .",
    "+ the current - voltage characteristics of the samples were obtained by continuously ramping the voltage linearly from 0 to @xmath8 down to @xmath9 and back to 0 , at a frequency of 0.25 hz .",
    "voltages are given throughout with respect to the potential of the pt tip ( taken as 0v ) .",
    "for the steady state analysis , the value of @xmath8 was kept below the potential at which we observed hysteresis in the i - v characteristics,^@xcite^ meaning that no significant changes are induced in the solid electrolyte by decomposition of the ag@xmath0s.^@xcite^ all the experiments were performed at ambient conditions .",
    "+ the current - voltage characteristics show an exponential behavior that is fully reversible on the time scale of the experiment .",
    "the curve is asymmetric , with an increase in the current at the positive bias .",
    "we refer to this as the pre - switching steady state behavior and , in the ag / ag@xmath10s / pt junctions , it is observed for voltages below about 75mv ( left panel figure [ ivs ] ) . when increasing the bias voltage beyond 75 mv , the i - v curves present hysteresis , which evolves into full bipolar switching for still larger voltages ( right panel figure [ ivs ] ) . in the full bipolar switching case ,",
    "the on and off states of the device are clearly observed , with a resistance ratio ( r@xmath11/r@xmath12 ) of approximately 10@xmath13 .",
    "+    s / pt(nano - contact ) system , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] s / pt(nano - contact ) system , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    for the purpose of this paper , we focus on the exponential , or steady - state , i - v curves ( left panel of figure [ ivs ] ) . the shape of the curve is reminiscent of curves measured for metal - semiconductor junctions , and it is known that ag@xmath10s is a n - type semiconductor.^@xcite^ however , the obtained curves have the inverse curvature as compared to that expected for a pt / n - type semiconductor junction ( i.e. schottky contact ) . in the case of solid electrolyte semiconductors ,",
    "this must be attributed to a combination of ionic and electronic conduction in the electrolyte .",
    "the main observation is the fact that the shape of the iv - curves depends strongly on the type of electrode use : material , size and symmetry of the electrodes.^@xcite^ + in our experiment , with the use of a nano - scale contact and a much larger bottom contact , we have introduced an asymmetry in the potential distribution across the mixed conductor .",
    "when a potential difference is applied to the system ag / ag@xmath10s / pt , where pt is the nano - contact , the strength of the electric field is concentrated in the vicinity of the nano - contact . if the potential is small , such as to avoid decomposition of ag@xmath10s , a steady state composition gradient is induced in the ag@xmath10s film , as a result of the mobility of ag@xmath14-ions.^@xcite^ + for a mixed electronic and ionic conductor such as ag@xmath10s , the electronic conductivity is a function of the deviations from the stoichiometric composition ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "when the negative polarity is at the pt tip ( nano - contact ) , the ag@xmath14-ions move towards the tip , acting as n - type donors .",
    "the local enhancement of the ag ion concentration results in an increase of the electronic conductivity in the small region close to the tip .",
    "we will elaborate on this below .",
    "+      a model for the current - voltage behavior of mixed ionic conductors under steady state conditions goes back to hebb and wagner.^@xcite^ + silver sulfide is a mixed conductor as both silver ions and electrons are mobile . applying a voltage @xmath16 to a silver sulfide sample between two electrodes , sets up a difference of the fermi levels , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , between both contacts .",
    "+ if we can neglect the interface resistances , the applied electrical potential difference @xmath16 imposes a difference of the local electrochemical potentials of electrons in the ionic conductor between the two electrode interfaces on the mixed conductor    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the electron charge .",
    "the values at the boundaries are denoted as , prime for the ag bottom contact and double prime for the pt nanocontact .",
    "+ according to eq.([eq1 ] ) , applying a voltage generates a gradient of the electrochemical potential @xmath21 within the mixed conducting silver compound and , thus , an electronic current density @xmath22 given by    @xmath23    with @xmath24 as the conductivity of electrons . + a gradient of the electrochemical potential of electrons is accompanied by a gradient of the electrochemical potential of silver ions , and vice versa .",
    "the corresponding silver ion current density is given by a complementary expression to eq.([xje ] ) according to    @xmath25    with @xmath26 as the conductivity of silver ions .",
    "+ furthermore , the currents of electrons and silver ions will be coupled by the equilibrium of electrons and ions according to    @xmath27    the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium between silver ions and electrons is valid , if the electrochemical potential gradient in eq.([xje ] ) is not too high.^@xcite^ this approach is well accepted for mixed conducting silver chalcogenides.^@xcite^ then , the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium holds for eq.([equil ] ) at all positions in the sample . with @xmath28 denoting the chemical potential of neutral silver , it follows    @xmath29    according to the local equilibrium condition ( [ chem - pot ] ) , the boundary condition eq.([eq1 ] ) , imposed by the voltage applied between the ion blocking pt nano - contact and the silver back contact leads also to the following alternative expression for the applied voltage    @xmath30    let us consider two simple limiting cases which lead to simplified equations for the voltage .",
    "the first concerns a sample with a homogeneous composition initially . at @xmath31 , just after a sudden jump of the voltage from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , the chemical potential of neutral silver has a constant value throughout the whole sample . under this condition , the difference of the chemical potentials of silver in eq.([eq6 ] ) vanishes and accordingly , the remaining difference of the electrochemical potentials of silver ions in eq.([eq6 ] ) will be identical to the difference of the electrochemical potentials of electrons in magnitude but opposite in sign .",
    "@xmath34    for increasing times @xmath35 , the initial silver ion current builds up a concentration gradient in the sample .",
    "this leads to an increasing value of the chemical potential difference @xmath36 and a decreasing electrochemical potential difference of silver ions which finally reaches zero .",
    "accordingly , the electrochemical potential difference of silver ions , and hence the ionic current , will vanish for long enough times @xmath37 giving    @xmath38    the metallic silver bottom electrode fixes the chemical potential at the interface ag / ag@xmath0s at @xmath39 . because of this , the chemical potential of silver ( and accordingly the non - stoichiometry @xmath15 ) at the ion - blocking electrode , is the only variable in the system which is linearly dependent on the applied voltage .",
    "therefore , under steady state conditions , eq.([eq7 ] ) simplifies to    @xmath40    note in this case that for @xmath41 , the chemical potential of silver at the ion - blocking contact is equivalent to that of metallic silver .",
    "therefore , if no supersaturation occurs , any positive voltage should lead to the formation of metallic silver deposits .",
    "however , this is not observed for positive voltages up to 75 mv meaning that around the ion - blocking contact , a supersaturated composition occurs with @xmath42 where @xmath43 corresponds to the non - stoichiometry in thermodynamic equilibrium with silver metal .",
    "+ hence , in the steady state , the gradient of the electrochemical potential of silver ions and the ionic current density vanish .",
    "then , the gradient of the electrochemical potential of electrons is equivalent to the gradient of the chemical potential of silver , and the total electric current density @xmath44 is carried by the electrons only .",
    "this is summarized in the following ,    @xmath45    therefore , in the steady state , the electronic current can be expressed by the gradient of the chemical potential of neutral silver according to    @xmath46    the typical time to reach the steady state as assumed for eqs.([eq10 ] ) to ( [ eq12 ] ) is estimated as @xmath47 = @xmath48/2 @xmath49 , with @xmath47 denoting the relaxation time for building up a steady - state silver concentration gradient in the sample , @xmath50 the diffusion length through the sample ( for a linear geometry the distance between the two electrodes ) , and @xmath49 the chemical diffusion coefficient of silver that is given by ^@xcite^    @xmath51    with c@xmath52 denoting the local concentration of ag atoms in ag@xmath10s .",
    "+ all quantities on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) are available from the literature.^@xcite^ the chemical diffusion coefficient in the low temperature phase of ag@xmath10s is very high , at 80@xmath53c the value is of the order of 10@xmath54 @xmath55/s . at ambient conditions , it is still around 10@xmath56 @xmath55/s . therefore , decay of concentration gradients in ag@xmath10s occurs much faster than in many other mixed conducting solids .",
    "the reason is that the thermodynamic factor @xmath57 in eq.([diff ] ) has an extremely large value due to the small range of non - stoichiometry.^@xcite^ + it has to be remarked that the relations discussed above are only valid as long as no deposition of metallic silver occurs . if silver metal is formed near and at the ion - blocking contact , the ion - blocking boundary condition is no more valid and a continuous silver ion current will flow .",
    "the total current then is a sum of electronic and ionic currents and will not reach a steady state . at a nano - contact , it will usually increase , because the formation of metallic silver will virtually increase the contact area of the nano - contact . finally , one expects a short - circuiting of the electrodes by the grown silver filaments .",
    "+ when the steady - state conditions with no silver deposition are fulfilled , eq.([eq12 ] ) can be applied and a well defined , unambiguous relation exists between the electronic conductivity and the chemical potential of silver . following a concept by c. wagner,^@xcite^ one can calculate the electronic conductivity from the slope of the steady state i - v curve .",
    "first , the chemical potential and the space variable are separated according to    @xmath58    the relation is given for a general case where the current density may vary along the coordinates @xmath59 .",
    "integrating eq.([eq13 ] ) , with integration limits set by the boundary conditions at the two electrode contacts , we have    @xmath60    the left - hand side of eq.([eq14 ] ) depends on the geometry of the contacts .",
    "we will simplify the integrals by assuming the chemical potential drops only along one coordinate , say @xmath61 .",
    "the integral becomes simple for a sharp point contact ( radius a ) and a hemispherical reference electrode at @xmath62 . in this case",
    "we have ,    @xmath63    more generally we obtain an expression with the total electrical current i and a constant @xmath64 that depends on the distribution of the current density through the sample :    @xmath65    with k = a / l for a specimen in the shape of a pellet with area a and thickness l , k = 2@xmath66a for a hemispherical contact of radius a , and k = 4a for a disk shaped contact to a semi - infinite sample .",
    "+ with this result for the left hand side of eq.([eq14 ] ) , following c. wagner ^@xcite^ one can differentiate both sides with respect to the upper integration boundary @xmath67 .",
    "this yields    @xmath68    from eq.([eq10 ] ) we have @xmath69 , accordingly @xmath70 and    @xmath71    now that we have eliminated the unknown chemical potential we can integrate again over the electrical potential to obtain the final current - voltage relation in the steady state    @xmath72    in our case , we are working in the range of stoichiometry @xmath15 @xmath73 0 , i.e. the n - type range . under this assumption the electronic conductivity is given by @xmath74.^@xcite^ the voltage dependence arises from the relation between the local ag@xmath14-ion concentration ( doping ) and the local electrical potential .",
    "+ thus , we obtain    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath64 is a constant representing the geometrical factor mentioned in eq.([eq15 ] ) . in the limit near zero bias ,",
    "i.e. ev @xmath77 kt , eq.([i(v ) ] ) reduces to @xmath78 .",
    "+ as indicated in eq.([eq10 ] ) , the relation above applies only in the cases when one of the electrodes maintains a constant chemical potential for ag , and all changes occur at the small electrode . in other experiments,^@xcite^ by using two pt electrodes with the same asymmetry in the geometry , we observed a slight deviation from the theory due to additional chemical potential changes at the pt bottom contact . from a thermodynamic point of view , in principle i - v relations could also be calculated , if one knows the initial non - stoichiometry @xmath15 of the sample .",
    "but as they depend on the initial @xmath15 , it is not easy to achieve well defined experimental conditions .",
    "+ in order to approach the limit of the semi - infinite sample ( no changes at the bottom electrode ) we need to make use of a very small contact .",
    "this allow us also to test the theory for nanometer size limit .",
    "figure [ iv - fit ] shows two sets of data for a 200 nm thick ag@xmath0s film on top of a ag bottom reference electrode ( black lines ) .",

    "we have modeled the sample and electrodes geometry ( figure [ sigma_simu ] ) .",
    "the resulting total current as a function of the applied voltage ( same as used for the measured iv s ) results in a iv curve reproducing those obtained from the experiment and fitting .",

    "the quality of the fit is much less good than in the case of the nano - contact .",
    "this , is because the assumption of a semi - infinite sample is not longer valid . in our case , fitting with eq.([i(v ) ] ) led to a calculated effective contact radius of 17 @xmath82 m .",

    "the figure clearly shows that the conductivity changes are concentrated in the region close to the top electrode .",
    "also , we observed that the conductivity increases when the negative polarity is at the top electrode , indicating a local increase of ag@xmath14-ion concentration ( n - type donors ) . in the opposite polarity",
