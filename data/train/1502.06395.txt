    "the observation of an anomalous paramagnetic magnetization signal ( viz . , paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) ) , instead of the usual diamagnetic behaviour , on field - cooling a superconducting specimen , continues to attract @xcite attention ever since its discovery @xcite in ceramic sample(s ) of a high @xmath0 cuprate .",
    "in addition to high @xmath0 cuprates @xcite , the pme - like attribute is known to occur in a wide variety of other superconductors @xcite .",
    "numerous explanations ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) , e.g. , the d - wave superconductivity @xcite , orbital glass @xcite , presence of @xmath5 contacts leading to spontaneous currents @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , etc . , have been advanced as the origin of pme like signal(s ) in high @xmath0 superconductors . a model proposed by koshelev and",
    "larkin @xcite envisaged the possibility of trapping of magnetic flux in the interior of a superconducting sample due to inhomogeneous cooling .",
    "in such a circumstance , the pme can occur due to unbalancing between two oppositely directed currents , viz .",
    ", ( i ) a ( paramagnetic ) current set up in the interior that attempts to screen the effect of trapped flux and , ( ii ) a usual ( diamagnetic ) current flowing on the surface that shields the external field @xcite . however , within the ginzburg - landau framework , the theoretical works by moshchalkov _ et _",
    "_ @xcite and zharkov @xcite , for model cases of mesoscopic cylindrical shaped superconductors , lead to the proposition that the multi - quanta vortex matter , i.e. , vortices with multiple flux quanta , @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 , nucleating below a third critical field ( @xmath6 ) , at the onset of surface superconductivity @xcite can also give rise to the pme .",
    "recently , a controlled switching of the pme into the usual ( diamagnetic ) meissner effect has been vividly demonstrated by xing _",
    "@xcite in a superconducting ferromagnet pb - co nanocomposite , wherein the source of pme is argued to be related to some different mechanism other than those stated above .",
    "this manipulation of pme is possible by the change in orientation of magnetic moments of co nanoparticles with respect to the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "such a tuning of the anomalous pme and the non - anomalous ( diamagnetic ) meissner effect has rarely been reported in the literature . as another case of manipulating a pme like response",
    ", we have explored some novel facets of the pme in a single crystal of 2h - nbse@xmath1 @xcite , an example of a conventional low @xmath0 superconducting system often studied to explore novel notions in vortex matter .",
    "the results being reported ahead in 2h - nbse@xmath1 present an advancement over studies earlier reported by some of us in ca@xmath7rh@xmath8sn@xmath9 @xcite and nb @xcite .",
    "the curious behaviour pertains to an unusual paramagnetic magnetization ( _ a la _ pme ) and its manipulation just below @xmath0 in the ( isofield ) temperature - dependent dc magnetization ( @xmath10 ) data .",
    "we find that in a short window of temperature , where the pme occurs below @xmath0 in 2h - nbse@xmath1 , an external perturbation can randomly change the magnetization from a given paramagnetic value to a larger or lesser paramagnetic value or from a given paramagnetic state to a diamagnetic one . across the same temperature interval",
    ", the system can also transit from a given diamagnetic state into a paramagnetic one after being perturbed by an ac field impulse .",
    "the vortex matter in the field - temperature domain of the pme in 2h - nbse@xmath1 is thus found to be highly metastable .",
    "the results in a bulk 2h - nbse@xmath1 specimen unexpectedly appear to echo the consequences of nucleation of several metastable multiple flux quanta states ( @xmath4 ) proposed in the context of mesoscopic samples @xcite .    ,",

    "panel ( b ) elucidates @xmath10 plots on the expanded scale in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "anomalous paramagnetic signals are evident in all three modes .",
    "the paramagnetic magnetization reaches its extreme limit at @xmath19 during the field - cooled cool - down run , @xmath20 . ]",
    "the single crystal of hexagonal 2h - nbse@xmath1 chosen for the present study is platelet - shaped with a planar area of 4.12mm@xmath21 , thickness of 0.17 mm and mass of 4.64 mg .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) for this crystal is measured to be about 7.15k .",
    "the crystallographic _ ab _ plane of the hexagonal 2h - nbse@xmath1 coincides with the plane of the platelet , while the direction normal to it corresponds to the crystallographic _",
    "c_-axis of 2h - nbse@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetization measurements were performed using a superconducting quantum interference device - vibrating sample magnetometer ( squid - vsm , quantum - design , inc . ,",
    "usa ) in such a way that the magnetic field was directed nominally parallel to the plane of the platelet ( i.e. , @xmath13||@xmath22 ) , with less than 5 degree error in the angle of alignment .",
    "an advantage of investigating the sample along this orientation is that the demagnetization factor is small ( @xmath23 ) and the associated geometrical / boundary effects are expected to be minimal .",
    "we estimated , using the flux gate option of the squid - vsm , the field - inhomogeneity of the superconducting magnet over a scan length of 8 mm .",
    "it is found to be only of the order @xmath24oe . during the magnetization measurements ,",
    "the amplitude of vibration of the sample was kept small ( @xmath25 mm ) in most of the runs ( unless specifically stated otherwise ) so that the possible artefact @xcite due to field inhomogeneity along the scan length of the superconducting sample in squid - vsm is so minuscule that it is of no significance .",
    "the effect of changing the amplitude of sample vibration on the magnetization value ( at a given @xmath13,@xmath26 value ) in the superconducting state of a standard indium sample has also been investigated .",
    "we registered no difference in the magnetization response of indium specimen in its superconducting state , when the amplitude of vibration in vsm measurements was changed from 0.5 to 8 mm .",
    "hence , under the normal circumstances , it can be stated that the change in amplitude of sample vibration ( upto a maximum of 8 mm in the present vsm instrument ) is not expected to alter the dc magnetization value of a superconducting sample at a given @xmath13 and @xmath26 . in the case of 2h - nbse@xmath1 crystal , we have observed a wide variation in ( isofield ) magnetization response , ranging from paramagnetic to diamagnetic values at different amplitudes ( see fig .",

    "1 were obtained .",
    "this curve will henceforth be called as pristine in the discussion ahead .",
    "we then recorded the @xmath20 data ( without changing the external field ) while cooling the sample down to ( near ) peak temperature ( @xmath19 ) of the pme , i.e. , @xmath50k , which is encircled in the main panel of fig .",

    "an examination of @xmath20 data recorded in the two runs , perturbed ( # 1 ) and perturbed ( # 2 ) , in fig .",
    "4(b ) shows a pronounced path - dependence in @xmath20 at temperatures above about @xmath60k .",
    "this suggests that the impact of an impulse above @xmath60k is completely unpredictable : the system can display any magnetization value ranging from paramagnetic to diamagnetic .",
    "the impulse seems to be acting as a drive which brings out transition from a given ( paramagnetic / diamagnetic ) state of the system into another and hence leads to a non - uniqueness in @xmath20 . on the other hand , the two @xmath20 runs ( perturbed ( # 1 ) and perturbed ( # 2 ) ) tend to overlap when an impulse was applied below about @xmath60k . below this temperature ,",
    "the two curves respond identically to any further impulse treatment and the magnetization values remain diamagnetic .     in pristine and perturbed cases at @xmath28oe . in perturbed ( # 1 ) , an impulse was first imposed at @xmath63k ( encircled ) , followed by another at @xmath33k , and at every @xmath37k difference below @xmath33k .",
    "saturated @xmath20 value of pristine and perturbed ( # 1 ) are much different . in contrast , the impulse applied at @xmath32k ( perturbed ( # 2 ) ) and at 3k ( perturbed ( # 3 ) ) brings out minimal changes .",

    "5 indicate the temperatures at which the impulse was applied .",
    "the first impulse applied at @xmath60k changes the magnetization from a diamagnetic value ( encircled ) of pristine @xmath20 to a larger diamagnetic value ( perturbed ( # 1 ) ) . after lowering the temperature to @xmath33k ,",

    "the commencement of application of an impulse at temperatures lower than @xmath32k resulted in a small change in the magnetization .",

    "it is a mere coincidence that the first magnetization data after the impulse treatment at @xmath56k in the case of perturbed ( # 2 ) falls on the warm - up curve of perturbed ( # 3 ) . taking cue from the observations made in fig .  3 , the magnetization after the impulse treatment at @xmath56k could have achieved any value ranging from paramagnetic to diamagnetic .",

    "along this line , it will now be interesting to investigate whether such a change can also be induced by an impulse in a @xmath20 response at higher amplitude , say 8 mm , which in pristine conditions remained entirely diamagnetic below @xmath0 ( in fig .",
    "7 ) . to demonstrate this",
    ", we applied an impulse on the pristine fc state created ( at 8 mm amplitude ) at @xmath81k in a field of @xmath28oe as shown in fig .",

    "8 the pristine @xmath20 curve at 0.5 mm amplitude as well .",
    "it is interesting to note that the diamagnetic value of the pristine @xmath20 curve for 8 mm amplitude changes to a paramagnetic value after the impulse treatment at @xmath81k .",
    "the @xmath20 curve after perturbation ( open triangles ) was traced and found to be following a different path as shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "the saturated value of this curve ( perturbed , 8 mm ) at @xmath48k approaches nearer to that of pristine @xmath20 curve at @xmath82 mm as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "similar investigations were carried out for the pristine @xmath78 curve at @xmath56 mm amplitude as shown in fig .",
    "here , we performed two different runs ( independently ) , after the impact of an impulse at @xmath81k . in one of the runs ( perturbed ( # 1 ) ) , a paramagnetic magnetization was induced at @xmath79k and the @xmath20 thereafter follows a certain path ( open triangles ) , which is similar to that seen for 8 mm amplitude in the perturbed state ( fig .",
    "8(a ) ) . during the other run ( perturbed ( # 2 ) )",
    ", we observed that the magnetization data changes from near zero value of the pristine @xmath11 for @xmath56 mm to a large diamagnetic value after the imposition of an impulse at @xmath79k , and follows a path shown by open squares in fig .",
    "we draw an important inference here that the occurrence of paramagnetic response is not specific to a given amplitude of sample vibration , as it can be unearthed via a perturbation at all amplitudes ranging from 0.5 mm to 8 mm .",
    "curve at @xmath83koe recorded at an amplitude of 0.5 mm showing some unusual undulations .",
    "the inset panel shows a dip ( see encircled portion ) in @xmath20 curve at @xmath28oe , just below the onset of the superconductivity during run with @xmath56 mm amplitude . ]",
    "we finally exemplify in the main panel of fig .",
    "9 an unusual feature , viz .",
    ", a characteristic oscillatory behaviour seen in @xmath20 response recorded at 0.5 mm amplitude in a higher field , @xmath83koe .",
    "this curve exhibits some peculiar undulations which override the paramagnetic magnetization signal below @xmath0 .",
    "it appears as if the magnetization shows a tendency to switch between the paramagnetic and diamagnetic responses while field - cooling .",
    "such undulations echo similar oscillatory features reported earlier at lower field values ( @xmath84oe ) in another low @xmath0 superconductor , viz .",
    ", ca@xmath7rh@xmath8sn@xmath9 by kulkarni _",
    "it may also be added here that the oscillatory behaviour in @xmath20 is not merely restricted to lower amplitudes and higher fields , but , the same were also discernible at higher amplitudes and lower fields in 2h - nbse@xmath1 . at 7 mm amplitude and in a field of @xmath28oe ,",
    "the @xmath20 response was observed to have an oscillatory character in close proximity of @xmath0 as can be seen in an expanded portion of the @xmath20 in an inset panel of fig .",
    "this curve first shows a pronounced dip ( encircled in the inset of fig .",
    "9 ) , which can be taken as the onset of diamagnetism . following this dip",
    ", there occurs a sharp upturn on further lowering of temperature .",
    "the @xmath20 values eventually cross over to negative values on lowering the temperature below @xmath85k .",
    "we have come across some amazing metastability effects in magnetization response on field - cooling a single - crystal of 2h - nbse@xmath1 , viz . ,",
    "occurrence of both paramagnetic and diamagnetic response in a temperature window just below @xmath0 , multi - valuedness in @xmath86 at a given ( @xmath13,@xmath26 ) value , oscillatory behaviour in a given @xmath86 curve , unpredictable switching of @xmath86 between diamagnetic and paramagnetic values due to an intervention by an external perturbation , etc . the mechanism and origin behind the said features in 2h - nbse@xmath1 can not be comprehended on the basis of existing theoretical treatments in the literature .",
    "the following descriptions form the basis of this assertion :    \\1 .",
    "the occurrence of ( anomalous ) paramagnetic magnetization in conventional bulk superconductors @xcite had lead to several proposals , amongst which the flux - trapping model by koshelev and larkin @xcite received significant attention .",
    "this model treats the situation wherein the magnetic flux gets trapped while field - cooling within a ( macroscopic or mesoscopic ) superconducting specimen due to an inhomogenous cooling @xcite . while a ( diamagnetic ) current flows on the surface to shield an external field , associated with the trapped flux inside the specimen , there occurs a ( paramagnetic ) current that circulates in the interior of a superconducting sample @xcite .",
    "paramagnetic magnetization response can result due to an unbalancing effect of magnetization responses arising from the above stated two currents .",
    "the inhomogeneity in field - cooling , can have a variety , which in turn , can lead to a variety in trapped flux , thereby , resulting in multitude of magnetization responses during field - cooling experiments . such a possibility could rationalize the observation of variety in @xmath86 response , as reflected in fig .  7 in the form of vibration amplitude - dependent @xmath86 data at a given field value . carrying this argument further , the data in fig .",
    "7 would imply that the inhomogeneity in cooling may be lesser at higher value of amplitude of vibration ( see @xmath86 curves at 7 mm and 8 mm amplitude in figs .",
    "7 and 8) , leading to insignificant flux trapping ( absence of paramagnetic signal ) .",
    "however , even in case of @xmath86 data recorded at higher amplitudes ( say 8 mm ) , that had remained entirely diamagnetic below @xmath0 , a diamagnetic @xmath86 value at a given temperature can be switched into a paramagnetic one , when the sample is perturbed by an impulse of an ac field ( cf .",
    "from the perspective of flux - trapping model @xcite , this would imply that the impulse treatment can drive the system from a state of insignificant trapped - flux ( diamagnetic ) to a state of large trapped - flux ( paramagnetic ) , which sounds to be unfeasible .",
    "along similar lines , it can be argued that the occurrence of a diamagnetic dip just below @xmath0 ( insignificant trapped - flux ) followed by a paramagnetic peak ( large trapped - flux ) in @xmath86 ( cf .",
    "9 ) can not be rationalized by this model .",
    "also , the switching tendency of magnetization between diamagnetic and paramagnetic values identified via the characteristics undulations ( oscillatory behaviour ) in a given @xmath86 run ( fig .  9 ) needs comprehension which is beyond the scope of flux - trapping model .",
    "we further noted two different effects of an impulse in two independent runs on the @xmath86 response obtained at a higher amplitude of 7 mm ( fig .",
    "8(b ) ) . in one of the instances ( perturbed ( # 1 ) )",
    ", the impulse switches a diamagnetic ( pristine ) @xmath86 value into a paramagnetic one while in the other ( independent ) run ( # 2 ) , it switches the same diamagnetic @xmath86 value into a larger diamagnetic value .",
    "clearly , this suggests that the effects of an impulse in the present study are completely _ random , _ whereas the koshelev and larkins mathematical treatment @xcite to a given field and current distribution due to a trapped flux ought to be _",
    "we therefore rule out that this model can explain the metastability observed in @xmath86 response of 2h - nbse@xmath1 .",
    "\\2 . to understand the thermomagnetic history dependence observed in the magnetization data of a type - ii superconductor , clem and",
    "hao @xcite had constructed a model which relies on the beans critical state framework @xcite . although this model @xcite yields the flux - density profiles that can get set up in a superconductor during different protocols usually studied by experimentalists , viz .",
    ", zero field - cooled , field - cooled cool - down and field - cooled warm - up modes , it can not account for paramagnetic magnetization in the superconducting specimen .",
    "however , we noted that the effect of an impulse applied below @xmath63k does not lead to any paramagnetic magnetization but an enhanced diamagnetism ( cf .",
    "the multi - valuedeness in ( diamagnetic ) @xmath86 data at low temperatures ( @xmath87k , cf .",
    "inset panel of fig .  3 , 4(a ) and 7 and 8(a ) and fig .",
    "5 ) can be related in an oblique way to a result that emanated using the model of clem and hao @xcite .",
    "we recall that the flux expulsion by a pinned - superconductor when it is field - cooled through its @xmath0 is never complete @xcite and therefore the field - cooled magnetization generally does not conform to an equilibrium magnetization .",
    "the model by clem and hao @xcite indeed shows that the @xmath86 curve at a constant field depends on the pinning strength ; a more ( less ) diamagnetic state amounts to less ( more ) strongly pinned vortex configuration ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "we observe a diversity in @xmath86 data ( see , for example , inset of fig .",
    "3 ) that closely resembles the pinning - dependent ( multi - valued ) @xmath86 curves numerically calculated by clem and hao ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , the multiplicity seen in present case is in the same 2h - nbse@xmath1 crystal , i.e. , without changing the amount of quenched - disorder ( pinning strength ) . comparing the two pictures , viz . , the @xmath86 response of 2h - nbse@xmath1 ( an inset of fig .",
    "3 ) and that shown in fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , one may naively surmise that the non - uniqueness in @xmath86 in 2h - nbse@xmath1 could be due to the possibility of coexistence of several ( metastable ) vortex configurations with varying pinning strength .",
    "the impulse treatment or amplitude - variation can lead to the switching of the system from one configuration to another , which is reflected by the diversity in @xmath86 as shown in inset panels of figs .  3 and 7 .",
    "in a given field - cooled run , the @xmath86 values get saturated below a certain temperature , @xmath88 , at which the applied field just equals the lower critical field ( @xmath89 ) . below @xmath88 ,",
    "i.e. , in the meissner phase , the applied field remains smaller than the @xmath89 value and the application of an ac field impulse ( @xmath90 ) superimposed on the ( static ) applied field ( @xmath91 ) is hardly expected to produce any significant change in @xmath86 .",
    "this is apparent from the minimal changes seen in @xmath86 below @xmath92k for the perturbed cases ( # 2 ) , ( # 3 ) and ( # 4 ) in fig .",
    "2h - nbse@xmath1 system has for long remained a favourite compound to explore novel notions in vortex state studies .",
    "in particular , this compound has been very widely investigated ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) for order - disorder transitions as fingerprinted via anomalous variations in field / temperature dependencies in critical current density , viz . ,",
    "peak effect ( pe ) phenomenon / second magnetization peak ( smp ) anomaly in magnetization hysteresis loops . due to supercooling",
    "/ superheating effects @xcite that can occur across these transitions , the magnetization response is generally found to be history - dependent @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize here that the present results pertaining to metastability effects in 2h - nbse@xmath1 have no correlations with the metastability and thermomagnetic history - dependence in critical current density values seen across the pe / smp transitions .",
    "firstly , most of the magnetization data presented here have been recorded at very low fields ( i.e. , @xmath28oe ) .",
    "we have checked that at this field value , the present crystal does not display either pe in temperature - dependent isofield scans or smp transition in isothermal scans at any temperature .",
    "secondly , the history - dependent magnetization across the pe / smp has never been reported to generate paramagnetic magnetization .",
    "clearly , all the novel proposals @xcite that have been put forward to understand the origin of paramagnetic magnetization in high-@xmath0 superconductors are very difficult to visualize in the present context which involves a conventional low-@xmath0 superconductor .",
    "even the controlled manipulation of paramagnetic magnetization demonstrated recently @xcite in pb - co nanocomposites involved the change in the orientation of magnetic moments of co nanoparticles unlike the present situation wherein we have observed in a non magnetic superconductor , 2h - nbse@xmath1 , an unpredictable switching of paramagnetic magnetization into diamagnetic and vice versa .",
    "we rule out that the present results are a consequence of any specific disorder present in the anisotropic 2h - nbse@xmath1 crystal as there have been few other reports of similar metastability effects ( including oscillatory magnetization behaviour ) in other isotropic low-@xmath0 superconductors , viz . , single - crystals of ca@xmath7rh@xmath8sn@xmath9 @xcite and nb ( in the form of a sphere ) @xcite .",
    "an advantage with a spherical ( nb ) crystal @xcite is that the demagnetization factor remains the same irrespective of the sample orientation with respect to field and , hence , yields identical results in all orientations . in these studies @xcite , however , the effects of perturbation on @xmath86 response were not explored .",
    "the novel consequences of perturbation on the @xmath86 response in the present study have lead to exposure of a rich multiplicity in _ fc _ magnetization and random switching tendency of @xmath86 between paramagnetic and diamagnetic values , which is indeed an advancement over the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now focus our attention onto some theoretical works @xcite which attempt to account for the occurrence of pme in mesoscopic - sized samples . based on the ginzburg - landau theory ,",
    "the theoretical pictures framed exclusively for mesoscopic superconductors foresee the occurrence of giant vortex states with multiple flux quanta ( @xmath4 ) at the onset of surface superconductivity @xcite .",
    "each multi - quantum state has its own field domain of existence ; at higher field end of each domain , the response is diamagnetic , which crosses over to the paramagnetic values as the field decreases ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , figs .",
    "16 , 17 and 23 in ref .",
    "it is also possible that the temperature ( or field ) sweeping in a given @xmath10 ( or @xmath93@xmath13 ) run is sufficient enough to drive the system away from the field / temperature domain of a certain configuration ( @xmath94 ) , which may induce a forced transition @xcite to the nearest minimum energy configuration ( with different @xmath94 value ) .",
    "an examination of the @xmath93@xmath13 plots for different multi - quanta states ( @xmath4 ) along with the corresponding free energy vs field curves drawn for a specific circumstance in figs .  2 and 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite tells us that if the transitions occur between @xmath94 states such that the configuration pertaining to a certain @xmath94 value with the lowest free energy prevails , there would be no metastability effects in the magnetization response and the magnetization values as a function of temperature ( in isofield scans ) would be diamagnetic all through .",
    "however , if metastability is permissible and transitions happen between different metastable @xmath94 states , one can encounter all sorts of possibilities , i.e. , the magnetization values can change from a given paramagnetic / diamagnetic value to a higher or a lower value , and it can also transit from positive to negative values or vice versa .    to our knowledge , the above mentioned ( and other related ) studies @xcite describing the magnetization behaviour of multi - quanta states ( @xmath4 ) in mesoscopic samples are the only examples which bear some resemblance with our findings .",
    "we draw here some parallels between these theoretical findings @xcite and our experimental results in a single crystal of 2h - nbse@xmath1 , to which the latter results @xcite prima facie do not apply .",
    "as mentioned above , each multi - quantum state ( @xmath4 ) has a certain domain of its existence wherein the magnetization response can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic depending upon the external field @xcite .",
    "similarly , in 2h - nbse@xmath1 , there exists a temperature window ( @xmath60k@xmath18 ) , where a perturbation applied to the system ( at a given ( @xmath13,@xmath26 ) value ) can randomly yield the magnetization which is either paramagnetic or diamagnetic ( see figs .  3 , 4(b ) , 6 and 8) .",
    "the switching of @xmath86 due to a perturbation leads to a rich diversity in magnetization response in 2h - nbse@xmath1 ( cf . figs .",
    "3 to 6 and 8) , very similar to characteristics of magnetization behaviour anticipated during the transformation amongst various multi - quanta ( @xmath4 ) states @xcite .",
    "additionally , the oscillatory behavior seen in @xmath86 curve ( fig .  9 ) mimics the magnetization response predicted @xcite for the transformations amongst multi - quanta states ( @xmath4 ) during the temperature - sweep . in an earlier unrelated study , the scanning tunneling microscopy technique employed by karapetrov _",
    "@xcite , enabled them to directly observe a coexistence of multi - quanta vortex states and abrikosov lattice in an array of submicroscopic metal ( gold ) island embedded in a single crystal of 2h - nbse@xmath1 .",
    "the simultaneous existence of multi - quanta state of different vorticities is thus not an unrealistic possibility .    _ in spite of a strong resemblance of our results with the characteristics of multi - quanta states _",
    "@xcite _ _ , the possibility of occurrence of multi - quanta states in the sample investigated here remains a speculation considering the larger size of this ( macroscopic ) sample .",
    "the effect of multi - vorticity in such a macroscopic sample is an exotic proposition .",
    "therefore , there is currently a necessity to look for a more sophisticated model to fully understand the new findings in 2h - nbse@xmath1 as well as earlier results in ca@xmath7rh@xmath8sn@xmath9 @xcite and nb @xcite .",
    "_ _    in the end , we rule out the possibility of any experimental artefact arising due to change in amplitude of vibration considering the following important points : ( i ) the factor which could be affected most by changing the sample vibration is the magnetic field - inhomogeneity which , in the present case , is found to be negligible ( @xmath95oe ) . ( ii ) we did not register any change in the magnetization on varying the amplitude at a given ( @xmath13,@xmath26 ) value in the case of a standard indium sample .",
    "( iii ) we have also shown that the pme like attribute in 2h - nbse@xmath1 is not limited to only smaller amplitudes but the same can also be induced at higher amplitudes ( 8 mm ) , after the impulse treatment .",
    "we have investigated in detail a single crystal specimen of 2h - nbse@xmath1 via dc magnetization measurements . the new revelations in this compound correspond to the observation of an anomalous paramagnetic ( pme like ) signal(s ) below @xmath0 and some peculiar consequences of applying a perturbation at various temperatures on a given field - cooled state .",
    "based on the effects of perturbation , two distinct temperature intervals have been identified . across a certain temperature range lying just below @xmath0 , the pme - like signal can be manipulated by applying an external perturbation , which unpredictably switches the @xmath86 response from a given para / diamagnetic value into a different para / diamagnetic value . on the other hand , when the system is perturbed away from @xmath0 ( below about @xmath63k ) , the effect of perturbation is of one kind , i.e. , it only enhances the diamagnetism such that no paramagnetic signal is seen . the saturated ( diamagnetic ) @xmath86 value at the lowest temperature is found to be influenced by the effect of perturbation applied closer to the region of pme .",
    "the said features in @xmath86 data in a single crystal of 2h - nbse@xmath1 coincidentally bear similarities with the magnetization response predicted @xcite for mesoscopic samples , wherein , a possibility of nucleation of multi - quanta states ( @xmath4 ) have been discussed in the literature .",
    "we believe the present results in a bulk 2h - nbse@xmath1 crystal can not be explained by any of the existing mathematical treatments based on prescriptions of bean s critical state model @xcite reported in the literature and call for a new theoretical framework .",
    "though , we have presented experimental results pertaining to a given orientation of magnetic field vis .",
    "crystallographic direction ( @xmath13||@xmath22 ) of hexagonal 2h - nbse@xmath1 , we have also carried out magnetization measurements in more often studied orientation , viz .",
    ", @xmath13||@xmath96 , in 2h - nbse@xmath1 and obtained nearly identical features ( data not included in the present report ) .",
    "we may therefore state that assertions made in this report are not specific to the anisotropic nature of the intrinsic superconducting parameters of 2h - nbse@xmath1 .",
