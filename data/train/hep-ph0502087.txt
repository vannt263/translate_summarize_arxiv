    "although the electroweak standard model ( sm ) @xcite has been experimentally tested with excellent results , the scalar sector of the model responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking remains without any experimental test ; thus the big mismatch of the sm is the absence of the higgs boson . a wide variety of models",
    "have been introduced to address the puzzles of the the electroweak symmetry breaking and the hierarchy mass problem .",
    "for instance supersymmetry@xcite , large extra - dimensions@xcite , strong dynamics leading to a composite higgs boson@xcite and little higgs models@xcite .",
    "there are many other problems that are not addressed by the sm and suggest new physics beyond the sm ; one of them is the mixing between families , which is related with the neutrino oscillation and the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes@xcite .",
    "one simple extension of the sm is the so called two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) which add a new higgs boson doublet with the same quantum numbers as the fist one , and in this way allow a new rich variety of phenomenology . in one attempt to solve the hierarchy problem for",
    "the quarks in the third family , one kind of these 2hdms give masses to the up sector with one higgs doublet and to the down sector with the other one .",
    "this model is the so - called 2hdm type ii , and precisely it is the one that appear in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite .",
    "the fcnc processes can be avoided at tree level in the 2hdm by imposing discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "this symmetry leads to 2hdm type i or ii .",
    "however , our study is going to focus on the 2hdm type iii without any discrete symmetry , the most general version of the 2hdm , in which the fcnc processes appear at tree level in the yukawa couplings .",
    "from the experimental data at lep collider has been found the bound @xmath4 gev , through direct search of the higgs boson@xcite ; on the other hand , radiative corrections of the electroweak parameters lead to a light higgs boson in the sm scenario with mass below 220 gev@xcite .",
    "otherwise , tev scale is being tested by the fermilab tevatron and will soon be explored at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "if the higgs boson is sm like its discovery is guaranteed at the lhc ; its mass will be measured with high precision and in some channels , the signals will be enough to allow the knowledge of certain combinations of higgs partial widths up to @xmath5 level @xcite .",
    "further , the linear @xmath6 collider will study the dynamics of the new physics with high precision@xcite ; it will measure the production cross section of a light higgs boson in higgsstrahlung or @xmath7 fusion as well as the important branching fractions with a few percent level .",
    "it is a challenge the discovery of the higgs boson ; but an important issue is to decide what kind of model it is coming from , which can be elucidated through its coupling with standard particles . in the standard model",
    "their couplings are always proportional to the particle masses .",
    "other models have deviations @xcite or they are suppressed like 2hdm by a mixing angle .",
    "a photon collider offers excellent opportunities to probe these couplings .",
    "it can be built from @xmath6 or @xmath8 scattering using compton backscattering of lasers from @xmath9 beams , and it can measure rates for higgs production and decays into certain final states with few percent level precision .",
    "experimental studies have been done for various photon colliders designs ( tesla , nlc , clic , jlc ) of the expected precisions with which the rates @xmath10 can be measured .",
    "the results show that @xmath11 could be measured at about @xmath12 level for a light higgs boson , and the channels @xmath13 at @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath16 @xcite .    in this work we focus on the lightest cp - even higgs boson @xmath1 in the 2hdm - iii , its partial decays widths at tree level and one - loop level taking into account the contribution of new physics due to fcnc from the yukawa couplings .",
    "we calculate the number of events of the @xmath1 boson as a resonance in a photon collider taking into account its associated background signal .",
    "the 2hdm includes a second higgs doublet , and both doublets acquire vacuum expectation value ( vev ) different from zero , given by @xmath17 the mass eigenstates have a scalar spectrum which contains two @xmath0-even neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath1 , @xmath18 ) coming from the mixing of @xmath19 with mixing angle @xmath20 ; two charged higgs bosons ( @xmath21 ) which it is a mix of the would - be goldstone bosons @xmath22 through the mixing angle @xmath23 ; and one @xmath0-odd higgs ( @xmath24 ) which is a mixing of the neutral would - be goldstone boson @xmath25 . in the general 2hdm - iii",
    "the higgs doublets can couple with the up and down quark sector at the same time because there is not a discrete symmetry and fcnc appears at tree level .",
    "then the yukawa lagrangian for the quarks in this model can be written as follow @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the higgs doublets , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are non - diagonal @xmath30 matrices and the suffix `` 0 '' means that these fermion states are not mass eigenstates . from equation",
    "( 2 ) it is clear that the mass terms for the up - type or down - type sectors will depend on two yukawa coupling matrices .",
    "the rotation of the quarks and leptons allow us to diagonalize one of the matrices but in general not both simultaneously , then one yukawa coupling remains non - diagonal , leading to the fcnc at tree level .    in 2hdm - iii",
    "there is a global symmetry which can make a rotation of the higgs doublets and fix one vev equal to zero @xcite . in such way , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the mixing parameter @xmath33 can be eliminated from the lagrangian . expanding the yukawa lagrangian in this parameterization ,",
    "it is found @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix and @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "this equation shows how the fcnc processes are generated in this kind of model . in this case",
    "there are two matrices @xmath30 which lead to 12 new parameters if we suppose that these matrices are real and symmetric .    in the sm",
    "the couplings @xmath38 are proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath40 are couplings like @xmath41 and , if one wishes to avoid fine tuning , then the structure of the mass and the mixing hierarchy suggest that the natural parameterization for fcnc vertices would be the one proportional to the masses of the particles . in the present work we take into account the cheng - sher - yuan ( csy ) parameterization which is the geometric mean of the yukawa couplings of the quark fields @xcite , @xmath42",
    "this is an ansatz for the yukawa texture matrices looking for a phenomenological similarity with sm couplings . under these assumptions ,",
    "the relative couplings are proportional to @xmath43 where the parameters @xmath44 are those that generate a hierarchy between the up - type and down - type couplings .",
    "bounds and restrictions on the @xmath45 for the quark sector and @xmath40 for the leptonic sector can be found in literature @xcite .",
    "many scenarios for the @xmath45 parameters have been analyzed under different phenomenological considerations . in the case of the leptonic sector , some constraints have been imposed on the @xmath45 using different lepton flavor violating processes and the @xmath46 factor .",
    "analysis of possible detection of the higgs boson at tevatron and lhc using lepton flavor violating decays have been already presented @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the quark sector has been less restricted , however three different scenarios are discussed in reference @xcite using the available phenomenology .",
    "the first scenario discussed was assuming the whole set of @xmath47 common to all the flavour changing couplings but it was discarded by low energy experiments .",
    "the second one is useful to guide to the third one which have more physical relevance .",
    "the third scenario is established when the parameters related with the flavor changing vertex between first and second generation are negligible and @xmath48 , @xmath49 bigger than one while @xmath50 , @xmath51 smaller than one . in table 1",
    "we display a summary of the bounds that we use in the present work .",
    "the leptonic element @xmath52 has a bound coming from @xmath53 muon factor and it is interesting because the interval does not contain the zero like the others do . the bounds on @xmath48 and @xmath50 are gotten using the criterion of validness of perturbation theory looking at the vertex @xmath54 . on the other hand , bounds for the parameter @xmath51",
    "have actually been calculated taking into account the contribution of @xmath55 vertex at one loop level on the electroweak precision observables @xcite .",
    ".some constraints on the flavor changing neutral parameters obtained in the literature@xcite and they will be taken into account in section 4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is the lightest higgs boson in the model and their decays are forbidden into another higgs bosons .",
    "the decay channels to heavy quarks and leptons are @xmath56 ; and the relevant fcnc decays at tree level in the 2hdm type iii are @xmath57 which in the csy parameterization could be as high as the standard ones .",
    "the decay width of a scalar particle into two different fermions is @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 for leptons(quarks ) and @xmath60 the feynman s rule for the @xmath61 vertex .    for @xmath62",
    "are necessary to consider off - shell and the on - shell processes according to the higgs mass . for",
    "the on - shell processes the widths lead to @xmath63 @xmath64 for off - shell processes one of the gauge boson in the final state is a virtual gauge which can decay into two fermions .",
    "the decay widths in the context of the sm higgs boson can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "but they have a @xmath65 factor , which comes from the couplings in the 2hdm .    at one loop - level",
    "the considered decays are @xmath66 .",
    "the first one , the decay width of @xmath1 into photons is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 are functions depending of the particle into the loop and @xmath69 correspond to scalar , fermion , and gauge boson , respectively , and they are defined in reference @xcite .",
    "then , the sum is over top and bottom quarks , @xmath70 gauge boson and @xmath21 the scalar charged higgs boson .",
    "@xmath71 are relative couplings given by the 2hdm - iii , and we use the feynmman s rule for the vertex @xmath72 assuming an invariant @xmath0 potential , @xmath73    the process @xmath74 is quiet similar to the last one , but it can only have quarks into the loop . using again the two heaviest quarks the decay width is @xmath75",
    "r_i^{h^0}\\right|^2,\\ ] ] with @xmath76 and @xmath77 also defined in reference @xcite .",
    "finally we take the process @xmath78 .",
    "this loop could be more complicated than the others and it depends of fermionic , scalar and bosonic sectors .",
    "the decay width can be written as @xmath79 with the amplitudes @xmath80 and @xmath81 defined in references @xcite .",
    "all these loop processes are sensitive to variations of the parameters which are model dependent .",
    "the figure 1 shows the ratios @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 versus the higgs boson mass , @xmath85 , under different choices of the model parameters as it is indicated in the figure caption .",
    "the cases labeled @xmath86 correspond to the asymptotic limits of the 2hdm - iii to the sm values , and therefore for these cases the ratios would be equal to one .",
    "the other cases show the possible deviations from the sm .",
    "the decay widths are suppressed in the low higgs boson mass range due to the factor @xmath87 in the @xmath88 couplings coming from the 2hdm .",
    "the figure 2 shows the branching ratios for @xmath1 , when fcnc processes are introduced in the possible higgs @xmath1 decays in the framework of the 2hdm - iii .",
    "the csy parameterization is used and a particular case is taken into account when all @xmath45 in the quark sector are all the same order equal to one , but for the leptonic sector we take the values showed in table 1 .",
    "thus , it shows all the branching ratios for @xmath1 in the 2hdm - iii with @xmath89 tev for the charged higgs mass and @xmath90 .",
    "the case @xmath91 and heavy charged higgs boson reproduces the sm branching ratios , and it gives us the chance to check consistency ; we compare with results using computational packages as hdecay @xcite ; for small values of @xmath85 the dominant decays are @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite . for the case",
    "@xmath94 the decay modes @xmath7 and @xmath95 disappear and therefore the modes @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the dominant modes in the region of heavy higgs boson mass . for a light higgs boson",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath98 , and the fraction for @xmath99 is one order of magnitude lower than the sm result because the @xmath100 contribution is not present into the loop and only quarks are contributing .",
    "the comparison between plots in figure 2 , let us know what happens with fcnc scenarios with respect to the sm predictions .",
    "the @xmath101 branching fraction is one order of magnitude bigger than the sm mode and for a heavy higgs boson it is higher than the @xmath102 one , contrary to the sm . on the other hand , @xmath103 and",
    "@xmath102 modes are at the same order .",
    "the fcnc @xmath104 is the same order of @xmath105 for @xmath106180 gev ; but in the kinematic limits for @xmath107 decay the br(@xmath105 ) is one order of magnitude lower than the sm .",
    "the figure 3 shows the branching fractions taking into account a more realistic scenario according to the phenomenological constraints for @xmath45 from table 1 . in this case , the channels @xmath92 and @xmath108 are the leading decays in the light higgs mass limit .",
    "this is because in the range of intermediate higgs boson mass still dominate @xmath109 decays , but at a heavier higgs boson mass , the vector bosons reach some importance and @xmath109 decays loose supremacy , opening a window to the @xmath110 channel .",
    "the leptonic @xmath111 decays are in the same order than @xmath102 , and always bigger than the other one loop decays .",
    "it is remarkable that the fcnc channel @xmath112 is more important than @xmath113 , almost in one order of magnitude .",
    "the larger values for the vertex factors in the leptonic sector lead these processes to be relevant in the sector of about 1 decays through these channels each @xmath114 higgs events . finally we can say that the @xmath115 is indiscernible because of the small size of the coupling .",
    "the figure 4 is a similar scenario to the figure 3 , but the hierarchy between @xmath116 and @xmath117 is changed in one order of magnitude .",
    "the same assumption was made for the leptonic sector . in this case ,",
    "the branching ratios for the @xmath1 into fermions without flavour changing are only one order of magnitude bigger than the similar ones with flavour changing .    in the 2hdm - iii",
    "the relation between two branching ratios can be written as @xmath118 taking off kinematic factors .",
    "when @xmath119 but bigger than one the ratio @xmath120 , it means that the branching ratios are at the same order of magnitude for any value of @xmath20 different of @xmath121 .",
    "it is the scenario presented in figure 4 .",
    "however if @xmath119 but smaller than one the ratio @xmath122 is proportional to @xmath123 which implies that the branching ratio @xmath124 is going to be bigger than the branching ratio @xmath125 .",
    "it is precisely the situation showed in figure 3 .",
    "furthermore , in figure 3 when @xmath20 goes from @xmath126 to zero the ratio @xmath127 goes from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "a photon collider provides a scenario to look for new physics @xcite .",
    "the collider @xmath130 , @xmath131 are based on compton backscattering of laser light off the high energy electrons of linear collider .",
    "most important photon colliders which are under construction are tesla @xcite , nlc@xcite , jlc @xcite and clic @xcite .",
    "these colliders have a huge importance , because typical cross sections of interesting processes in @xmath130 collisions , as charged pair production , are higher than those in @xmath132 collisions by about one order of magnitude , so the number of events in @xmath130 collisions will be larger than @xmath132 collisions . besides , these photons will have a high degree of circular polarization , allowing different @xmath133 states more than @xmath132 collider .",
    "the production of neutral scalars at photon colliders is mediated by one loop - level processes , and it is interesting to see that @xmath134 vertex is sensitive to small variations of particle couplings into the loop . in particular , different scenarios of 2hdm - iii parameters will produce a huge change in the @xmath135 vertex .",
    "this sensitive vertex will allow the possibility of distinguish the scalar boson from different models @xcite .",
    "in photon colliders the number of events of @xmath1 produced as a resonance of fermions in the final state , @xmath136 , is given by @xcite @xmath137 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath138 is the product of the helicities of the two colliding photons , @xmath139 is the differential luminosity for the @xmath130 collider and the resolution width is defined by @xmath140 with @xmath141 the experimental width allowed by the detector .",
    "the background signal is given by the process @xmath142 , and the number of events are @xcite @xmath143 where @xmath144+\\frac{3-\\beta^4}{2}\\ln\\frac{1+\\beta z_0}{1-\\beta z_0}\\right.\\cr & + & \\left.\\lambda\\lambda'\\beta z_0\\left[1+\\frac{2(1-\\beta^2)}{1-\\beta^2z_0 ^ 2}-\\frac{1}{\\beta z_0}\\ln\\frac{1+\\beta z_0}{1-\\beta z_0}\\right]\\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath145 and @xmath146 the maximum sweep detector angle .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cross section is evaluated in the @xmath1 resonance and , worthwhile that the background is proportional to @xmath147 .",
    "tesla ( tev electron superconducting linear accelerator ) , will work with a solid angle resolution about @xmath148 , an average polarization @xmath149 , a luminosity d @xmath150 @xmath151 s@xmath152 in a year , a cm energy @xmath153=500 gev and an experimental resolution about 5 gev @xcite .    in figure 5 using the same parameters as figure 4",
    ", we can see the number of events of the higgs signal ( s ) according to the 2hdm - iii and its corresponding background signal ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath92 channel is in fact the best channel for @xmath1 decays , and for light higgs boson mass .",
    "it is always above its own background signal .",
    "it is different form the sm case where only in a small region near to @xmath154 gev , the signal is bigger than the background signal@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the background signal for heavy lepton pair production is bigger than those decays into quarks .",
    "this result was expected , because photons couple through the electromagnetic charge , and leptons has integer charge , therefore its background will not have any suppression factor , as already happens with quarks .",
    "the @xmath1 signal from leptonic decays is undetectable , owing to have one higgs boson which decays in leptons each @xmath155 charged pair @xmath156 produced .",
    "now , the background signal for @xmath110 is always bigger at least one order of magnitude , however the detection of this @xmath157 of signal is strongly dependent of the top decays .",
    "let us examine what happens with fcnc processes in the quark sector , @xmath113 and @xmath108 .",
    "we start with @xmath113 process .",
    "charm quark could be detected through its jet , but top quark decay in @xmath158 .",
    "bottom quark would be tagged and @xmath100 boson could suffer leptonic decays @xmath159 or can generate a quark pair .",
    "the channel with @xmath100 leptonic decays can be easily reconstructed by lost energy and information from the electromagnetic calorimeter , so the most promising signal would be @xmath160 . for",
    "the hadronic decay of the @xmath100 boson , a background possibility is @xmath161 , this case will have difficulties for @xmath1 detection because the @xmath113 signal is smaller than @xmath92 background signal .",
    "for the @xmath108 channel , we would have a @xmath162 and a @xmath163 .",
    "in general , these fcnc channels will have not background , and we will have some statistics for @xmath1 detection .",
    "a deeper analysis with noise from nlo qcd correction could be found in reference @xcite .",
    "it is important remark that the analysis for fcnc process in the quark sector , is quite similar for the others photon colliders .",
    "cliche ( compact linear collider higgs experiment ) @xcite , developed on clic 1 at low energy will work with @xmath164 , a geometrical position of the detector at @xmath148 , the luminosity @xmath165 @xmath151 s@xmath152 , a cm energy @xmath166 gev and an experimental resolution given by 3.3 gev .",
    "the figure 5 shows the behavior of @xmath1 at clic photon collider .",
    "it will be working at a lower energy than tesla and therefore some qed and qcd phenomena that can appear in the laser vanish , increasing the number of events .",
    "clic could only create too light @xmath1 as far as 150 gev , through @xmath92 channel , which is the most indicated channel for light scalar detection .",
    "clic will produce near to @xmath167 events of @xmath1 in a year , by using @xmath168 signal , while the background will be the @xmath169 of the signal , being this a great scenario to measure the light @xmath1 properties .",
    "it is obvious that there are no kinematic conditions for top quark production .",
    "now , the fcnc process @xmath108 will be bigger than @xmath92 background signal , then as we already mentioned will be this channel easily reconstructed , leaving a huge window for fcnc detection at clic . for leptonic decays ,",
    "again the background affect enormously the @xmath1 signal .",
    "the @xmath156 @xmath1 signal is around @xmath170 of the background , which makes the @xmath1 higgs boson undetectable through leptonic decays .",
    "something similar happens with @xmath112 process .",
    "finally we will analyze the @xmath1 production and detection at nlc ( next linear collider ) @xcite .",
    "this collider will work with a polarization average @xmath171 , @xmath172 @xmath151 s@xmath152 for a cm energy @xmath173 gev and the experimental width of the detector near to 13.1 gev .",
    "the figure 5 shows the number of @xmath1 expected in nlc through fermionic decays and its noise signal .",
    "if @xmath85 is below @xmath174 gev then the higgs boson should be detected and its couplings determinate in nlc through @xmath92 decay , due to this signal larger than the background signal .",
    "same as tesla , the background of @xmath110 channel is bigger than its @xmath1 signal , this obstruct the detection in pair top production .",
    "the leptonic fcnc process do not reach to appear in the figure , and the charged lepton pair production with @xmath1 in the resonance loose importance because of the @xmath156 and @xmath175 background signal .",
    "again , the interesting fcnc channel are given by the quark sector .",
    "the @xmath108 show a production of 5000 @xmath1 events near to the top resonance , getting too close to @xmath92 background signal . in this region",
    "the fcnc process will be easily detected , but in the rest of the spectrum the detection will be strongly determinate by the b - tagging within the vertex detector .",
    "the addition of a second higgs doublet , as an extension of the sm , lead to different new physics scenarios .",
    "one of them is the 2hdm - iii where discrete symmetries are not imposed and it generates a general yukawa lagrangian with fcnc at tree level .",
    "this fact makes the 2hdm - iii a very complex model and there are not relations between the scalar spectrum as already happen in 2hdm - ii . in the yukawa sector",
    "there are twelve new parameters which generate fcnc or modify the sm @xmath1 couplings .",
    "we first study the decay widths of the lightest @xmath0-even higgs boson @xmath1 at tree level and at one loop level .",
    "the new physics effects can be tested into the loops for different values of the fcnc parameters , and hence different 2hdm - iii scenarios can be proposed . in particular , the case for @xmath91 and a heavy charged higgs boson reproduces the sm predictions for the branchings ratios . in the other cases the one loop widths are lower than sm . for high higgs boson mass range",
    "the 2hdm has parameter scenarios where @xmath176 is bigger than sm width .    in figure 2",
    "we consider one scenario where all @xmath45 in the quark sector are equal to one @xcite . in this case",
    "the new fcnc at tree level are of the same order of the sm ones . however , when @xmath91 the new physics is decoupled and the sm s branchings are reproduced for a heavy charged higgs boson .    in the other figures we take into account more realistic scenarios for the @xmath45 coming from the 2hdm contributions to different phenomenology processes",
    ". the branching ratios of the one loop decays are one or two orders of magnitude lower than the sm due to the new channels @xmath177 and @xmath178 which are at the same order of @xmath179 and @xmath180 , respectively .",
    "a very particular scenario is when @xmath94 . in this scenario @xmath181 and @xmath182 couplings are equal to zero , and @xmath183 and @xmath184 are the most important channels for light and heavy higgs boson , respectively .",
    "but the fcnc at tree level @xmath185 and @xmath186 decay modes are close to them .",
    "now , in @xmath130 and @xmath102 branching ratios the contributions into the loops are only coming from fermions because the gauge sector is decoupled into the loops in the @xmath187 decay .    on the other hand , for the 2hdm - iii",
    "we write down the expression ( [ razon ] ) where it is saying that for big values of @xmath119 , the decays involving flavour change are at the same order that those without flavour change . otherwise for small values of @xmath45 , the flavour changing channels are too small .",
    "all these means that the detection of fermionic flavour changes at tree level is not enough to test the 2hdm - iii .",
    "however if the branching ratios or the number of events of @xmath1 produced satisfy a relationship like equation ( [ razon ] ) , that could be the first indication that 2hdm - iii is important to reveal the presence of new physics .",
    "finally , we have set up one sm - like scenario but introducing fcnc processes and we analyze the @xmath1 detection and production at photon colliders such as tesla , clic and nlc .",
    "we use fermionic decays and the cross sections evaluated in the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "we calculate the background signals for @xmath1 decays , using the helicity formalism in order to do a naive analysis of the possible noise within the detector .",
    "the background signals are proportional to @xmath188 , and then lepton channels have bigger noise than quarks channels .",
    "the signal for the @xmath1 decays into a pair of quarks are one order of magnitude higher than the similar decays with flavor changing , however the second one does not have any background signal .",
    "this is an interesting scenario to produce and detect higgs bosons and a possibility to test new physics beyond the sm .",
