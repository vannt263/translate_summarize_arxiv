    "three nucleon bound state calculations are traditionally carried out by solving faddeev equations in a partial wave truncated basis , which leads to a set of a finite number of coupled equations in two variables for the amplitude .",
    "this is performed either in momentum space @xcite , in configuration space @xcite , or in a hybrid fashion using both spaces @xcite .",
    "though a few partial waves often provide qualitative insight , modern three nucleon bound state calculations need 34 or more different isospin , spin and orbital angular momentum combinations @xcite .",
    "it appears therefore natural to avoid a partial wave representation completely and work directly with vector variables .",
    "this is common practice in bound state calculations of few nucleon systems based on variational @xcite and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods @xcite .",
    "those methods are normally carried out in configuration space , and while providing accurate results for the binding energy , the gfmc method samples the wave function only stochastically . up to now",
    "the faddeev equations have been solved applying vector variables only in configuration space for pure coulomb bound state problems , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems @xcite .",
    "there are other accurate techniques for solving for the three body binding energy based on correlated hyperspherical harmonic variational techniques @xcite and the gaussian basis coupled channel methods @xcite , which , however , all work with partial wave decomposition .",
    "our aim is to work directly with vector variables in the faddeev scheme in momentum space . under these circumstances the two - body @xmath2-matrices",
    "should also be determined directly as function of momentum vectors .",
    "this is not too difficult and has been recently demonstrated for two - body @xmath2-matrices based on malfliet - tjon type potentials @xcite .",
    "the choice of momentum vectors as adequate variables is also suggested by the nn force . here",
    "the dependence on momentum vectors can be rather simple , e.g. , in the case of the widely used one - boson exchange force , whereas the partial wave representation of this force leads to rather complicated expressions @xcite .    instead of first summing up two - body interactions to infinite order into two - body @xmath2-matrices and",
    "obtain connected kernel equations , the schrdinger equation for the three nucleon ( 3n ) bound state can be solved directly @xcite . in that work",
    "the schrdinger equation was solved in momentum space for identical particles without partial wave decomposition for malfliet - tjon type interactions .",
    "we do not want to follow this avenue but rather solve the faddeev equations in momentum space directly in a three dimensional form .",
    "section ii describes our solution of the faddeev equations as function of the momentum vectors and contrast this new approach with the standard form given in a partial wave decomposition .",
    "we work with spinless nucleons and thus formulate the faddeev equations for a system of three bosons . in section iii",
    "we discuss details of our algorithm for solving the faddeev equations for the three body bound state and demonstrate the stability of our numerical approach as well as compare to results obtained from partial wave based calculations . in section",
    "iv we show properties of the faddeev amplitude and the full wave function and demonstrate that the results obtained from the three dimensional approach and the ones coming from partial waves agree very well with each other .",
    "we compare momentum distributions and expectation values calculated within the two schemes . in section",
    "v we demonstrate that the schrdinger equation is fulfilled pointwise by the full wave function generated in the three dimensional approach . to the best of our knowledge",

    "the bound state of three identical particles which interact via pairwise forces @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and cyclic permutations thereof ) is given by a schrdinger equation which read in integral form @xmath5 here the free propagator is given by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 stands for the free hamiltonian . introducing faddeev components @xmath8 with @xmath9 leads to the three coupled integral equations @xmath10 the operator @xmath11 describes the two - body @xmath2-matrix in the subsystem @xmath12 . if we consider identical particles ( here bosons , since we are omitting spin ) , the three nucleon wave function @xmath13 has to be totally symmetric . as a consequence , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16",
    "are identical in their functional form , only the particles are permuted .",
    "thus it is sufficient to consider only one component @xmath17 where the arbitrarily chosen index @xmath18 is dropped . in this case",

    "the jacobi momenta in the different two - body subsystems @xmath27 and @xmath28 are expressed through those defined in the subsystem @xmath29 via @xmath30 this allows to evaluate the permutation operator given in eq .",

    "the explicit form of @xmath52 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the expression given in this reference is more complicated due to spin and isospin variables . for the convenience of the reader we give @xmath52 defined for general total orbital angular momentum in appendix a explicitly .",

    "@xcite , but should be considered without spin and isospin factors . the resulting expression for the here considered bosonic case is given in appendix a.",
    "for our model calculations we use yukawa interactions of malfliet - tjon @xcite type , @xmath70 we study two different types of pairwise forces , a purely attractive yukawa interaction and a superposition of a short - ranged repulsive and a long - ranged attractive yukawa interaction . in order to be able to compare our calculations with results obtained by other methods we use the malfliet - tjon potentials mt - iv and mt - v @xcite . however , we use slightly different parameters as given in ref .",

    "we also need to point out that we calculate the potentials as functions of vector momenta and thus define the interaction as a truly local force acting in all partial waves .    with this interaction",
    "we first solve the lippmann - schwinger equation for the fully - off - shell two - nucleon @xmath2-matrix directly as function of the vector variables as described in detail in ref .",

    "we would like to point out that after having solved the lippmann - schwinger equation on gaussian grids for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , we solve the integral equation again to obtain the @xmath2-matrix at points @xmath77 .",
    "thus , when iterating eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) , we do not have to extrapolate numerically to angle points @xmath76 of @xmath73 , which can very well be located outside the upper or lower boundary of the gaussian grid of the @xmath2-matrix .    the eigenvalue equation , eq .",

    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) is fulfilled with a relative accuracy of @xmath84 at each point @xmath85 .    in order to solve the eigenvalue equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) , for the faddeev component @xmath57 we use gaussian grid points in @xmath74 , @xmath86 , and @xmath76 , though only the @xmath86-variable is a true integration variable .",
    "typical grid sizes are @xmath87 to obtain an accuracy in the binding energy of 4 significant figures .",
    "this grid contains @xmath76 points for @xmath88 as well as the points @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the iteration of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) requires a two - dimensional interpolation on @xmath57 in the variables @xmath74 and @xmath76 . by including the additional grid points",

    "the @xmath91-integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) is cut off at a value of @xmath92  @xmath93 .",

    "the value for @xmath95 is chosen to be 10  @xmath93 .",
    "typical values for nq1 and nq2 are 64 and 32 to obtain the above mentioned accuracy . for the distribution of quadrature points",
    "we use the maps given in ref .",
    "the @xmath96 integration requires typically at least 32 integration points , while for the @xmath45 integration 20 points are already sufficient .",
    "the @xmath45 integration acts only on @xmath97 and can thus be carried out before starting to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath74 variable is also defined in an interval @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is chosen to be 9  @xmath93 and @xmath100  @xmath93 .",
    "the two intervals contain np1 and np2 points , and we choose np1 = nq1 and np2 = nq2 respectively .",
    "the momentum dependencies given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) suggest that we solve the two - body @xmath2-matrix @xmath101 on the momentum grid @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the energies @xmath102 dictated by the same @xmath86-grid .",
    "it turns out that it is sufficient to choose for the variable @xmath76 the same grid which is used for solving the two - body lippmann - schwinger equation for @xmath101 . in order to obtain the second momentum and the angle for @xmath101 required in the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) , we have to carry out two - dimensional interpolations .",
    "we use the cubic hermitean splines of ref .",
    "the functional form of those splines is described in detail in appendix  b of this reference and shall not be repeated here .",
    "we find these splines superior to standard b - splines @xcite in capturing the peak structure of the two - body @xmath2-matrix , which occurs for off - shell momenta @xmath103 . in fig .",

    "the two steep dips at @xmath77 dominate the off - shell structure and are present for all off - shell momenta @xmath107 .",
    "an additional advantage of the cubic hermitean splines is their computational speed , which is an important factor , since the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) requires a very large number of interpolations .",
    "finally , to obtain the faddeev component entering the integration we also need a two - dimensional interpolation and use the same as for the @xmath2-matrix .",
    "in table  ii we show the convergence of the three nucleon binding energy as function of the number of grid points for the malfliet - tjon potentials mt - v and mt - iv .",
    "we use the potential parameters as given in table  i. in table  iii the convergence of the energy eigenvalues for the same potentials resulting from the solution of the partial wave faddeev equation for an optimized set of @xmath74 and @xmath86 grid points as function of the angular momentum @xmath56 is given .",
    "as demonstrated in table  ii , the calculation of the three nucleon binding energy using the malfliet - tjon potential v converges to a value of @xmath108  mev .",

    "both values are also in very good agreement with the value @xmath115  mev quoted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as we can see from these comparisons to calculations of the three nucleon binding energy based on the solution of the faddeev equations in partial waves , our results provide the same accuracy while the numerical procedures are actually easier to implement . in the three dimensional case",
    "there is only one single equation to be solved , whereas in the partial wave case one has a set of coupled equations with a kernel containing relatively complicated geometrical expressions @xmath116 and @xmath117 matrices to larger values of @xmath56 .",
    "the latter ones are driven by the partial wave projected potential matrix elements @xmath118 , which require for large @xmath56-values and larger @xmath74-values ( 80 - 100 @xmath93 ) great care to be generated reliably .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2-matrices are generated more easily as functions of vector momenta from the original potential . once an accurate and fast two dimensional interpolation scheme is established , the implementation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) is rather simple .",
    "when solving eq .  ( [ eq:2.13 ] ) for the bound state , we obtain the faddeev component @xmath57 , and the symmetry relation for the faddeev component reads explicitly @xmath119 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) this symmetry is only fulfilled because of the @xmath120-integration over the complete 2@xmath121 interval .",
    "we verified that our numerical solution satisfies this symmetry with high accuracy .",
    "in fact , this symmetry property can be implemented in the iteration of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) to cut down the size of the field @xmath57 and thus save time and memory when computing the integral .",
    "we would like to remark that for the initial calculations we did not take advantage of this symmetry property in order to use the numerical verification as a test for the accuracy of the integration and interpolation .    in fig .  2 we display magnitude of the faddeev component at a fixed angle , obtained from a calculation based on the mt - v potential .",
    "the norm is chosen such that @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the full 3n wave function as given in eq .",
    "the major contributions to @xmath57 arise from momenta @xmath74 and @xmath86 less than 1.5  @xmath93 .",
    "it also turns out that the dependence of @xmath57 on the angle between the jacobi momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 is so weak that it can only be detected on a logarithmic scale but not when comparing linear plots at different values of x. this is understandable , since the admixture of the @xmath124 partial waves into the faddeev amplitude is less than 0.01% . to show this we choose the normalization differently from above as @xmath125 or , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13c ] ) @xmath126    similar we define for the full wave function    @xmath127    the partial wave contributions @xmath128 and @xmath129 are given in table  iv for the different @xmath56 values .",
    "the logarithmic presentation in fig .",
    "2 allows to see not only the smooth bell - like decrease of the faddeev amplitude for @xmath74 and @xmath86 less than 1.5  @xmath93 but also the deep valleys caused by the node lines of the amplitude . a more detailed inspection of the faddeev amplitude is presented in fig .",
    "the partial wave amplitudes @xmath130 are projected out numerically from the full amplitude @xmath57 and compared to the amplitudes @xmath130 directly determined from the coupled set of equations given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13a ] ) .",
    "we show contour plots for the @xmath56 values 0 , 2 , and 4 .",
    "one can see that for the higher @xmath56 values the maximum of the partial wave amplitudes moves to larger @xmath74 and @xmath86 values .",
    "it is also apparent from the figure that the graphs representing the three dimensional calculation and those for ones based on partial waves are nearly everywhere indistinguishable .",
    "this underlines the accuracy and consistency in the numerical realization of both schemes . only for @xmath131 and very small @xmath86-values deviations",
    "there the contour lines have to be almost parallel to the @xmath74-axis , indicating the proper threshold behavior for very small @xmath86 .",
    "this is not the case in the 3d approach .",
    "however , the value of the amplitude is smaller by 6 orders of magnitude compared to the value of the the @xmath132 amplitude at these values . in both cases we hit numerical inaccuracies here for the number of grid points chosen .",

    "we would like to reiterate here , that for the solution of the faddeev equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.13 ] ) , only two - dimensional interpolations are required . to carry out the 3d interpolation we use standard",
    "b - splines as given in @xcite .",
    "in case of the wave function b - splines turned out to be slightly more accurate on the given grids compared to the cubic hermite splines .",

    "a comparison with fig .",
    "4 shows that for the purely attractive potential the significant pieces of the wave function are more shifted to slightly larger momenta @xmath74 and @xmath86 .",
    "this is consistent with the larger binding energy given by the mt - iv potential , which causes the 3n system to be tighter bound when viewed in configuration space and thus giving a more extended structure in momentum space .",
    "due to the lack of repulsion this wave function does not change sign .      in applications one does not access the wave function directly but rather only certain matrix elements thereof .",
    "one example , which can be ` measured ' at least approximately in electron scattering is the momentum distribution , the probability to find a nucleon with momentum @xmath86 in the nucleus . in our case",

    "the graph shows that the 3n schrdinger equation is fulfilled with a numerical accuracy better than 1% for momenta @xmath74 and @xmath86 up to 6  @xmath93 .",
    "this is a typical range of momenta which enters calculations of matrix elements , e.g. , for electron scattering .",
    "when @xmath74 exceeds values of 10  @xmath93 the relative error becomes larger than 5% for almost all values of @xmath86 .",
    "this behavior can be explained by inspecting the different faddeev amplitudes separately as they are given in eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) . if one considers the value @xmath173 as shown in fig .",
    "9 , one sees that for @xmath174  @xmath93 and @xmath175  @xmath93 the faddeev amplitude @xmath176 is needed at a value @xmath177  @xmath93 , which is outside the @xmath86-range the faddeev equation was solved in this particular case . instead of extrapolating , we set @xmath178 , which introduces a small discontinuity in the wave function .",
    "though not visible in integrations over the wave function , this leads to a larger error when considering the pointwise accuracy of the 3n schrdinger equation .",
    "of course , this larger error in @xmath133 is completely irrelevant in all practical cases , since for those large momenta @xmath74 and @xmath86 the wave function @xmath133 drops by about 8 orders of magnitude compared to its value at the origin . in the relevant momentum regions",
    "the 3n schrdinger equation is fulfilled with very good accuracy by our three dimensional wave function .",
    "this statement holds for all @xmath76 values .    for the above study we chose the wave function obtained from the mt - iv potential , since this wave function does not have any node lines",
    "it is quite obvious that our definition of the relative error would give a large error at the locations where @xmath133 approaches zero .",
    "in fact , when calculating the relative error with the wave function obtained from the mt - v potential , we can identify the node lines of the wave function quite clearly .",
    "an alternative approach to state - of - the - art three nucleon bound state calculations , which are based on solving the faddeev equations in a partial wave truncated basis , is to work directly with momentum vector variables .",
    "we formulate the faddeev equations for identical particles as function of vector jacobi momenta , specifically the magnitudes of the momenta and the angle between them , and demonstrate their numerical feasibility and the accuracy of their solutions . as two - body force we concentrated on a superposition of an attractive and repulsive yukawa interaction , which is typical for nuclear physics , as well as on an attractive yukawa interaction .",
    "the corresponding two - body @xmath2-matrix , which enters the faddeev equations was also calculated as function of vector momenta .",
    "we neglected spin degrees of freedom in all our calculations .",
    "as first test for the numerical accuracy of the solution of the faddeev equation as function of vector variables , which is a three dimensional integral equation , we determined the energy eigenvalue of the bound system and compared our result with the one obtained in a traditional faddeev calculation carried out in a partial wave truncated basis .",
    "we achieved excellent agreement between the two approaches as well as excellent agreement with calculations in the literature .",
    "we also found that the three dimensional faddeev amplitude is nearly independent of the angle between the two jacobi momenta .",
    "this is of course in agreement with the insights gained from the approach in the partial wave scheme .    from the faddeev amplitude we obtained the 3n wave function .",
    "we found here also that the dependence on the angle between the two jacobi momenta is quite weak .",
    "we then performed a partial wave decomposition of our three dimensional solutions for the faddeev amplitude and the 3n wave function and compared the so obtained partial wave amplitudes with the ones directly calculated .",
    "again we found excellent agreement between the two approaches . in order to further probe the quality of our wave function we calculated the momentum distributions @xmath139 and @xmath143 and demonstrated that partial wave contributions up to @xmath110 are necessary to build up the distribution @xmath139 for large momentum transfers @xmath86 . in a similar vain we showed that higher partial waves are needed to fill in the sharp dip in @xmath143 , which is obtained in a pure @xmath179-wave calculation .    for a stringent test of the three dimensional wave function we inserted it into the 3n schrdinger equation and evaluated the accuracy with which the eigenvalue equation is fulfilled throughout the entire space where the solution is defined .",
    "we found that within the physical relevant momentum region , namely @xmath74 and @xmath86 less than 10  @xmath93 , the 3n schrdinger equation is fulfilled with high accuracy by our numerical solution of the faddeev equation .",
    "summarizing we can state that the three dimensional faddeev equation for a bound state can be handled in a straightforward and numerically reliable fashion .",
    "once supplemented by spin degrees of freedom , this approach will most likely be more easily implemented than the traditional partial wave based method .",
    "state - of - the - art bound state calculations with realistic nuclear force models typically require at least 34 channels .",
    "the incorporation of 3n forces will most likely also be less cumbersome in a three dimensional approach .",
