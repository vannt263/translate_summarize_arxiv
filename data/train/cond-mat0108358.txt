    "recently , thermodynamics of quantum integrable spin chains related to superalgebras received attentions .",
    "in particular , there are several papers @xcite on thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations @xcite related to @xmath3 .",

    "this is also generalized @xcite to the case of the fundamental representation of @xmath6 .",
    "the tba equation for a supersymmetric extended hubbard model , which is related to the fundamental representation of @xmath7 , is proposed in @xcite .",
    "one can also find tba equations beyond the fundamental representations .",
    "the tba equation of a generalized @xmath4 model , which is based on a tensor representation of @xmath5 , is proposed in @xcite .",
    "as is well known , @xmath3 admits finite dimensional representations with continuous parameters .",
    "in fact the tba equation of the model for electrons with generalized hopping terms and hubbard interaction , which is related to one parameter family of four dimensional representations of @xmath5 , is proposed in @xcite . in the case of @xmath3 , the tba equation with a continuous parameter",
    "is studied @xcite in relation with the continuum limit of integrable spin chains .",
    "these tba equations are derived by the traditional string hypothesis @xcite .",
    "one can also derive the same tba equations by the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) method @xcite .",
    "in fact the tba equations for the supersymmetric @xmath4 model @xcite and the supersymmetric extended hubbard model @xcite are also derived @xcite by the qtm method based on the @xmath3 version of the @xmath2-system @xcite ( a system of functional relations among transfer matrices of fusion models ) .",
    "on the other hand , study on tba equations for @xmath8 case has begun quite recently in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which we deal with the simplest @xmath9 model from the point of view of the string hypothesis and the qtm method .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix of the @xmath8 models are given as solutions of the graded yang - baxter equations @xcite , which have bosonic and fermionic degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix of the @xmath8 models are proposed in @xcite .",
    "moreover they are constructed from the point of view of automorphisms of lie superalgebras and classical graded yang - baxter equations @xcite ; quantum supergroups @xcite ; braid - monoid algebras @xcite .",
    "some special examples are also examined from various context .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . as for eigenvalue formulae of transfer matrices , @xmath9 model @xcite and @xmath0 model @xcite",
    "are solved by the analytic bethe ansatz ; @xmath11 models @xcite are solved by the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "these works deal with models related to fundamental representations . as for more complicated representations",
    ", we have executed an analytic bethe ansatz @xcite related to @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite , in which super yangian analogue of young supertableaux are proposed and @xmath2-systems among them are also found .",
    "the @xmath8 integrable spin chain is related to interesting physical problems , such as the loop model which is related to statistical properties of polymers@xcite , and the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , etc .",
    "so it is desirable to study the @xmath8 integrable spin chain beyond the @xmath9 case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study tba equations related to @xmath15 by the string hypotheses @xcite and the qtm method @xcite . in section 2 ,",
    "we assume a rather general bethe ansatz equation ( bae ) , and derive the tba equation by the string hypothesis .",
    "we expect this tba equation is the one for a higher spin analogue of the @xmath0 integrable spin chain in ref .",
    "in fact , the high temperature limit of the free energy is expressed by an appropriate solution of a difference equation called the @xmath1-system . in particular for the fundamental representation case",
    ", we also derive the tba equation from the qtm method in section 4 .",
    "namely , we transform the 1d quantum system to the 2d classical system by the suzuki - trotter mapping @xcite , and define a qtm , which is a transfer matrix of an inhomogeneous vertex model .",
    "we consider the qtm in the context of the fusion hierarchy of the model , and derive the functional relations among fusion qtms from the @xmath0 version of the @xmath2-system@xcite . after a dependant variable transformation",
    ", we obtain the @xmath16-system ( which is expected to be a system of functional relations among a solution of the tba equation ) from the @xmath2-system .",
    "finally we transform the @xmath16-system with certain analytical conditions ( anzc conditions : analytic nonzero and constant asymptotics for the large spectral parameter ) into the tba equation .",
    "moreover we find that this tba equation coincides with the one in section 2 .",
    "this indicates the validity of the string hypothesis for the @xmath0 model . in section 5",
    ", we evaluate the low temperature asymptotics of the specific heat .",
    "we express the central charge by the rogers dilogarithmic function and identify it as @xmath17 .",
    "this coincides with the conjecture @xcite by the root density method .",

    "the other is defined as the ordinary trace of the monodromy matrix . in this case , the sign of the bae ( [ bae ] ) will disappear ( @xmath290 ) . as far as the ground state case is concerned , the difference among these formulation of the qtm and the ones in this paper may not be important .    a fermionic formula for @xmath291 coming from a different labeling of the dynkin diagram is proposed in @xcite . taking account of the correspondence @xcite between @xmath291 and @xmath132 , this formula may also be relevant to @xmath0 case .",
