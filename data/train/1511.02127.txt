    "in recent years , the rapidly growing field of diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite has attracted a considerable interest owing to their potential for spintronic devices .",
    "one of the main goals is to combine , the traditional electronic functionality ( charge ) and the spin degree of freedom of the electrons / holes .",
    "this requires optimal candidates that exhibit room temperature ferromagnetism .",
    "recent progress in growth processes of tm - doped iii - v semiconductors has boosted the interest for such novel materials . among iii - v dms , mn doped gaas that could be considered as the prototype is certainly the most widely studied ( both transport and magnetic properties ) . however , the understanding of the fundamental physical properties in these doped compounds involves theoretical speculations which are subject to controversy .",
    "the quest for a model able to capture quantitatively the physics and identify the key physical parameters that control both magnetic and transport properties was a clear open issue over the last decade . till",
    "recently dms based theoretical studies could be split into two main distinct types : ( i ) first principle based approaches @xcite and ( ii ) zener mean field type theories ( zmf ) @xcite .",
    "the first kind is based on density functional theory ( dft ) such as local spin density approximation ( lsda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for instance .",
    "they require no adjustable parameters and are essentially material specific .",
    "the second type is a model approach that includes a realistic description of the host band structure within a 6 bands or 8 bands kohn - luttinger hamiltonian @xcite and a local p - d exchange between itinerant holes and localized impurity spins . in zener",
    "mean field theory the p - d coupling is treated pertubatively and the dilution effects at the lowest order , also known as virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) . as a consequence",
    ", the fermi level lies inside the unperturbed valence band ( vb ) leading to the so called valence band scenario ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) . regarding the specific case of ( ga , mn)as , the perturbative vb picture is inconsistent with first principle based studies . indeed",
    ", density functional calculations clearly predict the existence of a well defined preformed impurity band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) that for a sufficiently large concentration of mn ( beyond 1% ) overlaps with the valence band @xcite .",
    "it is found that the fermi level lies in the resonant impurity band .",
    "thus , ab initio studies clearly support the so called `` impurity band picture '' ( ib ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that both optical conductivity measurements @xcite and proximity of mn doped gaas to the metal - insulator transition @xcite fully support the ib - picture . in spite of all that the issue of vb versus ib scenario is still controversial",
    "on the other hand , the vb scenario remains suitable to describe the physics in ii - vi materials such as mn doped znte , cdte , znse for instance .",
    "the reason for this is the absence of hybridized p - d states in the vicinity of the top of the valence band in these alloys .",
    "in other words , treating the substitution by mn as a perturbation remains a good approximation in ii - vi materials . in the following ,",
    "we present a two step approach that allows to describe both magnetic and/or transport properties of a wide range of diluted magnetic semiconductors . concerning the magnetic properties that are our main concern in this paper the two steps are described as follows .",
    "the first one consists in calculating the magnetic couplings between localized spins randomly distributed in the semiconductor host . to this end",
    "one can use first principle calculations or suitable model approaches .",
    "the purpose is to build the effective heisenberg hamiltonian of the problem .",
    "this spin hamiltonian is diagonalized during the second step within the self consistent local random phase approximation @xcite ( sc - lrpa ) procedure that is described in the next section .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes n@xmath0 interacting spins @xmath1 ( classical or quantum ) randomly distributed in the host lattice is the dilute / disordered heisenberg model , @xmath2 @xmath3 are the spin - spin couplings , the sum runs over all sites and the random variable p@xmath4 is 1 if the site is occupied by an impurity , otherwise 0 . in the case of mn",
    "doped iii - v dms , the localized spin s=5/2 , thus it can be treated classically .    in what follows",
    "the dilute heisenberg hamiltonian is diagonalized using the self - consistent local random phase approximation ( sc - lrpa ) .",
    "it is a semi - analytical method based on finite temperature green s functions that describe the spin fluctuations .",
    "this powerful approach offers several advantages .",
    "compared to standard classical monte carlo simulations ( mc ) , ( i ) it allows calculations on large system sizes , ( ii ) the cpu and memory cost are relatively low , ( iii ) the critical temperature is given by a semi - analytical expression ( no need to calculate binder cumulants as in mc ) , ( iv ) the t - dependent local magnetizations , susceptibility and magnetic excitation spectrum can be calculated directly as well .    in order to calculate the magnetic properties we define the following retarded green s function @xmath5 , where @xmath6\\rangle$ ] , ( @xmath7 denotes the thermal average ) .",
    "g@xmath8 describes the transverse and thermal spin fluctuations .",
    "after tyablicov ( or rpa ) decoupling of the higher - order green s functions that appear in the equation of motion of @xmath9 one finds , @xmath10 for convenience we have introduced the reduced variable @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the averaged magnetization in the sample ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 . for each configuration of the disorder ( random positions of the impurities ) , the local t - dependent magnetizations @xmath15 are calculated self - consistently .",
    "@xmath16 is an effective n@xmath17n@xmath0 non hermitian , bi - orthogonal matrix @xcite whose matrix elements are , @xmath18 the property of bi - orthogonality implies a set of right and left eigenvectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , each pair associated with the same eigenvalue @xmath21 ( @xmath22=1,2, .. n@xmath0 )",
    ".    the retarded green s function can be re - written , @xmath23        the sc - lrpa has been used in several studies and was proven accurate and reliable .",
    "it properly treats thermal fluctuations and disorder effects such as localization and percolation physics .",
    "one can for instance find detailed discussions in refs .",
    "a summary of the sc - lrpa procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as mentioned previously ,",
    "one of the great advantages of the sc - lrpa is to allow a direct calculation of the critical temperature .",
    "indeed , one can derive a semi - analytical expression for t@xmath24 that reads @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 f@xmath28 s depend on the reduced local magnetizations @xmath29 that are calculated self - consistently .",
    "in the limit of vanishing magnetization one finds the following set of equations , @xmath30 the nature of the magnon modes ( localized / extended ) is explicitly taken into account in the expression of t@xmath31 ( eq.([tc1 ] ) and ( [ tc2 ] ) ) .",
    "the accuracy and reliability of the sc - lrpa to handle both thermal fluctuations and disorder ( localization , percolation ) has been often addressed by direct comparison with monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "the agreement was systematically very good , the critical temperatures calculated by both methods usually differ by less than 10@xmath32 .",
    "for instance , in the case of 5@xmath32 doped gaas , using the same couplings , monte carlo calculations have lead respectively to 137 k @xcite and 110 k @xcite ( error bars were not given but should be at least of the order of 10@xmath32 ) , whilst the sc - lrpa value is 132 @xmath33 k. the use of the two step approach combining first principle calculations of the magnetic couplings and sc - lrpa treatment of the effective diluted heisenberg hamiltonian is a tool of choice .",
    "however , due to the complexity and material specific nature of first principle calculations , it remains difficult to discern the relevant parameters that govern the physical features in various diluted magnetic semiconductors . a suitable minimal model allowing a coherent and consistent picture of the physics in these materials is needed . in the next section",
    "we introduce such a model , the v - j hamiltonian .",
    "it captures most of the relevant features in dilute magnets .",
    "it continuously shows how the couplings change from rkky nature in ii - vi mn doped compounds such as ( zn , mn)te or ( cd , mn)te to double exchange type in ( ga , mn)n .",
    "we will see that ( ga , mn)as is located near the metal to insulator transition and the resonant effects due to the position of the mn acceptor level is responsible for the highest curie temperature observed in this family of materials .",
    "the aim of this section is to compare ( i ) ab initio , ( ii ) model based calculations and ( iii ) experimental data .",
    "it will be seen that the non perturbative v - j model @xcite provides naturally a coherent and unified picture of the physics ( magnetism and transport ) in dms . as mentioned in the introduction part , in zener mean field theory",
    "the focus is put on the realistic description of the host band structure ( kohn - luttinger hamiltonian ) whilst the coupling between holes and localized spins ( s=5/2 ) of mn@xmath35 is treated perturbatively .",
    "in contrast , the key point of the v - j model ( defined below ) lies in the non - perturbative treatment of the impurity - hole coupling , while the details in the host band structure are ignored .",
    "as will be shown , it appears that the details of the band structure indeed play a secondary role .",
    "note , that the v - j model has been recently extended by including a more realistic description of the host band structure .",
    "this study has given further support to the validity of the model@xcite .",

    "j is the p - d coupling between the localized mn spin @xmath1 ( s=5/2 ) and the itinerant hole quantum spin @xmath42 .",
    "the on - site potential v@xmath28 results from the substitution of the host cation by the magnetic impurity .",
    "thus j@xmath28=p@xmath28j and v@xmath28=p@xmath28v where p@xmath28=1 if the site is occupied by an impurity , otherwise zero .",
    "the one band model contains 3 parameters only ( t , j , v ) .",
    "the hopping term has been set to t=0.7 ev ( to reproduce the typical vb bandwidth in iii - v / ii - vi semiconductors ) .",
    "j is of the order of 1 ev in both mn doped ii - vi and iii - v dms , thus , j has been set to 1.2 ev ( widely accepted value for mn doped gaas ) . in this way ,",
    "the remaining last parameter v fully characterizes a given mn doped compound .",
    "it is chosen in order to reproduce the specific position of the acceptor hybridized p - d state@xcite .",

    "the perturbative estimate ( zener mean field value ) of the spin splitting ( @xmath48js ) is found much smaller than that obtained from ab initio studies ( about 4 times smaller for the 5@xmath32 doped sample ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in the absence of v ( v=0 ) , @xmath49 is well approximated by @xmath45 .",
    "this regime corresponds to that of mn doped ii - vi compounds such as zn@xmath46mn@xmath47te , cd@xmath46mn@xmath47se for instance . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]-right , we compare the theoretical values of the curie temperature ( ab initio and v - j model ) to available experimental measurements .",

    "we have only chosen some values corresponding to annealed samples . because of the presence of compensating defects , as grown samples usually exhibit much smaller critical temperatures .",
    "this issue has been theoretically addressed in other papers @xcite .",
    "thus , an excellent quantitative agreement is found between v - j model and ab initio on one side and with the experimental data on the other side .",
    "this clearly supports the fact ( i ) that the v - j model captures the relevant and essential physics and ( ii ) that the key physical parameter is indeed the acceptor level position .",

    ", width=480 ]    we now proceed further and show that the agreement between v - j model and ab initio is not limited to the case of mn doped gaas only . for that purpose",
    "we have calculated t@xmath24 as a function of the acceptor level e@xmath52 ( by tuning v ) and compared it with existing ab initio calculations .",
    "the concentration of mn is set to @xmath44=0.05 and we have considered the case of optimally annealed systems , thus the hole density is set to @xmath51 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "regarding the ab initio results , the @xmath44-coordinate is the measured or calculated mn acceptor level in the compound .",
    "we observe that the v - j calculated t@xmath24 increases rapidly with increasing e@xmath52 till it reaches a maximum and then decreases .",
    "note that the rapid increase of t@xmath24 occurs on a very short energy scale .",
    "after the maximum , we observe two regimes : first t@xmath24 decreases rapidly till e@xmath52 @xmath53 and then the decay slope becomes significantly reduced .",
    "the maximum of the curie temperature which is about 125@xmath54 is reached for e@xmath52 @xmath55 .",
    "remarkably , this acceptor level energy coincides almost exactly with that of mn doped gaas ( measured value is 110  mev ) .",
    "thus the v - j model explains for the first time why among ii - vi and iii - v magnetic impurity doped semiconductors the highest measured t@xmath24 is that of mn doped gaas . in this figure",
    ", we also see the very good quantitative agreement between the v - j calculated critical temperatures and that obtained from ab initio based calculations .",
    "the reason of this maximum is the fact that the couplings are optimal ( resonant effects ) when the acceptor level is not too far and not too close to the top of the valence band",
    ". when the acceptor level is too small or vanishes ( e@xmath52 @xmath56 0 ) the couplings are rkky like ( case of mn doped ii - vi ) this leads to small t@xmath24 ( 1 - 2 k ) or eventually spin glass phase because of the frustration effects .",
    "as we increase e@xmath52 the couplings rapidly loose their oscillating character and become more and more ferromagnetic , thus t@xmath24 increases until it reaches its maximum . afterwards ,",
    "when the acceptor level becomes larger and larger the ferromagnetic couplings becomes shorter range ( double exchange regime ) , thus leading to a suppression of ferromagnetism .",

    "we will focus on the case of mn doped gaas since , to our knowledge , no experimental data are available for the other compounds . for this purpose",
    "we have calculated the dynamical spectral function that provides deeper insight into the underlying spin dynamics .",

    "the mn - mn couplings are those obtained from local spin density approximation calculations ( see ref . ) .",
    "in contrast to what one usually observes in weakly disordered magnetic systems , in the dilute mn doped gaas , well - defined excitations exist only in a restricted region of the brillouin zone centered around the @xmath65-point ( q = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ) . as we move away from the center of the brillouin zone , the width of the excitation increases rapidly . beyond",

    "initio calculations give respectively 120 @xmath71 30 mev@xmath72 and 130@xmath71 30 mev@xmath72 .",
    "note that , the uncertainty in the theoretical values result from the sensitivity to the magnetic couplings at relatively high distances between localized spins .",
    "thus the agreement is still reasonably good for this concentration as well .",
    "we have demonstrated that we can describe quantitatively the physics of dms , both transport and magnetism , within a coherent picture .",
    "the minimal v - j hamiltonian is the missing link that bridges the gap between complex and material specific first principle studies and model approaches .",
    "it has been shown that the physics is essentially controlled by the position of the p - d acceptor level with respect to the top of the valence band .",
    "this model approach continuously explain the change in the nature of the couplings .",
    "the two extreme regimes , rkky in mn doped ii - vi such as ( zn , mn)te and double exchange like in ( ga , mn)n , are described within the same picture .",
    "the agreement between ab initio , v - j model and experimental data are impressive ( curie temperatures , low energy magnetic excitation spectrum ) .",
    "the v - j model clearly explains the reason why mn doped gaas exibits the highest critical temperature among both ii - vi and iii - v compounds and its proximity to metal - insulator transition .",
    "hence , this model provides an efficient tool to find other pathways towards room temperature ferromagnetism , such as the influence of correlated disorder and nanostructuration of the materials for instance .",
