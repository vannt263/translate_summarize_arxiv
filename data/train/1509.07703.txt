    "the model also discussed a possible role of reconnection outflow assuming alfvnic velocity , @xmath156 . in our calculations ,",
    "a relativistic outflow was observed only locally and intermittently ; the averaged outflow velocity was a sub - relativistic velocity up to @xmath157 even in the high-@xmath15 regime , which is commonly seen in the relativistic mhd reconnection resulted from the tearing instability .",
    "if we see a smaller scale , the collisionless plasma regime will appear in which the outflow velocity is alfvn velocity in the high-@xmath15 regime   @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a new scenario for the gamma - ray bursts powered by turbulent reconnection based on kink instability of relativistically magnetized jets  @xcite .",
    "in this model , the authors considered a turbulence induced by the kink instability , and applied it to the turbulent reconnection model .",
    "they showed that their model can provide a good fit to the dynamics of grbs .",
    "note that this model may also be able to be applied to agn jets , which may result in a different condition from equations ( [ eq:5.3 ] ) .",
    "+   + _ general remarks _ + finally",
    ", we give several comments which can be applied to any phenomena in general if turbulent reconnection works .",
    "first , our results , such as the figure 2 , indicates that the maximum reconnection rate is obtained when @xmath158 .",
    "assuming the alfvnic mode , @xmath159 , where @xmath24 and @xmath160 are the background and fluctuation of magnetic field , respectively , @xmath161 is the fluctuation velocity perpendicular to @xmath24 , we can expect that the turbulent reconnection is efficient if an observed magnetic fluctuation of some phenomena is around @xmath162 . in addition",
    ", we can expect that such a low magnetic fluctuation will allow a high polarization degree of synchrotron radiation observed by @xcite .",
    "second , it is well - known that magnetic reconnetion is also related to particle acceleration .",
    "for example , many particle - in - cell simulations indicates that the energy spectrum index obtained in relativistic collisionless pair - plasma reconnection is around @xmath163  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that the turbulent reconnection is also a location of the first - order fermi process , and they obtained a little softer energy spectrum index , @xmath164 .",
    "non - thermal particle energy index is directly related to the observed synchrotron spectrum , and the above energy spectrum index may be useful tool to determine the location of turbulent reconnection .",
    "applications of turbulent reconnection model to some agns are provided in @xcite .",
    "more comprehensive discussion of recent observations is given in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we investigated turbulent reconnection in relativistic plasmas from the matter dominated to poynting dominated cases using the relativistic resistive mhd model .",
    "the results show that the turbulence can enhance magnetic reconnection even in relativistic plasmas , and can be a candidate for a fast reconnection process .",
    "we found the reconnection rate in turbulence shows the following 3 characteristic phase depending on the velocity of the injected turbulence : ( 1 ) lv99 region ( incompressible turbulence ) ; ( 2 ) saturation region giving maximum rate ; ( 3 ) reducing due to the compressibility .",
    "the saturation occurs when the compressible component become dominant , typically around @xmath165 at which the maximum reconnection rate is about @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that the lv99 expressions for incompressible fluid should be modified to account for compressibility as we have done in equations ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4.4 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite showed that dilatation of fluid , @xmath114 , reduces the effective energy cascade rate @xmath116 .",
    "all of our numerical results showed dilatation , and the reconnection rates are indeed reduced .",
    "this indicates that the turbulent reconnection rate may become larger than lv99 s prediction if compression of the turbulence occurs , such as the mhd turbulence driven by collisions of magnetized blobs  @xcite .",
    "finding a fast reconnection process is one of the most important topics in plasma physics , and a considerable number of studies have been conducted on it for a long time .",
    "turbulence is a very general process in high - reynolds number plasmas , so that turbulent reconnection can appear in many kinds of phenomena , such as astrophysical phenomena , nuclear fusion , and laser plasma . in particular , our work investigated the extension of turbulent reconnection to relativistic plasma with compressible turbulence , which allows us to apply this process to many high energy astrophysical phenomena , such as flares in pulsar wind nebulae , gamma ray bursts , and relativistic jets .",
