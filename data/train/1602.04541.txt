    "besides precise coherent control , to be able to prepare initial states of quantum systems accurately is also one of essential requirements for quantum information processing .",
    "most of the state preparations implemented in quantum experiments assume having ideal ( closed ) quantum coherent systems .",
    "however , almost every quantum system interacts inevitably with its surrounding environment ( bath ) resulting in an equilibrium or correlated system - environment state before any operation or measurement onto the system is performed @xcite .",
    "thus how to prepare a desired initial system state from an equilibrium or correlated system - environment state becomes an important and practical issue @xcite .",
    "in addition to its effect on the system dynamics , system - environment correlation also plays a vital role in quantum dynamical maps and open - system state distinguishability @xcite .",
    "the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system with a tensor product ( factorized ) initial system - environment state is a completely positive map .",
    "completely positive maps are appealing because they form a time - dependent semigroup and have a simple mathematical structure that the composition of two completely positive maps is also a completely positive map @xcite .",
    "this makes the initial factorization of the joint system - environment state an attractive and commonly adopted initial condition when studying the dynamics of an open quantum system .",
    "however , when the system - environment interaction is not very weak , the initial system - environment correlation may have an appreciable effect on the open system dynamics .",
    "references @xcite have investigated the role of initial system - environment correlations on the reduced system dynamics with a system state initially prepared by a projective ( selective ) measurement on the system alone .",
    "the system - environment state before the projective measurement is a total thermal equilibrium state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total hamiltonian , including the system - environment interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the projective measurement is assumed to be instantaneous such that the ( unnormalized ) environment state after the measurement collapses to @xmath2 , conditioned on the projected system state @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement has the effect of removing the system - environment correlation , and this measurement - induced factorized initial system - environment state has been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , if the post - measurement system state evolution is of interest or concern , the measurement made upon the system is usually nondestructive and indirect and thus takes some finite time to project the system state to the desired state @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "unless the measurement is very strong , the system and environment will evolve away from the total equilibrium state when the measurement is completed . in this case , the post - measurement density matrix of the environment is no longer @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "the system state preparation by projective measurement with the above instantaneously measurement - induced factorized system - environment state is an idealization .",
    "we note again that the subsequent system evolution is dependent on the initial system - environment correlations , but the initial system - environment state used for the investigations @xcite is , however , a factorized state .    in this paper , we investigate an alternative method for state preparation by applying an external field .",
    "we use the time evolution of the trace distance @xcite between two reduced system states of an open quantum system as a measure of the effect of initial correlations .",
    "the time evolution of the trace distance between the quantum states evolving from two kinds of initial states , a correlated total equilibrium state ( or gibbs state ) and its uncorrelated marginal state for an open qubit system with a week external driving field was calculated by the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . the open quantum system model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite before the application of an external driving field is a pure - dephasing spin - boson model in which the system operator coupling to the environment commutes with the system hamiltonian .",
    "however , for the purpose of accurate state preparations in open quantum systems , fast control and thus stronger fields beyond the rwa may be necessary",
    ". the main purposes of this paper is to investigate under what conditions the initial factorization approximation of the system - environment state is valid and how different the system dynamics is when the initial system - environment correlation is taken into account , especially for state preparation via applying an external field .",
    "we will also investigate the conditions for the breakdown of the rwa and the onset of non - rwa corrections for state preparation .",
    "we go beyond the limitations or approximations imposed in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering a non - commuting spin - boson model in an external driving field without making the rwa .",
    "the method presented here to derive the time - nonlocal master equation to second order in the system - bath interaction and to take the initial correlation into account is based on the nakajima - zwanzig projection operator technique @xcite . to deal with the application of a strong external field , an efficient formulation of introducing auxiliary density matrices in an extended liouville space to transform the time - nonlocal time - ordered integro - differential master equation into a set of time - local coupled differential equations is employed .",
    "we find that when the driving field strength is above a certain value the rwa becomes invalid and when the system - environment interaction is above a certain value , the initial system - environment correlation become important to the open system dynamics .",
    "the detailed values in relation to the fidelity or error of the state preparation will be discussed and presented .",
    "we will also investigate the effects of the system - environment correlation established after the state preparation on the subsequent field - free system evolution .",
    "the dynamics of the trace distance has been used to study non - contractivity and non - markovianity @xcite , both of which could be induced by initial correlations .",
    "we find that the dynamics of the trace distances between these correlated states and between these correlated states and their corresponding factorized states in the subsequent field - free evolutions exhibit diverse behaviors .",
    "so another purpose of the paper is to introduce an upper bound and a lower bound for the trace distance within our perturbation formalism to describe the various behaviors of the dynamics of the trace distance .",
    "these bounds that we introduce are much more computable than similar bounds in the literature @xcite .",
    "these bounds in turn give a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the increase of the trace distance and are related to the witnesses of non - markovianity and initial system - bath correlations .",

    "<S> is introduced to describe the dynamics of the non - markovian open quantum system in the presence of a strong field and an initial system - environment correlation . by using the time evolutions of the population difference , the state trajectory in the bloch sphere representation and the trace distance between two reduced system states of the open quantum system </S>",
    "<S> , the effect of initial system - environment correlations on the preparation of a system state is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an upper bound and a lower bound for the trace distance within our perturbation formalism to describe the diverse behaviors of the dynamics of the trace distance between various correlated states after the system state preparation . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds that are much more computable than similar bounds in the literature give a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the increase of the trace distance and are related to the witnesses of non - markovianity and initial system - bath correlation . </S>"
