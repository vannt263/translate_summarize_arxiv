    "from a long time it is believed that , due to the van der waals nature of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , nuclear matter is likely to exhibit a liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "while such a phase transition was predicted within various models , from the experimental point of view so far things are rather inconclusive .",
    "the reasons are related to both the inherent difficulties of backtracking the freeze - out stage and the lack of any rigorous mathematical apparatus permitting the unambiguous determination of a liquid - gas phase transition when it exists in experimental data .",
    "some years ago , the general conviction was that the experimental measurement of the nuclear caloric curve could give a definite answer to this problem . neglecting the weaknesses of each of the `` thermometers '' tested with that occasion ,",
    "there is one fundamental barrier preventing the inference of a first order phase transition from any experimentally obtained caloric curve even with back - bending shape : the experimentally obtained microcanonical systems follow an _ unknown _ path in the excitation energy ( @xmath0)- freeze - out volume ( @xmath1 ) plane @xcite . _",
    "even _ if the experimental path intersects the coexistence region the phase transition may remain unrevealed in the caloric curve @xcite . for overcoming that situation",
    "it was proposed that the heat capacity being a quantity _ independent _ on the experimental path but depending on the _ local _ freeze - out constrain could give precise information concerning the occurrence of the transition @xcite .",
    "more exactly , _ if _ the experimental path is intersecting the spinodal region of the system s phase diagram , this would be signaled by a negative value of the heat capacity .",
    "an analytical heat capacity formula was proposed with that occasion and was subsequently employed in investigating the experimental data obtained by the multics - miniball collaboration occasion with which negative branches of the heat capacity curves were identified @xcite .",
    "the formula was further applied on the indra data with the same success @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that though formally correctly deduced , this formula is based on unevaluated terms ( such as the microcanonical temperature ( @xmath2 ) or the heat capacity ( @xmath3 ) corresponding to a partial energy of the system ( @xmath4 ) ) which further imply a chain of assumptions and approximations is deduced from the @xmath5 dependence which results in even larger deviations . ] resulting in ( unpredicted ) deviations from the exact results .",
    "the above matters motivated us to draw the attention in the present paper on an alternate way to calculate the microcanonical heat capacity of nuclear systems proposed in ref .",
    "as will be further shown this method is _ exact _ , model independent , simply applicable and does not depend on any unevaluated term .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows : section 2 gives a brief review of the model used for illustrating the paper s ideas .",
    "section 3 investigates on the possible signals one can ( experimentally ) get about a possible liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "microcanonical formulas for temperature , heat capacity and second - order derivative of the entropy versus energy are deduced for various conservation options in section 4 .",
    "examples for the functioning of the above - mentioned formulas are given in section 5 .",
    "the same quantities are deduced in section 6 for the case in which only a percent of the total number of fragments are available per event .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 7 .",
    "for testing the paper s argumentation we use the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation model proposed in ref .",
    "the model concerns the disassembly of a statistically equilibrated nuclear source @xmath6 ( i.e. the source is defined by the parameters : mass number , atomic number , excitation energy , and freeze - out volume respectively ) ; its basic hypothesis is equal probability between all configurations @xmath7 ( the mass number , the atomic number , the excitation energy , the position and the momentum of each fragment @xmath8 of the configuration @xmath9 , composed of @xmath10 fragments ) which are subject to standard microcanonical constraints : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath0 - constant ; integration over the fragments momenta can be analytically performed in the expression of the total number of states , then one works in the smaller configuration space : @xmath15 ; a metropolis - type simulation is employed for determining the average value of any system observable .",
    "function of the desired conservation restriction ( @xmath16 ) level ( @xmath17 ) one can write : @xmath18 with @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the inertial tensor of the system . here",
    "@xmath26 denotes the system s hamiltonian : @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the coulomb interaction between fragments @xmath8 and @xmath30 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the internal excitation and the binding energy of fragment @xmath8 ) . in the standard version of the model fragments",
    "are idealized as nonoverlapping hard spheres placed into a spherical recipient ; intersection between fragments and the `` recipient s '' wall is also forbidden .",
    "we call this freeze - out hypothesis ( i ) . in a simplified version ,",
    "( ii ) , one can further perform an approximate integration over the position variables as in @xcite and get the extra factor : @xmath33 in the expression of the statistical weight of a configuration @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath35 ) , where @xmath36 stands for the volume of the nuclear system at normal nuclear matter density . in this version of the model",
    "the wigner seitz approximation is used for the interfragment coulomb interaction .",
    "when angular momentum conservation is also considered , @xmath37 is approximated by the quantity corresponding of a sphere of volume @xmath1 uniformly filled with nuclear matter of density @xmath38 .",
    "the latter version is computationally faster and provides a different freeze - out perspective ( i.e. spherical hard - core interaction is missing ) .",
    "which are the echos one can experimentally get from a liquid - gas phase transition ? for answering this question one should first define the liquid - gas phase transition in _",
    "_ extensive _ or _ nonextensive _ systems .",
    "this matter was recently addressed in @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that the techniques usually employed for very large systems work for the case of finite extensive or nonextensive systems as well .",
    "namely , it was shown that curves like @xmath39 ( here @xmath40 is an extensive variable , @xmath41 is the @xmath40 s conjugate and @xmath42 is another intensive variable ) have the property of revealing the phase transition ( even in small and nonextensive systems ) by bending backwards .",
    "the microcanonical isobaric caloric curves or isothermal pressure versus volume curves are natural examples for the physical situation under study .",
    "the probability distributions of an isobaric canonical ensemble proved to be a precious tool for identifying the phase transition when it exists ( by exhibiting a double peaked structure ) and for constructing the corresponding @xmath43 and @xmath44 curves .",
    "reasons lay in the simple expression of the probability of a state with excitation energy @xmath0 and volume @xmath1 in a constant pressure canonical ensemble characterized by the parameters @xmath45 ( canonical pressure ) and @xmath46 ( inverse of the canonical temperature ) : @xmath47 leading to the expression of the microcanonical entropy ( @xmath48 ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the constant pressure canonical partition function . starting from their definitions ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 )",

    "the double peaked structure points the presence of a first order phase transition .",
    "both isothermal and isobaric paths are intersecting the two peaks of the distribution and also a third saddle - like point . the corresponding @xmath43 and @xmath44 curves are plotted in the lateral panels with thick lines .",
    "they both present a backbending region indicating the phase transition .     and",
    "@xmath45 are labeled on the picture .",

    "height=377 ]    while such constructions can be simply performed in theoretical models , experimentally one can usually only access microcanonical ensembles ( due to the sorting of events in bins of @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , it is widely believed that the events corresponding to a microcanonical ensemble at a given @xmath0 have a fluctuating volume at freeze - out - somewhat similar to the case of a volume constraint @xmath63 proposed in ref .",
