    "<S> we report new results on identified ( anti)proton and charged pion spectra at large transverse momenta ( 3@xmath0@xmath1@xmath010  gev/@xmath2 ) from cu+cu collisions at @xmath3  =  200  gev using the star detector at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . </S>",
    "<S> this study explores the system size dependence of two novel features observed at rhic with heavy ions : the hadron suppression at high-@xmath1  and the anomalous baryon to meson enhancement at intermediate transverse momenta . </S>",
    "<S> both phenomena could be attributed to the creation of a new form of qcd matter . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here bridge the system size gap between the available @xmath4 and au+au data , and allow the detailed exploration for the on - set of the novel features . </S>",
    "<S> comparative analysis of all available 200  gev data indicates that the system size is a major factor determining both the magnitude of the hadron spectra suppression at large transverse momenta and the relative baryon to meson enhancement .    </S>",
    "<S> differential studies of identified particle production in nucleus - nucleus collisions provide an experimental means to probe the different stages of the collision evolution and explore the properties of the created medium . </S>",
    "<S> spectral measurements at high transverse momenta are of special interest , for the following reasons . in elementary collisions , hard partonic scatterings are known to produce jets of particles originating from the fragmentation of a high-@xmath1  quark or gluon . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral distributions of particles in transverse momentum from such interactions are measured experimentally and are reasonably well understood in terms of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these hard scatterings occur in heavy - ion collisions as well , but their resulting distributions are found to be modified due to interactions with the medium and the resulting energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> thus , understanding modifications to the high-@xmath1  particle distributions is an important step towards understanding the partonic energy loss mechanisms within the medium  @xcite .    to study the effects of parton - medium interaction on particle production in heavy - ion collisions we compare the production cross - sections measured in aa to the equivalent measurements in @xmath4 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> following the expectation that the particle production in heavy - ion collisions at high-@xmath1  is determined by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon inelastic collisions we define the nuclear modification factor , @xmath5 , as the ratio ( eq .  ( [ eqn : raa ] ) ) of particle yields measured in aa to the cross - sections measured in @xmath4 collisions scaled by the corresponding number of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath6 from a monte carlo glauber model calculation  @xcite . for the unmodified particle production in aa collisions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is exactly unity , whilst @xmath5@xmath01 indicates _ suppression _ and @xmath7 _ </S>",
    "<S> enhancement_.    @xmath8    the @xmath5 measured in @xmath9+au and peripheral au+au collisions exhibits an enhanced particle production which is believed to occur due to multiple nucleon scatterings within the colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this `` initial '' state effect is known as the cronin effect  @xcite . meanwhile , in central au+au collisions , @xmath5 at high-@xmath10 indicates that the particle production is strongly suppressed ( by about a factor of 5 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this `` final '' state effect has been attributed to the partonic energy loss in an opaque colored medium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , neither of the two effects is sufficiently understood and both require further experimental and theoretical study . </S>",
    "<S> the differential analysis presented here explores the system size effects on parton propagation through the medium to further evaluate the mechanisms of parton / medium interactions .        to provide additional constraints and systematic understanding of the measurements in very light ( @xmath9+au ) and heavy ( au+au ) collision systems we present the key studies at the intermediate ( cu+cu ) system at the same incident energy ( @xmath11  gev ) , bridging the gap between the two extremes . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements may provide quantitative understanding of the partonic energy loss and its system size dependence . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is expected that the identified particle measurements provide information on color - charge effects within the mechanism of jet quenching . </S>",
    "<S> although experimental discrimination between quark and gluon jet fragmentation on event - by - event basis is difficult , it can be addressed statistically by exclusive analysis of proton ( or baryon ) and pion ( meson ) production . </S>",
    "<S> we are utilizing the idea that the baryon to meson ratio is found higher in gluon jets compared to quark jets  @xcite . identified proton and </S>",
    "<S> pion measurements from @xmath4 collisions concur with this picture  @xcite , as well as direct measurements of baryon and meson production in quark and gluon jets  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , identified particle measurements at high-@xmath1  can then be used to analyze gluon and quark propagation through the medium and to probe the color - charge differences of energy loss  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> additionally , systematic studies of identified particle production in cu+cu can shed new light on the anomalous enhancement of baryons with respect to mesons observed at intermediate transverse momenta ( @xmath12@xmath0@xmath1@xmath06  gev/@xmath2 ) in au+au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is not consistent with the extrapolated values from the measurements in @xmath4 collisions and can not be explained by cold nuclear matter effects . at present , the preferred baryon over meson production at intermediate @xmath1  could be described by two very different considerations . </S>",
    "<S> the first model assumes coalescence and recombination , which demands a shift of baryon yields to higher momenta relative to meson yields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second model evokes an interplay of the flow effects in the radially expanding medium with the jet fragmentation  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> identified ( anti)proton and charged pion spectra are systematically explored with regard to the system size with the smaller cu+cu colliding system at @xmath3=  200  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality dependence of high-@xmath1  hadron production and the @xmath1  dependence of baryon to meson ratios in cu+cu data are compared to the au+au system as well as to @xmath4 collisions at the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> this allows gaining a greater understanding of _ peripheral _ collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the size of cu nuclei is ideally suited to explore the turn - on of the high-@xmath1  suppression bridging the gap between @xmath4 , @xmath9+au and peripheral au+au data in terms of system size and nuclear matter .    the cu+cu data used in this analysis were recorded by the star experiment during run 5 at rhic . here </S>",

    "<S> this difference is the dominant systematic uncertainty on particle spectra . </S>",
    "<S> an additional systematic error of 5% resultant from the uncertainty in the single - particle efficiency determination is added in quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> the total systematic error for pion spectra ranges from 9% ( at 3  gev/@xmath2 ) to 13% ( at 10  gev/@xmath2 ) . for protons , </S>",
    "<S> the error ranges from 21% ( at 3  gev/@xmath2 ) to 23% ( at  6  gev/@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these uncertainties are similar to the earlier evaluation from au+au data analysis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> systematic uncertainties from other possible sources such as the momentum resolution ( studied by embedding ) and the uncertainty in determination of the centroid position ( within the particle identification procedure ) are negligible . the corrected transverse momentum spectra for @xmath21 and ( anti)protons at @xmath3=200  gev are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ] @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the reach in transverse momentum is limited only by the available statistics . </S>",
    "<S> additional @xmath1  reach for pion identification is due to a larger separation from the kaon peak ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : ratios ] shows @xmath35 and @xmath36 ratios in cu+cu data at @xmath3=200  gev for the four centrality bins . </S>",
    "<S> the data show no systematic trends versus centrality within uncertainties , and a weak ( if any ) decreasing @xmath37 with transverse momentum ( as observed in au+au collisions  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to improve the statistical uncertainties in the following discussion , data are averaged over particle charge .            </S>",
    "<S> the spectral data alone can convey only a limited message . </S>",
    "<S> to delve into properties of the resultant data , ratios are taken . </S>",
    "<S> the first such ratio is termed the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath5 ) , defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : raa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pion spectra are suppressed in the most central ( _ head - on _ ) cu+cu data at @xmath3=200  gev ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pionraa ] ) . for the peripheral ( _ glancing _ ) </S>",
    "<S> collisions , a small enhancement is observed . to expose the features of the modifications of the hadron spectra in cu+cu and au+au collisions we study @xmath5  as a function of the amount of matter participating in the collisions . </S>",
    "<S> for both systems @xmath5  is evaluated within several fractional cross - section bins and as a function of the number of participating nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : pionraa ]  ( _ a _ ) shows the results of this comparative analysis using the most central 0 - 12% ( open squares ) and mid - peripheral 40 - 60% ( open circles ) au+au data . </S>",
    "<S> for the most central events the suppression level is found to be different between the systems . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant spectra from au+au collisions are more suppressed than in cu+cu data . according to the glauber calculation </S>",
    "<S> the mid - central ( 20 - 40% ) cu+cu collisions ( closed circles ) and mid - peripheral ( 40 - 80% ) au+au data ( open circles ) have similar numbers of participating nucleons ( see appendix a for details ) . for this selection of centralities within the two systems we find that numerical values of @xmath5  agree within the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement suggests a correlation of the suppression with the initial volume of the collision system .        in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pionraa ]  ( _ b _ ) we present the @xmath1  averaged @xmath5  for pions ( 5@xmath0@xmath1@xmath08  gev/@xmath2 ) as a function of the number of participating nucleons calculated for both cu+cu and au+au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between au+au ( open circles ) and cu+cu ( closed circles ) is striking and demonstrates that the nuclear modification factor for pions is a smooth function of the number of participating nucleons ( independent of the collision system ) .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we explore the systematics of baryon production in cu+cu and au+au systems by comparing the @xmath5  for protons and anti - protons . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : protonraa ]  ( _ a _ ) shows the @xmath5  distributions averaged over @xmath38 and @xmath39 for four centrality bins of cu+cu events . </S>",
    "<S> the data at hand does not differentiate if collision volume ( @xmath40 ) or fractional cross - section effects are driving the high-@xmath1  suppression for baryons due to the larger systematic uncertainties for ( anti)proton measurements . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we observe that proton production in the peripheral cu+cu events is consistent with binary scaling expectations , and the suppression is setting in as one progresses from the peripheral to central events . </S>",
    "<S> an overall similar centrality dependence was observed between the au+au and cu+cu data at the same energy ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : protonraa ]  ( _ b _ ) ) , albeit cu+cu integrated @xmath5  values seem lower than the respective au+au data points . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the systematic errors are uncorrelated between the systems , and both measurements are similar within the experimental uncertainties .    </S>",
    "<S> the similarity between the different systems at the same number of participants is also evident in other aspects of the data at lower @xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the smooth dependence of the nuclear modification factor could be interpreted as a consequence of medium induced energy loss of partons traversing the hot and dense medium . for the smaller systems sizes , either peripheral au+au or cu+cu data , the path length traversed is smaller ( on average ) than for the larger system ( central au+au ) . as observed in the data , </S>",
    "<S> a smaller energy loss is thus predicted  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> another dramatic effect observed in au+au data is the relative enhancement of protons to pions in the intermediate-@xmath1  region as compared to @xmath4 and @xmath41 collisions  @xcite as well as for other baryon to meson ratios  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is found to be strongly dependent on the centrality of the collision , as illustrated in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : bmratio ] . </S>",
    "<S> the most peripheral a+a data is shown to exhibit little or no enhancement in this ratio , with respect to @xmath4 collisions at the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> a similar increasing trend of favorable baryon production with centrality is observed in the cu+cu collision system . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the enhancement is observed in the region @xmath1@xmath422  </S>",
    "<S> gev/@xmath2 in au+au , at a slightly lower transverse momentum than the range measured in this analysis . at higher transverse </S>",
    "<S> momenta the enhancement over @xmath4 collisions diminishes to the level expected from vacuum fragmentation .    </S>",
    "<S> the baryon to meson ratio @xmath43 in cu+cu and au+au collisions shows similar trends for an equivalent number of participating nucleons . to further quantify this observation fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bmratio ]  ( _ b _ ) shows the proton to pion ratio ( for hadrons with 3@xmath0@xmath1@xmath04  gev/@xmath2 ) measured in cu+cu and au+au collisions as a function of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this ratio is also sensitive to the initial volume of the collision system and exhibits the same quantitative @xmath40 dependence irrespective of the collision system .    </S>",
    "<S> as discussed earlier , it is found that in the kinematic range of our measurements baryons are produced predominantly from gluon fragmentation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus expected that an increase in the baryon to meson ratio in the intermediate- to high-@xmath1  range would be related to gluon sources . to explain the presented data one could consider , for example , that a gluon jet could be more easily propagated through the medium than a quark jet , leading to an increase in the number of protons in the intermediate-@xmath1  region . </S>",
    "<S> this , however contradicts theoretical predictions where an opposite effect was expected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , more gluon jets could be initially produced , or _ induced _ </S>",
    "<S> ( for example , in the radiative energy loss scenario ) , for the more central data . </S>",
    "<S> the latter appears to be the more plausible , as the highest  @xmath1  data exhibits little or no enhancement over the @xmath4 data , indicating a similar energy loss for gluons and quarks ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : bmratio ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternative approaches to explain the phenomenon observed in the data , have also been developed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the recombination / fragmentation picture of thermal / shower partons has had success at describing this in au+au data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further information on the relative energy loss of quark and gluon jets can be extracted from the data by comparing the nuclear modification factors of proton and pion data ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pionraa ]  and  [ fig : protonraa ] ) . at </S>",
    "<S> high-@xmath1  ( above 5  gev/@xmath2 ) , however , the two suppression factors are found to be the same within the systematic uncertainties , suggesting a similar energy loss of quark and gluon jets in cu+cu collisions .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> new results on high-@xmath1  identified pion and proton spectra are presented for several centrality bins in cu+cu collisions at @xmath3=200  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the data are found to exhibit similar systematic trends over a wide range of transverse momenta as au+au collisions at the same energy with a similar number of participants . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression pattern observed versus the number of participants in au+au data is followed by the cu+cu data to a large degree . </S>",
    "<S> the participant coverage in these cu+cu collisions is in a region where the suppression effects are turning on . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of the proton to pion ratio reveals similar systematic dependencies to that found in au+au data . specifically , the increase in proton yield at intermediate transverse momenta persists for the much smaller cu+cu system .    </S>",
    "<S> further studies have shown similar suppression of protons and pions at high-@xmath1 . within the context of the connection between the detected pions and protons and quark and gluon jets suggested in the introduction , </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate similar partonic energy loss for both gluons and quarks . the amount of energy loss suffered by the partons is found to be @xmath44  dependent . within the experimental uncertainties , the suppression for different collision species is found to be invariant for the same number of participants .    </S>",
