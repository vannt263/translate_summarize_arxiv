    "we present here the analysis of the 300 ks exposure of the chandra deep field south ( giacconi et al .",
    "2000 ; hereafter paper i ) which reaches an on  axis flux limit of @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 in the hard ( 210 kev ) and soft ( 0.52 kev ) bands respectively .",
    "this is a factor of two deeper than the exposure presented in paper i , and significantly deeper than the chandra field presented by mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the xmm observations of the lockman hole by hasinger et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "with this dataset we have a similarly large survey area and limiting flux to the chandra deep field north ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2000 ; 2001 ; brandt et al .",
    "results from the total exposure of one million seconds will be reported elsewhere ( rosati et al . 2001 ) .    with this new data we confirm several results that were derived in the initial 120 ks dataset , and extend our analysis by resolving a larger fraction of the soft and hard x  ray background .",
    "the larger number of source photons allows a more accurate determination of the average spectral properties of the sample .",
    "the general properties of the x - ray background are now well established .",
    "this paper focuses on the nature of the sources that make up the background , especially in the hard band , taking advantage of new measured redshifts .",
    "we currently have 86 spectroscopic identifications from the on  going observational campaign with the vlt . combining the x  ray and optical data",
    ", we can now study the intrinsic luminosities for a significant subset of sources , thus allowing for a characterization of the source population .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the data acquisition and analysis . in  3 we present the results of the analysis of the x  ray data . in ",
    "4 we discuss some of the characteristics of the observed sources using the optical information available , and discuss the possible implications of our findings .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) data presented here have been obtained by adding two exposures to the former 120 ks exposure described in paper i. the two new exposures were taken with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer  imaging ( acis  i ) detector at a temperature of -120 c. the first observation ( obs i d 441 ) was taken on 2000 - 5 - 27 , in the faint mode , for a total 60 ks exposure . the second observation ( obs i d 582 ) was taken on 2000 - 6 - 3/4 in the faint mode , for a total 120 ks exposure .",
    "the data were reduced using the same techniques already described in paper i ( ciao software release v1.5 , see http://asc.harvard.edu/cda ) .",
    "the most important difference is the lower temperature of the detector ( -120 c ) that requires a new set of quantum efficiency uniformity files . at the temperature of -120",
    "c the charge transfer inefficiency is largely reduced , and the effective area is greatly improved , especially in the hard band .    the data were filtered to include only the standard event grades 0,2,3,4 and 6 .",
    "all hot pixels and columns were removed .",
    "we removed the flickering pixels with more than two events contiguous in time , where a single time interval was set to 3.3 s. time intervals with background rates larger than @xmath19 @xmath20 over the quiescent value ( @xmath21 counts s@xmath2 per chip in the 0.310 kev band ) were removed .",
    "the 4 observations give a total exposure time of 303 ks .",
    "the four observations had different roll angles , enabling a total coverage of 0.1035 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the exposure time across the field varies from a maximum of 303 ks in the center to a minimum of 25 ks in the corners .",
    "the area covered by 303 ks of exposure is 0.0636 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the resulting exposure map is the sum of the exposure maps of the single observations weighted by the corresponding exposure times",
    ".    the detection strategy has been modified with respect to paper i for a faster detection algorithm , allowing a large number of simulations to be carried out .",
    "we used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on the 0.57 kev image rebinned by a factor of two , so that one image pixel corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "sextractor detection parameters were chosen as a result of simulations and we adopted a detection threshold of 2.4 , with a gaussian filter with 1.5 arcsec fwhm and a minimum area of 5 pixels .",
    "sextractor is not tailored for use with a very low and sparse background as in acis ",
    "we used a modified version of the program to allow an external map to be used as local background .",
    "the smoothed map of the background was computed from the data itself after the removal of the sources down to a very low threshold .",
    "this modified detection algorithm is several order of magnitude faster than the wavelet detector algorithm of rosati et al .",
    "( 1995 ) or wavdetect in the ciao software ( freeman et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the marx v3.0 simulator ( wise et al . 2000 ) was used to generate the photon distribution of sources drawn from an input logn ",
    "logs modeled on the observed one .",
    "sources were placed randomly on the acis detector , and each one of them has been simulated as a point source as defined in marx .",
    "four different observations with the same roll angles and exposure maps as the real observations are simulated for a given distribution of sources .",
    "the final event file is obtained by merging four event files .",
    "the sky background was created as a poisson realization of the observed background , which was obtained by removing all the detected sources from the real 300ks image .",
    "the same detection procedure was carried out with 100 simulations .",
    "we stress that each of these simulations includes all the details of a realistic observation , including the different orientation of the asymmetric psf , and the variations in the background due to the edges of the chips and to the removed columns .",
    "the only ingredient missing in the simulations are the presence of extended sources and the clustering of the point sources .",
    "both have a negligible impact on the efficiency of our detection procedure .",
    "we run our detection algorithm on the simulated fields and assessed the photometric and astrometric accuracy , completeness and spurious source contamination , as well as the sky coverage model by comparing the input and output logn  logs shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "simulations show that the detection efficiency of sextractor is comparable with that of the wavelet algorithm .",
    "moreover , our @xmath23 criterium allows a direct and simple definition of the sky coverage ( see section  3.2 ) to give accurate number counts .",
    "we measure the signal to noise ratio of all the candidate detections in the area of extraction of each source , which is defined as a circle of radius @xmath24 ( with a minimum of 5 pixels of radius ) .",
    "the fwhm is modeled as a function of the off - axis angle to reproduce the broadening of the psf . in each band",
    "a detected source has a @xmath25 within the extraction area of the image .",
    "here @xmath26 are the background counts found in an annulus with outer radius @xmath27 and an inner radius of @xmath28 , after masking out other sources , rescaled to the extraction region . a combined catalog",
    "is then produced matching the two .",
    "we stress that the condition of having @xmath29 in the extraction area corresponds to a high significance detection ( the faintest detected sources have more than 10 counts ) . here",
    "we used a threshold higher than the one used in paper i ( @xmath30 ) to reduce the number of spurious sources .",
    "our catalog now typically includes less than 5 spurious sources , as tested with simulations .",
    "source counts are measured with simple aperture photometry within @xmath31 in the soft and hard bands separately .",
    "simulations have shown that such aperture photometry leads to an underestimate of the source count rate by approximately @xmath32% ( see panel c of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we will correct such photometric bias before converting count  rates in energy flux .",
    "the count  rate to flux conversion factors in the 0.52 kev and in the 210 kev bands were computed using the response matrices .",
    "we quote the fluxes in the canonical 210 kev band , as extrapolated from counts measured from the 27 kev band , in order to have a direct comparison with the previous results .",
    "the conversion factors are @xmath33 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 per count s@xmath2 in the soft band , and @xmath34 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 per count @xmath35 in the hard band assuming a galactic absorbing column of @xmath36 @xmath3 and a photon index @xmath37 .",
    "the uncertainties in the conversion factors reflect the range of possible values for the effective photon index shown by the sources in our sample : @xmath38 .",
    "the conversion factors were computed at the aimpoint . before computing the energy flux ,",
    "the count rates must be corrected for vignetting and are converted to the count rates that would have been measured if the source were in the aimpoint . the correction is simply given by the ratio of the value of the exposure map at the aimpoint to the value of the exposure map at the source position .",
    "this is done separately for the soft and the hard band , using the exposure maps computed for energies of 1.5 kev and 4.5 kev .",
    "this procedure also accounts for the large variation in exposure time across the field of view .",
    "the optical counterparts of x  ray sources have been identified on deep r band images obtained with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph ( fors1 , appenzeller et al .",
    "1998 ) at vlt  antu .",
    "most of the area covered by the 4 chips of acis ",
    "i has been observed in r band with an exposure time ranging from 1.5 to 2 hours , in service observing mode on october 1999march 2000 .",
    "shallower exposures ( about 20 minutes ) have also been obtained for the outer regions covered by the acis ",
    "i chips at different roll angles .",
    "these images were reduced in the standard way ( prescan , bias , sky - flat and supersky correction ) , astrometrically and photometrically calibrated and then coadded using drizzling procedures .",
    "the depth of the coadded image is @xmath39 for the shallow part and @xmath40 for the deeper part of the coadded image ( at @xmath41 level within @xmath42 aperture ) .",
    "the psf in the final images is @xmath43 .",
    "the area covered by the deep r - band images has also been observed in i band , with 3 hours of exposure and a limiting magnitude of @xmath44 , with a psf in the final image of @xmath45 .    for those sources which do not fall in the area covered by fors1 images ,",
    "the optical identification has been performed on a b band image of 6.5 hours integration obtained during the commissioning phase of the wide field imager ( baade et al .",
    "1999 ) at the 2.2 mpa  eso telescope in january 1999 .",
    "the limiting magnitude is @xmath46 ( @xmath47 with a psf of @xmath48 .",

    "2001 ) .",
    "the optical spectroscopy of x  ray counterparts with @xmath49 is underway with fors1 at vlt  antu .",
    "so far , the optical spectra were obtained observing with the multislit mode on fors1 at vlt ",
    "antu on october 2730 , 2000 and november 2325 , 2000 . to date",
    ", we have obtained good s / n spectra for 86 sources , selected from a catalog which was constructed from the 300ks image .",
    "these redshifts are used in the following analysis .",
    "the list of redshifts will be presented with the complete catalog from the 1ms data in giacconi et al .",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) , and the detailed description of the optical spectroscopy will be presented in a future paper ( hasinger et al .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the x  ray spectral properties .",
    "we have measured the average stacked spectrum of the 197 sources of the total sample .",
    "the corresponding background was constructed using the stacked spectrum of all the background regions extracted around each source .",
    "the resulting photon files were scaled by the ratio of the total area of extraction of the sources and the corresponding area used for the background .",
    "such a procedure guarantees a correct background subtraction despite the non  uniformities of the instrumental background across acis ",
    "the ancillary response matrix for the stacked spectra was obtained from the counts  weighted average of the matrices from each of the single sources .",
    "each ancillary response matrix is composed of the sum of the matrices corresponding to that source in each single exposure , weighted by the corresponding exposure time .",
    "the same is done for the response matrices . in this way , we keep track in the most detailed way of the characteristics of the different regions and the different detector temperatures at the time of the observations .",
    "we used xspec v11.0 to compute the slope of a power law spectrum with galactic absorption , in the energy range 1.010 kev .",
    "we exclude energy bins below @xmath50 kev because the calibration is still uncertain below this energy .",
    "such uncertainty has a small effect on the average conversion factor , but can give wrong results on detailed fits . for a column density fixed to the galactic value @xmath51 @xmath3 , we obtained a photon index @xmath11 ( errors refer to the 90% confidence level ) with @xmath52 .",
    "the results of the spectral fit to the total sample of sources are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the average spectrum of the detected sources is consistent with the measured shape of the unresolved hard background @xmath53 , confirming previous findings with chandra ( paper i ; mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ) .    a more detailed view of the spectral properties as a function of the fluxes comes from the hardness ratio @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the net count rates in the hard ( 27 kev ) and the soft band ( 0.52 kev ) , respectively .",
    "the distributions of the hardness ratios as a function of the soft and hard flux are shown in figure [ fig3 ] . in both bands ,",
    "the number of hard sources increases at lower fluxes .",
    "this is particularly significant if we plot the hardness ratio as a function of the hard fluxes .",
    "the average @xmath57 ranges from @xmath58 for @xmath59 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 , to @xmath60 for @xmath61 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "such hardness ratio corresponds to an energy spectral index @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively . even if we have already resolved the majority of the 210 kev background , the remaining fraction is made by a population of sources with progressively harder spectra .",
    "there are 22 sources ( @xmath64% of the total sample ) which are observed only in the hard band plotted at @xmath65 , and 51 sources ( @xmath66 26% of the total sample ) which are observed only in the soft band plotted at @xmath67 .",
    "studies from asca suggest that each source with nuclear activity is emitting in both bands at some level : the soft emission is @xmath68% of the hard emission for the hardest sources ( della ceca et al .",
    "1999a ) .    in the framework of the unification model for the agns , we expect to detect most of these sources in the soft and hard band if we push the detection limit down to low fluxes .",
    "we study the stacked spectra of the only  soft and the only  hard subsamples , to determine the flux level at which the single sources can be detected in the hard and soft bands respectively . for the sources detected only in the soft",
    ", the stacked spectrum has an hardness ratio of @xmath69 and is well fitted by a power law with @xmath70 for a @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with the typical spectrum of unabsorbed typei agn , similar to the sources found at very high fluxes by asca .    for the source detected only in the hard band ,",
    "the hardness ratio of the cumulative spectrum is @xmath72 .",
    "the fit with an unabsorbed power law gives @xmath73 , but with @xmath74 .",
    "this indicates that a single power law is a bad fit and therefore intrinsic absorption is a necessary ingredient to describe the spectra of the faint , hardest sources .",
    "in fact , if we leave the local absorption free , we find @xmath75 @xmath3 , which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the galactic value , and a power law of @xmath76 ( errors correspond to the 90% confidence level ) .",
    "such level of absorption correspond to @xmath77 @xmath3 for @xmath78 .",
    "this results shows that the progessive hardening of the sources at faint fluxes is due to intrinsic absorption .",
    "moreover , the average hardness ratios derived for the two subsamples tell us that the average spectrum of the sources undetected in one of the two bands is similar to that of the other sources detected in both bands at low fluxes . in other words , we expect to detect most of them in a longer exposure .",
    "the average number of soft and hard counts for the sources detected in the hard or in the soft band only , is 3.8 and 4.1 respectively ( corresponding to a count rate of @xmath79 cts / s ) .",
    "the flux where the whole sample is detected in both the soft and the hard band will depend on the nature of the sources themselves .",
    "for example , the absorption detected in the only  hard subsample is already well in excess of @xmath80 @xmath3 . if the intrinsic absorption is rapidly increasing with decreasing flux , as predicted by some agn synthesis models ( see gilli , salvati & hasinger 2001 )",
    ", then the expected count rate of most of these hard sources can be much lower than the expected average @xmath81 cts / s and they could be undetectable in the soft band down to fluxes as low as @xmath82 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( see discussion in  5 ) .    in conclusion , at our present flux limits",
    ", we are still seeing significant differences in the soft and hard subsamples .",
    "these can result from an admixture of different classes of objects .",
    "this finding encourages us to push the flux detection threshold to the point where all the sources are detected in both bands .",
    "the value of such a flux can be much lower than expected depending on the intrinsic properties of the low  flux sources .",
    "this will be investigated with the total ( @xmath831ms ) exposure of the cdfs .",
    "we now calculate the effective sky coverage at a given flux which is defined as the area on the sky where a source with a given net count rate can be detected with a @xmath29 in the extraction region defined in  2.1 .",
    "the computation includes the effect of varying exposure , vignetting and point response function variation across the field .",
    "such a procedure has been tested extensively with simulations performed with marx v3.0 , and it has been shown to be accurate to within a few percent ( see panel d in figure [ fig1 ] ) . the sky coverage is given in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the step  like features are due to the large difference in the exposure across the field of view .    using the sky ",
    "coverage we can compute the number counts in the soft and hard bands . in the soft band , shown in figure [ fig5 ] , we find the chandra results in excellent agreement with rosat in the region of overlap @xmath84 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the chandra data extend the results to @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit to the soft sources gives @xmath85 where the errors are at 1 sigma .",
    "the confidence levels at 1 , 2 and 3 sigma for both slope and normalization are shown in the insert panel of figure [ fig5 ] . the clear flattening with respect to the bright counts by rosat ( @xmath86 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ) shown in paper i ( also found by mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ) is confirmed .",
    "the slope shows 2@xmath20 evidence of further flattening with respect to the value found in paper i. this difference may be partially due to the number of spurious sources and flickering pixels not removed in the previous data reduction , causing the soft number counts at the lowest fluxes to be overestimated by @xmath87% . to check",
    "if the number counts are flattening in the investigated flux range , we perform a fit with a double power law for the differential number counts .",
    "the fit is done on 4 parameters : faint  end normalization and slope , bright  end slope and flux where the break occurs .",
    "we find that the differential counts are well fitted by a power law which is consistent with the euclidean slope at the bright end and with a slope @xmath88 ( 1 sigma ) at the faint end , with a break at @xmath89 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "thus , below @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 , the slope of the cumulative number count is @xmath90 .",
    "such a significant flattening will be further tested on the data from the 1ms observation .",
    "we compared our logn  logs with the predictions of the agn population synthesis models described in gilli , salvati & hasinger ( 2001 ) .",
    "we consider their model b , where the number ratio r between absorbed and unabsorbed agns is assumed to increase with redshift from 4 , the value measured in the local universe , to 10 at @xmath91 , where r is unknown .",
    "this model was found to provide a better description of the x  ray constraints ( asca and rosat number counts , luminosity function and redshift distribution by rosat , see gilli , salvati & hasinger 2001 ) with respect to a standard model where r=4 at all redshifts .",
    "the value of r was independent of the luminosity and therefore a large population of obscured qsos is included in the model .",
    "such a model was originally calibrated to fit the background intensity measured by asca . in this paper ,",
    "the parameters of the agn x  ray luminosity functions assumed in the model b are recalibrated to fit the background intensity measured by heao1 .",
    "the predictions for the source counts ( short dashed line in figure [ fig5 ] ) are in very good agreement with the chandra logn - logs at all fluxes .",

    "the comparison with the unresolved soft x ",

    "1998 ) , we end up with a total contribution of @xmath98 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 deg@xmath10 for fluxes larger than @xmath99 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( which is our flux limit in the 12 kev band ) , corresponding to 81% of the unresolved value as measured by rosat . if we assume the unresolved value measured by asca ( which must be considered as a lower limit ) the resolved contribution amounts to 96% .",

    "the line in figure [ fig8 ] is the prediction from the model used in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "here we notice that at the very bright end our sample is dominated by few bright sources with a spectrum steeper than the rest of the sample , typical of the typei agns detected by asca at @xmath120 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ( which make about 30% of the hard background and have @xmath121 ) .",
    "this may have biased the average spectral slope of our total sample towards slightly higher values .",
    "for example , the average spectral slope in the lynx field , independently analyzed by some of us , in the same range of fluxes is @xmath122 ( 1 sigma error ) which is marginally flatter than @xmath11 found in the cdfs .",
    "we checked that using a varying @xmath123 , as shown in figure [ fig8 ] , does not alter the resulting logn ",
    "logs by more than a 5% increase in the normalization .",
    "the total contribution to the x - ray background changes even less , since the lower @xmath123 at low fluxes is compensated by the higher @xmath123 at high fluxes .",
    "we conclude that using an average @xmath37 to derive the hard fluxes from the net counts is justified",
    ". an interesting consequence of this analysis is that a fraction of at least @xmath124% of the unresolved hard xrb is still to be resolved at fluxes lower than @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the spectroscopic optical identification process of the x  ray sources described in this paper is still ongoing .",
    "spectra have been taken with the fors1 instrument on the vlt ut-1 in multislit mode . from about 130",
    "spectra taken , we obtained a total of 99 redshifts , of which we regard 86 as secure .",
    "the redshifts are distributed between @xmath125 and @xmath126 with 50 sources at @xmath127 and 36 at @xmath128 . in figure [ fig9 ]",
    "we plot the distribution as a function of redshift and hardness ratio .",
    "we notice a striking difference between the distribution of hard and soft sources .",
    "the large majority of the sources with @xmath129 appear at @xmath130 , most of them at @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , most of the sources with @xmath129 are identified as typeii agns from the presence of narrow lines .",
    "typei agns instead , show an average @xmath132 with a relatively narrow dispersion , and they are found in a broader range of redshift .",
    "only three sources have @xmath133 and @xmath134 , including an obscured qso at @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "this source is marked with an asterisk in figure [ fig9 ] and is studied in detail in norman et al .",
    ". the average hardness ratio of all sources at @xmath137 is @xmath132 .",
    "this result , if confirmed by the complete analysis of the sample , would indicate that the hardest sources contributing to the 210 kev background are typically typeii objects at @xmath127 , according to what has been found by barger et al .",
    "conversely , the most distant sources ( @xmath134 ) have an average @xmath138 and are prevalently typei objects . the dashed lines in figure [ fig9 ]",
    "show how the observed hardness ratio changes with redshift for a given intrinsic absorbing @xmath139 assuming a photon index @xmath140 .",
    "we note that @xmath57 is not a good tracer of intrinsic absorption especially at high @xmath141 .",
    "we can investigate in greater detail the nature of the hard sources .",
    "we selected a subsample of source with @xmath142 ( corresponding to an effective @xmath143 for a galactic @xmath139 ) .",
    "all the selected sources are included in the region with 300ks of exposure and have a hard flux lower than @xmath144 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the sources selected in this way contribute about 20 - 30% of the total x  ray background .",
    "a fit with an absorbed power law gives @xmath145 and @xmath146 @xmath3 ( 1 sigma errors ) .",
    "using an average redshift of @xmath147 as representative of the sources in the subsample , we find an average intrinsic absorption corresponding to @xmath148 @xmath3 with a similar @xmath123 .",
    "this confirms the presence of strong intrinsic absorption for the hardest sources detected at low fluxes .",

    "the distribution of luminosities emitted in the soft band with redshift is shown in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "this plot shows that in 300ks we have achieved a greater sensitivity than all previous surveys .",
    "the upper solid line corresponds to a sensitivity limit in flux of @xmath150 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 , that was the flux limit of the 120k exposure ( see paper i ) .",
    "most of the sources with @xmath129 appear to fall in the @xmath151 erg s@xmath2 range and are identified with typeii absorbed agns .",
    "data obtained with the hst observations of a small fraction of our field ( schreier et al . 2001 ) will address in detail the morphological properties of the optical counterparts .",
    "softer sources with @xmath152 appear to span the range from @xmath153 to @xmath154 erg s@xmath2 . at luminosities larger than @xmath155 erg s@xmath2",
    "these sources are mostly identified with typei agn . at the low luminosity end",
    ", several sources are detected only in the soft band ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "most of these objects are identified with galaxies at redshift less than @xmath156 with soft luminosities restricted to a range between @xmath157 and @xmath158 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this population of relatively nearby galaxies with soft x ",
    "ray spectra has been found also by hornschemeier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the chandra deep field north .    in the plot @xmath56 versus @xmath159 , where s is the x  ray flux in the soft band",
    "( see figure 7 of paper i ) this subsample appears to populate the low @xmath160 region at fluxes @xmath161 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "we can use a criterium defined in the @xmath56@xmath159 plane to isolate this soft , low luminosity population of sources .",
    "if we define a subsample requiring @xmath162 , @xmath163 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 , and @xmath164 , we find 18 sources . among these 18 sources ,",
    "10 have redshift , with an average value @xmath165 .",
    "the very high redshift sources with @xmath166 ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) have @xmath167 and are therefore excluded from this subsample . by visual inspection from the images in the @xmath159 and @xmath26 bands , at least 10 of these 18 sources appear clearly to be galaxies .",
    "if we fit their stacked spectrum with a power law , we find consistency with galactic absorption , and a spectral slope @xmath168 ( 90 % c.l . ) .",
    "if we repeat the fit with a thermal spectrum , we find a temperature of @xmath169 kev , which is too high to be produced by hot gas in the potential wells of galaxies .",
    "such an apparent temperature may be due to the contribution of low luminosity nuclear activity or a population of x  ray binaries .",
    "both fits have a @xmath170 .",
    "a better definition of the subsample will be available when the spectroscopic optical identification is completed .",
    "we detected x  ray sources down to a flux limit of @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 in the 0.52 kev soft band and @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 in the 210 kev hard band , improving the sensitivity by a factor of 2 with respect to paper i. the logn ",
    "logs relationship of the hard sample confirmed the previous findings obtained from the 120 ksec exposure ( paper i ) .",
    "the average slope turns out to be @xmath171 , which is flatter with respect to the quasi ",
    "euclidean slope found by asca at the bright end ( @xmath120 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , adopting a fit with double power law in the whole flux range , we find indication for flattening down to @xmath172 below @xmath173 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .    after the inclusion of the asca sources at the bright end , the total contribution to the resolved hard x  ray background down to our flux limit of @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 now amounts to @xmath174 erg @xmath3 s@xmath2 deg@xmath10 .",
    "this result is robust to variations of the average spectral slope in the hard sample , which can be as low as @xmath175 for the faintest sources .",
    "the value for the unresolved x ",
    "ray background ranges from @xmath176 to @xmath177 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 , so a fraction between 60% and 90% of the hard xrb has now been resolved .",
    "we confirm our previous finding on the average spectrum of the sources of the total sample , which can be well approximated with a power law with index @xmath101 .",
    "we also find a progressive hardening of the sources at lower fluxes , both for the soft and the hard samples .",
    "in particular , we divided the hard sample into three subsamples : bright ( @xmath114 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ) , faint ( @xmath178 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ) and very faint ( @xmath116 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the average power law is @xmath118 for the bright subsample , @xmath12 for the faint subsample , @xmath119 for the very faint subsample .",
    "the progressive hardening at faint fluxes is probably due to a stronger intrinsic absorption .    in the soft band",
    "the counts show a slope of @xmath179 ( 1 sigma error ) , clearly flatter than the slope at the bright end measured by rosat .",
    "a double power law fit indicates a progressive flattening at the faint end , with a best fit with @xmath180 for fluxes below @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 . the soft x ",
    "ray background in the energy range 12 kev is now resolved at the level of 8196 % depending on the assumed value for the unresolved soft xrb .",
    "the soft and the hard logn ",
    "logs must ultimately approach each other .",
    "in fact , in the unified agn explanation of the xrb we should , with increasing sensitivity , see the same objects in both bands .",
    "however , if the remaining hard population is constituted by sources that are even more strongly absorbed , there will be a significant fraction of hard sources still undetected in the soft band also at @xmath181 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "following the model b in gilli , salvati & hasinger ( 2001 ) , we found that the soft and hard logn  logs predict the same source density at @xmath182 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "we have also used measured redshifts for 86 sources .",
    "the spectra will be presented in the catalog paper of the 1ms exposure ( giacconi et al , in preparation ) .",
    "we find that the hard sources with @xmath142 are typically found at @xmath131 , with intrinsic luminosities between @xmath155 and @xmath183 erg s@xmath2 in the soft band . between the objects producing the 210 kev x ",
    "ray background , the ones with @xmath184 ( producing between 2030% of the total xrb ) appear relatively nearby ( redshifts @xmath131 ) and are most easily identified with seyfert ii galaxies ( see also barger et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we note that a bias could be present against obscured agns , since our spectroscopically identified sample is not complete and obscured agns are expected to have on average fainter magnitudes than the unobscured ones .",
    "one of the important results of chandra is the detection of obscured qsos .",
    "a first clear example of hard ( i.e. likely obscured ) x  ray sources at high redshift with x  ray luminosities above @xmath185 erg s@xmath2 have been already found ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this source is extensively described in norman et al .",
    "when the optical identification program will be completed , it will be possible to test whether the population of aborbed agn is as large as assumed in the agn synthesis models of the xrb ( madau , ghisellini & fabian 1993 ; comastri et al . 1995 ; gilli et al .",
