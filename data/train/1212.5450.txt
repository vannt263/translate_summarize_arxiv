    "true long - range order is most desirable .",
    "but due to fluctuation effects only algebraic long - range order will exist in the lo phase @xcite , making it more difficult to observe the periodicity .",

    "[ fasediagram2 ] .",
    "therefore , it is not expected that taking into account a more complicated form for the gap will change the phase diagram qualitatively . moreover , our calculation is variational and thus gives a conservative estimate of the supersolid region of the phase diagram .    in this paper we presented results for a homogeneous system and",
    "we did not consider a confining trap . to take into account the trap for the atoms , a local - density approximation can be made .",

    "<S> subsequently , we calculate the atomic density modulation of the atoms in the lo phase and show that it is sufficiently large to be visible in experiment .    since the first realization of superfluidity in a two - component gas of fermionic atoms a large number of exciting experiments have been performed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with the use of a feshbach resonance the inter - particle interactions can be tuned and hereby the crossover between the bose - einstein condensation of molecules and cooper pairs was studied @xcite . by inducing spin flips in a fermi gas the number of particles in different spin states can be changed , opening up the possibility of studying the influence of a population imbalance on the phase transition to a superfluid state . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility has indeed been materialized in a two - component gas of @xmath0li atoms and the phase diagram turns out to be governed by a tricritical point below which the gas phase separates into a superfluid and normal region @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the exotic states of matter that may also be realized in a system of ultracold fermi atoms is a superfluid where the cooper pairs have a nonzero center - of - mass momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the first to propose this possibility in the context of superfluid films in a magnetic field were fulde and ferrel ( ff ) @xcite and independently larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> signatures of these so called fflo phases have been seen in an atomic gas in one spatial dimension @xcite , but a decisive experiment that observes the fflo correlations has not been carried out yet . in three spatial dimensions a phase with nonzero momentum cooper pairs is predicted to be present in the population imbalanced fermi gas with weak interactions @xcite . however , the transition temperatures in a weakly interacting fermi gas are very low and are expected to be out of reach with present cooling techniques .     </S>",
    "<S> phase diagram for the unitary mixture of @xmath0li and @xmath1k atoms ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> each full line denotes a continuous phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the grey rectangle on the horizontal axis sets the scale for panel ( b ) , where along the line of phase transitions to an inhomogeneous superfluid the wavevector @xmath3 associated with the periodicity is shown . </S>",
    "<S> also shown are the fermi wavevectors of the @xmath4li(@xmath5 ) and @xmath6k(@xmath7 ) atoms and their difference , all at @xmath8 and @xmath9 . ]    in the three - dimensional strongly interacting mixture of @xmath0li and @xmath1k atoms a lifshitz instability towards a phase with nonzero momentum cooper pairs is present at an attainable temperature @xcite , but the precise form of this superfluid phase has not yet been determined . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that at temperatures below the lifshitz point the fermi gas will form the exotic lo phase , which shares the properties of both a solid and a superfluid and is therefore a special kind of supersolid . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very exciting prospect , because even though this new kind of superfluid was first proposed by larkin and ovchinnikov already in 1964 @xcite , it has never been observed in a three - dimensional fluid . in the @xmath0li-@xmath1k mixture important steps </S>",
    "<S> have already been made experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the feshbach resonances of the mixture were known for some time @xcite , and now also expansion under the influence of strong interactions from an optical dipole trap has been realized @xcite , a large atom number dual - species magneto - optical trap was built @xcite , and the repulsive polaron has been studied in this mixture @xcite . at present , therefore , an ultra - cold @xmath0li-@xmath1k mixture at unitarity is to the best of our knowledge one of the most promising systems available in the laboratory to observe such a three - dimensional supersolid in a locally homogeneous trapping geometry and study its properties in detail with the accuracy of atomic physics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there recently have been proposals to observe ff and lo states in the presence of optical lattices @xcite and to observe ff states in cold atom systems with spin - orbit coupling @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the lo state is also expected to be present in a number of other condensed - matter systems , such as in superfluid @xmath2he in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite , neutron stars @xcite and heavy - fermion systems @xcite . in the context of colorsuperconductivity a large body of theoretical </S>",
    "<S> work has been concerned with different inhomogeneous phases @xcite , all considering weak coupling and using ginzburg - landau expansions of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> although continuous ( second - order ) instabilities can be determined exactly using this expansion , the downfall is that ruling out discontinuous ( first - order ) transitions is impossible and one is moreover forced to remain close to the normal - superfluid transition .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we calculate for different superfluid phases where time - reversal or translational symmetry is broken the full thermodynamic potential within mean - field theory , with which both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions can be described . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in contrast to previous work , it enables us to describe transitions within the superfluid phase . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> we complete the phase diagram of the mixture of @xmath0li-@xmath1k atoms for a majority of @xmath1k atoms , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fasediagram](a ) , and especially what the structure of the inhomogeneous superfluid is . for a majority of @xmath0li atoms </S>",
    "<S> it was shown already that a tricritical point is present , below which a discontinuous phase transition towards a homogeneous superfluid , and thus phase separation , occurs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find for small negative polarizations @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the density of @xmath0li(@xmath1k ) atoms , a continuous transition from the normal state ( n ) to a homogeneous superfluid ( hsf ) , up to the lifshitz point ( lp ) . for larger majorities of @xmath1k atoms </S>",
    "<S> there is a continuous phase transition to an inhomogeneous superfluid phase where translational symmetry is broken in one spatial direction ( lo ) and from the point lp on the continuous transition is to a phase where translational symmetry is broken in three directions ( lo@xmath2 ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fasediagram](a ) the temperature @xmath12 is scaled by the critical temperature @xmath13 at @xmath14 and the polarization @xmath15 is scaled by the critical polarization @xmath16 at @xmath8 , because interaction effects in first instance only shift the location of the lifshitz point @xcite , as we explain below .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we first explain how we calculate , within a mean - field approximation , the full thermodynamic potential for different inhomogeneous superfluid phases and how we obtain the phase diagram in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fasediagram](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sectie expansion ] we describe the ginzburg - landau expansion of the different free energies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that from comparing the expansion coefficients it can be directly seen which inhomogeneous superfluid phase is the most favorable . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we discuss the possibility of having a linear position of the lo and the lo@xmath2 phases and show that this does not occur . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ section green s function ] we explain how we calculate the transition line between the lo and lo@xmath2 inhomogeneous phases in a direct manner . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ section densities ] , we determine the densities for the two atomic species in the lo phase at the conditions of the cross in fig . [ fasediagram](a ) , which are now position dependent with a modulation that can be as big as 10@xmath17 over one period . </S>",
    "<S> this is therefore a convenient signature for the lo phase in experiment , but also other proposals to observe this exotic state of matter have been made @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the phase diagram for the @xmath4li-@xmath6k mixture within a mean - field approximation , which does not include all important physical effects such as , for instance , the screening of the interaction by particle - hole fluctuations . it is known that in the strongly interacting limit these effects play an important role and mean - field theory does not give good quantitative results . </S>",
    "<S> however , the phase diagram for the unitary fermi mixture with population imbalance predicted by mean - field theory was reproduced qualitatively by renormalization - group calculations that do incorporate fluctuation and interaction effects @xcite and , more importantly , that are in agreement with the phase diagram mapped out experimentally @xcite . from this it can be concluded that for these purposes the mean - field calculation already contains the relevant physics , even at unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> the lifshitz point found in the @xmath4li-@xmath6k mixture using mean - field theory remains present when adding screening and selfenergy effects and its position only changes quantitatively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative succes of mean - field theory is , physically , due to the fact that even at unitarity the atomic selfenergies are well approximated by a momentum and frequency independent constant . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamic instabilities are determined by mean - field - like correlation functions with strongly renormalized constants that lead to quantitative shifts only in the transition lines . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , mean - field theory is even at unitarity a good first approximation to explore the superfluid phases that can occur in the @xmath4li-@xmath6k mixture and map out the phase diagram , which is the main aim of this paper . </S>"
