    "a gel is a soft poroelastic material which consists of a solid network and a colloidal solvent .",

    "the solvent can permeate through the solid network and the permeation can be controlled by external forces . both by weight and volume , gels are mostly liquid in composition and thus exhibit densities similar to liquids .",
    "however , they have the structural coherence of a solid and can be deformed . a gel network can be composed of a wide variety of materials , including particles , polymers and proteins , which then gives different types gels such hydrogels , organogels and xerogels ( cf .",
    "gels have some fascinating properties , in particular , they display thixotropy which means that they become fluid when agitated , but resolidify when resting . in general , gels are apparently solid , jelly - like materials , they exhibit an important state of matter found in a wide variety of biomedical and chemical systems ( cf .",

    "this paper develops and analyzes some fully discrete finite element methods for a displacement - pressure model for polymer gels .",
    "the model , which was proposed by m. doi _ et al _ in @xcite , describes swelling dynamics of polymer gels ( under mechanical constraints ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded domain and denote the initial region occupied by the gel .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the displacement of the gel at the point @xmath2 in the space and at the time @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the velocity and the pressure of the solvent at @xmath6 .",
    "following @xcite , the governing equation for the swelling dynamics of polymer gels are given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the friction constant associated with the motion of the polymer relative to the solvent , @xmath9 is the volume fraction of the polymer , @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11 identity matrix , and @xmath12 stands for the stress tensor of the gel network , which is given by a constitutive equation . in this paper",
    ", we use the following linearized form of the stress tensor : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the bulk and shear modulus of the gel ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . we remark that stands for the force balance , states darcy s law for the permeation of solvent through the gel network , and describes the incompressibility condition .",
    "in addition , if we introduce the total stress @xmath16 , then equation becomes @xmath17 .",
    "substituting into and into yield the following basic equations for swelling dynamics of polymer gels ( see @xcite ) @xmath18 which hold in the space - time domain @xmath19 for some given @xmath20 .    to close the above system",
    ", we need to prescribe boundary and initial conditions .",
    "only one initial condition is required for the system , which is @xmath21 various sets of boundary conditions are possible and each of them describes a certain type mechanical condition and solvent permeation condition ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the following set of boundary conditions @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the outward normal to @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 means that the mechanical force @xmath26 is applied on the boundary of the gel . since @xmath27 ,",
    "hence , @xmath28 implies that the solvent can not permeate through the gel boundary .",
    "we also remark that the force function @xmath26 must satisfy the compatibility condition @xmath29    problem  is interesting and difficult due to its multiphysical nature which describes the complicate fluid and solid interaction inside the gel network .",
    "it is numerically tricky to solve because it is difficult to design a good and workable time - stepping scheme .",
    "for example , one natural attempt would be at each time step first to solve a poisson problem for @xmath30 and then to solve a linear elasticity problem for @xmath31 . however , this strategy is difficult to realize because there is no good way to compute the source term @xmath32 for the poisson equation .",
    "in fact , the strategy even has a difficulty to start due to the fact that no initial condition is provided for the pressure @xmath30 .    to overcome the difficulty , in this paper we shall use a reformulation of system  , which is now introduced .",
    "define @xmath33 physically , @xmath34 measures the volume change of the solid network of the gel , and often called  elastic pressure \" or  volume change function \" .",
    "taking divergence on yields @xmath35 which and imply that @xmath34 satisfies the following diffusion equation @xmath36 however , the usefulness of the above diffusion equation is hampered by the lack of boundary condition for @xmath34 .",
    "we like to note that the above diffusion equation for @xmath34 was first noticed by m. doi @xcite , but it was not utilized before exactly because of the lack of boundary condition for @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , using the new variable @xmath34 we can rewrite  as @xmath37 an immediate consequence of the above reformulation is that - implies @xmath38 satisfies the generalized stokes equations with @xmath34 being the source term at each time @xmath3 , and @xmath34 satisfies a diffusion equation and it interacts with @xmath38 only at the boundary @xmath24 .",
    "this is a key observation because it not only reveals the underlying physical process of swelling dynamics of the gel , but also gives the  right \" hint on how the problem should be solved numerically .",
    "this indeed motivates the main idea of this paper , that is , _ at each time step , we first solve the generalized stokes problem for @xmath39 , which in turn provides ( implicitly ) an updated boundary condition for @xmath34 , we then use this new boundary condition to solve the diffusion equation for @xmath34 .",
    "the process is repeated iteratively until the final time step is reached_. however , in order to make this idea work , there is one crucial issue needs to be addressed .",
    "that is , for a given @xmath34 the generalized stokes problem for @xmath39 is only unique up to additive constants .",
    "clearly , how to correctly enforce the uniqueness of the generalized stokes problem is the bottleneck of this approach .",
    "it is easy to understand that one can not use arbitrary constraints to fix @xmath39 because this will lead to bad or even divergent numerical schemes if the exact pde solution does not satisfy the constraints . instead",
    ", the constraints which can be used to fix @xmath39 should be those satisfied by the exact solution of the pde system .",
    "to the end , we need to discover some invariant ( or conserved ) quantities for the exact pde solution .",
    "it turns out that the situation is precisely what we anticipated and wanted .",
    "we are able to show that the exact pde solution @xmath40 satisfies the following identities ( see section [ sec-2 ] below for a proof ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denote the dimension of @xmath43 and @xmath44 obviously , the right - hand sides of and are constants .",

    "it follows from and that @xmath45 it is clear now that and provide two natural conditions which can be used to uniquely determine the solution @xmath38 to the generalized stokes problem  for a given source term @xmath34 .",

    "we note that is the implicit euler scheme , which is chosen just for the ease of presentation , it can be replaced by other time - stepping schemes .",
    "provides a neumann boundary condition for @xmath51 .",
    "another subtle issue is the role which the initial value @xmath54 plays in the algorithm .",
    "seems @xmath54 is only needed to produce @xmath55 and there is no need to have @xmath56 in order to execute the algorithm .",
    "however , to ensure the stability and convergence of the algorithm , it turns out that @xmath56 not only needs to be provided but also must be carefully constructed when the algorithm is discretized ( see sections [ sec-3 ] and [ sec-4 ] ) .",
    "the above algorithm has a couple attractive features .",
    "first , it is easy to use .",
    "second , it allows one to make use of any available numerical methods ( finite element , finite difference , finite volume , spectral and discontinuous galerkin ) and computer codes for the stokes problem and the poisson problem to solve the gel swelling dynamics model . we remark that an almost same model as  also arise from different applications in poroelasticity and soil mechanics and are known as boit s consolidation model ( cf .",

    "<S> the primary goal of this paper is to develop and analyze some fully discrete finite element methods for a displacement - pressure model modeling swelling dynamics of polymer gels under mechanical constraints . in the model , the swelling dynamics </S>",
    "<S> is governed by the solvent permeation and the elastic interaction ; the permeation is described by a pressure equation for the solvent , and the elastic interaction is described by displacement equations for the solid network of the gel . </S>",
    "<S> the elasticity is of long range nature and gives effects for the solvent diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> it is the fluid - solid interaction in the gel network drives the system and makes the problem interesting and difficult . </S>",
    "<S> by introducing an  elastic pressure \" ( or  volume change function \" ) we first present a reformulation of the original model , we then propose a time - stepping scheme which decouples the pde system at each time step into two sub - problems , one of which is a generalized stokes problem for the displacement vector field ( of the solid network of the gel ) and another is a diffusion problem for a </S>",

    "<S> the key to the first difficulty is to discover certain conservation laws ( or conserved quantities ) for the pde solution of the original model , and the solution to the second difficulty is to use the generalized stokes problem to generate a boundary condition for the diffusion problem . </S>",
    "<S> this then lays down the theoretical foundation for one to utilize any convergent stokes solver ( and its code ) together with any convergent diffusion equation solver ( and its code ) to solve the polymer gel model . in the paper , </S>",
    "<S> the taylor - hood mixed finite element method combined with the continuous linear finite element method are chosen as an example to present the ideas and to demonstrate the viability of the proposed multiphysical approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that , under a mesh constraint , both the proposed semi - discrete ( in space ) and fully discrete methods enjoy some discrete energy laws which mimic the differential energy law satisfied by the pde solution . </S>",
    "<S> optimal order error estimates in various norms are established for the numerical solutions of both the semi - discrete and fully discrete methods . </S>",
