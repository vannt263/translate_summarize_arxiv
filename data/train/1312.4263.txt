    "nonlinear partial differential equations , particularly those exhibiting solitary - wave solutions , have been of great interest for many decades .",
    "their applications range from classical and quantum field theories to condensed - matter problems  @xcite .",
    "typical examples are the equations of motion for a single scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "tremendous efforts have been made to find solitary - wave solutions in these systems .",
    "for completely integrable systems , like the sine - gordon model , one can apply a variety of sophisticated techniques such as the bcklund transformation  @xcite .",
    "a more down - to - earth approach , called the bogomolnyi method  @xcite , can be applied to even non - integrable models .",
    "this method reduces the original second - order differential equation to a first - order one , solutions of which are known as kinks ( or domain walls )  @xcite .",
    "kinks are perhaps the simplest kinds of topological solitons  @xcite .",
    "they behave as particle - like objects , with finite mass and a smooth structure . at the next level of complexity , one can consider systems of two coupled scalar fields in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it is also natural to ask whether topological solitons are special solutions of the equations of motion in such cases .",
    "rajaraman proposed a method for finding exact solutions of the problems  @xcite .",
    "his procedure is model - independent and can be , in principle , used for any model . in practice , however , the application of his method is limited since there is a need to choose  trial orbits \" on which the two fields satisfy some constraint .",
    "proposed another general method for constructing models exhibiting soliton solutions  @xcite .",
    "their approach is based on the idea of the bogomolnyi method .",
    "they also provided specific examples including coupled @xmath0 models . in this paper , we present a new class of systems with exact kink solutions that do not belong to the class of models in refs . @xcite .",
    "our approach is a hybrid of rajaraman s and bogomolnyi s methods .",
    "namely , the constraint on the two fields is embedded in a potential term , which does not alter the bogomolnyi bound .",
    "the simplest example presented in the next section can be thought of as an effective field theory describing the coupling of magnetic and ferroelectric domain walls in multiferroic gdfeo@xmath1  @xcite , where the composite of these domain walls has been observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "we show that when the parameter of the model is fine - tuned to a particular value , the composite of kinks in the individual scalar field theories , which we call the composite kink , is an exact solution of the equations of motion .",
    "we then generalize the idea of bazeia _ et al .",
    "_ , and show that the mass of the composite kink saturates a bogomolnyi - type bound . at the end of the paper , we provide a general recipe for constructing models in which the composite kinks are exact solutions of the equations of motion .",
