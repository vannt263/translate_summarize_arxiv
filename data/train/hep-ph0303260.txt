    "@xcite has several purposes .",
    "the intermediate goal is to summarize and consolidate the effort of the last three decades in calculating standard model radiative corrections for lep , in a well organized calculational environment , for future reference .",
    "however , it is aimed not only at training young researchers and students , but at some remaining calculational projects for lep as well .",
    "recently it was used for that purpose in  @xcite .    an important lesson from the lep experiments",
    "@xcite is that the desirable way of providing theoretical predictions is in the form of monte carlo event generators .",
    "this aspect has been taken into account in the development of from an early stage of its development .",
    "the currently available version can construct one - loop spin amplitudes for the decays of the gauge bosons @xmath2 and @xmath6 and of the higgs boson @xmath7 . for the moment ,",
    "features single real - photon emission , in the calculations of the total rate and decay spectra of the @xmath8 process . the complete spin polarization density matrix of the decaying boson is taken into account as well .",
    "the integration , with the monte carlo method , over the three- ( two)-body final state is done without any approximation ( in particular , the small - mass approximation is not used ) .",
    "the program provides mc events with constant weight ( unweighted events ) .",
    "the whole system is , therefore , fairly self - contained and complete .",
    "it is of the utmost importance for such a system to reproduce known results precisely ; this step of its development was completed in ref .",
    "let us turn now to its application : first find an approximation of the relatively large terms missing in photos @xcite for generation of bremsstrahlung in @xmath2 decay , later install them into this program , and finally verify , again with , that the photos algorithm for the generation of bremmstrahlung in decays , after modifications , works indeed better .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we recall , from @xcite , the set of observables chosen for tests and we explain the input parameters used in  and photos .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the  matrix elements for qed bremsstrahlung .",
    "the gauge - invariant part of this matrix element , which is expected to be responsible for the photos discrepancies with exact matrix element , is removed from first .",
    "these terms are approximated by simple formula and installed to a photos .",
    "section 4 describes comparisons of full with photos with the new correcting weight introduced .",
    "a summary , section 5 , closes the paper .",
    "in the following sections we compare predictions from the programs and photos . it is essential that the initialization be identical in all cases and close to the physical reality ; in particular the following options are set in the two programs :    * in  we switch off the ew part of the radiative corrections .",
    "the soft / hard photon limit is kept at 0.005 of the decaying particle mass . * in photos we switch off the double bremsstrahlung corrections .",
    "the soft / hard photon limit is kept at 0.005 of the decaying particle mass . for the generation of the born - level two - body",
    "decays , we use the monte carlo generation from .    to visualize the differences ( or the agreement ) between the calculations , we choose a certain class of ( pseudo-)observables , more precisely the one - dimensional distributions , which are quite similar to the ones used in the first tests of photos reported in @xcite . to visualize the usually small differences , we plot ratios of the predictions from the two programs rather than the distributions themselves",

    "we have indeed found that analysing the difference between the complete and truncated matrix elements of sanc such a correction weight @xmath28 can be found .",

    "the agreement is now also at the 10% level in the phase - space regions where only non - leading corrections contribute to the matrix elements .",
