    "in the standard framework of gravitational instability theory present day structures must have been formed through the growth of small inhomogeneities from an initial random gaussian density field present at very early epochs , with a scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "clustering analysis of the large scale structure in the universe has been improved in recent years by observations of the spatial distribution of galaxies and cluster of galaxies , as well as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "thus any theory that wants to fit the observed large scale clustering must be consistent with a set of constraints over more than three decades in length : from galaxy correlation ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) up to the quadrupole cmb anisotropies detected by cobe ( @xmath15 , @xcite ) .    in the standard frw metric the fundamental background cosmological parameters are related by a mutual relation .",
    "it is also understood that for these parameters ( the present matter density @xmath7 , the value of the hubble constant @xmath16 and the age of the universe @xmath17 ) the range of values allowed by observations must be consistent with their frw relation . if we adopt the standard inflation theory we shall assume that the total energy density in the universe is equal to the critical density ( @xmath18 ) . on the other hand , observations and theoretical predictions suggest that the amount of baryon density must be small ( @xmath19 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a much larger contribution to the matter density must be of non - baryonic nature .",
    "this is so - called dark matter ( dm ) problem and it has observational support from dynamical estimates ( @xmath20 , @xcite and references cited therein ) . it must be stressed that there is not yet a firm evidence for @xmath21 , this value for @xmath7 being required by the inflationary paradigm .",
    "the simplest possible model of dm is the one in which the universe is dynamically dominated by a single massive collisionless particle .",
    "the most popular dm candidates are collisionless massive particles , which decoupled from cosmological plasma either when being relativistic ( dm particles like massive neutrinos  hot dm ) or non - relativistic ( hypothetical massive particles  cold dm ) .",
    "the simplest model is cdm , where the power spectrum of the perturbations depends on a single parameter , the present cold density @xmath22 .",
    "historically the first model to be considered was a neutrino with a non - zero rest mass hdm ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the hdm model was soon rejected because numerical simulations ( @xcite ) produced nonlinear structures too late to be in agreement with qso existence . the standard cdm model ( scdm )",
    "has been analysed in considerable details ( @xcite ; @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "it can match galaxy clustering ( @xmath23 ) with a bias parameter @xmath24 , although it lacks of sufficient power on large scales .",
    "the scdm model however became seriously inconsistent with clustering data after the cobe detection of a quadrupole anisotropy in the cmb ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the power spectrum of the model is normalized to the cobe data scdm models have unavoidable difficulties ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; jing & valdarnini 1993 ; dalton et al . 1991 ; baugh & efstathiou 1994 ) .",
    "the mixed dark matter models ( mdm ) was at first proposed  and  discussed  in a few papers ( fang , xiang & li 1984 ; shafi & stecker 1984 ; achilli , occhionero & scaramella 1985 ; valdarnini & bonometto 1985 ) as an example to overcome the standard hot dark matter ( shdm ) .",
    "later , smdm models were readressed again ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it was proposed that a certain mixture proportion of about @xmath25 for the hot / cold dm ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; klypin et al .",
    "1993 ; pogosyan & starobinsky 1993 ) as a dm model satisfying a wide body of observational data for clustering ( distributions of galaxies , galaxy clusters , quasars , ly-@xmath26 systems , etc . ) on typical scales @xmath27 and with an harrison - zeldovich spectrum of the primordial cosmological perturbations on scales @xmath28 .",
    "because of the changes introduced into the power spectrum by neutrino clustering , for smdm models it was shown the possibility to reconcile the evidence of high coherent velocity flows on large scales ( @xmath29 ) with the moderate galactic pair velocities on megaparsec scales ( @xcite ) . for the cluster correlation function ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) the two - point function for smdm models appears to be consistent with data for @xmath30 ( on the contrary to what found for cdm ) .",
    "analytical approximations for the present epoch transfer functions are given by holtzmann ( 1989 ) ; pogosyan & starobinsky ( 1995 ) ; ma ( 1996 ) ; eisenstein & hu ( 1997 ) .",
    "early numerical simulations have considered @xmath31 , we will use the notation @xmath32 for massive neutrinos , but this model does not produce ly-@xmath26 systems as much as observed ( @xcite ) . for this reason a value of @xmath33 results in a better fit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in comparison with scdm or shdm ,",
    "mdm models are more complicated , we have the choice of two independent parameters : the ratio @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( if one allows for more than one species of massive neutrinos ) . the spectral index @xmath36 of the post - inflationary spectrum is taken @xmath37 .",
    "it is possible to consider also the role of gravitational waves , which can change significally the normalization of the spectrum and the formation of structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it must be stressed that smdm models are in difficulty with the present upper limits on the age of the universe : if we assume @xmath9 and the age of globular clusters greater than @xmath38 , in the case of a flat frw model the needed value of @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",
    "the other difficulties are connected with later galaxy and quasar formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another difficulty for smdm models is that when the power spectra are normalized to the cobe 4-yr data the linear theory overpredicits the observed cluster abundances .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in the normalization and linear calculations can hardly fit the cluster number density within present data error bars .",
    "the difficulty can be reduced if one removes the constraint of a scale invariant spectra and introduces a small tilt ( @xmath41 , @xcite ) .    in alternative to mdm models spatially flat low density models with a positive cosmological constant",
    "are considered to be a viable generalization of scdm after cobe .",
    "these models are termed @xmath1cdm and were considered even before the quadrupole detection ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are two main reason to consider @xmath1cdm models as an alternative to mdm : the present lower limit on the age of the universe and the baryon fraction in galaxy clusters .",
    "current uncertainties for the age of globular clusters give @xmath42 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if one takes a lower limits @xmath43 then in the @xmath21 case the maximum value for @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "this value is below the range allowed by recent hst measurement : @xmath46 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of a positive cosmological constant allows @xmath44 to be higher for a fixed age @xmath17 than in @xmath21 .",
    "the other reason to consider @xmath1cdm model is from x - ray observations of galaxy clusters .",
    "if clusters are a representative sample of the matter content in the universe , then their baryons / total matter ratio should not be different from what expected from standard nucleosynthesis ( @xcite ) . for @xmath47 this is achieved if @xmath48 .",
    "quite interestingly this range is close to that obtained from dynamical estimates .",
    "after cobe detection of the quadrupole anisotropy @xmath1cdm models have been further considered ( kofman , gnedin & bahcall 1993 ; klypin , primack & holtzman 1996 ; liddle et al .",
    "1996a ; liddle et al .",
    "they  can fit several constraints on large scales ( @xmath49 , @xcite ) , but small scales clustering it is excess ( @xcite ) by a factor @xmath50 when compared to estimates from galaxy catalogs , so this is a difficulty of the model which can be solved with the introduction of an antibias of small scales .",
    "a possibility which seems unplausible ( @xcite ) .",
    "these difficulties have suggested that consistency with present data can be achieved for standard dm models with the introduction of one extra parameter .",
    "possible variants are two species of massive neutrinos ( primack 1997 ) , or a tilt of the primordial spectrum ( cole et al",
    ". 1997 ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to consider an alternative possibility , that is mdm models with @xmath37 and a non - zero cosmological constant ( mlm ) .",
    "these models have in fact the following free parameters : @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the number of species of massive neutrinos .",
    "if one considers one species of massive neutrinos , then mlm are on the same foot of the previous alternatives , the main advantage being that they retain the inflation paradigm and a scale - invariant initial spectrum .    in order to study these models we have numerically integrated forward in time the linearized einstein - boltzmann equations for the evolution of the metric and density perturbations .",
    "the final power spectra have been normalized according to the four year cobe data ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have then used linear perturbation theory to find the parameters for which mlm models are consistent with a variety of current observational constraints on large scales ( power spectrum , cluster - cluster correlations , bulk velocities , cluster abundance ) .",
    "in order to make comparison with observations we will consider the following set of parameter space : @xmath53 ; @xmath54 ; number of massive and massless neutrinos @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( here @xmath57 is the sum of spin states ) . in some cases we considered a number of neutrinos species greater than three , this possibility being of no physical relevance , we ran these models for studying how different numbers of massive and massless particles would change the spectra evolution .",
    "our final analysis will be restricted to one massive neutrino .",
    "the fifth parameter is @xmath44 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we will present our model description and equations describing the linear perturbations in mlm models . in section 3",
    "we will study the power spectra dependence on model parameters using cobe 4-year data normalization . in section 4",
    "some linear tests are given for mlm models , including our results for the cluster mass and temperature function .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "we have studied the evolution of density perturbations in a flat friedmann cosmology . in our models",
    "the present total density in critical units is @xmath59 .",
    "the notation @xmath32 means massive neutrinos , @xmath60 cold dark matter and @xmath61 .    in our integrations",
    "we have followed numerically the time evolution of the linearized einstein - boltzmann equations for the metric and adiabatic density perturbations .",
    "we have considered scalar modes only and treated the perturbations for the following particle species : cold , massive and massless neutrinos ( @xmath62 ) , photons .",
    "we treat baryons and radiation as a single ideal fluid .",
    "we have assumed that all collisionless particles were decoupled from radiation before the beginning of our computation . in a collisionless medium",
    "the pressure anisotropy is different from zero and the equations for density contrast and velocity are not sufficient to describe the perturbations in @xmath32 and @xmath62 particles .",
    "collisionless components must be described by the boltzmann - vlasov equation .",
    "the density contrast , flux velocity and pressure anisotropy are given by the moments of the perturbed distribution functions .",
    "the set of equations for fluid and collisionless media , with the einstein equations for metric perturbations , describes the evolution of density perturbations in mlm models .",
    "the method of numerical solution of this system is described in valdarnini & bonometto ( 1985 ) , and we refer to this paper for more details .",
    "the generalization of the equations to include a non - zero cosmological constant is straightforward .",
    "our numerical calculation is done for the following range of perturbation masses : from @xmath63 down to @xmath64 .",
    "the integrations start at the initial redshift @xmath65 and stop at the final epoch @xmath66 .",
    "because of the large region of parameter space that we have spanned with our integrations , and the computational resources we had available , we have decided to stop the numerical integrations at a final epoch @xmath67 . as a compromise between computing budget and the accuracy needed to evaluate observational linear variables at the present epoch we chose @xmath68",
    "the initial conditions for our linear computations are given by the harrison - zeldovich ( @xmath37 ) spectrum of density fluctuations : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the comoving wavenumber of the perturbation and @xmath71 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the total matter density perturbation is then defined as : @xmath72    the transfer function @xmath73 can be defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the fourier mode @xmath74 to the one of minimal @xmath70 , which corresponds to the wavenumber of the maximal mass perturbation @xmath63 .",
    "the final linear transfer functions of our integrations have then been evaluated at @xmath75 using analytical formula .",
    "the approximation involved neglects the changes in the shape of the transfer functions that take place between @xmath76 and @xmath75 because of the decrease in the neutrino streaming .",
    "the error involved in the computation of the linear variables , with which we test the models against a set of data , is negligible in most of the considered cases and amounts to a few percent when @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    to describe the evolution of fluctuations between @xmath79 and @xmath75 we have applied the well known exact analytical solutions of einstein equations for a perturbed flat dust model with non - zero @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a non - zero cosmological constant changes the expansion rate so that the scale factor has the following expression @xmath80 and as a result the growth of perturbations relative to that of a critical density universe , after the moment of equality of the cosmological constant density to the matter one , it is suppressed .",
    "the suppression coefficients for density and velocity perturbations are the following : @xmath81 @xmath82 the total suppression at z=0 is well approximated by @xmath83^{-1},\\eqno(6)\\ ] ] for density perturbations ( @xcite ) and by @xmath84 for peculiar velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "we express the final matter power spectrum which gives rise to the observed large scale structure of the universe as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a normalization constant and @xmath87 is the total matter transfer function . in eq.(7 )",
    "@xmath88 is the density weighted power spectrum , i.e. @xmath89 ^ 2 $ ] .      in order to constrain a cosmological model",
    "one has to fix the normalization amplitude of the density fluctuation power spectrum at the present epoch .",
    "the most accurate method for normalizing @xmath88 is to make use of the cobe satellite data for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies ( @xcite ) .",
    "bunn & white ( 1997 ) have carried out a likelihood analysis of the 4-year cobe dmr sky maps and have obtained the best - fitting quadrupole , the value of which depends strongly on the initial index @xmath36 , @xmath7 and the space curvature .",
    "for example , for a sachs - wolfe @xmath37 spectrum @xmath90 , for @xmath91 @xmath92 ; in the case of flat cosmological models with non - zero @xmath1 and open models its value increases when @xmath7 decreases . for the normalization of the spectra in different cosmologies liddle & lyth ( 1993 ) have proposed instead of the quadrupole to use the amplitude of the density perturbation at horizon - crossing @xmath93 defined by @xmath94 which fixes the present - day normalization of spectra .",
    "a fit to the 4-year cobe data for flat models with the @xmath37 post - inflation spectrum analysed here has the following simple form ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath95    proceeding from the definitions of @xmath93 and the power spectrum , eq.(7 ) , the normalization constant is calculated as @xmath96",
    "the power spectra of eq.(7 ) , normalized to the cobe 4-year data , are depicted in figs . 1 - 3 for different models .",
    "fig . 1 shows how the number of species of massive neutrinos , when @xmath97 is kept fixed ( @xmath98 ) , modifies the amplitude of the spectra at @xmath99 . as we can see , increasing the number of species of massive neutrinos from 1 to 3 decreases the power at scale @xmath100 of about 1.6 times .",
    "increasing the number of species of massless neutrinos when the number of the massive ones is fixed also suppresses the power .",
    "both of these effects have a simply explanation .",
    "the dynamics of the perturbations in the hot components depends on two characteristic scales : one of them is the free - streaming scale , which is about the inverse of the hubble scale , when the particles first become non - relativistic . in our case @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the redshift at which the @xmath32-particles become non - relativistic , @xmath103 is in @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the hubble function .",
    "the second one is connected to the free - streaming scale , i.e. the minimal size @xmath106 of @xmath32-particle objects that can collapse at a given redshift @xmath107 .",
    "after the epoch @xmath108 the velocities of massive neutrinos are redshifted away adiabatically , then @xmath109 decreases . on large scales , @xmath110 ,",
    "gravitational instability develops in a standard way . for the growing mode of adiabatic perturbations @xmath111 . on the other hand the growth of density perturbations on smaller scales , @xmath112 ,",
    "is reduced from the moment when a perturbation of a given scale enters the horizon and up to the time when the free - streaming scale becomes smaller than the perturbation size .",
    "because of the free - streaming effects density perturbations are erased away in the part of @xmath113 , they still grow in the cold component in such a way that the total density growth , although less than in cdm , appears much larger than in hdm model .",
    "finally for @xmath114 the perturbations in both components develop similarly : the dynamical amplitude @xmath115 gradually approaches the other component @xmath116 .    thus decreasing the mass of massive neutrinos ( increasing their number of species when @xmath97 is fixed ) shifts to later epochs the time when they become non - relativistic and the collisionless damping becomes more effective in slowing down the growth of matter density perturbations",
    ".    increasing the number of species ( @xmath117 ) of massless neutrinos results in a longer duration of the radiation dominated era and in a smaller redshift @xmath118 of the matter - radiation equality .",
    "it is useful to define the comoving wavenumber @xmath70 with respect to the scale that crosses the horizon at the matter - radiation epoch , i.e. @xmath119.\\ ] ] because of the approximate scaling of the transfer function with the dimensionless parameter @xmath120 , an increase in @xmath117 implies a reduced amplitude of the power spectrum at a given @xmath70 .",
    "so both of these effects , increasing the number of massive and massless neutrinos , increase the duration of the epoch when the growth of density perturbations is less effective .    the dependence of the spectra on @xmath97 , or on the neutrino rest mass , for one massive and two massless neutrino species is shown in fig .",
    "2 . increasing @xmath97 from 0.1 to 0.3 decreases the power at galaxy scales by a factor of about @xmath121 , at galaxy cluster scales by @xmath122 .",
    "the inverse behavior of these spectra near the maximum at @xmath123 is caused by the existence of three characteristic timescales for the hot component : the epoch when it becomes non - relativistic , the period of collisionless damping and when the energy density of massless neutrinos equals the massive one .",
    "the power spectra for different @xmath124 and fixed values for the parameters @xmath125 are shown in fig .",
    "the horizontal shift of the spectra is caused by the later epoch of equality of the energy densities for the @xmath62 and @xmath32 particles . in different @xmath1 models with fixed @xmath2",
    "the epoch of equality is different , in particular increasing the value of @xmath52 then @xmath22 decreases and @xmath126 decreases too .",
    "the vertical shift is caused by the coefficient @xmath127 in eq.(10 ) and the amplification of cmb anisotropies in non - zero @xmath1 models , which is included in the normalization parameter @xmath93 .",
    "the change of @xmath97 in non - zero @xmath52 models changes the spectra in a way similar to the @xmath128 case .",
    "the following property of spectra is suggested from our calculations : the models with the same component species ( @xmath129 ) but different @xmath7 and @xmath44 have the same form and localization of the maximum of @xmath88 when @xmath130 is constant .",
    "this is shown in fig . 4 for two values of @xmath130 : 0.176 and 0.275 .",
    "in order to test our models we compare the linearly evolved @xmath88 with the one obtained from clustering data .",
    "our power spectra @xmath88 have been computed for mlm models with a zero - baryonic content , in order to properly compare with data we then correct the shape of the transfer functions according to a baryonic fraction @xmath131 ( see sect.4.4 ) .",
    "we will make use of the dimensionless spectrum @xmath132 , calculated at @xmath75 , and compare it with the real space power spectrum of optical and iras galaxies obtained by peacock ( 1997 ) and peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) , taking into account redshift distortions and bias .",
    "because we have performed a linear calculation we restrict ourselves to comparing @xmath133 only in its linear part @xmath134 . for a linearly evolved spectrum the deviation from non - linearity because of",
    "gravitational clustering becomes significant at @xmath135 .    in figs .",
    "5 & 6 we show @xmath136 for a set of mlm models with different values of @xmath124 and @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "5 ) , @xmath137 ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "we assume one species of massive neutrinos .    for each case",
    "we show two subcases : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath10 we plot also the @xmath136 of the @xmath1cdm model with @xmath138 , normalized to an rms mass fluctuation @xmath139 ( see eq.(19 ) ) . for this model we will use the notation @xmath140 for @xmath136 .",
    "the observational data are shown as black circles and correspond to the real space apm power spectrum for galaxy data ( peacock 1997 ) .",
    "we make use of these data , rather than those of peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) , because of the improved treatment for clustering evolution performed in the former paper .    in order to constrain the parameter space for different models we have preferred not to do a @xmath141 analysis because of the correlation between different bins . also because of the statistical uncertainties we consider it more appropriate to make a qualitative comparison .",
    "we formally define a given model to be consistent with clustering data if the computed @xmath136 are within the @xmath142 errors for @xmath143 .    from fig .",
    "5a the model predictions for @xmath136 in the case of large values of @xmath124 ( @xmath144 ) are below the observational data in the linear @xmath70 region .",
    "this limit on @xmath124 can be reduced if one considers @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "5b ) . in this case",
    "the inconsistency in the linear regime is for @xmath124 @xmath145 .",
    "this shift in the spectrum follows from the dependencies discussed in the past section due to the increase in @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to note the drastic reduction of small - scale power in mlm models because of massive neutrinos . in the parameter space the closest model to @xmath1cdm , for the set of mlm models of fig .",
    "5b , is @xmath146 . at high wave - number",
    "the spectrum of this model is well below the @xmath140 of the @xmath1cdm .",
    "for ease of comparison the @xmath1cdm has been normalized to @xmath147 , while the cobe normalization yields @xmath148 . on the other hand",
    ", for the mlm models considered , we always found @xmath149 ( see sect.4.5 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that mlm models have the property of removing the unpleasant feature of galaxy anti - biasing , invoked for @xmath1cdm ( @xcite ) in order to fit clustering data .    as we can see from fig .",
    "5 the spectra of mlm models with @xmath150 do not contradict on linear scales the spectrum reconstructed from observations for @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",

    "this range of limits can be further constrained if one considers that non - linearity effects due to gravitational clustering will enhance @xmath136 well above our linear @xmath136 , for @xmath155 ( peacock 1997 ) .",
    "we then require that our linear spectra should be at least below the observed reconstructed spectrum in the high-@xmath70 region . furthermore",
    ", for @xmath10 , we already know that the @xmath1cdm over produces small - scale power , then the @xmath136 of our mlm models should not exceed the @xmath140 at high wave - numbers .",
    "the case @xmath9 does not give useful constraints , while for @xmath10 we obtain @xmath156 for @xmath157 ; @xmath158 for @xmath159 .",
    "the constraints that we obtain are for a constant linear bias , with @xmath160 .",
    "if the optical data are a biased tracer of the dark matter then these limits should be changed according to the value of @xmath161 .",
    "however no simple scaling is possible for the obtained constraints because the value of @xmath161 will change for any model according to the value of @xmath162 and @xmath163 . in sect.4.5",
    "we compare the constraints on @xmath39 that we obtain from cluster abundances with those given by clustering data , according to the value of @xmath164 .",
    "we do not attach a particular statistical significance to these lower limits on @xmath7 , nevertheless in some cases we found these limits to be consistent with the constraints on @xmath7 obtained independently from cluster abundances ( see sect.4.5 ) .",

    "when the power spectrum is known then the rms peculiar velocity of galaxies in a sphere of radius @xmath167 , corresponding to these data , can be calculated with the following expression @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the top - hat window function .",
    "the calculated predictions for the rms bulk motions for different mlm models with @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "7 . as we can see",
    ", decreasing @xmath7 effectively reduces the bulk motion and the explanation of the observed data in low @xmath7 models is problematic .",

    "the cluster - cluster correlation functions calculated for mlm spectra in the framework of gaussian random density fluctuation field explain the observed positive correlations at @xmath204 and are within the limits of the error bars for that observed at large distances when @xmath209 .    of the considered tests the most important turns out to be that based on cluster abundances , for which the present x - ray cluster temperature function can put strong limits on the initial spectrum amplitude , or conversely on @xmath164 . because of the strong dependence of @xmath357 on temperature , the conversion of x - ray temperatures into masses is critical . from the discussion of section 4.5",
    "this conversion can be obtained with a dispersion of less than 10 % .",
    "we have then used the press & schechter ( 1974 ) formalism to compute the cluster number density for different mlm models .",
    "consistency with present data can be achieved for cobe normalized models only for the following range of values ( at @xmath12 level ) : @xmath358 , @xmath359 and @xmath360 . in correspondence with these limits , the allowed values of @xmath164",
    "are : @xmath307 ( @xmath9 ) or @xmath308 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these limits suggest that mlm models require a moderate amount of bias to be consistent with clustering data . for these range of values consistency with clustering data yields @xmath361 for @xmath359 and @xmath362 .",
    "models with @xmath363 are almost inconsistent .",
    "one can also compare these constraints with those given by considering cluster evolution .",
    "the evolution of galaxy clusters has recently been used also for determining the cosmological parameters @xmath164 and @xmath7 .",
    "fan , bahcall & cen ( 1997 ) found @xmath364 .",
    "this range of values is consistent with the @xmath164 required for mlm with @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "15 ) , and marginally consistent if @xmath9 . at the @xmath300 level none of the mlm models considered here",
    "is ruled out .",
    "finally henry ( 1997 ) has used recent data for the evolution of the cluster x - ray temperature function to determine @xmath7 and @xmath164 . for a flat cosmology he obtains @xmath365 and @xmath366 , in close agreement with our findings for mlm models .",
    "the observed abundance of damped lyman-@xmath26 systems has been used to obtain lower limits on the rms mass fluctuation @xmath367 at @xmath320 using press - schechter theory .",
    "these limits yield the following constraints on @xmath7 for mlm models with @xmath358 : @xmath368 for @xmath9 ( @xmath369 .",
    "these values have been obtained assuming the fraction of neutral hydrogen to be unity .",
    "if this fraction is close to @xmath370 , as suggested by numerical hydro simulations , then the constraints for mlm models become much more severe . in this case consistency with both",
    "damped lyman-@xmath26 and cluster abundances can be achieved only for @xmath10 , @xmath371 and @xmath372 .    in order to further restrict our models",
    "we can also consider present observational constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the cosmological constant is constrained to be @xmath373 at the 95 % confidence limit by qso lensing ( kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "a tighter restriction comes from the recent work of perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on sn ia , who give @xmath374 still at 95 % c.l . .",
    "recent hipparcos data ( feast & catchpole 1997 , reid 1997 ) have brought down the cepheid scale distance , thus reducing the estimated globular cluster age to @xmath375 and @xmath44 to a mid term @xmath376 .",
    "these values still require a cosmological constant , but not as high as in @xmath1cdm models .",
    "a value of @xmath377 is needed to satisfy the new age constraint .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath7 can be obtained from the estimated baryonic content of galaxy clusters .",
    "if clusters are massive enough to represent a fair sample of the total matter content in the universe , as numerical simulations confirm ( @xcite ) , then the baryon fraction @xmath378 ( evrard 1997 ) should be close to its universal value .",
    "thus the standard big bang nucleosynthesis value @xmath379 ( @xcite ) can be used to infer @xmath380 . for @xmath317",
    "one obtains @xmath381 . for a flat model this limit already overlaps the lower limit from sn ia",
    "this is the main argument for a cosmological constant , possible counter arguments like a magnetic field pressure or density inhomogeneities , which can lead to underestimate the total cluster mass , are unlikely to push the limit up to @xmath21 ( evrard 1997 and references cited therein ) .",
    "the region of parameter space which is allowed by these observational constraints for a flat model is then : @xmath382 , @xmath383 .",
    "these are also the limits that for mlm models the cosmological parameters must independently satisfy in order to achieve consistency with the set of linear clustering data previously analysed .",
    "we think that this is a notable feature of mlm models and one of the most important results of this paper .",
    "we then summarize our conclusions by saying that mlm models appear to be a promising class of cosmological dark matter models .",
    "our linear analysis shows that consistency for the cosmological parameters is achieved over a wide range of observational data .",
