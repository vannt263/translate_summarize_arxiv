    ", @xcite showed that the widths of resonant levels of a 1d island embedded in an interacting 1d wire decrease as a power law over a range of temperatures , in a quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction by @xcite . in an swnt experiment ,",
    "on the other hand , @xcite studied a quantum dot ( qd ) , formed by adjacent defects in a long metallic swnt , in a set geometry .",
    "the conductance as a function of temperature was seen to deviate from the conventional predictions @xcite . to explain the unpredicted temperature dependence of the conductance at low temperatures , @xcite , followed by @xcite , proposed a new transport mechanism , correlated sequential tunneling ( cst ) , in which additional quantum correlations due to coulomb interactions across the barriers were considered beyond the conventional ( uncorrelated ) sequential tunneling ( ust ) approach .",
    "the power - law exponent of the temperature dependence of conductance in the ust and cst approaches in the strong interaction regime has been studied by several groups .",
    "while the numerical approach using a dynamical quantum monte carlo method supports cst approach @xcite , the `` leading - log '' methods followed by the functional renormalization group approaches does not support the cst mechanism @xcite .    since the pioneering works by @xcite , many properties of the double barrier ( db ) structure with the luttinger liquid leads have been investigated for quantum dots with single resonant level @xcite and with many resonant levels @xcite .",
    "later , even the quantum dot was descried using the luttinger model . in this regime ,",
    "new phenomena arise due to the interplay between interactions within the 1d wire and the coulomb blockade induced by the confinement of electrons in a small region . since the elementary excitations in the system are plasmons ( charge density waves ) , the excitation spectrum of the qd is bosonic .",

    "this is the case when the plasmon excitations in the quantum dot redistribute only via the single - electron tunneling events through tunnel barriers .",
    "we found that while the steady - state plasmon distribution in the qd is highly non - equilibrium , the average electric current is only weakly affected by the non - equilibrium properties of plasmons @xcite . on the other hand , the non - equilibrium plasmons _",

    "both of these characteristics show non - poissonian behavior even at low bias voltages : the shot noise is greatly enhanced above the poissonian limit ( super - poissonian ) and the enhancement is more severe in the strong interaction limit @xcite .    as an extension of our previous work @xcite , we investigate the consequence of the non - equilibrium plasmons on average current , shot noise , and full counting statistics of a 1d - set that consists of three luttinger liquid segments , based on a master equation approach in the conventional sequential tunneling regime ( st ) . in sec .",
