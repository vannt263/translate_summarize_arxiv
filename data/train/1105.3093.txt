    "the main characters in this paper are tilings of a rectangle by finitely many rectangles .",
    "a _ cross _ in such a tiling is a point which is a corner of four distinct tiles . fixing a rectangle @xmath0 and considering the space of all tilings of @xmath0 by @xmath1 rectangles , with a uniform probability measure",
    ", the set of tilings having one or more crosses has measure zero .",
    "thus we call a tiling _ generic _ if it has no crosses .",
    "we consider generic tilings up to the natural combinatorial equivalence relation which we now describe .",
    "we orient @xmath0 so that its edges are vertical and horizontal .",
    "a rectangle @xmath2 in a tiling @xmath3 is _ below _ a rectangle @xmath4 if the top edge of @xmath2 intersects the bottom edge of @xmath4 ( necessarily in a line segment rather than in a point ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath2 is _ left of _",
    "@xmath4 if the right edge of @xmath2 intersects the left edge of @xmath4 . a tiling @xmath3 of a rectangle @xmath0 is combinatorially equivalent to a tiling @xmath5 of a rectangle @xmath6 if there is a bijection from the rectangles of @xmath3 to the rectangles of @xmath5 that exactly preserves the relations `` below '' and `` left of . ''",
    "a _ generic rectangulation _ is the equivalence class of a generic tiling .",
    "we will often blur the distinction between generic rectangulations ( i.e.  equivalence classes ) and equivalence class representatives , in particular specifying an equivalence class by describing a specific tiling .",
    "our main result is a bijection between generic rectangulations with @xmath1 rectangles and a class of permutations in @xmath7 that we call _ @xmath8-clumped permutations_. these are the permutations that avoid the patterns @xmath9-@xmath10-@xmath8-@xmath11 , @xmath9-@xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath8 , @xmath8-@xmath11-@xmath10-@xmath9 , and @xmath11-@xmath8-@xmath10-@xmath9 , in the notation of babson and steingrmsson  @xcite , which is explained in section  [ clumped sec ] .",
    "the author s counts of generic rectangulations , for small @xmath1 , are shown in table  [ comput table ] .",
    "for example , for each of the permutations @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the symbol  @xmath16 can be inserted anywhere except before the symbol @xmath17 .",
    "the sequences of letters for these permutations are respectively * * en**@xmath18*f * , * * nu**@xmath18*f * , * * e**@xmath18*ln * , and * * e**@xmath18*nf * , with a dot `` @xmath19 '' indicating an entry in the permutation that does not produce a letter .",
    "the respective strings are * enf * , * nuf * , * eln * , and again * enf*.    if we place the symbol @xmath20 before @xmath21 in @xmath22 or if we place @xmath20 after all entries of @xmath22 , we can construct the string of letters corresponding to the new permutation @xmath23 by the following procedure . insert the letter",
    "* n * in the string before the letter corresponding to @xmath21 or at the end of the string and alter letters before the insertion according to the following rule : * n * becomes * e * , * e * is unchanged , * f * becomes * l * , * l * is unchanged , and * u * is deleted .",
    "alter letters occurring after the insertion as follows : * n * becomes * f * , * e * becomes * u * , * f * is unchanged , * l * is deleted , and * u * is unchanged .",
    "now we can dispense with permutations entirely and simply insert letters into strings , counting the resulting strings by multiplicities .",
    "we start with the string * n * , encoding the permutation @xmath24 . inserting before or after the one letter in the string , we obtain * en * and",
    "* nf * , corresponding to the permutations @xmath25 . inserting into these two strings ,",
    "we obtain the strings * een * ( for @xmath26 ) , * enf * twice ( for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , * nuf * ( for @xmath29 ) , * eln * ( for @xmath30 ) , and * nff * ( for @xmath31 ) . in the next round of insertions , deletions of letters come into play , so that for example , inserting * n * after the * e * in * eln * , we obtain * enf*. this corresponds to inserting @xmath11 after @xmath8 in @xmath30 to obtain @xmath12 . in all",
    ", there are 15 strings which represent the 24 permutations in @xmath32 .",
    "the values shown in table  [ comput table ] are the results of a simple computer program that generates all strings and keeps track of multiplicities .",
    "in contrast , representing @xmath17-clumped permutations ( i.e.  twisted baxter permutations ) by strings leads to an enumeration formula . in this case the locations where",
    "@xmath20 can be inserted are the locations labeled * n * , * e * , or * f * , with the same definitions as above .",
    "when * n * is inserted into the string , the remainder of the string is altered as follows : before the insertion , * n * becomes * e * , * e * is unchanged , and * f * is deleted .",
    "after the insertion , * n * becomes * f * , * e * is deleted , and * f * is unchanged .",
    "all of the strings are of the form @xmath33 , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "define @xmath36 to be the multiplicity of the string @xmath33 for @xmath17-clumped permutations in @xmath7 .",
    "up to reindexing in @xmath1 , the numbers @xmath36 coincide with the numbers @xmath37 in @xcite , and the obvious recurrence on @xmath36 coincides with the recurrence on @xmath37 .",
    "this recurrence can be solved as in @xcite , or by the generating function method of  @xcite . in particular , the generating tree for the twisted baxter permutations is isomorphic to the generating tree for baxter permutations .",
    "indeed , the original proof @xcite that twisted baxter permutations biject with baxter permutations proceeded by establishing this isomorphism of generating trees .",
    "[ formula difficulties ] mallows @xcite gave a combinatorial interpretation for the terms in formula for @xmath38 by pointing out that the term indexed by @xmath39 counts baxter permutations with @xmath39 _ ascents _ ( or _ rises _ ) .",
    "there are two dual ways to define ascents : we will say that a _ right ascent _ is a pair of adjacent entries such that the left entry in the pair is smaller than the right entry in the pair . a _ left ascent _ is a pair of entries @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath41 appearing before @xmath40 in the permutation .",
    "we can similarly define _ right descents _",
    "( left entry in the pair larger ) and _ left descents _ ( @xmath41 appearing after @xmath40 ) .",
    "recall that the baxter permutation are the permutations avoiding @xmath9-@xmath42-@xmath8 and @xmath8-@xmath43-@xmath9 .",
    "it is easy to see that a given permutation is a baxter permutation if and only if its inverse is a baxter permutation .",
    "( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  4.2 ) . )",
    "thus , when counting baxter permutations according to the number of ascents , it does not matter whether we use right ascents or left ascents . furthermore , it is immediate that a permutation is a baxter permutation if and only if its reverse permutation is also a baxter permutation .",
    "thus the formula for baxter permutations with a fixed number of ascents is the same as the formula for baxter permutations with a fixed number of descents .",
    "it is easy to see that the number of ascents in a permutation  @xmath22 equals the number of vertical walls in the diagonal rectangulation @xmath44 .",
    "thus the formula for @xmath38 counts diagonal rectangulations according to the number of vertical walls .",
    "the number of left ascents of @xmath22 also equals the number of vertical walls in the generic rectangulation @xmath45 and the number of left descents of @xmath22 equals the number of horizontal walls .",
    "thus by the symmetry of the rectangulations , counting @xmath8-clumped permutations by left descents is equivalent to counting @xmath8-clumped permutations by left ascents .",
    "however , the inverse of a @xmath8-clumped permutation is not necessarily a @xmath8-clumped permutation , so it matters whether we take the left or right definitions of descents or ascents .",
    "thus there are at least three reasonable statistics by which to count : left ascents / descents , right ascents , or right descents .",
    "computations show that these three statistics are distributed differently , and suggest the following conjecture :    [ right desc conj ] fix @xmath46 .",
    "then for @xmath47 , the number of @xmath8-clumped permutations in @xmath7 with exactly @xmath48 right descents is a polynomial @xmath49 of degree @xmath50 and leading coefficient @xmath51    the polynomial @xmath49 must have factors @xmath52 , so the point is to determine the polynomial @xmath53 of degree @xmath54 that results when these factors are taken out .",
    "the first few polynomials appear to be @xmath55 , @xmath56 it should be emphasized that the point of the conjecture is to find a formula enumerating all @xmath8-clumped permutations .",
    "the conjecture can be proved for some small values of @xmath39 , and proofs for additional values of @xmath39 are of interest only to the extent to which they lead to a conjecture on the general form of @xmath49 .",
    "the other two statistics ( left ascents / descents and right ascents ) do not lead to polynomial formulas .",
    "in particular , counting @xmath8-clumped permutations by left ascents , or equivalently counting generic rectangulations by the number of vertical walls , appears to be hard .",
