    "exploration of the exotic baryons that have more than three constituent quarks is an important issue in hadron physics .",
    "recently , observation of two hidden - charm pentaquark - like structures @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath11 in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution in the process of @xmath12 decay was reported by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the values of the masses and widths from the fit with the breit  wigner parameterization are @xmath13  mev , @xmath14  mev , @xmath15  mev , and @xmath16 mev , with spin - parity @xmath17 being either @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "possible existence of such pentaquark states with hidden charm has already been predicted  @xcite prior to the experimental observation . in the earliest prediction",
    "@xcite , a @xmath5 s - wave bound state with @xmath20 was predicted to be around 4412 mev with @xmath21 as its largest decay mode , in the framework of the meson - baryon coupled channel unitary approach with the local hidden gauge formalism . in this approach",
    ", the @xmath22-channel vector meson exchange dominance is assumed for the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "taking into account of other meson exchanges , the mass of the predicted @xmath9 s - wave bound state could be shifted by @xmath23 mev  @xcite .",
    "considering coupled channel effects with @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels , three @xmath20 pentaquark states were predicted to be around 4334 mev , 4417 mev and 4481 mev , mainly coupled to @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath26 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore both @xmath0 and @xmath11 could be the predicted @xmath8 and @xmath27 states .",
    "the predicted masses for genuine pentaquark states with both negative and positive parity  @xcite suffer large model dependence , but also cover the observed masses of the two @xmath3 structures .",
    "after the observation of the two @xmath3 structures , many theoretical works have been triggered , see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , proposing various explanations for these structures . among them",
    ", it was suggested that the observed structures could be due to kinematical triangle singularities  @xcite , the possibility of which needs to be examined by future experiments .",
    "if these two @xmath3 structures correspond to two particle states , since they sit close to the mass thresholds of the @xmath24 and @xmath9 at 4387  mev and 4461  mev , respectively , a popular explanation for them is still either @xmath28-wave @xmath6 or @xmath5 molecular states  @xcite with @xmath29 , roughly consistent with previous predictions  @xcite but with parameters tuned to reproduce the observed masses of @xmath30 structures .",
    "however , the observed decay width of the @xmath0 state is about a few times larger than the predicted one  @xcite .",
    "also the lhcb experiment claims that the two states have opposite parity , which is against that both states are s - wave molecules of @xmath31 to have spin - parity of @xmath32 .    in this work , we want to make an estimate of the partial decay widths of the @xmath10 into the @xmath1 and @xmath2 assuming it be a hadronic molecular state . we will point out that the previous prediction  @xcite for the decay width of @xmath6 bound state underestimates the contribution of the @xmath1 decay by more than an order of magnitude due to its assumption of vector meson exchange dominance . rather than the @xmath2 mode",
    ", the dominant decay mode for a @xmath6 bound state should be @xmath1 due to @xmath22-channel pion exchange .",
    "we demonstrate that the relative ratio of the decays of hidden charm @xmath3 pentaquark states to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are very different for @xmath3 to be @xmath6 or @xmath5 molecular states .",
    "while the @xmath4 molecule decays dominantly into the @xmath33 , the @xmath5 molecule has a larger branching fraction for the decay into the @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , were the @xmath34 structures hadronic molecular states , future measurement of this ratio can help us to pin down their nature .",
    "the unexpected large decay width of the @xmath0 can get a natural explanation if it is a @xmath6 molecule .",
    "this article is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the theoretical framework of our calculation . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the numerical results and some discussions are presented .",
    "among the two observed structures , the existence of the narrow @xmath35 , no matter what it is , is affirmative from the data for the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution .",
    "however , introducing the second structure , the @xmath10 , does not seem that necessary since there is still a discrepancy between the best fit with two @xmath34 structures and the data in the right shoulder of the peak in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution .",
    "yet , a recent phenomenological analysis of the data affirms the necessity of introducing the @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the nominal mass of the @xmath10 is just 7 mev below the @xmath8 threshold and 81 mev below @xmath36 threshold .",
    "it seems more natural to be a @xmath8 dominant molecule  @xcite",
    ". however the possibility to be a deeply bounded @xmath9 state can not be excluded  @xcite . here , we assume the @xmath0 exists with the properties reported by the lhcb collaboration , and study its decays to the two final states @xmath37 and @xmath2 with the assumption that it is a bound state of @xmath4 ( type i ) or @xmath5 ( type ii ) .",
    "these two decays can proceed through triangular diagrams as shown in fig  [ fig : feyndiag ] .",
    "since we only aim at making a rough estimate , which is sufficient for the conclusion , we only consider the exchange of lightest possible mesons .",
    "this means that we will consider the one - pion - exchange , as well as the one - rho - exchange in previous work  @xcite , between the charmed baryons and anti - charmed mesons , and the exchange of ground state pseudoscalar and vector charmed mesons , which are related to each other via heavy quark spin symmetry , for the decays into the @xmath2 .",

    "the partial decay width of the two - body decay of the @xmath10 state in its rest frame is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mass of the @xmath10 , while @xmath57 is the @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) three - momentum in the rest frame of the @xmath10 .",

    "the partial decay width is proportional to @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the cases of type i and type ii , respectively , which are canceled in the calculation of the ratio @xmath70 defined as @xmath71 for the case of type i and @xmath72 for the case of type ii . using the values of the coupling constants given in table  [ table : para ] ,",

    "[ fig : result ] ]    one sees that the dependence of both ratios on the cutoff is rather weak .",
    "the partial decay width of the @xmath34 into the @xmath74 is much larger than that into the @xmath2 for the type i hadronic molecule , while the situation is different for type ii . because the @xmath34 structures were observed by the lhcb collaboration in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution ,",
    "our results show that the @xmath34 should be copiously produced in @xmath75 and thus can be easily searched for by reconstructing events for @xmath58 and @xmath76 if it is a type  i hadronic molecule .",
    "therefore , this ratio can be employed to tell the nature of the @xmath34 resonances in the future experiments , such as experiments at lhcb , the @xmath77 experiments at jlab  @xcite , or the @xmath78 experiments at jparc  @xcite .",
    "it is a firm conclusion that the partial width of @xmath79 for the @xmath10 being a @xmath8 hadronic molecule is much larger than the @xmath80 hadronic molecular case",
    ". this conclusion does not depend on any unknown coupling constant , and is analyzed in details using the nonrelativistic formalism taking heavy quark spin symmetry into account in appendix  [ app : nr ] .",
    "we also find that the ratio @xmath70 is insensitive to the mass of the @xmath34 in the range between 4.36  gev and 4.50  gev which covers the locations of both lhcb @xmath34 structures .",
    "yet , we need to notice that because of the mass , the @xmath35 , located 10  mev below the @xmath36 threshold , can not be a @xmath81 bound state .     for the @xmath10 being a @xmath51 hadronic molecule .",
    "[ fig:3bodydiag ] ]    a hadronic molecule with unstable constituents can decay naturally through the decays of its constituents .",
    "however , the widths of @xmath82 are small , which leads to small three - body decay widths for the @xmath34 . for instance , the three - body decay @xmath83 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3bodydiag ] leads to a width of only 7.3  mev , much smaller than the reported width of the @xmath10 .",
    "here we evaluated the value of the coupling @xmath84 using  @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath56 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the masses of @xmath34 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , and @xmath90 is the binding energy , which is valid for an @xmath28-wave shallow bound state . here",
    "we have introduced the factor @xmath91 to account for the normalization of fermion fields in comparison with the formula used in , e.g. ref .  @xcite . if we take the mass of the @xmath34 as 4.38  gev , then @xmath92 .",
    "the large value of @xmath93 makes possible that the @xmath51 molecule decays dominantly into the @xmath94 rather than the three - body tree - level decay mode .",
    "we can make an order - of - magnitude estimate of @xmath95 for type  i hadronic molecule .",
    "taking the cutoff to be in the range between 0.7  gev and 1.2  gev , which reflects the intrinsic model dependence because of the uv divergence of the loop integrals , the partial width in question could be as large as @xmath96 . the nonrelativistic formalism with a gaussian form factor as described in appendix  [ app : nr ] leads to the same conclusion .",
    "it is worthy to mention that our results also depend on the values of those coupling constants shown in table  [ table : para ] , and some of them are obtained from flavor @xmath97 .",
    "fortunately , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : result ] , the magnitude of @xmath70 for type i and type ii are different by more than an order of magnitude , hence even if these values only present a rough estimate of the real values of the coupling constants , our main conclusion should still be valid . the large decay branching ratio of the @xmath8 molecule to @xmath98 results in a much larger decay width than that of the @xmath9 molecule .",
    "furthermore , the nominal mass of the @xmath10 is just a few mev below the @xmath8 threshold .",
    "these properties makes more plausible to explain the @xmath10 as a @xmath8 hadronic molecule than a @xmath27 one .    in summary , we have studied the decays of hidden charm pentaquark @xmath0 state to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , assuming that its quantum numbers are @xmath20 , under the hadronic molecular assumption of either @xmath51 or @xmath36 .",
    "the two decays can be described by means of the triangle diagrams where the two constituents of the @xmath3 can exchange the pseudoscalar and vector mesons leading to the @xmath2 or @xmath1 final states .",
    "we estimate the ratio of these two decay modes .",
    "the results show that its value is sensitive to the ansatz of whether the @xmath3 is a @xmath4 bound state or a @xmath5 bound state .",
