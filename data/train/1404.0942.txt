    "they are used by a number of major conservation organizations and have resulted in alarming headline figures such as the mean @xmath0 decline in abundance of terrestrial vertebrate populations between 1970 and 2000 @xcite .",
    "i will refer to the property measured by these indices as `` size '' change .",
    "it is obvious that there are other aspects of change in the abundances of species in a community , which may also be of both theoretical and applied interest .",
    "i will concentrate on one of these :    `` shape '' change is `` change in the relative abundances of species in a community ''",
    "@xcite , where the relative abundance of a species is its abundance divided by the sum of abundances of all species in the community .",
    "[ def : ratesuc ]    @xcite used definition [ def : ratesuc ] as part of a definition of succession , and measuring the rate of change in relative abundances is an important aspect of testing theories about succession ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in this manuscript i avoid the term `` succession '' , because it has been associated with a much wider set of changes in communities and ecosystems @xcite .",
    "a number of measures of the rate of shape change have been proposed @xcite , and measures developed for other purposes @xcite have also been used to measure shape change .",
    "nevertheless , there has been little systematic consideration of how such a measure should behave , or of the connection to size change .",
    "i believe that the field would benefit from the kind of systematic approach that has been applied to measures of evenness ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and other aspects of diversity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , i first outline the properties that a measure of rate of shape change should have .",
    "this gives a rough idea of how a suitable measure can be derived .",
    "after deriving such a measure , i show that it has two simple interpretations : first , as proportional to the aitchison distance @xcite between two sets of relative abundance data ; and second , as the among - species sample standard deviation of mean proportional population growth rates over a finite time period .",
    "note that the proportional growth rate for a species with positive abundance @xmath1 at time @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 , assuming that @xmath1 is differentiable with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "i define the growth space of a community as a real space whose axes represent proportional growth rates of each species .",
    "i show that the new measure of rate of shape change and the living planet index @xcite are proportional to the lengths of projections onto orthogonal subspaces of growth space , and thus measure distinct aspects of community dynamics .",
    "the geometry of growth space leads to the results that body size , generation time and environmental variability have no necessary connection to the rate of shape change .",
    "i illustrate the calculation of the rate of shape change using data on hoverflies in a garden in leicester , uk .",
    "i then extend the approach to deal with colonization and extinction , making use of the surreal number system , which includes quantities further from and closer to zero than any real number @xcite .",
    "the surreal numbers are useful because , for example , an extinction should represent a larger change than any reduction in abundance that does not involve extinction , and yet such reductions can lead to arbitrarily large real numbers .",
    "i apply this extended method to the higher plant community on the volcanic island of surtsey .",
    "finally , i discuss the hypothesis that phylogenetically - restricted assemblages will show a relatively high proportion of size change compared to diverse communities .",

    "major symbols used in both main text and appendices",
    ". quantities for which no dimensions are indicated are dimensionless .",
    "abundances are shown as dimensionless here , although in some cases they will have dimensions such as numbers per unit area . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , i list the properties that i believe a measure of the rate of shape change should have in order to match up with biological intuition .",
    "if we accept these properties , we will know a lot about what a suitable measure should look like , even before we have attempted to derive it .",
    "it is of course true that others might choose a different list of properties , and thus arrive at measures that will be useful for different purposes .    1 .",
    "[ property : ratefunc ] by definition [ def : ratesuc ] , the rate of shape change should be expressible as a function of relative abundances and time alone . although not explicit in the definition , i will here be concerned with scalar measures of rate ( in physical terms , `` speed '' rather than `` velocity '' ) .",
    "this is needed because one will often want to make comparisons of rates between communities containing different sets of species , which can not be done if the rate has multiple components , each associated with a particular species or group of species .",
    "+ if the community consists of @xmath4 species ( not all of which may be observed at a particular time ) , then denote by @xmath5 a measure of the abundance of the @xmath6th species , @xmath7 .",

    "although it is necessary that a rate of shape change can be expressed in terms of relative abundances and time alone , many other necessary properties are easier to interpret in terms of absolute abundances .",
    "2 .   [ property : timefunc ] the rate should be a mean rate of change over a finite time interval . this is required if such a rate is to be calculated from observations taken at discrete points in time .",
    "furthermore , it is often useful to average out stochastic variability in community composition , so as to focus on underlying trends .",
    "+ given observations at the start and end of a time interval @xmath11 $ ] and the intuitive concept of speed , the rate of shape change should be a function of the form @xmath12 this means that we need only find a suitable way of measuring the difference between two abundance vectors .",
    "3 .   [ property : scaleinvar ] defining shape change as change in relative rather than absolute abundances ( definition [ def : ratesuc ] ) means that it should not be altered if all abundances at a given time are multiplied by a constant .",
    "in other words , @xmath13 any function of a composition satisfying equation [ eq : scaleinvar ] is expressible in terms of ratios of the form @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this property also means that we can work with samples from which absolute abundance data are not available ( which can apply to everything from light traps to environmental sequencing ) .",

    "[ property : neutral ] if all species have the same proportional growth rate , relative abundances do not change , and the rate of shape change should be zero .",
    "this is the important special case of a deterministic neutral community .",
    "if equations [ eq : scaleinvar ] and [ eq : nochange ] hold , setting @xmath20 in equation 1 shows that this will be the case . in all other cases ,",
    "the rate should not be zero .",
    "in other words , @xmath21 7 .   [ property : perturbinvar ] the rate of shape change should be the same for all abundance trajectories having the same vector of proportional changes over some specified time interval .",
    "this is both the most important and the most difficult requirement to grasp , and is needed in order to make the rate of shape change consistent with the way in which population growth is measured . + for a single species , the same amount of proportional growth has occurred if the population of that species increases from 1 to 10 as if it increases from 10 to 100 units .",
    "this can be justified at the individual level by considering the population as a birth - death process .",
    "if the population changes by the same proportion in each case , then any individual experiences the same balance between proportional birth and death rates .",
    "similarly , for a set of three species , the amount of proportional change from @xmath22^{\\prime}$ ] ( where the prime denotes transpose ) to @xmath23^{\\prime}$ ] is the same as from @xmath24^{\\prime}$ ] to @xmath25^{\\prime}$ ] , and from @xmath26^{\\prime}$ ] to @xmath27^{\\prime}$ ] .",

    "are sets of points for which the species has the same proportional growth rate , and therefore experiences an environment of equivalent quality .",
    "this idea extends the concept of the hutchinson niche , which is bounded by the level set of zero proportional growth rate @xcite .",
    "a scaling @xmath30 applied to an abundance trajectory does not alter the proportional growth rate for any species at any time , and therefore should not alter a measure that tells us about how organisms experience change .",
    "+ an unrelated but important practical consequence of scaling invariance is that there is no need to measure abundance in the same units for every species , provided that the same units are used for a given species at all time points .",
    "for example , the abundance of one species could be measured in percentage cover , and that of another species in numbers trapped in a pitfall trap , without affecting the value of a scaling invariant measure of rate of change . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath30 can be thought of as representing the conversion factors needed to put all abundances in the same units , and if equation [ eq : perturbinvar ] holds , @xmath30 does not need to be known . similarly , if detection probabilities differ among species but remain constant over time , they do not affect the value of a scaling invariant measure of rate of change ( although if detection probabilities change over time in different ways for different species , such a measure will be affected ) .",
    "+ there is one obvious objection to the idea that change should be measured on a proportional scale : it might be argued that the proportional scale gives too much weight to rare species .",
    "many important properties of communities and ecosystems can be approximated as functions of abundance .",
    "examples include the structural complexity of the community , the rate of primary production , and the conservation value of the community .",
    "the simplest plausible functions relating these properties to abundance are linear combinations of abundances , where each species has a weight that measures the contribution of a unit of abundance of that species to the function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the abundance of a rare species is doubled , many of these properties might be almost unchanged .",
    "in contrast , doubling the abundance of a common species might result in large changes in these properties .",
    "+ there are two answers to this objection .",
    "first , a scaling invariant function must give equal weight to every species ( [ ap : maxinvar ] ) .",
    "thus , the decision to take an organism - centred view of temporal dynamics ( which leads to scaling invariance ) precludes also taking the ecosystem function - centred view outlined above .",
    "second , i believe that if changes in ecosystem function are of interest , they should be studied directly , rather than through using change in abundances as a surrogate .",
    "rare species will sometimes be important to ecosystem function .",
    "for example , a rare but very large tree species might have a big effect on structural complexity , a rare keystone predator might have a big indirect effect on primary production , and a rare but endangered organism such as a rhinoceros might have a big effect on conservation value .",
    "thus , it is meaningless to talk about a measure that gives `` too much weight '' to a rare species unless the right weight to give each species is known .",
    "if the weights are known , the appropriate function can be studied .",
    "if the weights are unknown , studying abundances will be misleading .",
    "even the simplest families of population growth models such as the exponential and the logistic are not closed under addition @xcite .",
    "thus , a weighted sum of abundances of populations , each growing according to a different member of such a family , will have qualitatively different behaviour from any member of the family . in summary ,",
    "changes in abundance should be studied only if they are of interest in their own right , not as a surrogate for some other property .",
    "+ exponential growth is an important idealized case in population dynamics , playing a similar role in population biology to that of a body with no forces acting on it in newtonian physics @xcite .",
    "it also provides an easy way to demonstrate whether a measure of the rate of shape change could be scaling invariant . in this special case , each population experiences an environment of constant quality , and grows at a constant proportional rate . in other words",
    "all relevant aspects of the system have either zero or non - zero but constant proportional rates of change .",
    "a necessary but not sufficient condition for scaling invariance is that a measure of the rate of shape change is constant over time when every species is growing exponentially ( [ ap : invariance ] ) .",
    "the measures of rate of shape change in common use @xcite are not constant over time under exponential growth ( figure [ fig : succession]a and [ ap : existing ] ) , and are therefore not scaling invariant .",

    "[ property : richness ] a measure of the rate of shape change should not depend ( in a statistical sense ) on the number of species being studied .",
    "this is important for two reasons .",
    "first , it is usually impossible to measure the abundance of every species in the community .",
    "if instead we have abundances for a random sample of species , then a measure whose expected value does not depend on the number of species sampled can be used to estimate the rate of shape change in the entire community . in general",
    ", it will be difficult to obtain a random sample of species .",
    "selecting species at random from a complete species list is rarely possible .",
    "choosing individuals at random and identifying them does not give a random sample of species , because more abundant species are more likely to be included in the sample .",
    "in practice , available data are often used without any attempt at random sampling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , independence of the number of species studied remains a desirable statistical property .",
    "+ second , we will often want to compare communities with different numbers of species .",
    "other things being equal , there is no intuitive reason why a change in the number of species should be associated with a change in the rate of shape change .",
    "in what follows , i initially restrict attention to cases where there is no colonization or extinction , so that all abundances are positive .",
    "i later show how to deal with colonization and extinction in a way that is consistent with the approach taken below .",

    "the mean proportional growth rate over the time interval @xmath53 $ ] is @xmath54 ( throughout , @xmath55 denotes the natural logarithm ) . the requirement that @xmath1 is differentiable is not much of a limitation , because even in stochastic models where abundance may not be differentiable",

    "* and 81 ) .",
    "all these measures are based on the exponential of the among - species mean of mean proportional growth rates .",
    "they reveal patterns of major conservation importance , such as the mean 25@xmath65 decline in terrestrial vertebrate populations between 1970 and 2000 @xcite , and the mean 77@xmath65 decline in species of conservation priority in the united kingdom between 1970 and 2010 @xcite .",
    "such declines do not necessarily involve shape change in the sense of definition [ def : ratesuc ] : if all species decline at the same rate , fewer organisms are present in total , but their relative abundances are unchanged . to understand the connection between shape change and these measures of biodiversity trends , i introduce the idea of the growth space of a community . for a given set of species ,",

    "this norm is zero if the community is at equilibrium , and positive otherwise .",
    "i refer to it as the `` activity '' level of the community ( with dimensions time@xmath78 ) .",
    "to make comparisons among communities , the scaled activity @xmath79 is useful because its expected value does not depend on the number of species sampled .",
    "second , @xmath80 ( figure [ fig : projection ] ) measures the proportion of change that is size change .",
    "the value of @xmath81 is a useful way of comparing the dynamics of communities because it is dimensionless , and does not depend on the number of species in the community . in terms of linear models",
    ", @xmath81 is the coefficient of determination for a one - dimensional linear model containing only a mean term @xcite .",
    "the geometry of growth space makes it easy to visualize some properties of the rate of shape change ( figure [ fig : projection ] ) , and leads to important theoretical results .",
    "as already mentioned , the rate of shape change is zero along the line @xmath82 ( figure [ fig : projection ] , solid line ) .",
    "thus , the community can increase or decrease in total abundance without shape change , by remaining on this line .",
    "lines parallel to the @xmath82 line ( figure [ fig : projection ] , dotted lines ) have constant rate of shape change , increasing away from the @xmath82 line in each direction . at the origin",

    "if all species had positive abundance for such a community , and growth rates remained at a fixed point on the bold half - lines , the community would asymptotically approach a boundary equilibrium at which the species with negative growth rates were absent .",
    "since such points do not lie on the @xmath67 line , the rate of shape change would not go to zero as the equilibrium was approached ( although such situations are unlikely to be common , and species with very low abundance would eventually go extinct , as discussed later ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible ( although not necessarily true ) that there are corresponding effects on mean proportional growth rates in the field .",
    "nevertheless , it is only the among - species standard deviation of mean proportional growth rates that determines how fast the relative abundances change . in consequence",
    ", there is no reason to assume that shape change must be faster in , for example , a microbial community than in a forest .",
    "if shape change is generally faster in microbial than plant communities @xcite , it is not simply because microbes have faster growth rates .",
    "similarly , although there may be a relationship between body size and the rate of shape change , as @xcite suggested in the broader context of succession , it is not a mathematical necessity .",
    "second , environmental variability _",

    "environmental variability only affects the rate of shape change if it affects different species in different ways .",

    "large , active species are thought to be trapped less efficiently than small species @xcite .",

    "i will return to the ecological meaning that can be extracted from these patterns after developing methods to deal with colonization and extinction .",
    "so far , i assumed that abundances are strictly positive ( or at least that the underlying expected abundances are positive , if sampling zeros occurred ) . even in cases where a complete census has been conducted",
    ", one could think of the set of individuals present as being a single realization of a stochastic process with positive expected abundances .",
    "thus , treating absences as sampling zeros will usually be appropriate .",
    "nevertheless , true zeros may occur , with a transition from a true zero to a positive abundance representing colonization and a transition from positive abundance to true zero representing extinction .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the following analysis provides a link to related measures for presence / absence data .",
    "if abundance @xmath89 of some species is zero , the proportional growth rate @xmath90 is undefined .",
    "this has important practical consequences .",
    "for example , the watchlist indicator @xcite is closely related to the rate of change in size ( equation [ eq : rbar ] ) for species of conservation priority",
    ". it would be undefined if one or more of the species of interest went extinct , yet such an event would be of even more concern than a decline in abundance without extinction .",
    "looking at the form of the mean proportional growth rate ( equation [ eq : meanrate ] ) suggests an approach . in the following explanation ,",
    "i focus on extinction , because colonization is simply the mirror image .",
    "intuitively , suppose that we would like an index based on a weighted sum of two terms , one reflecting changes in abundance measured on a proportional scale , and the other reflecting extinctions .",
    "the mean proportional growth rate ( equation [ eq : meanrate ] ) involves @xmath91 , and @xmath92 . choosing a real weight for extinctions",
    "is equivalent to adding an arbitrary constant to an observed zero , and it is in principle possible for abundance to be positive but less than this constant .",
    "thus for every real choice of weight given to the extinction component and given initial abundance @xmath93 , there is a positive abundance @xmath94 for which the magnitude of the mean proportional growth rate is greater than this weight . in other words , for any finite weight given to extinctions , there will be changes in abundance not involving extinction that count for more than changes involving extinction , which is intuitively unreasonable .",
    "therefore the weight given to an extinction should have greater magnitude than any real number .    simply calling",
    "the weight given to an extinction infinite is not satisfactory . intuitively , one would like the extinction of a common species to represent a larger change than the extinction of a rare species . also , one would like the transition from a given non - zero abundance to zero abundance to represent a more negative rate of change if it occurs over a shorter time interval @xmath37 .",
    "arithmetic operations involving infinite quantities are not defined in the real number field , so these properties will not hold .",
    "there is a a natural solution .",
    "instead of replacing zero abundances by @xmath95 , replace them by a number larger than zero but smaller than all positive real numbers .",
    "such numbers exist in the surreal number field @xcite , and their logarithms have magnitude greater than all positive real numbers .",
    "the surreal number field contains the real numbers , but has arithmetic operations defined for infinite as well as finite numbers .",
    "these operations behave as expected when applied to real numbers .",
    "if a species has nonzero abundance at time @xmath2 but zero abundance at time @xmath96 , define its mean proportional growth rate as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the simplest number that is greater than zero but smaller than all positive real numbers @xcite . under this definition ,",
    "the mean proportional growth rate is more negative if @xmath93 is larger , or if @xmath37 is smaller , as required .",
    "the size and shape components of the rate of change for a community can then be calculated as described in [ ap : ce ] .",
    "the size component becomes a surreal number with an infinite and a real part : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the number of colonizations , @xmath101 is the number of extinctions , @xmath102 is the negative of the natural logarithm of @xmath98 ( and is larger than all positive real numbers ) , @xmath103 is the sum of log abundances for all species with nonzero abundance at time @xmath96 , and @xmath104 is the sum of log abundances for all species with nonzero abundance at time @xmath2",
    ". equation [ eq : sizeinf ] reduces to equation [ eq : rbar ] if there are no colonizations or extinctions .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath105 in equation [ eq : sizeinf ] is the among - species mean of a variable taking the values @xmath106 for extinctions , @xmath43 for colonizations , and zero otherwise ( [ ap : pa ] ) .",
    "if the difference between the numbers of colonizations and extinctions is not zero , the magnitude of this term will always be greater than the magnitude of the second term ( the real part , proportional to @xmath107 ) . to understand how equation [ eq : sizeinf ] works ,",
    "consider a case where a community loses one species but gains another , whose final abundance is the same as the initial abundance of the lost species .",
    "no other species change abundance .",
    "intuitively , there has been no change in size .",
    "if the species gained has lower final abundance than the species lost , there has been a reduction in size , but not as large as if a species was lost and no new species , however rare , colonized .",
    "if there are extinctions and colonizations , the shape component also has infinite and real parts : @xmath108^{1/2}}\\delta t } , \\label{eq : sdinf}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the sets of species going extinct and colonizing , respectively .",
    "equation [ eq : sdinf ] is approximate in the sense that it ignores terms whose magnitude is less than any positive real number .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath105 in equation [ eq : sdinf ] is the among - species standard deviation of a variable taking the values @xmath106 for extinctions , @xmath43 for colonizations , and zero otherwise ( [ ap : pa ] ) .",
    "thus the infinite part will be large if there is a lot of change in the set of species present ( @xmath112 is large ) , but there is little change in the number of species present ( @xmath113 is small ) .",
    "the second term in equation [ eq : sdinf ] ( the real part ) will be large if the species going extinct had large abundances at time @xmath2 and/or the species colonizing had large abundances at time @xmath96 .",
    "the scaled activity level and the proportion of change that is size change in the presence of colonizations and extinctions can be calculated as described in [ ap : ce ] .",
    "because standard probability distributions are not defined over the whole of the surreal number field , and there is so far no generally satisfactory definition of an integral for surreal functions @xcite , parametric statistical analyses of these quantities would be difficult .",
    "however , surreal numbers can be ranked unambiguously ( [ ap : ce ] ) , and so statistics based on ranks of the scaled activity level and of the proportion of change that is size change are straightforward .",
    "if only presence / absence data are available , only the infinite terms in equations [ eq : sizeinf ] and [ eq : sdinf ] can be calculated .",

    "ap : pa ] summarizes the calculation of scaled activity and proportion of change that is size change from presence - absence data .",
    "the measures of rate of succession from presence / absence data defined by @xcite are based on rescalings of @xmath114 , which is proportional to the squared activity level from presence / absence data ( [ ap : pa ] ) .",
    "i calculated the rate of shape change @xmath61 ( equation [ eq : sdinf ] ) and the among - species mean proportional growth rate @xmath88 ( equation [ eq : sizeinf ] ) for the higher plant community on the volcanic island of surtsey , using data and background information from @xcite .",
    "the island was formed in 1963 , and its higher plant community has been surveyed annually since the first plant was found in 1965 , initially by complete census , and later by quadrat and transect samples @xcite .",
    "relatively few plant species are found on the island , because of the scarcity of water , low nutrient levels , salt spray , sand abrasion , and wave action @xcite . however , soil formation has been fairly rapid , due to organic matter being washed ashore @xcite .",
    "i used the data for 1965 to 1981 in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "data from later years were excluded because there was no count for the most abundant species after 1981 . by 1981 , 22 taxa had been observed , including one that was identified only to genus and a category of unidentified plants .",
    "there were many zero values .",
    "it is plausible that abundances were exactly known , and therefore that zeros represent true absences ( at least during the early part of the study , when complete censuses were made ) .",
    "the counts themselves can only take natural number values , so can not be differentiable functions of time .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to treat expected abundances conditional on the data ( which coincide with the counts at sampling times ) as differentiable functions of time , and therefore to calculate the rates of change in size and shape using equations [ eq : sizeinf ] and [ eq : sdinf ] respectively .",

    "species arrived at different times , with dispersal by birds probably the most common route @xcite .",

    "the most striking feature of the temporal pattern in @xmath88 is that it does not increase systematically over time , despite changes in the environment that might be expected to favour plant growth .",
    "for example , over the last two time periods , the abundance of the dominant species _",
    "honckenya peploides _ , and the total number of individuals , were increasing rapidly .",
    "biomass production and soil fertility , driven by inputs of fish waste and guano from seabirds , were also increasing @xcite . furthermore , as the abundance of _ h. peploides _ increased , dense stands of this plant modified the environment in ways that increased the germination and survival rates of two other species @xcite , an example of the type of positive interaction thought to be important in facilitating succession @xcite . nevertheless , both the infinite and real parts of @xmath88 were lower in the last two time periods than in much of the first half of the series .",
    "in other words , for a typical species , the environment was less favourable at the end than the start of the time series .",
    "the rate of change in shape , @xmath61 ( equation [ eq : sdinf ] ) had relatively high values in the middle of the study period ( figure [ fig : surtseysurreal]c ) .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig : surtseysurreal]a shows that in the middle part of the series , there were relatively large numbers of colonizations and extinctions ( values of @xmath86 changing to and from zero ) .",
    "simultaneous colonizations and extinctions tend to make the infinite part of @xmath61 large ( figure [ fig : surtseysurreal]c , dots connected by lines ) .",
    "there was little obvious temporal pattern in the real part of @xmath61 ( figure [ fig : surtseysurreal]c , arrows , on a separate scale magnified by a factor of @xmath117 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : surtseysurreal]a shows that at most time points , there was substantial among - species variability in changes in abundance .",
    "at least over this time scale , the idea that rates of shape change are decreasing over time is not supported . in retrospect",
    "this is unsurprising , because as figures [ fig : succession]c and d show , it is easy to construct cases in which rates of change are not decreasing over time in the short term .",
    "the amount of change in the surtsey plant community was almost always not commensurate with that in the leicester hoverfly assemblage , in the sense that colonization and extinction represent infinitely larger changes than any change in abundance not involving such events .",
    "nevertheless , the proportion of change that is size change ( @xmath81 ) can be directly compared ( figure [ fig : hovervssurtseybox ] ) .",
    "this proportion was strikingly higher for the leicester hoverfly assemblage ( median 0.22 , lower quartile 0.07 , upper quartile 0.35 ) than for the surtsey higher plant community ( median 0.05 , lower quartile 0.02 , upper quartile 0.09 ) , although a hypothesis test is not appropriate because no hypothesis was proposed before looking at the data .",
    "in general , one might expect phylogenetically restricted assemblages of organisms such as the leicester hoverflies to show larger amounts of size change than more diverse assemblages of organisms such as the surtsey higher plants .",
    "this is because if there is strong niche conservatism @xcite , closely - related species will tend to have similar proportional growth rates under most sets of environmental conditions , and when proportional growth rates are similar , @xmath81 will tend to be large ( figure [ fig : projection ] ) .",
    "conversely , in a diverse assemblage , it is unlikely that all species will have similar proportional growth rates under most sets of environmental conditions , and @xmath81 will generally be small .",
    "thus , in diverse assemblages , indices of size change such as the living planet index may be relatively uninformative about community dynamics .",
    "i will not attempt to test this hypothesis here , because such a test will require data from a wide range of assemblages of differing taxonomic diversity , but it is closely connected to the idea that compensatory dynamics ( predominantly positive interspecific covariances in abundance ) will occur in assemblages where many species are functionally equivalent @xcite .    ) for higher plants on surtsey ( 17 annual time intervals : infinitesimal parts not shown ) and hoverflies in a leicester , uk , garden ( 29 annual time intervals , bootstrap mean values plotted ) .",
    "thick line : median .",
    "box extends from the lower to the upper hinges , which are approximately the lower and upper quartiles .",
    "whiskers extend from the ends of the box to the furthest observations no more than 1.5 times the width of the box away.,height=680 ]    in summary , the surtsey higher plant data illustrate how patterns in size change may not accord with simple perceptions of the favourability of an environment , and do not support the idea that rates of shape change will generally be decreasing over time .",
    "change in shape was much more important in the surtsey higher plant assemblage than in the leicester hoverfly assemblage .",
    "here , i have derived a measure of the rate of shape change ( in the sense of definition [ def : ratesuc ] ) that is consistent with the basic principles of population dynamics and takes an organism - centred view .",
    "the most important result is that if two abundance trajectories have the same proportional growth rates at corresponding time points , they are equivalent from an organism s point of view , and should therefore have the same rate of shape change .",
    "it may seem surprising that equal proportional changes make equal contributions to the rate of shape change ( and to indices of biodiversity change such as the living planet index ) whether they occur in rare or common species .",
    "thus , shape change could be rapid in a community whose dominant species do not change in abundance .",
    "population biologists have accepted the idea that the proportional scale is appropriate for analyses of single - species dynamics @xcite . a reluctance to apply the same logic at the community level ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might imply that some variable other than the composition of the community is in fact of primary interest .",
    "such variables might include total biomass or its distribution among species , nutrients , phylogenetic diversity , or structural complexity .",
    "these are all important aspects of a broader concept of succession .",
    "nevertheless , one should not object to a measure of the rate of shape change on the grounds that it does not describe the rate of change of some other variable .",
    "the properties studied by community ecologists ( such as abundances ) and the properties studied by ecosystem ecologists ( such as biomass , nutrients , and structural complexity ) may behave in quite different ways .",
    "other interesting measures of community dynamics could be obtained under different invariance principles .",
    "for example , one might argue that for a single population , all points on the same logistic growth curve are equivalent in the long term . under this argument , one would want a measure ( such as the carrying capacity ) that indexes long - term behaviour rather than short - term dynamics .",
    "there are two key differences from the approach taken in this manuscript .",
    "first , situations that will be equivalent in the long term are not equivalent from an organism s point of view .",
    "instead , they might represent equivalence in properties such as long - term conservation value .",
    "second , such an approach requires a parameterized model of community dynamics .",
    "there are fairly simple and general stochastic models of community dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they will not apply to all situations .",
    "the model would ( i think ) have to be parameterized , because it would be difficult to find a useful measure that was invariant over the space spanned by all members of a family of models , rather than the space spanned by a particular member of that family .",
    "there is a similar issue with measures of physiological time .",
    "it is easy to find a physiological time scale on which some process such as organism growth has a constant proportional rate , but impossible to find a universal time scale on which all relevant processes will have this property @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the approach used here does not rely on any parameterized model of community dynamics ( other than in the trivial sense that because we do not usually know abundances exactly , we have to use a model to estimate proportional growth rates )",
    ".    there may be a deeper connection between measures of diversity and measures of the rate of shape change .",
    "diversity indices are scalar summaries of a relative abundance vector , while measures of the rate of shape change are scalar summaries of changes in relative abundance vectors .",
    "most diversity indices can be expressed in terms of hill numbers , a family of functions indexed by the weight they give to evenness @xcite .",
    "there are generalizations that account for functional or taxonomic similarity @xcite .",
    "the obvious place to look for a connection between the concepts of diversity and rate of shape change is beta diversities , which measure differences in diversity between communities .",
    "beta diversities based on hill numbers unify a wide range of measures of community similarity @xcite , including the jaccard and morisita - horn indices used by @xcite to measure temporal change in communities .",
    "they are not scaling invariant ( m. spencer , unpublished results , unless no weight is given to evenness , in which they only measure colonization and extinction ) , but the possibility of a less obvious connection remains .",
    "traditionally , multivariate community ecology has focussed on variation among sites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even when samples form a time series , the usual approach is to analyze them in `` abundance space '' , where each observation represents the abundance vector at a single time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is implicitly a static view of communities , in which abundance is directly determined by environmental conditions .",
    "it is in conflict with the dominant view in population dynamics that environmental conditions act on the proportional growth rate of a species , rather than directly on its abundance @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the decomposition of patterns of change into size and shape components gives an ecologically meaningful low - dimensional representation of dynamics , which may offer a useful alternative to traditional ordination .",
    "furthermore , it can be extended to deal with colonizations and extinctions , or to data on presence / absence alone .",
    "related work includes the regression method used by @xcite to study the responses of communities to long - term directional perturbations , although this focusses on responses of mean abundance to environmental change , rather than on decomposing empirical patterns of proportional growth rates .    what could measures of size and shape change be used for ?",
    "one obvious idea is to quantify global patterns in community change .",
    "there is evidence of global variation in size change in vertebrate assemblages since 1970 @xcite .",
    "for example , among terrestrial species , tropical populations appear to be declining while temperate populations are increasing .",
    "for marine species , populations in the southern and indian oceans appear to be declining , while populations in the pacific and atlantic are relatively stable .",
    "thus , there is clearly shape change as well as size change at the global scale , and some of this change can be explained by simple geographical differences .",
    "similarly , among insects there was an overall 45@xmath65 decline in abundance between 1970 and 2010 , but declines were less severe in lepidoptera than in other insects @xcite . the geometric approach taken here shows that we can think of the living planet index and related indices as being based on a one - dimensional linear model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "rather than fitting separate one - dimensional models for subgroups , as is currently done @xcite , it would be productive to fit a single linear model with an overall size change pattern , differences between groups ( e.g. tropical and temperate populations ) represented as orthogonal contrasts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a residual shape change component .",
    "this will allow quantification of the amount of change that can be explained by simple differences such as tropical vs temperate , and the amount of unexplained but ecologically meaningful shape change .",
    "the fact that abundances do not need to be measured in the same units for different species moves the task of studying such global patterns from impossible to merely very difficult .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible to calculate the analogous measures for presence / absence data in cases where abundances can not be reliably estimated .",
    "for example , it would be possible to calculate size and shape change indices from historical records and fossil communities , and hence study global patterns of change over very long time scales .    in the two communities i analyzed",
    ", there was a striking difference in the proportion of change that was size change .",
    "it therefore seems likely that size - based indices such as the living planet index will be much more informative about some communities than others .",
    "i hypothesized that phylogenetically - restricted assemblages might show mainly size change , while diverse assemblages might show mainly shape change .",
    "for example , hydrothermal vent communities occur are characterized by evolutionary radiations of a fairly small group of taxa @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that such communities might show a relatively high proportion of size change .",
    "in contrast , one might expect tropical forests and coral reefs , with high phylogenetic diversity , to show a high proportion of shape change .    in conclusion ,",
    "shape change is distinct from but complementary to the property measured by indices such as the living planet index .",
    "the rate of shape change should be measured in a way that is consistent with population dynamics .",
    "the measures i have derived satisfy this requirement . the key to understanding their properties is the geometry of growth space , whose axes are the proportional growth rates of each species involved .",
