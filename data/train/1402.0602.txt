    "quantum theory poses bounds on the amount of classical information that can be extracted from an ensemble of quantum states or by a quantum measurement , and the problem of quantifying such bounds lies at the heart of many important aspects of the theory . from a fundamental viewpoint , it has implications in fields such as quantum measurement theory  @xcite , entropic uncertainty relations  @xcite , or the informational axiomatization of quantum theory  @xcite . on the other hand , in applications",
    "it is often important to implement preparations and measurements that achieve those bounds in order to optimally perform tasks such as information locking  @xcite , private quantum decoupling  @xcite , purification of noisy quantum measurements  @xcite , randomness generation  @xcite , classical communication over quantum channels  @xcite , storage and retrieval of information from quantum memories  @xcite , and quantum error correction  @xcite .",
    "the problem of quantifying how much information can be extracted from an ensemble of quantum states was first addressed almost half a century ago , and is usually referred to as the accessible information problem  @xcite . since exact solutions to this problem are known only for some restricted classes of symmetric preparations , tight upper and lower bounds - known as the holevo - yuen - ozawa bound  @xcite and the subentropy bound  @xcite , respectively - can often be extremely useful .",
    "we note however that , even for highly symmetric preparations like the so - called _ tetrahedral preparation _ first introduced by davies  @xcite , the analytic evaluation of the accessible information remained an open problem for long time  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a `` dual '' problem to that of accessible information has been introduced , as the problem of quantifying how much information can be extracted by a quantum measurement ( i.e. its _ informational power _ )  @xcite . despite the usefulness of such dual approach  @xcite ( leading e.g. to the analytic evaluation  @xcite of the accessible information of the tetrahedral preparation ) , tight upper and lower bounds on the informational power of a quantum measurement are still lacking .",
    "the tetrahedral configuration for qubits is generalized to higher dimensions by what are called _ symmetric informationally complete _ ( sic ) preparations and measurements  @xcite .",
    "sic quantum measurements  @xcite were introduced as useful tools for quantum tomography , quantum cryptography  @xcite , and classical signal processing  @xcite , but it has been argued that they also play a fundamental role in characterizing the structure of quantum state space  @xcite . despite numerous efforts , many important properties of sic measurements , not last their existence in any dimension , are still unanswered problems .",
    "therefore , any approach that can shed new light on sic measurements may lead to a better understanding of their structure .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we provide tight upper and lower bounds , depending only on the dimension of the system , on the accessible information and the informational power of any preparation and measurement .",
    "while both upper and lower bounds for accessible information can be trivially saturated , we find that , for the case of informational power , the lower bound is saturated by a non - trivial measurement that we name `` scrooge '' following ref .",
    "second , we focus on the case of sic preparations and measurements , providing stronger upper and lower bounds on accessible information and informational power , and proving their tightness in the case of qubits and qutrits . as a corollary of our upper bound ,",
    "we show that the accessible information and the informational power of sic preparations and measurements are always upper bounded by one bit . in this sense , therefore , the statistics generated by sic preparations or sic measurements , though optimal for tomographic purposes , are ( perhaps surprisingly ) constituted by almost completely random bits . as a corollary of our lower bound",
