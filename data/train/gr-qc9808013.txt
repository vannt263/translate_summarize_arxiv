    "over the last several decades , a great deal of interest has been paid on the ( cumulative ) gravitational lensing effect on distant sources due to inhomogeneites in the matter distribution of the universe .",
    "this problem has been studied using various methods @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the lens objects can be treated as point particles .",
    "the point particles may be galaxies for cosmological lenses , or stars for microlensing events . while surveying these papers , one question arises to us out of purely theoretical interst : what happens when we bring the number of particles @xmath0 very large , while fixing the mass density ? does it look like a friedman ",
    "lematre(fl ) universe , or a completely different universe ?    in this article , we discuss what the universe looks like when we take the large @xmath0 limit of a universe filled with point particles by studying the distance - redshift relation .",
    "we distribute point particles of the same mass @xmath1 uniformly throughout the universe with a mean separation @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that on large scales , the spacetime is described by an isotropic homogeneous metric ( robertson  walker metric ) .",
    "the energy density parameter @xmath3 is of order of @xmath4 .",
    "condier a photon beam which is emitted from a distant source which we also treat as a point source .",
    "we observe the redshift and the luminosity of this source . during the propagation",
    ", the luminosity of the photon beam may be amplified by the gravinational lensing effect .",
    "we can consider two types of lensing effect :    * strong lensing effect ; when the beam passes very near to a point particle , it suffers a strong apmlification .",
    "* cumulative weak lensing effect ; the beam does not pass very near to any particle , but travels through the `` ripples '' of gravitational potential , and suffers a weak amplification many times .",
    "the cumulative amplification of the weak lensing effect is estimated as follws@xcite .",
    "the expansion , @xmath5 , of the null geodesic satisfies @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the affine parameter and @xmath8 is the shear ; @xmath9 .",
    "we neglected the vorticity .",
    "since we assume that the beam does not pass very near the particles , the evolution of the shear @xmath8 is estimated as @xmath10 thus , the change in @xmath8 during passing by one particle is approximately given by @xmath11 then , the `` random walk '' for distance @xmath12 results in @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this leads to @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we assume @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble constant , we obtain @xmath18 < < 1 , \\label{eq : weak1}\\\\ \\theta(l)l & \\sim & { \\cal o}[(l / l ) ] < < 1 .\\label{eq : weak2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the fl case , on the contrary , the shear term vanishes and the ricci focusing term determines the evolution of the expansion ; @xmath19 this leads to @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the cumulative amplification is negligible in the point mass universe when the number of paritcles is large enough .",
    "note that we have assumed that the relation between the affine parameter and the redshift coincides with that of fl model .",
    "the proof that the difference is negligible is given in @xcite .",
    "next , we estimate the probability that the photon beam suffers the strong lensing effect as follows . we adopt the thin lens approximation .",
    "the einstein radius of the lens whose mass is @xmath1 is given by@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the distance from the observer to the source .",
    "kpc when @xmath23 , and @xmath24 times the solar radius when @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the redshift of the lens .",
    "thus , a star is usually smaller , and a galaxy is larger , than its einstein radius . ]",
    "the magnification factor @xmath27 , the ratio of the flux density in the observed image to the flux density in the absence of the lens , is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the impact parameter . , and becomes larger as @xmath29 increases . ] from this expression , we can tell that the source is strongly amplified ( i.e. , @xmath30 becomes of order of 10% ) when the impact parameter is close to the einstein radius ; @xmath31 .",
    "we cam estimate the probability @xmath32 that the source is strongly amplified , by considering the probability of hitting any of @xmath0 discs of radius @xmath33 when a photon beam travels in a tube of area @xmath34 ( see fig.1 ) ; @xmath35 where @xmath12 is the distance to the source , and @xmath3 is the mean mass density of the point mass universe .",
    "since @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath17 is the hubble constant , the probability @xmath32 is much smaller than unity for sources at low redshifts , or in a low density universe , and @xmath38 even at rather high redshifts @xmath39 .    when @xmath40 is smaller than unity , part of the beams @xmath41 will reach us without hitting any disc .",
    "the distance ( which is estimated from the observed flux ) to such sources is obtained by following the evolution of the flux in an empty spacetime .",
    "that is , we can regard the distance to these sources as so - called dyer - roeder distance@xcite .",
    "therefore , when we observe the luminosity and redshift of distant point sources in the point mass universe , we would obtain the following :    * part of sources @xmath41 follow the distance - redshift relation of dyer - roeder distance ; * other sources @xmath40 are strongly amplified .    the fraction , @xmath41 , of the sources which never hit a dics is invariant when we change the value of @xmath0 . also , the statistical nature of the distribution of amplification factor is clearly independent of @xmath0 when @xmath40 is enough smaller than unity .",
    "therefore , we can say    * these natures are independent of the number of particles @xmath0 if the mass density @xmath3 is fixed .",
    "actually , this is the well known fact `` the optical depth of gravitational lens is independent of the mass of the lens . ''",
    "we here point out that the statement is valid even in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "that is , even if the universe is filled not with stars but with much smaller point particles , the distance - redshift relation of point sources satisfies the above features , as long as we can keep our assumptions , such as geoemtrical optics treatment .",
    "the fraction @xmath40 increases for higher redshifts and a high density universe .",
    "then , @xmath40 becomes larger than unity .",
    "the number of beams which never hit a disc becomes very small , and multi - scattered events dominate .",
    "however , we expect that the resulting distribution of luminosity of distant point sources is insensitive to @xmath0 as long as the distribution of point particles is random and the thin lens approximation holds .",
    "this is because we can repeat the same discussion for the probability of suffering a next strong lensing event after hitting one disc .",
    "the above analysis is valid for any matter as long as they are compact enough and interact with photons only through gravity .",
    "the lensing objects need not to be galaxies or stars ; they may be sands or elementary ( but dark ) particles .",
    "moreover , the thin lens approximation we adopted above seems to become better as we decrease the mass of lens , since the ratio of einstein radius @xmath33 to the means separation @xmath2 becomes smaller ; @xmath42 .",
    "clearly , the effect of cumulative weak lensing effect becomes negligible as we can see from equations ( [ eq : weak1 ] ) and ( [ eq : weak2 ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the behaviour of distance - redshift relation of the point mas universe does not agree with that of a fl model even when we take the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "holz and wald @xcite studied the lensing effect when the matter distribution of the universe is not homogeneous but the masses are concentrated into compact objects .",
    "they commented that the probability distributions of lensing effect are indistinguishable between the cases where the masses of lenses are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "their results may support the correctness of the above analysis . related with this",
    ", one can show that , in their formalism , the observed ditance - redshift relation for any point source follows that of a fl model in the case of uniform ( not discrete ) distribution of matter , though they do not give an explicit statement .",
    "we give a rough proof in the appendix .    in sugiura",
    "et al.@xcite , it was shown that the discreteness of matter distribution is harmless when we consider the distance - redshift relation in a spherically symmetric space .",
    "it suggests that , in the point mass universe , if we average the luminosity of the sources of the same redshift over the whole sky and calculate the distace - redshift relation with the averaged luminosity , it should agree with the fl relation . holz and wald @xcite state that the averaged luminosity of the beams agrees with that of a fl model .",
    "these statements justify the result we obtained in @xcite .",
    "we also notice that , we would obtain the fl relation if we take the average of sources over a region larger than the mean separation of the interviening lens objects , i.e. , over the region which includes enough strong lensing events .",
    "that is , when the source is much larger than the intervening lens objects .",
    "we can safely calculate its distance using a fl model . +   + the author would like to thank k.  ioka and t.  hamana for useful comments .",
    "we start from the geodesic deviation equation .",
    "let @xmath45 be the deviation vector , and define matrix @xmath46 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the affine parameter .",
    "then the geodesic deviation equation is written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the tangent vector of the null geodesic . in a robertson - walker spacetime",
    ", this equation takes the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the frequency of the photon and @xmath3 is the energy density of the universe .",
    "then , after traveling for small @xmath53 , @xmath54 consider a ball of radius @xmath22 whose density is uniform , and a bundle of light ray which passes through this ball at a distance @xmath29 from the center of the ball . by direct calculation , they show that @xmath55 where @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total mass of the matter inside the ball . from the relations @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "we can see that equation ( [ dev2 ] ) agrees with ( [ dev1 ] ) .",
