    "the lack of a significant large scale anisotropy in the angular distribution of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) argues in favor of their cosmological origin ( e.g. , meegan _ et al .",

    "_ 1996 ; tegmark _ et al .",
    "assuming they are all standard candles , the observed number of bursts at a given flux relates directly to a number of sources at a given redshift .",
    "the maximum redshift sampled by batse under these assumptions is @xmath9 ( e.g. , cohen & piran 1995 ) .",
    "evolution of the burst population can modify this value .",
    "if bursts would happen to be more active in recent cosmic history , the maximum redshift would be lower .",
    "however , the maximum redshift can not be much lower than @xmath10 1 in any scenario in which the bursts trace the distribution of galaxies .",
    "galaxy clusters are known to be concentrated toward the supergalactic plane ( e.g. , tully 1992 ; kolatt , dekel , @xmath11 lahav 1995 ) .",
    "the brightest ( and thus nearest ) bursts would reflect the mass concentrations of the nearby local universe .",
    "however , no significant deviation from isotropy has been found in the 3b - catalog data corrected for sky exposure ( hartmann , briggs , @xmath11 mannheim 1996 ) .",
    "if grbs are indeed seen to a redshift of @xmath102 , absorption of the high energy gamma - rays by diffuse background radiation must become important at photon energies greater than 30 gev .",
    "since gamma - ray emitting blazars are also subject to pair absorption , and since their redshifts are often accurately known , one can determine the density of the diffuse radiation fields from the infrared to the uv by measuring their gamma - ray cutoff energies ( stecker , de jager , & salamon 1992 ; de jager , stecker , & salamon 1994 ; dwek & slavin 1994 ; mannheim _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; madau & phinney 1996 ) . for blazars ,",
    "detailed spectral models exist which can discriminate between internal and external absorption ( e.g. , blandford & levinson 1995 ; mannheim 1993 ) .",
    "in fact , one could calibrate the distance scale to gamma - ray bursts by measuring their cutoff energies due to external absorption using the background radiation density inferred from blazar observations .",
    "for such a program to be successful , nature must provide burst spectra reaching very high photon energies .",
    "currently , our knowledge about high - energy burst spectra is rather sparse , and it is not known whether they exhibit an intrinsic turnover in the 10gev@xmath1030tev region or not ( hurley 1996 ) . however , burst statistics are consistent with all batse bursts having high - energy tails such as the ones observed by egret ( dingus _ et al .",
    "some of the bright grbs which received exposure by egret were detected at gev energies without evidence for a spectral rollover ( hurley _ et al .",
    "this raises the hope that the _ intrinsic _ spectra continue to still higher energies and that one could in turn use the expected exponential turnover to set a distance scale . in fact , the relativistic cosmological fireball model of mszros & rees ( 1993 ) predicts that the grb spectra have high - energy tails in general ( mszros , rees , & papathanassiou 1994 ) .",
    "nevertheless , numerous array and cerenkov telescope burst searches at high energies have only provided upper limits ; _",
    "e.g. _ kieda _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) ( casa - mia ) , alexandreas _",
    "( 1994 ) ( cygnus ) , aglietta _ et al . _",

    "the purpose of this work is to provide quantitative predictions of the expected burst rate as a function of photon energy accounting for cosmic absorption and to compare the result with experimental limits .",
    "we will start with the computation of the gamma - ray horizon and show templates of absorbed spectra . in a second step ,",
    "we use the gamma - ray horizon to determine the number of bursts at a given detection threshold .",
    "finally , we determine the limiting sensitivity required for a detection at a given threshold gamma - ray energy and compare this with the sensitivity of current experiments .",
    "gamma - rays of energy @xmath12 propagating from a distant source at redshift @xmath13 toward a terrestrial observer can be absorbed by inelastic interactions with low energy photons of present - day energy @xmath14 from an isotropic diffuse background radiation field .",
    "the dominant process is pair creation @xmath15 .",
    "the threshold energy for this process is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the cosine of the scattering angle .",
    "since the soft photon density varies strongly with energy for typical radiation fields , the optical depth @xmath18 must also vary reflecting the number density of target photons at the resonant energy @xmath19 .",
    "the pair creation cross section is given by @xmath20{\\rm cm^2}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and where @xmath23 denotes the thomson cross section .",
    "for the computation of the optical depth we use the geodesic radial displacement function @xmath24^{-1}$ ] where @xmath25 is given by equation ( 13.3 ) in peebles ( 1993 ) . for a cosmological model with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the function @xmath25 simplifies to @xmath28 .",
    "hence , we obtain the optical depth @xmath29 for a nonevolving present - day background density @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 , where the dash indicates comoving frame quantities . at some time in the past",
    ", the background photon density was built up by bursts of massive star formation during the era of galaxy formation . as a result",
    ", the photon density evolution should be more shallow than @xmath32 at this epoch , and the corresponding @xmath33-ray absorption should be somewhat weaker .",
    "we will discuss this effect only qualitatively below .",
    "the shape of the present - day diffuse background density @xmath34 is obtained by averaging over various galaxy formation models presented by macminn & primack ( 1996 ) .",
    "we multiplied this shape by a small factor to obtain agreement with the background density ( including the contribution from the 2.7  k microwave background ) estimated by beichman & helou ( 1992 ) in the far - infrared ( fir ) ( for a modest galaxy luminosity or density evolution @xmath35 ) , and by madau & phinney ( 1996 ) in the near - infrared ( nir ) through uv range ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the predicted background densities depend sensitively on which density or luminosity evolution and maximum redshift are assumed and can vary by an order of magnitude .",
    "hence , it is very important to tighten existing constraints on the actual background density ( biller _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) by obtaining better galaxy luminosity functions from deep galaxy surveys or by direct measurements of blazar gamma - ray ( external ! ) turnover detections .",
    "we integrate numerically the optical depth function and solve for the gamma - ray horizon @xmath36 .",
    "results are shown in fig.2 for two values of the hubble constant .",
    "templates of absorbed infinite power law spectra are shown in fig.3 for various redshifts .",
    "note that the adopted diffuse radiation background does not have a strong dust component which would be responsible for tev absorption of mrk421 , as suggested by de jager , stecker , & salamon ( 1994 ) .",
    "theoretical modeling of the broadband continuum spectrum of mrk421 over 18 orders of magnitude in frequency predicts a cutoff due to _ internal _ gamma - ray absorption for mrk421 ( mannheim _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) which could explain the lack of gamma - rays above tev observed by whipple .",
    "this is in contrast to the assumption by de jager _",
    "( 1994 ) of a straight power law for the intrinsic spectrum extending well beyond tev .",
    "further observations will show whether the cutoff is variable with flux as expected from the intrinsic model or whether it is fixed as expected from absorption by an anomalously high external dust component .",
    "in our straw person s model , the bursts represent standard candles out to a redshift of @xmath37 ( cohen & piran 1995 ) . assuming no source evolution and a galaxy density of @xmath38  mpc@xmath39 ( @xmath40  km  s@xmath41  mpc@xmath41 ) , the observed batse brightness distribution can be matched if @xmath42 bursts ( each of energy @xmath43ergs ) occur per year per galaxy . the number of bursts above a gamma - ray energy @xmath44 is then given by the number of bursts in the cosmic volume enclosed by the gamma - ray horizon at that energy , i.e. the hyperplane @xmath45 .",
    "the absorbed energy from bursts beyond the horizon is re - emitted in other wave bands depending on the intergalactic magnetic field ( aharonian , coppi , & vlk 1994 ) , possibly with time delays indicative of intergalactic magnetic fields ( plaga 1995 ) . for burst spectra as steep as those observed with egret in the gev range ( hurley _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , the `` pileup '' of absorbed energy below @xmath44 is negligible .",
    "the number of bursts per year at a given threshold energy @xmath44 and for a volume burst rate @xmath46 is then given by @xmath47 [ see equation ( 13.61 ) of peebles ( 1993 ) , with an extra factor ( 1+z ) accounting for the redshift of the burst rate ] . the integral simplifies considerably for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "in this case , the angular size distance @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 yielding @xmath51.\\ ] ] for the volume burst rate @xmath52",
    "mpc@xmath39  yr@xmath41 and a batse trigger efficiency of @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath54  yr@xmath41 integrating to @xmath55 .",
    "the dependence on the hubble constant enters equation ( [ ne ] ) only through the value of @xmath56 and is therefore rather weak .",
    "nevertheless , it is an interesting possibility to determine the hubble constant by number counts of grbs .    in fig.4",
    "we show the number of bursts versus detection threshold demonstrating the rapid shrinking of the observable universe with increasing @xmath44 due to pair absorption . at energies of @xmath1010  tev ,",
    "the standard candle scenario predicts @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) bursts per year .",
    "the number of bursts which can be _ detected _ above a given energy threshold depends also on the particular instrumental sensitivity @xmath59 , the spectral shape and the duration of the bursts .",
    "suppose we want to measure _ all _ grbs above an energy @xmath44 ( within redshifts @xmath60 ) , then what is the necessary flux sensitivity of our detector to achieve this goal ? in the straw person s model , this problem is easy to solve . for a given threshold @xmath44 the observed flux obeys the relation @xmath61\\over 4\\pi ( c / h_\\circ)^2 y(z_\\circ)^2(1+z_\\circ)^2}\\ , , \\ ] ] again referring to peeble s ( 1993 ) notation .",
    "the standard candle luminosity normalized for a batse burst duration @xmath62 is given by @xmath63=7\\times 10^{50}h^{-2}\\left(\\delta t\\over 1\\ { \\rm s}\\right)^{-1 } \\left(e_\\circ\\over e_{\\rm b}\\right)^{2-\\alpha}{(1+z_\\circ)^{2-\\alpha}}\\ , , \\ ] ] adopting a high - energy power law spectrum with photon index @xmath64 above an intrinsic break energy @xmath65  mev . with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath66 for the source flux at the distance of the gamma ray horizon .",
    "all other sources will be within the horizon , thus closer , and thus brighter .",
    "although the burst luminosity in the standard - candle picture is fixed ( @xmath67  s ) , we leave the possibility open that the high - energy tails persist longer than the typical batse bursts .",
    "( 1994 ) indicate spectral slopes @xmath68 and extended or delayed durations of 30s @xmath10 90 minutes for egret detected bursts .",
    "in fig.5 we plot the limiting sensitivity for @xmath69 and @xmath70 and for high - energy tail durations extended relative to the batse bursts by factors 1 and 100 . for comparison ,",
    "we show current experimental limits in the same plot demonstrating that they can in principle detect all bursts .",
    "the apparently paradoxical increase of the limiting flux with energy reflects the rapid shrinking of the gamma - ray horizon : the higher the energy , the closer , and thus the brighter , the bursts from the gamma - ray horizon are .",
    "more pessimistically , if the intrinsic spectra were steeper than the egret bursts , the sensitivity of current experiments is insufficient to detect all of them . in view of the very small _ total _ burst rates at high energies ( see fig.4 ) ,",
    "this would practically comply with zero expected event rates .",
    "we estimated the expected gamma - ray burst rate as a function of threshold energy .",
    "the straw person s scenario considers standard candles at cosmological distances emitting an intrinsically unabsorbed high - energy power law spectrum . with these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "we predict a maximum of @xmath71 bursts per year in the tev range , roughly an order of magnitude less above 10  tev , and practically none at @xmath72  tev .",
    "the perhaps more realistic case of a steep power law luminosity distribution of the bursts does not significantly affect the maximum redshift @xmath73 of their cosmological distribution ( cohen & piran 1995 ) , and therefore it does not change the expected burst rates .",
    "an enhancement of the burst rate in the @xmath74  gev range by factors of @xmath75 is possible if evolution of the background density is important at redshifts @xmath76 .",
    "the sensitivities of current experiments are sufficient to detect bursts if their spectra are not steeper than @xmath77 .",
    "taking into account sky exposure and triggering efficiency ( see tab .",
    "1 ) , we rule out the possibility of cosmological burst detection by cygnus , eas - top and casa - mia ( and similar experiments with thresholds at @xmath78  tev ) . due to its low threshold , milagro or future low - threshold air @xmath79erenkov telescopes could at most detect @xmath3 events per year .",
    "the whipple observatory , the tibet air shower array , and hegra have very low expected detection rates ( @xmath80 events per year ) .",
    ".gamma - ray burst rates predicted for various experiments ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath81 ) .",
    "note that a hubble constant @xmath82 would increase all rates by a factor @xmath75 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     if the burst delays at high energies are shorter than the telescope slewing time , the expected burst rate for air @xmath79erenkov telescopes would be down by @xmath5 owing to their small field of view .",
    "the major uncertainties of the theoretical expectation values lie in the cosmic ir - to - uv photon density ( @xmath3 in the fir ) , the hubble constant ( factor @xmath83 ) and the effect of forward cascading in the intergalactic medium which counteracts the pair absorption depending on the intergalactic magnetic field strength ( protheroe & stanev 1993 ; aharonian , coppi , & vlk 1994 ; plaga 1995 ) . a low background density , a large hubble constant and weak intergalactic magnetic fields would act to increase the high - energy burst detection rate . on the other hand , the high infrared background inferred by de jager , stecker & salamon ( 1994 ) and by dwek & slavin ( 1994 ) assuming tev absorption of mrk421 would further reduce the number of bursts above @xmath76  tev by a factor of @xmath3 . in any cosmological scenario ,",
    "pair absorption by diffuse background radiation leads to a rapidly decreasing number of bursts above @xmath3  gev .",
    "by contrast , bursts originating in a galactic halo would not be affected by absorption which occurs only on cosmic scales .",
    "halo bursts should therefore be much more numerous than cosmological bursts at high energies , as has been pointed out by alexandreas _",
    "( 1994 ) and hurley ( 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , if one clings to the assumption of infinite power law tails , the nondetection of grbs by current experiments is in agreement with the straw person s scenario of a cosmological origin of bursts , but it would require intrinsic spectral cutoffs below @xmath84  gev in halo models . on the other hand , just a few burst detections above @xmath1050  tev would render cosmological models highly unlikely . if intrinsic cutoffs would be important , it is interesting to note that the predictions for halo and cosmological burst models are again quite different . in halo models ,",
    "the brighter bursts should have cutoffs at lower energies due to their higher compactness , whereas cosmological models predict the opposite , since the bright sources would be near sources with less external absorption .",
