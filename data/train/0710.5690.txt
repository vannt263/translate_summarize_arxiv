    "determination of the expansion history of the universe , from which we can constrain the physical nature of its matter and energy constituents , is the central problem of traditional cosmology .",
    "one way it can be addressed is through the use of a set of coordinate distances and redshifts for some standard set of objects .",
    "type ia supernovae provide a modified standard candle ( e.g. @xcite ) that allow the distance modulus , luminosity distance , and coordinate distance to each source to be determined .    in a novel ,",
    "model - independent approach to this problem , it was shown by @xcite that the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance with respect to redshift could be obtained from the coordinate distances and combined to solve for the expansion rate @xmath3 and acceleration rate @xmath1 of the universe .",
    "the only assumptions are that the universe is described by a robertson - walker metric and has zero space curvature .",
    "the results are independent of the contents of the universe and the properties of these contents , and independent of whether general relativity provides an accurate description of the universe .",
    "the assumption of zero space curvature is dropped by @xcite , who show that the deceleration parameter at a redshift of zero , @xmath4 , remains the same , independent of whether space curvature is zero or non - zero .",
    "[ yeq ]    .,title=\"fig : \" ] [ pfw ]     [ kv ]    to study the properties of the dark energy as a function of redshift , the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance can be combined to solve for the pressure , energy density , equation of state , and kinetic and potential energy densities of the dark energy if a theory of gravity be specified , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "einstein s equations from general relativity for an isotropic and homogeneous universe are used to define the relationship between the dark energy pressure and energy density , the mass - energy density of non - relativistic matter , and the expansion and acceleration rates of the universe .",
    "given that the expansion and acceleration rates of the universe are known independent of the contents of the universe , these equations allow a determination of the pressure , energy density , and equation of state of the dark energy as functions of redshift , as shown by @xcite , and the kinetic and potential energy density of the dark energy .",
    "our model - independent method has been applied to the 182 sn presented by @xcite .",
    "the values of the coordinate distance to each source are obtained from the distance moduli , as described by @xcite .    as shown in figure [ yeq ] , the current value of the acceleration parameter is @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that the universe is accelerating today with greater than @xmath5 confidence .",
    "note that our determination of @xmath4 depends only upon the assumption that the universe is described by a robertson - walker metric , and _ is independent of the value of space curvature _ , as discussed in detail by @xcite , and as is clear from the equations presented by @xcite .",
    "the redshift of transition from a state of acceleration to a state of deceleration does require that a value of space curvature be specified , so two assumption are made to determine @xmath6 : zero space curvature and a robertson - walker line element .",
    "for the sample of @xcite , we find @xmath2 .    the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance with respect to redshift are combined to solve for the pressure , energy density , and equation of state of the dark energy as functions of redshift by applying the equations derived by @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ pfw ] .",
    "the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance can also be combined to obtain the kinetic and potential energy density of a dark energy scalar field , and these results are shown in figure [ kv ] .",
    "overall , the results are consistent with those expected in a standard lambda cold dark matter model , in which a cosmological constant is responsible for the acceleration history of the universe , at about the two sigma level .",
    "further details of this study are presented by @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the observers for their tireless efforts to obtain the supernovae data that makes these studies possible .",
