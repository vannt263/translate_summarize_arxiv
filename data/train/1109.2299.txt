    "most young stars are surrounded by circumstellar disks , the natural by - product of star formation .",
    "after a protostar has formed , its disk plays a crucial role in the evolution of the system , first by serving as reservoir for mass accretion , and later by becoming the birthplace of the planetary system . at early evolutionary stage the mass of the _ primordial disk _ is dominated by gas , with a few percent of mass in small dust grains .",
    "the gaseous component plays an important role in controlling the dust dynamics in the disk @xcite , and its dispersal determines the time available to form jupiter- and saturn - like giant planets . as the disk evolves ,",
    "the gas content is removed by viscous accretion @xcite and/or by photoevaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "current observational results imply that the primordial gas becomes largely depleted in the first 10myr @xcite .",
    "a gas - poor disk appears , where the lifetime of individual dust grains under the influence of radiative forces  without the stabilization effect of the surrounding gas  is far less than the stellar age .",
    "the dust grains are believed to be continuously replenished by collisions and/or evaporation of previously formed planetesimals ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in these _ debris disks _ only a small amount of gas is expected .",
    "similarly to the dust , this gas could be _ second generation _",
    ", produced by sublimation of planetesimals , photodesorption from dust grains @xcite , or vaporization of colliding dust particles @xcite .",
    "so far only a few debris disks are known with detectable gas component .",
    "the edge - on orientation of the disk around @xmath3pic allowed the detection of a very small amount of circumstellar gas ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) through the presence of absorption / emission lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite successfully exploited the favorable edge - on geometry of the disk around to detect gas via .",
    "in contrast to the disks mentioned above , the debris disk around the young main - sequence star seems to have substantial ( @xmath613@xmath7 ) molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the origin of the gas in the above mentioned systems is currently under debate",
    ". it can be residual primordial gas that survived longer in the outer disks than usually assumed @xcite or it may have formed or been released recently . based on dynamical arguments",
    ", @xcite suggested that the gas in @xmath3pic is secondary . analyzing high - resolution data obtained with the sma interferometer at 230ghz , @xcite proposed that is in a late stage of its evolution , possibly representing the link between gas - rich primordial disks and gas - poor optically thin debris disks .",
    "@xcite suggested an age of 20myr for , while @xcite derived @xmath68myr as the age of the star . in the case of the older age , would challenge the current picture of gas disk evolution , while the lower value could still be marginally consistent with a primordial disk phase .",
    "the confirmation of the existence of debris disks containing a significant amount of gas would require to find and study more -like systems with reliable age estimates .",
    "it might well be possible that a number of similar systems exists , since most debris disks that are similar to in terms of age and fractional luminosity have never been observed in molecular lines ( most such candidates are in the southern hemisphere ) .",
    "motivated by this fact , we carried out a survey with the apex radio telescope to detect molecular gas in 20 infrared - luminous debris disks . here",
    "we review the results of this survey and report on the discovery of a second -like disk around the 30myr - old star .",
    "for candidate selection we adopted the system as a template . this a1-type star harbors a dusty disk that re - emits a fraction @xmath8 of the star s radiation at infrared wavelengths .",
    "this fractional luminosity is an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding value in primordial disks .",
    "we used the following target selection criteria : ( 1 ) spectral type between a0 and f6 ; ( 2 ) @xmath9 in the range of @xmath10 that excludes both primordial disks and very tenuous debris disks ; ( 3 ) the excess emission is confirmed by an instrument independent of _ iras _ ( 4 ) ages between 10 and 100myr , the age estimate is based on kinematic group membership or other reliable dating methods . in total , 20 candidates were selected from the lists of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their basic properties are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "for most sources , disk parameters ( temperature , radius , and fractional luminosity ) were adopted from the literature ( table  [ table1 ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "disk radii were estimated by adopting blackbody - like dust emission .",
    "for no previous literature data were found , thus we collected infrared photometry from the _ iras _ fsc , _ akari _ irc , _ akari _ fis and _ wise _ @xcite . for",

    "disk parameters for these two targets were derived following @xcite . for sources where submillimeter observations were available , we computed dust masses assuming optically thin emission with @xmath12@xmath13g@xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite , and dust temperature from table  [ table1 ] . for comparison of the fundamental parameters ,",

    "our survey was carried out with the apex 12 m telescope @xcite in service mode , between 2008 october and 2009 november .",

    "the weather conditions were generally dry , the precipitable water vapor was below 1.3 mm for most of the @xmath0=3@xmath12 observations and ranged between 1.3 and 2.7 mm during the @xmath0=2@xmath11 measurements .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the gildas / class package . for the final average spectrum",

    "both lines display double peaked line profile with identical peak positions .",
    "the central velocities of both lines are consistent with the systemic velocity of the star ( + 17.3@xmath110.8kms@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we integrated the intensities / fluxes over an interval of 8kms@xmath14 that covers the whole line profile .",
    "the beam efficiencies and kelvin - to - jansky conversion factors were taken from the apex web page .",
    "for the non - detected sources , upper limits were estimated as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the measured noise , @xmath21 is the velocity channel width , and @xmath22 is the number of velocity channels over an interval of 10kms@xmath14 . the total mass ( or upper limit ) of co molecules ( @xmath23 ) was estimated assuming optically thin emission and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "the excitation temperature ( @xmath24 ) was assumed to be equal to the dust temperature in table  [ table1 ] ( i.e. , gas and dust are sufficiently coupled ) .",
    "the obtained line intensities / fluxes as well as the estimated co masses are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "note that for the co masses computed independently from the ( 2@xmath11 ) and ( 3@xmath12 ) transitions are significantly different .",
    "figure  [ fig3](left panel ) shows the integrated co(3@xmath12 ) fluxes and upper limits , normalized to 100pc , plotted against the fractional luminosities of the disks . for comparison , additional protoplanetary / debris disks around",
    "a0-f6-type pre - main / main - sequence stars , including , are also displayed @xcite .",
    "our observations fill the gap between herbig ae / be disks and older debris disks .",
    "note that the fractional luminosities of and are modest even within the debris sample , and significantly lower than those of the primordial disks .",
    "thus , @xmath9 does not appear to be a good proxy for the presence of co gas in debris disks .",
    "figure  [ fig3](right panel ) presents the integrated co(3@xmath12 ) fluxes versus the ( blackbody ) radii of the dust disks .",
    "interestingly , the two definite detections , and , harbor the most extended disks , suggesting that large radius and low dust temperature may be essential for co detection .",
    "although the radii in this analysis rely on the assumption of blackbody grains , the conclusion holds in the case of realistic grain size distributions . using the blackbody assumption , we may systematically underestimate the true radius , due to the presence of inefficiently emitting small particles .",
    "however , assuming similar grains in all disks , the relative distribution of disk radii would not differ from the blackbody case ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "is an a3-type star at a distance of 72pc @xcite , a member of the @xmath630myr old columba group @xcite .",
    "fitting an atlas9 atmosphere model @xcite to the optical and near - ir ( _ hipparcos , tycho-2 , two micron all sky survey _ ) data , assuming solar metallicity and @xmath25 yields @xmath26 = 8300k .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of @xcite imply a stellar mass of 1.85@xmath27 .",
    "we modeled the measured line profiles of with a simple disk geometry assuming a combination of a radial power - law and a vertical gaussian profile for the density distribution : @xmath28 we fixed the following parameters : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31au ( table  [ table1 ] ) , and @xmath32au ( typical for herbig ae / be disks ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we assumed an h@xmath33 abundance relative to co of 10@xmath34 , and that gas and dust grains  the latter act like blackbody  are well mixed , prescribing that the gas kinetic temperature and dust temperature distributions are identical .",
    "the velocity of the material in the disk was derived by assuming keplerian orbits around a star of 1.85@xmath35 mass .",
    "then the co level populations at each disk position , and the resulting emission line profiles were calculated using the non - lte spectral line radiation transfer code lime @xcite .",
    "first , we fitted the ( 32 ) line by adjusting @xmath36 and the disk inclination .",
    "the best - fitting model spectrum with @xmath37@xmath38 and @xmath39 is overplotted with dashed line in figure  [ fig2 ] . with the same parameters we also computed a co ( 21 ) profile . as figure",
    "[ fig2 ] shows , this model significantly underestimates the observed co(21 ) feature .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the same as what causes the difference in the co mass estimates from ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) lines : the ratio of integrated co(3@xmath12 ) flux to the integrated co(2@xmath11 ) flux is only 1.43@xmath110.37 , significantly lower than the ratio of 3.8 , expected for @xmath40k in lte condition .",
    "this low line flux ratio corresponds to an excitation temperature of 13.1@xmath112.7k .",
    "this is unrealistically low ( subthermal ) for being an lte value , suggesting that the density of collision partners ( h@xmath33 ) is lower than the critical density , and the excitation is not collisionally dominated . in order to provide a model that can fit both lines simultaneously , we gradually decreased the h@xmath33/co abundance ratio and repeated the above - mentioned modeling process .",
    "we found that with h@xmath33/co=1000@xmath11500 , @xmath41@xmath38 , and @xmath42 , both line profiles can be fitted ( solid line in figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "note that in this non - lte model the kinetic and excitation temperatures of the gas are different .",
    "the total co mass predicted by this model is @xmath43@xmath7 .",
    "its reliable age determination makes the oldest example for a gas - bearing debris disk . in many aspects",
    "it resembles the somewhat younger .",
    "both systems contain an a - type central star that produces energetic uv that could dissociate co molecules in the vicinity of the star . and clearly stand out from our sample in terms of disk radius , and of harboring a large amount of relatively cold dust ( @xmath44k and @xmath45@xmath7 ) .",
    "note also that these two systems exhibit very similar @xmath23/@xmath46 ratios ( @xmath60.003 ) .",
    "based on their similarities , we speculate that and may be the first representatives of a so far undefined new class of relatively old ( @xmath28myr ) , gaseous dust disks .",
    "@xcite claim that the disk around contains predominantly primordial gas and may represent the link between gas - rich primordial disks and gas - poor debris disks .",
    "it is a question whether system may be of similar origin .",
    "the gas clearing process in primordial disks is expected to progress outwards due to photoevaporation driven by the central star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus the last reservoir of gas will be the outermost part of the circumstellar disk . indeed , and possess the largest disks and consequently have the longest expected survival time for gas in our sample ( though the evaporation timescale also depends on the high energy flux of the central star ) . a confirmed primordial origin of the gas in the system ,",
    "would pose a serious question to the current paradigm since its age of @xmath630myr significantly exceeds both the model predictions for disk clearing and the ages of the oldest ttauri - like or transitional gas disks in the literature @xcite .",
    "primordial co gas can survive only in the case of efficient shielding from the stellar / interstellar high - energy photons .",
    "we determined the stellar uv flux from the fitted atlas9 atmosphere model ( see section  [ analysis ] ) and the uv component of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) from @xcite .",
    "for each disk position , where the h@xmath33 and co column densities are provided by our model , we analyzed the shielding efficiency using the photodissociation model of @xcite for different @xmath47 and @xmath48 pairs ( shielding by dust grains is negligible in this tenuous disk ) .",
    "we found that no region in the disk is shielded enough to provide a co lifetime longer than 500yr .",
    "adopting a lower scale height would lead to higher radial column densities but would not affect significantly the vertical column densities , thus the uv photons of the isrf  which dominate the stellar uv flux almost everywhere in the disk  could efficiently photodissociate co molecules . in the course of modeling we assumed that the gas and dust are sufficiently coupled leading to a common temperature , but in tenuous debris disks this may not be true @xcite . assuming a lower gas temperature similar to the measured excitation temperature would allow the existence of a larger amount of hydrogen gas .",
    "however , the gas is not likely to cool down to such a low temperature all over the disk .",
    "thus based on this result , as well as on the obtained h@xmath33/co ratio of @xmath61000 that is lower than expected for a primordial composition , the scenario of primordial origin of gas in is unlikely .",
    "is it possible then , that the gas in this disk is of secondary origin , being continuously replenished from icy planetesimals ? in this scenario the gas may have a very low h@xmath33/co ratio . without",
    "the presence of a large amount of h@xmath33 , shielding against uv photons is weak .",
    "our modeling predicts co photodissociation timescales of less than 500 years in the whole disk . in order to reproduce the observed co mass of @xmath63.5@xmath49@xmath50",
    ", co has to be released from solids with a rate of @xmath177@xmath51@xmath50yr@xmath14 .",
    "pure co ice evaporates at temperatures above 18k , thus it is volatile even far from the luminous central star , meaning that the surface of planetesimals is very likely already depleted in co ice .",
    "however , co ice can persist in deeper layers and/or can be trapped in mixed h@xmath33o  co ices even on the surface at temperatures below @xmath6140k .",
    "destructive collisions between planetesimals can lead to the release of subsurface ices .",
    "in addition , frequent collisions of icy grains with smaller particles  mainly with @xmath3 meteoroids  could produce a continuous flux of co via vaporization .",
    "photodesorption from solids can also significantly contribute to the gas production .",
    "extrapolation of the current production rate for the last 20myr ( assuming a primordial gas - rich disk phase in the first 10myr and a steady - state disk evolution afterwards ) would yield a total of @xmath1714@xmath50 of co released from planetesimals / grains . adopting a co mass abundance of 10% in the planetesimals ( see the composition of the comet hale - bopp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this scenario would require the complete destruction of more than 140@xmath50 mass of planetesimals in the outer disk .",
    "it would significantly exceed the full initial dust content of a typical protoplanetary disk , making this steady - state scenario questionable .",
    "a more satisfactory explanation would be that the system is currently undergoing a phase of temporarily high co production .",
    "the origin of this contemporeous gas production might be imprinted in the spatial distribution of the gas and dust , and could be revealed with future interferometers .",
    "our results indicate that neither primordial origin nor steady secondary production can unequivocally explain the presence of co gas in the disk of",
    ". an on - going temporarily high co production may be more likely .",
    "detection of other gas components and transitions with _ herschel _ and _ alma _ , as well as the better characterization of the disk structure may lead to the deeper understanding of this enigmatic system and clarify whether and are the first examples of a so far less studied phase of disk evolution .",

    "<S> gas - rich primordial disks and tenuous gas - poor debris disks are usually considered as two distinct evolutionary phases of the circumstellar matter . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the debris disk around the young main - sequence star 49 ceti possesses a substantial amount of molecular gas , and possibly represents the missing link between the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> motivated to understand the evolution of the gas component in circumstellar disks via finding more 49 ceti - like systems , we carried out a co @xmath0=3@xmath12 survey with atacama pathfinder experiment , targeting 20 infrared - luminous debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> these systems fill the gap between primordial and old tenuous debris disks in terms of fractional luminosity . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the discovery of a second 49 ceti - like disk around the 30 myr old a3-type star hd21997 , a member of the columba association . </S>",
    "<S> this system was also detected in the co(2@xmath11 ) transition , and the reliable age determination makes it an even clearer example of an old gas - bearing disk than 49 ceti . </S>",
    "<S> while the fractional luminosities of hd21997 and 49 ceti are not particularly high , these objects seem to harbor the most extended disks within our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the double - peaked profiles of hd21997 were reproduced by a keplerian disk model combined with the lime radiative transfer code . based on their similarities , 49 ceti and hd21997 </S>",
    "<S> may be the first representatives of a so far undefined new class of relatively old ( @xmath28myr ) , gaseous dust disks . from our results , neither primordial origin nor steady secondary production from icy planetesimals can unequivocally explain the presence of co gas in the disk of hd21997 . </S>"
