    "what are the initial conditions that give rise to star formation ? understanding the physical and chemical structure of the cores at the pre - collapse stage (  pre - protostellar cores \" ) is critical for examining models for the core evolution and star formation .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed for pre - protostellar cores ; recently one of these , the bonnor - ebert sphere , has been the subject of increased interest .",
    "a pre - protostellar core may be described as a hydrostatic isothermal pressure - confined , non - rotating , non - magnetized , self - gravitating sphere  a bonnor - ebert sphere ( bonnor 1956 ; ebert 1955 ) .",
    "if the center to edge density contrast of a bonnor - ebert sphere exceeds a critical value , this core is unstable and subject to collapse with small perturbation .",
    "the extreme case of such collapsing cores is a singular isothermal sphere with density @xmath4 , which will collapse in a free - fall time scale ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "recent extinction study by alves , lada , & lada ( 2001 ; hereafter all2001 ) suggested that the density profile of b68 is remarkably consistent with a bonnor - ebert sphere with 2.1 @xmath0 at 16 k. as turbulence exists prevalently in giant molecular clouds , a bonnor - ebert sphere must be formed after turbulence has decayed ; however , it is not well understood how this transition occurs and how long it takes for the decay of turbulence .",
    "it is , therefore , important to determine observationally the degree of turbulence present in b68 .",
    "furthermore , the presence of magnetic fields in some pre - protostellar cores have been detected through dust polarization ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "if magnetic fields couple to the gas dynamics through the ionized gas component ( ambipolar diffusion ) , magnetic fields could slow down the dynamical collapse of the cores ( ciolek & mouschovias 1993 ) .",
    "these models predict a different physical structure for the density , temperature , magnetic fields , and turbulence , which will determine the dynamics and evolutionary history of the core .",
    "both turbulence and magnetic fields can provide additional support against gravity .",
    "thus , for a given / observed center - to - edge density contrast , the presence of any turbulence and magnetic field can modify the size and hence the mass , for an equivalent bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "the density structure of pre - protostellar cores is obtained through three major approaches : ( sub-)millimeter and infrared dust emission ( e.g. shirley et al .",
    "2000 ; willacy & langer 2000 ) , dust extinction from optical and infrared wavelengths ( e.g. all2001 ) , and molecular gas emission with tracers that do not readily deplete at high density such as 3 and 2h+ ( e.g. kuiper et al .",
    "1996 ; tafalla et al .",
    "however there are limitations to each of these probes of the core status .",
    "the dust is optically thin at submillimeter and far infrared wavelengths and thus can be well mapped .",
    "however , the interpretation of the dust emission is sensitive to both temperature and density .",
    "the dust extinction obtained with optical and infrared has very high spatial resolution ; however , it requires background stars along each line of sight across the core and the derivation of density relies on the assumed gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "nevertheless when a grid of a large number of stars are observed , as demonstrated by all2001 for b68 , it can provide a robust estimate of the core size and the relative density profile across the core .",
    "the molecular spectral line observations are important probes of core dynamics , which can not be obtained with dust observations .",
    "however they too have limitations as density and dynamical probes because of depletion .",
    "chemical models suggest that most molecules may deplete in the center of the cores as molecules accrete onto dust grains ( rawlings et al .",
    "1992 ; bergin & langer 1997 ) , making h@xmath5 column density and mass determinations subject to the assumed depletion factor . nh@xmath6 and n@xmath5h@xmath7 are among the very few molecules whose abundances remain high even when others , e.g. , co , ccs and cs , are heavily depleted .",
    "submillimeter and millimeter continuum maps of pre - protostellar cores have shown that the typical intensity profile of pre - protostellar cores is flat at the inner region and steepens toward the edge ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ; ward - thompson , motte , & andre 1999 , willacy & langer 2000 ) .",
    "if the temperature gradient in the cores is negligible , the intensity profile can be treated as a column density profile .",
    "such profiles are consistent with the predicted signature of bonnor - ebert spheres ( ward - thompson 2002 ) , but they are also qualitatively consistent with the ambipolar diffusion model ( ciolek & basu 2000 ) .",
    "b68 is an isolated quiescent bok globule near the ophiucus complex .",
    "its nearly spherical geometry makes it a good candidate for comparison between observations and theoretical models ( which are primarily spherically symmetric ) .",
    "the importance of b68 is that it may be a core on the verge of collapse . all2001",
    "derive the radial extinction profile of b68 from the optical and near infrared photometry of background stars , and the profile is remarkably consistent with a 16 k isothermal bonnor - ebert sphere with a mass of 2.1 m@xmath8 ( assuming a distance of 125pc ) which is slightly over the critical mass .",
    "their result on the center - to - edge density contrast implies that b68 can adequately be supported by the thermal pressure without the support from turbulence and/or magnetic fields before the dynamical collapse takes place . as the best candidate of a bonnor - ebert sphere to date ,",
    "b68 has attracted great attention recently .",
    "langer & willacy ( 2001 ) used the iso 200@xmath9 m and 160@xmath9 m data and obtained a density profile that can be fitted by a series of power laws with exponents -1.2 , -2 , and -4 , going from center to edge , which is similar to the density profile of other pre - protostellar cores .",
    "recently the submillimeter dust continuum has been mapped at 450 and 850 @xmath9 m with scuba ( visser , richer , & chandler 2002 ) . however , to date , the extinction data of all2001 has the highest spatial resolution ( 3 ) and provides a robust density profile and estimate for its angular size .",
    "knowledge of the distance to the core ( to estimate the size and mass ) and temperature ( to estimate the thermal pressure ) are critical to characterize the true status of b68 as a prestellar core .",
    "hotzel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtain t@xmath28k from the excitation analysis of co lines and suggest that the previous temperature measurement from bourke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) contains calibration or calculation errors . in a later paper , hotzel , harju , & juvela ( 2002 ) also derived a kinetic temperature of 10@xmath101.2 k from the less depleted 3 . here , we present spectral line maps of b68 in 3h2 , ccs , and 3 to characterize its chemical status and to derive the temperature and turbulence in the core .",
    "our results when combined with the density structure derived from extinction data ( all2001 ) provide stringent constraints on the distance ( and thus , linear size and mass ) to the b68 core .",
    "we made single - dish maps of b68 in 3h2 , ccs , and 3 lines between january and july 2002 using nasa s deep space network ( dsn ) 70 m antenna at goldstone .",
    "we mapped b68 over @xmath244  region with nyquist sampling every 25  around the nominal center position from benson & myers ( 1989 ) at r.a.(1950)=17@xmath1119@xmath1236@xmath13 , dec.(1950)=@xmath14234713 .",
    "the maps were made with a k - band hemt receiver tunable between 1826 ghz .",
    "the spectra of these lines were taken with the two - million - channel wide band spectral analyzer ( wbsa ; quirk et al .",
    ". we co - added 256 adjacent channels in real time to produce a 8192 point spectrum with 5 khz spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we also used a dsn 34 m antenna and the wbsa to obtain the spectra of 3 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines simultaneously in order to derive the kinetic temperature of b68 .",
    "the spectrum were taken at ( 025 , 025 ) offset from the nominal center of b68 so that the 34 m beam includes most of the 3 emission .",
    "a ccs @xmath15 spectrum was also obtained with the dsn 34 m at ( 025 , 025 ) to determine the non - thermal linewidth . in table 1",
    "we list the observed transitions and their spatial and spectral resolutions .",
    "figure 1 shows our dsn 70 m maps of 3h2 , 3 , and ccs . the 3 map shows a centrally peaked distribution with the maximum close to the nominal center .",
    "by contrast , 3h2 and ccs both have their strongest peaks to the northeast of the 3 peak and their intensity decreases towards the southwest of the 3 peak .",
    "the 3h2 map shows a low level emission along the southwest edge .",
    "ccs has another strong peak at the southeast extension of b68 .",
    "the jcmt dust continuum maps of b68 at 850@xmath9 m ( visser , richer , & chandler 2002 ) and cs emission ( lada et al .",
    "2003 ) also show a distinct peak at the southeast extension , indicating this extension could be a separate core .    in figure 2",
    "we show an overlay of the 3 map with the 2h+ map obtained at the iram 30 m telescope ( bergin et al .",
    "2002 ) and the 200  @xmath9 m dust emission obtained with iso ( langer & willacy 2001 ) .",
    "we found that the 3 peak coincides with the dust continuum peak and is located between the two 2h+ peaks in the iram map .",
    "this result is consistent with the expectation of the chemical models that 3 and 2h+ are relatively more abundant in high density regions than other molecules .",
    "the double peak of 2h+ has been interpreted to indicate that even 2h+ depletes in the region with @xmath16mag .",
    "a similar depletion of 3 could take place in the center of b68 , but is not spatially resolved with our observations .      at low temperatures , where collisional excitation dominates , the rotation temperature of 3 can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines @xmath17 and the optical depth of the ( 1,1 ) main line @xmath18 ( ho & townes 1983 ) : @xmath19 we fitted our 34 m 3 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) hyperfine lines using the continuum and line analysis simple software ( class ) , and obtained @xmath20k and @xmath21 . from eq(1 ) , we derived @xmath22k ( lai et al .",
    "figure 4 show how the uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath23 varies with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the rotation temperature slightly underestimates the kinetic temperature @xmath24 in dark clouds ( walmsley & ungerechts 1983 ) , but it approaches the kinetic temperature when @xmath25 .",
    "we adopt @xmath26 in further calculations .",
    "independently , hotzel , harju , & juvela ( 2002 ) also measured a kinetic temperature of 10@xmath101.2k in b68 from 3 observations using the effelsberg 100 m telescope .",
    "the non - thermal linewidth ( fwhm ) , @xmath27 , can be estimated from @xmath28 .",
    "the observed linewidth @xmath29 can be obtained from the spectral line data .",
    "the thermal linewidth @xmath30 ( @xmath9 is the atomic weight and @xmath31 is the mass of a hydrogen atom ) can be calculated with the kinetic temperature determined in  3.2 .",
    "we derived @xmath27 from 3 and ccs separately .",
    "the multiple line fitting of 3 gives a reliable determination of the observed linewidth .",
    "the ccs molecule has a large atomic weight , and hence a narrower thermal linewidth .",
    "we derived for both 3 and ccs @xmath320.14  ( table 2 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with that observed from c@xmath33o line widths ( @xmath34 ) by lada et al .",
    "the @xmath27 , interpreted as that due to turbulence , is small  of the order of 0.3@xmath35(h@xmath5 ) .",
    "we calculate the column density of 3 , ccs , and 3h2 under the assumption of lte at two positions , one at the 3 peak and one at the ccs peak , in order to compare our results to the chemical evolution models .",
    "the derived column densities are listed in table 3 .",
    "the 3(1,1 ) hyperfine lines allow us to obtain the antenna temperature @xmath36 and the optical depth @xmath37 directly ; therefore , we can derive the excitation temperature @xmath38 of 3 from the radiative transfer equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the brightness temperature , @xmath41 is the cosmic background temperature , and @xmath420.7 is the main beam efficiency of the dsn 70 m antenna .",
    "the column density of 3 can be estimated with the knowledge of the excitation temperature @xmath38 , the line width @xmath43 and the main group opacity of the ( 1,1 ) line @xmath18 by the usual assumption that only metastable levels are populated ( harju , walmsley , & wouterloot 1993 ) , therefore @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the rotation temperature derived in  3.2 .",
    "we assume @xmath45 is constant across the core .",

    "a bonnor - ebert sphere is a hydrostatic self - gravitating isothermal core solely supported by its thermal pressure .",
    "the density profile of a bonnor - ebert sphere is characterized by only one parameter , the dimensionless radius parameter @xmath57 , @xmath58 where r is the core radius , @xmath59 is the central density , @xmath60 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath61 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "all2001 demonstrate that the density profile of b68 inferred from extinction is remarkably consistent with that of a bonnor - ebert sphere with @xmath57=6.9",
    ". however the results of our observations show that ( 1 ) b68 is colder than what all2001 assumed ( @xmath24=11k rather than 16k ) , and ( 2 ) thermal support dominates over turbulence , but that turbulent energy is present",
    ". the lower temperature will only affect the scaling of the density profile , but not the interpretation of the nature of b68 as a bonner - ebert sphere .",
    "we discuss how our observations constrain the parameters in @xmath57 , and hence the distance and the mass of b68 .",
    "we also consider an empirically modified bonnor - ebert sphere that includes turbulent and magnetic support .",
    "the density profile of the bonnor - ebert sphere can be used to constrain the distance and the mass of b68 with a temperature measurement . the distance to b68 itself is not well determined .",
    "b68 is spatially close to the ophiuchus complex , and the distance to the ophiuchus complex is between 80 and 170 pc with a central value of 125 pc ( de geus et al .",

    "we can express @xmath68 because @xmath57 and @xmath66 are fixed by observations , from eq(7 ) the number density at the center @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath70 is also related to the column density @xmath71 , where k is a constant which depends only on the shape of the density profile characterized by @xmath57 . because the central column density @xmath67 is fixed by observation , @xmath72 since @xmath69 and also @xmath73 , we find @xmath74 is a constant .",
    "therefore , the temperature measurement can be used to constrain the distance .",
    "all2001 assumed d=125pc and t=16 k , to derive a model consistent with @xmath75 and @xmath76 . with our measured temperature of 11",
    "k , b68 would have to be at a closer distance @xmath2 85 pc with a mass of @xmath2 1.0 @xmath62 for the same @xmath57 .",
    "this would place b68 on the near side of the ophiuchus complex .",
    "the isothermal bonnor - ebert sphere is supported purely by thermal pressure and does not include effects of turbulence or magnetic fields . turbulence and magnetic fields have been observed in some pre - protostellar cores and therefore they may provide significant support to the core stability .",
    "we present an empirical modification to the bonnor - ebert sphere that includes the turbulence and magnetic field support while preserving a bonner - ebert sphere - like density profile consistent with the observed @xmath57 .",
    "though empirical , such a representation is useful for a qualitative study of the core properties .",
    "the observed turbulence in b68 ( reported in this paper ) provides additional support to the core .",
    "we can incorporate the turbulent support by replacing the temperature in eq(7 ) with an effective temperature @xmath77 that includes both thermal and the turbulent pressures : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is obtained from the turbulence velocity width , @xmath80 .",
    "we can now modify eq(7 ) as @xmath81 we use eqs(8 ) & ( 9 ) and the observed @xmath24 and @xmath82 to constrain the distance of b68 to be 85100pc , as shown in figure 5a .",
    "eq(9 ) can be modified further to include a magnetic pressure term . however , in order to preserve the bonner - ebert - like density profile , this modification is possible only in cases where the magnetic pressure also varies radially as the thermal pressure .",
    "that is , magnetic pressure @xmath83 . coincidentally ,",
    "theoretical models of an axially symmetric isothermal core with magnetic flux freezing give @xmath84 ( fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ) , therefore magnetic pressure @xmath85 .",
    "zeeman observations in molecular clouds also support such a scaling law ( crutcher 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite eq(9 ) to include magnetic field support with @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the equivalent temperature corresponding to the magnetic pressure , @xmath88 . for simplicity",
    ", we express @xmath87 in terms of magnetic pressure using the average magnetic field @xmath89 and the average density @xmath90 .",

    "though eq(10 ) is valid only under certain conditions ( when @xmath93 scales as @xmath95 ) it is useful to show the dependence of the observed parameters on the physical conditions in the core .",
    "we use eq(10 ) to constrain the linear size ( or its distance ) for b68 as a function of kinetic temperature , turbulence , and magnetic field strengths as shown in figure 5 .",
    "for any given choice of turbulence with no magnetic fields , the distance and temperature along the lines shown in figure 5a represent stable cores that can be described with bonner - ebert density profiles , while those above and below represent supercritical and subcritical cores respectively . the shaded area in figure 5a marks the best estimate for distance consistent with our measurements of temperature and turbulence when magnetic support is ignored .",
    "figure 5b shows the distance , for which b68 will be static , as a function of increasing magnetic field derived using eqs(10 ) & ( 8) .",

    "because @xmath70 and @xmath90 are both proportional to @xmath97 , as long as @xmath57 and @xmath67 are fixed , the distance can be derived for any given @xmath89 .",
    "figure 5b indicates that if b68 is at distances beyond @xmath2100pc , then it can remain a stable core only if magnetic fields are present",
    ". however , under the flux freezing condition , the magnetic field should be responsible for the excitation of the non - thermal linewidths .",
    "the observed 0.14  non - thermal linewidths only gives @xmath98 g for density of 13@xmath99 3 .",
    "we conclude that the bonner - ebert - like density profile does not necessarily rule out the existence of the turbulence and magnetic fields , although their contributions are small in the case of b68 .",
    "the fact that b68 is dominated largely by thermal support suggests that the turbulence and the magnetic flux have been dissipated and the core could be on the verge of the collapse .",
    "the observed @xmath75 is slightly larger than the critical value 6.5 , which means the core is static but unstable , thus the gravitational collapse could occur with small perturbation .",
    "therefore , it is possible that b68 is slightly supercritical and could be undergoing slow contraction .",
    "the most well - known collapsing core l1544 has similar size and mass to b68 and its collapse velocity is @xmath100 0.1  ( lai & crutcher 2000 ) .",
    "if b68 collapses with a velocity of the same order of magnitude , the collapse motion should have been detected with our spectral resolution ( @xmath2 0.06 ) .",

    "b68 has been suggested to be a pre - protostellar core that can be described as a bonnor - ebert sphere at 16 k. our dsn 70 m maps show that b68 resembles the chemically differentiated structure seen in other pre - protostellar cores ; the 3 peak coincides with the dust continuum peak , whereas ccs and 3h2 are offset from the 3 peak .",
    "we derive a kinetic temperature @xmath2 11 k in b68 from 3 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations and turbulence of @xmath96 . here",
    "we derive an empirical formulation for a modified bonnor - ebert sphere that includes turbulent , and magnetic pressures , and allows us to constrain the distance to b68 using the observed kinetic temperature and turbulence .",
    "we estimate the distance to b68 to be @xmath2 95pc , on the near side of @xmath104 oph , with a corresponding core mass of @xmath2 1.0 @xmath0 .",
    "the sulfur species ccs and carbon chain molecule 3h2 are heavily depleted in b68 and do not trace the dense interior region .",
    "we show some evidence for depletion of 3 at the core center roughly on a scale similar to that of 2h+ .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for valuable comments and suggestions .",

    "<S> we have investigated the physical and chemical status of the pre - protostellar core b68 . a previous extinction study suggested that the density profile of b68 is remarkably consistent with a bonnor - ebert sphere with 2.1 @xmath0 at 16 k. we mapped b68 in 3h2 , ccs , and 3 with the deep space network ( dsn ) 70 m telescope at goldstone . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the 3 peak coincides with the dust continuum peak , whereas ccs and 3h2 are offset from the 3 and dust peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the b68 chemical structure is consistent with that seen in other such pre - protostellar cores ( l1498 , l1544 ) and is explained by time dependent chemical models that include depletion . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the kinetic temperature of b68 with 3 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) spectra obtained with a dsn 34 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the kinetic temperature of b68 is only 11 k which is significantly lower than that previously assumed . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the non - thermal linewidth in b68 , and show that b68 is thermally dominated with little contribution from turbulence support ( @xmath1 10% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a modified bonnor - ebert sphere to include effects of turbulence and magnetic fields and use it to constrain the uncertainties in its distance determination . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the distance to b68 is @xmath2 95pc with a corresponding mass of @xmath2 1.0 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if some magnetic field is present it can be further away ( beyond @xmath2 100pc ) and still satisfy the density structure of a bonnor - ebert sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the sulfur ( cs and ccs ) and carbon chain ( 3h2 ) molecules are heavily depleted in b68 and do not trace the dense interior region . </S>",
    "<S> we see some evidence for depletion of 3 at the core center roughly on a scale similar to that of 2h+ . </S>",
    "<S> our observations do not preclude any instability such as the onset of collapse , or slow contraction , occurring in the center of the core , which can not be resolved with our beam size ( 45@xmath3 ) . </S>"
