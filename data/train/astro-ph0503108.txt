    "the irfm was first introduced by blackwell & shallis ( 1977 ) as a mean to simultaneously determine the effective temperature and angular diameter of a star .",

    "the infrared is due to the relatively low dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath3 in this region of the spectrum ( see e.g. fig . 1 in blackwell et  al .",
    "1979 ) .",
    "a more practical approach to the irfm was given by blackwell et  al .",
    "( 1980 ) , who defined the @xmath28-factors as the quotients between the total and monochromatic fluxes .",

    "the irfm is often applied using more than one infrared wavelength ( @xmath32 ) , and a different @xmath3 is obtained for each @xmath32 . a critical ingredient of the irfm is the absolute flux calibration of the standard star from which the @xmath27 fluxes of the problem stars are calculated . if @xmath33 are the absolute monochromatic fluxes for the standard star , then @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the observed magnitude in a given band for which @xmath32 is , for example , the mean wavelength of the filter . the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 )",
    "factors are required since the filters have finite widths and are not usually narrow in the infrared .",
    "it would be ideal to calculate the @xmath36 factors from spectrophotometric observations but in practice models are adopted ( see the appendix in aam94a for a discussion on this particular point ) .    for the irfm",
    ", the absolute flux calibration for the standard star must be done in such a way that the temperatures obtained in different wavelengths are close to each other and , when properly averaged , consistent with the direct temperatures .",
    "a calibration of this kind is that of aam94a and is the one we have used in our work .",
    "even though it was derived using direct temperatures of giant stars , this calibration provides good temperatures for dwarf stars as well , as it was shown in rm04b , where the comparison of irfm angular diameters with measured ones for 7 main sequence stars showed good agreement ( see also  [ sect : irfmvsdiam ] for an update ) .",

    "the use of classical model atmospheres may not be a big issue for the irfm .",

    "note that the zero point of the e93 theoretical calibration was set using a sample of stars with temperatures derived from balmer line - profile fitting ( cayrel de strobel 1990 ) and so the similarity between the differences found with e93 and f98 may be due to the same basic technique employed .",

    "finally , the line - depth ratio technique has been applied to 181 dwarfs by k03 , 44 of them are included in our sample .",
    "it is claimed that very small errors , of the order of 10 k or less , may be achieved with this technique if several calibrated ratios are used . the comparison with our irfm temperatures , however , shows a dispersion that is larger than the one expected by the combination of the errors in the irfm temperatures ( @xmath140  k ) with those suggested by k03 , which will be essentially equal to the uncertainty from the irfm .",
    "it is true that very small _ individual _ uncertainties ( that is , for a single star ) may be achieved with the line - depth ratio technique , but some systematic effects may enlarge the dispersion in the @xmath3 scale derived with this technique , which is , however , potentially useful for studying intrinsic temperature fluctuations .",
    "k03 adjusted their @xmath3 scale to reproduce the solar temperature , hence the good agreement with the irfm around 5800  k and solar metallicity . from 5500  k to 6200  k , however , k03 temperatures become lower than the irfm ones . from 4500  k to 5500  k , a mean difference of about @xmath164  k is observed , and it seems to go to zero again at lower temperatures .",

    "the status of this particular irfm implementation is revised and it is shown that the irfm temperatures are well scaled to the direct ones for main sequence stars . the case for giant stars",
    "was proved in the past and the present work confirms the good agreement .",
    "the present work improves the irfm @xmath3 scale by the use of up - to - date spectroscopic atmospheric parameters and the inclusion of stars in the ranges where few or no data were previously studied .",
    "our irfm approach , however , is largely based on the aam study , and a comparison of our updated to aam temperatures shows agreement within error bars .",
    "we point out that the influence of the bolometric flux calibrations adopted on our irfm temperatures is important because they may introduce systematic trends in the resulting @xmath3 scale .",
    "however , we have also shown that the systematic trends may not be larger than 50  k , and so , if differences larger than 50  k are found with other @xmath3 scales , they should not be attributed solely to the fluxes adopted in the irfm .",
    "this number ( 50  k ) is a conservative estimate , and thus even smaller differences may not be totally due to errors in the bolometric fluxes .",
    "comparison of the stellar angular diameters from the irfm with those measured by interferometry , lunar occultation or transit observations shows good agreement .",
    "this work thus provides accurate stellar angular diameters , which are essential to calibrate extremely high - resolution long - baseline interferometric observations ( e.g. vlt and chara interferometers ) .",

    "the irfm temperature of the sun is only about 20  k below the standard value , and those of the well studied stars procyon and arcturus are consistent with the direct ones and those derived with other methods within the error bars .",
