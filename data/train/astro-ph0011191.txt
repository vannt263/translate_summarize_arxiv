    "the phenomenon of gravitational lensing is extremely useful for understanding the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "studying the observed properties of the images in individual lenses can provide knowledge of the mass distribution and mass to light ratio in these lenses ( grogin and narayan , 1996 ; tyson , kochaski and dellantonio , 1996 ) .",
    "a statistical analysis of the observed lens systems on the other hand can help us to restrict the values of the cosmological parameters ( falco , kochanek and munoz , 1998 ; link and pierce , 1998 ) . based on the frequency of gravitational lensing",
    ", upper limits have been placed on the value of the cosmological constant ( fukugita et al 1992 , kochanek , 1996 ) .",
    "it has recently been pointed out by park and gott ( 1997 , hereafter pg ) that the image separations of the observed lenses are strongly negatively correlated with source redshifts , z@xmath2 , the anti - correlation being much stronger than that predicted by standard cosmologies .",
    "pg considered several possible ways to strengthen the anti - correlation .",
    "a steeper mass profile , merger of galaxies and increase in their mass by in - fall strengthen the anti - correlation , but not sufficiently to explain the observations .",
    "pg considered point masses and singular isothermal spheres ( siss ) for the lenses and assumed all the lenses to be identical .",
    "they also , did not consider the effect of amplification bias in their calculation of average image separation .",
    "williams ( 1997 , hereafter llrw ) showed that the theoretical upper limit to the image separations shows a strong anti - correlation with the source redshift , consistent with the observations , provided ( i ) the lensing galaxies have logarithmic surface mass densities that gradually change with radius , ( ii ) there is a dispersion in the lensing properties of galaxies like the central surface mass density or velocity dispersion and ( iii ) the characteristic length scale of dark matter halos of galaxies scales as l@xmath3 , with a@xmath4 0.4 .",
    "more data on lensed qsos have become available since 1997 and the number of lensed qsos is now roughly twice the number in the pg sample .",
    "the pg sample also contained some doubtful lenses .",
    "the new data set has to be examined afresh for the presence or absence of the correlation between image separation and source redshift .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to analyze the currently available data to look for a possible correlation .",
    "we then want to compare the observed distribution of average image separation as a function of source redshift with the results of a detailed calculation of statistical lensing of galaxies , with a view of obtaining constraints on the values of various parameters entering the calculations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the analysis of the data using various statistical tests to quantify the presence of any correlation .",
    "calculations for lensing statistics in particular of the average image separation as a function of source redshift , for flat universe , for realistic lens distributions , taking into account the amplification bias , for different cosmological models are presented in section 3 . in section 4 and 5",
    "we present the results and conclusions respectively .",
    "the anti - correlation noted by pg is , as observed by them , mainly due to five low redshift ( z@xmath52.15 ) , large separation ( @xmath6 greater than 4@xmath7 ) images , namely , 0240 - 343 , 0957 + 561 , 1120 + 019 , 1429 - 008 and 2345 + 007 . out of these , only one ( 0957 + 561 ) was a confirmed lens .",
    "since then kochanek , falco and munoz ( 1999 ) have argued against the lensed nature of most of the wide separation qso pairs ( hereafter wsqps ) .",
    "studying the optical and radio properties of these pairs they concluded that all of the wsqps , with @xmath6 between 3 @xmath7 and 10 @xmath7 are binary quasars rather than gravitationally lensed images with a one sided 2 @xmath8 ( 1 @xmath8 ) upper limit of 22@xmath9 ( 8@xmath9 ) on the lens fraction of these qso pairs .",
    "they explained the high incidence of occurrence of binary qsos ( which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that given by the quasar - quasar correlation function ) as being due to the enhanced quasar activity during the merger of galaxies .",
    "no lensing galaxy could be found in front of these wsqps so that if they are lensed images , the lensing mass , though of the magnitude of a cluster , has to be completely invisible .",
    "peng et al ( 1999 ) have searched for a lensing galaxy in front of q1634 + 267 at the lens optical wavelength using nicmos and showed that the lens has to have m / l @xmath10 690 h@xmath11 ( 1200 h@xmath11 ) for @xmath12 = 0.1 ( 1.0 ) and h@xmath13 = 65 h@xmath11 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "they therefore , suggest that the double `` images '' may be binary qsos rather than multiple images of a single qso .",
    "very similar spectra of the two `` images '' , however , defies this conclusion .",
    "peng et al ( 1999 ) have compared the spectral similarities of 14 pairs of qsos with separations between 3 @xmath7 and 10 @xmath7 which are having very similar redshifts ( with the velocity differences between pairs being @xmath15 500 km s@xmath14 ) with the spectral similarities of randomly chosen qso pairs from the lbqs .",
    "they conclude that there is @xmath16 probability that a randomly drawn sample of 14 qso pairs would show as similar spectra as the observed pairs .",
    "so unless a viable theory to explain the similarities of the spectra of qsos in merging galaxies can be developed , one can not discard the lens hypothesis for the wsqps .",
    "new data on lensed qsos have become available since 1997 .",
    "49 confirmed or likely lenses have been compiled by the cfa / arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles ) , out of which the source redshift is available for 39 qsos .",
    "these include 15 lenses from the pg sample . for reasons stated above we may combine these with the 5 wsqps from the pg sample ( 0240 , 1120 , 1429 , 1634 and 2345 ) to get an extended sample of 44 lenses .",
    "we have considered 4 separate samples for our analysis , namely ( 1 ) pg20 ; the sample used by pg of 20 qsos ( 2 ) pg15 ; pg sample without the 5 wsqps ( 3 ) cast39 ; the castles sample of 39 lenses and ( 4 ) ext44 ; the extended sample containing 39 castles lenses and 5 wsqps .",
    "the angular separation vs source redshift for these samples are plotted in figures 1a , 1b , 1c , 1d respectively .",
    "these samples were searched for the presence of correlation by performing spearman rank correlation test .",
    "ks test was also performed to determine if the image separations for sources with redshift smaller than 2.5 and sources with redshift greater than 2.5 are taken from the same distribution .",
    "we also obtained best straight line fits to the unbinned data of the four samples which are plotted in the figure .",
    "the results are shown in table i. it is clear that pg20 shows highly significant anti - correlation between @xmath17 and z@xmath18 . the anti - correlation weakens but persists at about 1.8 @xmath8 level after the removal of the 5 wsqps ( pg15 ) .",
    "castles data on the other hand do not show any correlation . adding the 5 wsqps to castles data ( ext44 ) gives rise to anti - correlation but it is very weak and is statistically insignificant .",
    "ks test also shows that for ext44 sample the probability that the lens separations for sources with redshift smaller than and larger than 2.5 are taken from the same distribution is quite large .",
    "we thus conclude that the strong anti - correlation noted by pg was mainly due to the inclusion of 5 questionable qsos which formed a large fraction of about 25% of their sample .",
    "the present data of 39 confirmed lenses does not show any correlation by itself and even after the inclusion of the 5 questionable lenses which now form only 11% of the sample .",
    "as seen above no correlation exists between the image separations and the source redshifts and it seems possible that results of the standard theoretical models may be consistent with the observations without the need of any drastic assumptions .",
    "it is possible that we may be able to constrain some of the parameters entering the calculations . in this section",
    "we present the details of our calculation of lensing statistics which differ from previous calculations only in the way the amplification bias has been taken into account .",
    "we have assumed the mass distribution of the lenses to be that of iscs as found to be required by maoz and rix ( 1993 ) in order to explain the lensing events in the hst snapshot survey .",
    "we have not taken into account the effects of ellipticity in the lensing galaxies .",
    "as the ellipticity mainly affects the relative numbers of double and quadruple lenses ( keeton et al , 1997 ) it will not affect our results .",
    "for the lens distribution as a function of mass and redshift we consider the schechter luminosity function of galaxies and the mass condensations in a cold dark matter universe obtained using press - schechter theory ( hereafter referred to as the ps distribution ) .",
    "the former is given by @xmath19 @xmath20 ( l ) being the number of galaxies with luminosity l per unit comoving volume . here , @xmath21",
    "= -1.1 ( marzke et al , 1998 ) .",
    "we have assumed the comoving number density of galaxies to be independent of redshift .",
    "the circular velocity dependence of the luminosity is taken to be l / l@xmath22 km s@xmath14 for elliptical galaxies ( faber & jackson , 1976 , de vaucouleurs & olson , 1982 , kochanek , 1994 ) and",
    "l / l@xmath23 km s@xmath14 for spiral galaxies ( tully & fisher,1977 , fukugita and turner , 1991 ) , which are assumed to be 70 @xmath9 of all the galaxies ( postman and geller , 1984 ) .",
    "the ps distribution is given by @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the number density of mass condensations with circular velocity @xmath26 at redshift z , @xmath27 = 1.68 and the functional form of @xmath28 for the cdm power spectrum of density perturbation is @xmath29 where b is the bias parameter .",
    "the mass and circular velocity of a halo are related to the comoving radius r@xmath30 and redshift z by , @xmath31 @xmath32 being the mean density of the universe .",
    "the density fluctuation amplitudes are taken from n - body simulation work ( narayan and white , 1988 , mo , miralda - escude and rees , 1993 ) .",
    "we consider several flat world models with different values of the cosmological constant .",
    "following fukugita et al ( 1992 ) , we use the angular diameter distances between the lens and the observer ( @xmath33 ) between the source and the observer ( @xmath34 ) and between the lens and the source ( @xmath35 ) and take the critical impact parameter for sis lens to be @xmath36 @xmath37 being the one component velocity dispersion for the lens equal to @xmath38 .",
    "the angular diameter distance formulae for various types of world models are taken from fukugita et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "the lensing cross - section for isc is given by ( hinshaw and krauss 1987 ) @xmath39 being the maximum impact parameter for lensing , given by @xmath40^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath41 being the core radius of the lens mass distribution .",
    "the amplification of an image is obtained from @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the impact parameter and @xmath44 is the image position in the lens plane obtained by solving the lens equation + @xmath45 the average image separation for a given value , z@xmath18 , is given by @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the separation between the two brighter images produced by a lens at z@xmath48 with circular velocity @xmath49 and impact parameter @xmath43 and @xmath50 is the number of observable sources ( with m@xmath51m@xmath52 ) at the redshift z@xmath18 which will be lensed by galaxies at a redshift z@xmath48 with circular velocity @xmath49 and impact parameter @xmath43 , such that both of the brighter images will have luminosity higher than that for @xmath53 .",
    "this can be obtained multiplying the qso luminosity function by the optical depth for lensing and integrating over the observable magnitude interval .",
    "this can be written as @xmath54 here , m@xmath55 is the absolute magnitude of a source at z@xmath18 corresponding to the limiting apparent magnitude m@xmath55 of the survey , assumed here to be 18 .",
    "the results are quite insensitive to the value of m@xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 is the amplification of the weaker of the two bright images and @xmath57 is the qso luminosity function , which is taken from wallington and narayan ( 1993 ) .",
    "@xmath58 is the optical depth for lensing of a source at z@xmath18 by lenses with velocity dispersion @xmath49 at redshift z@xmath48 with impact parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this is given by @xmath59 n@xmath60 being the number density of the lenses with circular velocity @xmath49 at z@xmath48 and 2 @xmath61 being the crosssection for lensing for impact parameters between @xmath43 and @xmath62 .",
    "the unnormalized probability of lensing for a given image separation @xmath63 can be computed from @xmath64 where , @xmath65 is the observable number of qsos ( obtained as above by multiplying the qso luminosity function with the optical depth of lensing and integrating over the observable magnitude range ) lensed by lenses at redshift z@xmath48 with impact parameter @xmath43 producing image separation @xmath63 , a(z@xmath18,z@xmath66 ) is the amplification of the weaker of the two bright images with image separation @xmath63 and @xmath67 @xmath49 being the circular velocity of lenses at z@xmath48 which will yield the image separation @xmath63 for impact parameter @xmath43 . for this calculation",
    "we have ignored the dependence of image separation on impact parameter which is very weak ( hinshaw & krauss , 1987 ) and have used the value of image separation by the iscs at zero impact parameter .",
    "we have verified that this assumption does not lead to errors larger than 1 @xmath9 .",
    "this is given by @xmath68 the value of @xmath69 for given @xmath70 obtained from the above equation is used to obtain the necessary value of @xmath49 as @xmath71 .",
    "we have plotted in figure 2a the unnormalized differential probability @xmath72 as a function of image separation for the two lens distribution functions for several redshifts .",
    "we have used a value of 0.2 kpc for the core radius for these calculations .",
    "this is the upper limit obtained by wallington and narayan ( 1993 ) from the observed absence of central images for the lensed qsos .",
    "models of individual lenses imply somewhat lower core radii ( kochanek , 1995 ) .",
    "an upper limit of 1.4 kpc has been obtained from the results of n body simulations of gravitational collapse of density peaks by dubinski and carlberg ( 1991 ) .",
    "the slope of the lens distribution ( as a function of luminosity or circular velocity ) for schechter luminosity function is steeper than that for the ps distribution . as a result",
    "the probability distribution is broader for the ps distribution compared to that for the schechter distribution .",
    "the slope of the probability distribution , for each lens distribution is , however , almost independent of the source redshift for @xmath73 which indicates that the average value of @xmath74 may not be very sensitive to z@xmath18 .",
    "figures 2b and 2c show the effect of varying the values of various parameters on the differential probability distribution .",
    "figure 2b shows that increasing the core radius suppresses the probability for small values of separations ( curves 2,3,4,5 ) .",
    "however , again , the slope of the distribution is independent of the value of the core radius for @xmath75 for r@xmath76 0.2 kpc .",
    "the image separation increases with the increase in core radius as the probability for small separations is suppressed ( hinshaw and krauss , 1987 ) .",
    "however , the effect of including the amplification bias ( which increases the probability for small values of @xmath63 as can be seen by comparing curves 3 and 6 ) cancels the effect of the increase in the core radius as has been noted by hinshaw and krauss ( 1887 ) .",
    "this results in the probability distribution being almost independent of r@xmath77 for @xmath75 for the assumed range of r@xmath77 values .",
    "higher values of core radius change the probability distribution more significantly for larger values of separations .",
    "the effect of increasing the bias parameter is to reduce the probability for large values of @xmath63 as seen by comparing curve 1 and 3 . in figure 2c",
    "we have plotted the probability distribution for three cosmological models , including the cosmic concordance model proposed by ostriker and steinhaardt ( 1995 ) . for ps distribution the peak shifts to lower @xmath63 values with increase in @xmath78 .",
    "the average image separation as a function of redshift has been plotted in figure 3 for several values of parameters . in this figure",
    "we have also plotted the observed image separations and the best fit straight lines for the ext44 sample ( small dashed line ) and for the cast39 sample ( long dashed line ) .",
    "it is well known that the ps distribution tends to over predict large separation lenses ( kochanek , 1994 ; flores @xmath79 primack , 1996 ) . as a result",
    "the predicted average image separations are large compared to the observed values . in plotting the results in figure 3 we have used a cutoff on the mass of the condensations .",
    "the probability distribution for a cutoff of 600 km s@xmath14 is shown in fig2a for comparison .",
    "as is expected , the absence of large masses reduces the probability for large separations drastically .",
    "porciani et al ( 2000 ) have shown that the probability of lensing is consistent with observations if one assumes that the condensations with mass @xmath80m@xmath1 have non - singular mass distribution . however , as explained above , for r@xmath81 0.2 kpc the effect of finite core radius is partly compensated by the amplification bias for @xmath82 and it is not possible to suppress the probability for separations @xmath83 . a cutoff on the mass of condensation",
    "is therefore needed to reduce the probability for these separations .",
    "figure 3a shows that the @xmath17 values are almost independent of the source redshift .",
    "the decrease of @xmath17 with z@xmath18 is somewhat more pronounced for the assumption of ps distribution for small values ( @xmath15 2 ) of z@xmath18 .",
    "the decrease is larger when the distance formulae for empty beam are used compared to that for the case of filled beam ( curves 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath6 are sensitive to the values of the upper limit on the circular velocity of the condensations used in the calculation .",
    "an increase in the upper limit from 750 km s@xmath14 to 1000 km s@xmath14 increases the values of @xmath17 by a factor @xmath101.5 ( curves 2 and 4 ) .",
    "change in the bias parameter ( curves 4 and 6 ) again changes the absolute values but does not alter the slope of the distribution . as expected from fig 2b ,",
    "the values of @xmath17 are almost independent of the core radius ( curves 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we thus see that the observed image separation as a function of redshift ( as seen from the best fit line ) is in reasonable agreement ( in view of the uncertainties of the best fit given in table i ) with the theoretical results for an upper limit on circular velocity of about 600 - 750 km s@xmath14 for b=1 for ps distribution .",
    "this value of course is not absolute as higher values will be needed for higher bias parameters .",
    "use of schechter luminosity function , however , produces considerably lower values of @xmath17 .    in figure 3b",
    "we have shown the results for different assumptions about the change in the core radius with redshift and with circular velocities of the condensations as suggested by llrw .",
    "assuming @xmath41 @xmath84 ( curves 4 , 5 and 6 ) does not change the results significantly .",
    "similarly the assumption of a redshift dependence of @xmath41 @xmath85 ( curves 1 and 2 ) also changes the results only by a small amount .",
    "this is expected in view of the very weak dependence of @xmath17 on core radius .",
    "thus the observed absence of correlation is consistent with the results for a flat universe even if the core radius varies with luminosity contrary to the suggestion of llrw . in figure 3c",
    "we have plotted the results for different cosmologies .",
    "values of @xmath17 decrease with increase in @xmath78 .",
    "the results presented above show that the average image separation is not very sensitive to ( i ) the values of core radii ( ii ) different assumptions about the dependences of core radii on luminosity or redshift and ( iii ) the values of cosmological constant between 0 and @xmath40.65 .",
    "the values are sensitive to the upper limit used for the circular velocity for the ps distribution . for b= 1 ,",
    "core radii between 0 and 0.2 kpc and cosmological constant between 0 and @xmath4 0.65 , an upper limit of about 600 - 750 km s@xmath14 on the circular velocities of the dark matter halos for the ps distribution is roughly consistent with the observations of image separations .",
    "it may be noted that the observed values of image separations do show considerable scatter at any given source redshift .",
    "a large scatter is expected from the flat probability distributions as a function of @xmath86 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the differential probability of lensing as a function of angular separation can not be directly compared with the observations due to the small number of observed lenses at any given redshift . however",
    ", if we take all the observed lenses together , irrespective of their redshifts , then we see that 6 out of 49 lenses in the full castles data and 11 out of 54 in the extended data including the wsqps have image separation between 3 @xmath7 and 8 @xmath7 .",
    "this requires the ratio of probabilities for separations between 3 @xmath7 and 8 @xmath7 to that for separations between 0.3@xmath7 and 3 @xmath7 to be 0.14 and 0.26 respectively for the two samples .",
    "we have calculated this probability ratio to be 0.62 , 0.35 and 0.15 for upper limits of 750 , 600 and 500 km s@xmath14 respectively for the ps distribution for b=1 , @xmath12=1 and @xmath41=0.2 kpc .",
    "the ratio is 0.04 for the schechter function .",
    "keeton , christlein and zabludoff ( 2000 ) have considered the detailed galactic luminosity function dependent upon type and environment ( bromley 1998a , b ) .",
    "they obtained a good match between their calculated probability and the image separation distribution for 49 qso lenses in the castles data .",
    "we have calculated the probability distribution and the average image separation using the luminosity function used by them .",
    "the results are shown in figs 1c and 3c .",
    "the probability peaks at a higher value of image separation and as a result the values of @xmath17 are higher and can be considered to be in agreement with the cast39 sample .",
    "however we note that even for this luminosity function it is not possible to get values of image separations larger than 6 @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio of probabilities for separations between 3 @xmath7 and 8 @xmath7 to that for separations between 0.3@xmath7 and 3 @xmath7 is 0.12 .",
    "we have analyzed the observed image separations of lensed qsos for a possible correlation with the source redshift .",
    "a correlation was earlier noted for the then available data by pg .",
    "the present data of 39 confirmed or likely lensed qsos , even when combined with 5 wide separation qso pairs which are doubtful lenses , do not show any statistically significant correlation .",
    "llrw had shown that if the core radii scale with luminosity as l@xmath87 then an anti - correlation is expected theoretically because of the presence of dispersion in lensing properties of galaxies .",
    "we have calculated the average image separations of the lensed qsos as a function of source redshifts , for isothermal spheres with cores in a flat universe , taking into account the amplification bias caused by lensing .",
    "we do not find the strong anti - correlation stipulated by llrw .",
    "in fact the shape of the distribution of average image separation as a function of source redshift is very robust and is insensitive to the change in parameters . as a result we are unable to obtain meaningful constraints on any of the parameters .",
    "the assumption of the schechter luminosity function is unable to produce separations larger than 6 @xmath7 .",
    "the use of ps distribution on the other hand yields large number of wide separation lenses even for non - zero core radius and nessecitates the assumption of a cutoff on the mass of the condensations or large values of core radii for condensations with large masses .",
    "it may be noted that the ps distribution has also been found to be remarkably successful in explaining the observed distributions of the qso absorption lines ( das & khare , 1999 ) .",

    "<S> we have analyzed the observed image separations of the gravitationally lensed images of qsos for a possible correlation with the source redshift . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the previously noted anti - correlation based on a smaller data set , no correlation is found for the currently available data . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the average image separations of the lensed qsos as a function of source redshifts , for isothermal spheres with cores in a flat universe , taking into account the amplification bias caused by lensing . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the distribution of average image separation as a function of redshift is very robust and is insensitive to most model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> observations are found to be roughly consistent with the theoretical results for models which assume the lens distribution to be ( i ) schechter luminosity function which , however , can not produce images with large separation and ( ii ) the mass condensations in a cold dark matter universe , as given by the press - schechter theory if an upper limit of 1 - 7@xmath0 m@xmath1 is assumed on the mass of the condensations . </S>"
