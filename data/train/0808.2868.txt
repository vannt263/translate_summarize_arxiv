    "solar -neutrino spectroscopy has been so far performed by the water erenkov  detectors kamiokande , superkamiokande , and sno  @xcite .",
    "the first two experiments used elastic @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering for the detection of neutrinos , whereas sno also exploited nuclear reaction channels on deuterium with heavy water as target .",
    "these experiments provided robust spectral measurements with @xmath105mev threshold or higher for scattered electrons ; a recent sno analysis reached a 3.5mev threshold  @xcite .",
    "we report the first observation of solar -neutrinos with a liquid scintillator detector , performed by the borexino experiment  @xcite via elastic @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering .",
    "borexino is the first experiment to succeed in suppressing all major backgrounds , above the 2.614mev @xmath11 from the decay of , to a rate below that of electron scatterings from solar neutrinos .",
    "this allows to reduce the energy threshold for scattered electrons by  solar neutrinos to 3mev , the lowest ever reported for the electron scattering channel . to facilitate a comparison to the results of superkamiokande @xcite and sno d@xmath12o phase @xcite",
    ", we also report the measured  neutrino interaction rate with 5mev threshold .",
    "since borexino also detected low energy solar  neutrinos  @xcite , this is the first experiment where both branches of the solar -cycle have been measured simultaneously in the same target .",
    "the large mixing angle solution ( lma ) of the msw effect  @xcite predicts a transition in the @xmath13 survival probability from the vacuum oscillation regime at low energies to the matter dominated regime at high energies .",
    "results on solar  and  neutrinos from borexino , combined with prediction on the absolute neutrino fluxes from the standard solar model  @xcite , confirm that our data are in agreement with the msw - lma prediction within 1@xmath9 .",
    "the borexino detector is located at the underground laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) in central italy , at a depth of 3600m.w.e .. solar neutrinos are detected in borexino exclusively via elastic @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering in a liquid scintillator .",
    "the active target consists of 278 t of pseudocumene ( pc , 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene ) , doped with 1.5g / l of ppo ( 2,5-diphenyloxazole , a fluorescent dye ) .",
    "the scintillator is contained in a thin ( 125@xmath14 m ) nylon vessel of 4.25 m nominal radius , and is shielded by two concentric pc buffers ( 323 and 567 t ) doped with 5.0g / l of a scintillation light quencher ( dimethylphthalate ) .",
    "scintillator and buffers are contained in a stainless steel sphere ( sss ) with a diameter of 13.7 m and the scintillation light is detected via 2212 8 ",
    "photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) uniformly distributed on the inner surface of the sss .",
    "the two pc buffers are separated by a second thin nylon membrane to prevent diffusion of the radon emanated by the pmts and by the stainless steel of the sphere into the scintillator .",
    "the sss is enclosed in a 18.0 m diameter , 16.9 m high domed water tank ( wt ) , containing 2100 t of ultra - pure water as an additional shielding against external gamma- and neutron background .",
    "pmts in the wt detect the erenkov  light produced by muons in the water shield , serving as a highly efficient muon veto .",
    "a complete description of the borexino detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "scintillator detectors , with their high light yield , are sensitive to lower energy events than erenkov  detectors . in this analysis ,",
    "the 3mev energy threshold is imposed mainly by the 2.614mev @xmath11-rays from the decay of  (  chain , @xmath15=5.001mev ) in the pmts and in the sss and by the finite energy resolution of the detector : a tail of 2.6 mev @xmath11 events leaks at higher energies , along with a very small percentage of combined @xmath11 s from  (  chain , @xmath15=3.272mev ) .",
    "the 3mev energy threshold eliminates sample contamination from such events .",
    "potential background sources above 3mev include the radioactive decays of residual   and   within the liquid scintillator , decays of cosmogenic isotopes ( see table  [ tab : cosmogenic ] later ) , high energy @xmath11-rays from neutron capture , and cosmic muons .",
    "no background from @xmath16 decays is expected at these energies , since the light quenching of @xmath16 s in organic liquid scintillators reduces their visible energy in the electron - equivalent scale below 1mev . a measurement of  neutrinos with a 3mev energy threshold is contingent upon high radiopurity of the scintillator target",
    ".  and  concentrations in the borexino scintillator have been measured at ( 1.6@xmath40.1@xmath1710@xmath18g / g and ( 6.8@xmath41.5)@xmath510@xmath19g / g , respectively , and record low levels of backgrounds in the energy range 0.2 - 5.0mev have been reported  @xcite . the dominant background in the energy range of interest for solar  neutrinos originates from spallation processes of high energy cosmic muons .",
    "this paper demonstrates that , thanks to the lngs depth and the borexino muon veto system , cosmogenic background can be reduced below the rate of interaction of  neutrinos , thus allowing the neutrino rate to be measured .",
    "we tuned the response of energy and position reconstruction algorithms with a dedicated calibration campaign .",
    "we used an off - axis source insertion system designed to position radioactive and/or luminous sources at several locations throughout the detector active target .",
    "the source position can be measured with a set of stereoscopic cameras installed on the sss with an uncertainty of @xmath42 cm in @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xcite ( @xmath43.5 cm in radius ) .    as explained above",
    ", borexino has a unique sensitivity to electron scattering from low energy solar neutrinos , thanks to its unmatched record on background below the natural radioactivity barrier . to preserve this capability ,",
    "the off - axis source insertion system was designed to respect stringent limits on leak tightness and cleanliness of the mechanics in contact with the liquid scintillator .",
    "a detailed description of the technique used for the calibration and for the position reconstruction in borexino is in preparation .",
    "calibration of the energy scale allows to establish with high confidence the energy threshold for the  neutrino analysis and the error in its determination , and to calibrate the energy scale to allow the energy spectrum of the electrons scattered by  neutrinos to be determined .",
    "distortions of the energy scale are due to physical effects ( quenching ) , geometrical effects ( light collection ) , and to the electronics , which was designed for optimal performance in the low - energy range of  neutrinos , in a regime where a single photoelectron is expected for each pmt . at higher energies ,",
    "the electronics response to multiple photoelectron hits on a single channel is not linear . for each triggered channel ,",
    "the charge from photoelectrons in a 80ns gate is integrated and recorded , but photoelectrons in the following 65ns dead time window are lost .",
    "the resulting fraction of lost charge increases with energy and can reach @xmath1010% at @xmath1010 mev . moreover , the number of detected photoelectrons depends on the event position in the active volume , due to differences in pmt coverage . for an accurate determination of the energy scale ,",
    "the dominant non - linearities have been reproduced with a monte carlo simulation and with calibration measurements .    to avoid contamination during calibration ,",
    "@xmath23  sources were not put in direct contact with the scintillator .",
    "instead , we calibrated the response of the detector with encapsulated @xmath11  sources .",
    "the scintillation induced by @xmath11-rays is due to the ionizing tracks of the secondary electrons , thus , the two energy scales are closely related .    establishing a correlation between the @xmath23 and @xmath11 energy scales required extensive simulations with the g4bx  monte carlo code .",
    "g4bx  is based on geant4  @xcite and simulates in detail all of the detector component , and includes scintillation , erenkov  photon production , absorption and scattering of light in the scintillator and in the buffer , as well as the pmt response .",
    "each secondary electron in a @xmath11-induced compton electron cascade is affected by energy - dependent ionization quenching , which amplifies the distortion in the @xmath11 energy scale .",
    "the quenching effect is modeled with the birks formalism  @xcite .",
    "a second package , bxelec , simulates in detail the response of the electronics .",
    "finally , monte carlo data are processed by the same reconstruction code used for real data .",
    "a detailed description of the monte carlo codes and of the energy reconstruction algorithm is in preparation .    to calibrate the detector energy response to  neutrinos",
    ", we used an @xmath24am@xmath25be neutron source positioned at the center of the detector and at several positions at 3  m radius .",
    "neutron capture on @xmath26h and on @xmath27c in the scintillator results in the emission of @xmath11-rays from the 2.223mev and 4.945mev excited states , respectively .",
    "in addition , neutron capture on the stainless steel of the insertion system produces @xmath11-rays from the 7.631mev ( @xmath28fe ) and 9.298mev ( @xmath29fe ) excited states .",
    "we validate the monte carlo code by simulating the four @xmath11-rays in both the positions . in figure",
    "[ fig : enecal ] we show the results of the calibration of the @xmath11-equivalent energy scale in the detector center .",
    "monte carlo simulations reproduce @xmath11 peak positions and resolutions at @xmath30 = 1% precision in the detector center ( as shown in figure [ fig : enecal ] ) , and at @xmath31 = 4% precision at 3 m from the detector s center . assuming the same accuracy for the @xmath23-equivalent energy scale , we extrapolate it by simulating electrons uniformly distributed in the scintillator , and then selecting those with reconstructed position within the fiducial volume .",
    "the error on the energy scale is obtained with a linear interpolation from @xmath30 in the detector center to @xmath31 at 3 m , along the radius .",
    "the @xmath23-equivalent energy scale , in the energy region above 2  mev , can be parametrized as :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the number of photoelectrons ( p.e . ) detected by the pmts , @xmath34=459@xmath411p.e./mev and @xmath35=115@xmath438p.e .. the non - zero intercept @xmath35 is related to the fact that this description is valid only in this energy range and that the overall relation between @xmath33 and @xmath36 is non linear .",
    "the anticipated 3mev ( 5mev ) energy threshold for the  analysis corresponds to 1494p.e .",

    "we computed with g4bx  a probability density function ( pdf ) for the time of transit of photons from their emission point to their detection as photoelectron signals in the electronics chain .",
    "we refined the pdf with data collected in the calibration campaign .",
    "event coordinates ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and time ( @xmath41 ) are obtained by minimizing :    @xmath42    where the index @xmath43 runs over the triggered pmts , @xmath44 is the time of arrival of the photoelectron on the @xmath45 electronic channel , and @xmath46 is the distance from the event position and the @xmath45 pmt .",
    "@xmath47 is an empirically - determined effective index of refraction to account for any other effect that is not accounted for in the reconstruction algorithm but impacts the distribution of pmt hit times , both in the optics ( e.g. rayleigh scattering ) and the electronics ( e.g. multiple photoelectron occupancy ) .    the borexino electronics records the time of each detected photoelectron introducing a dead time of 145 ns after each hit for each individual channel .",
    "therefore , the timing distribution is biased at high energy , where multiple photoelectrons are detected by each channel , and the position reconstruction is energy dependent . to measure this effect",
    ", we deployed the @xmath24am@xmath25be neutron source at the six cardinal points of the sphere defining the fiducial volume , _",

    "the recoiled proton from neutron scattering allows us to study the reconstructed position as function of the collected charge up to @xmath105000 p.e .. figure  [ fig : recon ] shows the ratio of measured versus nominal position of the @xmath24am@xmath25be source .",
    "this data was used to define the fiducial volume @xmath48@xmath493 m .",
    "the non - homogeneous distribution of live pmts , in particular the large deficit of live pmts in the bottom hemisphere @xcite , is responsible for the different spatial response at mirrored positions about the @xmath20-@xmath21 plane .",

    "the spatial resolution is expected to scale as @xmath50 where @xmath33 is the number of triggered pmts , and this was confirmed by determining the  spatial resolution to be 41@xmath46 cm ( 1@xmath9 ) at 140kev  @xcite .",
    "systematic deviations of reconstructed positions from the nominal source position are due to the 3.5 cm accuracy of the ccd cameras in the determination of the calibration source position , and in 1.6 cm introduced by the energy dependency .",
    "the overall systematics are within 3.8 cm throughout the 3m - radius fiducial volume .",
    "we report our results for the rate of electron scattering above 3mev from  neutrino interactions in the active target .",
    "we also report the result above the threshold of 5mev , to facilitate the comparison with results reported by sno  @xcite and superkamiokande phase - i  @xcite at the same threshold .",
    "this energy range is unaffected by the scintillator intrinsic background , since the light quenching effect reduces the visible energy of  ( @xmath15=5.001mev ) from @xmath51th contamination in the scintillator below the energy threshold of 5mev .",
    "the analysis in this paper is based on 488  live days of data acquisition , between july 15 , 2007 and august 23 , 2009 , with a target mass of 100 t , defined by a fiducial volume cut of radius 3 m .",
    "the total exposure , after applying all the analysis cuts listed in the next section , is 345.3 days .",
    "the cosmic muon rate at lngs is 1.16@xmath40.03m@xmath52hr@xmath8 with an average energy of 320@xmath53gev  @xcite . each day ,",
    "@xmath104300  muons deposit energy in borexino s inner detector . depending on deposited energy and track length",
    ", there is a small but non - zero chance that a cosmic muon induces a number of photoelectrons comparable to the multi - mev electron scatterings of interest for this analysis , and is mistaken for a point - like scintillation event .",
    "a measurement of the neutrino interaction rate in borexino requires high performance rejection of muon events and an accurate estimate of the muon tagging efficiency .    as mentioned earlier , the borexino wt is instrumented with 208 pmts to serve as a muon veto .",
    "if an inner detector ( i d ) event coincides in time with an outer detector ( od ) trigger ( i.e. more than 6  pmts in the wt are hit within a 150ns window ) , the event is tagged as muon and rejected .",
    "however , the od efficiency is not unity and depends on the direction of the incoming cosmic muon .",
    "in addition , we perform pulse - shape discrimination on the hit time distribution of inner detector pmts , since for track - like events , like muons , such distribution generally extends to longer times than for point - like events , like @xmath23-decays and @xmath54 scattering .",
    "we exclude muons from the event sample in the energy range of interest ( 3.016.3mev , or 14136743p.e . ) by imposing the following requirements ( i d cuts ) :        the efficiency of the selection cuts was evaluated on a sample of 2,170,207  events , identified by the od as muons .",
    "only 22 of these events , a fraction of ( 1.0@xmath40.2)@xmath55 , survive the i d cuts in the energy and spatial region of interest , and are tagged as possible scintillation events .",
    "we do not have an absolute value for the od muon veto efficiency , but we estimate it to be larger than 99% , from g4bx  simulations .",
    "the residual muon rate , due to the combined inefficiency of the two tagging systems , taking into account the fact that the two detectors are independent , is muons / day/100 t , or muons / day/100 t above 5mev .",
