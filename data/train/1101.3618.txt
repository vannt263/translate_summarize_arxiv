    "spin glass ( sg ) state is an archetype of ordered states in random magnets where the ferromagnetic ( positive ) and antiferromagnetic ( negative ) spin - spin interactions are randomly distributed .",
    "the strong frustration due to the random distribution of the interaction produces a complicated magnetic ordered state , where the spins are frozen with random orientations , showing striking glassy behaviors such as the long - time relaxation , aging phenomenon , memory effect , and chaos effect @xcite .",
    "although extensive investigations of the sg have been done since its discovery , many unresolved problems remains .",
    "one of them is whether the replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) predicted by the mean - field theory @xcite occurs in real sg materials .",

    "the rsb sg state has a complicated multi - valley structure of its free - energy @xcite and is an essentially different state from rs states such as paramagnetic and ( anti)ferromagnetic states , where simple one- and two - valley structures , respectively .",

    ", the sg state has a simple two - valley structure of its free energy as well as in an ( anti)ferromagnetic state .",
    "the rsb and rs sg states can be distinguished by examination of stability of the sg phase under finite magnetic field .",
    "the rsb sg state is stable in the presence of finite magnetic field @xcite , whereas the droplet rs sg state is unstable in any magnetic field @xcite .",
    "many numerical and experimental investigations were performed to examine the stability of the sg under magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the experiments of two different model sg materials , fe@xmath5mn@xmath1tio@xmath6   @xcite and dy@xmath5y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2   @xcite , are worthy of attention .",
