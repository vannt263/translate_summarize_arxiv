    "brane - world models of the universe allow us to explore the cosmological implications of extra - dimensional gravity . in these models ,",
    "matter is confined to a four - dimensional  brane \" while the gravitational field propagates in a higher - dimensional  bulk \" spacetime .",
    "of particular interest are the randall - sundrum ( rs ) type cosmological models  @xcite , with one extra spatial dimension that is infinite . at low energies",
    "the 5d graviton is localized at the brane , because of the strong curvature of the bulk due to a negative bulk cosmological constant , and general relativity is recovered with small corrections . at high energies , gravity behaves as a 5d field and there are large deviations from general relativity .",
    "the effective 4d planck scale on the brane , @xmath1gev , can be much higher than the true 5d planck scale @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the background rs - type cosmology is a schwarzschild - anti de sitter ( ads ) bulk with a friedman - robertson - walker brane that is moving away from the black hole as the universe expands .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath4 of the bulk black hole produces a coulomb effect at the brane .",
    "this coulomb effect is felt on the brane as a  dark radiation \" term @xmath5 in the modified friedman equation on the brane .",
    "one of the corrections to the background model that can be considered , is to incorporate the production of 5d gravitons in particle interactions  @xcite .",
    "this can become significant at very high energies .",
    "the gravitons are emitted into the bulk and feed the black hole , so that @xmath6 . at low energies the effect is negligible and @xmath4 asymptotes to a constant value .",
    "the general problem is highly complicated , but a simplified model can be constructed by neglecting the back - reaction of the gravitons on the bulk geometry , and by assuming that all gravitons are emitted radially  @xcite ( some progress in the case with non - radial emission has been made  @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a vaidya - ads bulk ( previously considered as a model for thermodynamic interactions between the brane and the black hole  @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical equations for the simple radiating brane - world may be solved exactly  @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass grows monotonically and tends to a late - time constant .",
    "an expanding brane is always outside the black hole horizon  @xcite .",
    "here we consider a further generalization of the radiating brane - world model , by allowing for asymmetry in the bulk , i.e. , different cosmological constants and initial black hole masses on either side of the brane . such asymmetry has been previously investigated for non - radiating brane - worlds  @xcite .",
    "( the equations for the completely general case are derived in  @xcite . )",
    "we find that for radiating brane - worlds , the introduction of asymmetry leads to some interesting new features , in addition to those already identified previously for non - radiating models .",
    "the bulk metric is vaidya - anti de sitter  @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8const are plane - fronted null rays which are ingoing for @xmath9 and outgoing for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the bulk cosmological constant , and @xmath4 is the mass parameter of the black hole at @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the brane is outside the horizon ( @xmath14 ) , which requires negative @xmath12 for non - negative @xmath4 .",
    "the metric is a solution of the bulk field equations @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and the bulk stress tensor has null - radiation form , @xmath17 here @xmath18 gives the power density in the null radiation that flows along the null rays generated by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the field equations require that @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is cosmic proper time on the brane .",
    "the brane trajectory is @xmath24 , and we have taken the brane to be spatially flat . the ray vector has been normalized so that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the brane 4-velocity . from @xmath27",
    "we obtain @xmath28 up to this point everything applies for either side of the brane , i.e. for @xmath29 .    at high energies on the brane , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the brane tension ,",
    "particle interactions produce gravitons that escape into the bulk . assuming that all such gravitons are emitted radially , and that we can neglect their back - reaction on the bulk geometry",

    "the function @xmath18 is determined in the radiation era ( @xmath32 ) by kinetic theory arguments as  @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a small dimensionless constant .",
    "because of graviton emission , the brane energy is not conserved , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hubble rate .",
    "the radiation leaving the brane is the same on both sides of the brane , but the different curvature on either side affects the propagation of the radiation .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 describe where the radiation is going : @xmath38 indicates radiation into the black hole , @xmath39 indicates radiation to infinity",
    ". there are four cases :    * for @xmath40 , the brane radiates into black holes on either side of the brane .",
    "* for @xmath41 , the radiation is escaping to infinity on both sides of the brane .",
    "* for the remaining two cases , with @xmath42 , radiation falls into a black hole on one side and escapes to infinity on the other .",
    "note that in the non - radiating case ( @xmath43 ) , there are also four cases with the above values of @xmath44 , with @xmath38 denoting the half - bulk that includes the black hole ( or that includes the ads cauchy horizons in the case @xmath45 ) , while @xmath39 denotes the half - bulk on the other side of the brane .",
    "these four cases show important differences in the relation between the brane energy density and the bulk geometry .",
    "the key equation is eq .",

    "it is not possible to have radiation escaping to infinity on both sides without having negative total energy density on the brane .",
    "this negativity also holds in the non - radiating case and in the @xmath0-symmetric case ; it is not the asymmetry or the radiation escaping that causes the problem , but the fact that the bulk curvature is decreasing as one moves away from the brane",

    "the projected field equations on the brane  @xcite show that the effective gravitational constant is @xmath63 we also fine - tune the cosmological constant on the brane to zero , @xmath64      in the symmetric case we recover the equations of  @xcite .",

    "for the general asymmetric case , we define dimensionless quantities as follows : @xmath71 the first four variables are the same as those used in  @xcite , while @xmath72 and the parameter @xmath73 encode the asymmetry .",

    "the first three graphs show the effect of increasing @xmath73 while keeping @xmath79 fixed .",
    "the effect on the scale factor is to introduce acceleration at late time .",

    "figure  [ epsilondmgraph ] shows that even if there is no initial difference in the black hole mass functions on either side of the brane , and given that the radiation from the brane is symmetric , a difference in the mass functions will still develop during the evolution , because of the different curvatures on either side of the brane .",
    "figures  [ dma36graph ] and [ dmm36graph ] demonstrate the effect of varying @xmath79 for a fixed @xmath73 .",

    "there are four cases , depending on whether the radiation falls into a black hole or escapes to infinity on either side of the brane .",
    "we performed numerical integrations of the equations in the case where radiation feeds black holes on both sides of the brane .",
