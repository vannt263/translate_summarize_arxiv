    "this type of resonance , the disk vertical motions play a critical role .",
    "at such a resonance , a planet forcing frequency component matches the free oscillation frequency of a vertically displaced fluid element that behaves adiabatically . like the lindblad case , there are infinitely many such resonances , one for each azimuthal wavenumber @xmath4 .",
    "but since the free vertical oscillation frequency varies with height above the disk midplane , these resonances do not occur at particular radii as in the lindblad case . instead they lie along tilted planes .",

    "we disregard the stellar rotation and set @xmath214 . the tidal forcing frequency due to the companion star is @xmath205 .",
    "we then have that @xmath215 radial wave propagation is possible ( i.e. , @xmath216 ) in the radiative outer layers of a star outside the buoyancy resonance where @xmath217 ( cf . equation ( 15 ) of @xcite with @xmath218 ) .",
    "waves can be launched at the resonance where @xmath219 because the long wavelength of the wave @xmath220 can match the spatial scale of the slowly varying tidal field .",
    "the effects of rotation modify the dispersion relation by changing @xmath221 in the denominator on the right - hand side of equation ( [ drs ] ) to @xmath222 .",
    "therefore , one major difference between the disk case investigated here and stellar case is due to the effects of rapid rotation , @xmath202 , in the low frequency disk case .",
    "consider possibility that r modes are launched at buoyancy resonances in disks .",
    "waves are launched at resonances if there is a strong overlap between the spatial form of the wave with that of the forcing .",
    "typically that occurs at wave turning points where the long wavelength form of the wave matches the form of the relatively slowly varying potential .",
    "for example , from equation ( [ dr ] ) , @xmath223 is small near a lindblad resonance where @xmath224 .",
    "this locally long wavelength permits a strong coupling with the tidal potential that results in the excitation of a wave .",
    "although vertical wave turning points for r modes lie on the buoyancy resonance plane ( @xmath225 at @xmath226 in equation ( [ dr ] ) ) , the radial wavenumbers @xmath223 are large , as follows from equation ( 58 ) of @xcite with dimensionless frequency @xmath227 for @xmath228 .",
    "( note : @xcite used the term g modes for what are r modes , see also @xcite . )",
    "the r mode becomes more confined vertically as it approaches corotation .",
    "its vertical wavenumber @xmath210 at the midplane and radial wavenumber @xmath223 both grow to very large values near corotation ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , the r mode structure may not generally match the spatial form of the potential along the buoyancy resonance .",
    "this lack of matching may explain why r modes are not excited at buoyancy resonances .",
    "differential equation ( [ peq1 ] ) , which we obtained for the pressure perturbation near a buoyancy resonance in the constant gravity case , is consistent with dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) . in that case",
    ", @xmath30 is constant , @xmath229 ( see equation ( [ psf ] ) ) , and near the buoyancy resonance @xmath230 .",

    "@xcite determined the structure of the disk modes by using what could be called the `` waveguide '' model . in that model ,",
    "the amplitude variations in the @xmath8 direction are assumed to occur slowly compared to phase variations . for perturbations induced by the buoyancy resonance , that assumption does not apply .",
    "for the case of vertically varying gravity , amplitude variations along both the @xmath8 and @xmath10 directions are rapid and comparable .",
    "the interaction between a planet and a disk that responds adiabatically can be understood qualitatively in terms of a 3d impulse delivered to the gas as it passes by the vicinity of the planet @xcite .",
    "the impulse generates a wake whose density is affected by the buoyancy of the gas .",
    "the wake in turn causes a planet - disk torque .    to understand the physical nature of the response of the gas",
    ", we have examined its nonaxisymmetric response to a potential that has a single azimuthal wavenumber @xmath4 .",
    "we analyzed the role of buoyancy resonances in a disk whose unperturbed vertical structure is isothermal and is subject to adiabatic perturbations .",
    "a vertically displaced fluid element undergoes vertical free oscillations at the buoyancy frequency @xmath30 .",
    "although the gravitational forcing we have adopted was simplified to be purely azimuthal , this forcing induces nonaxisymmetric vertical pressure and buoyancy forces with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath4 that are stationary in the frame of the potential .",
    "fluid elements move azimuthally through this vertical force field at velocity @xmath233 due to the disk shear .",
    "the vertical forcing frequency on the fluid elements is then @xmath234 a buoyancy resonance occurs where the absolute values of the free ( @xmath30 ) and forcing frequencies ( @xmath235 ) match , as given by equation ( [ xres ] ) .",
    "the resonance leads to a nonaxisymmetric density response that contains a contribution that is out of phase with respect to the potential and results in a torque .    to carry out the analysis , we first considered the case of a disk with constant vertical gravity that is subject to a simple perturbing potential given by equation ( [ eq : phic ] ) .",
    "the resonance in this case lies along a plane that is perpendicular to the disk plane , at some @xmath47 ( independent of @xmath10 ) given by equation ( [ xres ] ) .",
    "we obtained an analytic linear description of the structure of the resonance .",

    "this result confirms the existence of the buoyancy torque found in simulations by zhu et al ( 2012 ) .",
    "the pressure perturbation is everywhere smooth , but singular behavior occurs in its second radial derivative that leads to a contribution to the torque ( figs .",

    "the width of the torque region is controlled by damping processes and not gas pressure .",
    "the resonance does not result in radially or vertically propagating waves .",
    "we then considered the case of variable vertical gravity with the same simple perturbing potential .",
    "unlike the case of disk resonances previously studied , the buoyancy resonances in this case lie on tilted planes @xmath236 .",
    "we obtained an analytic formula for the torque density , equation ( [ t1 ] ) that agrees well with numerical calculations ( see fig .",

    "the buoyancy resonance exerts a torque over a region that lies radially closer to the corotation radius than the lindblad resonance .",

    "they do not result in vertically or horizontally propagating waves .",
    "their width is not determined by the gas sound speed , but instead by damping .",
    "the current analysis has several limitations that could be overcome in future studies .",
    "the potential was taken to be of a very simple form in order to investigate the existence and basic analytic properties of a buoyancy resonance . but a more realistic potential would provide a more accurate description in a linearized model .",
    "the analysis presented here assumed that the gas behaves adiabatically .",
    "the radiative transfer of heat between the resonant region and its surroundings can reduce the buoyancy force on perturbed gas and so weaken the resonance for sufficiently low values of the disk optical depth .",
    "in addition , this heat exchange plays a role in determining the resonance width .",
    "since the torque is confined to a thin layer , the resonance may saturate ( weaken ) by feedback effects that may act to change the local disk structure .",
    "such effects can not be studied by linear theory .",
    "the analysis thus far has been limited to shearing boxes .",
    "the shearing box does not describe the corotation resonance and its possible interaction with the buoyancy resonance .",
    "the effects of the buoyancy torque on the net migration rate and in particular its direction ( inwards or outwards ) depend on a competition between the inner and outer buoyancy torques that in turn depends on gradients of disk parameters .",
