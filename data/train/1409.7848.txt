    "the dense polymer model is the first member @xmath11 of the yang - baxter integrable series of logarithmic minimal models . in the scaling limit , the central charge is @xmath12 and the conformal weights yield the kac formula for the infinitely extended kac table @xcite .",

    "they solved the inverse identity for different boundary conditions , including the case in which noncontractible loops are allowed .",
    "the structure of the inversion identity dictates its solvability at fugacity 2 of the non - contractible loops .",
    "the fixed fugacity prevents the evaluation of the free energy as a function of fugacity , so the average number of loops on the cylinder remains unknown . at the same time , the statistics of noncontractible loops is important as it is related to the conformal properties of the model in the continuous limit .",
    "the standard tool for determination of the central charge @xmath13 of a conformal field theory , corresponding to a given lattice model at the critical point , is the @xmath14 expansion of the free energy of an infinitely long cylinder of finite perimeter @xmath4 .",
    "the two leading terms of the expansion have the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bulk density of the free energy per unit length , and @xmath17 is an effective central charge , which is a combination of the true central charge @xmath13 and a correction term depending on the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it will be shown below , that the contribution of the non - contractible loops in @xmath18 is of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore @xmath17 depends on the presence of such loops and their fugacity in the case of two - dimensional lattice models , and on a twist parameter in the corresponding quantum chains .    in this paper , we solve the model of dense polymers on the cylinder by calculating the partition function of a spanning web model on a finite cylinder in the presence of cycles winding around the cylinder .",
    "our aim is to evaluate the grand partition function of the dense polymers model at arbitrary fugacity of the non - contractible loops and to find their density per unit height of the cylinder .    for an infinite cylinder of perimeter @xmath4",

    "( [ 2.11 ] ) is dimensionless , we expect it to be universal .",
    "a second quantity of interest is the density of noncontractible loops : @xmath52 notice that the density of noncontractible loops is proportional to the current density ( a physical explanation of this observation is still missing ) .",
    "we observe also that the dependence on @xmath7 in @xmath0 has a very simple form .",
    "there is a simple way to check if the probability distribution of noncontractible loops is gaussian or not .",

    "( [ 2.5 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) one can can compute all the moments @xmath53 of the probability distribution .",

    "for the same case ( @xmath56 ) only , one has a simple expression for the ground state energy valid for any value of @xmath4 : @xmath60 using this relation , one can compute the density of noncontractible loops for any fugacity and any size of the system @xmath4 .",
    "another representation of the @xmath0 model relates loop configurations to clusters of bonds on sublattices of the original lattice .",
    "the square lattice of sites with integer coordinates can be divided into two sublattices , black and white . for sites of the black sublattice",
    "the sum of coordinates is even , while for sites of the white one it is odd .",
    "the bijection between loop and bond configurations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - bijection ] .",
    "the neighboring sites of each sublattice are connected by a bond if it does not intersect the borderlines of the elementary cell .",
    "each connected cluster of bonds in the bulk of the lattice is situated inside a loop .",
    "each bulk cluster on the black sublattice is surrounded by a connected cluster of bonds on the white sublattice and vice versa .",

    "[ fig - loops].,width=302 ]    at @xmath2 , the absence of bulk loops contractible to a point implies the absence of isolated clusters of bonds on the black or white sublattice .",
    "the allowed bond configurations are the so called spanning webs , i.e. , the graphs containing all vertices of a sublattice , noncontractible loops arising from the periodic boundary conditions and spanning trees connected either to open boundaries or to the noncontractible loops .",
    "clearly , due to the bijection between bonds and elementary cells , the presence of every noncontractible loop in the bulk of the cylinder is equivalent to the presence of a pair of noncontractible polymers in the dense polymer representation .",
    "if there are no noncontractible loops in the system , polymers can propagate from the top to the bottom of the cylinder .",
    "these polymers are treated as defect lines that separate clusters of bonds one from another .",
    "the reformulation of the dense polymer model in terms of bond configurations leads us to the standard problem of spanning graphs on the square lattice .",
    "the cycle - free spanning graphs are called spanning trees ; the graphs containing a number of cycles are called spanning webs . the enumeration of spanning trees is traced back to the classical kirchhoff theorem @xcite .",
    "the spanning web model appears in statistical mechanics as the temperley representation @xcite of the dimer model solved by kasteleyn @xcite and by temperley and fisher @xcite .",
    "a particular case we consider here is the spanning web model on a cylinder with noncontractible cycles supplied by fugacity @xmath1 .",
    "this decoration needs a generalization of the kirchhoff theorem .",
    "a similar model , considered as the ( 1,2 ) logarithmic minimal model , has been solved in @xcite , where the fugacity of noncontractible loops was first introduced .",
    "a basic accent of the present work is the calculation of the density of noncontractible cycles in a finite geometry .",
    "we consider an oriented labeled graph @xmath61 with vertex set @xmath62 and set of bonds @xmath63 .",
    "vertices are the sites of a finite square lattice rotated by @xmath64 and wrapped on a cylinder . the graph @xmath61 can be considered as a sublattice of square superlattice @xmath65 with standard orientation , containing @xmath3 rows and @xmath4 columns of cells .",

    "[ superlattice ] as open and filled circles .",
    "the vertex set @xmath62 is the sublattice of filled circles .        for convenience ,",

    "are chosen to be even .",
    "the vertex set @xmath62 of the rotated square lattice @xmath71 then consists of the vertices of the sublattice of @xmath65 with , say , an even sum of the horizontal and vertical coordinates , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath73 the edges in @xmath63 we take oriented from a site @xmath74 to its nearest neighbors on the right - hand side , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we call this direction `` positive '' , and the opposite one , from a site @xmath74 to its nearest neighbors on the left - hand side , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we call `` negative ''",
    ".    we find it convenient to analyze the construction of spanning web configurations on the above oriented graph by using the arrow representation ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "accordingly , to each vertex @xmath79 we attach an arrow directed along one of the bonds @xmath80 incident to it .",
    "each arrow defines a directed bond @xmath81 and each configuration of arrows @xmath82 on @xmath71 defines a spanning directed graph ( digraph ) @xmath83 with set of bonds @xmath84 depending on @xmath82 .",
    "a cycle of length @xmath85 is a sequence of directed bonds @xmath86,@xmath87 , @xmath88 , where all @xmath89 , @xmath90 are distinct . if both @xmath81 and @xmath91 belong to the same spanning web we say that it contains a cycle of length 2 .",
    "our aim is to study sets of spanning digraphs with no other cycles than those which wrap the cylinder .",
    "the relevant configurations will be enumerated with the aid of a generating function defined as the determinant of an appropriately constructed weight matrix : @xmath92 in this respect , the derivation of the above relationship , see the appendix , is merely a generalization of the matrix kirchhoff theorem @xcite .",

    "note that all closed paths which do not wrap the cylinder contain an equal number of edges with either orientations , hence their weight in @xmath104 remains the same as in @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , all the configurations that contain such closed paths ( contractible cycles ) cancel out in the expansion of @xmath106 . on the other hand , cycles generated by off - diagonal elements that wrap",
    "the cylinder change their sign , because they contain edges oriented in one direction exceeding by @xmath4 the number of edges in the opposite direction .",
    "this amounts to the total factor of @xmath107 or @xmath108 depending on the orientation .",
    "therefore , each noncontractible cycle with a given orientation is counted twice , however , with different weight  once it enters into the determinant expansion with the unit weight , being generated by diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath109 , and second time it enters with a factor @xmath110 or @xmath111 ( depending on the orientation ) as generated by off - diagonal elements of that matrix .",
    "thus , the total number of noncontractible cycles , irrespective of their origin and orientation , is given by the coefficient in front of the corresponding power of @xmath112 in the series expansion of the partition function .",
    "in general , besides the noncontractible cycles , the average number of which is controlled by fugacity @xmath1 , the spanning digraph contains tree subgraphs connected to the cycles .",
    "all branches of the trees can be generated only by the diagonal elements of @xmath109 and , hence , carry unit weight .",
    "to calculate the generating function @xmath113 in expression ( [ zd ] ) , we make some initial transformations that allow us to easily diagonalize the matrix @xmath114 .",
    "first of all , the decomposition ( [ v ] ) of the vertex set @xmath62 of the rotated square lattice @xmath71 suggests its rearrangement by combining all pairs of nearest neighbors @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 into two - site unit cells .",
    "thus we obtain a square @xmath119 array of @xmath120 unit cells with the connectivity of a triangular lattice . under neglect of the boundary effects at the top and bottom of the cylinder",
    ", we describe the weighted connectivity of the sites in a unit cell with their neighbors in @xmath71 , taking into account the bond orientation , by introducing the following @xmath121 matrices : @xmath122 @xmath123    now the matrix @xmath114 , see eq .",

    "the leibnitz formula expresses the determinant of @xmath189 as a sum over all permutations @xmath194 of the set @xmath195 : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the symmetric group and @xmath198 is the signature of the permutation @xmath194 .",
    "the identity permutation @xmath199 in eq .",
    "( [ leibniz ] ) yields the term @xmath200 equal to the number of all possible arrow configurations on @xmath71 .",
    "in general , each permutation @xmath201 can be factored into a product ( composition ) of disjoint cyclic permutations , say @xmath202 .",
    "this representation partitions the set of vertices @xmath62 into non - empty disjoint subsets  the orbits @xmath203 of the corresponding cycles @xmath204 , @xmath205 . more precisely , if @xmath206 is the orbit of @xmath204 , then @xmath207 and @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the cardinality of the orbit @xmath203 , or equivalently , the length of the cycle @xmath204 .",
    "the orbits consisting of just one element , if any , constitute the set @xmath210 of fixed points of the permutation : @xmath211 . in the case of the identity permutation @xmath212 ,",
    "all orbits consist of exactly one element , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .",
    "a cycle @xmath204 of length @xmath216 will be called a _",
    "proper cycle_. a proper cycle of length 2 corresponds to two oppositely directed edges that connect a pair of adjacent vertices : @xmath217 , @xmath218 .",
    "note that the vertices of an orbit @xmath203 of cardinality @xmath219 are connected by a closed path on @xmath71 which can be traversed in two opposite directions : if @xmath204 is the cycle defined by @xmath220 , then the reverse cycle @xmath221 can be represented as @xmath222 .",
    "now we take into account that the proper cycles on @xmath71 are of even length only , hence the signature of every permutation in the expansion of the determinant depends on the number of proper cycles in its factorization , i.e. , if @xmath223 , where @xmath224 , @xmath225 , then @xmath226 .",
    "thus , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ leibniz ] ) can be rearranged according to the number @xmath227 of disjoint proper cycles as follows : _",
    "i=1^n z_i + _ p=1^[n/2 ] ( -1)^p _ = c_1 c_p _ i=1^p _ v_i , c_i(v_i ) _",
    "c_i(v_i),c_i^2(v_i)_c_i^l_i -1(v_i),v_i_js_fp()z_j .",
    "[ altern ] here @xmath228 is the @xmath85-fold composition of the cyclic permutation @xmath204 of even length @xmath209 , @xmath229 , so that @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "note that all nonvanishing off - diagonal elements are equal to @xmath232 .",
    "the above expansion reveals the following features : ( i ) as expected , all spanning digraphs on @xmath71 have at least one proper cycle ; ( ii ) each term with @xmath233 represents a set of @xmath234 distinct spanning digraphs , which have in common the specified cycles @xmath235 , and they differ in the oriented edges outgoing from the vertices @xmath236 .",
    "these oriented edges may form cycles on their own which do not enter into the list @xmath235 ; ( iii ) since the sets @xmath237 and @xmath238 are disjoint , the proper cycles formed by the oriented edges incident to the fixed points of a given permutation @xmath239 should enter into the enlarged list of cycles @xmath240 , @xmath241 , corresponding to the cycle decomposition of another permutation @xmath242 .",
    "for example , consider the determinant of the laplacian matrix of a cylinder of height 3 and perimeter 6 shown in fig .",
    "[ example ] .",
    "the set of vertices @xmath62 consists of filled circles marked by @xmath243 .",
    "the set of oriented edges is a collection of 24 inclined vectors of type @xmath244 .",
    "the corresponding leibnitz expansion contains the term @xmath245 which represents @xmath246 spanning digraphs on @xmath71 with 2 specified cycles and all possible oriented bonds outgoing from the vertices 3,8 and 9 .    as noticed first in ref .",
    "@xcite , the expansion ( [ altern ] ) parallels in form the _ inclusion - exclusion principle _ in combinatorial mathematics .",
    "indeed , let @xmath247 be the list of all possible proper cycles on @xmath71 , labeled in an arbitrary order .",
    "define @xmath248 , @xmath249 as the set of all spanning digraphs on @xmath71 containing the particular cycle @xmath204 .",
    "then , expansion ( [ altern ] ) can be written in the form of the inclusion - exclusion principle : @xmath250 which holds for any finite sets @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the cardinality of the set @xmath253 .",
    "this sum equals zero , because all spanning digraphs on @xmath71 have at least one proper cycle @xmath204 , @xmath254 . the first term of the expansion originates from the term @xmath255 in eq .",
    "( [ altern ] ) and represents the set of all possible cycles formed by oriented edges incident to every vertex of @xmath71 . to obtain the number of spanning webs",
    ", one has to subtract all the digraphs having contractible cycles and leave all those with noncontractible cycles wrapping the cylinder . to keep the number of noncontractible cycles",
    ", we have to change the weights of the nondiagonal terms in such a way that every cycle containing difference between the numbers of positive and negative steps equal to @xmath256 or @xmath257 , depending on the orientation , enters the determinant expansion with the opposite sign and sums up with the corresponding non - contractible cycle , generated by the arrows representing the diagonal term @xmath255 . at that ,",
    "all the proper contractible cycles keep their sign in the expansion ( [ altern ] ) in order to cancel out .",
    "this readily follows from the fact that every contractible cycle contains equal numbers of positive and negative steps .",
    "thus , the matrix @xmath95 with elements given by ( refelementsd ) has all the necessary properties for the relationship ( [ zd ] ) to define the proper generating function .",
