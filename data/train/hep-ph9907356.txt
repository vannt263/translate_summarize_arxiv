    "the function @xmath37 , interpretable as the difference in production probabilities of unpolarized hadrons from a transversely polarized quark depending on transverse momentum , is allowed because of the non - applicability of time reversal invariance .",
    "this is natural for the fragmentation functions because of the appearance of out - states @xmath43 in the definition of @xmath44 , in contrast to the plane wave states appearing in @xmath45 .",

    "after the analysis of the soft parts , the next step is to find out how one obtains the information on the various correlation functions from experiments , in this particular case in lepton - hadron scattering via one - photon exchange as discussed before . to get the leading order result for semi - inclusive scattering it is sufficient to compute the diagram in fig .",

    "the most well - known results for leptoproduction are : the indices attached to the cross section refer to polarization of lepton ( o is unpolarized , l is longitudinally polarized ) and hadron ( o is unpolarized , l is longitudinally polarized , t is transversely polarized ) .",
    "note that the result is a weighted sum over quarks and antiquarks involving the charge @xmath51 squared . comparing with",
    "well - known formal expansions of the cross section in terms of structure functions one can simply identify these . for instance",
    "the above result for unpolarized scattering ( oo ) shows that after averaging over azimuthal angles , only one structure function survives if we work at order @xmath52 and at leading order in @xmath15 .",
    "it is well - known that in 1-particle inclusive unpolarized leptoproduction in principle four structures appear , two of them containing azimuthal dependence of the form @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the first one only appears at order @xmath15  @xcite , the second one even at leading order but only in the case of the existence of nonvanishing t - odd distribution functions . to be specific if we define weighted cross section such as d^2q_t ( 2_h^ ) _",
    "oo we obtain the following asymmetry .",
    "an interesting asymmetry involving the same fragmentation part is a @xmath55 single spin asymmetry , requiring only a polarized lepton but no polarization for the target  @xcite .",
    "this cross section involves , besides the time - reversal odd fragmentation function @xmath37 , the distribution function @xmath56 .",
    "the tilde function that appear in the cross sections is in fact the socalled interaction dependent part of the twist three functions .",
    "it would vanish in any naive parton model calculation in which cross sections are obtained by folding electron - parton cross sections with parton densities . considering the relation for @xmath57 one can state it as @xmath58 = @xmath59 in the absence of quark - quark - gluon correlations .",
    "the inclusion of the latter also requires diagrams dressed with gluons .    for polarized targets ,",
    "several azimuthal asymmetries arise already at leading order .",
    "for example the following possibilities were investigated in refs  @xcite .",
    "the latter two are single spin asymmetries involving the fragmentation function @xmath60 .",
    "the last one was the asymmetry proposed by collins  @xcite as a way to access the transverse spin distribution function @xmath61 in pion production .",
    "note , however , that in using the azimuthal dependence one needs to be very careful .",
    "for instance , besides the @xmath62 , one also finds at leading order a @xmath63 asymmetry which is proportional to @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "notice that an estimate of the function @xmath65 can be obtained from inclusive results for @xmath66 using the relation  [ gtrel ] for @xmath67 .",
    "actually this relation is exact and the data from the slac e143 experiment were used for an estimate in ref .",
    "an update using the preliminary @xmath66 data from the e155 experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ g1tupdat ] .",
    "more about the final analysis of these data will be reported in ref .",
    "a well - known approximation for @xmath66 is the wandzura - wilczek result  @xcite .",
    "an alternative derivation of this relation is obtained by combining the separation of the twist three function @xmath68 into a twist - two part and an interaction dependent part @xmath69 , omitting quark mass terms given by g_t(x ) = + g_t(x ) . by eliminating @xmath65 one",
    "then derives the relation g_t(x ) = _ x^1 dy + _",
    "the wandzura - wilczek part is obtained by putting @xmath70 . within this approximation",
    "one can find an estimate for @xmath65 from the @xmath71-data , the result of which using the smc data  @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ g1tupdat ] .    in the same experiment in which one would measure the single spin asymmetry @xmath62 , one can also measure the possible existence of a @xmath72 asymmetry .",
    "such an asymmetry would arise from a t - odd distribution function ; to be precise by comparing the results for  [ finalstate ] and [ initialstate ] , leptoproduction could resolve an ambiguity in the explanation of the single spin ( left - right ) asymmetry observed in @xmath73 , which can be attributed to a t - odd effect in the initial state ( sivers effect , @xmath74  @xcite ) or a t - odd effect in the final state ( collins effect , @xmath60  @xcite ) .",
    "estimates for the leptoproduction asymmetries for both cases have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and are found to have quite characteristic behavior as a function of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    as a final example",
    ", we want to concentrate on single spin asymmetries @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , for which preliminary results have been presented  @xcite by the hermes collaboration .",
    "the results for two of these have been mentioned already ( eqs  [ as1 ] and [ as2 ] ) , the other one is actually a higher twist result  @xcite , in the same way as discussed for @xmath68 and @xmath65 , we also have relations between the @xmath35-functions .",
    "one can combine the decomposition of the function @xmath80 , appearing at subleading order in leptoproduction , into a twist - two part and an interaction dependent part ( omitting quark mass dependent terms ) , h_l(x ) = -2 + h_l(x ) , with eq .",
    "[ hlrel ] to eliminate @xmath27 and find h_l(x ) = 2x_x^1 dy + _ |h_l .",
    "the approximation @xmath81 e.g. can be used to obtain an idea of the magnitude of @xmath80 and then with the exact eq .",
    "[ hlrel ] an estimate for @xmath27 .",
    "one needs as input some reasonable guess for @xmath61 ( e.g. in our case we took @xmath61 = @xmath42 up to some spin factors ) to get the estimate in fig .",
    "[ h1lperp1 ] .",
    "we find that the functions @xmath65 and @xmath27 are of the same order of magnitude , and about an order of magnitude smaller than the functions @xmath42 and @xmath71 . with the presented estimates and the estimate for @xmath82 from ref .",
    "@xcite which not only determines the functions @xmath83 ( eq .  [ frag1 ] ) but also @xmath84 , h(z ) = -2zh_1^(1)(z ) + h(z ) , we find for the single spin asymmetries the results in figs  [ ws1 ] and [ ws2 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath78 asymmetry is larger than the @xmath79 asymmetry .",
    "this shows e.g. that the absence in the hermes results of a clear signal for the second asymmetry does not allow conclusions on the magnitude of @xmath27 .",
    "in the previous section some results for 1-particle inclusive lepton - hadron scattering have been presented .",
    "several other effects are important in these cross sections , such as target fragmentation , the inclusion of gluons in the calculation to obtain color - gauge invariant definitions of the correlation functions and an electromagnetically gauge invariant result at order @xmath15 , and finally qcd corrections which can be moved back and forth between hard and soft parts , leading to the scale dependence of the soft parts and the dglap equations .    in this contribution",
    "we have tried to indicate why semi - inclusive , in particular 1-particle inclusive lepton - hadron scattering , can be important .",
    "the goal is the study of the quark and gluon structure of hadrons , emphasizing the dependence on transverse momenta of quarks .",
    "the reason why this prospect is promising is the existence of a field theoretical framework that allows a clean study involving well - defined hadronic matrix elements .",
    "it does require , however , also a dedicated experimental effort using polarized beams , targets and detection of final state hadrons .    99 d.e .",
