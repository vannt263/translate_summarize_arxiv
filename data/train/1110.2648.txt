    "[ introduction ]    the photometric and dynamical properties of the elliptical galaxies could be explained by multivariate analysis which reveals the fundamental scaling relations of these galaxies .",
    "one of the most well - known manifolds showing a tight correlation between @xmath4 ( i.e. the radius encompassing half - light of the galaxy ) , @xmath5 ( i.e. the mean surface brightness within @xmath4 in flux unit ) , and @xmath6 ( i.e. the galaxy internal velocity dispersion ) , is the fundamental plane ( hereafter fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; faber et al . 1987 , dressler et al . 1987 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in theory ,",
    "the fp is derived from the virial theorem as @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is the effective surface brightness in flux units , calculated within the half - light radius , @xmath4 , of the galaxy , @xmath6 is the galaxy internal velocity dispersion and @xmath3 is its mass - to - light ratio .",
    "assuming that the @xmath3 is expressed by a power - law function of @xmath6 and/or the effective surface brightness , @xmath5 , the fp relation is simplified as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the mean surface brightness in @xmath10 unit and is defined as @xmath11 .",
    "although the shape of the fp and its coefficients differs for different gravitationally bound systems from globular clusters ( burstein et al . 1997 ) to galaxy clusters ( schaeffer et al . 1993",
    "; fritsch & buchert 1999 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "2006a : zgz06 ) , there is no doubt about its existence ( lucey , bower & ellis 1991 and its references ) . in reality , the coefficients of the fp relation differ from the prediction of the virial theorem .",
    "the observed coefficients are a=1.24 and b=0.33 ( jrgensen , franks and kjrgaard 1996 : jfk96 ) while the virial theorem predicts a=2.0 and b=0.4 .",
    "this difference , often referred to as the  tilt \" of the fp , is mainly attributed to different formation histories and evolutionary processes .    .",
    "the blue dashed line is the best linear regression between the two parameters .",

    "width=302 ]    the difference in fp coefficients of different spheroidal systems with different mass , size and luminosities , can be explained by evolution of the @xmath3 ratio as a function of stellar population [ age , metalicity or initial mass function ( imf ) ] and/or dark matter content ( tortora et al .",
    "2009 ; grillo & gobat 2010 ; graves & faber 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , the absence of homology , i.e , the fact that , the structure of spheroids is scalable regardless of their size , can be the source of the fp tilt ( donofrio et al .",
    "2008 ; trujillo , burkert & bell 2004 ) . on the other hand , some authors studied the role of dissipation in explaining the nature of the fp ( ribeiro & dantas 2010 ; hopkins , thoms & hernquist 2008 : hch08 ) .",

    "( 2008 ) have found a strong correlation between the fp coefficients and the local cluster environment and no strong correlations with internal galaxy properties ( e.g. sersic index and galaxy colour ) . moreover , fp coefficients are independent of global properties of clusters such as radius , x - ray luminosity and cluster velocity dispersion ( donofrio et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "on the other hand , while reda , forbes & hau ( 2005 ) have shown that isolated early - type galaxies lie on the same fundamental plane as galaxies in high - density environments , cluster galaxies have also less intrinsic scatter in their properties compared to field galaxies ( de carvalho & djorgovski , 1992 ) .

    "this mechanism has been invoked also to explain the shape of the low mass dwarf galaxies and their mass profiles ( snchez - janssen et al .",
    "2010 ; governato et al .",
    "differences between the fp of giant and dwarf galaxies have been known for some time ( nieto et al . 1990 ; bender et al .",
    "1992 ; guzman et al .",
    "peterson & caldwell ( 1993 ) , studying a sample of nucleated dwarfs , they found a change in @xmath3 ratio with luminosity as predicted by the scaling relations of ds86 .",
    "the study of 17 virgo dwarfs ( -17.5@xmath15 - 15.48 ) by geha et al .",
    "( 2002 & 2003 ) placed des on a plane parallel to , but offset , from that occupied by normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , graham & guzmn ( 2003 ) , based on a detailed surface photometry from hst archival images for a sample of des in the coma cluster , claimed that the e - de dichotomy is a consequence of a continuously varying profile shape with galaxy luminosity .",
    "they attributed the e - de dichotomy to the fact that the light profile of dwarf galaxies do not follow the de vaucouleurs law ( 1948 ) and therefore , concluded that giant and dwarf ellipticals ( hereafter des ) were not formed by different mechanisms . however , as found by geha et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , modelling the des with srsic functions ( 1968 ) does not explain why des lie on a different region of the fp . although it is clear that dwarf ellipticals do not lie on the fundamental plane as defined by brighter ellipticals ( geha et al . 2003 ) , zaritsky et al .",
    "( 2006 a , b ) showed that the differences between the `` fundamental planes '' , defined by different families of spheroids from dwarf ellipticals to galaxy clusters , is the result of a non - linear relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "desroches et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also found the sensitivity of the coefficient a of the fp to the luminosity faint - end cutoff .",
    "donofrio et al .",
    "( 2008 ) were among the first to question the universality of fp and proposed the bending of fp of early - type galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , fraix - burnet et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied a sample of galaxies with the redshift range 0.007 - 0.053 , and found that the global fp is a mixture of several fundamental planes , with different thickness and orientations , and concluded that the fp is not a bent surface .",
    "they found seven groups of fundamental planes which are assigned to different galaxy assembly histories and formation scenarios .",
    "another fundamental scaling relation , based on pure photometric observables , was introduced by khosroshahi et al ( 2000 a , b ) , called the photometric plane ( hereafter php ) of the galaxies . the srsic index in the php , which replaces the velocity dispersion in fp , carries information on the light profile in galaxies and it is correlated with the dynamical properties of the galaxies such as the total mass and internal stellar velocity dispersion ( graham 2002 : gr02 ) .",
    "steeper the light profile at the centre of the galaxy ( higher srsic index ) , more massive the galaxy and larger the central velocity dispersion .",
    "fp and php could be potentially used to derive distance to any single galaxy .",
    "gr02 has compared both photometric and fundamental planes for exactly the same sample of early - type galaxies in virgo and fornax clusters , and concluded that the scatter about the php is @xmath115 - 30% more than the scatter about fp .",
    "since the php is purely based on photometric quantities , it can be replaced with fp wherever the expensive kinematic data are not available and/or high level of accuracy is not required .    in paper i in this series ( kourkchi et al .",
    "2011a ) we used the high spectral resolution of deimos ( faber et al .",
    "2003 ) on the keck ii telescope to measure precise velocity dispersions for a sample of 41 faint elliptical galaxies in coma cluster . of this sample ,",
    "28 galaxies lie in the observed footprints of the hst / acs coma treasury survey ( carter et al .",

    "we add a further 43 galaxies with velocity dispersions from matkovi & guzmn ( 2005 : mg05 ) or cody et al .",
    "( 2009 : co09 ) , which also lie in these footprints , giving us a combined sample of 71 objects with @xmath18 with precise velocity dispersions measured from one of these sources .",
    "we noticed that fainter dwarfs show a departure from brighter ellipticals on the faber jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) which indicates they have higher velocity dispersion and therefore are more massive or less luminous than is predicted by l-@xmath6 linear trend .",
    "any study of the differences in the fp of dwarf and giant ellipticals helps us to test the galaxy formation scenarios . in this paper , we present the structural parameters ( effective radius , effective surface brightness , central surface brightness , srsic index and concentration parameter ) for galaxies in our sample , based on the treasury hst / acs images in the f814w and f475w filters .",
    "the precise measured structural parameters from the hst / acs images helps to examine the form of the scaling relations at faint luminosity and low surface brightness , and to investigate how the coma dwarfs fit onto the well - known fundamental plane .",
    "in addition , we study the scatter of faint des about the fundamental plane of giant ellipticals and examine whether it depends upon photometric and structural parameters of galaxies , such as srsic index , luminosity and colour .",

    "comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) , which are based on acs f814w and f475w - band photometry , we find the same behaviour of @xmath3 ratio in different wavebands .",
    "we noted that , the ( @xmath3)-@xmath41 relation of galaxies fainter than @xmath40 is also independent of the passband .",
    "therefore , the stellar population is not the only parameter responsible for the change of @xmath3 ratios ( mo99 ) .    as a conclusion",
    ", we found that the @xmath3 ratio is not constant over all of our sample des and varies with the mass and the luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "the variation in @xmath3 ratio is responsible for the deviation of our fainter des from the fp .",
    "since the fainter galaxies in our sample are bluer than the other galaxies and have larger @xmath3 ratios , we attribute their deviation from the fp to their recent star formation activities ( see also  [ sec : devcol ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we studied the fundamental and photometric planes of a sample of 71 des in the core of coma cluster , the nearest massive elliptical - rich cluster down to luminosity of @xmath62 . taking advantage of the deimos high resolution spectrograph , which enables us to measure the internal velocity dispersion of dwarf ellipticals , and high resolution imaging of hst / acs which allows an accurate surface brightness modelling , we were able to extend the fp of galaxies to @xmath11 magnitude fainter than the previous studies .",
    "we obtained the fp for a subsample of 12 galaxies brighter than @xmath63 as @xmath64 which is consistent with the previous studies of bright galaxies in coma ( jfk96 ; mo99 ) .",
    "studying the fp of 141 early - type galaxies in the shapley super cluster at @xmath65=0.049 , gargiulo et al .",
    "( 2009 : ga09 ) found that the fp follows the relation @xmath66 for galaxies with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "when including all galaxies in their sample , including low - mass galaxies down to @xmath6950 @xmath70 , ga09 found a shallower exponent for @xmath6 .",
    "the fp relation of our des displays even shallower exponents for @xmath6 and @xmath71 than in ga09 , due to further extension to fainter galaxies .    in figures [ fig : fphotp ] and [ fig : deviation ] , the faintest galaxies and the most deviant data points are based on our deimos observations .",
    "one could argue that our @xmath6 measurements might be overestimated . in paper",
    "i , we have considered all source of uncertainties in measuring the velocity dispersions , namely the statistical errors , template mismatch and other systematic uncertainties .",
    "we have also checked the sensitivity of our measured velocity dispersions to different kind of stellar templates . moreover , using different set of mixed stellar templates , covering a vast range of spectral types , when measuring the velocity dispersions , confirmed our measurements .",
    "the presented uncertainty in the measurement includes all such sources and therefore we can rule out the overestimation argument .    in this study ,",
    "the spectroscopy was carried out using the slits with the size of 0.7 arcsec covering the body and the central region of the galaxies . due to the size of slits , for galaxies with net rotation ,",
    "the measured velocity dispersion differs from the central velocity dispersion .",
    "the kinetic energy per unit mass ( ke ) for a spheroid is ( e.g. busarello , lango & feoli 1992 ) :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the rotation velocity , @xmath74 is the central velocity dispersion and @xmath75 is the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "thus we have    @xmath76    the observed values of @xmath77 range from 0.01 to @xmath11.0 for galaxies with @xmath78 ( davies et al .",
    "1983 ; pedraz et al . 2002 ; simien & prugniel 2002 ; geha et al . 2003 ; van zee et al . 2004 ) , implying that the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath74 is less than @xmath115% of the central velocity dispersion .",
    "this kind of uncertainty is smaller than the total estimated uncertainty in measuring the velocity dispersions of faint des ( @xmath79 km s@xmath14 ) .",
    "based on the relation for an oblate , isotropic galaxy flattened by rotation ( davies et al .",
    "1983 ) , the mean isophotal ellipticity of four galaxies in our sample , gmp2780 , gmp2563 , gmp3119 and gmp3141 are less than 0.1 , corresponding to @xmath77 @xmath80 0.3 . using equation [ sigma ] , the uncertainty in the measured velocity dispersion due to the rotation would be @xmath12% , which is significantly smaller than the uncertainties due to template mismatch and other systematics discussed in paper i. the uncertainty due to the rotation is @xmath16% for gmp2655 and gmp2808 , for which the mean ellipticity is @xmath10.25",
    ". thus , rotation can not be solely responsible for the deviation of faint des from the faintward extrapolation of the faber - jackson relation and the fp of bright ellipticals .",
    "the non - universality of the fp is claimed by zgz06 , where they suggest that the spheroids ranging from des to the galaxy clusters lie on a curved surface , in ( @xmath6,@xmath4,@xmath9 ) space . describing the @xmath3 ratio as a parabolic function of the internal velocity dispersion",
    ", zgz06 could explain the change in the coefficients of the fp for different spherical systems .",
    "they predicted that for @xmath81 , @xmath3 is almost a flat function of @xmath6 , with a large scatter , which tends to increase for smaller values of @xmath6 . in agreement with co09 and zgz06 , we found @xmath82 for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "in addition , we found larger @xmath3 ratios for faintest des in our sample with respect to the ( @xmath3)-@xmath41 trend of brighter galaxies ( see figure [ fig : mtolratio ] ) .",
    "a mixture of formation mechanisms has been considered to model de formation . in the `` wind model '' ,",
    "des are primordial objects that lost their gas in a supernova - driven galactic wind ( ds86 ; yoshii & arimoto 1987 : ya87 ; chiosi & carraro 2002 : cc02 ) .",
    "in contrast to massive ellipticals , dwarf ellipticals have very long star formation histories .",
    "since giant galaxies hold on very strongly their gas content , their gas is almost completely converted into stars in a single burst .",
    "on the other hand , supernova activities disperse the gas and switch off further star formation in dwarf galaxies . as the gas cools , it sinks back in and again undergoes a new phase of star formation followed by supernova explosions which disperse the gas , and this cycle can be repeated many times ( bender & nieto 1990 ; de rijcke et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "an alternative formation path for dwarf galaxies involves stripping of larger galaxies by gravitational and gas dynamical processes .",
    "as galaxies fall in to the cluster they are stripped of much of their gas by ram pressure effects ( gunn & gott 1972 ; van zee , skillman & haynes 2004 ) , this process can be seen at work in both h@xmath83 and ultra - violet imaging of the coma cluster ( yagi et al .",
    "2010 ; smith et al .",
    "stars and dark matter can then be removed by interactions with more massive galaxies and the cluster potential , termed `` harassment '' ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ; moore et al 1998 ; mayer et al . 2001 ; mastropietro et al .",
    "2005 ) or by tidal encounters between galaxies of near - equal mass ( richstone 1976 ; aguerri & gonzlez - garca 2009 ) . both harassment and tidal encounters",
    "can create bars ( mastropietro et al . 2005 ; aguerri & gonzlez - garca 2009 ) which could play a part in driving gas not stripped by the ram pressure of the intergalactic medium inwards , triggering star formation .",
    "the resulting galaxy is likely to have a higher central surface brightness than its progenitor and would probably resemble a nucleated de which rotates quite rapidly and still displays some memory of its former state .",
    "although harassment tends to increase internal velocity dispersion , it is unable to disrupt rotational motion and therefore is not obviously reconciled with the low rotational velocities found by simien & prugniel ( 2002 ) , geha et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) and mg05 .",
    "another possible way to explain the formation of dwarf galaxies is presented by kroupa ( 1998 ) and duc et al .",
    "the merging process of two gas - rich disk galaxies results in many massive star clusters which coalesce to produce a small number of dwarf galaxies .",
    "these tidally formed dwarf galaxies contain negligible amounts of dark matter and hence can not explain a significant fraction of the de population .",
    "our findings appear to be most consistent with the `` wind model '' .",
    "in the wind - stripping model , the shallow potential well of dwarf galaxies , with the velocity dispersion of less than 100 km s@xmath14 does not allow intense star formation without stripping most of the gas ( schaeffer & silk 1988 ) .",
    "we found the effective radius - luminosity and faber - jackson relation as @xmath84 and @xmath85 in f814w - band , respectively .",
    "these two relations are in agreement with the calculations of de rijcke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on the winds models of ya87 and cc02 .",
    "they showed that , although , ya87 models do not predict a tight @xmath86 relation , cc02 models can reproduce it very nicely .    using the accurate measurement of the @xmath3 ratios for the sauron galaxy sample ( bacon et al .",
    "2001 ) , the fp tilt of early - type galaxies can be attributed to the variation of @xmath3 ratio which is governed by the stellar population and dark matter properties ( cappellari et al .",
    "moreover , in agreement with cappellari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , considering the resulting @xmath3 ratios based on different star formation models and mass profiles , allanson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and grillo & gobat ( 2010 ) concluded that non - homology is not a major driver of the fp tilt while the mass sensitivity of the @xmath3 ratio is the primary source of fp behaviour in different mass and luminosity regimes .",
    "we find that the fainter des are bluer , and scatter more about the fp , than the brighter ellipticals .",
    "star formation activity , together with the wind model , can explain how the bluer dwarfs at a given mass have different @xmath3 ratios and thus follow different scaling relations .",
    "the results of this study can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the fp of bright ellipticals with m@xmath87 in our sample is fully consistent with the previous studies of the coma bright galaxies .",
    "we found that the scatter about the fp depends at the faint - end luminosity cutoff is significantly increased .",
    "we noticed that the fp tilt of faint des with m@xmath88 - 20 differs from that of giant ellipticals .",
    "\\(ii ) the fp is not colour dependent which implies that the stellar population plays a insignificant role in the scatter about the fp and changing its tilt .",
    "we studied the departure of faint des from the fp of bright ellipticals , @xmath33 , which is found to be correlated with the luminosity and the galaxy brightness profile .",
    "less concentrated faint des , smaller srsic indices , show larger deviation from the fp .",
    "we also found a relation between @xmath33 and galaxies central excess light as an imprint of their formation history .",
    "in addition , we found a correlation between @xmath33 and the colour of galaxies which indicates that the bluer galaxies in our sample des display larger deviation from the fp of the bright ellipticals . on the other hand",
    ", we have already shown that in the l-@xmath6 relation , discussed in paper i , fainter des seem to be more massive ( e.g. dynamical mass estimated using the internal velocity dispersion ) than predicted from their luminosity .",
    "although tidal effects can be important in removing luminous matter from the galaxy , we believe that supernova driven winds are more probably the dominant process .",
    "\\(iii ) replacing the central velocity dispersion with the srsic index in the fp relation , we studied the photometric plane , php , of our sample galaxies . the differences in the coefficients of php relation for our des and those of previous studies in local elliptical galaxies ( gr02 ) , mainly arise from the fainter luminosity coverage of our sample .",
    "we noticed that most of the outliers in the projected php diagram have internal morphological features or poor srsic fit .",
    "our conclusion is that , while the fundamental plane is less sensitive to detailed morphology of galaxies , the photometric plane is able to effectively differentiate between different morphologies . in other words ,",
    "the scatter about the fp increases as we extend the sample to fainter dwarf galaxies . in the php , however , the scatter is driven by asymmetry and unsmooth galaxy brightness distribution .",
    "\\(iv ) we studied the correlations between the srsic index , @xmath26 , and other photometric or kinematic parameters ( i.e. @xmath35 , @xmath9 , @xmath23 , @xmath6 and the concentration ) . the light concentration and srsic index are strongly correlated with the correlation coefficient of 0.95 .",
    "the process of determining the srsic index , @xmath26 , is model dependent . on the other hand ,",
    "the concentration parameter is model independent and is determined using a simple photometric analysis .",
    "therefore , based on the @xmath26-concentration correlation , one is able to economically replace the srsic index , @xmath26 with the concentration parameter when processing the scaling relations .",
    "the best radius - luminosity relation for our sample des is obtained as @xmath84 which is consistent with the results of de rijcke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who reported a b - band radius - luminosity power - law slope between 0.28 and 0.55 for a sample of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "\\(v ) we found the kormendy relation ( kr ) slopes as 5.23@xmath320.37 and 5.17@xmath320.28 for galaxies in the luminosity ranges of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of khosroshahi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who found the kr slope as @xmath15.2 for des of 16 nearby galaxy groups with @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , in agreement with khosroshahi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we found the steeper linear trends for faint des compared to that of the brighter galaxies .",
    "\\(vi ) we obtained the mass - to - light ratio as @xmath58 for our sample des indicating that the @xmath3 ratio is almost a flat function of mass , luminosity and velocity dispersion .",
    "our finding agrees well with that of co09 , who reported a @xmath92 for a sample with nearly the same luminosity range .",
    "galaxies with @xmath49 seems to have higher @xmath3 ratios with respect to the linear extrapolation of the same associated with brighter galaxies .",
    "the variation in @xmath3 ratio is responsible for the deviation of the fainter des from the fp .",
    "since , the fainter galaxies in our sample are bluer than the other galaxies and have higher @xmath3 ratios , we attribute their deviation from the fp to their recent star formation activities .",

    "<S> we present a study of the fundamental plane , fp , for a sample of 71 dwarf galaxies in the core of coma cluster in magnitude range @xmath0 . taking advantage of high resolution deimos spectrograph on keck ii for measuring the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies and high resolution imaging of hst / acs , which allows an accurate surface brightness modeling , </S>",
    "<S> we extend the fundamental plane ( fp ) of galaxies to @xmath11 magnitude fainter luminosities than all the previous studies of the fp in coma cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , the scatter about the fp depends on the faint - end luminosity cutoff , such that the scatter increases for fainter galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the residual from the fp correlates with the galaxy colour , with bluer galaxies showing larger residuals from fp .    </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath2 in f814w - band indicating that in faint dwarf ellipticals , the @xmath3 ratio is insensitive to the mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that less massive dwarf ellipticals are bluer than their brighter counterparts , possibly indicating ongoing star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> although tidal encounters and harassment can play a part in removing stars and dark matter from the galaxy , we believe that the dominant effect will be the stellar wind associated with the star formation , which will remove material from the galaxy resulting in larger @xmath3 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the deviation of a number of faint blue dwarfs from the fp of brighter ellipticals to this effect .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study other scaling relations involving galaxy photometric properties including the photometric plane . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , compared to the fp , the scatter about the photometric plane is smaller at the faint end .    </S>",
