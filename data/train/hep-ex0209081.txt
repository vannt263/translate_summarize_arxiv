    "the internal structure of the nucleon has long been studied with inclusive deep - inelastic lepton scattering . from these studies , the spin - dependent and spin - independent nucleon structure functions and corresponding parton distribution functions",
    "have been extracted .",
    "recently , the formalism of generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) @xcite-@xcite was introduced . in this framework ,",
    "non - forward degrees of freedom are probed in exclusive processes such as meson production or deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , the electroproduction of a single real photon on the nucleon , which has been studied at desy @xcite-@xcite and jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "this opens the way to access the distribution of partons in the nucleon perpendicular to its momentum @xcite , and to access the contribution of the orbital angular momenta of the quarks to the nucleon spin @xcite .",

    "the final state is indistinguishable from that of the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process , in which the real photon is radiated off the lepton .",
    "the bh process constitutes a background to the dvcs process .",
    "since it is purely electromagnetic , its amplitude can be calculated exactly .",
    "this contribution is subtracted from the combined dvcs+bh data by means of a monte carlo simulation that is cross checked with a bh - dominated sample of the experimental data @xcite .",

    "[ fig : h1q2 ] and [ fig : h1w ] , was measured in the 1997 running period with an 820  gev proton energy .",
    "the sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 8  pb@xmath5 .",
    "the data cover a kinematic range in four - momentum transfer squared @xmath1 from 2 to 20  gev@xmath2 , invariant mass of the photon - nucleon system @xmath3 from 30 to 120  gev and the square of the momentum transfer to the proton @xmath6@xmath01  gev@xmath2 , over which the cross section is integrated .",

    "the exponential @xmath7-dependence factorizes from the @xmath1 and @xmath3 dependences .",
    "since the @xmath7-dependence of the cross section was not measured , upper and lower bounds are determined by taking values of the @xmath7-slope parameter @xmath8 of 5 and 9  gev@xmath9 .",
    "a newer gpd - based approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "the zeus results are based on data taken between 1996 and 2000 , and , for the first time , also make use of the hera electron beam .",
    "the integrated luminosities are 95  pb@xmath5 for @xmath10 and 17  pb@xmath5 for @xmath11 collisions .",
    "the data were analyzed in the kinematical region defined by 5@xmath0@xmath1@xmath0100  gev@xmath2 and 40@xmath0@xmath3@xmath0140  gev , with no cut on @xmath7 .",
    "the data were found to agree for both lepton charges .",
    "the @xmath12 data shown in figs .  [ fig : zeus - q2 ] and [ fig : zeus - w ] are scaled to central values of @xmath3 = 89  gev and @xmath1 = 9.6  gev@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the data are overlaid with theoretical predictions from the same models as the h1 data . due to the larger kinematical range and integrated luminosity ,",
    "the zeus data have enough leverage and statistical accuracy to discriminate between different theoretical predictions and can be used to constrain the predicted @xmath1 dependence of theoretical models . here , the zeus data are seen to favour the less steep slope in @xmath1 of the colour dipole model .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of the data is described well in both cases , reflecting the steep rise in gluon density at lower @xmath13 , the momentum fraction of the struck parton in the nucleon .",
    "the zeus and h1 data can not be compared directly due to the different kinematic ranges . however ,",

    "however , the dvcs and bh amplitudes interfere , giving rise to a single - spin asymmetry , which depends on beam charge , helicity , and the azimuthal angle @xmath14 between the lepton scattering plane and the reaction plane of the real photon and recoil proton . by extracting the @xmath15 and @xmath16 moments of the exclusive data",
    ", access is obtained to certain combinations of dvcs amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 moment of the beam spin asymmetry is calculated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the beam polarization for each event .",
    "the @xmath16 moment is determined similarly from the beam charge asymmetry with an unpolarized beam .",
    "the hermes forward spectrometer detects the scattered lepton and the real photon , but not the recoiling proton .",
    "therefore the exclusivity of an event is measured through the missing mass ( @xmath19 ) of the event , which in the exclusive case is equal to the proton mass .",
