    "<S> we investigate the role of long range ferromagnetic order in the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1ruo@xmath2 using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> srruo@xmath2 is a ferromagnetic metal but isostructural , isoelectronic caruo@xmath2 is an enhanced paramagnet . </S>",
    "<S> surface spectra of caruo@xmath2 exhibit temperature induced modifications . </S>",
    "<S> this is not significant in other compositions . </S>",
    "<S> this may be attributed to the structural changes observed in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the bulk spectra reveal unusual spectral changes exhibiting large decrease in the coherent feature intensity corresponding to only ferromagnetic samples , although the ru moment is very similar in all the compositions .    </S>",
    "<S> ruthenium based perovskite oxides have attracted a great deal of attention due to possibilities in significant technological applications in addition to various interesting fundamental issues . in particular , srruo@xmath2 , the only itinerant ferromagnet among the 4@xmath3 transition metal oxides ( curie temperature , t@xmath4 @xmath5 165  k ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is a promising candidate for several technological applications due to its metallic character , high magnetic moment ( 1.4 @xmath6/ru ) , high chemical stability , etc . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ultrathin films of srruo@xmath2 have already been used for normal metal layers in josephson junctions @xcite , spintronic devices based on spin polarized ferromagnetic tunnel junctions with ferromagnetic metal as an electrode @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> thus , ferromagnetic materials form basis for technological advances and microscopic understanding of the origin of such effect is crucial to design new materials for future applications .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the role of ferromagnetic transition in the electronic structure of orthorhombically distorted perovskites ( space group @xmath7 ) , sr@xmath0ca@xmath1ruo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the average ru - o - ru bond angle gradually decreases from @xmath5  165@xmath8 in srruo@xmath2 to about 150@xmath8 in caruo@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic measurements exhibit ferromagnetic ground state for @xmath9  0.8 and enhanced paramagnetic phase for higher @xmath10 values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such different magnetic ground states have also been observed in _ ab initio _ calculations based on local spin density approximations ( lsda ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various photoemission studies @xcite suggest that the electron correlation strength , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = coulomb interaction strength , @xmath13 = bandwidth ) is significantly weak and similar in all the compositions . </S>",
    "<S> transport measurements , on the other hand , indicate fermi liquid behavior in srruo@xmath2 while caruo@xmath2 is non - fermi liquid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus , clear that these systems exhibit varieties of interesting ground state properties , which can not be attributed solely to the electron correlation effect . despite numerous studies , </S>",
    "<S> the origin of such widely different ground state properties is still unclear .    in this letter , </S>",
    "<S> we report our results on the modification of the electronic structure across the magnetic phase transition in this system using state of the art high resolution photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> experimental spectra exhibit qualitatively different bulk and surface electronic structures in all the samples and interesting evolutions with the change in temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> samples were prepared by solid state reaction route followed by sintering in the pellet form for about 72 hours at 1523  k to achieve large grain size . </S>",
    "<S> sharp features in the @xmath10-ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns with lattice parameters similar to those in single crystalline samples @xcite and no signature of impurity feature indicate high quality of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> dc magnetic susceptibility , measured using high sensitivity vibrating sample magnetometer , show sharp ferromagnetic transition at 165  k in srruo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the sharpness of the transition gradually reduces and becomes insignificant for @xmath14  0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15@xmath16 for all the samples in the paramagnetic region has been estimated to be 2.8  @xmath17  0.2 @xmath15@xmath18 , which is close to the theoretical spin only value of 2.83  @xmath6 corresponding to t@xmath19 configuration of ru@xmath20 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> cleanliness of the sample surface was ensured by minimizing the higher binding energy feature in o 1@xmath23 spectra @xcite and the absence of c 1@xmath23 signal . </S>",
    "<S> a polycrystalline silver was mounted on the same sample holder in electrical contact with other samples to determine the fermi edge , @xmath24 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , we plot ru 4@xmath3 he ii spectra after subtracting the o 2@xmath25 contributions appearing at higher binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> all the spectra exhibit an intense , broad feature at 1.2  ev along with finite intensity at @xmath24 . while the intensities at @xmath24 correspond well to the band structure results ( termed as _ coherent feature _ ) , signature of the dominant contributions at 1.2  ev is not present in these results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 300  k spectra for all the values of @xmath10 are very similar exhibiting weak coherent feature intensity suggesting metallic phase in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> ru 4@xmath3 he ii spectra at 20  k exhibit significant decrease in intensity of the coherent peak , when it is normalized by the intensity at 1.2  ev of 300 k spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in intensity between the spectra at room temperature and 20  k spectra gradually increases with the increase in @xmath10 .    since , the surface contribution is significantly large ( @xmath580% ) in the he ii spectra , we probe the influence of the temperature on the ru 4@xmath3 contributions in the al @xmath22 spectra of the valence band , where the surface sensitivity is reduced to about @xmath5 40% . </S>",
    "<S> all the spectra are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) after normalizing by the intensity at 1.5  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the lineshape of the ru 4@xmath3 spectra is significantly different from the he ii spectra shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 300  k spectrum of srruo@xmath2 exhibits intense coherent peak around 0.5  ev and an asymmetry towards higher binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , corresponding 20  k spectrum exhibits significant lowering in intensity compared to the intensity at 1.5  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in coherent feature intensity is significantly large in srruo@xmath2 and becomes almost insignificant in caruo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature induced modification is strikingly different from that observed in the he ii spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this is verified in the high resolution spectra of end members shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high resolution spectra of srruo@xmath2 exhibits a large decrease in the coherent feature intensity with the decrease in temperature , while caruo@xmath2 spectra remain unchanged .    in order to understand the contrasting spectral changes in the he ii and al @xmath22 spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the surface and bulk spectral functions from these two sets of spectra at all the temperatures for all the samples . </S>",
    "<S> photoemission intensity can be expressed as @xmath26f^s(\\epsilon ) + e^{-d/\\lambda}.f^b(\\epsilon)$ ] , where @xmath3 is the thickness of the surface layer and @xmath27 is the escape depth of the photoelectrons . @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the surface and bulk spectra , respectively . using the values of @xmath30 from ref . [ 8 ] , we have extracted the surface and the bulk contributions as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the surface spectra exhibit dominant contributions at 1.2  ev binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> the threefold degeneracy of the ru 4@xmath3 @xmath31 band is already lifted in the bulk electronic structure due to the distortion of the ruo@xmath32 octahedra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of periodicity along the surface normal will further reduce the crystal symmetry from @xmath33 symmetry towards @xmath34 symmetry at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the feature at 1.2  ev is often attributed to the @xmath35 band derived from the @xmath31 band due to such symmetry breaking @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the coherent feature intensity is significantly weak in the surface spectra of all the compositions . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in temperature down to 20  k does not lead to significant change in the surface spectra of srruo@xmath2 and sr@xmath36ca@xmath37ruo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is also evident in the high resolution spectra of srruo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> small change in lineshape is observed for higher @xmath10 values , which is most significant in caruo@xmath2 exhibiting a large reduction in coherent feature intensity with the decrease in temperature as clearly visible in the high resolution spectra of caruo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> various core level studies @xcite indicate significant change in the lineshape suggesting temperature induced modification in structural parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is already clear that the two dimensional nature , defects , reconstructions at surface play key roles in determining the surface electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spectral modifications observed in the surface spectra may be attributed to such temperature induced changes of the surface structure .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , we show the bulk spectra for all the @xmath10 values . </S>",
    "<S> the room temperature spectra , normalized by integrated intensity under the curve are almost similar in all the compositions . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent peak appears at about 0.5  ev with the contribution of incoherent peak ( the lower hubbard band ) appearing at 2  ev . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the change in ru - o - ru bond angle across the series does not introduce significant change in the electronic structure of this system . </S>",
    "<S> bulk spectra at 20  k are shown in the same figure by normalizing the intensity of the incoherent feature . </S>",
    "<S> intensity of the coherent feature in srruo@xmath2 is found to decrease significantly with the decrease in temperature across the magnetic phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , such lowering in coherent features intensity is clearly visible in the bulk spectra of all the compositions exhibiting long range ferromagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra corresponding to @xmath14  0.8 remain unchanged down to the lowest temperature studied .    </S>",
    "<S> band structure calculations @xcite for various magnetic and non - magnetic solutions suggest that in the ferromagnetic ground state , the contribution from the down spin density of states moves above the fermi level due to the exchange coupling between the 4@xmath3 electronic states . since , the coherent feature represents the density of states observed in the band structure results , the lowering of coherent feature intensity across the magnetic phase transition may be attributed to the shift of down spin spectral intensity above @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this shift of the down spin density of states depends on the exchange splitting , which is also reflected in the magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to explain the change in the electronic structure in ferromagnetic compositions . </S>",
    "<S> however , various magnetic measurements suggest similar ru 4@xmath3 moment across the entire series @xcite . thus , no change in the bulk spectra of paramagnetic samples is curious and opens up an interesting question in microscopic understanding of the evolution of magnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetism is often described within two models . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the stoner description @xcite : the exchange splitting gradually decreases with the increase in temperature and becomes zero at the curie temperature leading to zero magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) on the other hand , a spin mixing behavior @xcite leads to a reduction in spin polarization with the increase in temperature keeping the magnetic moment unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the purely stoner behavior can be ruled out since the magnetic moment exists even in the paramagnetic phase in all the compositions . </S>",
    "<S> if the second case is active , the spin integrated spectra should be identical in all the compositions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , significant change only in the spectra of ferromagnetic compositions in this study is curious and opens up a _ new dimension _ in understanding ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> since , all the compounds are essentially identical except the difference in long range order , the significant modification observed in the samples having long range order naturally suggests a relation among themselves . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that in addition to the intrasite exchange interactions ( responsible for local magnetic moments ) , intersite exchange correlations , which give rise to long range order presumably play a key role in determining the spectral functions observed by photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we hope , this study will help to initiate further efforts in this direction to understand this effect in ferromagnetic materials .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the change in the electronic structure across the magnetic phase transition in a series of compounds exhibiting magnetic ground states ranging from ferromagnetic to enhanced paramagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> although the intrasite exchange interactions are similar in all the compositions , the bulk spectra exhibit significant modification in the lineshape across the curie temperature in ferromagnetic materials , while the spectra in paramagnetic samples remain unchanged down to the lowest temperature studied . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that intersite exchange interactions responsible for long range order presumably play an important role in determining the electronic structure of these interesting materials .    99    j. j. randall and r. ward , j. amer . chem . </S>",
