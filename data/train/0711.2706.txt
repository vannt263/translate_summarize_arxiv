    "the cantor set complementary to the devil s staircase associated with the circle map has a fractal dimension @xmath0 [ jensen et al . , 1984 ] ,",
    "universal for a wide range of maps [ bak , 1986 ] , such results being of a numerical character . in this paper",
    "we deduce a formula for such dimensional value , the corresponding theoretical reasoning permits conjecturing on the nature of its universality .",
    "a cantor or devil s staircase is an increasing function @xmath11 from @xmath12 $ ] onto @xmath1 , with zero derivative almost everywhere , constant in the so - called intervals of resonance or stability @xmath13 , @xmath14 , which are infinite in number .",
    "such staircases are frequently observed in empirical physics [ bak , 1986 ] , and their universal properties are of great interest .",
    "the complement in @xmath1 of @xmath15 is a totally discontinuous cantor - dust set @xmath3 naturally associated with the staircase , which reflects the features of the particular physical problem under study .",
    "the sine circle map @xmath16 is a simple model describing [ bak , 1986 ] systems with two competing frequencies , e.g. the forced pendulum , with @xmath17 the angle formed by the vertical and the pendulum , @xmath18 the discretized time variable , and @xmath19 the frequency of the system in the absence of the non - linear term given by the sine function .",
    "let @xmath20 be the winding number of the system .",
    "the graph of the function @xmath21 is a well known cantor staircase ; with @xmath22 we denote an interval of stability as well as the corresponding stair step .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be two such resonance intervals such that all intervals between these two have smaller length .",
    "let @xmath25 if @xmath26 , @xmath27 if @xmath28 , all stair steps have rational height .",
    "if @xmath29 is in the largest interval in the gap between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then @xmath30 ; i.e. the height of stair steps follows what , by definition , is the farey - brocot @xmath2 interpolation law .",
    "this is so for many staircases empirically found in physics and other sciences . starting from @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath6 interpolates @xmath33 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , partitioning @xmath1 in two intervals , in turn partitioned in two intervals each , yielding a partition of @xmath1 in @xmath36 intervals in the second order interpolation  and in @xmath37 intervals in the @xmath38 order of the @xmath6 interpolation .",
    "the induced @xmath6 measure in level @xmath39 of interpolation gives the same probability measure by definitioni.e .",
    "@xmath40 , to each of these @xmath37 intervals .",
    "let @xmath41 be such that @xmath42 is the stair step of height @xmath43 , and @xmath43 is every rational in the @xmath38 level of @xmath6 interpolation .",
    "then @xmath44 is a covering of @xmath3 by @xmath37 intervals @xmath45 in the horizontal @xmath19 axis , such that @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the @xmath37 intervals of the @xmath6 partition of @xmath1 in the vertical @xmath48 axis .",
    "if we plot [ piacquadio , 2004 ] lengths of the @xmath37 intervals @xmath49 against length of the corresponding @xmath46 we obtain a straight line that passes through the origin with slope @xmath50 growing as @xmath39 grows .",
    "so @xmath3 also follows the hierarchy of the farey tree via its covering : the staircase relates an @xmath6 structured unit segment @xmath1 ( dimension @xmath35 ) with an @xmath6 structured subset @xmath3 ( dimension @xmath51 ) of @xmath1 , i.e. the staircase selects a subset of @xmath1 of smaller dimension , the @xmath6 partition being at the core of the very structure of the staircase .",
    "hence , it seems natural to relate the @xmath6 partition to the @xmath52 value : using the tools of multifractality , we calculate the multifractal spectrum @xmath53 of the @xmath6 measure on @xmath1 , and identify which subfractal @xmath54 has a dimension @xmath52 .",
    "we find that @xmath8 is the set that concentrates the @xmath6 measure , it corresponds to the value @xmath55 for which @xmath56 and @xmath57 , i.e. its dimension @xmath52 is the entropic or information dimension of the @xmath6 measure .",
    "a feature in the importance of this dimensional value is its universality , which has been checked ( again [ bak , 1986 ] ) by studying a broad class of circle maps with more complicated non - linear terms than the simple sine map .",
    "although details may differ from those of the sine map @xmath58 steps narrower , sometimes largerstill the dimension of the underlying @xmath3 remains @xmath52 .",
    "we proceed as follows : the @xmath37 intervals in the @xmath38 @xmath6 partition have the same @xmath6 measure , @xmath40 , but very different lengths , i.e. very different euclidean measure .",
    "we start ( secs . 3 and 4 ) with the thermodynamical algorithm @xmath53 for the hereinafter called euclidean case , and by this",
    "we mean : all segments considered have equal euclidean length at any @xmath38 partition .",
    "we proceed from there in slow steps in such a way that the results can be extended to the @xmath6 measure ( sec .",
    "5 ) in a manner that we trustwill be seen as `` natural '' .",
    "thus , a first connection between the two measures will be established : working always in @xmath1 , we express @xmath55 and @xmath59 in terms of contractors ( probability contractions @xmath60 and/or length contractions @xmath61 ) and their key frequencies linked to each other through the thermodynamical algorithm ; a finite number of contractors for the so - called euclidean case , extending the results to an infinite number of contractors in the @xmath6 case .",
    "next , we estimate ( sec .",
    "5.5 ) the hausdorff dimension of the subfractal @xmath8 for which @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the @xmath6 measure , and we obtain the entropic or information dimension of the measure to be @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which yields the value @xmath65 in the interval defined by @xmath66 ( again bak 1986 ) , the universal constant associated with the dynamics of the circle map which is why we conjecture that said dynamics inherits , via the @xmath6 structured staircase , this universal constant , which is an inherent property of the @xmath6 measure .",
    "finally , by taking averages over the very different lengths of intervals in nth @xmath6 partitions , as @xmath39 grows , we obtain a statistical @xmath6 contractor ( sec .",
    "7 ) with which we can calculate the dimensionally _ euclidean _ ( having only one contractor , all segments have equal euclidean length at any nth partition ) , statistically self - similiar , fractal version of the @xmath6 partition",
    ". such process , briefly described in sec .",
    "7 yields again the universal value @xmath52 ( sec . 8) , which is a second and much deeper connection between the two measures .",
    "the definition of the @xmath6 measure on @xmath1 as constant over intervals in nth partitions is not an arbitrary one : there is a non - euclidean geometry on the upper half - plane , the @xmath6 partition is its inheritance on @xmath1 .",
    "this geometry ( we briefly comment on it in sec . 9 ) has an associated regular tiling which partitions the real line in @xmath6 interpolations , and the location of the tiles approaching a real irrational number `` _ _ i _ _ '' describes by naked - eye direct observationits decomposition in continued fractions , which yields , as we will see , the location of `` _ _ i _ _ '' in the multifractal spectrum of the @xmath6 measure .",
    "note : sec .",
    "6 can be by - passed by the reader : there are old and new results on the @xmath53 spectrum of the @xmath6 measure , and in sec . 6",
    "we `` harmonize '' the only apparentcorresponding discrepancies .",
    "note : although the math level in this paper does not go beyond finding extremes of a function of several variables , the reader un - interested in long and tedious and tiresome estimates , approximations , and calculations can proceed to sec .",
    "2 : generalities and notations , then go to sec . 7 and therefrom to sec . 9 : geometrical considerations , conclusions and conjectures .",
    "important note : by necessity we work , from sec . 3 to sec . 8 , sometimes with approximations `` @xmath67 '' , sometimes with exact equalities `` @xmath68 '' ,",
    "so the corresponding calculations yield estimates , and make no claim to be rigorous proofs of formal theorems .",
    "with @xmath69 we will denote probabilities , @xmath70 will be frequencies , @xmath71 contractors , @xmath72 will be a normalizing sum `` ( a different one for each normalizing process ) ; @xmath73 and @xmath74 the coefficients of the lagrange method of indeterminate coefficients for finding extremes of functions . with @xmath75",

    "the farey - brocot tree interpolates rational @xmath80 between rationals @xmath81 and @xmath82 , starting from @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the extremes of the unit interval . the first interpolation has , therefore , two segments @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86,\\dots$ ] the nth step of interpolation partitions the unit segment in @xmath37 segments .",

    "let us recall that @xmath59 is , theoretically , the hausdorff dimension of the subfractal @xmath103 which contains all elements with the same @xmath55-concentration ; and that the @xmath55-concentration of a segment is the log - log version of the density : @xmath104 @xmath105 the length of the segment and @xmath106 its probability measure .",
    "point @xmath55-concentration is defined in the same way as point density : from @xmath55-concentration of segments containing the point and a limiting process .",
    "first we consider the unit segment as partitioned in two segments of equal euclidean length when @xmath107,  and in @xmath37 euclidean equal parts in step @xmath39 .",
    "the first two segments have probability measures @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 , so @xmath69 , @xmath111 are contractions .",

    "we can write then @xmath123 for this magnitude .",

    "as variable @xmath134 varies , the @xmath53 graph is drawn .",
    "we call @xmath135 an internal '' coordinate , because in a certain step @xmath39 , @xmath121 tells us the value of @xmath118 , the number of times in which @xmath106 appears , that is the proportion @xmath136 of all segments with measure @xmath137 .",
    "henceforth , we will be interested in the subfractal for which @xmath133 and @xmath138 , in all cases and in all measures considered .",
