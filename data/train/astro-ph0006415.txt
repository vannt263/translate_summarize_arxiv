    "the synthesis telescope at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) is a radio telescope with unique capabilities for galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) studies .",
    "operating simultaneously at the frequency of the spin - flip spectral line of atomic hydrogen ( the line near 1420mhz ) , and in two continuum bands near 1420mhz and 408mhz , the telescope achieves arcminute angular resolution with exceptional sensitivity to extended structure over wide fields ( 3.12at 1420mhz and 9.63  at 408mhz at the 10% level ) .",
    "these features allow it to map several major constituents of the ism , namely the atomic gas ( through the line ) , the ionized gas ( thermal continuum emission detected in the continuum bands ) , and the relativistic component ( which generates synchrotron emission , measured in the continuum bands ) in a way which few other telescopes can match .",
    "its principal project at the time of writing is the canadian galactic plane survey ( @xcite ) ; data from this survey are now entering the public domain . the purpose of this paper is to acquaint the scientific community with the characteristics of the telescope .",
    "the telescope in its original form was described by roger et  al.(@xcite ) , with the first astronomical results being published shortly thereafter ( @xcite ; roger & costain 1976 ) . over the following two decades the capabilities of the telescope were enhanced through a series of modifications , including increasing the number of antennas from 2 to 4 and doubling the maximum baseline in 1982 , adding a 408mhz continuum channel in 1984 , and adding a second receiver path to the 1420mhz continuum system in 1986 to allow both hands of circular polarization ( cp ) to be measured .",
    "an extensive rebuilding of the telescope began in 1992 , to create a telescope optimized for studies of the galactic ism , concentrating on high angular resolution , wide - field studies of .",
    "enhancements over the following 3 years included the addition of three antennas , a new 1420mhz continuum correlator with double the reception bandwidth and polarimetry capabilities , and a new spectrometer with double the number of channels .",
    "the result is a substantially new telescope , built on the basic infrastructure of the old . in this paper",
    "we describe the telescope , with emphasis on its new components .",
    "the telescope was conceived as a tool for the study of the galactic , which is known to have structure on all angular scales at which observations have been attempted , from tens of degrees ( @xcite ) to tens of milli - arcseconds ( @xcite ) .",
    "an angular resolution of 1 arcmin was the target , an order of magnitude improvement over the resolution available with the largest single - antenna radiotelescopes , while retaining sensitivity to intermediate and larger structures .",
    "this required a finely sampled aperture plane and short interferometer baselines , which in turn dictated the use of small antennas .",
    "it was also clear at the outset that it would be necessary to incorporate single - antenna data into the synthesis telescope images ( see  2.3 ) and to mosaic individual images together to extend the field of view .",
    "a telescope which can successfully image emission will also be suitable for imaging galactic continuum emission , which similarly displays a wide range of structural sizes .",
    "continuum emission at decimetre wavelengths originates in the ionized and relativistic components of the ism .",
    "the latter gives rise to a small percentage of linear polarization in the emission , and the ability to measure polarization was included in the telescope to give information on magnetic fields at the point of origin and on the magneto - ionic medium along the line of sight .    with only seven antennas ,",
    "the number of instantaneous baselines is just 21 ; many more baselines are required to meet the desired imaging criteria .",
    "the chosen configuration was therefore an east - west aperture synthesis telescope with movable elements .",
    "earth rotation varies the baseline vector during an observation , and the movable antennas are relocated until the required set of baselines has been completely sampled in consecutive observations .",
    "( the normal observing strategy for the telescope is described in  8) .",
    "the task of designing an array configuration to meet the above objectives was constrained by the existing four - antenna array , which had two movable antennas on 300 m of rail , along with two fixed antennas , one at the west end of the rail and one @xmath5 m to the east . with the possibility of adding only three additional antennas , the final configuration ( figure  1 ) was dictated by the needs of both continuum and -line imaging described above .",
    "the diameter of the antennas used in the array is 8.5 m ( for further details see  3 ) .",
    "the baseline increment is @xmath6 m , about half an antenna diameter .",
    "this provides the necessary fine baseline sampling , and places the first grating response at an angular radius where the primary beam of the antennas is at a very low level , so that grating responses to objects within the usable field of view lie outside the field ( although responses to strong sources outside the usable field can still appear within it ) .",
    "antenna shadowing and the risk of mechanical interference limit the minimum usable baseline to @xmath7 m , which is sufficient to allow full representation in the images of structures as large as 40  arcmin at 1420mhz and 2.3  at 408mhz . a maximum baseline of @xmath8 m provides the desired 1-arcmin resolution limit at 1420mhz ( at 408mhz a resolution of 3.4  arcmin is achieved ) .",
    "table  1 lists the telescope specifications .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     calibration of the spectrometer is difficult because the narrow channel bandwidth leads to high noise levels in individual channels .",
    "calibration is achieved in a two - step process , by using calibration coefficients measured in the continuum bands . at the point",
    "where if signals enter the central telescope building , a broadband noise signal can be injected into all if paths , at a level sufficient to produce a correlation coefficient of @xmath9 , adequate to give an accurate measurement of gain and phase in each spectrometer channel in 15 minutes .",
    "the continuum calibration measures antenna - based gain and phase which vary relatively slowly with frequency , but may vary with time . the if calibration measures mostly the channel - to - channel amplitude and phase differences , which arise largely in the filters which define the bandpass , just before the signals are digitized ; these are quite stable with time . this if calibration is performed once every 4 days .    in later stages of image processing , amplitude and phase corrections",
    "are determined for individual antennas from self - calibration of stokes @xmath10 images .",
    "these corrections are also applied to polarimeter images . under some circumstances it is beneficial to apply them to images ( _ e.g.",
    "_ when there is a strong continuum source in the field ) .",
    "the antennas are capable of tracking down to an elevation of 12 , so the observable sky from the observatory s terrestrial latitude of 49nominally extends from declination @xmath11  to + 89 ( the latter imposed by the telescope drive system ) . however , full hour - angle coverage is possible only for declinations north of + 18 .",
    "sources north of declination + 54  are circumpolar , and there is an overlap in hour - angle coverage at lower culmination , making it possible to track a circumpolar source for 26 sidereal hours without interruption .",
    "non - sidereal tracking rates are available for observing solar - system objects .",
    "since they are equatorially mounted , the antennas track only in hour angle , although pointing corrections are made in both hour angle and declination . a pointing model for each antenna accounts for zero offset and ellipticity of the position encoders , misalignment of the polar axis , and non - orthogonality of the declination and hour - angle axes .",
    "these parameters are empirically determined from `` nodding '' observations of selected calibrators at many hour angles and declinations .",
    "a `` nod '' consists of measurements on - source and at 4 off - source positions situated 1north , south , east , and west of the source , to which two - dimensional gaussians are fitted to obtain errors in hour angle and declination .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "pointing accuracy across the observable sky is @xmath12 in r.a .  and @xmath13 in dec .",
    "for a given observation , the pointing corrections at the declination of interest are calculated from the pointing model for every 30 minutes of hour angle , and interpolated linearly to intermediate hour angles .",
    "the tracking accuracy is then determined by a feedback loop in the control system , which measures the deviation of the antenna position from the requested position ; at present errors in antenna position exceeding @xmath14 are corrected .",
    "such corrections typically occur on timescales of 30 minutes .",
    "the synthesized beam of the synthesis telescope depends on the taper applied in the _ u - v _ plane ; details of synthesized beams are given in table  6 . a uniform weighting is always applied when making images from the telescope . the objectives of research with this telescope usually benefit more from better sensitivity and lower sidelobe levels than from high spatial resolution , so a gaussian taper falling to 20% at @xmath15 is typically applied to the _ u - v _ plane .",

    "the half - power beamwidth of the antennas is @xmath25 at 1420mhz and @xmath26 at 408mhz , but experience has shown that the usable field of view extends at least to the 10% level of the respective primary beams ( diameters of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) .",
    "empirical measurements show that these beams are well approximated by a function of the form @xmath29 . if @xmath30 is the radius in degrees , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "precise knowledge of the beam function is required for accurate mosaicing of images of individual fields .",
    "wide - field imaging is an important aspect of the synthesis telescope , so off - axis effects must be carefully considered .",
    "the continuum bands at 1420mhz span 35mhz , and , owing to differential delay effects , if the entire band were assumed to be at the nominal centre frequency there would be a reduction in point - source sensitivity of approximately 50% at a radius of @xmath33 . this would be accompanied by a radial smearing of a point source to approximately twice the nominal beamwidth ; while this preserves total flux , it is clearly unacceptable for high - fidelity imaging .    by treating the four 7.5mhz continuum bands separately during imaging , taking into account the actual centre frequency of each ,",
    "the reduction in point source sensitivity at @xmath33 is only 5% , with a comparable amount of source distortion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the 3.5-mhz bandwidth at 408mhz reduces the point - source sensitivity by about 10% at a radius of @xmath34 , again with a similar amount of source distortion .",
    "effects due to time averaging are also a factor . at the radii of @xmath33 at 1420mhz and @xmath34 at 408mhz , the visibility averaging period of 90s",
    "reduces point - source sensitivity by about 8% in a 12-hour observation , with source distortion of similar magnitude in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the combined effect of bandwidth and time - averaging smearing is then a worst - case reduction of point - source sensitivity of about 13% at 1420mhz and 17% at 408mhz , with both radial and azimuthal distortions .",
    "software written for analyzing synthesis telescope images takes these effects into account when determining , for example , point - source fluxes .",

    "artefacts , which are very difficult to remove by normal processing , rise above the thermal noise limit when telescope pointing is closer than 3  to cas a or cyg a. at 408 mhz , the dynamic range achieved is about @xmath70 , for offsets greater than 5  from strong sources .",
    "owing to the thorough sampling of baselines in a @xmath71  hour observation set , the images produced by the synthesis telescope have very low sidelobe levels and excellent sensitivity to extended structure .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure  7 , which shows part of the data from one 1420-mhz field from the canadian galactic plane survey .",
    "the extended object which dominates stokes @xmath10 images of this field is the region w5 ( ic  1848 ) , in the perseus arm of the galaxy at a distance of @xmath72kpc .",

    "the raw stokes @xmath74 image ( lower left ) shows structure on many scales , totally unrelated to that seen in the @xmath10 image .",

    "we have described a synthesis telescope uniquely suited to observation of the galactic ism . while its resolution ( @xmath75 ) is modest compared to some synthesis telescopes ( _ e.g. _ the vla ) , its sensitivity to extended structure is superior , and it offers significantly different performance from single - antenna telescopes . in this section we discuss a few examples of results obtained with the telescope , chosen to illustrate its unique capabilities . a more detailed discussion will be found in taylor et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    at distances of 2 to 10kpc",
    ", the @xmath0 angular resolution of the telescope translates into a physical resolution of 0.6 to 3pc , which has proved to be a good match to significant ism structures .",
    "the interstellar shows extensive filamentary structure on these scales both within the galactic plane ( @xcite ) and at high latitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the origin of the fine structure in this emission is not completely understood , it seems very often to be related to interfaces between the atomic phase and some other constituent of the ism , or to energy injection , as from stellar winds .",
    "experience with the telescope has shown that there are significant ism phenomena which extend over many degrees , but require arcminute angular resolution for their detection .",
    "an example is provided by the discovery of a galactic chimney by normandeau et  al .",
    "this structure is a conduit for radiation and material from the disk to the halo , and it is outlined by a sharp interface between the exterior and the ionized interior .",
    "its size is @xmath76 , equivalent to several hundred pc at the distance of the perseus arm ( @xmath72kpc ) .",
    "it is nevertheless extremely difficult to detect in the survey data of hartmann & burton ( 1997 ) : even though that survey has much higher nominal sensitivity than the synthesis telescope , its angular resolution is only @xmath77 .",
    "similar considerations apply to the detection of thermal and non - thermal continuum objects .",
    "the continuum sensitivity of the telescope ( listed in table  7 ) translates into sensitivity to thermal emission measure ( at both frequencies ) of @xmath78@xmath79pc and sensitivity to synchrotron emission of @xmath80wm@xmath36hz@xmath37sr@xmath37 , also at both frequencies .",
    "an example is provided by the detection of large supernova remnants ( snrs ) of low surface brightness .",
    "for example , @xcite discovered the snr g65.1 + 0.6 , whose size is @xmath81 .",
    "the overall surface brightness of this object is about half of the nominal rms sensitivity quoted above , indicating the importance of filamentary structure in making such objects detectable .",
    "polarization imaging at 1420mhz allows detailed analyses of discrete emitters of polarized radiation , particularly snrs .",
    "for example , @xcite have mapped the polarized emission from the full extent of the cygnus loop .",
    "however , only part of the snr is strongly polarized , with some of the shell emission depolarized by strong faraday rotation within a thermal electron component mixed in with the compressed fields and synchrotron emitting particles .    while snrs are prominent objects in stokes @xmath10 images , most are barely significant in images of stokes @xmath82 or @xmath74 . the dominant feature in all polarization images made close to the galactic plane is widespread , low - level structure , seen most prominently in polarization angle .",
    "this structure is understood as the result of faraday rotation in the magnetized ism acting on polarized signals from the diffuse galactic synchrotron radiation .",
    "it tells us less about the emitter than it does about the medium through which the polarized radiation has travelled .",
    "the study of this phenomenon is providing a new window on the ism , through its sensitivity to magnetic fields and low - density ionized material .",
    "the frequency of 1420 mhz seems ideal for such studies near the galactic plane , where the properties of the faraday screen lead to a change in polarization angle that is neither too small to produce measurable changes nor so large that it causes depolarization within the beam or the bandwidth of the telescope .",
    "the large elliptical feature seen in figure  7 ( lower left panel ) , for example , which is very uniform in structure in contrast to its chaotic surroundings , is understood as just such a manifestation of ionized material in the inter - arm region ( @xcite ) . other polarization results ( @xcite )",
    "have led to the detection of an extended envelope of a large region , and the measurement of the magnetic field in that envelope . in both cases ,",
    "the regions themselves produce depolarization due to the turbulent , high - density ionized material within them .",
    "the development and construction of the drao synthesis telescope has been the work of many people over many years .",
    "notable for their skill and dedication have been jean bastien , ron casorso , ed danallanko , jack dawson , ron mcdougall , harry mielke , diane parchomchuk , ev sheehan and rod stuart .",
    "the work has also involved many students and others who have worked at drao for shorter periods .",
    "we are indebted to them all .",
    "the drao synthesis telescope is operated as a national facility by the national research council of canada .",
    "graduate students who have worked on the development of the telescope have been supported by grants to tll , dr , and jfv from the natural science and engineering research council .",
