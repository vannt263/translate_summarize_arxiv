    "a remarkable property that has emerged , and that is most clearly exhibited by the lagrangian @xmath3 , is that while all the fundamental interactions among the particles are symmetric under a local @xmath4 invariance , the observed mass spectrum is not . in other words ,",
    "the electroweak symmetry is hidden , i.e. spontaneously broken by the vacuum . in mathematical terms , the spontaneous breaking can be made more explicit by introducing as propagating degrees of freedom the nambu - goldstone bosons @xmath5 that correspond to the longitudinal polarizations of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons ( for simplicity , from here on i will omit the lepton terms and concentrate on the quark sector ) : @xmath8 & { \\cal l}_{mass } = \\frac{v^2}{4 } \\text{tr}\\left [ \\left ( d_\\mu \\sigma \\right)^\\dagger   \\left ( d_\\mu \\sigma \\right ) \\right ] - \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\sum_{i , j } \\left ( \\bar u_l^{(i ) } d_l^{(i ) } \\right )    \\sigma \\begin{pmatrix } \\lambda_{ij}^u\\ ,   u_r^{(j ) } \\\\[0.1 cm ] \\lambda_{ij}^d\\ ,   d_r^{(j ) } \\end{pmatrix } + h.c . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the local @xmath4 invariance is now manifest in the lagrangian ( [ eq : chirallmass ] ) with @xmath9 transforming as @xmath10 in the unitary gauge @xmath11 , the chiral lagrangian ( [ eq : chirallmass ] ) reproduces the mass term of eq.([eq : sofar ] ) with @xmath12 which is consistent with the experimental measured value to quite good accuracy .",
    "the above relation follows as the consequence of a larger global @xmath13 approximate invariance of ( [ eq : chirallmass ] ) , @xmath14 , which is spontaneously broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath15 by @xmath11 , and explicitly broken by @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the limit of vanishing @xmath16",
    "the `` custodial '' @xmath15 implies @xmath18 , which is replaced by eq.([eq : rho ] ) at tree level for arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "further corrections proportional to @xmath16 and @xmath19 arise at the one - loop level and are small .",
    "in fact , the success of the tree - level prediction @xmath20 a posteriori justifies the omission in the chiral lagrangian  ( [ eq : chirallmass ] ) of the additional term @xmath21 ^ 2\\ ] ] that is invariant under the local @xmath4 but explicitly breaks the global @xmath13 . in other terms",
    ", the coefficient @xmath22 of such extra operator is experimentally constrained to be very small .",
    "the chiral formulation ( [ eq : chirallmass ] ) makes the limit of our current mathematical description most transparent : there is a violation of perturbative unitarity in the scattering @xmath23 at energies @xmath24 , which is ultimately linked to the non - renormalizability of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "more specifically , the scattering amplitude grows with @xmath25 , @xmath26   a(s ) = \\frac{s}{v^2 } \\left [ 1 + o\\left(\\frac{m_w^2}{s}\\right ) \\right ] \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] due to the derivative interaction among four goldstones that comes from expanding the kinetic term of @xmath9 in eq.([eq : chirallmass ] ) . intuitively , the @xmath27 s are the degrees of freedom that are eaten in the unitary gauge to form the longitudinal polarizations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the scattering of four goldstones thus corresponds to the physical scattering of four longitudinal vector bosons : @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "such correspondence is made formal by the equivalence theorem , which states that the amplitude for the emission or absorption of a goldstone field @xmath27 becomes equal at large energies to the amplitude for the emission or absorption of a longitudinally - polarized vector boson . as a consequence ,",
    "the physical scattering @xmath28 violates perturbative unitarity at large energies @xmath24 , and the leading energy behavior of its cross section is captured by that of the easier process @xmath23 .",
    "the merit of the chiral formulation is that of isolating the problem to the sector of the lagrangian which leads to the mass terms for the vector bosons and the fermions .",
    "in other terms :    _ we need some new symmetry breaking dynamics that acts as an ultraviolet completion of the electroweak chiral lagrangian  ( [ eq : chirallmass ] ) and restores unitarity . _",
    "as required by the experimental evidence , such new dynamics must be ( approximately ) custodially symmetric , so as to prevent large corrections to the @xmath30 parameter .",
    "the question then arises : is this dynamics weak or strong ?",
    "the most economical example of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector is that of just one new scalar field @xmath31 , singlet under @xmath13 , in addition to the goldstones @xmath27 . assuming",
    "that @xmath32 is coupled to the sm gauge fields and fermions only via weak gauging and ( proto)-yukawa couplings , the most general ewsb lagrangian has three free parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35   will be a matrix in flavor space , but in the following we will assume for simplicitly just one fermion generation .",

    "each of these parameters controls the unitarization of a different sector of the theory : for @xmath38 the exchange of the scalar unitarizes the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) scattering ( in the following , dashed and solid lines denote respectively the fields @xmath27 and @xmath32 , whereas solid lines with an arrow denote fermions ) +        @xmath41     + for @xmath42 also the inelastic channel @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) respects unitarity +         @xmath45     + finally , for @xmath46 the @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) scattering is unitarized +        @xmath49     + only for @xmath50 the ewsb sector is weakly interacting ( provided the scalar @xmath32 is light ) , as for example @xmath51 implies a strong @xmath52 scattering with violation of perturbative unitarity at energies @xmath53 , and similarly for the other channels .",
    "the point @xmath50 in fact defines what i would call the `` higgs model '' : @xmath54 ( with vanishing higher - order terms in @xmath32 ) can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath55 doublet @xmath56 and gets the usual form of the standard model higgs lagrangian .",
    "in other words , @xmath5 and @xmath32 together form a linear representation of @xmath13 . in terms of the higgs doublet @xmath57",
    ", the custodial invariance of the lagrangian appears like an accidental symmetry : at the renormalizable level , all the ( @xmath4)-invariant operators are functions of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are the four real components parametrizing the complex doublet @xmath60",
    ". an @xmath61 invariance follows under which these components are rotated , broken to @xmath62 in the vacuum @xmath63 .",
    "the unitarity of the higgs model can be traced back to its renormalizability , which is now evident from the lagrangian written in terms of @xmath60 .",
    "the weakly - interacting higgs model has two main virtues : it is theoretically attractive because of its calculability , and it is insofar phenomenologically successful , passing in particular all the lep and sld electroweak precision tests . both calculability ( which stems from perturbativity ) and the success in passing the precision tests follow from the higgs boson @xmath32 being light .",
    "it is however well known that an elementary light scalar , such as @xmath32 , is unstable under radiative corrections , hence highly unnatural in absence of some symmetry protection .",
    "it is quite possible , on the other hand , that a light higgs - like scalar arises as a bound state of a new strong dynamics : its being composite would solve the sm higgs hierarchy problem , while its being light would still be required to pass the electroweak tests .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : chlag ] ) with generic @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 gives a general parametrization of such composite higgs theories where all the other resonances have been integrated out .",
    "away from the unitary point @xmath50 the exchange of the light composite higgs @xmath32 fails to completely unitarize the theory , which eventually becomes strongly interacting at high energies .",
    "similarly to pion - pion scattering in qcd , unitarity is ultimately reinforced at the strong dynamics scale through the exchange of the other ( spin-1 ) resonances .",
    "insofar we have tacitly assumed that these latter are heavier than the composite higgs .",
    "this is in fact required ( unless some non - trivial symmetry protection mechanism is at work ) to avoid large corrections to the precision observables , for example to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath64 parameter , see fig .",

    ", height=226 ]    as first pointed out by georgi and kaplan in the eighties  @xcite , the composite higgs boson can be naturally lighter than the other resonances if it emerges as the ( pseudo-)goldstone boson of an enlarged global symmetry of the strong dynamics . for example , if the strong sector has an @xmath76 global symmetry spontaneously broken down to @xmath61 , this implies four real goldstones trasforming as a fundamental of @xmath77 , or equivalently as a complex doublet @xmath60 of @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "the couplings of the sm fermion and gauge fields to the strong sector will in general break explicitly its global symmetry , thus generating a higgs potential at the one - loop level . by naive dimensional analysis ,",
    "the expected mass scale of the other resonances is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the @xmath80-model scale associated with the composite higgs .",
    "this latter gets instead a much lighter mass @xmath81 at one - loop , with @xmath82 being some sm coupling , thus implying a parametric hierarchy @xmath83 . in this context , the electroweak scale @xmath84 is dynamically determined and will not in general coincide with  @xmath79 , differently from technicolor theories where no separation of scales exists .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 sets the size of the parametric suppression in all corrections to the precision observables , as @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) with fixed @xmath84 is a decoupling limit where the higgs stays light and all the other resonances become infinitely heavy . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath88 is enough to largely suppress any correction from the heavy resonances .",
    "it is at this point clear that the discovery of a light higgs boson alone will not be sufficient to rule out the possibility of a strong electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "experimentally , one should measure the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 as precisely as possible and look for deviations from the unitary point @xmath50 .",
    "in general these parameters are independent from each other , although they will be related in specific composite higgs models as functions of @xmath89 . ref .",
    "@xcite also showed that the behavior of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at small @xmath89 is universal whenever the light higgs boson is part of a composite @xmath55 doublet .",
    "a first determination of @xmath33 and @xmath35 will come from a precise measurement of the couplings of the higgs to the sm fermions and vectors .",
    "this will require disentangling possible modifications of both the higgs production cross sections and decay rates .",
    "preliminary studies have shown that the lhc should be eventually able to extract the individual higgs couplings with a @xmath90 precision  @xcite , though much will depend on the value of its mass . this would imply a sensitivity on @xmath91 up to @xmath92  @xcite . as stressed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , the parameter @xmath33 is already constrained by the lep precision data : modifying the higgs coupling to the sm vectors changes the infrared one - loop contribution to @xmath66 ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) by an amount @xmath95 , where @xmath96 are one - loop numerical coefficients and @xmath97 denotes the scale at which the other resonances set on and unitarity is ultimately restored in @xmath98 scattering .",
    "for example , assuming no additional corrections to the precision observables and setting @xmath69gev , @xmath70tev , one obtains @xmath99 at 99@xmath100  cl , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spar ] .",
    "measuring the higgs couplings will give important clues on its nature and on the role it plays in the ewsb mechanism .",
    "a `` direct '' probe of the strenght of the symmetry breaking dynamics will however come only from a precise study of the @xmath98 scattering .",
    "a smoking gun of strong electroweak symmetry breaking would be discovering a light higgs and at the same time finding an excess of events in @xmath52 scattering compared to the sm expectation : this would be the sign that the energy - growing behavior of the scattering cross section of longitudinal @xmath6 and @xmath7 s is not saturated at a low scale by the higgs exchange . as a matter of fact",
    ", it turns out that the onset of the strong scattering is delayed to higher energies due to a large `` pollution '' from the scattering of transverse polarizations , ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this requires defining the signal as the difference between the observed number of events and the one predicted in the sm for a reference value of the higgs mass  @xcite , since the contribution from the transverse scattering is not expected to change significantly in presence of new physics : @xmath101 .",
    "the pioneering preliminary study of ref .",
    "@xcite focussed on the `` golden '' purely leptonic decay modes and showed that perhaps the best channel to observe a strong scattering signal is @xmath102 ( all @xmath6 s with the same charge ) , see table  [ tab : wwscatt ] .",
    "more recent analyses have appeared in the literature  @xcite , also considering the semileptonic decay modes , though none of them can yet be considered fully complete .",
    "it is however quite clear that the study of @xmath98 scattering is extremely challenging due to the small signal cross section and the numerous sm backgrounds which can fake it .",
    "another smoking gun of composite higgs models and strong symmetry breaking would be the observation of the @xmath112 scattering  @xcite , which in the sm has an extremely small cross section .",
    "the importance of this channel comes from the fact that it is the only process giving information on the parameter @xmath34 , which is not constrained by the scattering @xmath52 or the precision tests and can not be determined by measuring the single higgs couplings . compared to @xmath52 ,",
    "this process is a more `` pure '' probe of the strong dynamics , since there is no pollution from transverse modes ( the higgs is the fourth goldstone together with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 longitudinal polarizations ) .",
    "an explorative analysis  @xcite has shown that the best chances of discovery are probably in the three - lepton final states , with the higgs decaying to @xmath106 : @xmath113 , see table  [ tab : wwhhscatt ] . a more realistic study with full detector simulation",
    "will however be needed to confirm these result and establish the ultimate lhc sensitivity on the parameter @xmath34 .",
