    "coherent states of light play a relevant role in practical communication protocols .",
    "one of the main advantages of these states over more exotic quantum states , such as the squeezed ones , is that they can propagate in free space and over long distances,@xcite only suffering attenuation and without altering their fundamental properties .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that such states can maximize the information transmitted in communication channels.@xcite however , encoding information on multiple coherent states@xcite requires the implementation of optimized strategies for their detection and discrimination , as they are non - hortogonal.@xcite during the last decade , many solutions , based on homodyne detection , or on / off or photon - number resolving detection , have been theoretically@xcite and experimentally investigated.@xcite the simplest setup is represented by a quasi - optimal discrimination scheme , in which the coherent states to be analyzed , namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 , interfere with a local oscillator ( lo ) @xmath2 at a high - transmissivity beam splitter ( bs ) , whose outputs are measured by direct detection ( kennedy - like receiver@xcite ) .",
    "overall , the effect of the interference is to displace the input in order to obtain completely destructive or constructive interference at one of the outputs .",
    "the main limitations in the realization of such a system are , on the one hand , the existence of noise sources,@xcite such as phase diffusion,@xcite and , on the other one , the a - priori knowledge of the lo phase.@xcite here we discuss the possibility to accomplish these two tasks by considering phase - sensitive mixtures of coherent states , which we will refer to as bracket states in view of their shape in the phase space . our strategy is based on the use of linear optical elements and photon - number resolving detectors operated in the mesoscopic photon - number domain .",
    "the bracket states are defined by the following density matrix @xmath3 with @xmath4 $ ] and without loss of generality we can assume @xmath5 , @xmath6 . if @xmath7 , @xmath8 reduces to the mixture of two coherent states , namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 , thus representing the statistical ensemble of the states sent in binary communication channels with phase - shift - keyed ( psk ) signals@xcite and equal prior probability .",
    "the opposite case @xmath11 corresponds to having a phase - averaged coherent ( phav ) state@xcite with amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that phav states have been successfully used as decoy states to enhance the security of communication channels in key distribution protocols @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the parameter @xmath13 can be seen as the amplitude of an overall uniform phase noise affecting the generation and/or the propagation of the coherent signals . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the state @xmath8 is phase - sensitive , as it is also evident in fig .",
    "[ bracket ] , where the wigner function @xmath15 of the bracket state with @xmath16 and @xmath17 is shown . +     of a bracket state with @xmath18 and amplitude @xmath17 . in the inset",
    "the contour plot is shown.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as a generic bracket state is essentially a balanced mixture of coherent states with the same energy but different phase , it has a poisson photon - number statistics and fano factor @xmath19 .        when such a state is displaced by a coherent field @xmath20 , which is the local oscillator , the first two moments of the photon - number distribution of the resulting state @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] become phase - dependent , namely : @xmath22 and @xmath23 & = & { \\rm var}_{\\varrho } [ \\hat{n } ] + 2|\\alpha|^2 { \\rm var}_{\\varrho } \\left [ \\hat{x}_{\\phi } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 = \\langle \\hat{n}^2 \\rangle_{\\varrho } - \\langle \\hat{n } \\rangle^2_{\\varrho}$ ] and @xmath26 is the quadrature operator @xmath27 associated with the field mode @xmath28 , @xmath29 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the fano factor of the displaced bracket state , which can be obtained from eqs.([meandispl ] ) and ( [ vardispl ] ) , reads as follows @xmath30}{\\langle \\hat{n } \\rangle } = \\frac{b^2 + 2|\\alpha|^2 { \\rm var}_{\\varrho}[\\hat{x}_{\\phi}]}{b^2 + |\\alpha|^2 } \\ge 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 =   tr[\\varrho(\\hat{x}_{\\phi}- \\langle \\hat{x}_{\\phi } \\rangle)^2 ] = \\frac12 + b^2 \\left [ 1 + \\cos(2 \\phi ) \\frac{\\sin \\gamma}{\\gamma } \\right ] \\label{variance}\\ ] ] is the variance of the quadrature operator , in which we used @xmath32 , @xmath33 .    when the displaced bracket state @xmath21 is sent through a bs with transmissivity @xmath34 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] , the two output beams may exhibit intensity correlations.@xcite in this particular case , the intensity correlation coefficient @xmath35 between the output beams can be written as a function of the fano factor of @xmath21 as follows : @xmath36\\sqrt{\\tau ( 1 - \\tau)}}{\\sqrt{[f(\\phi ) \\tau + ( 1 - \\tau)][f(\\phi)(1 - \\tau ) + \\tau]}},\\ ] ] that reduces to @xmath37 for a balanced bs ( @xmath38 ) . therefore , if @xmath39 , intensity correlations arise between the two emerging beams .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the experimental behavior of @xmath40 and @xmath41 as functions of the phase of the displacement amplitude .",
    "the experimental generation of bracket states was obtained by exploiting the second - harmonics ( 523-nm wavelength , 5-ps pulse duration ) of a mode - locked nd : ylf laser amplified at 500 hz ( high - q laser production ) .        according to the experimental setup shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , the linearly - polarized pulses were sent to a mach - zehnder interferometer : one of its two mirrors was mounted on a piezoelectric movement , whose displacement was operated step - by - step in order to change the relative phase between the two arms . in particular , we considered 320 different values of phase @xmath42 .",
    "the displaced state we obtained in such a way was then sent to a further bs , whose outputs were collected by two multimode fibers and delivered to a pair of hybrid photodetectors ( hpd , r10467u-40 , maximum quantum efficiency @xmath43 0.5 at 500  nm , 1.4-ns response time , hamamatsu ) .",
    "the output of each detector was amplified ( preamplifier a250 plus amplifier a275 , amptek ) , synchronously integrated ( sgi , sr250 , stanford ) and digitized ( at - mio-16e-1 , national instruments ) . as already explained in refs .",
    "[ ] , such a detection apparatus allows us to reconstruct not only the statistics of detected photons but also to retrieve the shot - by - shot intensity correlations .",
    "moreover , by following the procedure presented in  [ ] , we are also able to determine the actual value of the phase @xmath42 at each piezo position , independent of the regularity and reproducibility of the movement .",
    "the method is simply based on the linearity of our detectors .",
    "in fact , by monitoring the mean number of detected photons as a function of the piezolelectric movement , an interference pattern emerges .",
    "the normalization of such a behavior between @xmath44 and @xmath45 allows us to fit the experimental data with a cosine function and , thus , to directly estimate the value of @xmath42 .",
    "the strategy we followed is well represented in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , where we plot the different steps of our procedure .          thanks to this phase determination , the bracket states were obtained in post - selection by combining a set of data corresponding to an interval @xmath13 around @xmath42 and appending it to a second set corresponding to an interval with the same amplitude but with opposite phase .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for different choices of @xmath13 and @xmath42 , the phase - sensitive nature of bracket states is evident not only in the behavior of the fano factor and of the correlation coefficient as anticipated in the previous section , but also in the statistics of detected photons .",
    "for instance , in the six panels of fig .",
    "[ statistics ] we plot the detected - photon distributions of bracket states for different values of @xmath13 and @xmath42 .",

    "for all the statistics presented in fig .",
    "[ statistics ] we obtained very high values of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) . + the experimental behavior of the fano factor and of the corresponding intensity correlation coefficient as functions of the relative phase @xmath42 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fano ] . in both figures",
    "we plot the experimental data ( colored symbols ) and the corresponding theoretical expectations ( colored lines ) for different choices of @xmath13 values .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath52 and @xmath35 are periodic functions of the angle @xmath42 for all values of @xmath13 in the interval @xmath54 . for @xmath11 we can instead recognize the independence of the phase - averaged coherent state from the relative phase in the straight horizontal line .     for different choices of the interval @xmath13",
    "colored dots : experimental data , colored lines : corresponding theoretical predictions calculated in the actual experimental values.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   for different choices of the interval @xmath13 .",
    "colored dots : experimental data , colored lines : corresponding theoretical predictions calculated in the actual experimental values.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in principle , the capability of our detection apparatus to reveal the dependence of the output on the relative phase @xmath42 makes our scheme particularly interesting for the implementation of psk communication protocols , as it avoids both any _ a - priori _ knowledge of the phase and any preliminary communication between the sender and the receiver .",
    "the dependence of @xmath52 on the relative phase @xmath42 allows us to satisfy this requirement by simply investigating the statistical properties of the displaced bracket state . of course , in the accomplishment of this task , the use of detectors able to clearly discriminate photons plays a key role .",
    "moreover , the class of bracket states can be used to investigate the effect of phase noise in quantum state discrimination protocols by simply changing the value of the variables @xmath42 and @xmath13 in the calculation of the error probability .",
    "in fact , by setting the integration interval equal to 0 , we can produce and characterize coherent states with any phase between 0 and @xmath55 , thus having the possibility to experimentally investigate the effect of a dephasing in the preparation of the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 . with our scheme",
    "we can also simulate a phase - diffusion - like effect by setting the central phases equal to 0 or @xmath55 and choosing values of @xmath13 different from 0 .    as a matter of fact , here",
    "we have just discussed the _ capability _ of our apparatus to reveal the phase dependence , and , therefore , to monitor phase differences between the input state and the local oscillator .",
    "however , it is worth noting that , in general , the estimation of the phase difference by inversion methods may be not the best strategy and a bayesian analysis could be needed or preferred.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the generation and characterization of the class of bracket states . the excellent agreement between the experimental data and",
    "the theoretical prediction suggests the possibility to use our experimental scheme for the investigation of communication protocols in the presence of phase noise .",
    "the linearity of our detection system , which can operate in the mesoscopic photon - number domain , and the self - consistency of our method of analysis allow us to retrieve information about the relative phase of displaced bracket states by simply investigating the statistical properties of the detected - photon numbers .",
    "work is still in progress to implement quasi optimal phase - estimation strategies based on the capability of our detectors to discriminate photons , by investigating the performance and limits of the direct inversion of the fano factor @xmath40 with respect to the bayesian analysis of the output statistics.@xcite",
