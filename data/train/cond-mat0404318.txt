    "for a pure substance to be capable of exhibiting equilibrium between two fluid phases  a gas and a liquid  the interaction between its particles must include an attractive component .",
    "possibly the simplest model to incorporate attraction is the square - well potential , where particles present each other with a hard core and a uniform region of favorable potential energy up to an abrupt distance threshold beyond which there is no interaction .",
    "the square - well model has two intrinsic length scales : the hard - core diameter and the width of the attractive well .",
    "the ratio of these lengths determines the phase behavior .    in 1968 , baxter introduced a model fluid containing attraction but having only one length scale , the hard - core diameter.@xcite in this model , the attraction takes the form of an adhesive interaction when particles are actually in contact , and therefore has an effectively infinitesimal range .",
    "baxter produced an analytic equation of state for this `` adhesive hard sphere '' model using the percus  yevick framework and compressibility equation , showing that the model possesses a critical point below which gas  liquid equilibrium may be observed . a second percus ",
    "yevick equation of state  derived from the energy equation ",
    "soon followed,@xcite with a strikingly different critical point from the compressibility - equation prediction .    the percus ",
    "yevick framework also furnishes the cluster size distribution.@xcite the surface adhesion provides an unambiguous definition of clusters as connected sets of mutually touching particles . at sufficiently low density ,",
    "the fluid consists only of monomers and finite clusters , but above a temperature - dependent density threshold , clusters tend to aggregate into amorphous macroscopic structures .",
    "the system then contains sample - spanning infinite clusters and is said to percolate .",
    "the percolation threshold , at which the divergence of the cluster size occurs , has been located within the percus ",
    "yevick approximation by chiew and glandt.@xcite    baxter regarded the adhesive hard sphere model as a highly idealized manifestation of a general potential with a repulsive core and an attractive tail .",
    "however , it has since been suggested@xcite that it is quite a reasonable description of colloidal systems , where the particles interact on length scales much smaller than their own size .",
    "the gas and liquid are then more appropriately regarded as low- and high - density colloidal fluid phases .",
    "percolation can be an observable phenomenon in colloidal systems , and may sometimes be detected directly , such as by a sudden increase in electrical conductivity across the sample.@xcite the baxter model is particularly appealing in the light of recent theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite work that predicts and confirms the existence of a re - entrant glass  liquid  glass transition in colloidal systems with short - range attractive forces . for very short - range attraction",
    "there is also a glass  glass transition between a caged `` repulsive '' glass and an energetic `` attractive '' glass .",
    "a major obstacle in the application of the adhesive hard sphere model to the description of experimental data is that the model s phase behavior is only known through the approximate and conflicting theoretical results of percus ",
    "yevick theory .",
    "computer simulations@xcite have provided some information on percolation , but have not tackled the issue of phase coexistence .",

    "fluid coexistence curve , the percolation threshold , and the supercritical equation of state ( section [ results ] ) .",
    "we begin , in section [ model ] , with a definition of the model itself .",
    "it will be seen that this definition involves taking a limit that introduces a singularity into the potential energy function  an alarming prospect at first sight .",
    "the model in its strictest interpretation is indeed pathological,@xcite but the problem is rather more subtle than it first appears , and in fact starts to set in before the full limit is taken .",
    "a proper discussion of this point is deferred to section [ pathology ] , where the difficulties can be put into the context of the simulation methodology .",

    "equation ( [ potential ] ) couples the depth of the well to its width in such a way that the total boltzmann weight of bound configurations remains finite as the well width is reduced to zero : @xmath7 hence , in the limit @xmath1 , which corresponds to an infinitesimally narrow but infinitely deep well , one can write @xmath8 the heaviside step function , @xmath9 , accounts for the hard - core repulsion , while the dirac @xmath10 represents the surface adhesion .",

    "the latter requirement is enforced by the function @xmath19 .",
    "we point out that the presence of delta - functions in the boltzmann factor of a pair of adhesive hard spheres should not be interpreted as a holonomic constraint on the lagrangian of the system but rather as the limit of an increasingly stiff bond .",

    ". nevertheless , the integrals in eq .",

    "we adopt the method pioneered by seaton and glandt,@xcite and refined by kranendonk and frenkel.@xcite in a conventional monte carlo simulation the boltzmann weights of configurations are compared , where a configuration means a specification of all particle coordinates .",
    "in contrast , simulations of the adhesive hard sphere model proceed by comparing the weights of different coordination states . here",
    "we use the phrase coordination state to mean a specification of which particles are touching each other . in general , many configurations are compatible with a given coordination state .",
    "since the hamiltonian depends only on the number of contacts in the system , all configurations belonging to the same coordination state have the same statistical weight . with these concepts in mind , the key features of the algorithm may be outlined as follows .    1 .",
    "a particle ( the `` test particle '' ) is chosen at random .",
    "a list is made of the possible coordination states of the test particle with other particles in the system , keeping the positions of the latter fixed .",
    "the list always contains one item in which the test particle makes no contacts at all , and @xmath25 items where it touches just one of the other particles in the system .",
    "it also enumerates pairs of particles that are sufficiently close for the test particle to touch both simultaneously , as well as triplets compatible with three simultaneous contacts to the test particle .",
    "3 .   for each coordination state in the list ,",
    "a transition probability is calculated.[calcstep ] 4 .",
    "a coordination state is chosen at random with weight in proportion to its transition probability.[trstep ] 5 .   a uniformly distributed random configuration belonging to the chosen coordination state is chosen.[example ] 6 .",
    "if the configuration generates a hard - sphere overlap with another particle in the system , the move is rejected , otherwise it is accepted.[accstep ]    we now show how to calculate the transition probabilities in step [ calcstep ] so that repeated application of this procedure generates the correct boltzmann distribution of configurations .",
    "the total relative unnormalized weight of a coordination state of the test particle is given by the integral of the boltzmann factor over all configurations belonging to that coordination state .",
    "for the coordination state involving no contacts with other particles , this weight is the free volume accessible to the test particle , which we label @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28 being the volume of the simulation box . for a coordination state involving contact of the test particle with one other particle , @xmath29",
    ", the test particle is constrained to the accessible part of the surface of @xmath29 : @xmath30 similarly , for coordination states involving simultaneous contact with two particles ( @xmath29 and @xmath31 ) or three particles ( @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 moves that create or destroy more than three contacts simultaneously are not considered in the algorithm .",
    "a particle can , however , attain a coordination number greater than three through suitable combinations of moves where three or fewer contacts are created .    if eqs .",
    "( [ w0 ] ) to ( [ w3 ] ) could be evaluated conveniently , the canonical distribution could be generated directly by choosing a coordination state at random using these weights .",
    "the transition probability would be @xmath35 where the possible coordination states of the test particle have been numbered from 1 to @xmath36 , and the weight @xmath37 of state @xmath17 has been evaluated using the appropriate formula from eqs .",
    "( [ w0 ] ) to ( [ w3 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath38 does not depend on @xmath16 , and that all moves would be accepted , since new configurations never generate overlaps and are already chosen with the desired probability distribution .",
    "the product of step functions that appears in eqs .",
    "( [ w0 ] ) to ( [ w3 ] ) to preclude overlaps with the remaining particles in the system , makes evaluation of the weights very difficult . following seaton and",
    "glandt,@xcite we consider instead the modified weights , in which the overlap is initially ignored .",
    "the weight of the coordination state where the test particle makes no contacts is now a free integral over the container volume : @xmath39 the weight for a one - contact coordination state is an integral over the complete sphere of radius @xmath4 surrounding a particle : @xmath40 for two simultaneous contacts we integrate around a circle of configurations : @xmath41 and for three contacts , only two configurations ( located symmetrically above and below the plane defined by @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) contribute : @xmath42 the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ wp1 ] ) to ( [ wp3 ] ) can be evaluated by suitable series of variable changes .",
    "alternatively , one may consider first a square - well potential of finite width .",
    "coordination states with 1 , 2 and 3 contacts then restrict the test particle s center - of - mass to , respectively , a spherical shell , a torus with diamond - shaped cross - section , and a pair of parallelepipeds . taking the limit of infinitesimal well width",
    "then produces the same results as direct integration of the delta functions .",
    "one obtains @xmath43 unlike previous workers,@xcite we consider moves to all triplets of particles capable of simultaneously touching the test particle , not just to those triplets where @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are all mutually touching .",
    "the coordination states neglected by the latter approach can be reached by combinations of other moves , but including the direct moves should make the algorithm more efficient at low temperature or high density , where the average coordination number is expected to be high .",
    "it is the weights in eqs .",
    "( [ wp0e ] ) to ( [ wp3e ] ) that we use for the transition probability in step [ trstep ] of the monte carlo algorithm : @xmath44 to show that this choice satisfies detailed balance and leads to the correct boltzmann distribution , let @xmath45 be the fraction of configurations belonging to coordination state @xmath17 that are not blocked by overlap with other particles .",
    "the rejection of overlaps in step [ accstep ] of the algorithm means that a trial move to coordination state @xmath17 will be accepted with probability @xmath46 .",
    "the overall probability of moving to state @xmath17 from state @xmath16 is therefore @xmath47 note that the sum in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ piij ] ) depends on the positions of all the particles except the test particle .",
    "since states @xmath16 and @xmath17 differ only by the position of the test particle , this sum is the same for the reverse move , so that @xmath48 , and detailed balance is satisfied . recalling that we do not attempt moves that create more than three contacts simultaneously",
    ", detailed balance also requires that an attempted displacement of any particle that has accumulated more than three contacts is automatically rejected .",
    "having chosen a coordination state in step [ trstep ] of the algorithm , step [ example ] requires a uniformly distributed random configuration from this state to be generated . for coordination states involving 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 contacts one must therefore select , respectively , a random point in the simulation box , a random point on a sphere surrounding particle @xmath29 , a random point on the circle of contact with particles @xmath29 and @xmath31 , or one of the two points lying a distance @xmath4 from each of @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in practice , it is too time - consuming to enumerate all possible coordination states of the test particle , and this task scales unfavorably with the system size .",
    "it is therefore desirable to restrict movement of the test particle to the vicinity of its original position , so that only a subset of the possible coordination states need be identified and considered .",
    "however , as discussed by seaton and glandt,@xcite care must be taken since the normalizing sum in eq .",
    "( [ piij ] ) then depends on the original position of the particle .",
    "kranendonk and frenkel@xcite have prescribed a solution to the problem : a random point is chosen within a sphere of radius @xmath49 centered on the original position of the test particle , and this point is used as the center of a second sphere ( the test sphere ) , also of radius @xmath49 .",
    "displacements of the test particle are then considered to coordination states within the test sphere .",
    "the chance of choosing the same test sphere in the reverse move is identical , so that the modified scheme maintains detailed balance .",
    "the test sphere introduces another complication in that it may intersect some of the spherical and circular contact surfaces available to the test particle , thereby excluding a fraction of the configurations belonging to the corresponding coordination states .",
    "one must therefore calculate what fraction of each contact surface lies within the test sphere , and modify the weights in eq .",
    "( [ modalpha ] ) by these fractions when calculating the transition probabilities in step [ calcstep ] of the algorithm . in step",
    "[ example ] , one must then choose a uniformly distributed random configuration restricted to the part of the surface that lies within the test sphere .",
    "since two phases can only coexist when their pressures are equal , computational studies of coexistence often employ an ensemble where the size of the simulation cell can fluctuate in response to the pressure .",
    "the coordinates of the particles or the cluster centers - of - mass are typically scaled in proportion to the change in the cell length . in the adhesive hard sphere fluid",
    ", clusters can percolate even at moderately low density .",
    "a percolating cluster spans the simulation cell , so that increasing or decreasing the cell size in the presence of such a cluster would always involve breaking a contact or generating an overlap between at least two particles . since overlaps are forbidden , and the breaking of a bond is energetically prohibited , all trial changes in the cell size would be rejected .",
    "isobaric - isothermal and gibbs - ensemble simulations therefore fail as soon as the percolation threshold is crossed .",
    "to study density fluctuations , we work instead in the grand canonical ensemble , where the volume of the simulation is fixed , but the number of particles fluctuates in response to the imposed chemical potential .",
    "to avoid the formally infinite change in potential energy associated with the creation and destruction of contacts between particles , we only consider the insertion and removal of particles whose coordination number is zero .",
    "the procedure is therefore identical to that used for ordinary hard spheres,@xcite with the slight modification that a removal must be rejected if the chosen particle happens to have a non - zero coordination number . in our grand canonical simulations , particle insertion and removal steps",
    "are attempted with equal probability totaling 45% .    in an attempt to accelerate equilibration",
    ", we also perform cluster translation moves with probability 5% .",
    "a particle is chosen at random , and then all particles in the cluster to which it belongs are translated by the same amount .",
    "the maximum translation in each cartesian direction is inversely proportional to the number of particles in the cluster .",
    "at low temperature and high density , the formation of large , highly - coordinated clusters drastically slows down the equilibration of the simulations . to help overcome this problem",
    ", we employ the parallel tempering scheme of geyer@xcite in the grand canonical ensemble . in our implementation",
    ", several runs are performed simultaneously at the same temperature and a series of increasing chemical potentials .",
    "at sufficiently low chemical potential , one can always recover an ergodic dilute gas .",
    "parallel tempering involves periodic attempts to exchange the configurations of pairs of adjacent runs in the hierarchy of chemical potentials .",
    "the acceptance probability of such moves is given below and ensures that the correct grand canonical distribution is obtained for each run individually .",
    "the advantage of swapping configurations is that a large cluster formed at high chemical potential breaks down when transferred to lower chemical potential , while a new cluster is built up from the configuration received by the run at higher chemical potential .    using eq .",
    "( [ qn ] ) , we can write the grand partition function of the adhesive hard sphere model as @xmath50 where the chemical potential @xmath51 enters through the activity @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the thermal de broglie wavelength . the probability of observing the system in a configuration with @xmath13 particles and @xmath18 contacts under conditions of effective temperature @xmath6 and activity @xmath54 is @xmath55 the joint probability of a system having @xmath56 particles and @xmath57 contacts at temperature @xmath6 and activity @xmath58 at the same time as a second system with equal temperature but activity @xmath59 has @xmath60 particles and @xmath61 contacts is simply the product @xmath62 .",
    "the equilibrium probability of observing a pair of systems under the same conditions but with the configurations exchanged is @xmath63 .",
    "since the probability of attempting a configuration exchange is independent of configuration , the correct joint distribution is sampled if exchanges are accepted with probability @xmath64={\\rm min}[1,(z_1/z_2)^{n_2-n_1 } ] .",
    "\\label{pex}\\ ] ] the activities must be chosen close enough that typical values of @xmath65 are not too small . as the extensivity of the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ pex ] ) makes clear , @xmath65 decreases with increasing system size because of the decreasing relative size of the fluctuations .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use a larger number of parallel runs with more closely spaced activities for larger systems .",
    "a natural companion of the parallel tempering technique is multiple histogram reweighting,@xcite which allows the results from simulations of different conditions to be combined .",
    "one may then obtain rigorously interpolated data for conditions different from those explicitly simulated without the need for further runs .",
    "our implementation of this method is detailed in the appendix .",
    "it has been pointed out that for systems of @xmath66 adhesive hard spheres , the configuration integral @xmath67 diverges,@xcite and that the model is therefore pathological .",
    "the problem arises from certain maximally connected clusters in which the number of contacts between particles exceeds the number of vibrational degrees of freedom , leading to non - integrable singularities in @xmath67 .",
    "the present simulations are concerned with the fluid phases of baxter s model . under conditions where dense clusters form , aggregation tends to proceed in a polytetrahedral manner , with particles attaching to existing triangular facets due to the contact adhesion .",
    "the clusters that lead to the divergence of @xmath67 are close - packed and characteristic of the crystal phase .",
    "in contrast , regular tetrahedra are not space - filling , and so troublesome clusters are increasingly unlikely to arise spontaneously in the simulation as @xmath6 decreases .",
    "indeed , for such a short - range potential , the liquid phase is expected to be highly metastable with respect to the crystal,@xcite with a high free energy barrier between the two .",
    "here we effectively neglect the diverging contributions of crystal nuclei containing 12 or more particles .    in the event that a pathological cluster were to arise in the simulation , the algorithm described in this section would simply fail to observe the additional contact between particles that leads to non - integrability .",
    "since such `` accidental '' contacts arise from the geometrical packing of strictly monodisperse spheres , the algorithm effectively introduces an infinitesimal polydispersity . for implications regarding the applicability of the model",
    ", we refer readers to the detailed discussion by stell.@xcite",
    "a grand canonical simulation yields a histogram of the number of particles in the system  effectively the probability distribution of the reduced particle density , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the length of the cubic simulation box .",

    "the coexisting densities are given by the mean of each peak . in practice , the finite size of the simulation box means that for modestly subcritical temperatures , the two peaks overlap , and it becomes impossible to attribute the intermediate densities to one peak or the other .",
    "it is therefore more reliable to define equilibrium by equal heights of the peaks , and the coexisting densities by the peak positions .",
    "we note that , at significantly subcritical temperatures , where two separated peaks are observed , the effect of small changes in the activity about the coexistence point is to alter the relative heights of the peaks without affecting much their positions . under these conditions ,",
