    "except for sunspots and pores , the solar magnetic features are not spatially resolved .",
    "these unresolved structures tend to have highly concentrated kg magnetic fields , a fact which was already acknowledged by the early seventies ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "although such extreme concentration of the fields was never anticipated from basic physical principles , a mechanism that explains them came up soon after the discovery . the so - called convective collapse ( hereafter cc ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite )",
    "is a modification of the convective instability that drives the transport of energy in the envelopes of cool stars .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium stratification is unstable against vertical displacements , a factor that amplifies adiabatic vertical motions ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the same phenomenon takes place in magnetized plasmas and favors down - drafts along vertical field lines .",
    "these down - drafts evacuate the magnetic structures which seek a new stable equilibrium by increasing the magnetic field strength .",
    "( for details on the cc see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite . )",
    "although there is no conclusive observation proving that the cc causes the formation of the intense photospheric fields , it is systematically invoked to explain them .    as any other process to concentrate magnetic fields , the cc does not modify the magnetic flux of the region whose field strength is being increased .",
    "precursor regions having large magnetic flux are required to yield regions of concentrated magnetic fields with large flux . however , the observations show an embarrassing lack of precursors having the fluxes of typical network magnetic concentrations , i.e. , between @xmath1 mx and @xmath2mx ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "one may attribute the absence of precursors to the speed of the cc process , so that the chances of detecting a feature in its pre - collapse phase are negligible .",
    "this argument is difficult to maintain since the growth time of the cc instability is at least several minutes ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , which represents a sizeable fraction of the observed lifetimes of the magnetic concentrations ( some 10 - 20 minutes , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this shortage of large flux but weak field strength features suggests that the concentration of quiet sun magnetic fields proceeds in a hierarchical way , starting from the reservoir of unstable weak flux regions that are indeed observed ( see the lower left corner in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "these weak fluxes are first amplified to kg field strengths and the subsequent coalescence of many features renders structures with the observed flux .",
    "the concentration of weak fluxes poses a problem to the cc , though .",
    "weak fluxes correspond to small structures for which the radiative exchange of heat with the surroundings is very efficient , hampering an adiabatic evolution of the magnetized plasma .",
    "this heat leakage frustrates the full development of the cc instability ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . despite the fact that the observed weak field features are still liable for the cc ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , it would be desirable having an alternative physical mechanism that is efficient even for limited magnetic fluxes .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to point out that such a mechanism emerges in a natural way from the numerical simulations of the solar granulation : the equilibrium configuration of a km - wide flux concentration standing in an intergranular environment automatically produces kg field strengths . for lack of a better term",
    "it will be denoted as , an acronym for thermal relaxation within intergranule process . a detailed theoretical study of the mechanism goes beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "we just point out that it can operate in the sun , which opens up new possibilities to be explored elsewhere , both by numerical experiments and from an observational point of view .",
    "some of the possibilities are gathered in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "intense quiet sun magnetic concentrations are found in the intergranular lanes ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the intergranules are cooler than the mean photosphere , yet maintain a high pressure .",
    "this extra pressure arises to slow down the horizontal motions of the plasma that , eventually , sinks back to the sub - photosphere following intergranular down - drafts .",
    "as it is described by @xcite ( @xcite ) , the convergence of the flows towards the intergranular lanes is responsible for an augment of dynamic pressure that balances the deficit of temperature .",
    "firts , outflows from adjacent granules collide at the intergranular lanes .",
    "second , the shear of these colliding flows produces whirls which generate turbulent motions and therefore turbulent pressure . .",
    "assume for the moment that the magnetic structures live long enough to reach both , thermal equilibrium with the surroundings , and mechanical equilibrium within their intergranular environment .",
    "we will see that this configuration automatically demands a strong concentration of the magnetic fields with increasing height in the atmosphere .",

    "this balance occurs at every height in the atmosphere @xmath6 , @xmath7 together with this mechanical balance across field lines , there should be hydrostatic equilibrium along field lines where lorentz forces play no role .",

    "the speeds of other modes are combinations of alfven speeds and sound speeds .",

    "the time scale for viscous stresses to operate , @xmath83 , is formally identical to the magnetic diffusion time scale , except that the diffusivity @xmath72 has to be replaced with the kinematic viscosity @xmath84 . since @xmath85 ( @xcite @xcite ) , @xmath86 and viscosity does not hamper the concentration process .",

    "the characteristic time for ambipolar diffusion to operate is , @xmath87 with @xmath88 the velocity of the drift ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . according to @xcite ( @xcite ;  4.6 ) , @xmath89^{-1 }       \\bigl[{{b(z)}\\over{1500\\ { \\rm g}}}\\bigr]^2       \\bigl[{{n(z)}\\over{10^{17}\\ { \\rm cm}^{-3}}}\\bigr]^{-2 }       \\bigl[{{\\chi(z)}\\over{10^{-2}}}\\bigr]^{-1 } ,      \\label{ambipolar}\\ ] ] where the symbols @xmath90 and @xmath91 stand for the degree of ionization and the number of neutrals per unit volume , respectively .",
    "according to equation ( [ ambipolar ] ) , ambipolar diffusion becomes important in low density weakly ionized media , properties that do not characterize the sub - photosphere where the  takes place .",
    "the normalization factors for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath4 in equation ( [ ambipolar ] ) correspond to the typical values in the sub - photospheric layers ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the tiny drifts predicted by equation ( [ ambipolar ] ) imply time scales of days even for the smallest s considered here .",
    "for example , @xmath92 when @xmath93 km .",

    "then the process is not damped by ohmic diffusion , and it evolves faster than the observed life time of the magnetic concentrations . under such conditions , the equilibrium demands kg magnetic field strengths at photospheric levels .",
    "as part of the discussion on the interest of the work (  [ introduction ] ) , we argued that the seemingly empty upper left corner in figure [ fig4 ] is actually filled .",
    "it corresponds to magnetic fields which could have been concentrated by the   and whose weak flux precursors are observed ( the data in the lower left corner of the same figure ) .",
    "we pointed out that the sensitivity of the current measurement hinders the detection . to support this claim , the point represented by the black spot with error bars",
    "was added to figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it stands for a feature with @xmath94 g and @xmath95 mx , whose properties have been deduced from polarized spectra in the limit of sensitivity of the present solar polarimeters .",
    "this section aims at explaining how the existence of this weak flux but concentrated field was deduced , which illustrates the observational difficulties to sample the region of interest .",
    "the point comes from the same data leading to the shadowed region in figure [ fig4 ] ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "since we seek fluxes weaker than the weakest analyzed in the previous work , the portion of the solar surface discarded in the original analysis is used here . in particular , we selected those pixels with polarization signals of the order of the noise of the individual spectra ( below @xmath96 , in units of the continuum intensity ) . the corresponding stokes @xmath97 profiles profile denotes the variation with wavelength of the degree of circular polarization .",
    "it corresponds to the customary representation of the line polarization used to measure solar magnetic fields .",
    "] of the fe i lines at 6301.5    and 6302.5    were classified with a cluster analysis algorithm ( see @xcite @xcite for details ) .",
    "the resulting mean profiles corresponding to different classes were visually inspected for stokes @xmath97 signals with the characteristic shape of strong fields ( i.e. , with the classical shape observed in plage regions ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "note that the noise of these mean profiles is greatly reduced by the averaging of several hundred individual profiles , so that extremely weak polarization signals are now detectable .",
    "several mean profiles with the right shape were reproduced using the inversion code by @xcite ( @xcite ) which , among other physical parameters , assigns magnetic field strengths .",
    "the example used to set the point in figure [ fig4 ] is shown in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "the figure includes a magnetogram of the region pointing out the pixels from which mean profile was constructed .",
    "this inset proves that our mean profile is not an instrumental artifact produced by leakage of network polarization ( note that the selected points bear no obvious spatial coincidence with the network ) .",
    "the observed stokes @xmath98 and @xmath97 profiles as well as the synthetic counterparts used to infer the physical properties are in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "in addition , we include best fitting synthetic profiles deduced by the inversion code when the magnetic field strength at z=0 is forced to be some 500 g. obviously the fit worsens or , in other words , despite the weakness of the flux , our data correspond to regions having field strengths well above 500 g. the error bar of the magnetic field strength in figure [ fig4 ] corresponds to the standard of error of the non - linear @xmath99-minimization algorithm used to carry out the fits ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the error of the flux is just the difference of flux between the two fits in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "the stokes @xmath97 spectra from which the magnetic field was deduced have an extremely small noise ( some 10@xmath100 in units of the continuum intensity ) . improving this level represents a challenge , but it mandatory to sample the ( still ) empty region in the upper left corner of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "note that using the highly split near ir lines from which the weak fluxes in figure [ fig4 ] were deduced does not help .",
    "for reasons explained in @xcite ( @xcite ) , the ir lines are good for weak field strengths but their signals weaken for strong fields .",
    "for example , the synthesis of fe i @xmath10115648 in the model atmosphere that reproduces the polarization in figure [ figure5 ] yields a peak polarization 4 times weaker than that observed with fe i @xmath1016302.5 .",
    "the region would be undetectable if observed in the ir .",
    "in addition to the limited sensitivity of the current polarimeters , there are basic conceptual difficulties to interpret the polarization observed at these weak fluxes : extreme line asymmetries , mixed polarities within the resolution elements , etc .",
    "these problems are discussed elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) , but one have to keep in mind that they also handicap precise determinations of field strength and flux .",
    "structures having weak magnetic fluxes ( @xmath102 mx ) and standing in an intergranular environment develop kg field strengths in a few minutes .",
    "we argue that this concentrated state represents the equilibrium configuration of such structures and their natural endpoint .",
    "this new mechanism for magnetic field concentration complements the traditional convective collapse ( cc ) in the sense that it works for very weak fluxes , a factor that hinders the cc .",
    "however , the mechanism is reminiscent of the cc in many respects . in both cases",
    "the temperature of the magnetic concentration becomes smaller than the one required to balance the pressure stratification of the environment .",
    "the difference has to do with the physical effect responsible for this temperature deficit . in the case of the cc",
    ", it is produced by adiabatic displacements of plasma blobs in a superadiabatic temperature stratification . in the   ( thermal relaxation within intergranule process ) , it is produced by the radiative cooling to reach the temperatures of the high pressure but cool intergranular environment .",
    "these special physical conditions that trigger the trip automatically appear in the numerical simulations of solar granulation ( @xcite @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the motions towards and within intergranules yield the surplus of dynamic pressure (  [ equations ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the global pattern of the convective motions provides another key ingredient of the process .",
    "as we pointed out in the introduction , the formation of typical network magnetic concentrations ( @xmath1@xmath2 mx ) requires gathering many  s. this step of the process has to be hypothesized since a direct observation remains beyond our technical capabilities ( see  [ observations ] ) .",
    "the granular motions offer a gathering mechanism .",
    "they tend to drag all magnetic concentrations towards the vertices where several intergranules meet , thus inducing the formation of conglomerates of magnetic structures ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis of formation by coalescence has an independent observational support .",
    "it is observed among the smallest magnetic structures presently detected . the so - called g - band bright points , which we believe to trace magnetic concentrations , continuously split and merge , changing shape , and presumably magnetic flux , in less than a minute ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , they are swept towards the vertices by the granular flow ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the extrapolation of such observed behavior to our much smaller elements results very reasonable .",
    "in particular , because the importance of the drag force that couple the  motions to the granular flows augments as the structure becomes thinner ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "two additional features of the granular flow may also be relevant for the concentration process .",
    "first , the continuous advection of fresh magnetized plasma replenishes that part of the concentrations lost by ohmic diffusion , sucked by the down - drafts , etc .",
    "second , the rather common intergranular whirls provide stabilizing effects upon the magnetic concentrations that get caught within them ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "a sign that the operates in the sun would be finding a population of solar magnetic structures having 1.5 kg field strength and @xmath103 mx ( radius of some 14 km ) .",
