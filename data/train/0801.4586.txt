    "carbon white dwarfs ( dq wds ) with @xmath4  k can show absorption from the swan bands of c@xmath2 .",
    "peculiar carbon white dwarfs ( dq pec or dqp wds ) are relatively cool wds ( @xmath0  k ) which exhibit bands reminiscent of the swan bands , but with more rounded profiles and with centroid wavelengths located @xmath1100300  ( 700@xmath5100  @xmath6 ) shortward of the bandheads of the swan bands ( table [ t1 ] ; see also figure 3 of schmidt , bergeron , & fegley 1995 and figure 30 of bergeron , ruiz , & leggett 1997 ) . the origin of these  peculiar dq bands \" or dqp bands has been a matter of some debate .",
    "liebert & dahn ( 1983 ) first suggested they were pressure - shifted swan bands , but bergeron et  al .",

    "1995 , 1999 ) , so another explanation is required for their bands .",
    "one well - received explanation was put forward by schmidt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who attributed the dqp bands to a hydrocarbon such as c@xmath2h  rather than to c@xmath2 . as a result , dqp wds have also been referred to as c@xmath2h  wds .",
    "however , until the origin of the bands in such objects is conclusively settled , we prefer to use the nomenclature of dqp wds and dqp bands .",
    "in this contribution we report an unsuccessful literature search for known transitions from c@xmath2h  and other simple molecules that correspond to the dqp bands (   2 ) .",
    "we then revisit the issue of how c@xmath2  might produce the dqp bands (   3 ) .",

    "instead , schmidt et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggested that the dqp bands arise in c@xmath2h , which was generally the most abundant such molecule in their models .",

    "in particular , graham , dismuke , & weltner ( 1974 ) show that c@xmath2h  does not produce bands similar to the c@xmath2  swan bands .",

    "no information is available about optical bands of the branched c@xmath15 isomer , which is thought to be a nearly planar tetrahedron ( hochlaf , nicolas , & poisson 2007 ) .",
    "c@xmath15 would be a long - shot explanation for the dqp bands , but the existing data do not rule it out .",
    "absorption from all three c@xmath15 isomers would be expected in that case .",
    "bands from linear c@xmath15 are not seen in one dqp wd with the required spectral coverage ( hintzen 1986 ) , but the bands are expected to be weak .",
    "finally , for completeness we note that isotopically shifted swan bands can not explain the dqp bands : @xmath24c@xmath25c and @xmath24c@xmath24c have bands shifted about 8  and 16  _ longward _ in wavelength , respectively , from those of c@xmath2  ( king & birge 1929 ; swings 1943 ) .",
    "if we treat the dqp bands as being from an unknown diatomic molecule , we can infer some approximate characteristics of the two electronic states involved .",
    "we assume that the dqp centroid wavelengths given in schmidt et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) are the wavelengths of the ( _ v@xmath26_,_v@xmath27 _ ) vibrational bands ( 0,2 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( 0,0 ) , ( 1,0 ) and ( 2,0 ) of the same electronic transition , where _ v@xmath26 _  and _ v@xmath27 _  are the initial and final vibrational quantum numbers .",
    "the wavenumber of the ( _ v@xmath26_,_v@xmath27 _ ) vibronic transition can be approximated as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ( unknown ) energy difference between the electronic states involved , @xmath30 is planck s constant , @xmath31 is lightspeed and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants to be determined ( herzberg 1950 ) . a pure harmonic oscillator potential would have @xmath36=0 , while for realistic potentials there are likely to be additional higher - order terms ; nonetheless , the approximation in equation [ os ] is useful .",
    "five peculiar dq bands have been observed , so we can use those five @xmath37 values with their ( assumed ) associated _ v@xmath26 _  and _ v@xmath27 _  to solve for the five unknowns .",
    "table [ t2 ] , where they are compared with the corresponding parameters for the swan bands and for the optical bands of c@xmath21 . taking these coefficients at face value ,",
    "the energy difference between the dqp electronic states is 1.8% larger than between the swan band electronic states .",
    "the dqp @xmath36 values are large relative to the @xmath38 values , indicating much more anharmonic potentials than for either state involved with the swan bands .",
    "the smaller @xmath34 value for the dqp bands indicates a lower state with a potential energy curve broader than that of the swan band lower state , and the larger @xmath32 value for the dqp bands indicates a upper state with a potential energy curve narrower than that of the swan band upper state .",
    "last but not least , the negative value of @xmath35 is extremely unusual ( herzberg 1950 ) .",
    "we can find only one diatomic molecule containing h , c or o with any transition characterized by a negative @xmath36 ; namely , csh ( huber & herzberg 1979 ) .",
    "thus , the characteristics of the dqp bands argue against attribution of the bands to an unidentified diatomic molecule . in deriving those characteristics , however , we did equate the band centroids with the wavelengths of transitions involving a @xmath39 vibrational level .",
    "if that assumption is not correct , then the characteristics of the energy states involved may be less unusual .",

    "if the references cited in the sections 2.1 and 2.2 are correct ( and for them to be wrong would require laboratory spectroscopy to have missed transitions as strong as the c@xmath2  swan bands ) , then the similarity of the bands in peculiar dq wds to those in normal dq wds suggests that c@xmath2  produces the peculiar dq bands . in this section",
    "we use observations and basic molecular physics to consider how c@xmath2  might be producing the peculiar dq bands .",
    "we begin by summarizing the salient features of the c@xmath2  molecule and the swan bands .      the electron configuration of the c@xmath2  ground state ( @xmath41 )",
    "can be approximated as @xmath42 ( omitting the inner orbitals @xmath43 ) , while that of the swan band lower ( @xmath44 ) and upper ( @xmath45 ) states are @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively ( mulliken 1939 ) .",
    "that is , the swan bands are produced by vibronic transitions where an electron moves from a vibrational level in the @xmath48 electronic orbital to one in the @xmath49 orbital .",
    "( unstarred orbitals are bonding orbitals , while starred orbitals are antibonding .",
    "the subscripts @xmath50 and @xmath51 indicate symmetry and antisymmetry , respectively , of the electron wavefunctions with respect to reflection through the center of the molecule . ) because of the transfer of an electron from an antibonding to a bonding orbital , swan band absorption puts the c@xmath2  molecule in an upper state where it has a 3.7% shorter equilibrium internuclear separation @xmath52 than it did in the lower state ( mulliken 1939 ; prasad & bernath 1994 ) .",
    "the swan bands are made up of many individual rovibronic transitions ( transitions with simultaneous changes in rotational quantum number @xmath53 , vibrational quantum number _ v _ , and electronic state ) .",
    "each individual swan band is characterized by a particular @xmath54=_v@xmath26_@xmath11_v@xmath27 _  and consists of overlapping rovibronic bands with different ( _ v@xmath26_,_v@xmath27 _ ) .",
    "each rovibronic band consists of all possible rotational transitions for a particular vibronic transition ( characterized by a given @xmath54 and _ v@xmath26 _ ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath54=0 swan band contains rovibronic bands ( 0,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) , etc .",
    "each rovibronic band consists of a @xmath55 branch ( @xmath56 ) and an @xmath57 branch ( @xmath58 ) . for the swan bands with @xmath59 , as @xmath60 increases with each rovibronic band the wavelengths of the corresponding @xmath57 branch transitions continually decrease .",
    "in contrast , with increasing @xmath53 the wavelengths of the corresponding @xmath55 branch transitions first increase , then reach a maximum ( forming the bandhead of the rovibronic band ) , and then continually decrease .",
    "the swan bands are usually said to be shaded to the blue , meaning that rovibronic bands with larger _",
    "v@xmath26 _  have bandheads at shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , this is strictly true only for @xmath61 : at sufficiently large _ v@xmath26 _  the rovibronic bandheads shift to longer wavelengths with increasing _",
    "v@xmath26_.    the relative absorption strength of a particular swan band rovibronic transition ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) depends on the population of the ( @xmath64 ) level and the square of the overlap integral @xmath65 , known as the franck - condon factor .",
    "simply put , the more the maxima of the electron probability densities in the lower and upper rovibronic levels match up , the greater the probability of a transition between them .",
    "the high gravity of white dwarfs causes gravitational separation of elements . if there is substantial helium and hydrogen in a wd , the wd will have a hydrogen envelope atop a helium layer atop a carbon layer , etc .",
    "as white dwarfs cool below @xmath66  k , the hydrogen and helium layers ( or the helium layer alone , if hydrogen is absent ) can become deeply convective if they are not too thick .",
    "thus , some cool wds have helium - dominated atmospheres with trace amounts of carbon ( @xmath67 ; koester et  al .",
    "1982 ; pelletier et  al . 1986 ) as well as hydrogen ( @xmath68 ; schmidt et  al .",
    "because he is predominantly neutral at such temperatures , the atmosphere of a cool he - rich wd is highly transparent in the optical and the photosphere is located relatively deep within the star , at high pressure ( @xmath69 dyne @xmath70 @xmath71  gpa ; jrgensen et  al .",
    "the dominant source of opacity in such atmospheres is he@xmath72 ( jrgensen et  al .",
    "2000 ) , with trace heavy elements such as carbon providing the donor electrons .",
    "a lower metal abundance should therefore decrease the atmospheric opacity , shifting the photosphere downwards , to higher pressure . as @xmath73 decreases in dq wds , the carbon abundance is observed to decrease due to a decreasing efficiency of convective carbon dredge - up ( dufour et  al . 2005 ; koester & knist 2006 ) .",
    "it is therefore at least plausible that the dqp bands could be swan bands affected by high pressure .",
    "the gas pressure in a wd is governed by the hydrostatic equation @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the optical depth , @xmath50 the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath76 the density and @xmath77 the total linear absorption coefficient from all sources of opacity ( allard & wehrse 1990 ) .",
    "if dqp bands are generated by c@xmath2  at high pressure , then at @xmath78 in a dqp wd atmosphere @xmath77 must be larger , or @xmath50 or @xmath76 smaller , than at @xmath78 in a dq wd atmosphere . for a cool , he - rich wd to become a dqp wd ,",
    "a low metal abundance might be needed , since that would reduce the availability of donor electrons and reduce the he@xmath72 opacity , thus shifting the photosphere to higher pressures .",
    "alternatively , a larger value of @xmath50 might be required , due to dqp wds having typically higher masses than dq wds",
    ". however , there is no evidence that the latter is the case : bergeron , leggett , & ruiz ( 2001 ) do not find systematically higher masses for dqp wds as compared to dq wds , and there is some evidence that a subset of _ normal _ dq wds have systematicallly large masses ( dufour et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "pressure shifting of the swan bands as an explanation for the dqp bands was originally suggested by liebert & dahn ( 1983 ) but seemingly ruled out by bergeron et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in the latter paper , the photospheric pressure in a model for the dqp wd lhs 1126 was found to be three times smaller than the photospheric pressures in the coolest normal dq wds analyzed by wegner & yackovich ( 1984 ) .",
    "however , numerous inadequacies in current models of cool white dwarf atmospheres have recently come to light ( e.g. , kowalski , saumon , & mazevet 2005 ; dufour et  al .",
    "for lhs 1126 specifically , the large h / he ratio of 10@xmath79 found by bergeron et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) was shown by wolff , koester , & liebert ( 2002 ) to grossly overpredict the ly@xmath80 absorption strength in that object , which is most consistent with h / he=10@xmath81 . furthermore",
    ", neither model correctly predicts the mid - infrared fluxes of lhs 1126 recently reported by kilic et  al .",
    "no current model can satisfactorily explain the entire spectral energy distribution of the dqp wd lhs 1126 .",
    "therefore , the conclusion that it has a lower photospheric pressure than some normal dq wds , and thus that the dqp bands can not be pressure - shifted swan bands , may have been premature .    as improved models of cool ,",
    "he - rich wd atmospheres become available , it will be worth refitting well - observed dq and dqp wds to determine whether the dqp bands could be pressure - shifted swan bands .",
    "for example , homeier , allard , & allard ( 2007 ) have shown that at sufficiently high pressure , collisions of na atoms with h@xmath2  or he can shift absorption shortwards as well as broaden it .",
    "it is worth investigating if collisions of c@xmath2  with h@xmath2  or he could produce a similar effect and , if so , at what pressures .",
    "( a 50    shortward shift of the swan bands at a pressure of 10@xmath82 dynes @xmath70 was reported by bues ( 1999 ) , but no details of the calculation were given . )    theoretically , lin ( 1973 ) has shown that pressure can shift vibronic bands either shortward or longward in wavelength , that the energy shift is identical for each band , and that such bands are likely to appear increasingly gaussian at higher pressure .",
    "the dqp bands are in fact shifted by from the swan bands by roughly identical energies ( + 700@xmath5100  @xmath6 ) and appear roughly gaussian , so the dqp bands do possess some features of pressure - shifted bands .",
    "experimentally , h@xmath2  and n@xmath2  immersed in dense , high - pressure he show an increase in vibrational energy level spacing ( loubeyre , letoullec , & pinceaux 1992 ; scheerboom , michels , & schouten 1996 ) . the increase is due simply to compression of the molecule : shortening of the intramolecular bond leads to more energy being required to excite vibrations .",
    "unfortunately , even assuming the same is true for c@xmath2 , no rovibronic bands which could be used to measure such an increase appear within the dqp bands . neither is experimental information available on vibronic band shifts for h@xmath2 , n@xmath2  or c@xmath2  in he .",
    "however , in mixtures of 1% n@xmath2  in low - temperature ar , kr or xe , at least one n@xmath2  vibronic band is seen to shift to _ longer _ wavelengths as a function of increasing pressure ( semling et  al .",
    "the upper state involved in those n@xmath2  transitions has a larger @xmath52 than the lower state , so it is likely that the upper state undergoes greater compression ( lin 1973 ) , making it more tightly bound and reducing the energy difference between it and the lower state .",
    "if that is the case , the swan bands may behave oppositely ( vibronic bands shifted shortwards ) , since the lower state involved is larger and thus likely to undergo greater compression under pressure .",
    "empirically , the dqp bands exhibit some characteristics consistent with being pressure - shifted swan bands where the lower state involved is more affected by pressure than the upper state . as mentioned in the previous paragraph , the dqp bands show no evidence for bandheads . for the bandheads formed by the rotational @xmath55 branches to disappear without bandheads appearing in the @xmath57 branches , the rotational constants in the ( shifted ) lower and upper swan band states must be nearly equal : @xmath83 ( herzberg 1950 ) . since @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the moment of inertia perpendicular to the internuclear axis , nearly equal values of @xmath86 require nearly equal internuclear separations in the two states .",
    "that requirement is consistent with the swan band lower state being more affected by pressure than the upper state .",
    "another expected consequence of more nearly equal internuclear separations is a shift in the peak absorption within each swan band to shorter wavelengths due to smaller ( larger ) franck - condon factors for levels with small ( large ) _ v@xmath26_. this narrowing of the condon parabola ( herzberg 1950 ; cooper 1975 ) may also reduce the overall intensities of the @xmath87 bands in dqp wds relative to dq wds ( see   [ mag ] ) .    in summary",
    ", it seems plausible that high pressures and temperatures could distort the swan bands in such a manner as to produce the dqp bands . if detailed calculations or laboratory experiments show that pressure - shifted swan bands do indeed resemble the dqp bands , the claim that dqp wds do not have higher photospheric pressures than dq wds will need to be checked with better models of cool wd atmospheres .      generally speaking ,",
    "absorption from rotationally or vibrationally excited levels of c@xmath2  appears at shorter wavelengths than the swan bandheads .",
    "thus , as pointed out by schmidt et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , such absorption might explain the dqp bands .",
    "we consider these possibilities in detail here .",
    "vibrational excitation of c@xmath2  by itself will not suffice . for swan bands with @xmath88 ,",
    "absorption from @xmath89 can match the dqp band centroids .",
    "however , for swan bands with @xmath90 , the rovibronic bandheads never reach wavelengths as short as the dqp band centroids ( phillips & davis 1968 ) .",
    "moreover , a very high temperature of @xmath91  k would be required to populate the _",
    "v@xmath26_=7 level , as it is located @xmath112000 @xmath6 above the _ v@xmath26_=0 level .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath92 swan band has very small franck - condon factors for _ v@xmath26_@xmath933 , so vibrationally excited c@xmath2  should produce a very weak @xmath92 band .",
    "lastly , in thermodynamic equilibrium , even if levels with @xmath89 were populated , levels with _ v@xmath26_@xmath940 should be equally populated .",
    "that would yield absorption profiles _ extended _ to shorter wavelengths , but not _ shifted _ to shorter wavelengths .",
    "rotational excitation of c@xmath2  could explain the dqp bands , since the @xmath95 degeneracy of rotational levels yields level populations which peak at a nonzero @xmath53 value .",
    "since the dqp band profiles are quite smooth even at the location of swan band rovibronic bandheads , the wavelength shift for the @xmath96 level in both the @xmath55 and @xmath57 branches must be larger than the wavelength separation of rovibronic bandheads .",
    "such a shift requires @xmath3 ( phillips & davis 1968 ) , corresponding to energies @xmath97  @xmath6 above the @xmath98 level , or @xmath99",
    "k. absorption from rotationally excited c@xmath2  could be a plausible explanation for the dqp bands if c@xmath2  absorption in a dq wd occurs high in the atmosphere , so that @xmath100 is low , while the c@xmath2  absorption in a dqp wd occurs deep in the atmosphere , so that @xmath100 is high .",
    "such a scenario is broadly in agreement with the models of bues ( 1999 ) .",
    "these features of swan and dqp bands are illustrated in figure  1 , which shows partial spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ; adelman - mccarthy et  al . 2008 ) of two dq wds and the dqp wd sdss j223224.00@xmath11074434.2  ( harris et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "the existence of the latter object proves that if the dqp bands are shifted swan bands , the underlying physical mechanism does not shift the bands by only a single , fixed energy , as was believed to be the case at the time of the schmidt et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) study .",
    "furthermore , there is some indication in the spectrum of sdss j223224.00@xmath11074434.2  that the rovibronic bandheads are not completely washed out .",
    "this suggests either a lower pressure or a lower @xmath100 in the line - forming region of sdss j223224.00@xmath11074434.2  as compared to other dqp wds where no sign of those bandheads remains .",
    "note that @xmath101 is required to shift swan band absorption significantly away from the rovibronic bandheads , since those bandheads are formed by the @xmath55 branch with @xmath102 .",
    "( for @xmath103 , the absorption will be extended to shorter wavelengths but the bandheads will not be shifted to shorter wavelengths . )",
    "detailed modeling of the bands in dq and dqp wds should be able to determine whether combined rotational and vibrational excitation at a single @xmath104 can explain the band shapes quantitatively as well as qualitatively .",
    "if so , it will be possible to determine the excitation temperature ranges seen in dq and dqp wds for comparison with models .",
    "if not , pressure - shifted swan bands would seem to be the only viable explanation left for the dqp bands .",
    "it is now feasible to predict the spectra of c@xmath2  in the presence of magnetic fields of @xmath105 gauss ( berdyugina , berdyugin , & piirola 2007 ) , though no detailed calculations have been published for higher field strengths where the quadratic zeeman effect becomes important .",
    "such modeling is important because magnetic fields can shift the swan bands to shorter wavelengths ( liebert et  al .",
    "1978 ) , producing bands that resemble the ( nonmagnetic ) dqp bands . in a magnetic field ,",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath57 branches of the swan bands become circularly polarized in opposite senses ( berdyugina et  al .",
    "2007 ) . because the @xmath55 and @xmath57 branches are not separated in wavelength ,",
    "the net swan band circular polarization signal is weak for fields @xmath105 gauss ( schmidt et  al .",
    "2003 ) . however , it can reach @xmath110% at @xmath106 gauss ( schmidt et  al . 1999 ) , which may be a result of quadratic zeeman shifts .",
    "schmidt et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that dqp bands show weaker quadratic zeeman shifts than the swan bands do .",
    "however , this suggestion is not a certainty , given the possibility of a range of magnetic field strengths ( as well as geometries and orientations ) combined with a range of dqp band centroid shifts due to pressure , rotational excitation , or both .",
    "for example , it may be that a peculiar dq wd with an intrinsically moderate band centroid shift _ and _ a moderate magnetic field can have a spectrum similar to a normal dq wd with a strong magnetic field . specifically , schmidt et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that lp  790@xmath1129 is a magnetic dq and lhs  2229 a magnetic dqp .",
    "we suggest that _ both _ might be dqp wds , with lhs  2229 having the stronger magnetic field of the pair but lp  790@xmath1129 having a much larger intrinsic dqp band centroid shift .",
    "the relative field strength estimate is based on the maximum change in circular polarization between wavelengths outside and inside the swan bands being larger in lhs  2229 than in lp  790@xmath1129 ( 25% vs. 10% ) ; of course , the change in circular polarization could be affected by magnetic field geometry and orientation as well . the intrinsic dqp band centroid shift estimate assumes that the pronounced weakness of the @xmath107 bands in lp  790@xmath1129 is due to smaller franck - condon factors between energy states with reduced internuclear separations (   [ nkt ] ) . similar conclusions might apply to the similar wds from schmidt et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) : the band centroid shifts in sdss j133359.86 + 001654.8 are larger than in lhs  2229 , and those in sdss j111341.33 + 014641.7 are larger than in lp  790@xmath1129 , but each sdss object is _ less _ polarized than its non - sdss counterpart .",
    "we suggest that those two sdss objects have considerably larger intrinsic dqp band centroid shifts but somewhat smaller magnetic shifts than their respective non - sdss counterparts , leading to greater overall absorption band shifts .",
    "progress on understanding magnetic dq wds may therefore require calculations which simultaneously incorporate the effects of pressure , rotational ( and vibrational ) excitation and magnetic field strengths above 10@xmath108 gauss .",
    "we have shown that the molecular absorption bands in peculiar dq wds are very unlikely to be produced in any molecule other than c@xmath2  (   2 ) .",
    "we have considered how the dqp bands can be explained as modified swan bands (   3 ) and conclude that they could either be pressure - shifted swan bands ( as originally suggested by liebert & dahn 1983 ) or swan band absorption from highly rotationally excited levels , or both .",
    "regardless , a continuum of increasingly shifted and reshaped bands is expected to be observed in dqp wds , in agreement with recent observations (   [ rovib ] ) .",
    "one implication of our result is that the putative absence of wds with @xmath0  k which exhibit molecular carbon absorption ( dufour et  al . 2005 ) is not real  the dqp wds are such objects .",
    "another implication is that understanding the spectra of magnetic dq wds may require models which simultaneously account for the effects of pressure , rotational excitation and magnetic fields on c@xmath2  absorption .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations of the properties of c@xmath2  in high - pressure , high - temperature helium are needed to determine if pressure - shifted swan bands resemble the dqp bands .",
    "if they do not , then the only remaining explanation for the dqp bands seems to be that they arise in rotationally excited c@xmath2  ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "that scenario would require a higher @xmath109  in dqp wds than in dq wds , perhaps due to c@xmath2  absorption arising deeper in the photosphere in dqp wds ( bues 1999 ) .",
    "even if pressure - shifted swan bands are found to resemble the dqp bands , existing models of wd atmospheres suggest that dqp wds do not have higher photospheric pressures than dq wds and thus that the peculiar dq bands are not pressure - shifted swan bands . nonetheless , since there are known shortcomings in existing models of cool , he - rich wd stellar atmospheres , that tentative conclusion needs to be revisited when improved models become available . , to see if they have high photospheric pressures . although dufour et  al .",
    "( 2007b ) state that no carbon - atmosphere wd is known at @xmath73@xmath110  k , carbon - atmosphere wds were not thought to exist at all before their recent discovery",
    ". we can not be confident that all carbon - atmosphere wds develop a helium atmosphere as they cool until the origin of such objects is better understood . if predictions can be made of the spectra of carbon - atmosphere wds at low @xmath73 , the sdss provides a large database in which to search for objects with such spectra . ] if dqp wds do have higher photospheric pressures than dq wds , the reason may be that low metal abundances reduce the he@xmath72 opacity by restricting the availability of donor electrons .",
    "whichever explanation of the dqp bands is eventually confirmed , with accurate theoretical models it should be possible to use c@xmath2  absorption band profiles as a sort of barometer to constrain both the pressure and the rotational temperature of c@xmath2  in the line - forming regions of dq and dqp wd atmospheres",
    ". for example , examination of swan band fits to dq wd absorption profiles shows that the observed profiles are often more rounded than predicted ( dufour et  al . 2005 ; koester & knist 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the observed profiles may provide evidence for an increasing @xmath96 or an increasing pressure shift with decreasing @xmath73 even among normal dq wds",
    ". however , these discrepancies could simply be due to imprecise knowledge of swan band absorption parameters or to inexact treatment of the wd atmospheres or of c@xmath2  itself .",
    "for example , dufour et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) calculate c@xmath2  line profiles using the impact approximation , which is known to break down in dense dq wd atmospheres where the mean distance between particles is comparable to the particle size ( koester , weidemann , & zeidler 1982 ) .",
    "observationally , more and better parallax values for dq and dqp wds would provide information on the range of masses seen in each type of wd and help determine what contribution different values of @xmath50 make to the dqp phenomenon . it might also be useful to search for and study other c@xmath2  bands in normal and peculiar dq wds .",
    "whatever physical effect transforms the swan bands into the dqp bands , its effect on other c@xmath2  energy states , and thus other c@xmath2  bands , may be different and may serve as a clue to its origin .",
    "we dedicate this paper to dr .",
    "ralph nicholls , who passed away in january 2008 after working at york university on c@xmath2  and many other molecules since before either of this paper s authors were born .",
