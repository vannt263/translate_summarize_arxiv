    "the possibility to perform a ckm - like precision physics in the leptonic sector employing terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments has been deeply debated in the last few years . at present",
    ", the occurrence of neutrino oscillations seems rather well established @xcite .",
    "current experimental evidence indicates two hierarchical mass scale differences ( @xmath7 ) driving , respectively , the oscillations at the `` solar '' and `` atmospheric '' scale .",
    "moreover , the @xmath8 ratio is constrained by the lma solution of the solar neutrino puzzle to lie between @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite . if this scenario will be confirmed after the completion of ongoing experiments ( k2k  @xcite , kamland  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite ) and next generation long baseline projects ( minos  @xcite , icarus  @xcite , opera  @xcite ) , terrestrial neutrino experiments based on `` superbeams '' ( sb ) or `` neutrino factories '' ( nf ) could be the ideal tool for precision measurements of the pmns  @xcite leptonic mixing matrix and the discovery of leptonic cp violation @xcite .",
    "these experiments explore subdominant effects in the neutrino transition probabilities at the atmospheric scale which , in general , are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the recent kamland result places sb and nf proposals on a firmer ground since guarantees that subdominant effects will not be suppressed to an unobservable level ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this condition , however , is not enough to establish the physics reach of sb / nf . as for the case of ckm physics ,",
    "cp violating effects depend on the size of the jarlskog invariant @xcite . in the standard parameterization @xcite of the pmns matrix",
    "this coefficient can be expressed as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 . differently from the quark case , the leptonic jarlskog invariant is enhanced by the large mixing angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 . on the other hand , due to the null result of the chooz  @xcite and palo verde  @xcite experiments ,",
    "the full three - flavor mixing of neutrinos is still unestablished and only upper limits on the @xmath18 parameter have been drawn ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "moreover , no theoretical inputs are available to constrain the size of @xmath0 in a convincing manner , so that its experimental determination is mandatory .",
    "the discovery of @xmath20 has not only a scientific relevance but also a high practical value .",
    "the commissioning and running of an apparatus to observe cp violation in the leptonic sector at the atmospheric scale ( e.g. jhf - phase  ii or a neutrino factory ) is a major technical and economical challenge ; since most of its physics reach - in particular the measurement of leptonic cp violation and the determination of @xmath21 in the pmns matrix - depends crucially on the size of @xmath0 , the latter should be determined by `` phase  i '' experiments ( e.g. jhf - sk  @xcite or numi  off - axis  @xcite ) tuned to maximize their @xmath0 sensitivity .",
    "otherwise , the physics case of sb / nf should be drawn independently of their pmns reach .",
    "this is marginally possible for jhf - phase  ii ( proton decay with hyperk ) but rather unrealistic for nf .",
    "the physics case of phase  i experiments is very appealing due to their unprecedented precision in the determination of the parameters leading the oscillations at the atmospheric scale ( @xmath16 and @xmath22 ) and their significant discovery potential for high values of @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sensitivity of phase  i experiments to @xmath0 has been questioned since a significant deterioration is expected once we account for our complete ignorance of the leptonic cp phase , the sign of @xmath23 and the @xmath16 ambiguity  @xcite . in this context , the advantage of a `` pure '' @xmath0 measurement has been put forward especially in connection with new reactor experiments @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we quantify the trade - off between a setup optimized to be ancillary with respect the sb / nf project ( maximum @xmath0 sensitivity ) and one highly sensitive to the subdominant terms of the transition probability ( maximum discovery potential ) .",
    "in particular , we challenge the claim that a phase  i experiment can reach a sensitivity able to ground ( or discourage in a definitive manner ) the building of sb / nf and show that , in case of null results and without a dedicated @xmath1 run , this capability is almost saturated by first generation long baseline experiments like cngs .",
    "the next generation long baseline experiments ( minos , icarus and opera ) and phase  i experiments ( jhf - sk and numi  off - axis ) employ baselines in the 300 - 700  km range . in most of the cases ,",
    "the neutrino energy is optimized to maximize the oscillation probability at the atmospheric scale for the corresponding baseline ( @xmath24  gev ) .",
    "the cngs experiments , however , make use of a high energy beam , well beyond the kinematic threshold for @xmath25 production ( @xmath26  gev ) .",
    "the main parameters for the setups under consideration are listed in table  [ tab : list_parameter ] . in all cases",
    "the subleading oscillations at the solar scale are suppressed by at least one order of magnitude compared with the atmospheric ones .",
    "hence , oscillation probabilities can be expanded in the small parameters @xmath11 and @xmath27 .",
    "the inclusion of matter effects is simplified here , since the earth density can be considered constant along baselines shorter than @xmath281000  km . in particular , the @xmath29 oscillation probability can be expressed as  @xcite :    @xmath30}{(1-\\hat{a})^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\alpha \\sin 2\\theta_{13 } \\ , \\xi \\sin \\delta \\sin({\\delta } ) \\frac{\\sin(\\hat{a}{\\delta})}{\\hat{a } } \\frac{\\sin[(1-\\hat{a}){\\delta}]}{(1-\\hat{a } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha \\sin 2\\theta_{13 } \\ , \\xi \\cos \\delta \\cos({\\delta } ) \\frac{\\sin(\\hat{a}{\\delta})}{\\hat{a } } \\frac{\\sin[(1-\\hat{a}){\\delta } ] } { ( 1-\\hat{a } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha^2 \\ , \\cos^2 \\theta_{23 } \\sin^2 2\\theta_{12 } \\frac{\\sin^2(\\hat{a}{\\delta})}{\\hat{a}^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & o_1 \\ + \\",

    "<S> in this paper we quantify the trade - off between setups optimized to be ancillary to phase  ii superbeams or neutrino factories and experiments tuned for maximal sensitivity to the subdominant terms of the neutrino transition probability at the atmospheric scale ( `` maximum discovery potential '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath0 sensitivity is computed for both phase  i superbeams ( jhf - sk and numi  off - axis ) and next generation long baseline experiments ( icarus , opera and minos ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that phase  i experiments can not reach a sensitivity able to ground ( or discourage in a definitive manner ) the building of phase  ii projects and that , in case of null result and without a dedicated @xmath1 run , this capability is almost saturated by high energy beams like cngs , especially for high values of the ratio @xmath2 .      </S>",
