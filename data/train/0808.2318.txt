    "hidden sectors have a long and distinguished history .",
    "for example , the idea that a hidden sector may restore parity on cosmological scales is as old as the idea of parity violation itself  @xcite .",
    "such hidden sectors , containing `` mirror matter , '' have been studied by many groups , as have their possible implications for dark matter  @xcite .",

    "more recently , hidden sectors have been central to several phenomenological developments , including higgs portals  @xcite , hidden valleys  @xcite , unparticles  @xcite , and quirks  @xcite , and the possibility that dark matter may reside in a hidden sector has been discussed in several recent works  @xcite .    in considering hidden dark",
    "matter , one would seemingly be sacrificing critical virtues of more conventional dark matter candidates , namely , the connection of dark matter to the gauge hierarchy problem , and the fact that weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) naturally have the desired thermal relic density .",
    "this is not necessarily true , however . in the recently proposed framework of wimpless dark matter  @xcite , hidden sector dark matter",
    "also naturally has the desired thermal relic density .",
    "the essential idea is that , very generally , a dark matter candidate that decoupled from the thermal bath non - relativistically has a thermal relic density @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the thermally - averaged annihilation cross section times velocity , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the dark matter particle s gauge coupling and mass . for wimps with weak interaction coupling constant @xmath5 and weak - scale mass @xmath6 , this relic mass density is naturally near the observed @xmath7 .    in wimpless models , hidden sector particles @xmath8 have masses and couplings that may be very different from wimps , but which nevertheless satisfy @xmath9 in the wimpless examples discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) follows from the structure of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , which generates hidden sector masses that are proportional to couplings squared .",
    "the wimpless framework therefore naturally generalizes the wimp paradigm to other cold dark matter candidates without sacrificing the key thermal relic density virtue of wimps .",
    "if additional connector particles with both sm and hidden gauge quantum numbers are present , they will mediate sm - hidden interactions .",
    "the wimpless framework may therefore also predict qualitatively new signals , such as an explanation of the dama signal in terms of gev dark matter  @xcite .    in this paper , we study hidden thermal relics in general , and wimpless dark matter in particular . for the most part",

    "[ sec : bbn ] , we carry out a model - independent analysis of constraints on hidden sectors from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and other cosmological data .",
    "as is well known , these exclude the possibility that the hidden sector is an exact copy of the sm  @xcite .",
    "this statement assumes that the hidden and observable sectors are at the same temperature at late times , however . in the present context",
    ", there is no strong reason to assume that the observable and hidden sectors are reheated to the same temperature  @xcite , and , even if they are , for a truly decoupled hidden sector , their temperatures will differ by the time of bbn . following previous works in the context of mirror matter ( see , _ e.g. _ ,",
    "@xcite ) , we consider the cosmological constraints allowing different temperatures and find that even large hidden sectors are easily accommodated .",
    "for example , a hidden version of the sm is allowed even if the hidden sector s reheating temperature is as much as 70% of the observable sector s . alternatively ,",

    "this violates the bound of eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) , as is well - known  @xcite , and may create the impression that large hidden sectors of the size of the mssm are completely excluded .",
    "if the observable and hidden sectors are not in thermal contact , however , the hidden sector may be colder than the observable sector",
    ". this would be the case if , for example , the inflaton couplings to the observable and hidden sectors are not identical , so that they reheat to different temperatures  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the observable and hidden sectors may initially have the same temperature , either because they have the same inflaton couplings or because they are in thermal contact , but may cool independently and have different temperatures at later times .",
    "in fact , it quite reasonable that the observable and hidden sectors lose thermal contact before bbn .",
    "thermal contact would require efficient interactions between the two sectors at low temperatures .",
    "these would require light connector fields to mediate these interactions , but light fields with sm gauge charges generically violate experimental constraints .",
    "we conclude , then , that it is far from guaranteed that the observable and hidden sectors will be at the same temperature at @xmath31 ; generically , they will be at different temperatures .    to explore this possibility , we assume that the observable and hidden sectors reheat at time @xmath32 to temperatures @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",

    "model a is a 1-generation flavor - free version of the mssm , with all yukawa couplings of order 1 .",

    "perhaps even more interesting , fig .",
    "[ fig : gstar ] shows that model c , a 1-generation version of the mssm with all degrees of freedom relativistic at bbn , is allowed , even for @xmath49 .",
    "naively , one might expect a hidden sector that starts at the same temperature as the mssm and has over 100 light degrees of freedom to be completely excluded .",
    "in fact , however , such a hidden sector is much colder than the mssm at bbn times , since its cooling is not slowed by the disappearance of heavy degrees of freedom , in contrast to the mssm .",
    "this cooling is critical , given the 4th power of the temperature in eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) , and makes such a hidden sector allowed . for similar reasons , fig .",
    "[ fig : gstar ] shows that an excluded hidden sector is only made more excluded by the addition of heavy degrees of freedom .",

    "[ fig : gstar ] also shows that in some cases , rather counter - intuitively , an excluded hidden sector may be made allowed by the addition of _ light _ degrees of freedom .",
    "cmb temperature anisotropy measurements provide another constraint on the number of relativistic species .",

    "in contrast to the bbn bound , this is a 68% cl bound ; at 95% cl , the bound is very weak .",
    "this bound is therefore numerically much weaker than the bbn bound . in the future , however , cmb data from , for example , the planck satellite  @xcite will achieve a much higher sensitivity in constraining the amount of radiation energy  @xcite . at the same time , of course , the cmb bound constrains the energy density at much later times with redshift @xmath51 and observable sector temperatures @xmath52 .",
    "it is thus interesting to explore the cmb constraint when the hidden sector includes particles with mass between 1 mev and 1 ev . ( see also ref .",

    "( [ gh_heavy_light ] ) , but with @xmath27 replaced by @xmath59 .",
    "we show current cmb bounds in the @xmath60 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : gstarcmb ] , along with four example models .",

    "this may change with the strengthening of the cmb constraint in the future .",
    "in addition , it is interesting that in the presence of hidden sectors , there may be many particles with mass between @xmath27 and @xmath59 , and bbn and the cmb yield independent information about the hidden sector mass spectrum . this contrasts with the case of the sm , where cmb constraints may be viewed as consistency checks on bbn results .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : bbn ] , we found that hidden sectors may contain many degrees of freedom without violating cosmological bounds . with this as motivation , in the following section , we will examine freezeout in hidden sectors whose temperatures may differ from the observable sector s . to prepare the way , in this section we first specify a model and mass spectrum for the hidden sector .",
    "the wimpless models of ref .",
    "@xcite are supersymmetric , with supersymmetry breaking mediated by gauge interactions .",
    "a worthwhile endeavor would be to build a complete gmsb wimpless model . in this study , however , we instead work with a `` gmsb - inspired '' model .",
    "we do this for two reasons .",
    "first , our primary aim here is to clarify cosmological issues .",
    "building a complete gmsb model with a wimpless hidden sector , complete with @xmath63 term solution and other particle physics details , would take us too far afield , especially since , as we will see , the relic density is independent of many of these details . second , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the essential virtue of wimpless models , that they have the naturally correct thermal relic density , relies solely on the fact that masses in the hidden sector are proportional to gauge couplings squared .",
    "this is true for gmsb , of course , but is also valid in many other contexts , such as anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking models , lessening the motivation for detailed consideration of any one gmsb model .",
    "the model we consider has an mssm - like hidden sector , with @xmath64 gauge interactions .",
    "in contrast to the mssm , however , we assume that all yukawa couplings are @xmath65 .",
    "we refer to this as a flavor - free version of the mssm . for simplicity ,",
    "we will focus on a 1-generation flavor - free version of the mssm , but , as all yukawa couplings are large , we will use 3rd generation nomenclature for this one generation of hidden matter fermions and sfermions .",
    "all hidden superpartners are assumed to have mass @xmath66 , the superpartner mass scale .",
    "in addition , since @xmath67 also sets the scale for the higgs boson parameters , the hidden higgs bosons @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 also have this mass , as do the hidden weak gauge bosons @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "given @xmath65 yukawa couplings , the hidden fermions @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are therefore also at the superpartner mass scale .",
    "the light , effectively massless particles are the hidden photon @xmath77 , gluon @xmath78 and neutrino @xmath79 .",
    "as is typical of gmsb , the gravitino is also light , and its relic density from late decays to the gravitino is negligible .",
    "we further assume low or moderate reheating temperatures so that the abundance of gravitinos produced during reheating is also insignificant .",
    "wimpless dark matter requires that one particle at the @xmath67 mass scale be stable .",
    "we assume that the lightest @xmath67 scale particle is the hidden right - handed stau @xmath80 .",
    "this is the lightest superpartner in much of gmsb parameter space , and it is also reasonable to assume that it is lighter than the @xmath74 , given @xmath65 yukawa couplings , just as the stop may be lighter than the top in the mssm .",
    "the stau s stability is then guaranteed by hidden sector electric charge conservation .",
    "one might worry about the viability of a charged dark matter candidate .",
    "efficient compton scattering of hidden staus on hidden photons @xmath81 would lead to dissipative energy loss , making the dark matter particles behave more like baryons .",
    "however , this scattering cross section is @xmath82 , which , given eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , is as weak as the sm weak interactions .",
    "hidden sector charged dark matter is therefore consistent with the known properties of dark matter from structure formation .",
    "given the few light states , there are only a few dark matter annihilation channels : @xmath83 the neutrino channel is mediated by an @xmath84-channel @xmath73 .",
    "the gauge boson final states are produced through processes with @xmath85 in @xmath86- and @xmath87-channels and 4-point @xmath88 and @xmath89 vertices .",
    "the relic density is therefore dependent on only a few of the many supersymmetric parameters , which we will now discuss .",
    "note that we assume no left - right stau mixing .",
    "all three gauge couplings enter the analysis .",
    "the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings enter the annihilation cross sections .",
    "the su(3 ) gauge coupling must also be specified , because it determines the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at bbn .",
    "for simplicity , for the hidden gauge couplings , we adopt assumptions motivated by unification .",
    "gauge coupling unification implies that the hidden weak mixing angle is @xmath90 at the gut scale . in principle , this is modified by renormalization group ( rg ) evolution .",
    "the rg equations for the hidden sector mssm gauge couplings are @xmath91 where @xmath92 for the 1-generation case , and @xmath93 for the 3-generation case . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : relic ] , however , wimpless models are valid in the ranges @xmath94 and @xmath95 , depending on the reheating temperature ratio @xmath45 .",
    "for most of this range , then , @xmath96 , and the fractional change in the gauge couplings from rg evolution is @xmath97 ; that is , the gauge couplings evolve very little . given this",
    ", we will assume @xmath98 at @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath99 , this is not the prediction of unification , and our assumption therefore implicitly assumes some more complicated structure .",
    "the unification assumption also typically implies that the hidden confinement scale @xmath100 is far below @xmath27 .",
    "for example , for the 1-generation case , taking @xmath101 and @xmath102 , we find @xmath103 .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath104 , and so the hidden gluons contribute to @xmath105 at bbn . again",
    ", this does not follow from unification for the largest @xmath67 .",
    "we will identify @xmath106 with the hidden su(2 ) gauge coupling @xmath78 .",
    "as for the hidden mssm mass spectrum , we assume that all massive hidden particles have masses in the range @xmath107 , and that all relativistic degrees of freedom are always at the same temperature",
    ". the effective relativistic degrees of freedom in the hidden sector are then @xmath108 for the 1-generation ( 3-generation ) case , and we linearly interpolate between these two values for @xmath13 between @xmath67 and @xmath109 .",
    "the exact spectrum in this range is largely irrelevant for the relic abundance calculation , since we consider only dark matter that is non - relativistic at freezeout . given these assumptions , the thermal relic density is completely determined by only four parameters : @xmath110    in fig .",

    "[ fig : xi ] , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : freezeout_mx ] that our analysis is self - consistent even for @xmath67 as low as 10 kev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmapgxmx ] we present contours of constant @xmath157 in the @xmath178 plane .",

    "[ fig : wmapgxmx ] use the relic density as determined at @xmath181 , where it has truly stabilized .",
    "figure  [ fig : wmapgxmx ] summarizes all of our work so far , and there are several noteworthy features .",
    "first , we see that these contours essentially follow the scaling relation @xmath182 .",
    "if , for example , @xmath67 is lowered by a factor of 4 and @xmath106 is lowered by a factor of 2 , the weakened interaction implies earlier freezeout and larger @xmath170 , but this compensates the lower @xmath67 to keep the relic density @xmath183 approximately invariant .",
    "alternatively , using the analytic results presented above , this scaling relation keeps @xmath184 invariant , and , given eq .",
    "( [ y0 ] ) , this also keeps @xmath157 invariant . of course",
    ", this is as expected from the general arguments given in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , but fig .",
    "[ fig : wmapgxmx ] shows that these arguments , based essentially on dimensional analysis , are in fact supported by a detailed calculation in the context of a concrete model with dark matter masses varying greatly and far beyond the conventional wimp range .",
    "second , for comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig : wmapgxmx ] also includes two dashed contours to indicate the corresponding observable sector weak mass scale @xmath185 .",
    "the definition of @xmath185 depends on how one chooses to characterize the natural weak scale in supersymmetric theories ( the @xmath63 parameter , the bino mass , etc . ) , and these depend on several parameters , such as the number of messengers and the messenger scale .",
    "we simply choose @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the u(1 ) gauge coupling of the mssm , and plot contours for @xmath188 and 1 tev .",
    "the fact that there exist values in the @xmath189 plane that give the correct @xmath157 is , of course , not surprising .",
    "however , the fact that the two solid curves lie between the two dashed curves means that the preferred values of @xmath178 are those that correspond to models in which the observable sector s superpartners are at the weak scale .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : wmapgxmx ] that , for a fixed @xmath67 , lower @xmath45 requires lower @xmath106 to obtain the correct relic density .",
    "this is because , at a given observable temperature @xmath12 , colder hidden sectors imply lower equilibrium number densities . to keep the relic density constant",
    ", @xmath106 must be lower so that freezeout happens earlier .",
    "this is consistent with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezeout_xi ] .",
    "finally , note that the @xmath190 contour ends at @xmath191 .",
    "this is because the criterion that dark matter freezeout while non - relativistic , that is , @xmath192 , is violated below this mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mxin ] , we plot , as a function of @xmath45 , the lower mass limit resulting from requiring that freezeout occurs with @xmath192 and yields @xmath193 .",
    "we can see that the lower mass limit goes up with smaller @xmath45 .",
    "this is because for colder hidden sectors , freezeout occurs earlier , and to satisfy @xmath194 , we need larger @xmath67 .",
    "this exercise establishes that the wimpless dark matter framework may be valid at least down to dark matter masses of @xmath195 . below this mass ,",
    "freezeout is not non - relativistic , and our analysis breaks down .",
    "it would be interesting to perform a more precise analysis without assuming non - relativistic freezeout , but this is beyond the scope of our study .",
    "throughout this work , we have ignored the possible existence of connector particles @xmath196 with both sm and hidden gauge charges .",
    "if these are added , do they significantly affect the conclusions derived above ?    there are two significant roles that connector particles can have .",
    "first , they likely establish thermal connectivity between the observable and hidden sectors when the temperatures are above the connector mass scale @xmath197 . at temperatures below @xmath197 , however , the hidden - sm interactions become weak , and the observable and hidden sectors decouple . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : gstar ] and [ fig : gstarcmb ] , the bbn and cmb constraints actually allow , for example , a 1-generation flavor - free version of the mssm with @xmath198 , even when @xmath199 . in this case , then , there is no problem if the two sectors are in thermal contact right after reheating . for other hidden sectors",
    ", it may be possible that the existence of connectors enforces @xmath199 , or alternatively , the assumption of @xmath200 implies an upper bound on the reheating temperatures .",
    "one must check on a case by case basis whether connector particles upset the premises of our calculations .",
    "a second affect is that connector particles open new avenues for dark matter annihilation . as an example",
    ", we assume that fermionic connector particles @xmath196 couple through yukawa couplings @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is a sm fermion .",
    "we expect @xmath203  @xcite , and also require @xmath204 to prevent the decay @xmath205 .",
    "such connector interactions induce annihilations @xmath206 through processes with @xmath196 particles in the @xmath86-channel .",
    "there are two cases . if @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 on the other hand , if @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 in either case , the annihilation cross section to sm particles is small relative to the completely hidden annihilation cross sections @xmath213 , provided @xmath214 .",
    "this is a rather weak criterion , and so typically , annihilation to sm particles is sub - dominant , and the analysis given above holds even in the presence of connector particles .",
    "in the paper , we have studied the possibility that dark matter is hidden , that is , has no sm gauge interactions .",
    "hidden sectors appear in many frameworks for physics beyond the sm , and hidden dark matter is perfectly viable , given all observations to date .",
    "we are particularly motivated by the recent proposal of wimpless dark matter . as with wimps , wimpless dark matter has the key virtue that its thermal relic density is in the right range to be cold dark matter .",
    "in contrast to wimps , however , wimpless dark matter may have masses and couplings that differ drastically from wimps .",
    "although hidden sectors interact very weakly with the sm , hidden particles contribute to the energy density of the universe .",
    "this impacts the expansion rate of the universe , and so bounds from bbn and the cmb constrain hidden sectors .",
    "as is well known , current constraints completely exclude a hidden sector that is an exact copy of the mssm .",
    "we find , however , that these constraints are rather brittle and easily avoided if the hidden sector is just slightly colder than the observable sector or if the mass scale of hidden superpartners differs from the mssm .",
    "several viable examples are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bbn ] , and figs .",
    "[ fig : gstar ] and [ fig : gstarcmb ] give model - independent bounds that can be used to determine the viability of other models .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : concrete ] , we then defined a concrete model , a 1-generation flavor - free version of the mssm .",
    "this model has features generic to gmsb models and provides a wimpless dark matter candidate , the hidden stau @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath85 relic density depends sensitively on only a small number of parameters .",
    "this relic density was examined in sec .",
    "[ sec : relic ] by solving the boltzmann equation numerically , and understanding these results through well - known analytic approximations , generalized to hidden sectors with different temperatures .",
    "these results confirm that in wimpless models with @xmath215 , the relic density is naturally in the right range for dark matter masses @xmath10 , greatly extending the conventional wimp mass range .",
    "wimpless dark matter therefore provides a class of dark matter candidates that shares the key relic density virtue of wimps .",
    "this generalization may have interesting applications , given the diverse and interesting phenomenology and observational anomalies already present at the kev , mev , gev , and tev mass scales .",
    "we have determined the allowed range of @xmath67 by requiring that this dark matter freezes out with the right relic density while non - relativistic .",
    "of course , this range may be further constrained by other considerations .",
    "in particular , the lightest wimpless candidates , with @xmath195 , may have interesting implications for structure formation .",
    "after freeze out , they can still couple to the hidden sector thermal bath through elastic scattering processes @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "after their kinetic decoupling at temperature @xmath218 , they then stream freely between over- and under - dense regions .",
    "free - streaming of thermal relics causes damping in density perturbations  @xcite at a comoving scale @xmath219 ; in contrast to wimps  @xcite , this is the dominant effect for mev or lighter dark matter  @xcite .",
    "if this scale falls in the range @xmath220 mpc , the linear matter power spectrum from high - resolution lyman-@xmath221 forest data can be used to place a lower bound on the mass of the dark matter particle .",
    "current lower mass limits on warm dark matter of @xmath222 from lyman-@xmath221 data  @xcite therefore imply lower mass bounds in the wimpless scenario , which depend on the kinetic decoupling temperature @xmath218 for different @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , another kind of dark matter lower mass limit follows from the observation that the phase - space density of the dark matter particles in galaxy halos can not exceed the maximum value of the phase - space density when the dark matter particles were in kinetic equilibrium  @xcite . with knowledge of the wimpless dark matter s chemical potential",
    ", one can then apply these generalized tremaine - gunn bounds from ref .",
    "@xcite to our scenario .",
    "detailed considerations of these effects are beyond the scope of this study , but they may modify the lower bound on @xmath67 or , alternatively , provide interesting astrophysical signals for the hidden dark matter scenarios discussed here .",
