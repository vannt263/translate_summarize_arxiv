    "there are two categories of events relevant to the present discussion : physics signals ( phy ) and electronic noise ( ele ) .",
    "the phy events are due to actual energy depositions at the ulege by gammas , neutrons , neutrinos , wimps and other radiations , while ele events are induced by the various stages in the readout electronics .",
    "the majority of the events above the noise edge of 300  ev are phy - events .",
    "a particularly good method to extract a clean sample of phy - events below the noise edge for further studies is to require that the ulege signals are in coincidence with the anti - compton veto ( acv ) tag .",
    "however , phy - events due to neutrinos or dark matter interactions would have to be in anti - coincidence with acv .",
    "a major goal of the experiment is to lower the threshold by suppressing ele while keeping phy - events in some substantially large and known fraction .    in order for phy - events to be included in the final spectra where physics is extracted , they have to survive three procedures , the efficiency of each of which must be known .",

    "this efficiency is independent of the energy of phy .",
    "analysis efficiency ( @xmath40 ) @xmath1 that offline software procedures would retain phy and suppress ele . some phy would be rejected in the process leading to an efficiency factor which is energy - dependent .    among these three efficiency factors ,",
    "the derivations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 were discussed in ref .",
    "the @xmath39 was evaluated accurately by `` random trigger '' ( rt ) events to be 89%  fraction of the rt events actually recorded in the computer .",
    "( cited in table  1 as `` daq dead time '' of 11.0% . )",
    "same procedures were used in our earlier work on neutrino magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath40 by two different approaches was discussed in the text and the results were shown in figure  3 .",
    "further elaborations are made in ref .",
    "the rest of this reply would focus on @xmath38 .",
    "ref .  @xcite challenged our values of @xmath41 , stating that the `` discriminator threshold of 20  ev '' and `` rms resolution of pedestal ( that is , rt events ) of 55  ev '' would imply a daq rate ( @xmath42 ) of @xmath620k  hz , based on a known relation  @xcite @xmath43   ~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the shaping time ( = 6  @xmath15s for the trigger signal @xmath16 ) , @xmath26 is the rms of the pedestal noise fluctuations and @xmath45 is the threshold level above the pedestal .",
    "the calculated rate is much higher than the actual daq rate of @xmath65  hz for the ulege in the actual measurement .",
    "this discrepancy originates from the fact that it is incorrect to use these two energy values together in eq .",
    "[ eq::daqrate ] . in the experiment ,",
    "the `` energy '' of an event is defined by integrating ( the `` q - mode '' ) the @xmath17 signal within time intervals ( -20,51.2 )  @xmath15s where t=0 denotes the trigger instant .",
    "that is , the energy is measured through the summation of 71.2x20=1424 fadc numbers . under this definition , the pedestal ( rt )",
    "events have an rms resolution of 55  ev , after appropriate calibration",
    ". however , the triggering was done by comparing the @xmath16 signal with a pre - set discriminator level .",
    "that is , the relevant quantity in this operation is the amplitude of the pulse ( the `` a - mode '' ) @xmath1 and in fact of a different pulse ( @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 , but this is a minor point ) . _",
    "the rms - resolution of rt events in q - mode is not related to the trigger configuration in a - mode and therefore should not be taken as the @xmath26 of eq .",

    "@xcite , we present the evaluation of @xmath38 in what follows . displayed in figures  [ singleevent]a&b are typical @xmath16 signals for rt and phy events , respectively .",
    "the amplitude is presented in fadc unit ( 2  v is equivalent to 256  fadc  unit ) .",
    "the phy - event was measured to be 139  ev in the q - mode , and in coincidence with acv .",
    "superimposed is the discriminator level ( 38@xmath02  mv in hardware unit , uncertainties mostly from instabilities over time ) which is 4.8  fadc  unit above the mean value of the pedestal level .",
    "it can be seen that the rt event is below threshold while the phy event is above threshold by @xmath6 1.5  fadc unit , thereby provided a trigger to the daq system with good margin .",
    "histograms of large samples of events like those of figures  [ singleevent]a&b is presented in figure  [ amode ] , where the horizontal axis is in fadc unit .",
    "the `` random noise '' histogram corresponds to the distribution of the amplitudes of every time - bin of the rt - events .",
    "the rms is 1.1  fadc  unit and represents the noise fluctuation of the @xmath16 signal .",
    "the discriminator threshold level is also shown .",
    "accordingly , one can equate @xmath44=6  @xmath46 , @xmath45=4.8@xmath00.3 and @xmath26=1.1 in eq .",
    "[ eq::daqrate ] , giving @xmath47 .",
    "the measured rate averaged over the entire daq periods of about 17 days and for four channels together is @xmath65  hz .",
    "this is in good agreement .",
    "the various distributions show the maximum amplitude of phy - events at various energy ranges measured by the q - mode .",
    "all the events above 100  ev ( the relevant range for subsequent analysis ) exhibit at least 1  fadc  unit of margin above threshold .",
    "the trigger efficiencies were then derived using the maximum amplitude distributions of the rt events at e=0 and the phy - events between 300  ev to 1000  ev . the mean and rms for the e=0@xmath1300  ev regions were evaluated by interpolation ( rather than from actual data ) to avoid biased sampling .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ trigeff ] .",
    "we note that the energy range that provides the most severe constraints to the dark matter analysis is that of 200 - 250  ev , where the trigger efficiency is close to unity .        using phy - events as well as data taken with precision test pulser",
    ", it can be shown that energy measurements with q - mode ( integration ) and a - mode ( maximum amplitude ) are both valid and equivalent for pulses which are large compared to the noise fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the q - mode measurements are well - behaved and linear all the way towards the pedestal zero - energy level . on the contrary , the a - mode measurements become inaccurate and the calibration is non - linear as the energy decreases and approaches zero . _",
    "although the threshold is well - defined in amplitude ( 4.8@xmath00.3  fadc  unit ) , the statement `` discriminator threshold at 20  ev '' in ref .",
    "@xcite has been misleading and too simplistic .",
    "it is incorrect to equate the threshold to a single number in q - mode as its energy scale .",
    "_ that is , the trigger efficiency versus energy curve of figure  [ trigeff ] is not a step - function .",
    "for instance , @xmath48% corresponds to an energy range of about 80@xmath050  ev .",
    "this is the root of the misunderstanding and is corrected in the revised text .",
    "another point noted in ref .",
    "@xcite is the comparison of spectra in ref .",
    "@xcite with those taken at the y2l underground laboratory in south korea  @xcite .",
    "such comparisons would not be appropriate .",
    "different detectors were used even though the specifications are similar .",
    "the electronic modules and noise sources ( which are affected by many ambient conditions ) are not identical .",
    "the most important difference is that we did not make an attempt to use pulse shape differentiation ( psd ) techniques to suppress ele - events with y2l data .",
    "the spectra shown with y2l data are always without psd cuts , such that the raw `` background '' @xmath1 dominated by ele - events @xmath1 below the noise edge are extremely high . daq rates in both cases are similar , at the range 1 - 10  hz . displayed in figure  [ ksy2l ] are the raw spectra for both ks and y2l , as well as that after psd suppression for ks .",
    "it can be seen that the raw spectra are comparable .",
    "the residual differences are due to ambient electronic noise and radioactive background conditions .",

    "these are the probabilities that potential signal events that will survive these cuts .",

    "the selected time interval is optimized for energies near threshold ( @xmath51 ) , such that this interval no longer corresponds to the amplitude - peaks of sa@xmath49 for events at higher energy .",

    "the 50% efficiency line would correspond to 224  ev instead of 216  ev , while the @xmath11 limits ( in units of @xmath66 throughout in this section ) at @xmath67 would increase ( become less constraining ) from 0.81 to 0.88 .",
    "a compilation of all quenching factor ( qf ) measurements on germanium is given in figure  [ qfdata ] . overlaid",

    "it can be seen that the trim results explain well the qf measurements at both low and high energy .",
    "accordingly , we chose to use this scheme in our analysis .",
    "the qf values are less than those evaluated with the lindhard ( k=0.20 ) model , and hence would give rise to more conservative results .",

    "the qf uncertainty estimations of 0.006 in ref .",
    "@xcite can account for this deviation .",
    "this alternative choice will only have minor effects on the exclusion limits , decreasing it ( becoming more constraining ) from 0.81 to 0.80 at @xmath68      the unbinned `` optimal interval method '' as formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite was adopted to derive the exclusion limits .",
    "the unbinned formalism allows the use of all available information in the background spectra and was used in other cdm experiments like cdms and xenon .",
    "no background profile was assumed or subtracted , which is also a conservative approach .",
    "the sensitivities at low @xmath5 under this scheme are driven by the absence of counts between 198  ev and 241  ev .",
    "an alternative method would be to place the background events in different energy bins and follow the formalism of ref .",
    "for instance , choosing 50-ev bins for e@xmath69100  ev ( thereby deliberately filling the hole at 200@xmath1250  ev ) , the @xmath11 limit at @xmath68 would increase ( become less constraining ) from 0.81 to 1.20 .",
    "this reduction in sensitivities is expected since data binning involves loss of information .",
    "we conclude that our choices in these three aspects of the experiment are justified .",
    "the sensitivities of the physics results ( exclusion upper limits ) are dominated by the statistical uncertainties of the background spectra .",
