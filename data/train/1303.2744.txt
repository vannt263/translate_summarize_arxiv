    "<S> relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei , galactic microquasars , and gamma - ray bursts are widely considered to be magnetohydrodynamically driven by black hole accretion systems , although conversion mechanism from poynting into particle kinetic energy flux is still open . </S>",
    "<S> recent detailed numerical and analytical studies of global structures of steady , axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows with specific boundary conditions have not reproduced as rapid an energy conversion as required by observations . in order to find more suitable boundary conditions , we focus on the flow along a poloidal magnetic field line just inside the external boundary , without treating transfield force balance in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we find some examples of the poloidal field structure and corresponding external pressure profile for an efficient and rapid energy conversion as required by observations , and that the rapid acceleration requires a rapid decrease of the external pressure above the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> we also clarify the differences between the fast magnetosonic point of the mhd flow and the sonic point of de laval nozzle . </S>"
