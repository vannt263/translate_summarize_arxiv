    "solitary - wave excitations in discrete nonlinear dynamical models ( lattices ) is a subject of great current interest , which was strongly bolstered by experimental observation of solitons in arrays of linearly coupled optical waveguides @xcite and development of the diffraction management ( dm ) technique , which makes it possible to effectively control the discrete diffraction in the array , including a possibility to reverse its sign ( make the diffraction anomalous ) @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that a lattice subject to periodically modulated dm can also support stable solitons , both single - component ones @xcite and two - component solitons with nonlinear coupling between the components via the cross - phase - modulation ( xpm ) @xcite .",
    "two - component nonlinear - wave systems , both continuum and discrete , which feature a _ linear _ coupling between the components , constitute a class of media which can support gap solitons ( gss ) .",
    "a commonly known example of a continuum medium that gives rise to gss is a nonlinear optical fiber carrying a bragg grating @xcite , whose standard model is based on the equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are amplitudes of the right- and left - propagating waves , and the bragg - reflection coefficient is normalized to be @xmath7 .",
    "another optical system that may give rise to gss is a dual - core optical fiber with asymmetric cores , in which the dispersion coefficients have opposite signs @xcite .    in this work , we demonstrate that the use of the dm technique provides for an opportunity to build a double lattice in which two discrete subsystems with _ opposite _ signs of the effective diffraction are linearly coupled , thus opening a way to theoretical and experimental study of discrete gss , as well as of solitons of different types ( solitons in linearly coupled lattices with identical discrete diffraction in the two subsystems have recently been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ; a possibility of the existence of discrete gss in a model of a nonlinear - waveguide array consisting of alternating cores with two different values of the propagation constant was also considered recently @xcite ) .",
    "the objective of the work is to introduce this class of systems and find fundamental solitons in them , including the investigation of their stability .",
    "we will also consider , in a more concise form , another physically relevant possibility , viz .",
    ", a discrete system with a second - harmonic - generating ( shg ) nonlinearity , in which the diffraction has opposite signs at the fundamental and second harmonics .",
    "solitons will be found and investigated in the latter system too .",
    "it is relevant to start with equations on which our @xmath2 model ( the one with the cubic nonlinearity ) is based , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are complex dynamical variables in the two arrays ( sublattices ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being coefficients of the linear and xpm coupling between them , and @xmath13 is actually not time , but the propagation distance along waveguides , in the case of the most physically relevant optical interpretation of the model .",
    "the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent discrete diffraction induced by the linear coupling between waveguides inside each array , the diffraction being normal in the first sublattice and anomalous in the second , with a _ negative _ relative diffraction coefficient @xmath16 and intersite coupling constant @xmath17 ( one may always set @xmath18 , which we assume below ) .",
    "physical reasons for having @xmath19 are explained below . finally , the real coefficient @xmath20 accounts for a wavenumber mismatch between the sublattices",
    ".    we also choose a similar shg model , following the well - known pattern of discrete shg systems with normal diffraction at both harmonics @xcite , @xcite : @xmath21 where the asterisk stands for the complex conjugation and @xmath11 is a real mismatch parameter .",
    "in this case too , we assume @xmath19 .",
    "there are at least two different physical realizations of the @xmath2 model based on eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) .",
    "first , one may consider two parallel arrays of nonlinear waveguides with different effective values @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the refractive index in them corresponding to a given ( oblique ) direction of the light propagation . to this end",
    ", the waveguides belonging to the two arrays may be fabricated from different materials ; alternatively , they may simply differ by the transverse size of waveguiding cores , or by the refractive index of the filling between the cores , see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] .",
    "the difference in the effective refractive index gives rise to the mismatch parameter @xmath20 in eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) .",
    "more importantly , it may also give rise to different coefficients of the discrete diffraction .",
    "indeed , the dm technique assumes launching light into the array obliquely , the effective diffraction coefficient in each array being @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spacing of both arrays , and @xmath26 are transverse components of the two optical wave vectors . as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , the diffraction coefficients are different if @xmath27 .    despite the fact that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are assumed different , we assume that the propagation directions of the light beams are parallel in the two arrays , as a conspicuous walkoff ( misalignment ) between them",
    "will easily destroy any coherent pattern . on the other hand ,",
    "the light coupled into both arrays has the same frequency , hence the absolute values of the two wave vectors are related as follows : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the above - mentioned effective refractive indices . combining the latter relation and the classical refraction law , and taking into regard the condition that the propagation directions are parallel inside the arrays , one readily arrives at the conclusion that @xmath32 note that the two incidence angles @xmath33 ( at the interface between the arrays and air ) are related in a similar way , @xmath34",
    ", hence the incident beams ( in air ) must be _ misaligned _ , in order to be aligned in the arrays .",
    "= 7.5 cm    equation ( [ d ] ) shows that there is a critical direction of the beam in each array , corresponding to @xmath35 , at which the effective diffraction coefficient changes its sign @xcite . due to the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,",
    "the critical directions are different in the two arrays .",
    "then , if the common propagation direction in the arrays is chosen to be _ between _ the two critical directions , eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) gives different signs of the two diffractive coefficients .",
    "note that this interpretation of the model implies no xpm coupling between the arrays , i.e. , @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) .",
    "an alternative realization is possible in a single array of _ bimodal _ optical fibers , into which two parallel beams with orthogonal polarizations , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are launched obliquely . if the two polarizations are circular ones , then @xmath39 in eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) , and the asymmetry between the beams , which makes it possible to have different signs of the coefficient ( [ d ] ) for them , may be induced by birefringence , which , in turn , can be easily generated by twist applied to the fibers @xcite .",
    "the birefringence also gives rise to the mismatch @xmath20 .",
    "as for the linear mixing between the two polarizations , which is assumed in the model , it can be easily induced if the fibers are , additionally , slightly deformed , having an elliptic cross section @xcite . if the two polarizations are linear , then the birefringence is induced by the elliptic deformation , and the linear mixing is induced by the twist , the xpm coefficient being @xmath40 in this case ( assuming that , as usual , the birefringence makes it possible to neglect four - wave mixing nonlinear terms @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the discrete model based on eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) with @xmath41 is exactly tantamount to a formal discretization of the above - mentioned continuum model which was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe a dual - core optical fiber with opposite signs of dispersion in the cores .",
    "another quite noteworthy feature of the present model is that , if @xmath39 , it turns out to be formally equivalent to a discretization of the standard bragg - grating model ( [ bg ] ) , which is produced by replacing @xmath42 and @xmath43 . indeed , making the substitution ( `` staggering transformation '' ) @xmath44 one concludes that the discrete version of eqs .",
    "( [ bg ] ) takes precisely the form of eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) with @xmath45 , and @xmath39 .      before proceeding to the presentation of numerical results for solitons found in the system of eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) , it is relevant to understand at which values of the propagation constant @xmath46 ( spatial frequency ) solitons with exponentially decaying tails may exist in this model .",
    "there are two regions in which they may be found .",
    "firstly , inside the gap of the system s linear spectrum one may find _ discrete gap solitons _ ,",
    "i.e. , counterparts of the gss found in the continuum version of the model in ref .",
    "secondly , solitons specific to the discrete model may be found _ above _ the phonon band . to analyze these possibilities , an asymptotic expression for the tail , @xmath47 is to be substituted into the linearized version of eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) .    investigating the possibility of the existence of solitons above the phonon gap",
    ", it is sufficient to focus on the particular case @xmath48 and @xmath49 , when the system s spectrum takes a simple form ( we have also considered more general cases with positive @xmath50 different from @xmath7 and @xmath51 , concluding that they do not yield anything essentially different from this case ) .",
    "the final result , produced by a straightforward algebra , is that solitons are possible in the region @xmath52 @xmath53 being edges of the phonon band . in what follows below",
    ", we will assume @xmath54 , as in this case positive and negative values of @xmath46 are equivalent .    to understand the possibility of the existence of the discrete gss , we , first , set @xmath48 as above , but keep the mismatch @xmath20 as an arbitrary parameter .",
    "then , the gap is easily found to be @xmath55 ( recall that , by definition , @xmath18 ) .",
    "an essential role of the mismatch parameter is that it makes the gap broader if it is negative .    in the more general case , @xmath56",
    ", two different layers can be identified in the gap , similar to what was found in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath49 , the _ inner _ and _ outer _ layers are @xmath57 ( in the case @xmath48 , the outer layer disappears ) .",
    "the difference between the layers is the same as in the continuum limit @xcite : in the outer layer , solitons , if any , have monotonically decaying tails , i.e. , real @xmath58 in eq . (",
    "[ tail ] ) , while in the inner layer @xmath58 is complex , and , accordingly , soliton tails are expected to decay with oscillations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we display results for solitons found above the phonon band , i.e. , in the region ( [ above_band ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the solitons is monitored , starting from the anti - continuum ( ac ) limit @xmath59 , and gradually increasing @xmath17 .",
    "any branch of soliton solutions in this region must disappear , approaching the continuum limit .",
    "indeed , as the radiation band ( frequently called `` phonon band '' , referring to linear phonon modes in the lattice dynamics ) becomes infinitely broad in this limit , see eq .",
    "( [ above_band ] ) , the solution branch with @xmath60 will crash hitting the swelling phonon band .",
    "however , in many cases the soliton of this type is found to remain stable _ as long as it exists _",
    ", so it may be easily observed experimentally in the optical array .    in section",
    "iii we present results for solitons existing inside the gap . in the outer layer [ which is defined as per eq .",
    "( [ innerouter ] ) , provided that @xmath56 ] , we were able to find only solitons of an `` antidark '' type , that sat on top of a nonvanishing background .",
    "however , in the inner layer [ recall it occupies the entire gap in the case @xmath48 , according to eq .",
    "( [ innerouter ] ) ] , true solitons are easily found ( in accord with the prediction , their tails decay with oscillations ) . in the case",
    "@xmath49 , these solutions appear as stable ones in the ac limit , get destabilized at some finite critical value of @xmath17 , and continue , as unstable solutions , all the way up to the continuum limit , never disappearing .",
    "it is quite interesting that sufficiently large negative mismatch _ strongly extends _ the stability range for these solitons .    as was mentioned above , the @xmath2 model based on eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) may be considered as a discretization of the standard gap - soliton system ( [ bg ] ) . in this connection , it is natural to search for discrete counterparts of the usual gss in the latter system .",
    "however , the discrete gss found in section iii do not have any counterpart in the continuum system ( [ bg ] ) , as the staggering transformation ( [ stagger ] ) makes direct transition from the discrete equations ( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) to the continuum system ( [ bg ] ) impossible . at the end of section iii ,",
    "we specially consider discrete solitons which are directly related to gss in the system ( [ bg ] ) .",
    "we find that such solitons exist indeed at all the values of @xmath17 , their drastic difference from those found in sections ii and iii is that they are essentially complex solutions to the stationary version of eqs .",
    "( [ zeq1 ] ) and ( [ zeq2 ] ) .",
    "at all finite values of @xmath17 , they are unstable , but the instability asymptotically vanishes in the ac and continuum limits , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    in section iv , we briefly consider the shg model ( [ jeq12 ] ) , ( [ jeq13 ] ) .",
    "solitons are found in this model too , and their stability is investigated .",
    "when the solitons are linearly unstable , the development of their instability is examined ( in all the sections ii , iii , and iv ) by means of direct numerical simulations , which show that the instability may initiate a transition to a localized breather , or to lattice turbulence , or , sometimes , complete decay of the soliton into lattice phonon waves .",
    "stationary solutions to eqs .",

    "the set of the resulting linearized equations for the perturbations @xmath69 is subsequently solved as an eigenvalue problem .",
    "this is done by using standard numerical linear algebra subroutines built into mathematical software packages @xcite .",
    "if all the eigenvalues @xmath68 are purely real , the solution is marginally stable ; on the contrary , the presence of a nonzero imaginary part of @xmath68 indicates that the soliton is unstable . when the solutions were unstable ,",
    "their dynamical evolution was followed by means of fourth - order runge - kutta numerical integrators , to identify the development and outcome of the corresponding instabilities .    in what follows below ,",
    "we describe different classes of soliton solutions , which are generated , in the ac limit , by expressions with different symmetries .",
    "still another class of solitons , which carries over into the usual gss in the continuum system ( [ bg ] ) , will be considered in the next section .",
