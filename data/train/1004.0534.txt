    "given the rapid current and expected growth in hspa and lte - based networks and in the number of mobile devices that use such networks to download data - intensive , multimedia - rich content , the need for qos - enabled connection management is vital .",
    "however , the non - uniform distribution of users and consequent imbalance in usage of radio resources leads to an existence of local areas of under- and over - utilization of these resources in the network .",
    "this phenomenon results in challenging network management issues .",
    "load balancing is an important technique that attempts to solve such issues , and occurs when a centralized network controller intelligently distributes connections from highly congested cells to neighboring cells which are less occupied .",
    "this allows for an increase in network subscriber satisfaction , as more subscribers meet their qos requirements .",
    "furthermore , it allows for an increase in overall channel utilization .",
    "load balancing is popular among the academic community and has been explored for many years as described , for example , in earlier works such as  @xcite , as well as more recently in  @xcite , and many other papers . for simplicity , in the previous treatment of load balancing",
    ", it has been assumed that the connection admission process can be neglected . in cellular networks",
    ", however , each new connection needs to first send a request to the serving base station ( bs ) through some predefined control channel . in 3gpp standards , this control channel is the physical random access channel  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.4.4.4 ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "the success of a connection request by a user is dependent on multiple factors including the number of requesting users ; the pairwise channel quality between the user and the serving base station ( measured , for example , in ber or outage probability ) ; and the actual control channel access technique itself  @xcite .",
    "until now the impact of random access overhead on load balancing performance is not well understood .",
    "more specifically , the quantitative relationship between the random access phase length and the user blocking probability in a load balancing - enabled cellular system is unknown .",
    "the present paper aims to provide a framework to address this gap .",
    "it provides a set of associated results that describe the benefits of load balancing in cellular networks in high detail , using realistic scenarios and network configurations . at the highest level",
    ", the approach is based on a markov model in which the state at each point in time provides a full description of user connectivity , and the transitions are determined by a range of factors described below .",
    "while many previous studies have also applied markov methods to model network traffic , the approach described here is differentiated from previous work in multiple respects .",
    "first , as noted , it incorporates the call admission process , i.e. the process of requesting a connection before the actual assignment of a bs resource .",
    "second , specific consideration is given to channel quality information , which in turn has a direct effect on the number of successful connections and terminations thereby having an impact on load balancing performance metrics .",
    "third , it incorporates priority differentiation in the load balancing process .",
    "we use the prioritization approach , where users that do not have access to multiple base stations get a higher priority in using available cell resources than users that do .",
    "more generally , the model allows substantial flexibility with respect to traffic types , admission control , densities of user population , and other parameters , but is also specifically constructed with the function of considering optimal network policy decisions with respect to load balancing .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is introduced in section  [ sec : system_model ] , while the analytical model is introduced in section  [ sec : numerical_analysis ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "lastly , the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a cellular system where two base stations ( bss ) are positioned such that they create a region of overlap in coverage . naturally , while cellular systems typically have far more than two bss , a reduction to a two - bs system for analytical reasons enables a tractable analytical framework while still allowing exploration of a large number of microscopic parameters to use in optimizing network performance . as our model",
    "is of microscopic nature , the extension to a multi - bs system is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we strongly emphasize that consideration of load balancing in the context of a two - bs system only has been used extensively and successfully in previous treatments , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "cell 1 has @xmath1 available basic bandwidth units , as referred to in  @xcite or more commonly referred to as channels , and cell 2 has @xmath2 available channels .",
    "the throughput of every channel in each cell is the same and equal to @xmath3bits / second .",
    "we assume that channels are mutually orthogonal and that there is no interference in the set of channels belonging to cells 1 and 2 .",
    "each bs emits a signal using omnidirectional antennas and we assume a circular contour signal coverage model , in which full signal strength is received within a certain radius of the bs , and no signal is available beyond that radius , as used in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "each mobile terminal , referred to as user equipment ( ue ) , remains at fixed positions following an initial ue placement process , with each ue located in one of three non - overlapping regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model ] .",
    "@xmath4 ues are in group 1 and have access only to one bs , @xmath5 ues are in group 2 and have access only to the second bs , and @xmath6 ues are in group 3 and can potentially access either bs .",
    "such a non - homogenous ue placement has been considered , for example in  @xcite , which allows for a tractable analysis of the considered system and considers all important groups participating in the load balancing process .",
    "the non - homogenous case of ue distribution is the most widespread because ues are generally distributed non - uniformly over a cellular area .",
    "ues in group 3 are in the region of overlap in coverage between the two cells , also known as the traffic transferable region ( ttr )  @xcite . since only one ue can occupy a channel at a time , a maximum of @xmath7 ues can be connected to both cells in the system at any given time .",
    "we assume that ues from groups 1 and 3 are initially registered to cell 1 ( serving as the overloaded cell ) , while ues in group 2 are initially registered to cell 2 .",
    "time is slotted and the minimum time unit is a frame length of @xmath8 seconds .",
    "connections and channel conditions are assumed to remain constant for the duration of a frame , though they will in general vary from frame to frame .",
    "moreover , we assume that the connection and termination processes for ues are directly dependent on the channel states experienced between each group of ues and the bss they are connected to .",
    "we also assume that channel states are binary and independent from slot to slot , much as occurs in  @xcite , and that all of the ues in each group experience the same channel quality to a given bs .",
    "therefore , in any given time slot a ue is either experiencing a good state with probability @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 denotes the particular pair - wise connection between group @xmath10 of ues and associated bs @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denotes the downlink and uplink , respectively ) , or a bad state , with probability @xmath13 .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is dependent on the distance between ues in group @xmath10 and bs @xmath11 , which is denoted as @xmath14 . in our analysis",
    "we use the distance as an input to a combined path loss and shadowing propagation model .          because of the strict boundaries between groups of ues",
    ", we assign priorities on a per group basis . a single ,",
    "higher priority is given to all ues in groups 1 and 2 because there is no flexibility to reassign them to a different bs ; group 3 ues can potentially be reassigned and thus given a lower priority . a very similar priority model has been used in other treatments of load balancing .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , newly arriving connections in the non - ttr are given first priority to acquire channels from their serving bss , while the connections from the ttr are assigned to the remaining channels .",
    "our model allows for the implementation of a wide range of scenarios that require such traffic prioritization .",
    "one potential application is for the modeling of networks where load balancing traffic originating from ues in the ttr has lower priority than non - balanced connections due to several factors including a lower average channel quality  @xcite , qos requirements  @xcite , non - uniform spatial distribution of traffic classes  @xcite , or cell dwell time . furthermore , it allows for modeling integrated hybrid cellular / wlan / ad hoc networks as discussed in  @xcite , where non - cellular terminals in the ttr have a lower priority than cellular ues , and hierarchical cellular systems  @xcite , where members of different tiers have independent priorities .",
    "finally , it enables the modeling of femtocell traffic prioritization , where ues in groups 1 and 3 are those in the closed subscriber group ( csg )  @xcite , while ues in the ttr are neighboring ues outside of the csg .      in the connection process a ue first attempts to connect to the bs it is initially registered to by requesting a connection through a random access channel .",
    "we assume a frequency division duplex transmission mode , where control and data traffic are transmitted and received simultaneously .",
    "each ue generates a connection request with probability @xmath15 .",
    "a connection is requested randomly in one of @xmath16 non - overlapping , time slotted control resources , unique to group @xmath17 of ues .",
    "in other words , each group has a unique set of sub slots within a frame during which ues may , but are not required to , request a connection .",
    "the random access phase length is equal to slot length @xmath8 .",
    "collisions between connection requests from ues in the same group are possible .",
    "the random access procedure considered in this work shares features of the 3gpp - based cellular network standards , which use the physical random access channel ( prach ) , mapped on a one - to - one basis to the logical random access channel ( rach ) .",
    "rach uses the s - aloha protocol and , in relation to the priorities assumed in this paper , allows the prioritization of connection requests based on active service classes ( asc )  @xcite which are unique to each ue , and can be adapted by the 3gpp - mac layer once the ue are in connected mode  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.4.2.6 ) .",
    "the bs advertises itself to the ues within range through the broadcast channel using signatures ( 3gpp release 99 , e.g. umts ) , subcarriers ( 3gpp release 8 , e.g. lte ) , or time slots , which each asc can in - turn use for connection requests on rach . the adaptation of the asc is performed in the time intervals predefined by the operator . for the purpose of our paper",
    "we assume that the bss collectively , through the radio network controller , map the received signal from every registered ue to an associated asc .",
    "we assume a zero - persistence protocol , i.e. a collision during a connection request implies that connections are lost , and also ues do not retry to generate another dependent connection . due to this assumption a power ramping process , i.e. feedback from the ue to the bs on an unsuccessful connection request  ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii - b ) , is redundant . to isolate the impact of each group of ues on collision rates ,",
    "we assume mutually exclusive rach resources assigned to each asc  ( * ? ? ?",
    "analysis of prach performance in isolation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a connection request is granted during the connection arrangement process if a good channel state occurs between the ue and its associated bs at the moment of the request , and if no collisions occur between multiple requests from different ues .",
    "once a connection is established , the bs randomly selects a channel and assigns the connected ue to it .",
    "the ue then begins to receive downlink data .",
    "ues terminate a connection with probability @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the average connection transfer size and @xmath20 is the average packet size given in bits .",
    "we assume that the transfer size is at least one frame long .",
    "a connection terminates either when a transmission completes , or when the channel is in a bad state during transmission .      in the case of a ue in group 3 ,",
    "if a connection request is successful and there are no resources available in cell 1 , we assume that the radio network controller performs load balancing by transferring the call from cell 1 to cell 2 . to avoid overloading cell 2 and protecting ues that are already registered to it , ues in group 3 can access a maximum of @xmath21 channels from cell 2 , where @xmath22 .",
    "ues in group 3 have access to an additional @xmath21 shared channels , therefore they have access to a total of @xmath23 channels .    using the nomenclature of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec . 2 and 3 )",
    "this load balancing scheme belongs to a class of direct load balancing schemes .",
    "it is closest in operation to direct retry  @xcite .",
    "since we allow at most @xmath21 available channels to offload traffic from cell 1 to cell 2 ( as in simple borrowing scheme  ( * ? ?",
    "2 ) ) we denote our scheme as _ direct retry with truncated offloading channel resource pool _ ( abbreviated as dr@xmath24 ) . with @xmath25",
    "our scheme reduces to classical direct retry , while for @xmath26 it reduces to a system in which no load balancing takes place .    in our model we do not use a take - back process .",
    "that is , once connections from group 3 are offloaded onto cell 2 , they remain connected to cell 2 during the transmission despite whether or not resources have been freed in cell 1 . in",
    "@xcite the authors remark that the take - back process , although more fair to cell 2 because it minimizes blocking at cell 2 , is not always advantageous to the network due to the high signaling load that accompanies it . additionally , as in  @xcite , we do not use queuing , so there is no consideration of a call give - up process  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we do not allow preemption of connections from the ttr by connections that have access to channels only from their respective bss .",
    "note that all variables introduced in this section , as well as all other variables used in this paper are summarized in table  [ tab : variables ] .",

    "once a ue successfully requests a connection from the serving bs , a downlink transmission is started provided that at least one free channel is available for the ue . the connection terminates when the bs finishes transmitting data to the ue or when the downlink signal received by the ue is in outage .",
    "the probability that @xmath64 connections from @xmath83 active connections at group @xmath10 terminate is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the inverse of the average packet length , accounting for truncation of some packets due to a bad channel quality .",

    "the transition probability is constructed using the termination and arrangement probability definitions and the respective relationship between the variables of these two definitions ( which are dependent on the start and end states of the transition ) . due to the complexity of the derivation we begin with a highly simplified example .      to facilitate understanding the derivation of the complete state transition probabilities , we first consider a network in which no load balancing occurs and all of the ues are in group 1 , such that @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the state of the markov chain then simplifies to @xmath90 and the transition probability becomes @xmath91 , where @xmath92 in ( [ eq : rat-1at ] ) the case",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 denotes the transition from a higher to a lower channel occupancy , subject to the constraint that the number of channels occupied in the end state can not exceed the total bs capacity .",
    "the number of terminating ues is set to compensate for the ues that generate successful connections .",
    "the case @xmath95 , @xmath94 denotes the transition from a lower to a higher channel occupancy ( given , again , that the number of occupied channels is less than the total bs capacity ) . in this case",
    "ues from group 1 need to generate exactly as many connections as given by the end state , not forgetting to generate connections in order to compensate for the total number of terminations .",
    "lastly , for the case of @xmath96 , @xmath97 the end state equals the total channel capacity .",
    "the first term in the definition of this transition probability includes exactly the number of connections needed to reach the end state , once again compensating for terminations .",
    "the second term accounts for all successful connections generated that exceed those needed to reach the end state , which will not be admitted .",
    "as expected , the current state of the ues in each group has a strong impact on the allowable future states in all groups .",
    "for example , newly generated connections from ues in group 2 are initially assigned to cell 1 and can only be offloaded to cell 2 once all channels on cell 1 are occupied .",
    "therefore , in the process of constructing the complete set of transition probabilities , not only is it necessary to enumerate all conditions that govern these possible transitions , as in ( [ eq : rat-1at ] ) , but it is also important to consider the relationship between the possible combinations of termination and arrangement probabilities .    before presenting the general solution , we introduce supporting functions that simplify the description of the transition probabilities .",
    "first , because the system is composed of three groups , where groups 1 and 2 have the same level of priority , we define a function that governs the transition probabilities for these groups , i.e. @xmath98 where @xmath99 when @xmath100 and @xmath101 , otherwise .",
    "variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 are supporting parameters that will be replaced by respective variables of ( [ eq : rabcd ] ) , once we derive general formulas for transition probabilities . the ranges of @xmath102 and @xmath103 will be defined in the respective transition probabilities shown later .",
    "note that ( [ eq : alpha ] ) resembles ( [ eq : rat-1at ] ) , except for the introduction of the indicator function @xmath104 .",
    "for the remaining groups , we define the following supporting functions which denote the possible termination probabilities for group 3 @xmath105 note that the termination probabilities for group 3 in ( [ eq : theta ] ) are composed of individual termination function as given in ( [ eq : tij ] ) .",
    "one reason for this is that different channel qualities are experienced by ues in the ttr , resulting in unequal termination probabilities , depending on whether these ues are connected to bs 1 or bs 2 .",
    "lastly , we define @xmath106 which denotes the possible arrangement probabilities for group 3 .",
    "note that the variables @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 in ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , ( [ eq : theta ] ) and ( [ eq : xi ] ) are the enumerators .",
    "given the above , we can identify two major states of the system as follows : when all channels are occupied on both cells ( called an edge state and having the same meaning as the last condition in ( [ eq : rat-1at ] ) ) ; and the remaining states .",
    "we start by describing the edge state conditions .",
    "here we list the following sub - cases . for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 or @xmath110 , @xmath114 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath115",

    "the first term in the brackets enumerates all the possible cases of terminations and generations in group 3 given a certain starting state . the second term in the brackets accounts for the edge case .",
    "this condition is similar in nature to the third case in ( [ eq : rat-1at ] ) .",
    "lastly , the remaining @xmath117 terms account for the possible transitions in group 1 and 2 .",
    "the indicator function used in the last condition of ( [ eq : alpha ] ) is a function of the termination and connection enumerators in group 3 . that is , depending on how many connections are admitted in bs 1 and bs 2 in a previous frame , a certain number of ues from group 1 and 2 that request connections will not be admitted .    for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath118 or @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath119 or @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath120 or @xmath110 , @xmath114 , @xmath121 we have @xmath122 in this case the number of connections from group 3 to both bs 1 and bs 2 decreases , or",
    "the number of connections in any one of the bss remains the same , while the other decreases .",
    "the construction of the transition probability is the same as in ( [ eq:13 ] ) , respectively replacing @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "note that the definition of @xmath124 in ( [ eq : theta ] ) defines the number of freed connections at bs 1 and bs 2 because of terminations of group 3 ues .",
    "since the number of connections have to be maintained at full cell occupancy for cell 1 and cell 2 , the respective functions @xmath125 for bs 1 and bs 2 , are used to compensate for the possible number of terminations at each cell due to group 3 ues in order to maintain full system - wide occupancy , i.e. to remain at the edge state .    for @xmath110",
    ", @xmath111 , @xmath126 or @xmath110 , @xmath114 , @xmath126 , @xmath115 @xmath127 this case describes the situation where the number of connections from group 3 ues to bs 1 strictly decreases , while those from group 3 ues to bs 2 strictly increases .",
    "the transition probability represented in ( [ eq:13 ] ) can account for this by replacing @xmath123 with @xmath128 .",
    "the definition of @xmath128 from ( [ eq : theta ] ) describes the case when the number of terminations at bs 1 from group 3 ues account for the decrease in the number of connections , while the number of terminations at bs 2 account only for any additional number of generations .",
    "the respective function @xmath125 for bs 1 and bs 2 , again , must compensate for the changes in connections from group 3 to bs 1 and bs 2 in order to maintain full - cell occupancy .",
    "lastly , for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath129 @xmath130 the above case is the opposite of that in ( [ eq:15 ] ) . here , the number of connections from group 3 to bs 1 strictly increases , while those from group 3 to bs 2 strictly decreases .",
    "again , respective expressions for @xmath123 in ( [ eq:13 ] ) need to be replaced by @xmath131 .",
    "the explanation for @xmath131 and @xmath125 given in ( [ eq : theta ] ) is equivalent to the explanation for ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "the second major group of cases refers to the situation in which the number of connections at bs 1 or bs 2 is less than or equal to the maximum capacity .",
    "this obviously involves more cases to consider than those explained in section  [ sec : a+b = m ] .",
    "we start by denoting conditions under which a transition from one state to another is not possible .",
    "that is , for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 or @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath136 , @xmath135 @xmath137 for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath138 @xmath139 the above case is partially equivalent to ( [ eq:13 ] ) and considers the situation where the number of connections of group 3 ues connected to bs 1 increases and those to bs 2 stay the same .",
    "also , the number of new connections at bs 1 is less than its maximum capacity .",
    "since this is not an edge case for the system , an additional third summation term is not needed as seen in ( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "note that this condition only contains one summation because the number of terminations from ues connected to bs 2 can not exceed the resultant connection state .",
    "this is because if they do exceed the desired number of terminations , ues that generate connections to compensate for additional terminations will instead choose to connect to bs 1 ( the bs they are registered to ) thereby changing the resultant connection state .",
    "now , for @xmath110 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 @xmath143 this case is an extension of the case described in ( [ eq:18 ] ) .",
    "however , full - cell occupancy now occurs at bs 1 , i.e. all channels of bs 1 are occupied after the transition , and bs 2 operates at less than its maximum capacity .",
    "an additional summation is used as compared to ( [ eq:18 ] ) because full - cell occupancy on bs 1 allows for terminations to occur on bs 2 from group 3 ues without changing their resultant connection number .",

    "given the complete description of the system , we are able to derive important metrics that would describe the efficiency of the load balancing process involving connection admission . while there are many performance metrics that can be extracted given the above framework , we focus on three primary metrics : ( i ) the blocking probability , which describes the probability that at least one ue which requests a connection from a particular group will be denied access to a channel , ( ii ) the channel utilization , which expresses the fraction of the available channels are being used , and ( iii ) the collision probability on a control channel , which provides the probability that at least one requesting connection will be lost due to a collision with another ue .      as used here",
    ", blocking occurs when at least one ue requests a new connection , but can not be admitted to any bs due to lack of available channels .",
    "since each group has access to a different number of channels and can follow a different connection strategy , it is necessary to define separate blocking probability metrics for ues in groups 1 and 2 , as contrasted with ues in group 3 . for groups 1 and 2 ,",
    "the blocking probability is defined according to @xmath153 where for @xmath154 @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and for @xmath158 @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 . for group",

    "we briefly explain the above equations . the derivation of the blocking probability for group 3 ues is more complicated than for those ues in groups 1 and 2 because this group can access channels from both cells",
    "therefore , the number of generations for group 3 ues that leads to blocking has to account for the terminations within the same group , and also for the possible changes in the number of connections of ues in groups 1 and 2 .    the blocking for group 3 ues",
    "can be analyzed in two separate cases .",
    "the first case accounts for the number of generations needed to occupy all the channels in cell 1 ( @xmath25 ) , while the second case accounts for the number of generations needed to occupy all available channels in cell 2 ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "the first case is simpler to analyze because group 3 ues need only generate as many connections as there are available resources on cell 1 .    when @xmath181 , group 3 ues can only access a maximum of @xmath21 channels on cell 2",
    ". therefore , extra conditions are added for the situation in which group 3 ues are blocked when exceeding @xmath21 connections in cell 2 .",
    "if there are less than @xmath21 available free channels after terminations of group 3 ues connected to cell 2 , the function @xmath182 represents the number of connections to cause blocking by generating the exact number of connections to occupy all available channels .",
    "the @xmath182 function is used to lower bound the necessary number of connections for blocking .",
    "this is because the number of connections on cell 2 , in general , is not restricted to @xmath21 and can thus have more than @xmath21 current occupancies resulting in a possibly negative value for @xmath183 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are more than @xmath21 available channels after terminations , exactly @xmath21 channels are used by group 3 ues to cause blocking .",
    "the overall channel utilization is @xmath184 which refers to the fraction of the collective capacity that has been used by all ues in all groups .",

    "this is equivalent to varying @xmath194 from a location that is out of range to being right next to bs 1 , and setting @xmath195 m .",
    "we use the pathloss model with the following parameters : @xmath196dbm , @xmath197dbm , @xmath198db , @xmath199db , @xmath200 m and",
    "lastly @xmath201 .",
    "furthermore , we assume an average channel capacity of @xmath202kbps per channel with an average packet size @xmath203 kb and @xmath204ms slot length .",
    "this yields an average packet length of @xmath205 frames , or equivalently 250ms .",
    "the channel throughput represents a typical value used in radio access network planning calculations  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the packet size represents a realistic packet length sent over the internet  @xcite , where packets are distributed between a minimum value of 40b ( transport control protocol acknowledgement packet ) and a maximum transmission unit , which for ipv6 equals 1.268 kb , for ieee 802.3 equals 1.492 kb , for ethernet ii equals 1.5 kb , and for ieee 802.11 equals 2.272 kb .    .",
    "two extremes of shared channels , i.e. @xmath26 ( no load balancing ) and @xmath206 ( all of cell 2 s channels used in load balancing ) are shown .",

    "as expected , the channel utilization increases with more traffic intensity because an increase in @xmath208 results in more frequent connection requests from ues in all groups leading to a higher probability of successful connections . the increase in channel utilization tails off as the system reaches saturation , i.e. close to 100% channel utilization .",
    "similarly , an increase in @xmath21 results in a higher channel utilization as more ues from group 3 , that are blocked from cell 1 , are offloaded onto cell 2 where they have access to an additional @xmath21 channels .",
    "we observe that there is a decreasing rate of gain in channel utilization with an increase in the number of shared channels @xmath21 . as fig .",
    "[ fig : chan_util ] shows , a traffic intensity of @xmath209 results in the most improvement in channel utilization between the two extremes of @xmath26 , and @xmath206 . with the knowledge of decreasing gains in channel utilization with increasing @xmath21 , there",
    "may exist an intermediate value of @xmath21 that not only leads to an improvement in total channel utilization , but also maximizes improvement with respect to the overall ue experience .",
    "this value of @xmath21 is explored in section  [ sec : varying_k ] . in the current section",
    "we continue our investigation using @xmath209 and explore the impacts of channel quality on performance .     for two extreme values of @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath191 improves , more group 3 ues generate successful connections to cell 1 resulting in more ues that connect to bs 1 and consequently are offloaded onto cell 2 , resulting in an overall increase in channel utilization . ]",
    "[ fig : chan_util_w31 ] illustrates an increase in channel utilization with an increase in @xmath191 for two extreme values of @xmath21 . increasing @xmath191 results in group 3 ues having more successful requests for receiving downlink transmissions because the average channel quality , in which requests are granted for group 3 ues , improves .",
    "therefore , ignoring the channel effects by assuming perfect channel conditions ( also done by setting @xmath210 in our model ) in the analysis of load - balancing schemes , even for one particular group of ues , produces a non - trivial difference in the channel utilization and leads to an exaggerated improvement in performance due to load balancing . by selecting a reasonable scheme to determine the channel quality , as presented in section  [ sec : outage_probability ] , we are able to provide a more realistic evaluation of the improvements of load balancing .",
    "note that the average channel utilization significantly increases as more channels can be borrowed from bs 2 .",
    "when @xmath191 increases , the difference in channel utilization between cases @xmath26 and @xmath211 becomes more profound .",
    "this proves that with the low channel quality system - wide improvement from load balancing might not be as significant as in the case of perfect channel conditions .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : incr_w31_k=3 ] we observe the impact of an increasing number of shared channels on the considered performance benchmarks .",
    "the first interesting observation is that irrespective of the value of @xmath21 the blocking probability for group 1 ues , @xmath214 , is relatively stable .",
    "this means that the quality of service requirements for ues not involved in load balancing will be met , even with load balancing enabled .",
    "second , as @xmath21 increases , blocking probability for group 3 ues , @xmath212 , significantly decreases , which proves the effectiveness of load balancing in this context .",
    "furthermore , the collision probability for ues in group 3 , @xmath213 , also reduces because with more shared channels there are fewer unconnected ues to request connections .",
    "note , however , that the difference in collision probability for an increasing @xmath21 is not as significant as observed for the blocking probability .",
    "finally , increasing @xmath21 only slightly increases blocking probability @xmath215 because these ues have priority in connecting to any of cell 2 s free channels .    focusing on fig .",
    "[ fig : incr_w31_k=3 ] only , where load balancing is enabled , we note that as @xmath217 increases , all curves experience an increase . this can be explained as follows : with an increase in @xmath191 , more group 3 ues are able to generate successful connections to bs 1 resulting in an increase in the contention for sub slots during admission control , and hence an increase in @xmath213 .",
    "also , there is an accompanied increase in @xmath212 because as more ues generate successful connections , an increasing number of ues contend for free channels on both cell 1 ( where load balancing does not occur ) and cell 2 ( where load balancing occurs ) .",

    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : blocking_tot_p ] .    the most interesting observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : blocking_tot_p ] is that with an increase in the number of ues in the ttr , the total blocking probability becomes smaller for moderate values of @xmath208 .",
    "surprisingly , the blocking probability starts to drop sharply as the value of @xmath208 continues to increase .",
    "this phenomenon occurs because as @xmath208 increases , so do collisions on the random access channel , which in - turn limits the blocking probability because there are fewer ues that successfully access available channels .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that for each case presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : blocking_tot_p ] the length of the random access phase remains the same .",
    "what is important to note is that for moderate values of @xmath208 , the difference between blocking probabilities for each case is small , i.e. less than 5% ( please compare values of blocking probability for each case in the range of @xmath228 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath208 becomes very large , the curves with a higher number of group 3 ues drop off faster because they experience a substantial increase in the number of collisions . therefore",
    ", a certain value of @xmath208 can maximize the channel utilization achieved through load balancing and also maintain the blocking probability at approximately the same level ( given negligible changes in ue distribution ) .",
    "we now move our focus to the impact of random access phase length @xmath66 on the performance of load balancing .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : varying_l ] .",
    "the set of parameters remain the same as in the earlier experiment in this section , however @xmath229 . as an example , three network metrics are evaluated as a function of number of slots in the random access phase , @xmath66 : ( i ) total channel utilization in both cells , @xmath230 , ( ii ) collision probability at group 3 , @xmath213 , and ( iii ) blocking probability at group 3 , @xmath212 . for clarity , the number of slots is set equal among each group of ues .    obviously , as the number of random access slots increase the collision probability decreases for group 3 ues , and the overall channel utilization increases .",
    "however , as the collision probability decreases the blocking probability , within the same group of ues , becomes larger .",
    "this is in line with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : blocking_tot_p ] .",
    "recall , that as more ues gain access to the bs , the probability that channels become unavailable increases .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : varying_l ] further demonstrate the fundamental tradeoff between the delay caused by random access and overall network utilization .",
    "apart from this tradeoff , we demonstrate that the network operator has a powerful tool , i.e. random access phase length , through which network metrics can be easily regulated .",
    "it is obvious that the operator has no control over the channel access probability , @xmath208 , of individual ues .",

    "<S> we present an analytical framework for modeling a priority - based load balancing scheme in cellular networks based on a new algorithm called direct retry with truncated offloading channel resource pool ( dr@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model differs in many respects from previous works on load balancing . </S>",
    "<S> foremost , it incorporates the call admission process , through random access . in specific , the proposed model implements the physical random access channel used in 3gpp network standards . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the proposed model allows the differentiation of users based on their priorities . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative results illustrate that , for example , cellular network operators can control the manner in which traffic is offloaded between neighboring cells by simply manipulating the length of the random access phase . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis allow to quantitatively determine the blocking probability individual users will experience given a specific length of random access phase . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe that the improvement in blocking probability per shared channel for load balanced users using dr@xmath0 is maximized at an intermediate number of shared channels , as opposed to the maximum number of these shared resources . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because a balance is achieved between the number of users requesting connections and those that are already admitted to the network . </S>"
