    "these results show that the ddi  can be used to split one exciton into two excitons , and also to control the electromagnetically - induced transparency phenomenon .    in fig .",
    "3 we have investigated the effect of the photonic crystal on the energy absorption rate in the lambda - type qd . initially , the lower band edge of the photonic crystal lies far away from the resonance energies of the qd ( see solid curve ) , and there is weak coupling between the qd and photonic crystal . when we move the lower band edge closer to the resonance frequency @xmath192 of the qd , the two peaks in the power absorption spectrum merge into a broad peak with a narrow electromagnetically - induced transparency window at @xmath185 ( see dashed curve ) .",
    "note also that the height of the peaks decreases .",
    "the merging of the split peaks in the qd power absorption spectrum occurs because the spontaneous decay rates become larger than  the ddi splitting for the two peaks .",
    "the value of the decay rate is large because the photonic density of states is large when the resonance energy of the qd lies near the band edges .",

    "this means that the hybrid system can be used to study the nonlinear properties of photonic crystals .",
    "using an external pump field to induce a large kerr nonlinearity in the polystyrene photonic crystal is also an effective way to switch the energy transfer between two states ; from high to low energy transfer peaks .",
    "alternatively , the refractive index of the background material in the photonic crystal can also be modified by immersing the photonic crystal in another material .",
    "therefore the present qd - graphene system can also be used as a nano - sensor .",
    "we now investigate the energy transfer rate from the qd to graphene , and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "4 as a function of probe detuning when the qd - graphene  separation @xmath137 is varied .",
    "we find that the power transfer spectrum has a single peak with a narrow electromagnetically - induced transparency  window when @xmath137 is large ( i.e. @xmath183 nm ) .",
    "when the  qd is brought closer to graphene  ( i.e. @xmath184 nm ) , the power transfer spectrum has one large minima and two peaks with separation proportional to the ddi .",
    "this indicates that energy is transferred from the qd to the graphene when the two dressed excitons created in the qd are absorbed by graphene .",
    "this is an interesting finding , and can be used to transfer energy absorbed by the qdfrom a light source ( i.e. the sun ) to graphene where it can be stored .",

    "this effect has been observed experimentally by chen et al.@xmath15 and dong et al.@xmath16 they found that as the distance between cdte - qds and a graphene oxide sheet decreases there is a strong quenching of the qd fluorescence .",
    "they concluded that the fluorescence quenching could be due the energy transfer from the qd to the graphene sheet .",
    "for example , chen et al.@xmath15 deposited graphene on quartz substrates and then cdse / zns - qds were deposited on graphene .",
    "the fluorescence measurements were performed on the individual qds located both on the bare quartz substrate and on a graphene layer .",
    "they observed strong fluorescence quenching for qds deposited on the graphene sheet , which was attributed to the energy transfer between qd and graphene and not due to photoinduced electron transfer from the qd to graphene .",

    "qds on graphene and observed a strong quenching of photoluminescence for these qds due to the presence of the graphene sheet .",
    "they also performed transient photovoltaic experiments on their hybrid systems and found a very unexpected strong positive photovoltaic response due to the ddi .",
    "conversely , it was found that separate samples of graphene and cds - qds of a similar size do not show any photovoltaic response .",
    "they concluded their experimental findings can be explained due to the energy transfer between the qd and the graphene sheet .",
    "similar energy transfer between a qd and carbon nanotube has also been found experimentally by shafran et al .. @xmath203    when a qd is in contact with biomolecules , molecular beacons , dna or aptamers , its dielectric constant can be modified .",
    "therefore we have investigated the role of the dielectric constant of the qd on the energy transfer to graphene .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "5a for three values of @xmath39 .",
    "it is found that by changing the dielectric constant of the qd , the height of the energy transfer peaks can be modified .",
    "for example by increasing or decreasing the dielectric constant the height of the energy transfer spectra decreases or increases , respectively .",
    "this is because the the energy transfer is inversely proportional to the square of the dielectric constant , as shown in eq .",
    "this effect has also been verified experimentally by dong et al.,@xmath16 where upon integrating a molecular beacon to a cdte - qd it was found that the fluorescence quenching due to graphene is modified .",
    "we also note that at certain values of probe detuning , say for example @xmath204 @xmath153ev , the sensitivity of the energy transfer rate to the change in dielectric constant is quite high .",
    "this is an interesting finding , particularly if one considers that the present hybrid system can be used to fabricate nano - biosensors .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the number of graphene layers on the energy transfer  spectrum . in fig .",
    "5b we have plotted the energy transfer rate to graphene when a single graphene layer or two layers are considered . here",
    "the ratio @xmath205 is preserved in order to keep the surface plasmon polariton resonance frequency constant .",
    "note that for two layers of graphene the height of the energy transfer peak increases .",
    "as we add additional layers of graphene , we increase its volume . in turn , the ddi between the qd and graphene is enhanced . therefore , both the height of the peaks in the energy transfer spectrum and their splitting",
    "are increased .",
    "this effect has also been verified experimentally by chen et al.@xmath15 , where it was found that increasing the number of graphene layers in a cdse / zns nanocrystal - graphene composite system enhanced the qd fluorescence quenching effect .",
    "we now consider an alternative configuration for the qd - graphene nanocomposite system where both transitions @xmath206 and @xmath207 couple with the surface plasmons in the graphene nanodisk . in this configuration",
    "we consider that both @xmath208 and @xmath31 are close to @xmath165 and the transition dipole moments ( fields ) @xmath30 ( probe field ) and @xmath32 ( control field ) are aligned along the @xmath20- and @xmath21-directions , respectively . in fig .",
    "6a we have plotted the energy transfer rate from the qd to grapheneas a function of the probe field detuning while varying @xmath137 . here",
    "the physical parameters are the same as considered in our previous calculations .",
    "note that we see two peaks due to the ddi effect as in the first configuration .",
    "previously the two peaks were symmetric , but in this case they are asymmetric .",
    "this is due to the self - induced ddi parameter @xmath209 , which causes both peaks to shift towards positive detuning due to the change in the effective probe detuning from @xmath210 to @xmath211 @xmath212 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ rho_12 ] ) . here",
    "also the width of both peaks increases due to the non - radiative decay @xmath213 .",
    "in the previous configuration the self - induced ddi parameter @xmath214 was zero because there was no coupling between the qd  transition @xmath215 and graphene.these effects are enhanced by decreasing @xmath137 .    in fig .",
    "6b the effect of the photonic crystal is investigated in the same way as in fig . 3 , and similar results are found as for the previous configuration . by applying an external pump laser field to the polystyrene photonic crystal , the power transfer to graphene can be switched from high to low values .",
    "we note that due to the asymmetry of the power transfer spectrum in this configuration , the sensitivity of this switching effect can change drastically depending on the value of probe field detuning .",
    "for example , negative detunings close to @xmath185 show a sharp peak in the energy transfer spectrum when the pump field is absent , and this peak is suppressed when the pump field is applied .",
    "finally , we investigate the energy absorption rate in a ladder - type qdcoupled with the graphene nanodisk . the formulation for this system is given in the appendix .",
    "we consider the case where the control field is coupled with the qd  transition @xmath216 and the graphene nanodisk , while the probe field is only coupled to the qd transition @xmath217 . here",
    "the resonance frequency @xmath218 lies near @xmath165 , while @xmath29 is uncoupled from both @xmath165 and @xmath219 .",
    "this situation is analogous to that explored in fig . 2 for the lambda - type qd .",
    "7 the energy absorption rate in the ladder - type qd is plotted when the qd - graphene nanodisk separation @xmath137 is varied .",
    "we find that the power absorption spectrum gives two peaks and a minimum when @xmath137 is small ( i.e. @xmath220 nm ) , as was found in fig .",
    "2 . note that for the ladder - type qd , the narrow minima due to electromagnetically induced transparency does not appear .",
    "this is because the same electromagnetically induced transparency effect does not appear in ladder - type systems.@xmath106 we have also investigated the effect of the photonic crystal on the energy absorption rate in the ladder - type qd , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "again we consider that a pump field of intensity @xmath221 gw / cm@xmath1 is applied , which causes the photonic crystal band edge to shift and increases the decay rate of the qd .",
    "note that the power absorption spectrum merges into a broad peak in the same way as it did for the lambda - type qd ( see fig .",
    "3b ) . here , however , the narrow minima present in the lambda - type qd is absent and we clearly see two peaks merging into one .",
    "we have investigated the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) and energy transfer in a quantum dot ( qd)-graphene nanodisk system embedded within a photonic crystal .",
    "our simulations predict that in this system , multiple excitonic states ( dressed states ) can be created in the quantum dot and then transferred to graphene with different frequencies .",
    "this phenomenon occurs purely due to the ddi between the qd and graphene , and results in energy transfer .",
    "we have demonstrated that the energy absorption of the qd  and/or the energy transfer from the qd to graphene can be switched on and off by changing the strength of the ddi or by applying an intense external field to the photonic crystal .",
    "we have also verified our findings qualitatively with recent experimental data on energy transfer in qd - graphene nanocomposite systems .",
    "our numerical results provide motivation for future experimental and theoretical investigations on nanocomposites made from graphene , carbon nanotubes , quantum dots and photonic crystals .",
    "the present theory can be applied to hybrid systems consisting of graphene with quantum emitters such as quantum dots , nanocrystals , atoms and chemical or biological molecules ; the only requirement is the quantum emitter should have at least three states .",
    "the proposed nanocomposite system can be used to fabricate nano - sensors , all optical nano - switches , energy transfer devices and energy storage devices .",
    "we consider a three - level quantum dot in the ladder configuration , where @xmath92 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the ground , first excited and second excited states , respectively .",
    "the probe field with amplitude @xmath178 and frequency @xmath222 is coupled between states @xmath27 and @xmath223 , while the control field with amplitude @xmath176 and frequency @xmath224 is coupled between states @xmath225 and @xmath94 .",
    "the decay of level @xmath223 to level @xmath27 ( level @xmath24 to level @xmath23 ) is given as @xmath226 ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "using the same methods as for the lambda - type system , the density matrix equations of motion for the ladder - type energy level configuration are then obtained as@xmath228where@xmath229and@xmath230 in the above expressions , all quantities are the same as given previously for the lambda - type system but with the substitutions @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "the qd energy absorption rate and the power transfer in this system are calculated using eqs .",
