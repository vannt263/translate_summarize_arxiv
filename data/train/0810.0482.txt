    "the ideal bose gas ( ibg ) is a well studied topic in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite since it provides invaluable qualitative insights on the properties of realistic bosonic systems .",
    "its thermodynamics properties can be explicitly worked out and have been intensively studied both in the thermodynamical limit and in finite systems @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "the study of the ibg has more than just academic interest since recent progresses in manipulating cold atomic systems @xcite allow for a reliable control of the relative strength of the kinetic and interaction energies : for instance , the possibilities of varying the scattering length through feshbach resonances @xcite and superimposing optical lattices ( obtaining effective lattice hamiltonians @xcite ) provide a tool for testing a bose gas from the strongly interacting regime to the ( almost ) non - interacting one . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that it is possible to tune the @xmath5-wave scattering length @xmath6 of a @xmath7rb bose gas with high precision , and set it almost to zero @xcite : this allows for long - lived bloch oscillations in an optical lattice @xcite and allows one to perform atom interferometry @xcite .",
    "when an optical lattice is superimposed to an ibg , for large values of the laser power , the system is described by a tight - binding bosonic model .",
    "the ibg has also been used to understand the effect of disorder @xcite and the role played by confining , tailorable external potentials , relevant in investigations of trapped ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "the effects of controllable or random impurities is again motivated by the huge progresses made on the manipulation of ultracold bosonic gases culminated in the recent experimental observation of anderson localization for matter waves in a random potential @xcite . in a bose gas , disorder can be induced both by a laser speckle @xcite ( i.e. , a laser beam is shone through a diffusive plate and superimposed to the trapping potential ) or by an incommensurate bichromatic potential @xcite ( i.e. , an auxiliary lattice is added to the main lattice , with an incommensurate ratio between the two frequencies ) .",
    "random on - site disorder in the strongly interacting limit induces a bose glass phase @xcite , whose characterization has been the object of many theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations . finally , ultracold atoms are a good experimental setup for studying superfluidity in random environments , which is an issue related to the adsorption of @xmath8he in porous media @xcite .",
    "the ibg is very interesting also in relation with statistical mechanics models : indeed , the ibg is in the universality class @xcite of the spherical model ( sm ) @xcite , which displays a phase transition in dimensions larger or equal than three .",
    "the sm is solvable in any dimension also with an external magnetic field @xcite , and it provides an interesting laboratory to investigate a variety of topics , such as long - range interactions @xcite and finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is the @xmath9 limit of the @xmath10 model @xcite , and , thus , is the leading term of @xmath11 expansions @xcite . with disorder",

    "it is shown that the critical temperature decreases with disorder : as we shall see , the lattice computation reproduces this behaviour for small filling , but , on the lattice , different behaviours are possible as a result of the interplay between discreteness and disorder . indeed , on a lattice , there are two competing effects since disorder broadens the distribution of the delocalized eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) and further localizes the ground - state wavefunction : the former ( latter ) effect tends to lower ( increase ) the critical temperature . for @xmath2 ( i.e. , infinite - range model ) ,",
    "the analysis can be carried analytically and one finds that the two effects exactly balance at large filling while , for small filling , the critical temperature decreases .",
    "for @xmath3 the balance is obtained for intermediate filling while , at large ( small ) filling , the critical temperature increases ( decreases ) ; the numerical coefficient that , for small disorder and large filling , determines the critical temperature increase is much smaller for random on - site disorder .",
