    "recently , babichev and fabbri  @xcite have shown that the massive linearized equation around the schwarzschild black hole in both de rham , gabadadze , and tolley ( drgt ) theory  @xcite and its bigravity extension  @xcite gives rise to an instability of @xmath0-mode ( spherically symmetric mode ) with @xmath1 the spheroidal harmonic index .",
    "this was done by comparing it with the four - dimensional linearized equation around the five - dimensional black string where the gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability was found  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the bimetric black hole is unstable provided a mass of @xmath2 satisfies a bound of @xmath3 with @xmath4 the horizon radius in the metric function @xmath5 .",
    "we note that the limit of @xmath6 recovers the black hole in the drgt theory .",
    "the black hole in the drgt theory is also unstable because @xmath7 satisfies a bound of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the authors  @xcite have confirmed this result by considering the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole and extending the @xmath9 mode to generic modes of @xmath10 .",
    "these results may indicate an important fact that the static black holes do not exist in massive gravity theory .    on the other hand ,",
    "whitt  @xcite has insisted thirty years ago that provided both massive spin-0 and spin-2 gravitons are non - tachyonic , the schwarzschild black hole is classically stable in a massive theory of fourth - order gravity when he uses the linearized - ricci tensor equation . in this case , one does not worry about the ghost instability arising from the fourth - order gravity theory because the linearized - ricci tensor satisfies a second - order tensor equation .",
    "recently , the author has revisited this stability issue .",
    "as expected , it was shown that the black hole in fourth - order gravity with @xmath11 is unstable provided the graviton mass of @xmath12 satisfies a bound of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this was performed by comparing the linearized - ricci tensor equation with the four - dimensional metric perturbation equation around the five - dimensional black string  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we wish to reexamine the classical stability of schwarzschild - ads ( sads ) black hole in einstein - weyl gravity which was known to be stable against the metric perturbation  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , it is shown that solving both the linearized - einstein tensor equation and the metric perturbation equation exhibit unstable modes featuring the gl instability of five - dimensional ads black string  @xcite .",
    "it confirms that the gl instability of the black hole in the einstein - weyl gravity is due to the massiveness but not a feature of fourth - order gravity giving ghost states .",
    "taking into account the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) , it is helpful to show why the sads black hole is physically stable in the einstein gravity  @xcite , whereas the sads black hole is unstable in the einstein - weyl gravity .",
    "the number of dof of the metric perturbation is 2 in the einstein gravity , while the number of dof is 5 in the einstein - weyl gravity .",
    "the @xmath14-mode analysis of the massive graviton with @xmath15 dof shows the gl instability .",
    "the @xmath14-mode analysis is relevant to the massive graviton in the einstein - weyl gravity but not to the massless graviton in the einstein gravity .",
    "we start with the fourth - order gravity in ads@xmath16 spacetimes @xmath17 \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with two arbitrary parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "although this theory is renormalizable in minkowski spacetimes  @xcite , the massive spin-2 graviton suffers from having ghosts .",
    "a massive spin-0 graviton is decoupled for the choice of @xmath11 , which leads to a critical gravity with @xmath20  @xcite . for a higher dimensional critical gravity ,",
    "see a reference of @xcite .",
    "the einstein - weyl gravity is defined under the condition of @xmath11 as @xmath21 \\label{ewaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 here the last of gauss - bonnet term could be neglected because it does not contribute to equation of motion .    from ( [ action ] )",
    ", the einstein equation is derived to be @xmath23 where the einstein tensor is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 takes the form @xmath26 it is wellknown that eq.([equa1 ] ) provides the sads black hole solution  @xcite @xmath27 with the metric function @xmath28 here @xmath29 denotes the curvature radius of ads@xmath16 spacetimes .",
    "we note that a mass parameter of @xmath30 is not the horizon radius @xmath31 which is obtained as a solution to @xmath32 .",
    "hereafter we denote the background quantities with the `` overbar '' . in this case , the background ricci tensor is given by @xmath33 it is easy to show that the sads black hole solution ( [ sch ] ) to the einstein equation of @xmath34 is also the solution to the einstein - weyl gravity when one substitutes ( [ beeq ] ) together with @xmath35 into ( [ equa2 ] ) . to perform the stability analysis , we usually introduce the metric perturbation around the sads black hole @xmath36 then , the linearized einstein equation takes the form @xmath37\\delta g _ { \\mu\\nu}&+&\\alpha\\big[\\bar{\\nabla}^2\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}+2\\bar{r}_{\\rho\\mu\\sigma\\nu}\\delta g^{\\rho\\sigma}-\\frac{2\\lambda}{3 } \\delta r \\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu}\\big ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( \\alpha+2\\beta)\\big[-\\bar{\\nabla}_\\mu\\bar{\\nabla}_\\nu+\\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu}\\bar{\\nabla}^2 + \\lambda \\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu}\\big ] \\delta r=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the linearized einstein tensor , ricci tensor , and ricci scalar are given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "it is very difficult to solve the linearized equation ( [ lin - eq ] ) directly because it is a coupled second - order equation for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we attempt to decouple @xmath41 from ( [ lin - eq ] ) .    for this purpose ,",
    "we take the trace of ( [ lin - eq ] ) which leads to @xmath42\\delta r=0.\\ ] ] it implies that the dalembertian operator could be removed if one chooses @xmath43 in this case , the linearized ricci scalar is constrained to vanish @xmath44 plugging @xmath45 into eq .",
    "( [ lin - eq ] ) leads to the equation for the linearized einstein tensor solely @xmath46 this shows clearly why we consider the einstein - weyl gravity ( [ ewaction ] ) with @xmath11 instead of the fourth - order gravity action ( [ action ] ) with arbitrary @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "before we proceed , we wish to mention that the metric perturbation is not suitable for analyzing the sads black hole stability in the einstein - weyl gravity . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the ads@xmath16 spacetimes background whose curvature tensor takes a simple form @xmath47 after choosing the transverse - traceless gauge ( ttg ) @xmath48 eq .",
    "( [ slin - eq ] ) leads to a fourth - order differential equation  @xcite @xmath49 which may imply a massless spin-2 graviton equation @xmath50 and a massive spin-2 graviton equation @xmath51 here the mass squared is given by @xmath52 in ads@xmath16 spacetimes , the stability condition is given by the absence of tachyonic instability ( @xmath53 )  @xcite , which implies that @xmath19 must satisfy @xmath54 in the massless case of @xmath55 , eq.([four - eq ] ) leads to that for a critical gravity @xmath56 however , it was shown that a general mode of @xmath57 suffers from negative norm states unless one truncates out the log - mode by imposing appropriate ads@xmath16 boundary conditions .",
    "up to now , there is no consistent truncation mechanism to eliminate the log - mode .",
    "we recall that this problem arises because we work with the fourth - order derivative equation ( [ four - eq ] ) for the metric perturbation . in this work",
    ", we do not consider a new unitary gravity for @xmath58  @xcite because it has still a non - unitarity problem like the critical gravity .",
    "going back to the sads black hole ( [ sch ] ) , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ slin - eq ] ) as a second - order equation for the linearized einstein tensor @xmath59 if one introduces the lichnerowicz operator @xmath60 the corresponding equation could be rewritten as @xmath61 taking into account the ttg ( [ ttg ] ) , the linearized einstein tensor reduces to @xmath62 then , one can rewrite ( [ g - eq ] ) as a fourth - order equation for @xmath63 @xmath64 which is similar to ( [ four - eq ] ) in ads@xmath16 spacetimes .",
    "( [ four - eqq ] ) may imply a linearized massless equation around the sads black hole  @xcite @xmath65 and a linearized massive equation for @xmath66 @xmath67    at this stage , we wish to point out the difference between ( [ se1m - eq ] ) and ( [ lem2-eq ] ) .",
    "the former equation is a second - order equation for the linearized einstein tensor , whereas the latter is a suggesting second - order equation from the fourth - order equation ( [ four - eqq ] ) for the metric perturbation .",
    "it is known that the introduction of fourth - order derivative terms gives rise to ghost - like massive graviton  @xcite , which may imply an instability of a black hole even if a black hole solution exists .",
    "hence , even though ( [ se1-eq])[([se2-eq ] ) ] were frequently used as a linearized massless [ massive ] equation around the ads@xmath16 spacetimes  @xcite , their validity is not yet proved because they are free from ghost states . in order to check",
    "whether ( [ se2-eq])[([lem2-eq ] ) ] are reliable or not , we note that our action ( [ ewaction ] ) reveals ghosts when we perform the metric perturbation @xmath63 around the minkowski spacetimes with @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "( [ four - eq])[([four - eqq ] ) ] take the form in the minkowski background  @xcite @xmath69 with an external source @xmath70 . replacing @xmath71 by @xmath72 ,",
    "the metric perturbation is given by @xmath73 which the last term spoils the unitarity .",
    "hence , splitting ( [ four - eq])[([four - eqq ] ) ] into two second - order equations ( [ se1-eq])[([lem1-eq ] ) ] and ( [ se2-eq])[([lem2-eq ] ) ] is dangerous because the ` @xmath74 ' sign in the front of ( [ se2-eq])[([lem2-eq ] ) ] is missed . as is shown in ( [ h - s ] ) , the ghost arises from this sign when one performs the partial fraction . to this end",
    ", the authors in  @xcite have found the two on - shell energies on the ads@xmath16 spacetime background @xmath75 when they compute each hamiltonian which satisfies ( [ se1-eq ] ) and ( [ se2-eq ] ) , respectively .",
    "thus , for @xmath76 , ghost - like massive excitation is not avoidable . in order for the theory to be free from ghosts",
    ", one needs to choose @xmath77 ) which corresponds to the critical gravity where a massive graviton becomes a massless graviton . because of a missing of ` @xmath74 ' sign",
    ", we may insist that eq.([se2-eq])[([lem2-eq ] ) ] by itself do not represent a correct linearized equation for studying the stability of the sads black hole in the einstein - weyl gravity .",
    "however , the overall ` @xmath74 ' sign in ( [ se2-eq])[([lem2-eq ] ) ] does not make any difference unless an external source is introduced in the right - hand side as eq.([source ] ) does indicate .",
    "therefore , the fourth - order gravity does not automatically imply the instability of the black hole even if one uses ( [ lem2-eq ] ) .",
    "hopefully , if one uses ( [ se1m - eq ] ) instead of ( [ lem2-eq ] ) , one is free from the ghost issue because ( [ se1m - eq ] ) is a genuine second - order equation .",
    "in einstein gravity , the linearized equation around the schwarzschild black hole is given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 ( [ ricc - t ] ) .",
    "then , the metric perturbation @xmath63 is classified depending on the transformation properties under parity , namely odd and even . using the regge - wheeler  @xcite and zerilli gauge  @xcite , one obtains two distinct perturbations : odd with 2 dof and even with 4 dof .",
    "this implies that one starts with 6 dof after choosing the regge - wheleer gauge , leading to 2 dof ( 1 for odd and 1 for even ) for a massless spin-2 graviton propagation .",
    "the schwarzschild black hole is stable against the metric perturbation  @xcite .",
    "performing the stability analysis of the sads black hole in einstein gravity , one has to use the linearized equation @xmath80 which was tuned out to be stable by following the regge - wheeler prescription  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the @xmath0-mode analysis is not necessary to show the stability of the schwarzschild and sads black holes because the massless spin-2 graviton requires modes with @xmath81 .    however , the @xmath14-mode analysis is responsible for detecting an instability of a massive graviton propagating on the sads black hole in einstein - weyl gravity .",
    "the even - parity metric perturbation is designed for a single @xmath14-mode analysis in the massive gravity and whose form is given by @xmath82 and @xmath83 as @xmath84 even though one starts with 4 dof , they are related to each other when one uses the ttg ( [ ttg ] ) .",
    "hence , we expect to have one decoupled equation for @xmath85 .    for a massive gravity theory in the minkowski background , there is correspondence between linearized ricci tensor @xmath86 and ricci spinor @xmath87 when using the newman - penrose formalism  @xcite . here",
    "the null real tetrad is necessary to specify polarization modes of a massive graviton , as the massive gravity requires null complex tetrad to specify six polarization modes  @xcite .",
    "this implies that in fourth - order gravity theory , one may take the linearized ricci tensor @xmath86 ( [ ricc - t ] ) with 6 dof as physical observables  @xcite . requiring @xmath88 further",
    ", the dof of @xmath86 is five which is the same dof for the metric perturbation @xmath63 in massive gravity theory .    at this stage ,",
    "we stress again that ( [ se1m - eq ] ) is considered as the second - order equation with respect to @xmath40 , but not the fourth - order equation ( [ four - eq ] ) for @xmath63 .",
    "hence , we propose @xmath40 as physical observables propagating on the sads black hole background instead of @xmath89 on the schwarzschild black hole background .",
    "also , we have the tracelessness of @xmath90 and the transversality of @xmath91 from the contracted bianchi identity",
    ". then , @xmath40 describe exactly five dof propagating on the sads black hole background without ghosts .    since eq.([lem2-eq ] ) is the same linearized equation for four - dimensional metric perturbation around five - dimensional black string , we follow the gl instability analysis in ads@xmath16 spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "eliminating all but @xmath85 , eq.([lem2-eq ] ) reduces to a second - order equation for @xmath85 @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 were given by ( 20 ) in  @xcite .",
    "we stress again that the @xmath14-mode perturbation is described by single dof but not 5 dof .",
    "the authors in  @xcite have solved ( [ second - eq ] ) numerically and found unstable modes for @xmath95 .",
    "1 that is generated from the numerical analysis . we note that @xmath96 correspond to @xmath97 , respectively . from the observation of fig . 1 with @xmath98 , we find unstable modes for @xmath99 with the mass @xmath100          similarly , we find eq.([lem2-eq ] ) when we replace @xmath101 by @xmath63 in ( [ se1m - eq ] ) .",
    "hence , a relevant equation for @xmath102 takes the same form @xmath103 which shows the same unstable modes appeared in fig .",
    "this implies that even if one uses ( [ lem2-eq ] ) as a linearized massive equation  @xcite , our conclusion remains unchanged because ( [ lem2-eq ] ) and ( [ se1m - eq ] ) are the same equation for different tensors .",
    "consequently , the instability arises from the massiveness ( @xmath104 ) but not from a feature of the fourth - order equation which gives the ` @xmath74 ' sign ( ghost = negative norm state ) when one splits it into two second - order equations .",
    "this implies that static black holes in massive gravity theory do not exist and/or they do not form in the gravitational collapse . if a black hole was formed in the massive gravity theory , one may ask what is the end - state of such instability . for unstable black strings of sads@xmath105r with translational symmetry ,",
    "there are some evidences that break - up occurs  @xcite . however , we consider a spherically symmetric black hole in four dimensions",
    ". a possible end - state may be a spherically symmetric black hole endowed with a graviton cloud  @xcite    finally , in the case of @xmath106 , the theory becomes massless and is stable against the einstein tensor perturbation .",
    "however , this corresponds precisely to the critical gravity when one uses the metric perturbation .",
    "here we have a non - unitarity issue due to the log - mode like ( [ crit - eq ] ) .",
    "also , one finds that @xmath107(adt mass)=0 and @xmath108(wald s entropy)=0 at the critical point , leading to a vacuum but not a black hole  @xcite .",
