    "the standard model ( sm ) of the elementary particles describes particle physics phenomena remarkably well up to the electroweak scale .",
    "in addition , the recent discovery of a higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite strengthens the success of the sm . on the other hand , the detailed measurements of the higgs boson properties have just started , and the whole structure of the higgs sector may have not been unveiled . therefore , theoretical and experimental studies of the extended higgs sector would be important to understand the nature of the higgs sector .",
    "one of simple extensions of the higgs sector in the sm is a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) where additional higgs doublet is introduced and both higgs doublets can couple to all fermions . as a result , flavor violating phenomena mediated by the higgs bosons are predicted  @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "such a flavor violation has been considered to be avoided because of lack of the experimental supports for the anomalous flavor - violating phenomena  @xcite .",
    "however , the cms collaboration has recently reported an event excess in a flavor - violating higgs decay @xmath0",
    "@xcite , and it suggests that the best fit value of the branching ratio is @xmath18 where the final state is a sum of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the deviation from the sm prediction is @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the result of the atlas experiment has also appeared recently  @xcite , and it is shown as @xmath22 which is consistent with the cms result within @xmath23 .",
    "although these results have not been conclusive yet , these become strong motivations to study the flavor violating phenomena predicted by the beyond standard models @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pointed out a possibility that the @xmath2 flavor violation in general 2hdm can explain not only the cms excess in the higgs decay @xmath0 , but also the anomaly of muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon g-2 )  @xcite .",
    "this possibility is interesting because two unexplained phenomena can be accommodated in the 2hdm , and hence it is worth further investigating this possibility . in this paper , we study phenomena related to @xmath3 and @xmath4 lepton physics in the scenario to see whether there are any interesting predictions and constraints caused by the @xmath2 flavor violation .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present a general 2hdm where both higgs doublets couple to all fermions .",
    "we discuss the yukawa interactions and higgs mass spectrum in the model . in section iii , we consider a solution where the cms excess in @xmath1 decay as well as muon g-2 anomaly can be explained by the @xmath2 flavor violating yukawa interactions in the model .",
    "we show the typical parameter space where both anomalies are explained . in section iv , we discuss @xmath4- and @xmath3-physics in the interesting region studied in the previous section .",

    ". the prediction of @xmath5 can be within the reach of the belle ii experiment , which will start near future .",
    "the extra higgs boson correction to @xmath6 can be as large as @xmath29 , but it is not large in @xmath7 mode .",
    "the future improvement of measurement on lepton flavor universality in @xmath30 decay will be important in the scenario .",
    "we also find that unlike the @xmath2 flavor violation suggested by the cms result , the @xmath15 and @xmath14 flavor violations are severely constrained since the constraint from the @xmath24 is strong .",
    "therefore , the processes related to @xmath15 and @xmath14 flavor violations are suppressed . in section",
    "v , we also discuss an implication to higgs physics .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath14 flavor violating yukawa couplings are strongly suppressed , @xmath17 and @xmath31 higgs decay modes will not be observed in this scenario , contrary to @xmath0 mode . in section",
    "vi , we summarize our results .",
    "in a general two higgs doublet model , there are no symmetry to distinguish the two different higgs doublets .",
    "thus , both the higgs doublets can couple to all fermions , and hence there are flavor violating interactions in higgs sector . in general , when the higgs potential is minimized in the sm - like vacuum , both neutral components of higgs doublets develop nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . taking a certain linear combination , we can define the basis where only one of the higgs doublets obtains the nonzero vev as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are nambu - goldstone bosons , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are a charged higgs boson and a cp - odd higgs boson , respectively",

    "we have assumed that the tiny neutrino masses are achieved by the seesaw mechanism introducing super - heavy right - handed neutrinos , so that in the low - energy effective theory , the left - handed neutrinos have a @xmath55 majorana mass matrix . the yukawa coupling constants @xmath56 are general @xmath57 complex matrices and can be sources of the higgs - mediated flavor changing processes .    in mass eigenstates of higgs bosons ,",

    "the both anomalies can not be explained by the sm , and hence they might be an indication of physics beyond the sm . in this section , we discuss whether the general 2hdm can accommodate both anomalies simultaneously , and investigate the parameter space where both anomalies can be explained .",

    ", the atlas collaboration has also shown the result , @xmath77  @xcite , which is consistent with the cms one .",
    "it would be an indication of new physics because the sm can not accommodate the excess .",

    "we have shown that the @xmath2 flavor violating yukawa couplings in the general 2hdm explain the cms excess in the @xmath0 decay mode . here",

    "<S> motivated by the recent cms excess in a flavor violating higgs decay @xmath0 as well as the anomaly of muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon g-2 ) , we consider a scenario where both the excess in @xmath1 and the anomaly of muon g-2 are explained by the @xmath2 flavor violation in a general two higgs doublet model . </S>",
    "<S> we study various processes involving @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and then discuss the typical predictions and constraints in this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we find that the prediction of @xmath5 can be within the reach of the belle ii experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the lepton non - universality between @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be sizable , and hence the analysis of the current belle data and the future experimental improvement would have an impact on this model . </S>",
    "<S> besides , processes such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and muon edm can be accessible , depending on the unknown yukawa couplings . on the other hand , the processes like @xmath12 and @xmath13 could not be sizable to observe because of the current strong constraints on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 flavor violations . then we also conclude that contrary to @xmath1 decay mode , the lepton flavor violating higgs boson decay modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are strongly suppressed , and hence it will be difficult to observe these modes at the lhc experiment . </S>"
