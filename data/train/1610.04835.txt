    "the structure , strength and stability of ligand - receptor bonds have been investigated extensively over several decades @xcite .",
    "the concepts ( and definitions ) of ligand and receptor have also evolved during this period . in the words of martin karplus @xcite , `` the ligand can be as small as an electron , an atom or diatomic molecule and as large as a protein '' . in principle , the definition of a ligand can be extended even further to a stiff filament formed by a hierarchical organization of proteins ; the microtubule ( mt ) @xcite , a nano - tube in eukaryotic cells , is an example of such filaments .",
    "thus , if such a stiff straight filament is tethered to a flat rigid wall by wall - anchored proteins that bind specifically to the filament , the attachment can be viewed as a ` ligand - receptor bond ' where the filament is the analog of a ligand .",
    "inspired by this generalized definition of ligands and receptors , we study here a very special type of _ non - covalent _ filament - wall attachment from the perspective of ligand - receptor bonds .",
    "the tether protein that we consider here are ` active ' in the sense that these consume chemical fuel for their mechanical function .",
    "the theoretical model developed in this paper is motivated by the typical attachment formed by a mt with the cortex of a living eukaryotic cell where the two are linked by dynein molecules @xcite ; dynein is a motor protein powered by input chemical energy extracted from atp hydrolysis @xcite .",
    "there are equispaced dynein - binding sites on the surface of a mt where the head of a dynein can bind specifically ; the tail of the dyneins are anchored on the cortex .",
    "thus , dyneins function as tethers linking the mt with the wall ; unbinding of _ all _ the dynein heads from the mt would rupture the mt - cortex attachment .",
    "however , the model developed in this paper captures only some of the key features of the real mt - cortex attachments like , for example , the polymerization - depolymerization of mt @xcite .",
    "the wall in our model mimics the cell cortex .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the mt - wall model developed here differs fundamentally from another mt - wall model reported earlier in ref.@xcite ( from now onwards referred to as the ssc model ) .",
    "unlike the active ( i , e . , energy consuming ) linkers , which here mimic dynein motors , the dominant tethers in the ssc model are passive . moreover , the wall in the ssc model represents a kinetochore @xcite , a proteinous complex on the surface of a chromosome , whereas the wall in the model developed in this paper represents the cell cortex .",
    "although the formation of the mt - wall attachment itself is an interesting phenomenon , we do not study it here . instead ,",
    "in this paper we consider a pre - formed attachment to investigate its strength and stability using a kinetic model that mimics the protocols of dynamic force spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "two distinct protocols are routinely used in force spectroscopy for measuring the strength and stability of ligand - receptor bonds @xcite . in the _ force - clamp _ protocol",
    ", a time - independent load tension is applied against the bond ; the time duration after which the bond is just broken is the life time of the bond . since the underlying physical process is dominated by thermal fluctuations different values of life time",
    "are observed upon repetition of the experiment .",
    "therefore , the _ stability _ of the bond is characterized by the life time distribution ( ltd ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the _ force - ramp _ protocol the magnitude of the time - dependent load tension is ramped up at a pre - decided rate till the bond just gets ruptured ; the rupture force distribution ( rfd ) characterizes the _ strength _ of the bond . for a _ slip - bond _ the mean life time ( mlt ) decreases monotonically with the increasing magnitude of the tension in the force - clamp experiment . in contrast , a nonmotonic variation ( an initial increase followed by decrease ) of the mlt with increasing load tension in the force - clamp experiments is a characteristic feature of _ catch - bonds _ @xcite . although the force - ramp is a more natural protocol for dynamic force spectroscopy @xcite the results provide somewhat indirect evidence for catch - bonds .",
    "we mimic both the force - clamp and force - ramp protocols in our computer simulations of the theoretical model to compute the ltd and rfd for the motor - linked mt - wall attachment . the results",
    "establish that this attachment is , effectively , like a slip - bond .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to results obtained from the ssc model ; the latter exhibits a catch - bond - like behavior as observed also in experiments performed _ in - vitro_. to our knowledge , similar dynamic force spectroscopic experiments have not been attempted so far on mt - cell cortex attachments . nevertheless , our generic theoretical model and the results are likely to motivate such experiments in near future .",
    "the model is quite general . in principle , the same model can serve , after appropriate minor adaptation , as a minimal model for many other attachments formed by a polymerizing - depolymerizing filament with a wall where the specific interaction of the two arises from a set of active linkers .",
    "we model the mt as a strictly one - dimensional stiff filament . the plus end of the mt is oriented along the + x - direction of the one - dimensional coordinate system chosen for the model .",
    "the rigid wall facing the mt filament is perpendicular to the x - axis .",
    "as stated earlier , our model is motivated by the cortex - mt attachment where dynein motors tether the mt to the cortex . since a dynein motor , fuelled by atp ,",
    "has a natural tendency to walk towards the minus end of the mt , the molecular motors in our model are also assumed to be minus - end directed , while consuming input energy , in the absence of external load tension .",
    "we assume that each motor is permanently anchored onto the rigid wall and can not detach from it while the head of a motor can attach to the mt and a motor already attached to the mt can also detach from it .",
    "we model the linkage between a motor and the rigid wall by an elastic element that is approximated as a hookean spring .",
    "the wall is assumed to execute one - dimensional diffusion along the x - coordinate with a diffusion constant @xmath0 .",
    "and @xmath1 represents the distance of mt tip and dynein motor from cell cortex . in the inset",
    "mt interact with cell cortex through the cortical dynein motor and dynein motor is attached with cell cortex using different protein .",
    "dynein are attached with cell cortex through a spring with spring constant @xmath2 .",
    "external force @xmath3 is applied on axoneme ( orange ) from which mts ( green ) are generated.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    although each dynein motor has two heads , each capable of binding specific sites on the mt , we denote the position of a motor by the location of its midpoint .",
    "the two heads are , effectively , connected at the midpoint by a hinge ; the midpoint is also linked to the point of anchoring on the wall by an elastic element that is assumed to be a hookean spring . in the one - dimensional coordinate system the origin is fixed on the wall . with respect to this origin",
    "@xmath4 denotes the position of the _ midpoint _ of an arbitrary molecular motor at time @xmath5 while @xmath6 denotes the corresponding position the mt tip . in this model ,",
    "@xmath7 can change because of the following processes : + ( i ) stepping of a motor while the wall remains frozen in its current position , and + ( ii ) diffusion of the wall while motor does not step out of its current binding site on the mt .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is the maximum distance upto which a motor can bind to the mt .",
    "so the motor can bind only if its head is located between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) .",

    ", @xmath15 denotes the rate of binding of its head to the mt .",
    "therefore , at any arbitrary instant of time @xmath5 , the rate of a binding event , i.e. , the rate at which any of the unbound motor binds to the mt is @xcite @xmath16    because of being anchored on the fixed rigid wall , the motors bound to the mt can not walk freely along the mt track . moreover , because of the upper cutoff imposed on the maximum possible elongation of the spring , a motor can move only upto a maximum distance @xmath10 .",
    "if the rest position of motor head is @xmath17 , the spring force acting on the motor is given by @xmath18 here we assume external load @xmath3 to be equally shared by @xmath19 motors so that each motor feels the load @xmath20 thus , the effective force felt by single motor head that is bound to mt and located at a position @xmath7 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is given by ( [ eq - spring ] ) .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the rate of unbinding of the head of a motor in the absence of load force .",
    "when a load force @xmath3 tends to rupture the attachment , the unbinding rate increases .",
    "following kramers ( or bell ) theory we assume an approximate exponential dependence @xcite @xmath24 the characteristic ` detachment force ' @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the extension of the energy barrier between the bound and unbound state of a motor",
    ". the effective rate of unbinding of a single motor head from the mt is given by @xcite @xmath28    suppose the rate of forward hopping of a motor towards the minus end of of the mt is @xmath29 .",
    "but the forward stepping of motor will be opposed by the spring force @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the effective rate of forward stepping of a motor is given by @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a constant parameter ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the characteristic force @xmath33 can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the length of a single subunit of mt .",
    "based on the well known experimentally observed facts , we assume that a motor can also step towards the positive end of mt under sufficiently high load force @xcite ; the rate of stepping in that ` reverse ' direction is given by @xmath36 where the rate @xmath37 of stepping of a motor towards the plus end of the mt in the absence of load force is very small @xmath38 because the natural direction of these motors is the minus end of mt .",
    "the form ( [ k_r ] ) captures the intuitive expectation that @xmath39 would increase with increasing spring force .    the probability that ( the midpoint of ) a motor is located at @xmath40 and mt tip is at @xmath41 , while the total number @xmath13 of motors are bound to the mt simultaneously at that instant of time , is given by @xmath42 .",
