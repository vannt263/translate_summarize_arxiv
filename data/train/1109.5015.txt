    "the existence of nontrivial topological configurations in qcd vacuum is a fundamental property of the gauge theory though until now there is no direct experimental evidence for topological effects .",
    "transitions between different topological states occur with the change of the topological number @xmath0 characterizing these states and induce anomalous processes like local violation of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the interplay of these topological configurations with ( chiral ) quarks results in the local imbalance of chirality .",
    "such chiral asymmetry coupled to a strong magnetic field , created by colliding nuclei perpendicularly to the reaction plane , induces a current of electric charge along the direction of a magnetic field which leads to a separation of oppositely charged particles with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "thus , as was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite the topological effects in qcd may be observed in heavy ion collisions directly in the presence of very intense external magnetic fields due to the `` chiral magnetic effect '' ( cme ) as a manifestation of spontaneous violation of the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "it was shown that the electromagnetic field of the required strength can be created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "first experimental evidence for the cme identified via the observed charge separation effect with respect to the reaction plane was presented by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite .",
    "recently preliminary data below the nominal rhic energy ( beam energy scan program )  @xcite and at the lhc energy  @xcite have been obtained .    in this paper",
    "we shortly remain our analysis of the first star data  @xcite and compare results with new finding . in respect to the cme",
    ", we also make a dynamical estimate of the cme background based on the nonequalibrium hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) microscopical transport approach @xcite supplemented by the treatment of electromagnetic field evolution .",
    "we remind here our phenomenological model used in the cme analysis in ref .  @xcite .    for one - dimensional random walk in the topological number space the topological charge ( winding number ) @xmath0 generated during the time @xmath3 ,",
    "when the magnetic field is present , may be estimated as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sphaleron transition rate which in weak and strong coupling @xmath6 with different coefficients .",
    "the initial temperature @xmath7 of the produced matter at time @xmath8 is proportional to the saturation momentum @xmath9 , @xmath10 . in the last semiequality of ( [ def1 ] )",
    "the expansion time and the corresponding time dependence of the temperature are neglected . since sizable sphaleron transitions occur only in the deconfined phase , the time @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ def1 ] ) is really the smallest lifetime between the strong magnetic field @xmath11 one and the lifetime of deconfined matter @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "the measured electric charge particle asymmetry is associated with the averaged correlator @xmath14 by the following relation  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane defined by the beam axis and the line joining the centers of colliding nuclei .",
    "averaging in ( [ cos ] ) is carried out over the whole event ensemble .",
    "the second equality in ( [ cos ] ) corresponds to azimuthal measurements with respect to particle of type @xmath17 extracted from three - body correlation analysis  @xcite , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the directed and elliptic flow parameters , respectively . according to ref .",
    "@xcite an average correlator @xmath20 is related to the topological charge , @xmath0 , as @xmath21 where absorption and rescattering in dense matter are neglected for the same and opposite charge correlations . in the last equality we assumed that @xmath22  @xcite .    as follows from eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) , the @xmath23 violation effect can be quantified by the correlator @xmath24 the normalization constant @xmath25 can be tuned at the reference energy @xmath26200 gev from the inverse relation ( [ rel ] ) and experimental value @xmath27 at this energy for @xmath2810 fm @xmath29 the only quantity needed is the lifetime @xmath3 defined as the time during which the magnetic field is above the critical value @xmath30 needed to support a fermion landau level on the domain wall @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the domain wall area . since the size of the domain wall is not reliably known , it is hard to pin down the number , but it should be of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we have to treat @xmath30 as a free parameter which defines the lifetime from the calculated @xmath34 distribution  @xcite . as to the impact parameter distribution ,",
    "the cme is assumed to be roughly linear in @xmath35 ref .",
    "taking this as a hypothesis we evaluate the centrality dependence of the cme fitting this line to points @xmath36 fm ( or centrality @xmath37 ) to be estimated in our model and @xmath38 where the cme is zero .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ cme_cu ] for au+au collisions .",
    "as is seen , the calculated lines quite reasonably reproduce the measured points of azimuthal asymmetry of same - charge particles for au@xmath39au collisions at @xmath26200 and 62 gev .",
    "the chosen critical field value @xmath40 results in absence of the cme above the top sps energy because the critical magnetic field practically coincides with the maximal field at this bombarding energy .",
    "this finding is in a qualitative agreement with very recent preliminary star results that the difference between same - charge and opposite charge correlations is decreasing with decreasing beam energy what takes place at @xmath4140 gev  @xcite .    in the model",
    "considered , the cme at the energy 5.5 tev is expected to be less by a factor of about 20 as compared to those at the rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "note that at the lhc energy we applied a simplified semi - analytical model  @xcite for magnetic field creation .",
    "thus , our lhc estimate should be considered as an upper limit for the cme .",
    "recent preliminary lhc pbpb data  @xcite show a remarkable agreement in both the magnitude and the behavior with the results reported by star in au - au collisions at @xmath42200 gev .",
    "preliminary kinetic calculations at the lhc energy 2.76 tev increase the maximal magnetic field by a factor about three but it does not influence essentially on the relaxation time .",
    "the discussed cme signal , the electric charge asymmetry with respect to the reaction plane , can originate not only from the spontaneous local cp violation but also be simulated by other possible effects . in this respect",
    "it is important to consider the cme background .",
    "we shall do that considering a full evolution of nucleus - nucleus collisions in terms of the hsd transport model @xcite but including formation of electromagnetic field as well as its evolution and impact on particle propagation .",

    "the nuclear region outside this almond corresponds to spectator matter which is the dominant source of the electromagnetic field at the very beginning of the nuclear collision . note that in the hsd code the particles are subdivided into target and projectile spectators and participants not geometrically but dynamically : spectators are nucleons which suffered yet no collision .",
