    "heavy ion collisions at varying beam energies are performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) with the goal to probe properties of strong - interaction matter at different temperatures and baryon chemical potentials .",

    "the hope is to find evidence for the existence of a critical point @xcite in the phase diagram of strong - interaction matter that marks the end of a line of first order phase transitions .    with decreasing beam energy , @xmath1 , more baryons from the incident nuclei",
    "are stopped leading to an increase in the baryon number density and thus also to an increase of the baryon chemical potential in a central rapidity window .",
    "the dense matter created in these collisions is expected to reach local thermal equilibrium quickly .",

    "eventually hadrons start to form again .",
    "this hadronization is characterized by a temperature ( @xmath2 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath3 ) that varies with @xmath1 .",
    "shortly thereafter inelastic interactions among the hadrons cease to occur and different particle species  freeze - out  .",
    "this so - called chemical freeze - out is characterized by a set of freeze - out parameters , @xmath4 . with varying @xmath1",
    "they map out a line in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane , called the freeze - out line , @xmath5 .",
    "an important question is how close the freeze - out line is to the pseudo - critical line , @xmath6 @xcite , characterizing the crossover transition of qcd .",
    "the proximity of both lines in the phase diagram is a pre - requisite for being able to explore critical behavior in the vicinity of a possibly existing critical point , by analyzing observables that can probe physics on the freeze - out line .    unlike the crossover line , @xmath6 , for which the transition temperature at @xmath7 @xcite and the leading order correction at small @xmath8 @xcite have been determined in lattice qcd calculations , the parametrization of the freeze - out line , @xmath5 , is not given in terms of fundamental parameters of qcd .",
    "the line characterizes the expanding medium formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "freeze - out parameters have been determined in a wide range of @xmath1 by comparing experimental data on particle yields with statistical hadronization models ( hrg models ) .",
    "parametrizations of the freeze - out line @xmath5 have been extracted from such analyses @xcite .",
    "physically motivated anstze , such as identifying @xmath5 with a line of constant energy per particle @xcite , naturally lead to the expectation that @xmath5 is a function of @xmath8 that decreases with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , a simple ansatz @xcite , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , provides a good parametrization in the entire energy range probed in heavy ion collisions . using this ansatz for the comparison of hrg model calculations with experimental data obtained for a wide range of energies @xmath1 gave @xmath11 @xcite for the curvature coefficient .",
    "however , a recently performed refined hadronization model analysis suggests a weaker energy dependence of the freeze - out line @xcite .",
    "moreover , the attempt to capture more accurately the behavior of freeze - out temperatures at large @xmath1 , i.e. small @xmath3 , lead to a phenomenological parametrization @xcite that does not even have a power - like dependence on @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath12 which favors @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    "we improve over the current situation by outlining a procedure to determine the @xmath14 coefficient of the freeze - out line from measurements of the mean and variance of net - electric charge and net - proton number distributions and , for the first time , illustrate how this can be done by comparing experimental data obtained at large @xmath1 directly with a qcd calculation .",
    "this puts the determination of the curvatures of the freeze - out line on a par with that of the qcd transition line .",
    "the mean , @xmath15 , and variance , @xmath16 , of net - electric charge ( @xmath17 ) and net - baryon number ( @xmath18 ) distributions are obtained as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath19 by taking derivatives of the qcd pressure with respect to @xmath20 @xmath21 the ratios of mean and variance , @xmath22 can be analyzed in heavy ion experiments . implementing the constraints @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are appropriate for the initial conditions met in such collisions , the ratios @xmath25 and @xmath26 become functions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 only and @xmath27 . in leading order ( lo )",

    "this explains about 40% of the difference in @xmath26 seen by star and phenix .",
    "it is conceivable that the remainder arises from the small azimuthal coverage in the phenix experiment which further reduces the acceptance of charged particles @xcite . in order to get better controll over these effects a more detailed experimental study of systematics of arising from non - zero @xmath59 cuts and cuts in the rapidity coverage",

    "it is consistent with the curvature of the qcd crossover line . at least for beam energies",

    "we have addressed some difficulties that arise when comparing lattice qcd calculations of conserved charge fluctuations with experimental data on cumulants of net - proton and net - charge fluctuations , although at present it is difficulty to provide a complete quantitative approach for this .",
    "we have pointed out some obvious differences between net - proton and net - baryon number fluctuations that are present already in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we also addressed the question on the influence of transverse momentum cuts on the experimental data .",
    "clearly control over these effects needs to be improved in future work .",
    "it also is known that cumulants of conserved charge fluctuations are sensitive to the width of the rapidity window covered by the experiments @xcite .",
    "this dependence is more significant for net - electric charge fluctuations than for net - proton number fluctuations .",
    "increasing the rapidity window will decrease @xmath95 and thus will lead to an increase of @xmath96 .",
    "this will lead to larger values for @xmath43 .",
    "however , at present these effects are difficult to quantify .",
    "finally we note that throughout our analysis we assumed that the net - charge to net - baryon number ratio , @xmath97 , is determined by the corresponding ratio present in the incident beams , @xmath50 .",
    "this ratio clearly will fluctuate in a fixed acceptance range covered in an experiment and one may argue that this ratio also shifts towards the isospin symmetric limit @xmath98 for high beam energies . clearly , at present beam energies @xmath99 , as the net - charge expectation value would vanish in the isospin symmetric limit . in a more refined analysis",
    "one may , however , take into account effects arising from changes in the value of @xmath97 which may also be beam energy dependent .",
    "in general , increasing @xmath97 results in a decrease of @xmath43 and an increase of @xmath54 . compared to other uncertainties , however , this effect is small . for the preliminary star data set ( star2.0 )",
    "we find , for instance , that using @xmath100 decreases the @xmath43 by 3  mev and shifts the curvature coefficient to a slightly positive value , @xmath101 .",
