    "globular clusters were proposed as good hunting grounds for rapidly rotating pulsars because they were known to contain a relatively high proportion of potential progenitor systems such as low mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "since the first globular cluster pulsar was found in m28 @xcite , several dozen have been found in a number of clusters @xcite .",
    "this paved the way for new understanding of the formation and evolution of millisecond pulsars @xcite , as well as providing opportunities for other applications such as measuring cluster gravitational potentials @xcite .    in an early search of the cluster terzan 5 @xcite ,",
    "two radio pulsars were found , psr  b1744@xmath024a and psr  b1744@xmath024b .",
    "psr  b1744@xmath024a ( also known as psr  j1748@xmath02446a ) is clearly associated with the cluster and lies @xmath1 from its core .",
    "the pulsar is in a 1.7-hour orbit and is often eclipsed by its companion star @xcite .",
    "psr  b1744@xmath024b is rather weak and , until now , it has not had a phase connected timing solution , so that its precise position was not known and any association with the cluster was unclear .",
    "radio continuum observations at the vla have revealed the presence of a number of steep spectrum radio sources , within , or close to , the core of the cluster , hinting at the possibility of as yet undiscovered pulsars @xcite . since psr  j1748@xmath02446a is not in the core of the cluster and we show here that psr  b1744@xmath024b is not associated with the cluster at all ,",
    "these two pulsars account for none of the flux density detected by fruchter & goss ( 1990 ) .",
    "this suggests that there may be further undiscovered pulsars within the core of the cluster .",
    "any other pulsars may remain undetected as a result of broadening of the pulses due to dispersion in the receiver filterbank channels , broadening of the pulses due to acceleration in tight orbits , very short pulsation period or insufficient sensitivity . in this paper",
    ", we report on a search which was undertaken to try to resolve these issues and present the one new pulsar that was found , which we have designated psr  j1748@xmath02446c .",
    "we also report on timing observations of both this pulsar and psr  b1744@xmath024b in order to establish their positions and associations with the cluster .",
    "the globular cluster terzan 5 was observed on 1994 april 15 for 1.6 hours and on 1994 sept . 14 for 2.8 hours with the parkes telescope using a 64-mhz band",
    "centred on 1392  mhz .",
    "dual channel cryogenic receivers were used in conjunction with a 2x256x0.25  mhz channel filter bank .",
    "after detection , the signals from the two linearly polarised channels were added , one - bit digitised at a sampling interval of 0.3ms and written to magnetic tape .",
    "the beam width was @xmath2 arc and the dispersion smearing per channel at the cluster dispersion measure of @xmath3240 @xmath4pc was 0.2  ms , a factor of four better than the earlier search @xcite . for long - period pulsars ,",
    "the sensitivity of this search is approximately 40 per cent better than the previous search .",
    "the data were first processed using standard techniques for unaccelerated pulsars @xcite .",
    "psr  j1748@xmath02446c was found as an isolated pulsar with a period of approximately 8  ms . to provide some sensitivity to accelerated pulsars ,",
    "the two observations were each split into 20 segments .",
    "a fourier transform was then applied to each segment and the resulting power spectra were stacked to give a time versus frequency plot in which accelerated pulsars would show up as sloping tracks .",
    "since we were only searching one location and a small range of dispersion measures ( 185260 @xmath4pc ) it was possible to inspect the stacked spectra by eye . despite having sensitivity to millisecond pulsars in orbits as short as 20 minutes , no further new pulsars were found this way .",

    "pulse arrival times for the three pulsars in or near terzan 5 were obtained on a regular basis since their discovery using the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank with cryogenic receivers at 606 and 1404mhz . both hands of circular polarisation were observed using a @xmath14-mhz filter bank at 606mhz and a @xmath15-mhz filter bank at 1404mhz . after detection , the signals from the two polarisations were added , filtered , digitised at appropriate sampling intervals and dedispersed in hardware before being folded on - line , and written to disk .",
    "observations were typically of 18 minutes duration .    for each pulsar , a standard pulse template was fitted to the observed profiles at each frequency to determine the pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) .",
    "the toas , weighted by their individual uncertainties determined in the fitting process , were analysed with the tempo software package ( http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) , using the de200 ephemeris of the jet propulsion laboratory @xcite and the blandford & teukolsky ( 1976 ) timing model for binary pulsars .",
    "the resulting model parameters are summarised in table 1 .",
    "the new single millisecond pulsar , psr  j1748@xmath02446c ( ter5c ) , lies only about @xmath16 from the cluster centre ( @xmath17(j2000 ) : @xmath18 , @xmath19(j2000 ) : @xmath20 @xcite ) and has a dispersion measure close to that of psr  j1748@xmath02446a ( ter5a ) , suggesting with high probability that it also is associated with the cluster .",
    "the position for psr  j1748@xmath02444 given in table 1 is @xmath21 from the cluster centre , indicating that it is unlikely that this pulsar is associated with the cluster .",
    "as table 1 shows , this pulsar has a dispersion measure which differs from the values for the other two pulsars , ter5a and ter5c , by about 30 @xmath4 pc , adding weight to the conclusion that psr  j1748@xmath02444 is not associated with the cluster .",
    "the period of 0.443  s and the measured period derivative indicates that it is an unremarkable pulsar , having a surface magnetic field of @xmath22 g which is near to the lower end of the distribution of normal pulsars @xcite , and a characteristic age of 63  my .",
    "figure 1 shows the positions of the two cluster pulsars and other sources around terzan 5 relative to the cluster centre .",
    "the two radio sources ( n and s ) were found by fruchter & goss ( 2000 ) in a continuum image of the region at around 1400  mhz . although the position of source n agrees within the errors with that of the 8.4-ms pulsar psr  j1748@xmath02446c , the flux density of the pulsed emission from this pulsar has a mean value of only @xmath23  mjy .",
    "this is significantly less than the flux density of source n , 1.5 mjy .",
    "neither the flux density of the pulsar or of source n vary significantly between observations , so that such variations can not explain the discrepancy .",
    "we conclude therefore that other , rapidly - rotating pulsars or pulsars in short - period binary orbits may exist in terzan 5 .",
    "searches with a more sensitive receiving system having better time and frequency resolution may find them .",
    "johnston , verbunt & hasinger ( 1995 ) identified a transient x - ray source close to the cluster core ; its positional accuracy is not sufficient to confirm an identification with the radio source s.    the negative period derivatives of ter5a and ter5c indicate that they lie behind the cluster and are experiencing a gravitational acceleration towards the cluster core in the manner described by phinney ( 1992 ) .",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic period derivatives are greater than zero and follow the procedures of phinney ( 1992 ) and camilo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we can place a lower limit on the central mass density @xmath24 of the cluster . using the cluster core radius @xmath25 @xcite , a cluster distance of 7.6 kpc @xcite , and the cluster position of fruchter & goss ( 2000 ) , we find lower limits on @xmath24 of @xmath26 and @xmath27 m@xmath28pc@xmath29 for ter5a and ter5c , respectively .",
    "we note that the latter is considerably lower than the value of the density quoted by webbink ( 1985 ) of @xmath30 m@xmath28pc@xmath29 ."
