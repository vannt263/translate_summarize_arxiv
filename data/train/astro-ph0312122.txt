    "in addition , the calcium hk index varied smoothly on the same timescale .",
    "this indicated the @xmath1 variations were most likely due to stellar activity rather than a planetary companion .",
    "@xcite showed starspots to be the cause of the line shifts in hd 192263 and gwh and p. butler see the same thing in hd 19632 ( private communication , 2002 ) . additionally , @xcite and @xcite confirm the models presented by @xcite .",

    "the motivations for the keck hyades survey are discussed by @xcite . with a sample of 98 stars , with [ fe / h]=0.13 @xcite , we might expect a small number of short - period planets similar to 51 peg @xcite . from our keck",
    "hyades sample , we chose four stars for follow - up observations with the het s high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) in search of short - period planetary companions .",
    "the targets were chosen from a group of stars which showed significant @xmath1 rms on short timescales . only four were observed at this time due to het scheduling constraints .",
    "the image quality of the telescope was being corrected during this time , and though this did not affect the quality of the observations , it placed a magnitude limit on the stars which could be observed .",
    "the observed targets are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath1 observations from the keck high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) are described in full in @xcite .",
    "we began regular observations of these four stars from late - december 2001 to mid - february 2002 ( and a few observations of each star taken sporadically during the fall of 2001 ) with the hrs at the het @xcite .",
    "we used the 3 \" optical fiber feed to the hrs with resolving power r=60,000 .",
    "we set the 316 g / mm cross disperser to central wavelength 5938 .",
    "this includes almost the entire i@xmath4 region ( @xmath5 ; i@xmath4 is used as the velocity metric ) , on one of the ccd chips .",
    "any other configuration would result in spreading the i@xmath4 region over both ccd chips and losing some i@xmath4 information in the gap between ccds .",
    "we manufactured the i@xmath4 gas absorption cell for use in the hrs at the university of texas , and during these observations , it was run at 60@xmath6c .",
    "each exposure was restricted to 15 minutes in length to reduce velocity smearing due to the earth s rotation .",
    "this limited the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , but was necessary to obtain high @xmath1 precision ( see paulson et al .",
    "the s / n varied greatly from exposure to exposure due to seeing variations , but all observations had s / n @xmath7200 per pixel .",
    "the ccd images were reduced and extracted using standard iraf packages .",
    "we use a program called radial ( developed at the university of texas ( ut ) and mcdonald observatory ) to measure precise radial velocities .",
    "this program was adapted for use with data from all of the planet search programs affiliated with ut .",
    "brief discussions of the program may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the @xmath8 amplitudes are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath8 amplitude for hd  26756 , which is not found to have significant periodicity , is just defined as one half of the peak - to - peak variation of the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 data are listed in table 2 .",
    "between 11 and 14 nightly photometric observations of each of the four stars were acquired in 2002 february and march with the t12 0.8  m automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory in the patagonia mountains of southern arizona .",
    "the t12 apt measures the difference in brightness between a program star and nearby comparison stars in the strmgren @xmath9 and @xmath2 passbands .",
    "the observing procedures and data reduction techniques employed with this apt are identical to those for the t8 0.8  m apt described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting strmgren @xmath9 and @xmath2 differential magnitudes were corrected for differential extinction with nightly extinction coefficients and transformed to the strmgren system with yearly mean transformation coefficients .",
    "the external precision of the differential magnitudes , defined as the standard deviation of a single differential magnitude from the seasonal mean of the differential magnitudes , is typically around 0.0012 mag for this telescope , as determined from observations of pairs of constant stars .",
    "our primary comparison stars for were hd  26737 ( for hd  26736 ) , hd  27561 ( for hd  26756 and hd  26767 ) , and hd  18579 ( for hip  13806 ) ; all three comparison stars are constant to @xmath00.003 mag or better as determined by intercomparison with additional comparison stars .",
    "the resulting range in the differential @xmath2 magnitudes ( @xmath10 ) of our four program stars are given in table  1 .",
    "photometric data are listed in table 3 .",
    "we are able to determine the rotational period ( @xmath11 ) for these stars from both sets of observations- @xmath1 and @xmath10 , independently .",
    "we used the method of @xcite for period determination , and all results are listed in table 1 .",
    "we independently determined periods from the photometric data using the procedure outlined in @xcite , and these periods are as follows : hip  13806- 9.57@xmath120.18 d , hd  26736- 8.48@xmath120.35 d , hd  26767- 8.69@xmath120.13 d. these agree with the periods determined by the method of horne & baliunas ( listed in table 1 ) .",
    "hd  26736 , hd  26767 and hip  13806 all show relatively significant periods in the period analysis , with false alarm probabilities ( faps ) of @xmath13 ( also calculated by the method described in horne & baliunas ) .",
    "@xmath11 is also consistent between spectroscopic and photometric data assuring us that the periods derived in @xmath1 are due to rotational modulation of stellar activity .",
    "we chose to use @xmath11 determined from @xmath1 to show the phase plots in figure 1 since there were more data available .",
    "we could , equally as well , have chosen to phase the plots according to @xmath11 as derived from the photometry .",
    "zero phase was chosen to be at photometric maximum , which roughly corresponds to the time at which the @xmath1 curve crosses from `` blue '' to `` red '' .",
    "this is done so because photometric maximum is an easily understandable physical event , thus `` grounding '' the phase plot .",
    "the associated @xmath1 plots are only the results of the active regions ( photometric variations ) .",
    "we searched the hipparcos epoch photometry ( esa ) of each of these stars for periodicity .",
    "the period finding algorithm of horne & baliunas was again used to search for periodicity in the hipparcos data set .",
    "when @xcite studied hd  166435 , they noticed that by taking small sections of their data in time , they were able to recover @xmath11 .",
    "however , when taking the entire data se set , they saw no obvious signature of @xmath11 .",
    "this was an effect of phase shifts as the spots migrated either in longitude with stellar differential rotation or in latitude @xmath14 appeared or disappeared asymmetrically .",
    "hd  26736 and hd  26767 appear to behave like hd  166435 in that the full photometric data set from hipparcos shows no obvious periodicity .",
    "this is also true for the @xmath1 data sets of these stars observed from keck , although weak signals may be present for these two stars .",
    "however , the @xmath11 is recovered when taking small intervals of keck @xmath1 data in time for these two program stars .",
    "the case of hip  13806 is different ; we found a strong period at 9.60 days ( fap of 0.02% ) in the full hipparcos data set .",
    "the periodogram peak is sufficiently wide that it encompasses @xmath11 derived from both @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is somewhat poorly defined from the hipparcos observations alone .",
    "the phase curve for the hip  13806 hipparcos data with a 9.42 day period is shown in figure 2 .",
    "hip  13806 is unusual in that the same period seems to be more or less coherent , though quite noisy , over the @xmath02.5 year time frame of the hipparcos observations .",
    "hip  13806 is also notable in that it is one of few dwarf stars which show this long term stability of active regions . @xcite",
    "also observed the g8 dwarf star @xmath15  boo  a show a coherent period over the course of four observing seasons .",
    "certainly , this activity is unusually stable .",
    "we determined the projected stellar rotational velocity ( @xmath16 ) for each of these stars using the radial velocity `` template '' spectra ( observed without the i@xmath4 cell in place ) obtained during the keck observing runs . using the newest version of the lte line analysis code moog @xcite , we first derived stellar parameters- effective temperature ( @xmath18 ) , surface gravity ( log @xmath19 ) , microturbulence ( @xmath15 ) and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) for these four stars with interpolated atmosphere models based on the 1995 version of atlas9 code @xcite .",
    "we used no convective overshoot in the model atmospheres .",
    "we measured equivalent widths of about 20 unblended fe i lines and 10 unblended fe ii lines for each star in the region 4490 to 6175(linelist provided in paulson et al .",
    "2003 . in a self - consistent manner ,",
    "@xmath20 values for each line were derived from the kurucz solar atlas @xcite and confirmed with a solar spectrum taken through hires .",
    "the stellar parameters derived are listed in table 4 .",
    "the average [ fe / h ] values listed are relative to solar ( log @xmath21(fe / h)@xmath22 = 7.52 , @xcite ) . using these parameters",
    ", we then synthesized a spectral region with 5 fe i lines in the region 6150 - 6180 . in order to determine @xmath16 , we compute a disk intensity profile and then convolve that with a broadening function .",
    "this broadening function contains not only @xmath16 , but also a macroturbulent velocity and an instrumental broadening .",
    "we also incorporate into it a limb darkening coefficient .",
    "we used a gaussian profile to fit the lines of the thorium - argon ( thar ) lamp .",
    "we found a fwhm of 0.09  defines the instrumental broadening for this spectral region .",
    "the fwhm varies from 0.0918 to 0.0921  from the redmost to the bluemost lines , and the synthesis code is insensitive to this small a change .",
    "we estimated macroturbulence ( @xmath23 ) according to @xcite for active stars and using b - v from @xcite . using estimates of limb darkening from @xcite , were able to derive @xmath16 to within about 0.7  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we estimated stellar radii ( @xmath24 ) from @xcite using derived @xmath18 , although we acknowledge that the stellar radii will be somewhat increased by the higher metallicity of the hyades .",
    "metal enrichment increases the opacity in the convection zone . according to hydrostatic equilibrium , as opacity",
    "is increased , the change in pressure as a function of optical depth will decrease , causing a slightly larger radius . for the purposes here ,",
    "an estimate of @xmath24 based on solar metallicity will suffice .",
    "using @xmath11 measured from this work , we were able to estimate the rotational axis inclination ( @xmath17 ) of each star .",
    "the sin@xmath17 values are listed in table 4 . adopting generous errors of 0.3 days for @xmath11 and 0.05 r@xmath22 for @xmath24 , and model dependent errors of 100 k for @xmath18 , 0.3 km s@xmath3 for @xmath23 and 0.1 km s@xmath3 for @xmath15",
    ", we note that the determination of sin@xmath17 is known to within 17% for hd  26736 and hd  26767 and 24% for hip 13806 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is useful in indicating the most probable plane for planetary orbits , flagging possible planet occultation candidates ( though errors on @xmath17 make this a blunt tool ) , and giving the general orientation of the star ( guiding first - guess positions for the location of active regions ) .",
    "it is interesting first to compare our results with prediction from the models of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 amplitude ( @xmath25 ) due to a single spot goes as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 if we assume spot latitude of 0@xmath6 , @xmath28 , and an average limb darkening coefficient of 0.6 .",
    "@xmath29v is the photometric amplitude in the v filter ( here , we use the photometric amplitude in the strmgren @xmath2 filter as an approximate substitute ) .",
    "we list @xmath30 and @xmath25 in table 4 .",
    "figure 3 shows our results for @xmath25 , the predicted amplitude of @xmath1 due to spottedness , versus the observed @xmath8 velocity amplitude .",
    "note that the @xmath25 values are about a factor of two lower than @xmath8 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "a very small part of this disagreement may come from the use of the @xmath2 filter as opposed to the v filter , but we believe most of difference arises for two reasons .",
    "first , the @xcite spot models we used predict the maximum contribution @xmath1 for a given @xmath30 ( due to a single , equatorial spot on a @xmath28 star ) . considering multiple spots with the same total @xmath30 or a different @xmath32 (  3.2 )",
    "will only reduce the predicted @xmath25 further .",
    "however , the @xmath30 values we used were _ also _ derived assuming single spots ; thus the true @xmath30 may be larger than table 4 suggests . in the general case of multiple spots",
    ", one must model the full @xmath10 and @xmath1 curves . beyond this",
    ", the presence of significant amounts of plage on our targets ( as implied by , e.g. , ca ii hk emission ; @xcite ) , indicates another possible source of @xmath1 fluctuations .",
    "thus , we must consider the possibility of multiple spots and plage contributing to the complex @xmath1 curves .",
    "based on the above argument , in the case of multiple spots , relations connecting the rms _ scatter _ in @xmath10 and @xmath1 might be more useful than the amplitude .",
    "although the data are still limited , there appears to be a trend between the rms scatter in @xmath10 ( @xmath33 ) and the rms @xmath1 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath34 versus @xmath33 of the observed data , including hd  166435 , hd  19632 and hd  192263 .",
    "a simple linear least squares fit yields @xmath34[m s@xmath3 ] = 3600@xmath36 + 2.29 .",
    "since when @xmath33=0 this implies @xmath37 m s@xmath38 , the internal error of the @xmath1 data , the fit further supports the idea that much of the @xmath34 in these stars is due to spots .",
    "the effects of dark starspots on the measured @xmath1 have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "plage , areas of relatively strong magnetic fields and activity which are optically bright , pose greater difficulties for modeling . unlike spots , where the dominant effect is simply a strong reduction in the local continuum , in plage the alteration of normal convective motions by strong magnetic fields",
    "is not hidden from view by low surface brightness . to model the effects of plage we use the models presented in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we use observed solar bisectors taken in plage and quiet regions at several limb angles as proxies for the bisectors of stellar intensity profiles , @xmath39 .",
    "these proxies were then used to  warp \" and shift symmetric @xmath39 profiles computed in a simple milne - eddington model atmosphere .",
    "we then employed the now asymmetric quiet and plage @xmath39 s to construct model stellar flux profiles for stars with any desired @xmath16 , orientation , and plage geometry .",
    "spots were modeled similarly , except that profiles inside spots were assumed to be symmetric .",
    "the centroid of the resulting profile was used to define @xmath1 for the model .",
    "we do not intend to present here a rigorous analysis of the spot and plage contributions to @xmath1 ; this is left for a future paper .",
    "our aim is only to ( 1 ) show that simple spot / plage models can explain details of the rv , @xmath2 and h@xmath40 variation beyond merely their amplitude and rms ; and ( 2 ) argue that it is thus _ plausible _ that spot and plage contribute significantly to the observed @xmath41 variations .",
    "our best fit solutions are not unique , and only indicative of a class of viable solutions under our chosen set of ( hopefully physically reasonable ) simplifying assumptions .",
    "since the data are also taken over an extended period ( @xmath04 months ) , the best fit parameters necessarily represent time - averages of the related physical properties .",
    "this is not entirely unrealistic : active longitudes on active stars are known to persist for years ( e.g. , jetsu 1996 ) and even solar active longitudes can be quite long - lived ( berdyugina & usoskin 2003 ) .",
    "time averages therefore do have some relevant physical meaning . since the plage models are based on solar line bisectors , we focused on the most solar - like of our hyad targets , hd  26736 .",
    "our assumptions are as follows .",
    "the most significant one is that the spot / plage reside at latitudes @xmath42 ( near the subobserver @xmath43 for hd  26736 ) , which yields close to the maximum effect for a given region area .",
    "we adopt a spot temperature of @xmath44 k ( similar to the sun ) , corresponding to a fractional continuum difference in spots at 5000  ( relative to the quiet photosphere ) of @xmath45 = @xmath4690% .",
    "additionally , for simplicity , we took the fractional continuum difference in plage ( also relative to the quiet photosphere ) , to be @xmath47 .",
    "a linear limb - darkening coefficient @xmath48 was adopted , and the regions were assumed circular .",
    "we first attempted to model the observed @xmath10 from hd  26736 , successively adding features of varying radius and longitude to fit @xmath10 .",
    "since we have adopted @xmath49 , spots must completely account for the observed @xmath10 .",
    "we then apply the resulting spot sizes and positions to compute a model for spot - induced @xmath1 variation . by not",
    "_ fitting _",
    "@xmath1 , but rather letting the observed @xmath10 drive the modeling , we ensure that the resulting @xmath1 model is consistent with @xmath10 but does not attempt to  explain \" features which are not due to spots . for our assumed @xmath50 ,",
    "a single spot spans only a phase range @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "5a ) and thus can not alone describe the photometry .",
    "the @xmath10 variation could be reasonably well described with two features ( see table 5 for their properties ; fit rms @xmath52 = 0.00394 ) we find an optimum  background \" unmodulated brightness of @xmath53 ( due to the pristine photosphere plus any uniform spot component ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 model agrees fairly well for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , but there are some discrepancies elsewhere .",
    "the discrepancies are strongest around phase @xmath56 , where the differences between @xmath1 and the spot - only model are @xmath57 m s@xmath3 . adding a third spot",
    "could partly correct this , only to introduce new fitting errors to @xmath1 around @xmath58 , and errors in @xmath10 near @xmath59 .",
    "the remaining systematic differences between the spot - only model and @xmath1 could be due to plage , our assumptions ( especially the restriction on @xmath50 ) , or even potentially a planet .",
    "to investigate the first possibility , it is useful to have a plage diagnostic analogous to @xmath10 .",
    "as our het spectra do not contain the traditional plage indicator ca ii h & k , we constructed a substitute from the h@xmath40 profile as follows .",
    "first , telluric features were removed by ratioing the hd  26736 data with a scaled spectrum of a rapidly rotating a star , whose broad h@xmath40 feature was removed with a cubic spline fit . the average flux in a 2.15  interval centered on the h@xmath40 core was then ratioed with the average flux in a nearby , nearly line - free  continuum \" segment ( 5  centered at 6602 ) to form an h@xmath40 index @xmath60 .",
    "this index showed a small but significant modulation at @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "5a and 5b reveals that the plage emission areas are not coincident with the spots : the @xmath62 curve maximum is shifted from the @xmath10 minimum , and there are features in @xmath62 not obvious in @xmath10 ( e.g. , the enhancement near @xmath63 ) .",
    "next , in a fashion similar to the spot - modeling we added plage regions until the the @xmath62 data was reasonably well fit .",
    "we assumed that the h@xmath40 emission is limb - brightened with @xmath64 .",
    "an estimate for the intrinsic plage emission strength per unit area , @xmath65 , was also needed .",
    "there has been relatively little work using h@xmath40 as an activity diagnostic in low - to - moderate activity g and k stars .",
    "@xcite found the minimum flux for an early g star in a 1.7  bandpass under the h@xmath40 core ( expressed as an equivalent width ) is @xmath66  .",
    "his most active target , @xmath15 uma b ( g5v , @xmath67d ) observed with a slightly different bandpass , showed @xmath68   above this baseline level .",
    "if we assume the latter represents a  saturated \" chromosphere star ( @xmath691 ) and the former a completely inactive star ( @xmath70 ) , we find ( after correcting for resolution and bandpass differences ) @xmath71 for a plage at disk center with an area of 10% of the visible surface . with these assumptions we found good fits came for a  background \" @xmath72 ( due to the photospheric h@xmath40 and any uniform plage / network component ) .",
    "we note , however , that there is a trade - off between plage brightness and area , i.e. , fits to @xmath62 are equivalent for @xmath73 constant .",
    "thus , changes in @xmath65 affects plage areas and thereby the plage contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "a minimum of 3 regions were required ( see table 5 ; @xmath74 = 0.00219 ) ; the positions of the model spots and plage are also indicated in fig .",
    "5 . the resulting plage - induced @xmath41 ends up being rather small relative to the spot contribution ( model amplitudes of @xmath75 m s@xmath3 compared with @xmath76 m s@xmath3 ; fig .",
    "the inclusion of the plages ( at @xmath42 ) does not significantly alter the agreement between the resulting @xmath1 model and the data : the rms between them is @xmath77 = 29.1 m s@xmath3 .",
    "including plage makes the agreement slightly worse around @xmath78 by the plage , but slightly better near @xmath79 ; significant discrepancies remain ( fig .",
    "5d ) . whether these discrepancies show any systematic trends ( suggesting a possible underlying planetary signal ) must await more rigorous modeling , in particular relaxing the assumption of @xmath80 for all regions .",
    "we leave this for a future paper .",
    "this initial search for short - period planets in the keck hyades survey has instead turned up several lines of evidence pointing to @xmath1 variations driven by magnetic activity .",
    "first , the photometric and the @xmath1 variations show similar periodicities ( fig . 1 ; table 1 ) ; the one star studied here in h@xmath40 ( hd  26736 ) shows a similar periodicity in that activity diagnostic as well ( fig .",
    "the @xmath1 amplitudes increase with the @xmath10 photometric amplitudes in a way consistent with ( though smaller than ) predictions of a simple single - spot model ( * ? ? ?",
    "the rms scatter in @xmath10 and @xmath1 also show a linear relationship ( fig .",
    "this correlation is potentially quite useful as a simple way of estimating @xmath81 from photometry .",
    "more data must be collected before we can predict @xmath81 from @xmath82 with confidence ; the relationship may depend on other properties / parameters .",
    "once refined , though , such a correlation may be of use to rapidly help flag  problem \" stars which will require more careful analysis to confirm planets , to screen out such stars from search lists , or to estimate what fraction of a given star s",
    "@xmath81 is likely due to activity .",
    "the phase shifts between the @xmath1 and @xmath10 curves clearly seen in at least two of the stars ( hip  13806 and hd  26736 ) are also consistent with a spot origin for much of the @xmath1 variation . to see this ,",
    "consider that the perturbation from a single , black spot at @xmath83 on a star ( with @xmath84 and no limb - darkening ) scales as @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 is the phase angle measured from the sub - observer meridian @xmath87 ) while photometry varies as @xmath88 .",
    "the minimum light ( at @xmath89 ) is shifted from the maximum @xmath41 ( at @xmath90 ) ; the actual shift will depend on details of the limb - darkening and active region geometry .",
    "hip  13806 and hd  26736 ( fig .",
    "1 ) both show this pattern of @xmath1 maxima preceding light minima .",
    "the case of hd  26767 is less clear ( two @xmath1 near @xmath91 are discrepant ) , but if one identifies the primary maximum with the feature near @xmath92 , it also follows the pattern . @xcite also see this phase shift in hd  166435 .    finally , beyond these more qualitative connections of @xmath1 with spots and plage",
    ", we have also demonstrated that the @xmath1 variations can be modeled directly . by first modeling the observed photometry and h@xmath40 emission and using the inferred spot and plage locations and sizes in simple models of these regions @xmath1 properties",
    ", we can explain a significant fraction of the @xmath1 variation of vb 15 in detail ( fig .",
    "given internal errors of @xmath93 ( the constancy of the comparison stars ) and @xmath94 , our fits to @xmath10 and @xmath62 are reasonably successful with two spots and three plages , respectively ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 models are less successful in explaining all the velocity variations ( @xmath97 m s@xmath3 ; @xmath98 ) but is able to account for @xmath9950% of the variance in the @xmath1 data . some of the discrepancies are undoubtedly due to our simplifying assumptions , such as all regions placed at @xmath42 .",
    "some less obvious implicit assumptions ( e.g. , that all spots and all plages are identical in how they act on @xmath1 , that the solar plage bisectors used as proxies are representative of stellar plage ) may also be important . still , despite the fact that the modeling presented here is simplified and certainly not definitive , we believe that it argues that a combination of spot and plage can explain many of the @xmath1 fluctuations seen in hd  26736 . by analogy , we suspect that many of the @xmath1 variation seen in the other targets can be similarly explained by activity .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 `` jitter '' in hd  26756 without corresponding @xmath10 changes or strong periodicity might be the result of rapidly evolving plage dominating the @xmath1 perturbations .",
    "young stars present distinct problems for the search for short - period planets .",
    "our work shows that photometric confirmation along with good activity measurements are a very helpful check to insure the viability of short - period planetary candidates .",

    "it is important to note , however , that most of the strongly _ periodic _ power will be concentrated on distinct surface / activity timescales : @xmath11 , differential rotation , active region growth / decay , active longitude growth / decay ( including  flip - flops \" ; see e.g. , jetsu , pelt , & tuominen 1993 ) , and magnetic cycle .",
    "planets with orbital periods well separated from these timescales will be much easier to detect and confirm .",
