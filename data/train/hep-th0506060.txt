    "one of most important and interesting properties of black strings is the classical instability which was discovered by gregory and laflamme @xcite .",
    "however , at this stage , we have not obtain the clear answers for what is the final state of the instability .",
    "however , the positivity of the energy of the spacetimes , that is , whether there is the lower bound of the energy of the spacetimes , or not , might give us the information about the stability of them or the final states .",
    "for an example , the schwarzschild black hole with negative mass is unstable under the metric perturbation , and if the positivity of the energy holds , then the spacetimes with negative mass would have naked singularity somewhere .",
    "a sufficient condition for the stability of spacetimes is that its energy saturates a lower bound on the energy of all field configurations satisfying the same boundary conditions .",
    "it is known that some charged extreme black hole solutions saturate a lower bound such a bound , which is the bogomol nyi - type bound @xcite .    in a class of four dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes , the trial to show",
    "the positivity of the adm energy had been made of by a lot of authors .",
    "however , they proved it in the only special cases . finally , shoen and yau @xcite succeeded in giving a complete proof on the positivity of the adm energy in asymptotically flat spacetimes , which can be applied whether there is a black hole or not .",
    "the more elegant and simpler proof was given by witten and nester @xcite , who used the spinorial method , when there is no horizon .",
    "the introduced spinor is the solution of dirac - witten equation and is asymptotically constant at spatial infinity .",
    "gibbons et .",
    "@xcite extended witten s arguments to black hole spacetimes containing an apparent horizon without assuming anything about the interior region of a black hole .",
    "they integrated the dirac - witten equation over a sapcelike hypersurface with the boundaries the spatial inifinity and the horizon and applied stokes s theorem there .",
    "the term over the apparent horizon as an inner boundary arise in addition to the surface term over the spatial infinity , which coincides with the adm 4-momentum . since this spinor boundary term over the apparent horizon becomes proportional to the expansion of null geodesics on the apparent horizon",
    ", it vanishes . as a result ,",
    "the discussion of gibbons et .",
    "al . becomes equal to that of the original witten s and the adm mass also becomes positive in the presence of a black hole .",
    "the adm mass in a @xmath0-brane spacetime or a black string will diverge because the spatial @xmath0 directions or the direction of the black sting are infinite in extent and it is given by an integral over the spatial infinity ( with its topology @xmath1 ) which encloses the @xmath0-brane .",
    "therefore , in such a spacetime the adm mass is not well - defined conserved charge in general except for the cases where they are compactified .",
    "the proof of positivity of such compactified cases have been already given @xcite .",
    "through this paper , we consider the conserved charges from asymptotic killing - yano tensors , which was introduced by kastor and traschen @xcite .",
    "this charge is called y - adm charge and gives us good physical interpretation of the mass density rather than that of a total mass of the spacetime . in the previous work @xcite , we investigated the positivity of y - adm mass density in @xmath2 brane spacetimes , which are assume to be transverse asymptotically flat to the @xmath2 brane .",
    "as results , we could establish the positivity in the two special cases ; ( a ) conformally flat cases or algebraically special spacetimes and ( b ) cases where there exists translational killing vector field along the string .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the positivity of the y - adm mass density in transversely asymptotically flat black string spacetimes containing an apparent horizon , using witten - nester s spinorial technique . due to the presence of an horizon , the spinor boundary term over the cross section of the horizon and the transverse space arises , as is seen in the proof of gibbons et .",
    "if this boundary term vanishes , we can establish the positivity of the y - adm mass density in the above cases ( a ) and ( b ) from the results in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "we will show the sufficient conditions for the horizon surface term to vanish , which is the cases where ( a ) the apparent horizon becomes null .",
    "therefore , if at least , the black string spacetimes satisfy the conditions either ( a ) , or ( b ) and ( a ) , then the positivity of y - adm mass density is assured .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "surface ] , we will show that the spinorial boundary term over the cross section of a black string and the transverse space becomes proportional to the expansion of the cross section rather than the horizon , unlike the proof of gibbons et .",
    "al . @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : vanish ] , we give the sufficient conditions for this surface term to vanish on the apparent horizon . in section [ sec : sum ] , we will summarize the results .",
    "we assume that the black string spacetime @xmath3 containing an apparent horizon is @xmath4 dimensions and transverse asymptotically flat , which means asymptotically flat in the direction transverse to the black string but always not in the direction parallel to it .",
    "we also assume that the spacetime is foliated by time slices @xmath5 with normal timelike vector field @xmath6 , and that each timeslice @xmath5 is foliated by the submanifolds @xmath7 binormal to vectors @xmath6 and @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is the vector field pallarel to the black string , satisfying the normalization @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "let us assume the codimension two surface @xmath7 which is the transverse space to the black sting ) is foliated by the codimension three surface @xmath11 normal to the transverse radial directional vector field @xmath12 satisfying the @xmath13 and @xmath14 . at transverse spatial infinity",
    "we take @xmath15 . in this spacetime",
    ", there exists the asymptotic killing - yano tensor @xmath16 , by which we can define the y - adm mass density as the surface integral over the transverse spatial infinity @xmath17 @xcite , as seen in fig.1 .",
    "the full spacetime metric can be written in the form    @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the induced metrics on the submanifolds @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we use the quantities @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig:1 ]     is the transverse space which has the boundary @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath17 denote the cross section of the black string and transverse space @xmath7 and the transverse spatial infinity , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 is foliated by codimension three surfaces @xmath25 which coincide with @xmath17 on the inner boundary and @xmath24 on the outer boundary .",
    "the transverse space @xmath7 is assumed to be asymptotically flat at the transverse spatial infinity @xmath17 . ]    to prove the positivity of the adm energy , witten @xcite used the spinorial method , which consists of the two steps .",
    "as the first step , he showed that the surface integral of so - called nester 2 form @xmath26 over the spatial infinity ( codimension two surface ) coincides with the adm mass ( exactly speaking , adm @xmath27-momentum ) . the following step is to transform this surface integral into the volume integral , using stokes theorem , and to relate it to eintein tensor equal to the energy momentum tensor satisfying the dominant energy condition . to discuss the positivity of y - adm mass density ,",
    "let us introduce the nester @xmath28-form @xcite defined as @xmath29 in analogy with the nester @xmath30 form in the proof of the positive energy theorem @xcite , where @xmath31 is asymptotically constant spinor in the transverse direction and satisfies the dirac - witten equation @xmath32 .",
    "however , in the reference @xcite , we dealt with the transversely asymptotically flat @xmath2 brane spacetimes with no horizon since the in general , in the case with a horizon there exists singularity in the interior region and so the discussion in the reference @xcite can not be applied to the spacetimes with horizons , such as , black string . in the latter case",
    ", we need add the surface integral over the cross section @xmath33 of horizon and transverse space as the inner boundary to the surface integral over the transverse spatial infinity . to explain this ,",
    "let us begin with the volume integral over the transverse space @xmath7 ( see the equation ( 19 ) in the reference @xcite ) ,    @xmath34.\\label{eq : sur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we choose the cross section of the horizon and the transverse space as an inner boundary in analogy with the reference @xcite , then as the result of applying stokes theorem to the left hand side in the above eqaution , we obtain the following eqaution ,    @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the first term in the left hand side coincides with the y - adm mass density @xmath36 , following the discussion in the reference @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the second term in the left hand side appears due to the presence of the horizon @xmath33 , which implies the cross section of the horizon and the transverse space .",
    "the right hand side becomes positive in at least , two special cases , ( 1 ) conformally flat cases or algebraically special spacetimes and ( 2 ) cases where there exists translational killing vector field along the string , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to estimate the surface term on the horizon @xmath33 and to investigate when this surface term vanishes .",
    "this term is    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the volume element on the cross section of the horizon and the transverse space .",
    "we have the following relation between the projection into @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath25 of the @xmath42 dimensional spinor covariant derivatives @xmath43 and the intrinsic @xmath44 ) dimensional , @xmath45 dimensional , and @xmath46 dimensional spinor covariant derivatives @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 respectively , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the extrinsic curvatures of the submanifolds @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the indexes @xmath53 and @xmath54 run @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the real part of @xmath58}=b^{\\hat 0\\hat 1 \\hat 2}$ ] becomes    @xmath59    let us impose the boundary condition with respect to the spinor on the cross section @xmath33 of the horizon as follows @xcite ,    @xmath60    where we used the fact that the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix @xmath61 are @xmath62 and therefore , in the above , we restrict the freedom of the spinor to the half .",
    "under this condition , we find that the first term in the left hand side in the equation ( [ eq : bb ] ) vanishes , since    @xmath63    similarly , the second term in the left hand side in the equation ( [ eq : bb ] ) also vanishes , because @xmath64 anticommute with @xmath61 , that is , @xmath65    then we obtain the simple expression with respect to the suface integral over the horizon @xmath33 as follows , @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we find that this integrand coincides with the expansion @xmath67 of the cross section and black string and the transverse space , since we can observe that the above term coincides with @xmath67 defined as    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is outgoing null vector . therefore , we observe that when this expansion of the cross section @xmath33 of the horizon and the transverse space @xmath7 , the surface term on the cross section of the horizon vanishes .",
    "we should note that unlike the proof in the references @xcite , in general , this term does not vanishes on the apparent horizon , since @xmath67 is not expansion of horizon but that of the cross section of the horizon and the transverse space .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the surface integral over the cross section of the horizon and the transverse space generally does not vanish on an apparent horizon unlike the proof of gibbons et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "as seen in the below , a sufficient for this surface term to vanish is the cases where the apparent horizon becomes null surface . in this section",
    ", we will show that the above surface term vanishes on an apparent horizon in the above conditions .      following hayward s discussion @xcite ,",
    "an apparent horizon is null if and only if null energy condition hold , the shear and the normal energy density vanishes @xcite ( exactly speaking , this is a necessary and sufficient condition for a so - called _ trapping horizon _ defined by the closure of a @xmath70 dimensional surface foliated by marginal surfaces on which @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the lie derivative along the ingoing null direction and @xmath74 is the expansion of the ingoing null geodesics , becomes null surface . in this paper",
    ", the apparent horizon means this trapping horizon . ) .",
    "we can show that if an apparent horizon is null surface , the above surface term vanishes .",
    "the expansion of out going null geodesics on the apparent horizon is defied as    @xmath75    on the other hand , the shear of the horizon can be expressed in the form    @xmath76    whrere @xmath77 and the equation ( [ eq : expansion ] ) was used .",
    "therefore , since @xmath78 , we can show that on the apparent horizon @xmath79 in combination with the equation ( [ eq : ex ] ) .",
    "we will mention when the physical situations where an apparent horizon becomes null would realize . in stationary black string spacetimes ,",
    "the apparent horizon would coincide with the killing horizon of the black string .",
    "however , even in non - stationary cases , such situation would occur , if there exists the apparent horizon and there is no radiation across and along the horizon . here",
    "we should note that in non - stationary cases , since the apparent horizon is generally inside the horizon , we have to replace @xmath33 with the cross section @xmath80 of this apparent horizon @xmath81 and the transverse as the inter boundary in the equation ( [ eq : sur ] ) in order that the inner boundary vanishes .",
    "finally , in combination with the previous work , we will mention the sufficient conditions for the positivity of the y - adm mass density to hold black strings whose boundary condition satisfie transverse asymptotically flatness .    _",
    "the y - adm mass density becomes positive if a transversely asymptotically flat black string spacetime which contains an apparent horizon and satisfies the dominant energy condition follows the below conditions ; +   + ( 1 ) either conformally flat cases or algebraically special spacetimes , or there is a translationary killing field along the black string , i.e. the black string is uniform and ( 2 ) the apparent horizon becomes null . _",
