    "the vortex matter of cuprate superconductors has a rich phase diagram in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ( see e.g.  ref . ) .",
    "not long after the discovery of the cuprate superconductors it has been established that there are at least two phases , a fluid ( liquid or gas)@xcite phase at high temperatures and fields and a solid ( lattice or glass ) phase at low temperatures and fields .",
    "it was shown that the transition between these two phases is of first order , at least in low fields up to a critical point .",
    "@xcite recently , it has been shown@xcite that there are two distinct solid phases . in low fields",
    "the vortices form a quasi - ordered lattice in a so - called bragg glass,@xcite which is stable against the formation of dislocations . in higher fields they form a highly disordered , entangled@xcite solid .",
    "the nature of the high field phase is not well understood .",
    "it could be anything from a highly viscous fluid to a vortex glass with unbounded barriers against vortex movement.@xcite we will simply term it `` glass '' henceforth .",
    "the high - field glass phase is caused by weak , random and uncorrelated disorder due to point - like defects , such as oxygen vacancies.@xcite this type of disorder is present even in the most pure crystals of cuprate superconductors .",
    "strong , correlated disorder due to extended defects , such as twin boundaries or columnar irradiation defects , has got a different influence on the vortex matter and can lead to additional phases , e.g.  a  bose glass \" phase@xcite located at low fields.@xcite correlated disorder may not be present in all crystals . in the following , when we simply speak of `` disorder '' ,",
    "we are referring to weak random point - like disorder .",
    "the pinning induced by the disorder has two effects on the vortex lattice.@xcite firstly , it localizes vortices by trapping them in low - lying metastable states , hardening the solid .",
    "secondly , it promotes transverse wandering of vortices from their ideal lattice positions .",
    "the mechanism of the destruction of the lattice , triggering the transition to the glass phase,@xcite is very similar to the mechanism of melting at higher temperature .",
    "similar to the way the lattice looses translational order and melts into a fluid , when thermal fluctuations become of the order of the lattice spacing , it looses translational order and `` melts '' into a glass , when the disorder - induced line wandering becomes of the order of the lattice spacing . in both cases",
    "the stability against the formation of topological defects , such as dislocations , is lost .",
    "the massive proliferation of dislocations accompanying the destruction of translational order leads to an entangled configuration of vortices , i.e.  topological order is lost as well . in highly anisotropic superconductors ,",
    "the lattice - glass transition may fall together with a decoupling between the layers,@xcite of which there is some evidence in bi@xmath9sr@xmath9cacu@xmath9o@xmath10 ( bscco).@xcite this is not expected in less anisotropic systems , like yba@xmath9cu@xmath11o@xmath12 ( y123).@xcite there is considerable evidence that the phase transition between lattice and glass , like the melting transition between lattice and fluid , is of first order@xcite and is even a continuation of the melting line.@xcite    since the solid - solid transition is an order to disorder transition with the disordered phase located at high fields , the transition line @xmath4 can be expected to shift to lower fields with the introduction of additional disorder in the crystal structure .",
    "calculations@xcite of @xmath6 , based on a lindemann criterion , confirm this expectation . indeed",
    ", there seems to be a correlation between the position of @xmath6 and the purity of a sample , as can be seen by comparing different measurements on y123 crystals .",
    "also , studies of the effect of electron irradiation on the transition between lattice and glass have found a systematic decrease of @xmath6 with increasing irradiation dose.@xcite    an alternative way to introduce structural disorder into a system is to partially substitute an element of the compound .",
    "however , the generally varying level of oxygen within samples , which is difficult to measure and control , constitutes a serious problem .",
    "yba@xmath9cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( y124 ) is a compound very well suited for studying the dependence of @xmath6 on chemically introduced disorder , because in this compound the oxygen content is fixed to 8 per unit cell .",
    "another advantage of y124 is that twinning , which leads to strong correlated disorder , does not exist in this compound.@xcite finally , y124 has got an intermediate anisotropy @xmath13,@xcite which , as compared to y123 , shifts the glass phase down to fields more easily attainable experimentally . to exclude or at least to minimize concurrent sources of disorder in the system",
    "it is advisable to use single crystals for any measurements .",
    "if vortices are not ordered in a lattice , they can better adapt to the local pinning potential .",
    "therefore , critical current densities can be expected to be higher in the glass phase .",
    "high critical currents in high magnetic fields are desirable for many applications .",
    "investigations of the disordered solid state and it s boundaries are thus very important in view of practical applications . many irradiation studies found that critical current densities can increase by orders of magnitude upon irradiating a sample.@xcite studies on compounds with chemical disorder have also found increases of @xmath14 and even the development of a second peak.@xcite    in this work , we study the influence of a substitution of isovalent sr for ba in yba@xmath0sr@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 on the lattice to glass transition line @xmath4 , the irreversibility line @xmath15 and the critical current densities @xmath14 . in the paper , we are going to give evidence of an enhancement of the maximum critical current density in the glass phase @xmath5 by more than an order of magnitude due to structural disorder introduced by sr substitution .",
    "the change of the vortex matter phase diagram due to the influence of relatively strong quenched disorder will be presented .",
    "[ samples ] single crystals of y124 , with and without sr substitution , were grown using a high - pressure technique , the details of crystal growth are reported elsewhere.@xcite single crystals of yba@xmath0sr@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with sr content up to @xmath16 or 32% were obtained .",
    "the crystals were checked with edx and their structure analyzed with single crystal x - ray analysis.@xcite the transition temperatures @xmath17 of the crystals were determined with a squid magnetometer by temperature sweeps ( both zero field and field cooled ) in an applied field of @xmath18 .",

    "the curves shown were measured in a magnetic field of @xmath20 , under zero field cooled conditions . ]    [ magn_exp ] measurements of the dc magnetization were performed with a quantum design mpms5 squid magnetometer , additional measurements were performed with a non - commercial squid magnetometer with a sensitivity better than @xmath21 .",
    "all measurements were done with the magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath22-axis of the crystal and generally the magnetization was measured at fixed temperatures as a function of the external field being swept up and down . after each change of the field",
    ", we waited for a time of @xmath23 before measuring the magnetic moment four times using a scan length of @xmath24 .",
    "the relatively short scan length was chosen to ensure maximum homogeneity of the applied field and was necessary to ensure a sufficient resolution of all features of interest discussed below .",
    "the wait time of @xmath23 was chosen to avoid effects of the initial relaxation of the field of the superconducting magnet without extending the time of measurements too much . throughout the paper @xmath7",
    "denotes the applied field , i.e.  no correction of the demagnetization was made .",
    "this is not a problem , however , since the magnetization is always much smaller than the external field except in the low field range , which is not the particular interest in this paper .",
    "the critical current density @xmath14@xcite was calculated from the width of the hysteresis loop using an extended bean model.@xcite the irreversibility field @xmath25 was determined as the field where increasing and decreasing field branches of the @xmath26 hysteresis loop meet , or equivalently as the field where the critical current density vanishes",
    ". a uniform criterion of @xmath27 was used . for the crystals",
    "studied it corresponds to a criterion of in between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which is not far from the accuracy limit of our experimental setup .",
    "in the following we will discuss the influence of sr substitution on disorder and structure , critical current densities , the irreversibility line , and the transition from lattice to glass .",
    "sr substitution increases the disorder in the structure , evidenced for example by a dramatically increased nqr line width.@xcite no evidence for an introduction of correlated disorder was found and since twin boundaries are absent in yba@xmath0sr@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 the assumption of the disorder in our crystals to be purely random and point - like seems justified .",
    "the sr substitution also induces a variation of structural parameters , causing a charge redistribution .",
    "bond valence sum calculations and nuclear quadrupole resonance measurements indicate a transfer of holes from oxygen to copper atoms in the cuo@xmath9 planes and from copper to oxygen in the chains.@xcite the charge redistribution can explain the increase of @xmath17 upon substituting more than 10% sr for ba .",
    "the initial decrease of @xmath17 may be due to the increased site disorder.@xcite    an important structural modification due to sr substitution is a decrease of the thickness of the blocking layer @xmath30 separating the superconducting cuo@xmath9 planes , linear with sr content .",
    "a substitution of 32% sr for ba causes the blocking layer to shrink by about 1%,@xcite which leads to an improved coupling between the superconducting planes .",
    "torque measurements indeed indicate a corresponding decrease of the anisotropy @xmath31.@xcite      figure [ fig2]a ) shows one of the half hysteresis loops measured .",
    "the second peak is clearly discernible and dominates @xmath26 . in all crystals ,",
    "the second peak was observed over the whole temperature range measured , even just @xmath32 below @xmath17 .",
    "the form of the hysteresis loop and thus of @xmath33 can be linked to the different phases of vortex matter . in low fields hysteresis",
    "is small and the hysteresis loop is rather anisotropic , which indicates that the major source of hysteresis in low fields is not of bulk origin ( see also sec .  [ il_disc ] ) .",
    "the origin of the low bulk hysteresis is probably that the vortices are in the lattice phase in small @xmath7 .",
    "weak random point disorder is not effective in pinning an ordered dislocation - free lattice of vortices .",
    "the magnitude of the critical current density in low fields gives an indication of the degree of disorder in the system .",
    "for our samples , measurements of the critical current density at reduced temperatures of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in fields of @xmath36 and @xmath37 suggest that the disorder is increased monotonically up to the highest substitution level measured , with the biggest rate between @xmath38 and @xmath16 .     between them",

    "when , upon rising the field , the lattice is destroyed in the glass state and the vortex system has an additional `` dislocation degree of freedom'',@xcite individual vortices can much better adapt to local minima in the pinning potential .",
    "this results in a higher effective pinning force and thus a higher critical current density @xmath14 and relaxation barrier.@xcite additionally , the entanglement itself was also suggested to increase critical current densities , due to an increased intervortex viscosity,@xcite provided the barriers to flux cutting are high enough.@xcite in our case , a steep rise of the magnetization occurs just below the kink field , denoted @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) ( see also sec.[hss_disc ] ) .",
    "local magnetic measurements on a bscco crystal revealed a sharp increase in @xmath41 , followed by a monotonic decrease afterwards.@xcite the so - called `` second peak '' ( or `` fishtail '' ) effect in bscco can thus be accounted for by the order - disorder transition . on untwinned y123 crystals ,",
    "a similar sharp increase in @xmath41 was observed by local magnetic measurements,@xcite but contrary to the situation for bscco , @xmath41 continues to increase upon increasing field , although with a slower rate , which leads to a sharp kink in @xmath26 . only in even higher fields",
    "the magnetization starts to decrease with increasing field .",
    "independently of vortex matter phase transitions , the second peak or fishtail effect in y123 was attributed to a crossover from elastic to dislocation - mediated plastic creep.@xcite this mechanism is closely connected to the lattice - glass transition though , since in the lattice phase dislocations are strongly suppressed while in the glass phase dislocations proliferate , as mentioned above.@xcite from collective creep theory a rise of the experimentally observable critical current density with the field is expected,@xcite as long as elastic creep can be assumed and the bulk pinning is relevant . from the shape of the hysteresis loops shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] follows that in yba@xmath0sr@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 the situation is similar to the one in y123 . after rising the field even more , above @xmath25 ,",

    "the dependence of the hysteresis loop of an unsubstituted y124 single crystal on defects created by fast neutron irradiation was studied in ref .  .",
    "fast neutron irradiation leads to improved pinning properties due to collision cascades ( strongly pinning extended defects of spherical shape ) and agglomerates of smaller defects .",

    "the effect of fast neutron irradiation to remove the second peak may be understood from the different defect structure .",
    "the disorder resulting from the collision cascades is to some extent correlated and fast neutron irradiation can therefore create a bose glass phase in low fields .",

    "differences between @xmath25 of the different samples measured are relatively small , and the details depend on the temperature as well . now it is important to remember that bulk pinning is not the only source of magnetic hysteresis .",
    "there are additional contributions due to bean - livingston surface barriers@xcite and due to geometrical barriers.@xcite the significance of surface and geometrical barriers depends on several factors .",

    "the critical current densities depend , as discussed above , strongly on @xmath44 , and are very low for the unsubstituted crystal .",
    "indeed , while the hysteresis loops of substituted crystals are generally rather symmetric , this is not the case for the unsubstituted crystal , which is an indication that barrier hysteresis is more important than bulk hysteresis.@xcite another factor is the sample shape - bulk hysteresis depends linearly on the sample diameter , while the barrier hysteresis scales with the ratio of thickness to diameter .",

    "the thickness to diameter ratio varies from @xmath64 to @xmath65 for the crystals used in this study .",
    "finally , an important factor is the temperature , since the bulk hysteresis is depressed by thermal depinning , while the one due to geometrical barriers is less affected by temperature.@xcite in the second peak region , the main part of the hysteresis is clearly of bulk origin , as follows from the shape of the hysteresis loops ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , since the total hysteresis observed is simply the sum of bulk and barrier hysteresis , the irreversibility field may still be determined by surface or geometrical barriers , since the bulk hysteresis goes to @xmath66 faster at higher fields.@xcite in high fields , bulk critical current densities were found to go to zero exponentially.@xcite a linear relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath67 is indeed followed in the crystals we measured .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows this relationship for yba@xmath68sr@xmath69cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the figure shows also , however , that there are systematic deviations below a certain temperature dependent threshold of critical current densities . for higher temperatures the deviation appears at larger critical current densities",
    "this may indicate that the irreversibility lines are indeed influenced considerably by barrier hysteresis at higher temperatures .    .",
    "]    on the other hand , measurements of the influence of fast neutron irradiation on the high temperature part of the irreversibility field on a y124 single crystal found a slight decrease of @xmath25 upon irradiating the crystal.@xcite irradiation may reduce bean - livingston type surface barriers , but those are , like bulk pinning , strongly temperature dependent and were generally not found to be important near @xmath17 .",
    "geometrical barriers , on the other hand , should not change upon irradiation . as the irradiation did change the irreversibility field at high temperatures",
    ", it would indicate that @xmath25 at high temperatures can not be due to bean - livingston or geometrical barrier hysteresis .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the importance of barriers strongly depends on the sample shape and we can not be completely sure to what extent barriers influence @xmath25 , especially in the case of the unsubstituted crystal , where bulk pinning is very weak . in order to explain the effect of the sr substitution on the bulk properties , it is therefore advisable to compare @xmath15 at not too high reduced temperatures .",

    "because the pinning energy is increased upon introducing more disorder into the system , it would seem natural that the transition occurs at higher temperatures .",

    "this can be seen by comparing the phase diagrams .",

    "it is likely that the kink corresponds to the transition line from the lattice to the glass state of vortices . in ref .",
    "it was argued that the equilibrium phase transition corresponds to the kink in @xmath26 in decreasing field , while the kink in increasing field corresponds to the upper limit of metastability of the lattice phase .",
    "however , since the pinning is much stronger in the glass phase , the equilibrium transition can be expected to be located quite close to the upper limit of metastability .",
    "this was indeed found from the measurements of ref .. also in our case , while we have more data on the field increasing branch , the kink in @xmath7 decreasing was checked at representative temperatures and the difference in the two kinks was found to be rather small indeed ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "we should mention that the actual equilibrium transition is a little bit lower than the field of the kink in @xmath84 , which we call @xmath6 ( see fig.[fig10 ] ) .",

    "additionally , the difference between the onset of the second peak in increasing fields @xmath90 , defined as the minimum of the absolute value of the magnetization before the second peak , and the kink field @xmath6 can be explained by the existence of a region of metastability around the phase transition.@xcite recent experiments@xcite indicate that an abrupt change of the field injects a transient disordered vortex phase at the sample edges .",

    "what is more surprising is the apparent saturation of the influence of the additional disorder for a substitution level @xmath127 , while the maximum pinning force is still linearly increasing up to @xmath55 . in the case of weak point - like pinning @xmath128 , where @xmath99 is the disorder parameter and @xmath129 the defect density , is expected.@xcite it would seem natural to assume the defect density to be proportional to the sr substitution level @xmath44 .",
    "the blocking layer thickness on the other hand , which is the structural factor with the biggest influence on the anisotropy , decreases linearly with @xmath44.@xcite a large initial decrease of @xmath6 followed by an almost independence on @xmath44 is therefore difficult to explain .",
    "a downward shift of @xmath6 upon introducing more disorder was also found in electron irradiated crystals of bscco@xcite and y123.@xcite the notable difference between both of these irradiation experiments and sr substitution in y124 is that in both cases of electron irradiation there is no sign of any saturation of the disorder induced lowering of @xmath6 . as discussed above , the disorder induced by sr substitution",
    "is probably , even for the lowest substitution level of @xmath130 , already much higher than the disorder induced by the electron irradiation with the largest fluence measured in refs .   and .",
    "it may be that in our substituted crystals the disorder is already too big for the applicability of formulas derived for weak disorder .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams for yba@xmath131cu@xmath2o@xmath3 and yba@xmath132sr@xmath133cu@xmath2o@xmath3 are contrasted in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "the glass phase of yba@xmath132sr@xmath133cu@xmath2o@xmath3 has , as compared to yba@xmath9cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , expanded dramatically from a rather small part of the easily experimentally accessible phase diagram to the phase covering the biggest area in fields @xmath134 .",
    "the most dramatic shift is the lowering of @xmath6 , which is to be expected as the ( quasi-)ordered phase should become smaller upon introducing more disorder into the system .",
    "the region of metastability is much smaller for the substituted crystal , indicating that strong disorder tends to reduce over - heating and especially under - cooling effects .",
    "we speculate that this may be connected to our observation that for unsubstituted y124 with very weak disorder @xmath6 depends strongly on the exact amount of disorder , while for substituted y124 with rather strong disorder it almost does not depend on the exact level of disorder . in real crystals ,",
    "the disorder density depends on the position on a mesoscopic scale .",
    "et al._@xcite observed that for melting supercooling exists only at local maxima of the transition field . in a first approximation the width of metastability can be linked to the difference between maximal and minimal transition fields within the sample . in our case",
    "the same spatial variation of disorder should produce a much bigger variation of the local transition field for the unsubstituted crystal than for the substituted ones .",
    "we investigated the influence of structural disorder , introduced by a substitution of sr for ba in yba@xmath9cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , on the critical current density at elevated fields and on the borders of the glass phase of vortices .",
    "we stress that the disorder introduced chemically by means of sr substitution is random and point - like , rather than disorder due to extended defects .",
    "this is shown by the hysteresis loops keeping their general form , similar to the case of electron irradiation and unlike the case of neutron irradiation , where at least partially the effect is to introduce extended defects .",
    "our main conclusion is that the introduction of even a small amount of disorder into very clean systems changes the phase diagram drastically by lowering the order - disorder transition line @xmath4 and also changing it s temperature dependence .",
    "when the disorder reaches a certain threshold , however , introducing additional disorder does not continue this tendency . with other words , in highly disordered systems ( including probably most systems with partial chemical substitutions ) , the vortex matter phase diagram is relatively robust with respect to variations in the exact degree of disorder .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the rather small variation of the measured kink location as an indication of the order - disorder transition at fixed reduced temperature for any sr substitution level @xmath135 , especially as compared to the corresponding transition in a clean , unsubstituted crystal . that the disorder is still increasing with increasing substitution level for @xmath82 is indicated both by an increasing nqr line width@xcite and increasing critical current densities at low fields and the maximum pinning force density .    in strongly disordered systems ,",
    "metastability is less important than in very clean systems and especially the region of undercooling of the glass phase is much smaller .",
    "this might be linked to the observation that the position of the transition line does not depend much on the exact amount of disorder in strongly disordered systems , since variations of the disorder density on a mesoscopic scale do not produce large positional differences of the local transition field in this case .",
    "similar to the robustness of the phase diagram above a disorder threshold , both the maximum pinning force density and the maximum critical current density in the glass phase increase initially with increasing disorder , the critical current density increases by an order of magnitude upon substituting 10% sr .",
    "but they then show saturation behaviour , i.e.  the pinning force density and critical current densities can be raised only up to a certain point by introducing random point - like disorder .",
    "this may be relevant for possible applications where high critical current densities are required .",
    "it should be noted that current detailed theories of the order - disorder transition generally assume the disorder to be very weak .",
    "our measurements indicate that in systems with a high amount of disorder , the phase diagram and in particular the order - disorder transition differ qualitatively from the weak disorder case .",
    "theoretical investigations beyond the weak disorder limit would be very helpful .",
    "both the pinning of unsubstituted y124 and sr substituted y124 is likely to be of @xmath115 , rather than @xmath102 type , indicated by the temperature dependence of the order - disorder transition at intermediate temperatures .",
    "for the substituted crystals this can be expected , since there are variations of @xmath17 upon sr substitution . however , the exponential - like temperature dependence of the order - disorder transition of substituted crystals at low temperatures is also emphasized .",
    "the dependence can not be linked to the influence of surface barriers , at least not in any straightforward way , the same dependence of all significant fields ( onsets and clearly discernible kinks for both field directions ) suggests it is a true bulk property of the transition .",
    "we stress that the observed temperature dependence is at odds with currently published theoretical formulas .",
