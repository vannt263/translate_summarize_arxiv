    "in a system at thermodynamic equilibrium , a particle responds to a gentle push by moving on average toward the direction of the applied force .",
    "therefore the mean - velocity to force ratio , called mobility , is a positive quantity . in general , linear response coefficients are positive in equilibrium because the structure of the fluctuation response relations involve positive correlations between observables and the entropy that perturbations would produce  @xcite .",
    "far from equilibrium there is more variability .",
    "for example , thermal conductivities that are not monotonous in the external forcing have been found  @xcite .",
    "if a pushed particle starts to go slower by increasing the force we have the phenomenon of negative differential mobility ( ndm )  @xcite if the particle responds by drifting against the force , we speak of absolute negative mobility .",
    "the latter behavior has been observed in models subject to ratchet effects  @xcite , in systems driven by periodic forces  @xcite and for driven janus particles in corrugated channels  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on ndm .",
    "negative differential conductivity was discovered in the 60 s and realized in gunn diodes  @xcite and other semiconductors at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "other examples of ndm are listed in ref .",
    "a recent application of ndm is the sorting of soft matter colloidal particles  @xcite .    for common overdamped diffusion",
    ", ndm is expected when particles surrounding environment contains shallow barriers , called `` traps '' hereafter , in which the particle driven by an external force might spend more and more time upon an increase of the force . for this reason ,",
    "the mobility of the particle may actually decrease rather than increase if the force is raised .",
    "an example of this effect was given by particles diffusing within a percolating cluster  @xcite ( an instance of hopping process in disordered media  @xcite ) , in which traps are represented by the dangling ends and all portions with concavity against the direction of the force .",
    "a pedagogical exemplification of this `` getting more from pushing less '' phenomenon was then given by zia and coworkers  @xcite . in a two - lanes jump system that can be solved exactly",
    ", ndm emerges when one lane contains a hook that can trap the particle .",
    "the ndm may be described  @xcite from the point of view of a recently developed linear response theory for general nonequilibrium systems  @xcite . in this context , ndm emerging in simulations of ring polymers impaled by rods of a lattice with defects  @xcite might explain irregular migration speeds in experiments comparing linearized and circular dna plasmids  @xcite .",
    "ndm was also found for particles diffusing in a crowded environment  @xcite .",
    "one expects to observe ndm if there is a form of trapping due to a specific coupling between the tracers ( tagged particle , polymer , etc . ) and their environment .",
    "jamming of particles , such as in kinetically constrained models  @xcite , may also be seen as a form of mutual trapping .",
    "however , just a density of obstacles does not say anything straightforward about such propensity to meet traps if the features of the obstacles and of the tracers are not explicitly specified . yet , using the formalism of mesoscopic jump systems , it was recently proposed  @xcite that ndm should be a generic feature for particles strongly pulled in crowded environments .",
    "we believe that shifting the focus from the trapping mechanism to the role of crowding is not functional to a better understanding of ndm . to support our point , in this paper we show that some of the results presented in  @xcite , and more in general the appearance of ndm , may depend crucially on the choice of microscopic jump rates .",
    "moreover , we use some simple models to show that crowding may be uncorrelated with ndm or even anti - correlated .",
    "this occurs when too many tagged particles are introduced in the system , so that traps are saturated .",
    "as in previous studies , the results are exposed in the context of markov jump processes .",
    "the states of the system are discrete and evolve with jumps taking place in continuous time .",
    "more specifically , we have in mind subsets of the square lattice where the particle may occupy free sites and jump to the first neighbors if the transitions are allowed .",
    "forbidden transition may occur if the target of the jump is already occupied or if there is an idealized wall separating the two sites involved in the jump .",
    "we use a force @xmath0 parallel to the @xmath1-axis and periodic boundary conditions in this direction .",
    "hence , we monitor the average velocity @xmath2 in the @xmath1 direction . the differential mobility @xmath3 becomes negative in the regions where @xmath4 decreases for increasing @xmath0 .    for the sake of simplicity we use a unit temperature times",
    "boltzmann constant combination , @xmath5 , and unit spacing between sites of the square lattice .",
    "this means that the principle of local detailed balance  @xcite is met if the jump rate @xmath6 is related to the jump rate @xmath7 of the reversed transition by @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the energy associated to the configuration @xmath10 .",
    "when a particle is subject to a constant force @xmath0 and the jump @xmath11 is in the direction of the force , the energy difference becomes the work done by the force , @xmath12 .",
    "when the jump is orthogonal to @xmath0 , simply @xmath13 .",
    "there are many ( actually infinite ) choices of the jump rates that satisfy the local detailed balance condition .",
    ".jump rates of the particle on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 , so that all rates @xmath16 for @xmath17 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 pushing particles to the right .",
    "tracers that may follow @xmath0 by eventually never stepping back against it are drawn as empty circles ( only one in this case ) .",
    "( b ) the same for @xmath22 .",
    "( c ) mean velocity vs.  force ( same parameters ) for several particle densities . ]    for model a it is not difficult to find conditions of low @xmath23 where ndm is present as well as conditions with high @xmath24 where ndm is not observed , see the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_p ] . the latter state of normal mobility arises because the behavior of tracers emerges as an average of two typical conditions , one of tracers stuck in traps , and one of tracers free to move because all available traps are occupied by other tracers . for several values of @xmath25",
    "we find that the contribution from running tracers determines a normal mobility for sufficiently high values of @xmath26 .",
    "this is expected to occur when there are more particles than the average number of traps [ e.g.  as in fig  [ fig : rho_p](b ) ] . if instead @xmath26 is low enough , trapping is still the dominating behavior [ see fig  [ fig : rho_p](a ) ]    this model therefore is an example where increased crowding leads to the disappearance of ndm . again , this strengthens our point that the link between crowding and the mobility of particles is not straightforward . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical results may be correctly interpreted at least qualitatively in terms of saturation of trapping effects .",
    "also in this case one could devise simpler systems where the mechanism of filling of all the traps is more easily detected .",
    "for example , in the two - lanes models where one lane is occupied by `` hook '' states that act as traps  @xcite , we have numerically verified that ndm is present only if the number of tagged particles is at most equal to the number of traps .",
    "we have presented results from some simple models suggesting that the phenomenon of ndm in many cases can be ascribed to the presence of long living traps that catch the strongly pushed traced particles .",
    "there is instead no one to one correspondence between crowding and ndm . in particular , according to our results , it seems far fetched to draw conclusions from either simulations or from mesoscopic theories if these rely on the specific choice of the jump rates .",
    "the choice of transversal jump rates normalized so that they decrease with the force is quite popular but it needs to be understood and justified . for example , starting from the concept of brownian motion of a particle in a fluid , we do not see how the increasing force could lead to a weaker transversal motion , namely to a diffusion coefficient in the fluid that depends on a transversal @xmath0 . also for particles diffusing by jumping in a pattern of energy minima",
    "it is not general to find a decrease of transversal motion generated by an applied force .",
    "think for example of a particle density within a minimum , at the microscopic level of description ( while the mesoscopic level is the one of jump systems describing the energy minimum as a single state ) .",
    "if the applied force shifts the maximum of this density closer to the energetic saddle points that connect to nearby states , also in transverse directions , we would witness a case where the force would actually enhance the transversal motion .",
    "it seems that such scenario is in principle as likely as that where the transversal motion is depressed by the force .",
    "hence , transversal jump rates that decrease exponentially with the applied force should be tested in parallel with other choices , keeping in mind that any specific system might be a realization of one of these choices .",
    "our examples also show that focusing on the density of objects responsible for the crowding is not a stand - alone strategy .",
    "one needs first to determine whether the tagged mobile objects ( e.g. particles or polymers ) might become more stuck by the crowded environment when the pushing force is increased .",
    "furthermore , it is also relevant to check if on average the traps are at least as many as the tagged particles .",
    "the study of ndm in more complex simulations than those considered so far ( such as the condition outlined in the previous section where multiple tracers coexists ) should help further clarifying these issues .",
    "of course this is just part of a broader scenario , where kinetic constraints , jamming , glassy dynamics , alternating external forces , self - propulsion , etc .",
    "furnish many more mechanisms leading to negative mobility .",
