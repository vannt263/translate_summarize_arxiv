    "abell 1674 ( hereafter a1674 ) was listed in the cluster catalogs by @xcite and @xcite as a richness class 3 cluster .",
    "the redshift of a1674 was determined to be 0.1055 by @xcite from the redshift of 1 member galaxy , and is cited in the aco catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "struble and rood ( 1999 ) reported the redshift to be @xmath0 based on the measurement of 2 member galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity measured with rosat is @xmath17 within @xmath18mpc in the @xmath19kev band ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the hubble constant @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the metal abundance is reported with the asca and xmm - newton observations ( @xcite and katayama , hayashida and nishino 2005 ) , and is less than @xmath23 .",
    "these two parameters are significantly lower than the typical values of clusters of galaxies of this richness class ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they thus suggested that metals have not yet been supplied to the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , and speculated that a1674 is at an early evolutional stage ( @xcite ; katayama , hayashida and nishino 2005 ) .",
    "we report the result of the suzaku satellite ( @xcite ) observation using the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis , @xcite ) to investigate these unusual x - ray properties of the icm in a1674 .",
    "the observation was performed for an effective exposure of 68 ks on 2006 december 16 .",
    "suzaku has four xis cameras ; three of the xis ( xis  0 , 2 , 3 ) employ front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds , and a back - illuminated ccd is installed in the other ( xis  1 ) .",
    "since xis  2 has been out of function from 2006 november 9 , we use the remaining three xis ( xis  0 , 1 , 3 ) . the observation was performed with either the normal @xmath24 or @xmath25 mode .",
    "these data are combined .",
    "figure  [ a1674_with_region ] shows the x - ray image of a1674 .",
    "in addition to the bright central emission , faint point - like sources in the east , and diffuse emissions in the northeast and southwest are observed .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectra using xselect ver.2.4 .",
    "the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) was produced with the ftool _ xisnxbgen _ ( @xcite ) , using the night - earth data taken before and after 150 days of our observation .",
    "the nxb was subtracted from the source spectra , while the x - ray background ( xb ) was included in the spectral fitting .",
    "the response matrix files were generated by the ftool _",
    "xisrmfgen_. the auxiliary response files ( arfs ) were generated by _ xissimarfgen _ with the observed image of a1674 in the @xmath26kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "we analyzed the spectra in the @xmath27kev and the @xmath28kev bands for the fi ccds and the bi ccd , respectively .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectrum of the central region of the radius of @xmath29 with the center position at @xmath30 .",
    "the spectra after the nxb subtraction are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the spectral model includes the x - ray background ( xb ) in addition to the icm .",
    "the xb consists of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , the milky way halo ( mwh ) and the local hot bubble ( lhb ) .",
    "the spectrum of the cxb is assumed to be a _",
    "powerlaw _ model with the parameters presented by @xcite .",
    "the emissions from the mwh and lhb are modeled with a xspec model _",
    "apec _ ( @xcite ) with metal abundances of @xmath31@xmath5 .",
    "we report the metal abundances relative to the solar values in @xcite .",
    "we apply the _ apec _ model for the icm spectra .",
    "the absorption is given by the _",
    "wabs _ model ( @xcite ) , where the hydrogen column density is fixed to @xmath32@xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all together , our spectral model is @xmath34*{\\it{wabs}}+{\\it{apec}}({\\rm lhb})$ ] .    in the fitting , we first fixed the redshift to be @xmath0 as suggested by the optical data ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ spec_center ]  ( a ) shows the best - fit models .",
    "the best - fit temperature and metal abundances of the icm are @xmath35kev and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with the previous observations ( @xcite ; katayama , hayashida and nishino 2005 ) .",
    "however in fig .",
    "[ spec_center ]  ( a ) , we see a clear line - like residual at around @xmath37kev , possibly redshifted iron k - shell line .",
    "we then allowed the redshift to be a free parameter .",
    "the best - fit model is shown in fig .",
    "[ spec_center ]  ( b ) , while the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : center_result ] .",
    "this fit well reproduces the line - like structure at around 5.5kev , as the redshifted ( @xmath38 ) iron k - shell line .",
    "using the f - test , decrease in @xmath39 is highly significant with a null hypothesis probability of @xmath40 .",
    "this is the first detection of the iron k - shell line from a1674 .",
    "the metal abundance of the center region is @xmath4@xmath5 , which is not unusual for clusters .",
    "obviously , the statistics of the previous x - ray observations ( @xcite ; katayama , hayashida and nishino 2005 ) were too poor to determine the reliable redshift and metal abundance .",
    "since the x - ray redshift of the a1674 center region ( @xmath38 ) is different from that determined optically , we examine the spatial distribution of optical galaxies near and around a1674 . figure  [ a1674_with_sdss ]  ( a ) shows the galaxy distribution on the suzaku x - ray image of a1674 taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) database , while fig .  [ a1674_with_sdss ]  ( b ) is the redshift - sorted galaxy distribution made from the sdss spectroscopic survey list .",
    "although the sdss spectroscopic survey is not deep enough to include most of the galaxies with @xmath41 in this region ( @xcite ) , we see three galaxies with @xmath42 in the center region . on the other hand , eight galaxies with @xmath43",
    "are found in the southwestern region .",
    "we find two separated structures in the x - ray emission in the southwestern region .",
    "we thus define two extraction regions , sw1 and sw2 , marked by the solid blue line in fig .",
    "[ a1674_with_sdss ] .",
    "the center coordinate of sw1 and that in sw2 are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the x - ray emissions in sw1 and sw2 are more extended than the point - spread function ( psf ) of the x - ray telescope on board suzaku ( @xcite ) .",
    "we employ similar data reduction and analysis for the spectra of sw1 and sw2 regions to those of the center region ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "since the x - ray emission in each sw region is far fainter than that in the center region , contamination ( pile - over ) from the center region should be taken into account .",
    "we estimate it by using the best - fit spectral parameters in table  [ tab : center_result ] and the arfs of which source region is set at the center region .",
    "we also have to take the mutual contamination between sw1 and sw2 into account .",
    "the spectra of sw1 and sw2 are thus fitted simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ spec_sw ] shows the nxb - subtracted spectra of sw1 and sw2 with their best - fit models .",
    "the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : sw_result ] . in the sw1 region ,",
    "the he - like fe l - shell emissions around 1kev determine the redshift to be @xmath46 , which is consistent with @xmath0 obtained from the optical observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature and metal abundance are @xmath7kev and @xmath8@xmath5 .",
    "the temperature is significantly lower than that in the center region .",
    "the metal abundance is marginally different from that in the center region but is typical for clusters .    on the other hand",
    ", the x - ray spectrum of the sw2 region shows no apparent line - like structures .",
    "this is partly due to its lower surface brightness than the sw1 region and also to the strong contamination from the center region ; the contamination from the center region is comparable to the intrinsic emission from the sw2 regrion . we thus conclude that the x - ray spectral property of the sw2 region is hard to be constrained with this observation .      spatial structures of the extended x - ray emission in the center region and the sw1 region are examined by fitting their radial profiles with a @xmath47-model ( @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure is also needed to evaluate their x - ray luminosities .",
    "radial profiles were derived from the x - ray image shown in figure  [ a1674_with_region ] .",
    "the radial profiles derived in this way are those convolved with the suzaku psf .",
    "we thus estimate the suzaku psf with the ftool _ xissimarfgen _ and convolve a @xmath47-model with the psf to fit the radial profile , as was done by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ radial ]  ( a ) shows the radial profile in the center region with the best - fit model , whose parameters are in the column 1 of table  [ tab : radial_result ] .",
    "we confirm the emission of the center region extends at least to 1.3mpc from the center .",
    "the core radius @xmath48 and @xmath47 is @xmath6kpc and @xmath49 , respectively . according to the analysis of a large sample of clusters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath48 and @xmath47 are in @xmath50kpc and in @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "it indicates that @xmath48 and @xmath47 of the center region are within these ranges .",
    "figure  [ radial ]  ( b ) shows the radial profile of a1674-sw with the best - fit model , whose parameters are in the column  2 of table  [ tab : radial_result ] .",
    "we find the @xmath47-model component dominates the background emission up to @xmath52mpc in the sw1 region .",
    "the core radius @xmath48 and @xmath47 of the sw1 region is @xmath9kpc and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these values are also consistent with other clusters .",
    "we find some deviation of the radial profile in the sw1 region from the best fit @xmath47-model .",
    "the profile is better reproduced with a double @xmath47-model .",
    "although we employ the single @xmath47-model fit in the following discussion , we note that the integrated x - ray luminosity based on it is lower than that with the double @xmath47-model fit by about 10% .",
    "as described in sec .  [ sec : results ] , we find two different redshifts , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , from the two separate regions ( the center and sw1 regions ) in the field of a1674 .",
    "this redshift difference corresponds to @xmath54@xmath55 , which is too large to be attributed to a bulk motion in one cluster .",
    "we therefore can safely conclude that a1674 consists of at least two independent clusters overlapping along the line of sight . in the following discussion",
    ", we name these clusters a1674-c and a1674-sw .",
    "we conventionally call a1674-sw a cluster in this paper , although we may had better call it a group of galaxies , considering its lower temperature of @xmath7kev . note also that we were not able to constrain the spectral properties of the faint x - ray emission in the sw2 region .",
    "our hypothesis that a1674 is separated into two independent clusters of a1674-c and a1674-sw is supported by the spatial distribution of galaxies between @xmath43 and @xmath42 as shown in fig .",
    "[ a1674_with_sdss ]  ( b ) .",
    "although the sdss spectroscopic survey is not deep enough to detect many galaxies with @xmath56 ( @xcite ) , most of the galaxies measured in the sdss spectroscopic survey are spatially separated into two groups of @xmath42 ( a1674-c ) and @xmath43 ( a1674-sw ) .",
    "the separation is , however , not clear , and there are some overlaps .",
    "for example , we find one galaxy with @xmath42 in the sw1 region .",
    "the galaxy is at a distance of 1.24mpc from the center of a1674-c . assuming the distribution of galaxies follows the x - ray radial profile we measured ,",
    "the ratio of the number of galaxies inside and outside 1.1mpc should be about 3:2 , which is statistically consistent with what we observe .",
    "we hence consider that this galaxy is most likely a member of a1674-c . on the other hand , we find one galaxy with @xmath43 in the center region .",
    "the galaxy is at a distance of 1.26mpc from the center of a1674-sw .",
    "since we only confirmed the x - ray emission of a1674-sw up to @xmath52mpc , the galaxy may not be a member of a1674-sw but a field galaxy .",
    "deeper spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the field of a1674 are needed for further discussions of optical properties of these clusters .",
    "x - ray properties ( temperature , core radius , and @xmath47 ) of a1674-c and a1674-sw are within the range of those observed for other clusters , as described in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of each cluster is evaluated with their radial profiles described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : radial ] .",
    "if we extrapolate the radial profile up to @xmath12mpc , we obtain the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath14kev within 2mpc ) of a1674-c to be @xmath57 , while that of a1674-sw is @xmath15 .",
    "if we limit the outer radius to be 1.3mpc and 0.4mpc for a1674-c and a1674-sw , respectively , the x - ray luminosities of these two clusters are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "expected luminosities within 2mpc from the observed temperatures ( 3.8kev for a1674-c and 2.0kev for a1674-sw ) using the @xmath16 relation ( equation ( 4 ) in @xcite ) , are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these are consistent with the observed luminosities within a factor of 2 , which is comparable to or smaller than the scatters of the data points found in @xcite .",
    "this is another support for our hypothesis .",
    "new clusters of galaxies were serendipitously discovered or identified with suzaku observations , as reported by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in either case ,",
    "an iron emission line in the x - ray spectra and an extended x - ray emission are the key to identify the source as a cluster .",
    "the discovery of the new cluster of galaxies a1674-c is similar to those previous cases but from the previously cataloged cluster a1674 .",
    "we performed a spectral and spatial analysis for the cluster of galaxies a1674 in separate regions observed with suzaku .",
    "we discovered the he - like fe k - shell line from the center region of this cluster for the first time , and find that the x - ray spectrum yields a higher redshift of @xmath1 than 0.1066 that determined in the optical observations .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray spectrum of the sw1 region is fitted with a redshift of @xmath2 , primarily determined with the he - like fe l - shell lines .",
    "the galaxies in the sdss spectroscopic survey data also shows two separate component in the redshifts and spatial distributions .",
    "we hence conclude that a1674 consists of two independent clusters of galaxies , a1674-c and a1674-sw , overlapping along the line of sight .",
    "the gas temperature , metal abundance , core radius , @xmath47 of a1674-c are @xmath3kev , @xmath4@xmath5 , @xmath6kpc , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "those of a1674-sw are @xmath7kev , @xmath8@xmath5 , @xmath9kpc , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these parameters are within the range of those observed in other clusters .",
    "the x - ray luminosities evaluated for a1674-c and a1674-sw are consistent with those expected from their temperatures by using the @xmath16 relation described in @xcite within a factor of 2 .",
    "these are additional supports for our conclusion that a1674 consists of two independent clusters of galaxies .",
    "previous optical determination of the redshift of a1674 based on measurements of two member galaxies by @xcite turned out to be not enough for this kind of overlapping system .",
    "x - ray observations with high signal to noise ratio are efficient to find different redshift components in clusters .",
