    "ap stars are chemically peculiar stars that range from early - b to early - f spectral types with the majority having detectable magnetic fields with strengths of a few @xmath1 to a few @xmath2 g ( @xcite , according to whom @xmath3 per cent have mean longitudinal fields greater than 400 g ) .",
    "the study of ap stars with strong magnetic fields has ramifications for several other branches of astrophysics .",
    "the interaction among strong magnetic fields , atomic diffusion and energy transfer in ( or above ) the upper atmospheres of non - degenerate stars has direct implications for observed stellar abundances and for the instability of stellar pulsations in @xmath4cephei and sdb stars .",
    "the very different magnetic field strengths , orientations and geometries , as well as the great variety of surface abundance distributions for ap stars , therefore makes them particularly informative .",
    "the magnetic field geometry , determined from maps of longitudinal magnetic field strength versus rotation phase , generally agrees with an axisymmetric dipole , although strong deviations from this do occur , e.g. the quadrupole field configuration of hd37776 ( @xcite ) .",
    "typically , the magnetic axis is significantly inclined to the rotation axis , hence these stars are called oblique rotators .",
    "many ap stars are known to have surface spots , indirectly observable from photometric light variations or spectroscopic line strength variations over a rotation cycle .",
    "these stars are known as @xmath5cvn stars after the prototype of that name @xcite .",
    "their light and line strength variations are a consequence of abundance spots that are often associated with the magnetic poles .",
    "the rotation period of ap stars is typically relatively long  of the order of several days to years , and even in some cases decades , as determined from their magnetic field variations .",
    "slow rotation is a requirement for the atmospheric atomic diffusion that gives rise to the observed spectral peculiarities , since rapid rotation generates turbulent meridional circulation that inhibits diffusion .",
    "interestingly , atomic diffusion processes can give rise to observably stratified atmospheres in some ap stars , and probably all rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars .",
    "examples of studies of atmospheric abundance stratification in the cool roap star subgroup are given by @xcite .",
    "these studies are in agreement with each other . in general ,",
    "fe is concentrated by gravitational settling in the deeper observable layers in the photosphere around @xmath6 ; the pr and nd line - forming layers are concentrated by radiative levitation high in the atmosphere at @xmath7 , a level that is chromospheric in the sun , and in the roap stars is above the line - forming layer of the narrow core of the h@xmath0 line at @xmath8 , which is itself above the fe line - forming layer .",
    "many other elements show similar behaviour to these examples .",
    "doppler imaging studies of ap stars show that the spots associated with the magnetic poles are typically caused by abundance concentrations of rare earth elements .",
    "overabundances globally are several orders of magnitude compared to normal abundance stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and may reach a factor of @xmath9 in the spots , as shown by the doppler imaging study of the roap star hr3831 by @xcite , and as shown in this paper for hd99563 . as a result of these strong abundance anomalies , line - blocking changes the temperature gradient at the magnetic poles of ap stars ; flux is redistributed usually from the blue to the red , so that rotational light variations in visible light occur in antiphase for short and long wavelength observations , along with obvious spectral line strength variations .",
    "importantly , the rotational variations  whether magnetic , spectroscopic or photometric  allow the precise determination of the stellar rotation period .",
    "with the surface of some ap stars resolvable by doppler imaging , and atmospheric depth being resolved because of stratification , ap stars  and particularly the roap stars  offer the only opportunity for 3-d studies of stellar atmospheres for any stars other than the sun .      a subgroup of ap stars , the rapidly oscillating ap stars ( roap ) , exhibit rapid oscillations with periods of @xmath10min .",
    "their frequencies are considerably higher than those typical for @xmath11sct stars with whom they overlap in location inside the classical instability strip of the hr diagram . at present ,",
    "only 40 roap stars are known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , although several photometric surveys have searched for rapid pulsation in ap stars , such as @xcite . for a ( non - exhaustive ) list of spectroscopic studies of roap stars , see kurtz , elkin & mathys ( 2006a ) .",
    "the roap class characteristics are therefore poorly constrained .",
    "as they share the same region of the hr diagram with the ( photometrically established ) non - oscillating ap ( noap ) stars , the selection of new roap candidates is difficult and mostly leads to null - results for both spectroscopic studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; freyhammer , elkin & kurtz 2008b ; @xcite ) and for the photometric surveys listed above .",
    "the pulsations of roap stars are described well by the oblique pulsator model , where the pulsation axis is assumed to be aligned with an oblique magnetic field axis ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or derived to be offset from both the rotational and magnetic axes @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this model and assumed that convection was suppressed locally in the magnetic polar regions .",
    "they showed that pulsation aligned with the magnetic poles is unstable to the axisymmetric , nonradial high - order modes observed in roap stars , mainly through excitation by the opacity ( @xmath12 ) mechanism acting in the hydrogen ionization zones in these regions .",
    "they also considered the effect of local he settling , and concluded it is not the primary process responsible for the high - frequency pulsation .",
    "nevertheless , their model finds he to be deficient in the observable atmosphere at the magnetic poles .",
    "while he is not directly observable at visible wavelengths at the effective temperatures of the roap stars ( @xmath13k ) its gravitational settling implies that the magnetic poles are hydrogen - rich .",
    "we return to this point in section  [ hcore ] where we show evidence to support it .",
    "statistical studies of the roap stars can be intriguing and informative , e.g. in the comparison of the roap and noap stars by @xcite .",
    "but with only 40 such stars known the class characteristics are still not well - defined .",
    "therefore , the greatest progress at present is to be made by in - depth studies of individual roap stars , such as that for hr3831 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and hr1217 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the related problem in the pulsational studies of @xmath11sct stars . despite being the most abundant type of variable star",
    ", the major breakthroughs have been obtained through individual studies such as that of fgvir @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath11sct stars , as for the roap stars , the question of when pulsation modes are exited or not remains unanswered for physically similar stars  why do only some of these stars pulsate and what is the underlying physics ?",
    "the many null results among roap candidate stars strongly suggest that either the pulsation properties are not fully known ( i.e. amplitude ranges or pulsation geometry ) or the selection of candidates is too coarse .",
    "individual studies of known roap stars are therefore important ( presently the only option at hand ) to study the roap properties in detail . some examples of enlightening studies include that of @xmath14equ that clearly demonstrated the trends for pulsational amplitude with vertical stratification of chemical elements ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , doppler imaging of hr3831 ( kochukhov 2004 , 2006 ) , and the study of line bisector variability by @xcite and a new type of upper atmospheric pulsation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .      to first order , pulsations in many roap stars are oblique axisymmetric dipole ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) p  modes .",
    "nevertheless , it has been clear for decades that normal modes described by single spherical harmonics are insufficient to explain fully the mode geometry in these stars .",
    "uniquely , the oblique modes of the roap stars allow them to be viewed from varying aspect , giving detailed information about the mode geometry .",
    "an early example was the study of hr1217 by @xcite who showed the presence of alternating even and odd degree p  modes , with the odd modes being consistent with oblique dipole modes , and the even modes not being consistent with either radial or quadrupole modes .",
    "this was confirmed by the more extensive whole earth telescope study of this star by @xcite . even for roap stars with single pulsation modes , in the best observed cases  such as hr3831",
    " it can be shown that the single mode is a distorted oblique dipole mode ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "any deviation from spherical symmetry for a pulsating star will give rise to distorted modes . for",
    "the roap stars the dominant effect is the magnetic field , with contributions from the non - uniform abundance distributions and stellar rotation .",
    "the non - uniform abundance distributions are particularly important for spectroscopic studies  such as the one in this paper on hd99563 , and that of @xcite for hr3831  where concentrations of ions in spots mean that the pulsation mode is non - uniformly sampled with the rotation",
    ". however , photometric studies that more uniformly sample the mode geometry with rotation also show the distortions of the modes .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field on the oscillations of roap stars have been extensively studied theoretically , and there are ongoing investigations into this complex problem ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while generally the magnetic field effect on the oscillations is expected to be small , the theoretical results do lead to expectations of distorted modes .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the influence of the magnetic field on the pulsation geometry and found that not only can a dipole magnetic field explain the suppression of the observationally absent @xmath11sct modes , but it also leads to insufficiency of a single spherical harmonic to describe the pulsations angular dependency ; a series of spherical harmonics of different degrees @xmath17 are required .",
    "inclusion of magnetic fields in the study and interpretation of roap pulsations is therefore necessary and constitutes ` a formidable mathematical problem ' @xcite .",
    "@xcite continued the study of the effects of a dipole magnetic field on roap pulsations and showed again that the field stabilised low - order p  modes ( such as those excited in @xmath11sct stars ) for fields stronger than 1 kg , but that nonradial , high order distorted dipole , or quadrupole , p  modes remain overstable and are most likely to be excited in roap stars .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the current observations , as well as with the mounting observational and theoretical evidence for observable pulsation nodes in and above the photosphere in the magneto - acoustic layer .",
    "further , and most interestingly , saio modelled the latitudinal amplitude dependence for the roap case of hr3831 and found reasonable agreement with the observations by @xcite .",
    "saio s non - adiabatic analysis predicts ( his figure 10 ) a latitudinal dependence of amplitude that does not differ from a purely dipole mode photometrically , whereas spectroscopy s ability to distinguish potentially between horizontal and radial pulsation components may detect the relatively smaller horizontal component when studying stellar spots close to ( but not necessarily at ) the magnetic poles .",
    "saio s figure 10 demonstrates a reasonable agreement with observed latitudinal velocity amplitude variation for hr3831 , but predicts higher amplitude toward the magnetic axis than is observed .",
    "however , the formation layer of the nd lines used by kochukhov in his observations is far above the boundary of saio s models .",
    "@xcite also did not take into account the inhomogeneous nd surface distribution .",
    "the oblique pulsator model describes how nonradial pulsation modes seen from varying aspect with the stellar rotation show amplitude and phase modulation ( see the overview by @xcite ) that results in a frequency multiplet in an amplitude spectrum , centred on the pulsation frequency @xmath18 and separated by _",
    "exactly _ the rotation frequency @xmath19 .",
    "this exact splitting by the rotation frequency allowed kurtz ( 1982 ; see also @xcite ) to rule out the possibility that the observed multiplets can be explained by rotationally perturbed @xmath20-modes ( @xmath20 being the azimuthal order of a mode ) , which is the typical interpretation of frequency splitting observed in other ( non - oblique ) nonradially oscillating stars , as such rotational multiplets are split by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the rotation frequency , @xmath23 is a small constant dependent on the stellar structure , @xmath24 is the overtone of the mode and @xmath17 is its degree .    for oblique pulsation",
    "the amplitude ratio of the multiplet components contains information about the pulsation geometry ( assumed to be aligned with the magnetic geometry ) . in the case of a simple oblique dipole mode @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the inclination angle of the rotation axis , @xmath4 is the obliquity of the pulsation / magnetic axis relative to the rotation axis , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the observed amplitudes of the frequency triplet . for modes that are not purely dipolar , or vary in structure with atmospheric depth in the stratified roap stars atmospheres ,",
    "this constraint can depend on the atmospheric depth of formation of the spectral lines studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    despite the complex nature of roap pulsations in the presence of magnetic fields and an oblique geometry , the observational data have rich potential for asteroseismic inference .",
    "photometrically , multisite observations and space - borne observations allow the resolution of both the large and small frequency spacings and through them constrain the stellar dimensions and the interaction of the magnetic field and rotation with the pulsation modes .",
    "high - resolution time series spectroscopy allows the study of the pulsation geometry over the stellar surface ( through line profile variability ) and also vertically in the stellar atmosphere , through radial velocity measurements at different line bisectors , or through lines of elements located at different depths in the stratified atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the observations have begun to resolve the magneto - acoustic nature of the pulsations in these stars high into the atmosphere to levels that are unobservable in any other star but the sun .",
    "radial nodes are resolved in some stars such as hd137949 ( mkrtichian , hatzes & kanaan 2003 ; kurtz , elkin & mathys 2005c ) and possibly hd99563 @xcite .",
    "observed variation of pulsation phase with atmospheric depth shows the presence of running waves , and there is even an indication that shock waves are observed in the upper atmosphere of @xmath14equ ( @xcite ) , and by inference other roap stars with similar line profile variations .",
    "hd99563 was discovered to be a roap star by @xcite , pulsating in a 10.70-min mode .",
    "it is a visual binary with a 1.2mag fainter secondary at 1.79arcsec separation @xcite . a spectroscopic study by elkin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) confirmed the monoperiodic pulsation found from photometry , and found the pulsations to have extremely high radial velocity amplitudes for a roap star , such as 2.6  for  and up to 5  for eu and tm .",
    "for sake of clarity , we emphasize that _ monoperiodic _ refers to a single ( physical ) pulsation mode ",
    "e.g. , the frequency quintuplet detected by @xcite ( actually 5 components of a frequency septuplet ) are all associated with only a single mode with pulsation frequency @xmath18 ; the rest of the quintuplet describes the amplitude and phase modulation of the mode .",
    "elkin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measured a projected rotation velocity of @xmath29@xmath30  from a high - resolution spectrum , while from narrow - band strmgren photometric indices they estimated @xmath31k and @xmath32 ( cgs ) .",
    "furthermore , they studied variations in amplitude and phase for line bisectors , and from element to element . the demonstrably high amplitudes ( and",
    "thus high signal - to - noise , @xmath33 ) and rich and varied information content from using lines of different elements or with line depth , show hd99563 to be a particular interesting roap star for detailed study .",
    "@xcite carried out a photometric multisite campaign and found an equally spaced frequency quintuplet in hd99563 , for the pulsation frequency @xmath34mhz .",
    "they determined the rotation period to be @xmath35d and a time of pulsation amplitude maximum to be hjd2452031.29627 .",
    "the photometry showed , through application of the axisymmetric spherical harmonic decomposition method of @xcite , that the mode of hd99563 is dominated by a dipole component , with some contribution of an @xmath36 component ( i.e. , the mode is a distorted dipole ) .",
    "handler and collaborators combined photometry , a hipparcos trigonometric parallax and the temperature and surface gravity estimate by elkin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to constrain the basic parameters of hd99563 . under the assumption that the secondary star in the visual binary is a physical binary component and that the wide orbit indicates",
    "the stars have evolved separately , the estimated parameters of both stars must fit two stellar evolutionary models of the same age . by adopting @xmath37k and @xmath38 , they found for the primary @xmath39 , @xmath40 , an inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis @xmath41 , and a magnetic obliquity @xmath42 .",
    "this makes hd99563 especially interesting because of its high pulsation amplitude , its rotation that is fast enough for doppler imaging , and its ( for a roap star ) rare favourable orientation where both magnetic poles become visible throughout a rotation cycle .",
    "@xcite were the first to measure the magnetic field of hd99563 , finding a longitudinal field of @xmath43 g on hjd2452494.483 , or rotation phase 0.08 with respect to handler et al.s pulsation ephemeris .",
    "@xcite published another two measurements at rotation phases 0.07 and 0.09 showing @xmath44 and @xmath45 g , respectively .",
    "further , using the russian 6-m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( saoras ) , @xcite obtained 6 additional magnetic longitudinal field measurements near rotation phases 0.25 , 0.5 and 0.75 . with all 9 available measurements",
    ", these authors used the well - known relation for a dipolar magnetic field : @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath0 is the angle between the magnetic pole and the line - of - sight , @xmath26 is the rotational inclination , @xmath4 is the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic axis , @xmath22 is the rotation frequency , @xmath48 is the longitudinal magnetic field strength and @xmath49 is the polar field strength .    as can be seen from eq.[eq : mag2 ] , the mean magnetic field strength @xmath50 and the amplitude of the magnetic field variations @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 , from which @xmath4 can be constrained when @xmath26 is known .",
    "using the measured values for hd99563 , @xmath53 g and @xmath54 g , @xcite find an inclination of @xmath55 , and a magnetic obliquity @xmath56 ( 8490  for a 1@xmath57 range ) , which are similar to those determined by @xcite .",
    "the magnetic minimum coincides with the moment of maximum modulated pulsation amplitude ( @xmath58 hereafter ) , and similarly for the maximum half a rotation phase later ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is consistent with both magnetic poles being viewed from a similar angle and coming into view for almost the same duration ( requiring that either @xmath26 or @xmath4 be close to @xmath60 ) , and with the pulsation axis and magnetic axis being aligned .",
    "@xcite used doppler imaging to construct the first tomographic maps of pulsation velocity , surface abundance and magnetic field map for the roap star hr3831 . with observations obtained over a wide range in rotation phase for hd99563 , it will be possible to do this with higher precision for this star because of its very high amplitudes , and it will be possible to look simultaneously at the additional dimension of the atmospheric depth dependence of the velocities .",
    "kochukhov , as a first approximation , treated the analysis of hr3831 as if the atmosphere has a single pulsation layer .",
    "observations of hd99563 and other roap stars show the situation to be much more complex than this . disentangling the vertical and horizontal pulsation characteristics",
    "is a challenge , but one with rich rewards for the fields of asteroseismology , pulsation theory , magnetohydrodynamics , stellar atmosphere theory and atomic diffusion .",
    "hd99563 is one of only a few known roap cases where tomographic mapping through doppler imaging is possible , based on rotation rate and the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , observations over three nights ( most of the 2.91-d rotation period ) were scheduled from two sites simultaneously ",
    "subaru on mauna kea and vlt on cerro paranal  to attempt to collect spectra at high resolution in both time and dispersion to obtain a first picture of this star s photosphere , and to determine precisely its physical parameters . theoretically , the scheduled observations would have given us 70 per cent coverage of the rotation cycle , hence of the visible stellar surface .",
    "but due to bad weather , only one site contributed significantly to the pulsation study , and only some 40 per cent rotational coverage was attained .",
    "in this first of a series of papers on hd99563 , we are studying the horizontal pulsation geometry with the stellar rotation . a doppler imaging study of the surface abundance distribution of many ions and detailed modelling of the horizontal and vertical pulsation geometry is in preparation .",
    ".[tab : obslog]journal of vlt observations indicating nightly observing date ( ut ) , rotation phase with reference to a time of spectroscopic pulsation maximum , hjd2454171.43328 , heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) range , typical exposure time , number of collected spectra , and mean @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath33 ratios are based on the random noise in the continuum of consecutive spectra , or for single spectra based on predicted ratios .",
    "the 2004 data were re - reduced in same manner as the new data , and included in the analysis as they supplement the covered rotation phases .",
    "an additional 35 spectra were obtained with the hds spectrograph at the subaru telescope on 2007 march 12 and march 13 and combined into two average spectra at rotation phases @xmath61 and 0.56 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,>,^ \" , ]",
    "we have performed a first analysis of the pulsation of hd99563 based on one of the most comprehensive spectroscopic efforts on a roap star so far .",
    "we show that the pulsation is well - described by a single distorted oblique dipole mode , with different distortion terms for different elements . in the future",
    ", we will use these differences to make further inference concerning the pulsation velocity field  ultimately in 3-d . by using doppler imaging maps of the surface distribution of nd and eu ,",
    "we have identified two relatively concentrated spots near the magnetic poles . during rotation phases at magnetic crossover , line doubling in absorption features of these elements ( with each component relating to a spot )",
    "is considerable , and we show that the stellar photosphere at opposite sides of the star have mutual @xmath62 rad offset , again supporting the oblique dipole rotator geometry .",
    "these spots allow the study of the pulsation mode for only parts of the visible hemisphere of the star , and from varying aspect , an opportunity only possible for roap stars .",
    "remarkably , blue - to - red running wave features were found only near the rotation phases where the lines were doubled and the spots were seen at high aspect angle .    our study included a short data set we also obtained with uves on the vlt 3 years earlier ( elkin et al . 2005 ) , which after a minor revision of the pulsation frequency showed amplitudes and phases for h , nd and eu that in general are consistent with the new data .",
    "some roap stars exhibit short lifetimes of pulsation modes  in the most extreme case , hd60435 , the mode lifetimes are less than a week . the stability of hd99563 over a 3-yr time span simplifies the interpretation of the pulsations .",
    "this also suggests that it will be possible to merge future observations of the rotational phases not covered by our data for a more detailed study .",
    "we found a clear rotational variation in the radial velocities of the h@xmath0 line in addition to the pulsational variations which we interpret to be the first observational evidence of hydrogen overabundance at the magnetic / pulsational poles , as expected theoretically as a result of helium depletion .",
    "while we prefer this interpretation , alternatively , we found the first planet orbiting a roap star , a hot jupiter with a mass of 26 times the mass of jupiter . in future work we will model the h@xmath0 line radial velocity variations in detail to test our preferred hypothesis of hydrogen spots .",
