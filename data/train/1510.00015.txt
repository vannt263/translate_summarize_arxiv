    "when hot jupiters were first discovered @xcite , our understanding of planet formation and evolution was turned on its head . however , their existence made transit searches from the ground practical . although the first transiting planets were originally discovered from follow - up of rv candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the first detections from dedicated transit surveys followed soon after by tres @xcite , xo @xcite , hat @xcite , and wasp @xcite , all of which had the same basic design : a small telescope with a wide field of view to monitor many stars to find the few that transited .",
    "the kilodegree extremely little telescope ( kelt ) @xcite is the most extreme of the mature transit surveys , with the largest single - camera field of view ( 26 degrees on a side ) and the largest platescale ( 23/pixel )  similar to the planned tess mission @xcite .",
    "therefore , while kelt is optimized to find fewer planets , it can find those around brighter host stars which allows a greater breadth and ease of follow - up to fully utilize the wealth of information the transiting planets potentially offer : planetary radius , orbital inclination ( and so the true mass ) , stellar density @xcite , composition @xcite , spin - orbit misalignment @xcite , atmosphere @xcite to name a few  see @xcite for a comprehensive review .",
    "we now describe the discovery of kelt-4a , an inflated hot jupiter ( r=@xmath14  @xmath15 ) orbiting the bright component ( v=10 ) of a hierarchical triple . in terms of size , kelt-4a  is qualitatively similar to wasp-79b @xcite and wasp-94ab @xcite , which have slightly larger planets around slightly fainter stars .",
    "its size is also similar to kelt-8b @xcite .",
    "see section 6.2 of @xcite for a more detailed comparison of similar planets .",
    "kelt-4a  is only the third known transiting planet in a hierarchical triple stellar system , along with wasp-12b and hat - p-8b @xcite .",
    "kelt-4 is the brightest host of all these systems , and therefore a valuable find for extensive follow - up of both inflated planets and hierarchical architectures .",
    "because it is relatively nearby ( 210 pc ) , continued ao imaging will be able to provide dynamical constraints on the stellar system .",
    "the procedure we used to identify kelt-4a  is identical to that described in @xcite , using the setup described in @xcite , both of which we summarize briefly here .",
    "kelt-4a  was discovered in field 06 of our survey , which is a @xmath20 x @xmath20 field of view centered at j2000 09:46:24.1 , + 31:39:56 , best observed in february .",
    "we took 150 second exposures with our 42 mm telescope located at winer observatory in sonoita , arizona , with a typical cadence of 15 - 30 minutes as we cycled between observable fields .    each object in the kelt survey is matched to the tycho-2 @xcite and 2mass @xcite catalogs , which we use to derive a reduced proper motion cut to remove giants from our sample @xcite .",
    "after image subtraction , outliers are clipped and the light curves are detrended with the trend filtering algorithm @xcite , and a bls search is performed @xcite . after passing various programmatic cuts described in @xcite , candidates are inspected by eye and selected for follow - up .",

    "while superwasp achieved roughly the same photometric precision with almost as many observations as kelt did , due to the near - integer period of kelt-4a  ( period = @xmath21 ) and the relatively short span of the superwasp observations , superwasp did not observe the ingress of the planet , as shown in figure [ fig : wasp ] .",
    "minutes ) . despite observing the star at roughly the same precision and obtaining nearly as many data points as kelt , the near - integer period of kelt-4a  and relatively short span of observations makes superwasp s phase coverage sparse , which explains why superwasp was not able to identify kelt-4a  in their data.,width=312 ]    while hat and superwasp",
    "adopt a strategy to change fields often , likely because of the shallow dependence of the detectability with the duration of observations @xcite , kelt has generally opted to monitor the same fields for much longer , increasing its sensitivity to longer and near - integer periods , as demonstrated by this find .",
    "we have amassed an extensive follow - up network consisting of around 30 telescopes from amateurs , universities , and professional observatories . coordinating with the kelt team , collaborators obtained 19 high - quality transits in six bands with six different telescopes , shown in figure [ fig : transits ] .",
    "all transits are combined and binned in 5-minute intervals in figure [ fig : bintran ] to demonstrate the statistical power of the combined fit to the entire dataset , as well as the level of systematics present in this combined fit , though this combined light curve was not used directly for analysis .    )",

    "these are labeled `` flwo '' in figure [ fig : transits ] . in the end , only eight of these transits were used in the final fit .",
    "we excluded one transit on the night of ut 2013 - 01 - 15 .",
    "cloudy weather forced the dome to close twice during the first half of the observations .",
    "thin clouds continued throughout egress .",
    "when analyzed , these data produced a @xmath26 significant outlier in the transit time , hinting at large systematics in this lightcurve .",
    "we include it with our electronic tables for completeness , but due to the cloudy weather , we do not include it in our analysis .",
    "we also excluded another transit observed on the night of ut 2012 - 05 - 11 . while there is no obvious fault with the light curve , our mcmc analysis found two widely separated , comparably likely regions of parameter space by exploiting a degeneracy in the baseline flux and the airmass detrending parameter , which significantly degraded the quality of the global analysis .",

    "stellar parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 $ ] , and @xmath38 ) were derived from the fies and tres using the stellar parameter classification ( spc ) tool @xcite , and the hires spectra using specmatch ( petigura et al .",
    "2015 in prep . ) .",
    "it is well known that the transit lightcurve alone can constrain the stellar density @xcite .",
    "coupled with the yy isochrones and a measured @xmath0 , the transit light curve provides a tight constraint on the @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we have discovered that the limb darkening of the transit itself is sufficient to loosely constrain the @xmath0  and therefore the @xmath2  without spectroscopy during a global fit , which we use as another check on the stellar parameters . finally , we iterated on the hires spectroscopic parameters using a prior on the @xmath2  from the global fit .",
    "that is , we used the hires spectroscopic parameters to seed a global fit , found the @xmath2  using the more precise transit constraint , fed that back into specmatch to derive new stellar parameters that are consistent with the transit , and then ran the final global fit .",
    "all of these methods were marginally consistent ( @xmath39 ) with one another , as shown in table [ tab : specpars ] .",
    "since the uncertainties in the measured stellar parameters are typically dominated by the stellar atmospheric models , this marginal consistency is uncommon and may be indicative of a larger than usual systematic error .",
    "it is likely that the discrepancy is due to the blend with the neighbor @xmath40 away .",
    "while the fies @xmath2  agrees best with the @xmath2  derived from the transit photometry , we adopted the hires parameters derived with an iterative @xmath2  prior from the global analysis because of its higher spatial resolution and better median site seeing .",
    "however , to account for the inconsistency between methods , we inflated the uncertainties in @xmath0  and @xmath4 $ ]  as shown in table [ tab : specpars ] so they were in good agreement with the values without the @xmath2  prior and did not include a spectroscopic prior on the @xmath2  during the global fit .",
    "still , systematic errors in the stellar parameters ( and therefore the derived planetary parameters ) at the 1-sigma level would not be surprising .",
    "the slightly hotter star preferred by the other spectroscopic methods would make the star bigger and therefore the planet even more inflated .",

    "* ) , this would place constraints on the orbital parameters of the system as it existed shortly after formation . in particular , for kozai - lidov oscillations to be strong enough to drive the planet from @xmath3595 au to 0.04 au either the initial inclination of the outer orbit relative to the planet must have been close to 90@xmath360 , or the eccentricity of the outer orbit must have been large , or both .",
    "we quantify these constraints by using the ` kozai ` python package @xcite to evolve a set of hierarchical triples in the secular approximation with the observed orbital parameters , but varying the outer eccentricity and the mutual inclination between the planetary orbit and the outer orbit .",
    "although the kelt-4 system contains four bodies , we take the kelt-4bc system to be a point mass of 1.3 @xmath361 . combinations of inclination and outer eccentricity that can drive strong enough kozai - lidov oscillations to bring the planet to within 0.02 au of the star are shown in the unshaded region of figure [ fig : pspace ] . since the distribution of @xmath362 between the planetary orbit and the outer orbit is expected to be uniform and the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries is also observed to be approximately uniform , equal areas of the right panel of figure [ fig : pspace ] can be interpreted as equal probabilities . although we did not include relativistic precession in these calculations , we compared the precession timescale to the period of the kl oscillations and found that the precession timescale was much longer ( at least a factor of 10 ) in all cases in which the kl oscillations are strong enough to drive kelt-4a  to its present location",
    ".        while there are several planets in binary stellar systems , there are only a few transiting planets known in hierarchical triples .",
    "these systems may have had a richer dynamical history than the more commonly found planets in binary systems . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have found that in quadruple systems the presence of the additional body can , in some cases , lead to resonant interactions between the kozai - lidov oscillations that occur in the inner binaries , thereby producing stronger eccentricity oscillations than in hierarchical triples with similar orbital parameters . due to the small mass of kelt-4a",
    "it would not have had any strong dynamical influence on kelt-4bc , but the binarity of kelt-4bc may have influenced the dynamical evolution of kelt-4a .",
    "the discovery of systems like kelt-4 highlights the need for further study of the dynamics of quadruple systems .",
    "high - resolution imaging and rv monitoring of both kelt-4a and kelt-4bc is likely to constrain the orbit of the twins relatively well in a short time .",
    "their inclination and eccentricity is likely to provide insight into the formation and dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "the very long period of kelt-4bc around kelt-4a makes characterizing the orbit of the kelt-4bc binary around the kelt-4a primary more challenging , but continued monitoring may be able to exclude certain inclinations or eccentricities .",
    "we expect , in the three years since the original ao observations , motions of @xmath363 mas between kelt-4b and kelt-4c , which should be easily visible . between kelt-4a and kelt-4bc ,",
    "the motions are expected to be @xmath364 mas , which should also be marginally detectable with additional keck observations .",
    "_ gaia _ @xcite will provide new absolute astrometric measurements on kelt-4a to @xmath365 and an unresolved position of kelt-4bc to @xmath366 . with @xmath366 accuracy ,",
    "_ gaia _ could see significant motion of kelt-4bc in @xmath367 days .",
    "_ gaia _ will also provide a precise distance which will allow us to infer the radius of the primary , thereby distinguishing between the marginally inconsistent stellar parameters .",
    "the maximum rv semi - amplitude of kelt-4a induced by the kelt - bc system , ( i.e. , assuming an edge - on orbit ) , would be @xmath368 or @xmath369 .",
    "since a separate zero point is fit for each data set , we are not sensitive to secular drifts that span the entire data set .",
    "we allowed the slope to be free during the fit , but the uncertainty is a factor of 20 larger than the expected signal .",
    "still , it is not unrealistic to expect to detect a drift with long - term monitoring .",
    "the kelt-4bc system would have a maximum semi - amplitude of @xmath370 or about @xmath371 , which is easily detectable , though its @xmath372 magnitude and 1.5 \" separation from the primary star make it a challenging target .",
    "this inflated hot jupiter , while not unique ( e.g. , hat - p-39b , hat - p-40b , hat - p-41b @xcite ) , like all kelt planets , is among the brightest and therefore easiest to follow up as a result of our survey design ( see figure [ fig : rprsv ] ) .",
    "in particular , high - resolution imaging capable of resolving the stellar binary ( 42 mas ) would help constrain the orbit of kelt-4bc , and may help create a more robust migration history of the entire system .",
    "we thank geoff marcy for use of his keck / hires time and doing observations .",
    "we extend special thanks to those of hawaiian ancestry on whose sacred mountain of mauna kea we are privileged to be guests . without their generous hospitality , the keck observations presented herein would not have been possible",
