    "in the standard model , the sum of the qcd topological angle and the common quark mass phase , @xmath4 , is experimentally bounded to lie below @xmath5(10@xmath6 ) from the non - observation of the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xcite .",
    "while @xmath7 would completely change the physics of nuclei , its effects rapidly decouple for smaller values , already becoming irrelevant for @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , its extremely small value does not seem to be necessary to explain any known large - distance physics .",
    "this , together with the fact that other phases in the yukawa matrices are @xmath9 and that @xmath10 can receive non - decoupling contributions from cp - violating new physics at arbitrarily high scales , begs for a dynamical explanation of its tiny value .    among the known solutions ,",
    "the qcd axion @xcite is probably the most simple and robust : the sm is augmented with an extra pseudo - goldstone boson , whose only non - derivative coupling is to the qcd topological charge and suppressed by the scale @xmath11 .",
    "such a coupling allows the effects of @xmath10 to be redefined away via a shift of the axion field , whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is then guaranteed to vanish  @xcite .",
    "it also produces a mass for the axion @xmath12 .",
    "extra model dependent derivative couplings may be present but they do not affect the solution of the strong - cp problem .",
    "both the mass and the couplings of the qcd axion are thus controlled by a single scale @xmath11",
    ".    presently astrophysical constraints bound @xmath11 between few  10@xmath13  gev ( see for e.g. @xcite ) and few  @xmath14  gev @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that in most of the available parameter space the axion may explain the observed dark matter of the universe . indeed ,",
    "non - thermal production from the misalignment mechanism can easily generate a suitable abundance of cold axions for values of @xmath11 large enough , compatible with those allowed by current bounds .",
    "such a feature is quite model independent and , if confirmed , may give non - trivial constraints on early cosmology .",
    "finally axion - like particles seem to be a generic feature of string compactification . the simplicity and robustness of the axion solution to the strong - cp problem , the fact that it could easily explain the dark matter abundance of our universe and the way it naturally fits within string theory make it one of the best motivated particle beyond the standard model .    because of the extremely small couplings allowed by astrophysical bounds , the quest to discover the qcd axion is a very challenging endeavor . the admx experiment @xcite is expected to become sensitive to a new region of parameter space unconstrained by indirect searches soon .",
    "other experiments are also being planned and several new ideas have recently been proposed to directly probe the qcd axion @xcite . to enhance the tiny signal some of these experiments , including admx , exploit resonance effects and the fact that , if the axion is dark matter , the line width of the resonance is suppressed by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the virial velocity in our galaxy ) @xcite .",
    "should the axion be discovered by such experiments , its mass would be known with a comparably high precision , @xmath17 .",
    "depending on the experiment different axion couplings may also be extracted with a different accuracy .",
    "can we exploit such high precision in the axion mass and maybe couplings ?",
    "what can we learn from such measurements ?",
    "will we be able to infer the uv completion of the axion ? and",
    "its cosmology ?    in this paper",
    "we try to make a small step towards answering some of these questions .",
    "naively , high precision in qcd axion physics seems hopeless .",
    "after all most of its properties , such as its mass , couplings to matter and relic abundance are dominated by non perturbative qcd dynamics . on the contrary , we will show that high precision is within reach .",
    "given its extremely light mass , qcd chiral lagrangians @xcite can be used reliably . performing a nlo computation we are able to extract the axion mass , self coupling and its full potential at the percent level .",
    "the coupling to photons can be extracted with similar precision , as well as the tension of domain walls . as a spin - off we provide estimates of the topological susceptibility and the quartic moment with similar precision and new estimates of some low energy constants .",
    "we also describe a new strategy to extract the couplings to nucleons directly from first principle qcd . at the moment",
    "the precision is not yet at the percent level , but there is room for improvement as more lattice qcd results become available .",
    "the computation of the axion potential can easily be extended to finite temperature .",
    "in particular , at temperatures below the crossover ( @xmath18170  mev ) chiral lagrangians allow the temperature dependence of the axion potential and its mass to be computed . around @xmath19",
    "there is no known reliable perturbative expansion under control and non - perturbative methods , such as lattice qcd @xcite , are required .    at higher temperatures ,",
    "when qcd turns perturbative , one may be tempted to use the dilute instanton gas approximation , which is expected to hold at large enough temperatures .",
    "we point out however that the bad convergence of the perturbative qcd expansion at finite temperatures makes the standard instanton result completely unreliable for temperatures below @xmath20 , explaining the large discrepancy observed in recent lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a study of the impact of such uncertainty in the computation of the axion relic abundance , providing updated plots for the allowed axion parameter space .    for convenience we report the main numerical results of the paper here , for the mass @xmath21 the coupling to photons @xmath22 \\,,\\ ] ] the couplings to nucleons ( for the hadronic ksvz model for definiteness ) @xmath23 and for the self quartic coupling and the tension of the domain wall respectively",

    "first the axion coupling to the axial current only renormalizes multiplicatively unlike the coupling to the gluon operator , which mixes with the axial current divergence at one - loop .",
    "second the only non - derivative couplings of the axion appear through the quark mass terms .    at leading order in @xmath27",
    "the axion can be treated as an external source , the effects from virtual axions being further suppressed by the tiny coupling .",
    "the non derivative couplings to qcd are encoded in the phase dependence of the dressed quark mass matrix @xmath38 , while in the derivative couplings the axion enters as an external axial current .",
    "the low energy behaviour of correlators involving such external sources is completely captured by chiral lagrangians , whose _",
    "raison dtre _ is exactly to provide a consistent perturbative expansion for such quantities .",
    "notice that the choice of field redefinition ( [ eq : redq ] ) allowed us to move the non - derivative couplings entirely into the lightest two quarks . in this way we can integrate out all the other quarks and directly work in the 2-flavor effective theory , with @xmath38 capturing the whole axion dependence , at least for observables that do not depend on the derivative couplings .    at the leading order in the chiral expansion all the non - derivative dependence on the axion",
    "is thus contained in the pion mass terms : @xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 is the trace over flavor indices , @xmath42 is related to the chiral condensate and determined by the pion mass in term of the quark masses , and the pion decay constant is normalized such that @xmath43  mev .    in order to derive the leading order effective axion potential we need only consider the neutral pion sector .",

    "although the expression for the potential ( [ eq : pota ] ) was derived long ago @xcite , we would like to stress some points often under - emphasized in the literature .",

    "indeed the shape of the potential is @xmath9 different from that of a single cosine , and its dependence on the quark masses is non - analytic , as a consequence of the presence of light goldstone modes .",
    "the axion self coupling , which is extracted from the fourth derivative of the potential @xmath53 is roughly a factor of 3 smaller than @xmath54 , the one extracted from the single cosine potential @xmath52 .",
    "the six - axion couplings differ in sign as well .",
    "the vev for the neutral pion , @xmath55 can be shifted away by a non - singlet chiral rotation .",

    "results with the 3-flavor chiral lagrangian are often found in the literature . in the 2-flavor lagrangian the extra contributions from the strange quark",
    "are contained inside the low - energy couplings . within the 2-flavor effective theory",

    "the natural question is , how good are the estimates obtained so far using leading order chiral lagrangians ? in the 3-flavor chiral lagrangian",
    "nlo corrections are typically around 20 - 30% .",
    "the 2-flavor theory enjoys a much better perturbative expansion given the larger hierarchy between pions and the other mass thresholds . to get a quantitative answer",
    "the only option is to perform a complete nlo computation . given the better behaviour of the 2-flavor expansion we perform all our computation with the strange quark integrated out .",
    "the price we pay is the reduced number of physical observables that can be used to extract the higher order couplings .",
    "when needed we will use the 3-flavor theory to extract the values of the 2-flavor ones .",
    "this will produce intrinsic uncertainties @xmath75 in the extraction of the 2-flavor couplings .",
    "such uncertainties however will only have a small impact on the final result whose dependence on the higher order 2-flavor couplings is suppressed by the light quark masses .",
    "the first quantity we compute is the axion mass .",

    "a partial computation of the axion mass at one loop was first attempted in @xcite .",
    "more recently the full nlo corrections to @xmath78 has been computed in @xcite .",
    "we recomputed this quantity independently and present the result for the axion mass directly in terms of observable renormalized quantities .",

    "@xmath87 are separately scale invariant .",
    "similar properties are also present in the 3-flavor computation , in particular there are no @xmath88 corrections ( after renormalization of the tree - level result ) , as noticed already in @xcite .    to get a numerical estimate of the axion mass and the size of the corrections we need the values of the nlo couplings . in principle",
    "@xmath83 could be extracted from the qcd contribution to the @xmath89-@xmath47 mass splitting .",
    "while lattice simulations have started to become sensitive to em and isospin breaking effects , at the moment there are no reliable estimates of this quantity from first principle qcd .",
    "even less is known about @xmath90 , which does not enter other measured observables .",
    "the only hope would be to use lattice qcd computation to extract such coupling by studying the quark mass dependence of observables such as the topological susceptibility .",
    "since these studies are not yet available we employ a small trick : we use the relations in @xcite between the 2- and 3-flavor couplings to circumvent the problem .",
    "in particular we have @xmath91 the first term in @xmath83 is due to the tree - level contribution to the @xmath89-@xmath47 mass splitting due to the @xmath47-@xmath92 mixing from isospin breaking effects .",
    "the rest of the contribution , formally nlo , includes the effect of the @xmath92-@xmath93 mixing and numerically is as important as the tree - level piece @xcite .",
    "we thus only need the values of the 3-flavor couplings @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which can be extracted from chiral fits @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite , we refer to appendix  [ sec : app1 ] for more details on the values used .",
    "an important point is that by using 3-flavor couplings the precision of the estimates of the 2-flavor ones will be limited to the convergence of the 3-flavor lagrangian .",
    "however , given the small size of such corrections even an @xmath9 uncertainty will still translate into a small overall error .",
    "the final numerical ingredient needed is the actual up and down quark masses , in particular their ratio .",
    "since this quantity already appears in the tree level formula of the axion mass we need a precise estimate for it , however , because of the kaplan - manohar ( km ) ambiguity @xcite , it can not be extracted within the meson lagrangian .",
    "fortunately recent lattice qcd simulations have dramatically improved our knowledge of this quantity .",
    "considering the latest results we take @xmath96 where we have conservatively taken a larger error than the one coming from simply averaging the results in @xcite ( see the appendix  [ sec : app1 ] for more details ) .",
