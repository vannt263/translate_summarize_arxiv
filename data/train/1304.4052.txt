    "the 50.2 millisecond pulsar , including the surrounding supernova remnant , in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , is often referred to as the `` crab twin '' . its assumed age of about 1000 years , its pulse period , and its surrounding pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , are all similar to the crab .",
    "the most obvious differences between the two pulsars and their surrounding nebulae are that the supernova ejecta of are oxygen - rich , and that the remnant has a shell of fast ejecta that interacts with interstellar or circumstellar gas .",
    "the latter is not yet confirmed for the crab ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "a detailed comparison between the pwne of the two pulsars is more difficult due to the large distance of ( about 51kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , compared to the crab ( @xmath5kpc ; see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; the semi - major axis of the torus in the crab only subtends about 15 at the distance of . because of this there is still no counterpart for and its pwn to the detailed synchronised visual and x - ray study of the crab pwn by @xcite .",
    "the latter authors reveal the presence of outward moving equatorial wisps at half the lightspeed .",
    "many time - variable sub - arcsecond structures exist in the crab pwn in the visual wavelength range @xcite , the near - infrared wavelength range @xcite , and in the x - ray regime @xcite ; this is all discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite are the first to report evidence for changes in the structure of over a relatively short time period .",
    "they find a ten - year flux variation ( 19952005 ) in the southwest direction where the pwn emits the strongest , and suggest that they have detected a hot spot that moves at a speed of about four per cent of the lightspeed .",
    "they also note that the hot spot could be similar to a time - varying arc - like feature in the outer crab nebula , and that a pulsar jet in could be directed towards the bright southwest region rather than perpendicular to this direction , as is earlier suggested by @xcite .",
    "more recently present a study of the pwn of ; we use the same data as @xcite , but complement it with all available hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) data . in particular , we include _ hst _ polarisation data from 2007 , as well as all available x - ray data .",
    "these data confirm a remarkable activity in the southwest region of the pwn , with the apparent `` blob '' 13 southwest of the pulsar , which emerges in 1999 and then fades until 20052007 .",
    "we suggest that the `` blob '' structure may be a part of now fading filamentary structure that was excited in 1999 , rather than a moving entity .",
    "particularly evident is how well the continuum emission traces the emission structure in [ ] , and how low the correlation is between emission in the continuum and [ ] .",
    "a high intensity ratio @xmath6}}/i_{\\text{[\\ion{o}{iii}]}}$ ] can mean either shock activity @xcite , or a locally high s / o - ratio .",
    "the former scenario could , e.g. , be an outflow in the pwn from the pulsar , which temporally excites filaments at the `` blob '' . discard time - dependent photoionization by emission from the x - ray blob as the source of the enhanced @xmath6}}/i_{\\text{[\\ion{o}{iii}]}}$ ] , and instead argue for slower shocks that are transmitted into pwn - embedded filaments ; in a way similar to the shocks that are transmitted into the blobs of the circumstellar ring around sn1987a ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "it is evident that a spatially resolved spectroscopic study in the visual wavelength range , which completely covers the central parts of in several emission lines , would provide new information .",

    "vimos data are provided in files of four separate detectors per field , where each detector holds 400 full spectra .",
    "the files of each detector are reduced separately , and are combined after flux calibration , to create an image containing the full field of all 1600 spectra .",
    "here follows a description of the method .    at first",
    "the five provided bias images of each night are combined to create a master - bias image , which is subtracted from all other images of the same night . in a second step ,",
    "a trace mask is created using a continuum lamp image . since vimos spectra overlap significantly on the ccd ,",
    "cross - dispersion line profiles are calculated in this step , to allow a consecutive spectrum deconvolution .",
    "cross - dispersion line profiles are calculated every 20th pixel on the dispersion axis to allow an accurate extraction , they are interpolated for the remaining pixels . in a third step a dispersion mask for the wavelength calibration",
    "is created using an arc image .",
    "there are few and mostly no visible arc lines blue - wards of the helium line at 5852 in data of the hr - orange grism .",
    "this is no problem , however , since we are only interested in [ ] @xmath1 .",
    "the residual @xmath17 between the fitted wavelength , which is calculated using a fifth order polynomial , and the known wavelengths of the arc lines , is always in the range @xmath18 .",
    "cosmic - ray hits are removed , before spectra are extracted , in the science images using the pycosmic algorithm @xcite ; in the version that is integrated into , using default parameters .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show that accurate spectrum centre positions are crucial when extracting spectra accurately , even an offset of 0.1 pixels affects results significantly .",
    "with vimos calculated profiles have to be offset due to instrument flexure between the times of the continuum lamp exposure and the science exposure .",
    "new centre positions are calculated ( for working fibres ) in the science image , which is first median - filtered on the dispersion axis .",
    "one median value of the difference between all old and new centre positions is calculated and added to the profile positions . in a fourth step spectra are extracted using the multi - profile deconvolution method ( @xcite , which is the -version of the algorithm of @xcite ) .",
    "data of all four quadrants of either grism are setup to use the same wavelength array .",
    "this choice allows a straightforward combination of reduced and flux - calibrated images into one spectrum image .",
    "the dispersion mask was then applied in a fifth step . in a sixth step a correction to the fibre - to - fibre sensitivity variations was applied to the extracted and wavelength - calibrated science spectra by dividing with the mean spectrum of an extracted and normalised continuum lamp flat - field image , excluding all spectra of broken and low - transmission fibres .",
    "ccd fringing effects are removed rather well in this step as the flat - field spectra are neither smoothed nor replaced with a polynomial , which is the usual procedure with for other instruments . during extraction data are changed from a ccd - based format to a row - stacked - spectra ( rss ) format .    in a seventh step ,",
    "extracted spectra are flux calibrated using the reduced standard - star exposure of the respective night and grism . in an eighth step flux calibrated images of the four separate detectors are combined to create one rss image with 1600 spectra . for unknown reasons , as well as insufficient information to do calibration even more accurately , measured fluxes vary with both the detector and with spatial elements ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "all spectra are therefore normalised to achieve the same integrated median flux in a telluric line .",
    "we used the telluric line near @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) with data of hr - blue ( hr - orange ) . in step nine",
    ", the detector - combined images are corrected for differential atmospheric refraction ( dar ) as is described in @xcite .",
    "finally , in step ten extracted rss images are converted to data cubes , where the first two dimensions contain spatial information  east is to the left and north is up  and the third dimension contains the spectrum information .",
    "to extract velocity structures of gases emitting in spectral lines that are available in our data , we focus on [ ] @xmath21 and [ ] @xmath22 .",
    "these two multiplets produce different structures in _ hst _ imaging observations ( ) . in particular , we find a spatial anti - correlation between [ ] and [ ] at the position of a `` blob '' about 13 southwest of the pulsar , with [ ] tracing the optical continuum emission , as well as the surface intensity of x - rays .",
    "potential problems with imaging observations are contamination by point sources  including stars and the pulsar  and the lmc background , also the red wings of [ ] @xmath23 may blend with the blue wing of [ ] @xmath24 , and only a fraction of the combined multiplet flux enters a spectral filter .",
    "the difference in wavelength between the two sulphur ( oxygen ) lines corresponds to @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the total line width of [ ] is at least @xmath27 ( ) , which means that both lines have blended line components .    with our spectroscopic vimos data we are able to bypass several of these problems .",
    "at first , we note that out of 1600 spectra in one science exposure about 200 passed through broken fibres , are vignetted , or are otherwise affected by such broken and vignetted spectra during the dar correction .",
    "hence , in our analysis we used the ( approximately ) 1400 remaining spectra .",
    "moreover , for each individual useful spectrum we analysed the full [ ] and [ ] multiplets .",
    "we made linear fits to the continuum levels within the spectral domains of each multiplet , and then subtracted these continua from the respective spectra .",
    "we did not deredden the spectra .    in the following",
    "we first discuss the [ ] and the [ ] spectra in sections 4.1 and 4.2 .",
    "thereafter , we study intensity and density maps in section 4.3 , and velocity maps in sections 4.4 and 4.5 .      for [ ] we decomposed the two line components , using the knowledge that the transition probability ratio @xmath28}\\,\\lambda5007)/a([\\text{\\ion{o}{iii}]}\\,\\lambda4959)\\!=\\!3 $ ] . to remove the lmc background , we fitted the spectrally unresolved gaussian line profiles in areas near the four corners of the field ( avoiding spectra of the low - transmission fibres in the second quadrant ) .",
    "thereafter , we created a two - dimensional fit to subtract that lmc component from all spectra .",
    "simultaneously we transferred the spectrum to the velocity of the lmc [ ] emission in the field , which we found to be @xmath29 .",
    "the average spectrum of all 1400 fibres in the entire field for [ ] @xmath14 is shown with a magenta - coloured line in the lower panel of fig .",

    "the full line profile fills the velocity range , i.e. , we recover the total width that is observed by ; we note that our spectral resolution is about eight times as high as theirs ( 250 ) ; their line profile could therefore be slightly broader for the same area probed .",
    "( @xcite discuss the importance of sufficient spectral resolution to constrain the faint parts of line profiles in the crab snr . )",
    "apart from that , we can not obtain a perfect match between our data and those of , despite their wide ( 20 ) slit and fairly poor ( 15 ) seeing , which should include much of the pwn in the detected emission .",
    "the most obvious features are , however , identical , i.e. , the generally redshifted emission with a broad shoulder in the blue .",

    "the blue shoulder at velocities @xmath42-@xmath43 is very similar to that of the spectrum of the entire field .",

    "if we focus on the larger features of the remnant , we could be close to the real structure . as another example , filaments in the crab expand nearly linearly , and a linear expansion assumption is correct to within about 10% @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty in a transformation from radial velocity to a physical scale for is probably the uncertainty of the remnant age .        with our derived properties of the diagonal structures in section 4.5 and the above assumptions about the transformation to physical scales , the diagonals correspond to an angle of about 65 relative to the line of sight .",
    "we therefore expect an overall structure to extend northeast from about zero velocity , and into the plane of the sky at an angle of 65 relative to the line of sight .",

    "[ fig : mayavi ] we view the possibly bipolar structure closer to its axis as viewed in the plane of the sky with the @xmath76-axis oriented inwards from east to west ; different parts overlap more , and it is more difficult to disentangle individual features .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mayavi2 ] we note abundant high - velocity gas in [ ] that fills the boxes in all panels ; in particular on the near side of the box , as seen from the earth ( blue colour coding ) .",

    "[ fig : blobspec ] .",
    "the large structure that we identified in the previous subsection and in figs .  [ fig : cubes ] and  [ fig : mayavi ] has a position angle relative to the sky of pa@xmath104 .",
    "there is certainly some uncertainty to this position angle that might be high enough to accommodate the symmetry axis that is discussed in . in this previous study",
    "we find that many parameters change along this symmetry axis , and we argue for present and possible past shock activity along it ; the symmetry - axis position angle is pa=4550 .",
    "the `` blob '' region stands out in figs .",
    "[ fig : cubes ] and  [ fig : mayavi ] .",
    "an explanation to its existence could be a shock that propagates at @xmath105 along the line of sight . for normal cosmic abundances ,",
    "the main problem with this interpretation is that cooling and recombination times are long for densities that are typical of this object .",
    "the post - shock temperature would be about @xmath106k , and cooling times would be comparable to the age of the remnant for a post - shock electron density of @xmath107 . the situation is , however , different for that has a high metal abundance .",
    "we have used our plasma code that is discussed in @xcite and @xcite to estimate cooling times for a range of abundances . in particular , with the relative abundances suggested by @xcite for the oxygen - rich filaments ",
    "i.e. , o : ne : mg : si : s : ar : ca : fe = 1 : 0.2 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.1 by number  the cooling time scale is less than a few years for a post - shock electron density of @xmath108 and temperatures corresponding to the shock velocities we tested , i.e. , between 50500 .",
    "we can even allow h and he to dominate , with h : he : o = 10 : 2 : 1  with all other metal abundances as in the oxygen - rich case  and still have a cooling time scale of less than 10 years for a post - shock electron density of @xmath108 .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that a radiative shock that propagates at @xmath105 along the line of sight could exist at the `` blob '' position , but we can not rule out slower shocks than this ; if they are driven into already expanding structures , such as the ring - like features that are mainly seen in [ ] .",
    "observations that sample [ ] emission at high spatial resolution would provide useful data to constrain the shock velocity .",
    "unfortunately , vimos / ifu does not contain [ ] @xmath4 ; previous observations show that these lines are strong in the central region of ( @xcite ; ) .    to explain shocks that propagate at velocities of up to 400 along the line of sight , we need to use similar arguments as ; i.e. , some event occurred at the `` blob '' position , which caused shocks to be driven into filaments there .",
    "the high @xmath6}}/i_{\\text{[\\ion{o}{iii}]}}$ ] ratio is not due to high local sulphur overabundance , if [ ] is concentrated to this location .",

    "we discuss a possible common origin to the structure we find here and the structures of .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , we assumed that the ring - like structures  that are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mayavi ]  expand linearly .",
    "the position of the pulsar is @xmath109 , which corresponds to the position projected on the sky @xcite .",
    "we are tempted to suggest that the pulsar is positioned close to an axis that is put between the centres of the two ring - like features .",
    "this places the pulsar at a velocity along the line of sight of @xmath110 .",
    "a 3@xmath111 upper limit on the proper motion on the sky is @xmath112 @xcite , which implies that the true pulsar motion is 400@xmath86 , directed away from us at an angle that is within @xmath113 of the line of sight .",
    "an argument against the pulsar sitting on the far ( red ) side of the nebula is the structure of faint [ ] emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mayavi2 ] ) , which appears fairly centred on the pulsar at the lmc rest velocity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mayavi ] [ ] appears to fill the structure more along the axis between the ring - like features than [ ] .",

    "@xcite discuss processes that create and pull filaments into the pwn , but it is unclear how efficient such a filamentation is , and how late in the pwn evolution filaments could develop to remain unsuppressed . if it is the pulsar activity that varies , filaments may not have to move towards the axis . in this case activities in the pwn along",

    "this is reminiscent of the situation in the pwn of . in",
    "we find that the region close to the `` blob '' , @xmath117@xmath118 southwest of the pulsar , shows the hardest x - ray spectrum with a photon index of about 1.65 . in the crab , this region is on the far side of the torus , and is therefore not doppler boosted .",
    "if we identify the `` blob '' region in the pwn of in the same way  that is , as an active region in the pwn torus  we can speculate that the pwn torus in could be doppler boosted on the south - western side .",
    "the x - ray emission is namely brighter on that side compared to the north - eastern side .",
    "x - ray emission could also be enhanced due to interaction with supernova ejecta .",
    "if we identify the symmetry axis in the pwn of as a torus , we note that the difference between it and the crab is that the optical line emission follows the x - ray emission closely in .",
    "there is no such strong correlation in the crab ( see , for example , fig .  11 in",
    "this observation , and the in general higher temperatures that are derived from [ ] in the pwn of compared to the crab , favour a scenario where optical emission to a larger extent is driven by shocks rather than by photoionization in the pwn of .",
    "the true ejecta distribution in the latter object may therefore not be correctly described by the structure as visualised in figs .",
    "[ fig : mayavi ] and  [ fig : mayavi2 ] , since regions that are not excited by shocks will be fainter .",
    "the wide wavelength - range observational study of @xcite of the entire region of the crab can provide a clue to the overall structure also for the pwn of .",
    "their three - dimensional movie shows bright loops that are visible preferentially in the torus plane , whereas structures in the jet directions are less structured and fainter .",
    "if the distance between the torus and the loops were shorter , a situation may arise such as that in the pwn of .",
    "the discussion in @xcite that oxygen - rich ejecta in may have high - density structures that lag behind the general pwn / ejecta interface fits such a scenario .      if the ejecta structures we observe in [ ] and [ ] correspond to the real matter distribution  and not just an effect of excitation by , for example , a pwn torus  this could lead to clues about the supernova explosion .",
    "a parallel case with apparent asymmetric ejecta structures is sn  1987a , where observed inner ejecta lie in a plane that is close to the equatorial plane of the circumstellar ring @xcite . here",
    "structures of the metal - rich ejecta can be probed out to about 3500 , as a consequence of still active radioactive decay and ongoing interaction with the circumstellar ring .",
    "this higher velocity limit is twice as high as what we achieve with our vimos data for .",
    "a direct comparison with sn  1987a is therefore not straightforward .",
    "another young well - observed core - collapse supernova remnant is cas  a @xcite .",
    "a comparison with is also in this case complicated , as the progenitor of cas  a was a type iib sn @xcite with an ejecta mass of perhaps as low as @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the ejecta of are more massive , probably more similar to the ejecta mass of sn  1987a ( ) . due to the low ejecta mass , in combination with pre - supernova mass loss ,",
    "the observed ejecta structures in cas  a are affected by the reverse shock ; the reverse shock has now reached freely expanding ejecta at about 5000 @xcite .",
    "a massive asymmetric circumstellar shell is needed if a reverse shock were to be observationally important also in .",
    "if we envision a circumstellar disk , as in sn  1987a , this may still leave an imprint if it was massive enough . a scenario with a circumstellar ring in",
    "is discussed by @xcite , but it is not clear why it would be oxygen - rich , which is needed to explain the line emission in ( see , for example , fig .  6 in ) .    the most advanced three - dimensional supernova simulation that is available for the full evolution from explosion until shock breakout is that of @xcite .",

    "for there is also the interaction between ejecta and the pwn , which alters the original structure .",
    "nevertheless , we can probably draw some general conclusions on the three - dimensional structure of elemental abundances .",
    "the simulations clearly show how high - z elements such as nickel ( @xmath121ni )  as well as other iron - group elements and silicon  are mixed far out into the envelope , and are actually more mixed than oxygen , neon , and magnesium , on average . looking in more detail , there are , however , large differences in the three - dimensional distribution of the elements .",
    "most spectacular is the high - z element distribution , with rather few long fingers protruding into the h / he envelope .",
    "this naturally explains the necessity of artificial mixing to large velocities of @xmath121ni in models of sn  1987a to explain its light curve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
