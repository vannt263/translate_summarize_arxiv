    "the discovery of quantum oscillations in layered high - temperature superconductors  @xcite has brought renewed attention to the normal phase below the superconducting dome .",
    "the challenge posed is to understand how these systems evolve as a function of carrier concentration in the absence of the superconducting phase  @xcite . at large doping , the copper - oxide layers are metallic . on the other hand , at zero doping these systems are mott insulators  @xcite , i.e. systems that are insulating due to the strong screened coulomb interactions between the electrons .",
    "thus , as a function of the carrier concentration , a mott metal - insulator transition ( mit ) occurs , i.e. a transition driven by the on - site coulomb repulsion between the electrons  @xcite . we are challenged to understand the mott transition driven by carrier concentration in the normal phase  @xcite .    at the theoretical level , to address this physics we need to study the competition between the kinetic band effects , that delocalize the electrons in the lattice , and the effects due to screened interactions that localize them .",
    "these two ingredients are present in the hubbard model , which contains a kinetic energy term that describes the band structure , plus an interaction term that represents the screened local coulomb repulsion between electrons occupying the same site of the lattice .",
    "more than fifty years of intense research shows that this simple model has a surprisingly rich set of solutions that may help capture the complex behavior observed in nature with minimal assumptions .",
    "even the simple - looking hubbard model poses a formidable challenge to theory .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) has played a central role in advancing our knowledge of the physics contained in the hubbard model and has proven to be a useful method to investigate the mott metal insulator transition .",
    "in essence , dynamical - mean - field theory embeds a single site  @xcite or a cluster  @xcite in an infinite self - consistent bath of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the latter problem is then amenable to accurate numerical solutions .",
    "this approach can also be justified from a variational perspective  @xcite .",
    "dmft with a single site immersed in a bath is exact in infinite dimension  @xcite and provides a quite accurate mean field description of materials  @xcite and of the mott transition  @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "the picture is that the mott insulator can be driven towards a correlated metallic state through a first - order transition by tuning correlation strength , or temperature , or doping  @xcite . here",
    "the fundamental unifying concept is the first - order transition .",
    "that transition dominates the entire normal phase diagram of the model , and is relevant at finite temperature even if the actual mott transition is hidden by the onset of some long - range order .",
    "something similar occurs in the fermi liquid description of the normal state of weakly correlated materials .",
    "there , the zero - temperature fermi liquid fixed point can be masked by a long - range ordered state that is the true ground state .",
    "nevertheless , as long as one is not too close to the transition to long - range order , the normal state is well described by the finite temperature fermi liquid that emerges from the zero - temperature fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "while the fermi liquid provides a mean - field description of a phase where the self - energy is analytical @xmath3 ) , dmft also allows a phase , such as the mott insulator , where the self - energy is not an analytical function of frequency  @xcite .    for strongly - interacting layered materials , such as the above - mentioned cuprate high temperature superconductors , or for the layered organic conductors ,",
    "the description provided by the single - site dmft solution of strongly correlated electron models is valid only at very large doping or at temperatures that are in fact much too large to be interesting .",
    "this is because single - site dmft neglects spatial fluctuations , and for these systems the short - range correlations play an important role due to their low dimensionality .",
    "for example , the observed pressure - driven first - order mott transition in organic superconductors of the bedt family  @xcite has the wrong slope in the pressure - temperature plane when compared with the single - site dmft solution .",
    "this is corrected  @xcite by cluster extensions of dmft  @xcite that incorporate short - range magnetic correlations in the theoretical description . similarly ,",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations on the square lattice at half - filling show that a mott gap opens up at finite temperature independently of antiferromagnetism starting around  @xcite @xmath4 , with @xmath0 the interaction strength and @xmath5 nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "it is only with extensions of dmft on a plaquette that this result is recovered  @xcite .",
    "we stress that as larger and larger cluster sizes are considered  @xcite , the description of the normal state will become more and more accurate at lower temperature , but it will also fail when long - range order sets in . hence , we argue that calculations , such as ours , that are based on a plaquette and reproduce the @xmath4 result mentioned above are an accurate mean - field description of the normal sate . hence , this is the type of approach that we adopt in the present paper .",
    "cluster extensions of dmft are however computationally more expensive than their single - site counterpart .",
    "nevertheless , useful physical insights on the phase diagram of the hubbard model have been obtained within that framework and have helped elucidate some important properties of the copper oxide superconductors . among the main results , we mention pseudogap formation at low doping  @xcite , the presence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity  @xcite , and the momentum dependence of the electronic properties along the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "we caution that cluster extensions of dmft come in two varieties : the dynamical cluster approximation  @xcite ( dca ) and cellular dmft  @xcite . for simplicity we did not distinguish between both approaches in the previous discussions .",
    "they generally give qualitatively similar results . here",
    "we shall employ cellular dmft .",
    "returning to the normal state , the overall picture for the mott transition in cluster extensions of dmft have been lacking because cluster methods , as already mentioned , are computationally expensive .",
    "however , a few years ago there was a breakthrough .",
    "the continuous - time quantum monte carlo technique in the hybridization expansion  @xcite now provides us with the possibility to explore the full phase diagram of the model within the cluster dmft method .",
    "this is because this algorithm considerably reduces the computational time , allowing both unprecedented accuracy and studies over a wider range of parameters .",
    "recent investigations using this method and other continuous - time quantum monte carlo techniques  @xcite , have determined the interaction driven mott mit , revealing sharp modifications to the single - site picture  @xcite . the transition driven by carrier concentration , more relevant for the high - temperature superconductors , is also currently under intense investigation  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the physics of the cuprates , almost all the studies focus on the large interaction regime where the mott gap is well developed and they consider the effects of different band structure parameters in order to capture the striking particle - hole asymmetry observed in those compounds .",
    "this direction of research produced several important results , however a unified scenario for the mott transition realized in cluster extensions of dmft for the hubbard model was still missing .    in our recent work  @xcite and in the present study",
    ", we take a different approach to address this problem . instead of focusing on a region of the parameter space where the interaction strength is large , we map out the _ whole _ normal state phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model as a function of interaction , temperature and doping . to capture the general features of the localization - delocalization mott physics , we simply consider nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "our strategy is motivated by one of the key lessons of the single - site dmft solution of the hubbard model : a first - order transition governs the entire phase diagram of the model .",
    "we ask whether the mott transition still dominates the phase diagram and how it is modified by the short - range correlations taken into account through cellular dmft .",
    "as mentioned above , in the hubbard model the mott transition can be tuned by temperature , by the interaction strength ( interaction driven mit , relevant for the layered organics ) and by the carrier concentration ( doping driven mit , relevant for the cuprates ) .",
    "fundamentally , one is exploring the same strong coupling physics from different perspectives . at half - filling ,",
    "the cluster dmft solutions of the model _ do _ display a first - order transition , as a function of the interaction strength , between a correlated metallic state and a mott insulator  @xcite .",
    "what is the fate of this first - order transition as a function of the carrier concentration ?",
    "as reported in our recent work  @xcite and in great detail here , the full mapping of the normal - state phase diagram reveals that upon increasing the carrier concentration towards the mott insulator , there is indeed a surface of first - order transition .",
    "this is distinct from the surface of first - order transition found at fixed @xmath0 as a function of second - neighbor hopping in earlier work  @xcite .",
    "thus , as in the single - site case , in cellular dmft the finite temperature mott transition provides the key to understand the whole phase diagram .",
    "in addition , contrary both to single - site dmft and to conventional wisdom , the first - order transition , emerging at the half - filled mott critical endpoint , progressively moves to large doping as the interaction strength increases .",
    "hence the transition can occur between two metallic states , one of which evolves continuously from the mott insulator , a surprising effect brought about by the short - range correlations .",
    "the first - order transition and the associated critical line that we find are not only new , they also provide a unified picture for a host of previously known results .",
    "for example , the first - order transition was not detected at large values of the interaction by previous works most likely because the critical line moves rapidly to lower temperature with increasing interaction strength , falling below the temperatures accessible to date . hence , previously reported features of the phase diagram of the hubbard model  @xcite , whether it is thermodynamic properties , scattering rate , momentum differentiation or other , appear in a different light . as we shall see",
    ", our analysis allows one to identify these features as precursors of the first - order transition , hence calling for their re - evaluation .",
    "it is in this decisive sense that our work goes beyond -and is compatible with- previous studies .",
    "compared to our recent letter  @xcite , the present work extends and provides further results on the thermodynamics , on the spin susceptibility , on results for other values of the parameters and many additional details and a refined interpretation .",
    "in section  [ sec : methodology ] we briefly discuss the model and method .",
    "the peculiar normal - state phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model is the topic of section  [ sec : phasediagram ] . in section  [ sec : transition ] we discuss the first - order transition that controls the physics of the phase diagram .",
    "section  [ sec : thermodynamics ] contains the thermodynamic properties of the phases separated by the transition .",
    "the characterization of these phases continues in section  [ sec : phases ] where a signature of critical behavior through a large scattering rate is found near the transition .",
    "we identify the physical origin of this critical behavior in the section  [ sec : plaquette ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we reexamine the phase diagram and propose a possible new scenario for the surmised criticality in high - temperature superconductors",
    ". it can originate not from a quantum critical point , nor from the proximity of a long - range ordered phase , but from a finite - temperature transition at finite doping coming from the influence of mott physics well beyond half - filling .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - dimensional hubbard model on a square lattice reads @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 operators annihilate and create electrons on site @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the number operator . in this article",
    "we focus on the physics arising from the proximity to a mott insulating state , so we use a simple hopping amplitude @xmath12 between nearest neighbors only , so that the bare dispersion , obtained from the fourier transform of @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 $ ] .",

    "( [ eq : hm ] ) onto a quantum impurity problem consisting of a cluster of sites , here a @xmath17 plaquette , embedded in a bath that is determined self - consistently in such a way that infinite lattice and plaquette have the same self - energy .",

    "( [ eq : action ] ) @xcite .",
    "here we use the recently developed continuous - time quantum monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "this approach relies on the monte carlo summation of all diagrams generated by the expansion of the cluster - bath ( impurity ) action eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to the hybridization @xmath21 . ref .",
    "contains the details of the present implementation .",
    "the ctqmc method is a powerful and perfectly adapted technique to map out the phase diagram of the hubbard model , because it permits to readily access all regions of doping , from large doping down to the mott insulating state , the intermediate to low temperature regime that have so far proven inaccessible with usual hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo  @xcite for instance , and a large range of @xmath0 with high efficiency  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this method is statistically exact and does not have errors associated with time discretization or bath parametrization , and therefore we can determine the phase diagram of the hubbard model with unparalleled accuracy .    to obtain high quality data , required to determine the phases of the system , we typically perform @xmath28 monte carlo sweeps per processor , averaged over 40 processors . when necessary , for example close to phase boundaries , we may do up to @xmath29 sweeps per processor averaged on 64 processors .",
    "cellular dmft is an iterative approach , and in generic regions of parameter space we have studied the cluster observables converge in less then @xmath30 iterations , but hundreds may be necessary close to phase boundaries .    in the actual ctqmc implementation ,",
    "it is useful to write cluster quantities , such as the hybridization @xmath21 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) , the cluster self - energy , or the cluster green function , in a diagonal form .",
    "since cellular dmft applies open boundary conditions on the cluster , the cluster momentum @xmath31 is not in general a good quantum number .",

    ", one must scan the phase diagram with an adapted fine grid . despite the algorithmic breakthroughs described in the previous section , that have become available only in the last few years",

    "specifically , we carried out scans at constant values of @xmath0 across the mott transition , varying the chemical potential for several temperatures . because the system is particle - hole symmetric ( @xmath51 is set to zero ) , we limited our study to hole doping only ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "for each value of @xmath0 , we performed calculations in a wide doping range , between @xmath54 and roughly @xmath55 .",
    "we found that scanning doping in intervals sometimes smaller as @xmath56 was necessary to identify the sequence of phases that occur upon doping the mott insulator .",

    "we summarize our results in the temperature @xmath1 versus interaction strength @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath14 phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "the scans at constant @xmath0 that we use to explore the three dimensional parameter space are visible as cross sections in the phase diagram and correspond to the distinct @xmath58 planes presented in fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the figures show two colored ( shaded ) regions in cross sections at constant @xmath0 in @xmath59 space .",
    "the first region ( light gray / yellow ) corresponds to the onset of the mott insulating phase , characterized by a plateau in the occupation at @xmath60 . just outside this region",
    "there is a metallic state .",
    "the second region ( dark gray / blue ) is the portion of parameter space where two different phases coexist . by interpolation between the distinct planes at constant @xmath0",
    ", one can therefore obtain the volume of both the mott phase and the phase coexistence region .",
    "it is important to understand that what we mean by coexistence region is a region where , in addition to the thermodynamically stable phase , a metastable phase can exist . since we do not have access to the free energy , we can not determine precisely the first order boundary , so instead we draw the region where metastable states exist . in practice ,",
    "if we change chemical potential slowly from small to large values or vice - versa , we can end up in different phases , one of which is thermodynamically unstable .",
    "going back to our phase diagram , let us first concentrate on the mott phase .",
    "two basic features emerge .",
    "first , as expected on physical grounds , a threshold value for the correlation strength , called @xmath61 , is a prerequisite for the emergence of mott insulating state .",
    "we estimate this point at @xmath62 .",
    "second , the projections on @xmath63 plane ( marked as light gray / yellow line on the 3d phase diagram ) reveal the characteristic @xmath64 shape onset of the mott insulating state , where the tip of the @xmath64 shape is @xmath61 ( only half of the @xmath64 shape is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] because of particle - hole symmetry ) .",
    "our most surprising results come , however , from the full mapping of the region ( dark gray / blue ) where two phases coexist in the @xmath65 space .",
    "we begin with a description of the peculiar shape of this region .",
    "let first consider the @xmath66 plane , where the model is half filled . in that plane",
    ", the coexistence region has a triangular shape that bends as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "the boundaries are the spinodal lines @xmath67 ( thick dashed blue line ) , where the metastable insulating phase disappears , and @xmath68 ( thin dashed blue line ) , where the metastable metallic phase ceases to exists .",
    "these spinodals end at a critical value of @xmath0 , called @xmath69 , with coordinates @xmath70 . in the @xmath66 plane ,",
    "the region of coexistence marks a portion of parameter space where the mott insulator coexists with a metal .",
    "surprisingly , this is in general not so in the 3d phase diagram where the coexistence region is not fully included in the region where the mott phase exists . to show this ,",
    "let us consider scans at constant @xmath0 .",
    "the region where two phases coexist naturally extends from the @xmath66 plane to finite values of the chemical potential @xmath14 and is enclosed by the spinodal surfaces @xmath71 and @xmath72 that end at a critical line @xmath73 ( dotted blue line in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",

    "as we discuss in the next section , two metallic phases coexist in that region .",

    "the precise location of the first order surface can be computed by comparing the free energy of the two solutions , a task beyond the present work .",
    "second , the two solutions merge at a finite temperature @xmath73 where the spinodal surfaces @xmath83 and @xmath84 end .",
    "this implies that a second - order transition line ( dotted blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) exists at the end of the surface of first - order transition . except for the critical mott endpoint @xmath69",

    "the first - order transition surface originates at the half - filled mott critical endpoint and moves progressively away from half - filling as the interaction @xmath0 increases .",
    "therefore the first - order transition can occur between a metallic phase and a mott insulating phase , or , unexpectedly , between two metallic phases , one of which evolves continuously from the mott insulator .",
    "the former case ( metal to insulator transition ) occurs whenever the volume of the mott insulating phase intercepts the volume of the phase coexistence in the @xmath65 parameter space . as discussed above",
    ", this occurs at the @xmath66 plane ( i.e. at half filling ) , where the metallic and the insulating solutions of the cellular dmft equations coexist . in the @xmath58 planes too , the mott insulator can coexist with a metal , as indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig2],[fig3 ] by different shade of gray ( corresponding to the light gray / dark gray ",

    "hysteresis in the occupation curves @xmath87 , found for @xmath89 and low temperatures , provides a direct demonstration of the first - order nature of the transition .",
    "the curves at @xmath95 do not show hysteresis down to @xmath96 , but several signatures indicate that the system is getting close to the transition and hence suggest that the hysteresis loop falls below the lowest temperature we investigate . to reach this conclusion , first we notice that a close inspection of the @xmath87 curves at @xmath76 , which lie above the critical interaction @xmath97 , shows that the temperature @xmath73 dramatically decreases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "indeed , the critical line begins at the mott point at @xmath98 and decreases to @xmath99 in going from @xmath97 to @xmath100 .",
    "second , by examining the high - temperature precursors of the transition , we can infer about the existence of the first - order transition at large values of @xmath0 . a thermodynamic indicator that signals",
    "the proximity to the second - order transition line is a peak in the compressibility @xmath101 as a function of doping that develops at temperatures well above @xmath73 and reaches its maximum at @xmath73 ( see also discussion of fig .  [ fig16 ] ) .",
    "we found this precursor of @xmath73 for all values of @xmath102 at progressively larger doping as @xmath0 increases .",
    "another signature that can be identified as a precursor of the transition is the approximate vanishing of the expansion coefficient @xmath103 ( crossing point of the isotherms in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this signal occurs close to the spinodal line @xmath75 and extends to temperature well above @xmath73 .",
    "this feature occurs for all values of @xmath104 and at progressively larger doping as @xmath0 increases .",
    "our results show these high temperature precursory signatures of the transition ( other indicators will be discussed is sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) for all values of the correlation strength @xmath102 and hence point toward a critical temperature decreasing with @xmath0 and occurring at progressively larger doping as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we estimate that the critical doping at which @xmath73 occurs moves from zero doping at the mott point @xmath97 , to @xmath105 at @xmath100 , and to @xmath106 at @xmath107 .",
    "some of the thermodynamic effects close to @xmath73 will be analyzed in more detail in the next section .",
    "here we note that the physics arising from the second - order critical line strongly modifies not only the thermodynamic response , but also the dynamics : as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : phases ] , there is a funnel - shaped region above the critical line where scattering is anomalously large .",
    "such precursory signals strongly indicate the occurrence of the first - order transition surface ending at a finite temperature second - order transition line for @xmath102 and thus also for @xmath108 for temperature lower than the range we explored .",
    "in addition , these precursory signals take place not only for all values of @xmath102 , but also without apparent qualitative change .",
    "this suggests to disfavor other interpretations where a qualitative change in these high temperature signatures is expected , like the possibility that the critical line ending our first order transition becomes a quantum critical line or point  @xcite , or a tricritical point at some @xmath0 .",
    "additional support for the approach of a finite @xmath1 second - order transition line follows from the critical slowing down observed in our ctqmc calculations close to that line .",
    "critical slowing down is a widespread and standard indicator  @xcite that the system is near a critical threshold .",
    "we find enhancement of monte carlo fluctuations and also enhancement of the number of the cellular dmft iterations to attain self - consistency as the model parameters approach @xmath73 .",
    "to obtain reliable results , a large number of monte carlo samplings and of the order of hundreds of iterations are used in our numerical simulations .",
    "this effect is well documented in single - site dmft studies of the mott transition  @xcite . in cellular dmft investigations",
    ", it is reported in ref .   at @xmath107 around @xmath109",
    "; here we detect this phenomenon down to @xmath69 at progressively smaller doping , hence linking the critical slowing down to mott physics .",
    "having established the first - order character of the transition , we now focus on the thermodynamic properties of the phases that this transition separates .",
    "we discuss four basic features .",
    "first we prove that these phases are thermodynamically stable .",
    "we start from the fundamental thermodynamic relation @xmath110 where it is understood that energy @xmath111 , entropy @xmath112 , number of particle @xmath2 and double occupancy @xmath113 are normalized per lattice site .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath114 , so it is natural to use the grand canonical potential @xmath115 .",
    "the appropriate legendre transform leads to @xmath116 from the expression for @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defdo ] ) and @xmath118 from now on , we have @xmath119 the concavity of the entropy implies that the grand canonical potential is minimum at equilibrium .",
    "thus : @xmath120 if we consider a constant @xmath1 plane the last relation is obeyed if @xmath121 i.e. if the compressibility is positive . in the general case ,",
    "we need to add the requirement that the eigenvalues of the above matrix be negative , i.e that the determinant be positive : @xmath122 notice that the specific heat @xmath123 must be positive as a consequence of the above two inequalities . given @xmath124 and the expression for @xmath125 , eq .",
    "[ eq : de ] , we can extract the specific heat from our data since it has the equivalent expression : @xmath126    .particle density @xmath2 , compressibility @xmath127 , expansion coefficient @xmath128 , derivative of total energy @xmath129 and the determinant eq .",
    "[ eq : stability ] .",
    "the first ( last ) two lines correspond to values of @xmath2 in the ud ( od ) phase .",
    "other data parameters are : @xmath130 , and the derivatives are taken at @xmath131 which lies below @xmath73 . the determinant is positive , implying the thermodynamic stability of both the ud and od phases . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    clearly fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that @xmath132 . as an example",
    ", we display these quantities for a few points in table i to demonstrate that the stability condition is satisfied .",
    "the data are for @xmath130 and @xmath131 which lies below @xmath133 .",
    "the determinant eq .",
    "[ eq : stability ] and @xmath134 are positive for all values displayed .",
    "second , the surprising result that emerges from our calculations is the possibility of a first - order transition between two paramagnetic metallic phases .",
    "the filling @xmath2 is one direct way to discriminate the two phases that coexist below the second - order transition line : the od phase at lower filling and the ud phase at higher filling .",
    "third , the clausius - clapeyron relations reveal that the ud phase has smaller entropy and smaller double occupancy than the od phase .",
    "the proof works as follows . along the first order transition boundary ,",
    "the grand potential @xmath115 is identical in the two phases .",
    "this means that if we move along the first - order transition line on either side , the change in @xmath115 is the same in both phases : @xmath135 .",
    "if we consider a constant @xmath0 plane ( @xmath118 ) and indicate by subscript c quantities measured along the first order transition line , it immediately follows that @xmath136 our calculation shows that @xmath137 increases as @xmath138 increases ( i.e. the first - order line bends toward the mott insulator ) .",
    "this implies that the ud phase has a lower entropy than the od phase . in an analogous way , by taking a constant @xmath1 plane , one obtains @xmath139 our calculations show that @xmath138 decreases as @xmath140 increases .",
    "hence , the ud phase has lower double occupancy than the od phase .",
    "this is as expected and suggests again that in the ud phase the correlations are stronger .",
    "finally , it is important to stress that the entropy exhibits a maximum as a function of doping or chemical potential in close proximity to the spinodal surface @xmath72 and its high temperature crossover , .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "above the critical coupling @xmath68 , and for the temperature range explored in our work , the isotherms in the @xmath141 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] approximately cross at a finite value of doping .",
    "that doping where the isotherms cross increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the crossing of the isotherms translates into a vanishing expansion coefficient @xmath142 and thus into an extremum in the entropy @xmath143 since from the grand potential eq .",
    "[ eq : defdo ] we have the maxwell relation @xmath144 as long as the compressibility @xmath145 is not singular , this also implies @xmath146 because from @xmath147 we can write @xmath148 that in turn leads to @xmath149 the extremum of entropy as a function of filling is reported also in refs .  .",
    "the physical origin of a peak of entropy as a function of doping will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : plaquette ] .",
    "here we can anticipate that this feature results from reorganization of the basic electronic excitations of the systems across the od - ud transition .",
    "our results show that the normal - state phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model is controlled by a first - order transition between a metal and either a mott insulator or another metal that evolves continuously from the mott insulating state .",
    "the phases separated by this transition have the same symmetry but different thermodynamic properties , like density , compressibility , entropy , double occupancy .    in this section",
    "we further characterize the nature of the sequence of phases that arises upon doping .",
    "we discuss the cluster green s function and the cluster self - energy that contain direct information about the effects of electronic correlations .",
    "our main finding is that critical behavior , as seen in a large scattering rate , originates from the spinodal surface @xmath71 that delimits the underdoped phase . as the carrier concentration moves away from that transition , towards both low or high doping , coherent electronic behavior is recovered .",
    "we begin with a specific example . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of the cluster green s function for several dopings at @xmath150 , above @xmath69 , and at low temperature @xmath96 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : methodology ] , in the @xmath17 plaquette scheme the cluster green s function in cluster momentum basis is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 . these elements can be thought to represent a coarse grained average of the lattice green s function over part of the brillouin zone .",
    "the curves display a systematic evolution as the mott insulating state is approached .",
    "let us analyze the low frequency behavior of the real and imaginary parts of the cluster green s function .",
    "the extrapolated value of im@xmath155 is an estimate of the local density of states at the fermi level , a quantity accessible in photoemission experiments .",
    "for all dopings shown , the @xmath37 component carries most of the spectral weight at the fermi level . at large values of doping ,",
    "the imaginary part is finite in all orbitals ( orbitals refer to @xmath156 values ) , showing that the system is metallic ( see curves with circles ) .",
    "this behavior distinguishes the overdoped phase . on the other hand , at zero doping ,",
    "the imaginary part goes to zero for all orbitals , so it indicates insulating mott behavior for all cluster momenta ( see curves with crosses ) . in between these two regions ,",
    "the imaginary part remains finite in the orbital @xmath37 and @xmath33 , while it shows a clear tendency to go to zero in orbital @xmath35 ( see curves with square symbols ) .",
    "this implies that the former two orbitals are metallic and the latter is insulating , in striking contrast with the od and non - interacting cases .",
    "this phenomenon of strong momentum space differentiation  @xcite characterizes the ud phase and has a transparent physical interpretation : doping the mott insulator occurs gradually in certain cluster momenta , leading to emergence of metallic behavior in some regions of the brillouin zone but not in others .",
    "physically , this feature is the coarse - grained manifestation of the continuous appearance of the fermi surface out of the mott insulating state . in the @xmath17 plaquette scheme ,",
    "the cluster momentum differentiation in the ud phase found in the low frequency behavior of im@xmath157 is compatible with arc or pocket formation on the fermi surface .",
    "distinguishing between these scenarios falls outside the scope of the present study .",
    "one has to rely on periodization schemes to obtain the lattice green s function  @xcite .",
    "another possibility , recently explored in the context of dca calculations , is to consider progressively larger clusters  @xcite .",
    "other band structure effects not included here can also be important  @xcite .",

    "the opposite sign is found for the orbital @xmath35 , meaning that it has most of the low frequency spectral weight above the fermi energy . in sharp contrast",
    ", the plot of re@xmath160 reveals a change of sign at a characteristic doping .",
    "this means particle - hole symmetry of the @xmath37 orbital at that doping , which is remarkably close to the doping where the above mentioned strong momentum space differentiation in img@xmath161 sets in .",
    "we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] that this property is closely associated with the large scattering rate found near the critical transition line .",
    "so far we have given a qualitative overview of our data for a single value of @xmath0 and a single low temperature that is nevertheless higher than first - order transition line @xmath73 .",
    "this set of results points to the following picture .",
    "metallic behavior in all orbitals characterizes overdoped phase .",
    "strong modulation of spectral weight at the fermi level , where @xmath37 and @xmath33 orbitals are metallic and @xmath35 is gapped or damped , signals the onset of the underdoped phase . in between these two phases ,",
    "the @xmath37 orbital becomes strikingly symmetric at low frequency .",
    "to understand if these are genuine properties of the phase diagram , we compile the zero - frequency extrapolation of the imaginary and real parts of the cluster green s function for a large range of dopings and temperatures .",
    "we first discuss the behavior of im@xmath162 as a function of doping , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6](a)-(h ) for different values of @xmath0 . to emphasize the cluster momentum differentiation",
    ", each figure has two panels containing data for the orbital @xmath163 ( curves with circles in the upper panel ) and @xmath35 ( curves with triangles in the lower panel ) .",
    "the @xmath33 orbital behaves similarly to the @xmath37 one and is not shown .",
    "the @xmath37 orbital contains most of the spectral weight at the fermi level and shows the largest temperature variation . below the second - order critical line , two solutions of the cellular dmft equations",
    "coexist for each orbital @xmath156 . in the overdoped phase im@xmath162",
    "goes to a finite value for all orbitals @xmath156 , revealing the metallic nature of this phase . on the other hand , in the underdoped phase the @xmath37 and @xmath33 components of im@xmath162 go to a sizable value , except asymptotically close to zero doping , while the @xmath35 orbital remains basically gapped or with a very small value .",
    "the gray ( orange ) background in the lower panels highlights this region for the lowest temperature shown . at the spinodal surfaces @xmath83 and @xmath84 these two solutions exhibit an abrupt jump in each orbitals : from essentially zero to a finite value in the case of @xmath164 , and from a finite value to a larger value in the case of @xmath163 and @xmath33 ( see @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) . above the critical end line",
    "the two solutions merge and the transition between the two phases occurs as a crossover .",
    "since @xmath73 decreases with increasing @xmath0 , an immediate implication of our results is the following : a study focusing _ only _ on a large interaction strength @xmath0 will detect the changes in im@xmath162 , but not the underlying transition between two metals at finite doping , due to the low energy scales involved ( see @xmath167 ) . on the contrary , our exhaustive scan of the 3d phase diagram allows us to show a direct link between the momentum differentiation and the finite doping first - order transition .",
    "we note that in the ud phase , im@xmath168 does not actually seem to extrapolate exactly to zero , but rather to a vanishingly small value .",
    "even if the extrapolated value decreases as @xmath1 is lowered , and turns from sublinear to overlinear dependence on doping , we rationalize this feature by the fact that in cellular dmft the orbitals @xmath156 are coupled through both the coulomb interaction @xmath0 and the hopping , making difficult a sharp decoupling among the orbitals at finite temperature . the latter behavior is found for example in dca calculations  @xcite , where the coupling among the orbitals occurs through the interaction @xmath0 only .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the extrapolated values of the real part of the cluster green s function , re@xmath162 , a measure of the particle - hole symmetry of the orbitals at low frequency . here",
    "the most striking feature is the change of sign in the @xmath37 component that occurs , apart from the obvious particle - hole symmetric line @xmath66 , at @xmath169 , at the spinodal surface @xmath72 that signals the disappearance of the od phase .",
    "this feature is not restricted to temperatures below the critical line @xmath73 but also continues for temperatures above it .",
    "precious information about the nature of the two phases separated by the first - order transition follows from the analysis of the cluster self - energy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we present a selection of self - energies for the same parameter values as in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "an instructive way to look at the data is to consider the concept of fermi liquid coherence _ within the cluster momentum_. in landau",
    "s fermi liquid theory the low energy excitations of an interacting system can be described as long - lived particles , called quasiparticles .",
    "this fermi liquid regime applies below a characteristic temperature , the coherence temperature , and a necessary condition for its existence is that the imaginary part of the self - energy goes to zero as @xmath170 with the form @xmath171 with @xmath172 negative .",
    "the self - energy of both the @xmath33 and @xmath35 orbitals in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] obeys this relation for all the metallic states ( circles and squares ) of the doped mott insulator , revealing fermi liquid coherence of the electronic excitations .",
    "note that the linear low frequency behavior of im@xmath173 and im@xmath174 persists in the mott insulating state ( lines with crosses ) , where the particles are localized .",
    "there the system is gapped ( see the corresponding low frequency vanishing behavior of im@xmath175 and im@xmath176 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the imaginary part of the @xmath37 self - energy shows a non - monotonic behavior as a function of doping .",
    "the metallic state at both large and small doping displays fermi liquid coherence ( im@xmath177 goes linearly to zero ) , but at intermediate doping , at the crossover between the underdoped - overdoped phases , the large finite intercept indicates a sudden drop of electronic coherence ( see curves for @xmath178 ) .",
    "finally , the mott insulating state is reached and a clear pole appears in the imaginary part of the @xmath37 self - energy at @xmath169 and @xmath66 .",
    "the main results of the above analysis are a buildup of incoherent metallic behavior close to the first - order transition and its high temperature crossover .",
    "it is of key importance to investigate if this picture survives in the whole phase diagram . to this end",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the effective chemical potential , which corresponds to the chemical potential renormalized by correlation effects , and is defined by @xmath179 . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we plot the scattering rate @xmath180 , estimated from the zero - frequency extrapolation of the imaginary part of the cluster self - energy @xmath181 .",
    "although these quantities are not strictly equal , we will use them interchangeably .",
    "we use a linear interpolation and we have verified that a quadratic interpolation gives qualitatively similar results . for clarity",
    "we show results only for the orbitals @xmath163 ( circles ) and @xmath35 ( triangles ) .",
    "the most important result , shown in the upper panels of fig .  [ fig10 ] , is a large scattering rate @xmath182 for a finite range of dopings peaked at the first - order transition between two types of metals .",
    "a large scattering rate is in conflict with fermi liquid theory and indicates that short - lived ( i.e. incoherent ) excitations , and not long - lived quasiparticle , produce the metallic behavior in that regime .",
    "nevertheless , if one goes away from the transition , the scattering rate rapidly drops to small values and thus crosses over to a conventional fermi liquid with small intercept .",
    "the overall behavior of @xmath182 unequivocally shows that the source of scattering comes from the transition between the underdoped and the overdoped phase .",
    "some recent studies , using different cluster methods , already reported a peak in the scattering rate at finite doping , associating it to a pseudogap phenomenon@xcite , to a competing superexchange and kondo scale@xcite , or to a selective metal - insulator transition@xcite .",
    "our contribution is twofold : first , we link this feature to the spinodal @xmath183 and its high temperature precursor ; second , by tracking this feature in the @xmath184 phase diagram , we show that it is connected to the mott endpoint @xmath69 , hence unveiling its unexpected origin in the mott physics .",
    "let us study in detail the behavior of the self - energy in the two phases .",
    "the _ overdoped phase _ has a rich behavior as doping is reduced towards the first - order transition surface . at large doping , far from the transition , the effective chemical potential of all orbitals merges , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "this is clear at large @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "[ fig9](g),(h ) ) and indeed occurs at smaller values of @xmath0 for similar dopings ( not shown ) .",
    "hence , the self - energy is local ( momentum independent ) and the single - site dmft solution captures the physics of the problem . as the transition is approached , @xmath185 for different @xmath156 separate .",
    "similar trend has been found in dca calculations for different sizes of cluster  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scattering rate @xmath180 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] is quite small , decreases with decreasing @xmath1 and monotonically increases as the doping is reduced towards the first - order transition surface .",
    "eventually , at the spinodal @xmath186 , @xmath187 shows a sudden jump ( figs .",
    "[ fig9],[fig10 ] ) and interestingly the effective chemical potential of the orbital that carries most of the spectral weight at the fermi level , @xmath188 , changes sign .",
    "the overall low frequency behavior of im@xmath189 within the overdoped phase indicates that the system is a strongly interacting fermi liquid and the effects of electronic correlations dramatically increase as the first - order transition or its high temperature crossover are approached .",
    "let s now turn to the _ underdoped phase _ that originates from the mott insulator .",
    "the analysis of the cluster green s function revealed that the @xmath35 orbital is gapped but the other orbitals are gapless .",
    "close to the mott insulator and at low enough temperature , the scattering rate @xmath190 is small and decreases as @xmath1 decreases . as the the boundary with the first - order transition to the overdoped phase is approached , @xmath190 increases and eventually reaches its maximum close to the spinodal surface @xmath71 or near the crossover line above the critical line .",
    "a further confirmation of this picture emerges from the striking temperature evolution of @xmath190 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . as the temperature increases , the value of @xmath190 at its maximum increases as does its width in doping .",
    "interestingly , the lower is @xmath73 the higher is the temperature range at which the value of the @xmath37 scattering rate displays a maximum with doping .",
    "note that the overall maximum as a function of @xmath0 peaks around @xmath69 , relating directly this phenomenon to mott physics .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath35 orbital is insulating and therefore @xmath191 looses its usual meaning of a scattering rate . in search for a possible explanation ,",
    "we note that , in the temperature range explored , @xmath192 has a large value , that can even exceed the noninteracting bandwidth for sufficient large @xmath0 , as marked by the hatched grey lines in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ]  f , g , h .",
    "it has also been discussed , in the context of dca framework and for @xmath150 , that a pole in the self - energy is responsible for the insulating behavior  @xcite .",
    "our cellular dmft results for @xmath107 can be compatible with the existence of that pole , however for smaller values of @xmath0 that pole seems not to be present or is strongly reduced , as was already pointed out in ref .  .",
    "even if this mechanism remains to be better clarified , our contribution is to track the origin of the large scattering rate to the spinodal surface @xmath83 and its high temperature crossover .    finally , we stress that the coherence of the @xmath37 orbital in the underdoped phase at low doping , as signaled by the vanishing of the corresponding scattering rate in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , does not imply that the system as a whole is a fermi liquid . as discussed before ,",
    "the @xmath35 orbital remains gapped in this phase suggesting a `` small '' fermi surface compatible with arc or pocket formation .",
    "in other words , it is more likely that in the underdoped phase electronic coherence does not result from quasiparticle propagation but from another mechanism yet to be identified . in the next section",
    "we shall argue that coherence behavior is associated to hole doped carriers moving in a background of spin singlets formed by the superexchange mechanism .",
    "what picture emerges from the analysis of cluster quantities ?",
    "breakdown of fermi liquid behavior , revealed by a dramatic enhancement of scattering rate @xmath190 , is realized over a large region of the phase diagram close to the first - order transition between the underdoped and overdoped metals and reaches its overall maximum at the mott endpoint @xmath69 .",
    "thus our results pin down that incoherent states come from mott physics , even for regions way beyond half filling . as we move away from the transition , the lifetime of the low energy excitations of the metallic state sharply increases .",
    "fermi liquid breakdown beyond half filling is unambiguously tied to mott physics .",
    "the last piece of this puzzling scenario is to identify the physical mechanism driving this unconventional behavior .",
    "this is the focus of the next section .",
    "to shed light on the physical origin of the incoherent metallic behavior associated with the first - order transition , we now turn to the analysis of the short - range spin correlations .",
    "in fact , cellular dmft takes into account on equal footing local quantum fluctuations and finite length spatial fluctuations ( within the cluster size , here a @xmath17 plaquette ) .",
    "the inclusion of spatial correlations manifests itself mathematically in the non locality of the self - energy  @xcite . in this section",
    "we first compare our cellular dmft phase diagram with that of single - site dmft , where magnetic correlations in space are absent .",
    "the differences between the two phase diagrams directly reveals the effects of the short - range correlations .",
    "then we characterize the phases that occur across the transition in terms of these fluctuations .",
    "as we shall see , in the mott insulating state the electrons are localized due to strong screened coulomb interaction and their spins lock into singlets states due to the superexchange mechanism . in the ud phase , i.e. the metallic state that evolves out of the mott insulator , the system is still dominated by singlet states and metallic behavior is associated with doped charge carriers that propagate in a background of spins with strong singlet correlations due to superexchange . finally , in the od phase",
    ", the basic excitations of the system are quasiparticles due to conventional kondo screening .",
    "there are analogies with the suggestion of ref .  .",
    "a natural way to understand the effects of the short - range spin correlations on the mott transition is to compare our cellular dmft phase diagram , fig.[fig2 ] , that accounts for these magnetic correlations , with that of single - site dmft , where those correlations are absent .",
    "sustained investigations have firmly set the single - site scenario for the mott transition in the single band hubbard model  @xcite and the resulting phase diagram as a function of chemical potential , interaction strength and temperature can be found for instance in ref .  . here",
    "the key phenomenon that governs the whole phase diagram is a finite temperature first - order transition originating at the finite temperature mott critical point .",
    "this transition occurs between a mott insulator and a correlated metallic state , and can take place as a function of either @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath14 .",
    "similarly to the single - site dmft case , a first - order transition dominates the normal - state phase diagram also in the cellular dmft case , as we demonstrated in the previous sections .",
    "but the nature of this first - order transition is different and the fundamental difference comes from short - range spin correlations considered in cellular dmft .",
    "three main effects can be identified .",
    "first , they reduce the value of the mott endpoint @xmath69 .",
    "this is as expected because the threshold to open a mott gap increases as the frustration at short - distance increases @xcite .",
    "second , the short - range magnetic correlations change the shape of the spinodal lines  @xcite . in single - site dmft",
    "the boundary of the first - order transition bends towards the correlated metallic state ( as a function of either the interaction strength @xmath0 or the chemical potential @xmath14 ) , so that the insulating phase can be reached upon increasing the temperature of the system . according to the clausius - clapeyron equation",
    "this comes from the fact that the correlated metallic state has lower entropy than the mott insulating state .",
    "this behavior occurs in several correlated systems , like close to the first - order transition line in @xmath193  @xcite .",
    "physically , this is because in taking the large lattice connectivity limit to justify single - site dmft , the magnetic exchange coupling between two neighboring spins drops out , thus resulting in a paramagnetic mott insulator with large spin degeneracy of order @xmath194 ( where @xmath16 is the number of lattice site )  @xcite . as discussed in section  [ sec : thermodynamics ] , the opposite behavior occurs in cellular dmft , where the first - order transition bends towards the mott insulating state .",
    "this reveals that the ud state ( and its parent mott insulating phase ) has lower entropy than the od metallic state as a consequence of short - range singlet formation that lifts the @xmath195 degeneracy due to the spins of the localized electrons  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the phase boundary of cellular dmft at half - filling is observed in low - dimensional correlated systems , such as the organic conductors  @xcite .",
    "the third and arguably the most surprising effect brought about by the short - range magnetic correlations is the mere appearance of the ud phase in the cellular dmft phase diagram . in both single - site and cellular dmft solutions , the @xmath72 surface marks the vanishing of a correlated metallic solution . on the other hand",
    ", the spinodal @xmath71 always marks the vanishing of the insulating solution within single - site dmft , whereas as we demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : transition] , this is generally not the case within cellular dmft .",
    "doping instead proceeds gradually in certain cluster momenta .",
    "we stress that the apparent gradual doping of the mott insulator observed over an extremely narrow range of dopings (  @xmath56 , i.e. at least @xmath196 times smaller than what we find ) in single - site dmft is purely a finite temperature effect . in our case ,",
    "short - range magnetic correlations do have the effect of shifting the spinodal surface @xmath71 to _ finite _ values of doping , implying that the first order transition can take place between two metallic phases ( the ud and od phases ) instead of between an insulator and a metal .",
    "thus the ud phase occurs only in the cluster dmft case and traces its roots to the short range - singlet formation .      having established the basic effects of the short range - spatial correlations on the structure of the phase diagram , we now concentrate in the relative importance of various many body states in the cellular dmft solution of the hubbard model . to address this issue we scrutinize the relative statistical weight of the eigenstates @xmath197 of the plaquette hamiltonian @xmath198 . in the context of dmft calculations ,",
    "the analysis of the eigenstates of the quantum impurity problem has proven to lead to useful insights on the role of short - range spatial magnetic correlations  @xcite and also helped to construct a physical picture of the nature of the doped carriers  @xcite .",
    "cellular dmft maps the lattice onto a @xmath17 cluster of sites immersed in a self - consistent bath .",

    "it is possible to compute the statistical weight @xmath201 of the eigenstates @xmath202 of the plaquette ( see refs .",
    "for a rigorous definition ) .",

    "[ fig11 ] we plot the probability of the plaquette eigenstates for @xmath107 for values representative of the mott insulating state ( fig .  [ fig11](a ) ) , the ud phase ( fig .  [ fig11](b ) ) , and the od phase ( fig .  [ fig11](c ) ) .",
    "results are shown for the high temperature @xmath203 and the low temperature @xmath204 ( left and right respectively ) .",
    "focusing on the region of parameters close to the first - order transition , we find that there are only a few plaquette eigenstates with large probability .",
    "they are the singlet with four electrons in the cluster momentum @xmath205 ( black portions of the diagram ) : @xmath206 the triplet with four electrons and @xmath164 ( red portion of the diagrams ) : @xmath207 and the doublet with three electrons and @xmath163 and the degenerate @xmath208 ( blue portion of the diagrams ) .",
    "@xmath209 we sum up the probability of the remnant states ( green portion of the diagrams ) .",
    "the distribution of the statistical weight in the mott insulator and ud phase is similar as does its evolution with temperature .",
    "this is expected since the ud phase evolves out of the mother mott insulating phase .",
    "let us now summarize the three main differences between the two metallic phases .",
    "first , in the ud phase the plaquette electrons are locked into one prevailing configuration ( half - filled singlet ) , whereas in the od phase they fluctuate among several states .",
    "second , the temperature evolution of the plaquette eigenstates qualitatively differs in the two phases . while charge excitations are weakly @xmath1 dependent in both phases , the basic effect of decreasing the temperature",
    "strongly suppresses the spin triplet excitations in favor of the spin singlet ones , especially in the ud phase .",
    "this has to be associated with the @xmath1 dependence of the local density of states at fermi level shown in fig .",
    "third , the mechanism behind coherence is also qualitatively different in the two phases . in the od phase we associate the onset of coherence to standard kondo screening of the conduction electrons of the bath in which the plaquette is immersed .",
    "in contrast , coherent propagation in the ud phase occurs when doped holes move in a magnetically well defined environment characterized by spins bounded into short - range singlet correlations via the antiferromagnetic superexchange mechanism .",
    "taking the perspective of the quantum impurity model immersed in a self - consistent bath is the best way to show this point . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we show the statistical weight of the main plaquette states as a function of doping and for several temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] we show the extrapolated zero - frequency value of the imaginary part of the cluster hybridization function as a function of doping and for different temperatures . the onset of the mott insulating state ( @xmath169 for @xmath102 ) is signaled by a dramatic growth of the half filled singlet probability ( black circles ) . in the mott state",
    "the half - filled singlet dominates and its probability increases with increasing interaction strength @xmath0 .",
    "the cluster hybridization function represents the effect of the bath in which the plaquette is immersed and with which electrons are exchanged .",
    "it is gapped at the fermi level for all cluster momenta ( i.e. im@xmath210 ) .",
    "together , the insulating character of the reservoir and the single dominant plaquette eigenstate indicate that the electrons of the lattice are localized and bound into short - range singlets due to superexchange interaction .    in the ud phase ,",
    "the @xmath211 plaquette is still mostly occupied by the half - filled singlet ( black squares ) , revealing that this phase evolves out of the parent mott insulator .",
    "however , doping the mott state populates other plaquette eigenstates and the system begins to fluctuate between the half - filled singlet and other configurations .",
    "not surprisingly , the primary fluctuations introduced by doping are charge excitations , as shown by the increase of the weight of the doublet at @xmath212 ( blue circle ) with increasing doping . in a smaller measure , the probability of the spin triplet excitations ( red triangles ) also grows with doping .",
    "interestingly , spin excitations ( both of singlet and triplet type ) show a larger temperature dependence than the charge excitations .",
    "note also that the probability of the half - filled singlet saturates below a characteristic temperature .",
    "the previous sections have demonstrated the metallic , compressible character of the ud phase .",
    "the fluctuations among various plaquette configurations are allowed by the self - consistent bath , which in this phase is metallic ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) and depends only weakly on the cluster momentum , consistent with singlets states within the plaquette that dominate the behavior of the system .",
    "our results thus suggest to consider the ud phase as a phase in which the doped - hole carriers propagate into a sea of spins bounded into a @xmath213 short - range singlet state ( a similar interpretation for low doping phase of the @xmath214 model was suggested in refs .  ) . we can therefore rationalize why this phase is coherent at low @xmath1 , as revealed by the small scattering rate in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] : as soon as the spins pair up into singlet pairs , the doped holes have no difficulty to delocalize coherently into the background of singlet states .",
    "we now examine the od phase . here",
    "there is no dominant plaquette eigenstate , and the electrons within the plaquette fluctuate among several states .",
    "electrons spend comparable time visiting the doublet at @xmath213 , the half - filled singlet and triplet . also important",
    "are other types of excitations . at large doping ,",
    "the charge excitations becomes important , so the probability of the doublet at @xmath212 is the largest . as the transition is approached , the weight of these excitations decreases , while that of the singlet increases .",
    "the temperature dependence of the plaquette eigenstates is weak and mostly confined to excitations of spins ( both singlet and triplet ) . to complete our survey of the od phase we analyze the effect of the bath in which the plaquette is immersed , fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "we find that the cluster hybridization function displays metallic behavior and weak cluster momentum differentiation , especially as the finite - doping transition is approached .",
    "these results for the od phase support a qualitatively different picture compared with the ud phase . at the level of the quantum cluster impurity problem ,",
    "the od phase is characterized by the electrons of the plaquette fluctuating among several configurations in a conducting bath . here",
    "the bath plays a central role , since the electrons of the metallic bath screens the fluctuating moments via the kondo effect .",
    "the objects that delocalize in the lattice are both spin and charge excitations compatible with landau quasiparticles that carry both spin and charge . as a further support to this picture",
    ", we stress that at large doping , far from the transition , we recover the results of single - site dmft , where the spatial fluctuations are absent and where the kondo screening mechanism controls the physics of the model .",
    "the central question then is : how can the system go from the od phase to the ud phase ? at the level of the plaquette , the transition between the two phases results from the competition between singlet spin excitations and spin triplet plus charge excitations .",
    "a simple way to quantify the increased importance of spin triplet - charge fluctuations at the expense of the singlet across the transition , is to monitor when the probability of the singlet state equals the probability of other plaquette states , i.e. when @xmath215 ( green solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "this occurs roughly at the ud - od transition .",
    "the competing spin - charge excitation close to the transition was already reported in our recent study , ref .  .",
    "there , we emphasized the interplay between the doublet and the spin excitations .",
    "close to the critical coupling @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "[ fig12]b , c , d , e ) we linked the coexistence region to the crossing of the probability between the triplet and the doublet states . in the present study , which explores a larger region of interaction strength @xmath0 and temperatures , we rather highlight the competing singlet spin versus triplet - spin and charge fluctuations .",
    "this aims to refine our previous study because the crossing @xmath215 tracks both the first - order transition at low temperatures and its high temperature crossover providing a more general framework for interpreting our results in the whole range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 explored .",
    "we can now address the crucial question of the origin of large scattering rate close the the @xmath83 surface and its high temperature crossover analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phases ] .",
    "the results of the plaquette eigenstates describe competing  @xcite superexchange and kondo interactions that give rise to unquenched short - range magnetic fluctuations of the electrons within the plaquette .",
    "this identifies the source of scattering close to the transition between the ud and od phase .",
    "the above description takes the point of view of the cluster coupled to a bath .",
    "the cellular dmft results have also a complementary interpretation in terms of the lattice . in the od phase the electrons on the lattice are coherent because they fill the available @xmath216 states as in a fermi liquid  @xcite . at zero temperature , this quenches the entropy . here",
    "the @xmath216 space picture is appropriate . on the other hand , in the ud phase",
    "the electrons pair up into short - range singlets and doped charge carriers can move coherently into a background of singlet bonds . here",
    "a real - space picture is more appropriate .",
    "starting at large doping and reducing @xmath49 towards the transition to the ud phase , the electrons reorganize their motion according to the strength of short - range magnetic spin correlation that increase as the mott state at @xmath169 is approached .",
    "breaking of the electrons as entities carrying both spin and charge occurs at the finite doping transition .",
    "this releases entropy as confirmed in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermodynamics ] .",
    "once the new excitations in the form of short range singlets are formed , and the system get settled into a magnetically stable configuration at low @xmath1 , the system can acquire again coherence .",
    "this perspective identifies the reorganization of the basic excitations of the system at the transition between the od and ud phase as the source of scattering .",
    "such reorganization also occurs in some recent theoretical proposals that envision a fractionalisation of the electrons  @xcite .",

    "[ fig14 ] as a function of doping for several values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the mott insulating phase",
    "this quantity vanishes as temperature is lowered , revealing that the system is locked into @xmath220 singlet states due to the superexchange interaction .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with single - site dmft where the corresponding local spin susceptibility diverges in the mott state . as the doping",
    "is increased , @xmath221 grows approximate linearly with doping .",
    "this characterizes the ud phase and reinforces the view of this region as a phase with hole - doped carriers propagating in a background of singlet states . on the other hand ,",
    "starting at large doping , a decrease of @xmath49 towards the transition has again the effect of slightly increasing @xmath221 .",
    "the mechanism however is different : spin and charge excitations are kondo screened by the conduction electrons of the bath . in a two - dimensional fermi liquid with spherical fermi surface , the spin susceptibility depends only on the density of states and is independent of doping in the non - interacting limit . here ,",
    "as the transition is approached with decreasing doping , @xmath221 increases slightly , then approximately saturates or slightly decreases , revealing the increased importance of the unquenched spin fluctuations in the plaquette as the transition is approached .",
    "notice also the opposite temperature behavior of @xmath221 within the two phases , again supporting the two different low lying elementary excitations in these two regions . in the ud phase in particular , the spin susceptibility decreases rapidly with temperature , in analogy with the spin - gap phenomenon found in high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "understanding the origin of the unusual behavior of copper oxide superconductors is a fascinating challenge for theorists and experimentalists alike .",
    "recent experiments are focusing on the normal state phase of these systems and are providing new clues on the critical behavior observed between the metallic state at high doping and the mott insulator at zero doping  @xcite . in an attempt to obtain a unified picture of these systems ,",

    "the fact that all signatures of the finite doping first - order transition can be traced back to the mott critical point reveals that the first - order transition between the ud and the od phase is associated with mott physics .",
    "this in turn implies that the signature of the mott transition in the two - dimensional hubbard model , normally expected to occur in close proximity to half - filling , extends way beyond half filling .",
    "this surprising conclusion  @xcite emerges naturally from the detailed mapping of the 3d normal state phase diagram .",

    "it would also be hard to make an unambiguous link between that transition at finite doping and the mott endpoint at zero doping .",
    "the map of the whole normal - state phase diagram , along with our discovery of a first - order transition originating at the half - filled mott critical point and moving progressively away from half - filling as @xmath0 increases , should help provide a unified picture of a host of previously known results and call for their reinterpretation as precursory signals of the transition we have revealed . in this respect , and accounting for the differences in methods , the pseudogap - fermi liquid transition reported for @xmath0 larger that the mott endpoint in ref .   as well as the crossover observed at large doping in refs .",

    "the same argument holds to disfavor the hypothesis of a tricritical point at some @xmath0 in the phase diagram .",
    "several earlier studies have also shown that the strong orbital differentiation phenomenon is a robust feature of cluster dmft solutions of the two - dimensional hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "but it was unclear what is the origin of the strong momentum differentiation and of its disappearance with doping .",
    "this phenomenon finds a natural explanation in our phase diagram since it marks the end of the ud phase .",
    "even if more investigations should be done to clarify both the crossover behavior above @xmath73 and the zero temperature limit of our phase diagram , our study reveals that a first - order transition inhabits and controls much of the physics of the normal - state phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "we now turn to the relevance of our results for the physics of the copper oxide superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the difficulties to achieve a unified picture are both experimental and theoretical . from the theory side , they arise mainly because the phase diagram of the cuprates defies three paradigms of condensed matter physics : band theory fails to explain the mott insulator at zero doping , bardeen - cooper - schrieffer description does not describe the unusual superconductivity and the landau fermi liquid theory does not capture the metal above @xmath137 and the pseudogap phase close to the mott insulator .",
    "therefore , understanding the evolution of these systems as a function of doping remains a challenging issue .",

    "we mention that in this context the optical lattices of cold atoms have opened up new perspectives to test these assumptions  @xcite and determine the phase diagram of basic hamiltonians of condensed matter physics  @xcite    from a methodological viewpoint , dynamical mean - field theory approaches allow to follow different phases as a function of model parameters . in this paper we concentrated on the normal state , by studying the cellular dmft paramagnetic solution of the two - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "thus the main experimental relevance of our work consists in elucidating how the proximity to the mott insulator affects the normal state .",
    "our key finding , namely the first - order transition between two metals , suggests the conjecture that the quantum critical behavior surmised in high - temperature superconductors @xcite originates from a constant @xmath0 cut of the finite - doping critical line ending the first - order surface between two types of metals .",
    "that transition occurs only when @xmath0 is larger than the critical value @xmath61 for the mott transition and moves to progressively higher doping as @xmath0 increases , reaching @xmath235 at @xmath236 , which corresponds to the doping that maximizes the superconducting transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that our first - order transition lies deep below the superconducting dome ( cf .",
    "refs .  ) .",
    "in addition , at large @xmath0 the critical point @xmath73 is at extremely low temperature and the smaller @xmath73 the farther its influence , in the form of large scattering rate , extends at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "our contribution is to pin down the large scattering rate to the influence of the mott phenomenon far away from half filling : the first - order transition is the source of anomalous scattering , which displays a funnel shape with increasing temperature .",
    "such funnel shape scattering separates underdoped from overdoped phases above the maximum of the superconducting dome in high temperature superconductors .",
    "therefore the ud and od phases , that we defined with respect to our metal - metal first order transition , should also correspond to the underdoped and overdoped regions normally defined in high temperature superconductors .",
    "given the differences in methods , the crossover that we found between ud and od phases is also the one detected for @xmath237 in refs .  .",
    "further work is planned to make the correspondence clearer , but at present at the qualitative level several of our results are similar to those found in experiment .",
    "first , anomalous scattering takes place near a critical doping .",
    "contrary to other approaches  @xcite , the source of this scattering is not a quantum critical point between two ordered phases , nor the proximity to an ordered phase , but a finite temperature crossover at finite doping coming from mott physics at work far from half filling .",
    "second , above the critical point , the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath238 vanishes and equivalently , the entropy has an extremum @xmath239 @xcite . using the kelvin formula @xcite",
    ", this suggests that the thermopower changes sign at finite doping  @xcite , consistent experiment @xcite . finally , as observed in the pseudogap phase @xcite ,",
    "there is a strong decrease with temperature of the spin susceptibility in our underdoped phase .",
    "the complete normal - state phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model as a function of temperature , doping and interaction strength reveals a surface of first - order transition that ends on a critical line and that can separate two different types of metals . that transition at finite doping between the underdoped and overdoped phase is unexpectedly connected to mott physics , since it originates at the half - filled mott endpoint and moves progressively away from half - filling as the interaction strength increases .",
    "the critical line rapidly moves to low temperature as interaction strength is increased beyond the critical value for the mott transition , and it leaves finite - temperature signatures similar to those that have suggested the existence of a quantum critical point near optimal doping in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "hence we propose that mott physics leads to a very low temperature critical point separating two metals and that this can be the source of anomalous normal state behavior near optimal doping in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "even though this critical point can not be accessed because of intervening long - range order , it controls the physics at sufficiently high temperature in the same way that a zero - temperature fermi - liquid ground state controls the normal state fermi liquid despite the fact that the true ground state may have long - range order .",
    "our proposal is clearly in its infancy and further work , already in progress , should reveal the precise nature of the criticality along with the relationship between the pseudogap phase and the ud region of our phase diagram .",
    "in addition , the study of some ordered states , like the antiferromagnetic and superconducting ones , should provide useful insight to complete the cellular dmft picture of the mott transition .",
    "nevertheless , our discovery sheds new light on the phase diagram of the 2d hubbard model and highlights that mott physics can play a pivotal role even far away from half filling .",
