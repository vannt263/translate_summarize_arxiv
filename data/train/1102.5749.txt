    "for @xmath2-dimensional hypersurfaces in euclidean space , it is natural to understand the relations between the intrinsic curvature and the extrinsic curvature . in 1897 , hadamard  @xcite proved that a closed ( i.e. , compact without boundary ) surface embedded in @xmath3 of positive gaussian curvature is a convex surface .",
    "hadamard s result was extended by stoker  @xcite to the complete non - compact case .",

    ". the further study of convex hypersurfaces can be found in , for example , h. wu  @xcite and the references therein .    among various notions of the intrinsic curvature ,",
    "the sectional curvature is the strongest ( pointwise ) curvature condition , while the scalar curvature is the weakest . in this paper",
    ", we consider the condition only on the scalar curvature without imposing any condition on the sectional curvature .",
    "we would like to know what kind of convexity can be implied by the nonnegative scalar curvature .",
    "our another motivation comes from the study of the @xmath0-th mean curvature . for an @xmath2-dimensional hypersurface , its @xmath0-th mean",
    "curvature ( @xmath5 ) , denoted by @xmath6 , is defined to be the @xmath0-th symmetric polynomial of its principal curvatures .",
    "it is known that @xmath7 is intrinsically defined , while @xmath8 is not , for each @xmath0 ( see  @xcite , for example ) . in particular",

    "* proof of proposition 3.3 ) and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath14 , the result follows from the gauss equation . a conjecture proposed by huisken and sinestrari  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) asks whether the analogous result holds when one replaces the condition @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "however , this conjecture turns out not true , for all @xmath17 .",
    "we construct in section  [ se : example ] a family of examples with @xmath16 but @xmath18 somewhere , for @xmath17 .",
    "these examples are inspired by chern ",
    "lashof  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the counter - examples for all @xmath19 , the conjecture holds for @xmath20 .",

    "the main analytic difficulty is that several natural geometric differential equations , including the linearized scalar curvature equation and scalar curvature flow , may be fully degenerate at points of vanishing mean curvature and cease to be globally elliptic .",
    "a new ingredient in the proof of theorem  [ thm : r ] is that we consider the level sets of the height function on the hypersurface .",
    "we derive a geometric inequality which relates the mean curvature and scalar curvature of @xmath22 to the mean curvature of the level sets ( see theorem [ th : hhr ] ) .",
    "therefore , the geometry of @xmath22 has some quantitative influence on the geometry of its level sets .",
    "this inequality is rather general and holds at each point .",
    "we then carefully investigate the geometry of the level sets , and establish a key lemma ( lemma  [ le : hsign ] ) .",

    "( we refer readers to the excellent survey by brendle  @xcite and the references therein , for the recent rigidity results involving scalar curvature . )    for a general non - closed hypersurface with nonnegative scalar curvature , the mean curvature may change signs locally .",

    "theorem  [ thm : r ] implies that the piece of hypersurface can not be extended to a closed hypersurface with nonnegative scalar curvature .    by extending the argument in the proof of theorem  [ th : unbounded ] , we generalize theorem [ thm : r ] to complete non - compact hypersurfaces of finitely many regular ends ( see definition  [ de : waf ] ) .",

    "see bray  @xcite for a thorough and up - to - date survey article on riemannian positive mass theorem .",
