    "galam s bottom - up hierarchical system and public debate model @xcite are used to understand voting behaviors of two competing opinions in democratic societies . in his models",
    ", galam assumes that initially individuals in the population are independently in favor of one opinion with a fixed probability , making the initial number of that type of opinion a binomial random variable .",
    "this analysis revisits galam s models by assuming that the initial number of individuals in favor of an opinion is a fixed deterministic number , which is more realistic when analyzing small populations .",
    "this paper is also concerned with a spatial version of galam s public debate model introduced in @xcite . before stating our results , we start with a detailed description of these three models .    * bottom - up hierarchical system *  the bottom - up hierarchical system @xcite is a stochastic process that depends on two parameters : the group size  @xmath2 and the number of voting steps  @xmath4 , which are both positive integers .",
    "the structure of this model , which is displayed in figure [ fig : voting - model ] , begins with a population of  @xmath5 individuals in favor of either opinion  @xmath1 or opinion  @xmath0 on the bottom level .",
    "this population is further divided into groups of size @xmath2 and local majority rules determine a representative candidate of each group who then ascends to another group at the next lowest level .",
    "this process continues until a single winner at level 0 is elected .",
    "when the group size @xmath2 is odd , majority rule is well defined , whereas when the group size @xmath2 is even , a bias is introduced favoring a predetermined type , say opinion  @xmath0 , if there is a tie .",
    "that is , the representative candidates are determined at each step according to the majority rule whenever there is a strict majority but is chosen to be the one in favor of opinion  @xmath0 in case of a tie .",
    "this assumption is justified by galam @xcite based on the principle of social inertia .",
    "more formally , one can think of the model as a rooted regular tree with degree @xmath2 and @xmath4 levels plus the root .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the opinion of the @xmath7th node / individual at level  @xmath8 .",
    "then , the opinion of each node is determined from the configuration of opinions @xmath9 at the bottom level and the recursive rule : @xmath10 note in particular that this recursive rule is deterministic making the process stochastic only through its configuration at the bottom level .",
    "galam @xcite assumes that nodes at the bottom level are independently in favor of a given opinion with a fixed probability .",
    "in contrast , we will assume that the configuration at the bottom level is a random permutation with a fixed number of nodes in favor of a given opinion .",
    "* non - spatial public debate model *  the second model under consideration in this paper is galam s public debate model that examines the dynamics of opinion shifts .",
    "this process again depends on the same two parameters but now evolves in time .",
    "there is a population of  @xmath4 individuals each with either opinion  @xmath1 or opinion  @xmath0 . at each time step , a random group of size  @xmath2 , called discussion group , is chosen from the population , which results in all the individuals in the group adopting the same opinion .",
    "the updating rule considered in @xcite is again the majority rule : if there are opposing opinions in the discussion group , then the opinion with the majority of supporters dominates the other opinion causing the individuals who initially supported the minority opinion to change their opinion to the majority opinion . as previously , when the group size  @xmath2 is even , ties may occur , in which case a bias is introduced in favor of opinion  @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to figure [ fig : debate - model ] for a schematic representation of this process . in this paper",
    ", we will also consider another natural updating rule that we shall call proportional rule , which assumed that all the individuals in the group adopt opinion  @xmath11 with a probability equal to the fraction of supporters of this opinion in the group before discussion . to define these processes more formally ,",
    "we now let @xmath12 be the opinion of individual @xmath7 at time @xmath8 . in both processes ,",
    "a set of @xmath2 individuals , say @xmath13 , is chosen uniformly from the population at each time step . under the majority rule",
    ", we set @xmath14 while under the proportional rule , we set @xmath15 in both processes , individuals outside @xmath13 are not affected by the discussion and the evolution rule is iterated until everyone in the population has the same opinion .",
    "we will see later that the process that keeps track of the number of individuals with opinion  @xmath1 rather than the actual configuration is itself a discrete - time markov chain . as for the bottom - up hierarchical system",
    ", we will assume that the configuration at time 0 has a fixed number of individuals in favor of a given opinion whereas galam studied the ( majority rule ) public debate model under the assumption that initially individuals are independently in favor of a given opinion with a fixed probability .",
    "* spatial public debate model *  the third model studied in this paper is a spatial version of the public debate model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the spatial structure is represented by the infinite @xmath3-dimensional regular lattice .",
    "each site of the lattice is occupied by one individual who is again characterized by their opinion : either opinion  @xmath1 or opinion  @xmath0 .",
    "the population being located on a geometrical structure , space can be included by assuming that only individuals in the same neighborhood can interact .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the set of discussion groups is @xmath16 since the number of discussion groups is infinite and countable , the statement `` choosing a group uniformly at random '' is no longer well defined .",
    "therefore , we define the process in continuous time using the framework of interacting particle systems assuming that discussion groups are updated independently at rate one , i.e. , at the arrival times of independent poisson processes with intensity one . the analysis in @xcite is concerned with the spatial model under the majority rule , whereas we focus on the proportional rule : all the individuals in the same discussion group adopt the same opinion with a probability equal to the fraction of supporters of this opinion in the group before discussion .",
    "formally , the state of the process at time @xmath17 is now a function @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the opinion at time @xmath17 of the individual located at site @xmath20 , and the dynamics of the process is described by the markov generator @xmath21 \\vspace*{-4pt } \\\\ & & \\hspace*{60pt } + \\",
    "\\displaystyle \\sum_x \\,\\sum_{z \\in b_s } \\,s^{-d } \\ { \\mathbf 1}\\{\\eta ( x + z ) = - 1 \\ } \\ [ f ( \\tau_x^- \\eta ) - f ( \\eta ) ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the operators defined on the set of configurations by @xmath24 the first part of the generator indicates that , for each @xmath20 , all the individuals in @xmath25 switch simultaneously to opinion  @xmath1 at rate the fraction of individuals with opinion  @xmath1 in the group .",
    "the second part gives similar transition rates for opinion  @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , basic properties of poisson processes imply that each group is indeed updated at rate one according to the proportional rule .",
    "note that the process no longer depends on @xmath4 since the population size is infinite but we will see that its behavior strongly depends on the spatial dimension @xmath3 .",
    "for the bottom - up hierarchical system and the non - spatial public debate model , the main problem is to determine the probability that a given opinion , say opinion  @xmath1 , wins , as a function of the density or number of individuals holding this opinion in the initial configuration . for the spatial public debate model , since the population is infinite , the time to reach a configuration in which all the individuals share the same opinion is almost surely infinite when starting from a configuration with infinitely many individuals of each type . in this case , the main problem is to determine whether opinions can coexist at equilibrium or not .    * galam s results *  galam studied the bottom - up hierarchical system and the non - spatial public debate model under the majority rule .",
    "as previously explained , the assumption in @xcite about the initial configuration of each model is that individuals are independently in favor of opinion  @xmath1 with some fixed probability . under this assumption ,",
    "the analysis is simplified because the probability of an individual being in favor of a given opinion at one level for the bottom - up hierarchical system or at one time step for the public debate model can be computed explicitly in a simple manner from its counterpart at the previous level or time step .",
    "more precisely , focusing on the bottom - up hierarchical system for concreteness , if @xmath26 is the common probability of any given individual being in favor of opinion  @xmath1 at level  @xmath8 then the sequence @xmath27 can be computed recursively as follows : @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the probability that a given opinion wins the election can then be computed explicitly . for both models , in the limit as the population size tends to infinity , the problem reduces to finding the fixed points of the polynomial @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 , @xmath32 therefore @xmath33 is a fixed point .",
    "it follows that , with probability close to one when the population size is large , the winning opinion is the one that has initially the largest frequency of representants , a result that easily extends to all odd sizes .",
    "the case of even sizes is more intriguing .",
    "when the group size @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 where the roots @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 this implies that , when the population is large , the probability that opinion  @xmath1 wins is near zero if the initial frequency of its representants is below @xmath39 .",
    "it can be proved that the same result holds for the non - spatial public debate model when the population size is large . because opinions are initially independent and of a given type with a fixed probability , the initial number of individuals with opinion  @xmath1 is a binomial random variable , and",
    "the main reason behind the simplicity of galam s results is that the dynamics of his models preserves this property : at any level / time , the number of individuals with opinion  @xmath1 is again binomial",
    ". the first objective of this paper is to revisit galam s results under the assumption that the initial number of individuals with opinion  @xmath1 is a fixed deterministic number rather than binomially distributed .",
    "this assumption is more realistic for small populations but the analysis is also more challenging because the number of individuals with a given opinion in non - overlapping groups are no longer independent . *",
    "bottom - up hierarchical system *  for the bottom - up hierarchical system , we start with a fixed deterministic number @xmath20 of individuals holding opinion  @xmath1 at the bottom level .",
    "the main objective is then to determine the winning probability @xmath40 where @xmath2 is the group size and @xmath4 is the number of voting steps . assuming that individuals holding the same opinion are identical , there are @xmath5 choose @xmath20 possible configurations at the bottom level of the system . to compute the probability ,",
    "the most natural approach is to compute the number of such configurations that result in the election of candidate @xmath1 .",
    "this problem , however , is quite challenging so we use instead a different strategy .",
    "the main idea is to count configurations which are compatible with the victory of @xmath1 going backwards in the hierarchy : we count the number of configurations at level one that result in the election of candidate @xmath1 , then the number of configurations at level two that result in any of these configurations at level one , and so on . to compute the number of such configurations , for each size - level pair @xmath41 , we set @xmath42 then , for all @xmath43 , define @xmath44 where the sum is over all @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and such that @xmath47 we will prove that the number of configurations with @xmath48 individuals holding opinion  @xmath1 at level  @xmath49 that result in a given configuration with @xmath20 individuals holding opinion  @xmath1 at level  @xmath8 is exactly given by .",
    "the fact that the evolution rules are deterministic also implies that different configurations at a given level can not result from the same configuration at a lower level .",
    "in particular , the number of configurations at the bottom level that result in the victory of opinion  @xmath1 can be deduced from a simple summation as in the proof of chapman - kolmogorov s equations in the theory of markov chains .",
    "more precisely , we have the following theorem .    ",
    "[ th : voting ] for all @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    the expression for the probability can not be simplified but for any fixed parameter it can be computed explicitly . in the case of groups of size @xmath31 , reduces to @xmath54 while in the case of groups of size @xmath34 , this reduces to @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig : voting ] shows the probabilities computed from  for different values of the number of levels and group size along with the corresponding probabilities under galam s assumption .",
    "the figure reveals that the phase transition is sharper when starting from a fixed number rather than a binomially distributed number of individuals holding a given opinion .",
    "this aspect is more pronounced when the population size is small .",
    "* non - spatial public debate model *  for the non - spatial public debate model , our main objective is again to determine the winning probability when starting from a fixed number of individuals holding opinion  @xmath1 .",
    "since at each time step all the individuals are equally likely to be part of the chosen discussion group , the actual label on each individual is unimportant . in particular",
    ", we shall simply define @xmath57 as the number of individuals with opinion  @xmath1 at time @xmath8 rather than the vector of opinions . with this new definition",
    "the winning probability can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath2 is the group size and @xmath4 is the total number of individuals .",
    "we start with the model under the majority rule . in this case",
    ", we have the following result .    ",
    "[ th : debate - majority ] under the majority rule , @xmath59 in addition , there exists @xmath60 such that , for all @xmath61 , @xmath62    note that the first probability in the theorem can be re - written as @xmath63 unfortunately , we do not know why the winning probability has this simple combinatorial interpretation but this is what follows from our calculation which is based on a first - step analysis , a standard technique in the theory of markov chains .",
    "this technique can also be used to determine the winning probabilities for larger @xmath2 recursively , which is how the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : debate-34 ] is obtained , but for @xmath64 the algebra becomes too complicated to get an explicit formula .",
    "interestingly , the second part of the theorem shows that the critical threshold @xmath39 obtained under galam s assumption appears again under our assumption on the initial configuration , though it comes from a different calculation .",
    "this result follows partly from an application of the optimal stopping theorem for supermartingales .",
    "turning to the non - spatial public debate model under the proportional rule , first - step analysis is again problematic when the group size exceeds three .",
    "nevertheless , the winning probabilities can be computed explicitly .",
    " [ th : debate - proportional ] under the proportional rule , @xmath65    in words , under the proportional rule , the probability that opinion  @xmath1 wins is simply equal to the initial fraction of individuals holding this opinion . as for the second part of theorem [ th : debate - majority ]",
    ", the proof of this result relies in part on an application of the optimal stopping theorem .    * spatial public debate model *  contrary to the non - spatial public debate model , for the spatial version starting with a finite number of individuals with opinion  @xmath1",
    ", the number of such individuals does not evolve according to a markov chain because the actual location of these individuals matters .",
    "however , under the proportional rule , the auxiliary process that keeps track of the number of individuals with opinion @xmath1 is a martingale with respect to the natural filtration of the spatial model .",
    "since it is also integer - valued and the population is infinite , it follows from the martingale convergence theorem that opinion  @xmath1 dies out with probability one .",
    "therefore , to avoid trivialities , we return to galam s assumption for the spatial model : we assume that individuals independently support opinion  @xmath1 with probability @xmath66 . since the population is infinite , both opinions are present at any time , and the main objective is now to determine whether they can coexist at equilibrium .",
    "the answer depends on the spatial dimension @xmath3 , as for the voter model @xcite .     [ th : spatial - debate ] under the proportional rule ,    * the system clusters in @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 * both opinions coexist in @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 converges in distribution to an invariant measure in which there is a positive density of both opinions .",
    "the proof relies on a certain duality relationship between the spatial model and coalescing random walks , just as for the voter model , though this relationship is somewhat hidden in the case of the public debate model . before proving our theorems ,",
    "we point out that the spatial public debate model under the majority rule has also been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "there , it is proved that the one - dimensional process clusters when the group size @xmath2 is odd whereas opinion  @xmath0 invades the lattice and outcompetes the other opinion when the group size is even .",
    "it is also proved based on a rescaling argument that opinion  @xmath0 wins in two dimensions when @xmath71 .",
    "the main objective is to count the number of configurations at level  @xmath4 with @xmath20 individuals with opinion  @xmath1 that will deterministically result in the election of type  @xmath1 president after @xmath4 consecutive voting steps . even though the evolution rules of the voting system are deterministic ( recall that the model is only stochastic through its random initial configuration ) , our approach is somewhat reminiscent of the theory of markov chains .",
    "the idea is to reverse time by thinking of the type of the president at level zero as the initial state , and more generally the configuration at level  @xmath8 as the state at time @xmath8 . in the theory of discrete - time markov chains ,",
    "the distribution at time @xmath8 given the initial state can be computed by looking at the @xmath8th power of the transition matrix , which keeps track of the probabilities of all possible sample paths that connect two particular states in @xmath8 time steps . to this extend",
    ", the right - hand side of can be seen as the analog of the @xmath8th power of a transition matrix , or chapman - kolmogorov s equation , with however two exceptions .",
    "first , the expression is more complicated because the number of individuals per level is not constant and therefore the evolution rules are not homogeneous in time .",
    "second , and more importantly , the transition probability from @xmath72 at time @xmath8 is replaced by an integer , namely @xmath73 by thinking of the bottom - up hierarchical system going backwards in time , the question becomes : how many configurations with @xmath20 individuals of type  @xmath1 at time / level  @xmath4 result from the initial configuration + 1 at time / level zero , which corresponds to the victory of type  @xmath1 president . to make the argument rigorous and",

    "in addition , @xmath200 noticing that opinion + 1 wins only if @xmath201 and combining  , we get @xmath202 for all @xmath199 and all @xmath4 sufficiently large .    ",

",
    "[ lem : debate - proportional ] under the proportional rule , we have @xmath214 .",
    "since an update can only result in an increase of the number of + 1 individuals by @xmath122 if the discussion group selected has exactly @xmath215 individuals in favor of + 1 , we have @xmath216 for all @xmath217 .",
    "similarly , @xmath218 for all @xmath219 .",
    "now , let @xmath220 and observe that @xmath221 this shows that @xmath222 for all @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , using the transformation @xmath223 and recalling the expression of the two conditional probabilities  , we obtain @xmath224 which gives the conditional expectation @xmath225 this shows that the process @xmath226 is a martingale .",
    "now , let @xmath227 and observe that the stopping time @xmath228 is almost surely finite .",
    "since in addition the process is bounded , an application of the optimal stopping theorem implies that @xmath229 from which it follows that @xmath230 .",
    "to conclude , we study the spatial version of the public debate model introduced in @xcite but replacing the majority rule with the proportional rule . the key to our analysis is similar to the approach used in previous works @xcite about the voter model .",
    "the idea is to construct the process from a so - called harris graphical representation and then use the resulting graphical structure to exhibit a relationship between the process and a system of coalescing random walks .    * graphical representations *  we first give a possible graphical representation from which the spatial public debate model can be constructed starting from any initial configuration . though natural , this graphical representation does not allow to derive a useful duality relationship between the process and coalescing random walks .",
    "we then introduce an alternative way to construct the process leading to such a duality relationship .",
    "recall that @xmath231 represents the collection of discussion groups .",
    "each of these groups is updated in continuous time at rate one , i.e. , at the arrival times of independent poisson processes with intensity one .",
    "in addition , since the new opinion of the group after an update is chosen to be + 1 with probability the fraction of + 1 individuals in the group just before the update , the new opinion can be determined by comparing the fraction of + 1 with a uniform random variable over the unit interval .",
    "in particular , a natural way to construct the spatial public debate model graphically is to      for all @xmath235 and @xmath236 . at time",
    "@xmath237 , all the individuals in @xmath25 are simultaneously updated as a result of a discussion and we set @xmath238 while the configuration outside @xmath25 stays unchanged .",
    "an idea of harris @xcite implies that the process starting from any initial configuration can be constructed using this rule .",
    "we now construct another process @xmath239 with the same state space as follows : the times at which individuals in the same discussion group interact are defined as above from the same collection of independent poisson processes , but to determine the outcome of the discussion we now      for all @xmath235 and @xmath236 . at time",
    "@xmath237 , all the individuals in @xmath25 are simultaneously updated as a result of a discussion and we set @xmath241 while the configuration outside @xmath25 stays unchanged .",
    "the next lemma , whose proof is simply based on a re - writing of events under consideration , shows that both rules  define in fact the same process : the processes @xmath242 and @xmath239 are stochastically equal .",
    "* duality with coalescing random walks *  the duality relationship between the voter model and coalescing random walks results from keeping track of the ancestors of different space - time points going backwards in time through the graphical representation . in the case of the public debate model @xmath247 , the opinion of an individual just after an interaction depends on the opinion of all the individuals in the corresponding discussion group just before the interaction .",
    "therefore , to define the set of ancestors of a given space - time point , we draw an arrow @xmath248 to indicate that the opinion at @xmath249 depends on the opinion at @xmath250 , and say that there is a @xmath251-path connecting two space - time points , which we write @xmath252 whenever there are sequences of times and spatial locations @xmath253 such that there is an arrow @xmath254 the set of ancestors of @xmath255 at time @xmath256 is then encoded in the set - valued process @xmath257 note that the opinion at @xmath255 can be deduced from the graphical representation of @xmath247 and the initial opinion at sites that belong to @xmath258 . note also that the process grows linearly going backwards in time , i.e. , increasing @xmath2 .",
    "see the left - hand side of figure [ fig : dual ] for a picture .",
    "this makes the process @xmath247 mathematically intractable to prove clustering and coexistence . to establish the connection between the spatial process and coalescing random walks",
    ", we use instead the other , mathematically equivalent , version @xmath259 of the spatial public debate model . for this version , the opinion of an individual just after an interaction depends on the opinion of only one individual in the corresponding discussion group just before the interaction .",
    "the location of this individual is given by the value of the uniform @xmath260 random variables .",
    "therefore , to define the set of ancestors of a given space - time point , we now draw an arrow @xmath261 to indicate that the opinion at @xmath262 depends on the opinion at @xmath263 .",
    "we then define @xmath264-paths , which we now write @xmath265 , as previously but using this new random set of arrows .",

    "note that is reduced to a singleton for all times @xmath270 and that we have the duality relationship @xmath271 where @xmath272 . in the next lemma",
    ", we prove that @xmath273 is a symmetric random walk , which makes the dual process itself a system of coalescing symmetric random walks with one walk starting from each site in the finite set @xmath274 .      by construction of the dual process ,",
    "for @xmath275 , @xmath276 since in addition discussion groups are updated at rate one and @xmath277 we obtain the following transition rates : @xmath278 in addition , since for all @xmath279 the translation operator @xmath280 is a one - to - one correspondence from the set of discussion groups to itself and since @xmath281 we have the equality @xmath282 combining  , we conclude that @xmath283 for all @xmath284 , which completes the proof .",
    "+   + in fact , some basic geometry shows that @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the @xmath122th coordinate of the vector @xmath287 . with lemma [ lem : equivalent ] , which shows that @xmath259 is indeed the spatial public debate model , and the previous lemma in hands",
    ", the rest of the proof of the theorem follows the lines of the corresponding result for the voter model @xcite .",
    "since it is short , we briefly recall the main ideas in the next two lemmas that deal with the clustering part and the coexistence part of the theorem , respectively .",
    "since @xmath273 and @xmath289 evolve according to independent random walks run at rate one until they coalesce , the difference between the random walks @xmath290 is a continuous - time symmetric random walk run at rate two absorbed at site zero .",
    "since this random walk has in addition a finite range of interactions , it is recurrent in one and two dimensions , hence @xmath291 by the duality relationship , we conclude that @xmath292 this completes the proof .",
    "to prove convergence to a stationary distribution , we first observe that there is no + 1 individual in the set @xmath274 at time @xmath17 if and only if there is no + 1 individual in the corresponding dual process at time 0 .",
    "in particular , identifying @xmath293 with the set of + 1 individuals , we get @xmath294 the dominated convergence theorem implies that both terms in have a limit as time goes to infinity , which proves the existence of a stationary distribution .",
    "moreover , using again the duality relationship and the fact that symmetric simple random walks are transient in three or higher dimensions , we obtain the positivity of the limit @xmath295 this shows that the spatial public debate model converges to a stationary distribution in which the density of + 1 individuals and the density of @xmath0 individuals are both positive ."
