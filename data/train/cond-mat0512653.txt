    "the arsenic atoms become electrically active , occupying the substitutional positions .",
    "then a fraction of impurity atoms incorporates into the clusters , thereby decreasing the layer conductivity .",
    "@xcite due to clustering , the concentration of charge carriers is less than the total impurity concentration because the clustered dopant atoms do not serve as a source of free charge carriers .",
    "we can observe the clustering phenomenon in many cases of the formation of highly doped semiconductor structures ; for example , in the region with high impurity concentration during thermal diffusion of arsenic atoms.@xcite deactivation of the electrically active dopant atoms also indicates that clustering can occur during thermal treatment of the supersaturated arsenic layers created by ion implantation with subsequent thermal or laser annealing .",
    "@xcite moreover , a reverse annealing or transient increase of the carrier density can be observed if a doped specimen , previously annealed at temperature @xmath9 , is further annealed at higher temperature @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite it is supposed that transient dissolution of a part of the clusters occurs during such a reverse annealing .",
    "@xcite    at very high dopant concentrations exceeding the solid solubility of as in si , a significant fraction of arsenic atoms can form precipitates .",
    "@xcite the typical distributions of the total dopant concentration and electron density after thermal annealing of silicon substrates heavily implanted by as were presented by nobili et al .",
    "@xcite ( fig . 7 ) and by solmi @xcite ( fig .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "1c , @xcite the carrier concentration reaches its saturation value @xmath11 @xmath12m@xmath13 , whereas the total arsenic concentration increases to the solubility limit @xmath14 @xmath12m@xmath15 @xcite and continues to increase in the region adjoint to the surface .",
    "it is supposed that the cluster formation occurs at high dopant concentrations , @xcite more precisely , at the dopant concentrations approximately ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "if dopant concentration exceeds the solubility limit @xmath18 , precipitation occurs .",
    "@xcite arsenic clustering and precipitation have attracted evergrowing attention of the researchers , as they are greatly important for the silicon integrated circuits technology . both clusters and",
    "precipitates do not serve as a source of charge carriers and the total arsenic concentration may be higher than the electron density by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the clusters and precipitates are metastable and can dissociate under subsequent thermal treatments .",
    "this means that stringent requirements should be placed upon the accuracy of the clustering models used to calculate the carrier concentrations in heavily doped silicon layers .",
    "the development of a model for as clustering necessitates a consistent analysis of the experimental data and theoretical substantiation of the processes proceeding in heavily doped silicon layers .",
    "a great number of clustering models with different types of clusters have been developed and proposed since 1973 .",
    "@xcite the variety of the proposed models reflects discrepancies in the experimental results @xcite and a great uncertainty in the nature of the clusters discussed .",
    "for example , inactive cluster @xmath19 was considered in @xcite to explain the difference between the total and electrically active dopant concentrations for arsenic thermally diffused from a constant source . for the best fit to the diffusion profiles of ion - implanted arsenic",
    ", it was suggested that the electrically inactive arsenic atoms were incorporated into the clusters with four arsenic atoms per cluster .",
    "@xcite according to tsai et al .",
    "@xcite who have also investigated diffusion in the ion - implanted layers , clustering of arsenic may be expressed as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the substitutionally dissolved arsenic atom participating in the cluster formation ; @xmath22 is the electron .    as follows from reaction ( [ cluster_reaction_tsai ] ) ,",
    "the clustered as atoms are electrically active at annealing temperatures , but are neutral at room temperature .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the formation of clusters @xmath23 occurs due to the following reaction , which    @xmath24    is most liable to cause deactivation because the concentration of inactive as species increases to the fourth power of the active as concentration .",
    "@xcite here @xmath25 is the doubly negatively charged vacancy participating in the clustering .",
    "indeed , if a local equilibrium is assumed , it follows from the mass action law for reaction ( [ cluster_reaction_uematsu ] ) that    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the concentrations of the impurity atoms incorporated into clusters and substitutionally dissolved arsenic atoms , respectively ; @xmath31 is the constant of the local equilibrium for reaction ( [ cluster_reaction_uematsu ] ) ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the actual and the equilibrium concentrations of neutral vacancies , respectively ; @xmath34 is the electron density normalized to the concentration of intrinsic charge carriers in a semiconductor during thermal treatment @xmath35 .",
    "one would expect from ( [ mal_uematsu ] ) that reaction ( [ cluster_reaction_uematsu ] ) yields the fourth power dependence @xmath36 , since for high concentrations @xmath37 it might be reasonable to assume @xmath38 .",
    "however , as seen from fig .",
    "@xcite ) and fig . 1c ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the electron density @xmath39 in the region of concentrations associated with active clustering . consequently ,",
    "reaction ( [ cluster_reaction_uematsu ] ) yields the second power dependence @xmath40 , which contradicts the experimental data .",
    "@xcite    because of the vacancy participating in cluster formation , silicon self - interstitials were in turn ejected or left behind during clustering .",
    "@xcite this assumption had been made much earlier in the study @xcite of impurity deactivation within the laser - annealed layers .",
    "however , the results obtained in @xcite show that the point defects induced during clustering and/or precipitation make no contribution to the enhanced transient diffusion of arsenic implanted at low energy , while these defects did coalesce to form extended defects at the projected range .",
    "analysis of the defect microstructure has revealed that the transition between arsenic clustering and sias precipitation is not abrupt , pointing to possible coexistence of arsenic clusters and sias precipitates ( although precipitates are not directly observed ) .",
    "@xcite    the model @xcite was generalized by solmi and nobili @xcite    @xmath41    to take into account a saturation behavior of the carrier density with increasing dopant concentration . for diffusion at a temperature of 1050@xmath0c , the best agreement between the modeled and experimental curves describing diffusivity against total arsenic concentration was achieved for @xmath42 .",
    "and at 900@xmath0c , the neutral cluster model @xcite provided a better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the reaction ( [ cluster_reaction_solmi ] ) was also used in @xcite to describe deactivation in the arsenic - doped layers , which were formed by ion implantation and high temperature annealing of silicon - on - insulator specimens .",
    "however , solmi et al .",
    "@xcite have recently used the following reaction    @xmath43    to model the transient arsenic diffusion . here",
    "@xmath44 is assumed to have the values between 2 and 4 to take into account the fact that the as cluster was formed around a vacancy with the subsequent injection of the self - interstitial .",
    "it is important to note that reaction ( [ cluster_reaction_solmi ] ) was first theoretically studied by guerrero et al . in paper , @xcite which will be considered below .",
    "let us consider the clustering models used for the explanation of deactivation in the supersaturated arsenic layers formed by ion implantation and subsequent laser annealing .",
    "in @xcite it was found that a cluster consisting of four positively charged arsenic atoms and two additional negative charges gave the best least - squares fit with respect to the experimental data obtained in the case of deactivation within the supersaturated arsenic layers created by ion implantation and subsequent laser annealing . if two negative charges are associated with a doubly charged vacancy , this model gains support from the theoretical calculations of pandey et al .",
    "@xcite such a cluster has an intuitive geometrical and structural appeal  four arsenic atoms tetrahedrally arranged around a vacancy may relax inward , thus relieving lattice strains due to the as size effect .",
    "@xcite using this cluster species , a single - step clustering reaction was postulated in @xcite    @xmath45    the assumption of self - interstitial ejection during clustering was supported by the experimental data obtained by parisini et al .",
    "@xcite who have observed that extended defects at the projected range were extrinsic or interstitial in nature .",
    "the reaction    @xmath46    was proposed in @xcite only for the initial step of the deactivation process in arsenic implanted silicon specimens , first laser - annealed and then thermally annealed . here",
    "@xmath47 is the negatively charged self - interstitial .",
    "the results obtained by rousseau et al . @xcite",
    "confirm the conclusion that arsenic is indeed deactivated by vacancies , with a concurrent injection of self - interstitials .",
    "the latter follows from the observed significant enhancement of the diffusion in the buried boron layer underneath the as structure subjected to deactivation .",
    "investigations of the enhanced diffusion in buried boron layers were continued in , @xcite where it was proposed that small arsenic clusters of various sizes were formed around a vacancy during deactivation with injection of the associated interstitial into the bulk .",
    "considering that the majority of the models described in this section are based essentially on the experimental investigations of the defect subsystem , we first concern ourselves with these experimental results .",
    "the methods of transmission electron spectroscopy ( tem ) , @xcite extended x - ray - absorption fine - structure ( exafs ) , @xcite rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) , @xcite positron lifetime measurements @xcite combined with the measurements of electron momentum distributions , @xcite and other methods @xcite are commonly used to investigate silicon specimens doped by as .",
    "for example , tem observations show that as - lased samples are completely free of any visible defects .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , tem analysis reveals the presence of extended defects after subsequent thermal treatment .",
    "@xcite for example , small \\{113 } interstitial loops begin to appear beyond the plateau region of the as profile after low - temperature treatment .",
    "@xcite after high - temperature thermal treatment ( @xmath48850@xmath0c ) , a low density of very small as - related precipitates ( about 2 nm in diameter ) is observed .",
    "the precipitated as fraction can not be responsible for the total amount of inactive as .",
    "@xcite    it was established that exafs measurements provided particular details about the local atomic structure around the dopant and confirmed the fact that as atoms are substitutional after laser annealing .",
    "@xcite note that , according to the x - ray standing - wave spectroscopy measurements , the as atoms remained at the substitutional positions even after 85% of the electrical activity has been lost due to thermal annealing of the laser melted layers .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , a large amount of nonsubstitutional arsenic was detected by rutherford back - scattering after diffusion from @xmath49 source .",
    "@xcite these defects are interpreted as precipitates , probably formed due to the stress induced by @xmath49 layer . indeed , when thermal annealing is carried out after the complete removal of titanium silicide ( i.e. , without stress )",
    ", one can observe the activation of all the arsenic atoms diffused in the silicon substrate .",
    "@xcite thus , such full activation indicates the significant influence of stress on the formation of precipitates .",
    "according to exafs measurements , @xcite subsequent thermal annealing ( 350750@xmath50c ) of the as - lased layers leads to the formation of @xmath51 clusters including up to @xmath52 as atoms around the vacancy .",
    "however , at high temperatures it was observed that the number of the first neighbors of si has tended back to 4 atoms .",
    "this is probably due to the precipitates observed by tem over this temperature range .",
    "quantitative analysis of exafs data for the ultra - low energy implanted layers after rapid or spike annealing @xcite has revealed a site for as that was different from the pure substitutional one , suggesting the presence of clusters of as atoms coupled to vacancies .",
    "all the observed phenomena , namely , a low value of the total coordination number in the annealed samples , small @xmath53 bond length , and the presence of @xmath54 coordinations , may be explained by the assumption that clustering of as ions with vacancies takes place to form @xmath55 structures .    ion channeling and rbs were used in @xcite to complement the exafs and electron microscopy results .",
    "in has been found that the deactivated as atom is displaced with respect to the lattice sites and , moreover , the average displacement is constant over the temperature range 450900@xmath0c , being equal to @xmath56  . also , in @xcite it was proposed that the formation of larger clusters @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) occurred starting from @xmath19 or @xmath60 .",
    "the formation of these larger clusters is in agreement with a decrease in the first nearest neighbors of as . at higher temperatures , an increase in the number of the first nearest neighbors of as to 4",
    "was observed by exafs measurements .",
    "@xcite this means that the cluster species may differ at intermediate ( 350750@xmath0c ) and higher temperatures .",
    "very interesting information about clustering was obtained during the experimental investigations of the doped layers by positron annihilation spectroscopy @xcite and by positron annihilation spectroscopy combined with the hall - effect / resistivity measurements .",
    "@xcite the defect subsystem was generally investigated before and after thermal treatment . to support these measurements ,",

    "@xcite have studied the silicon layers ( with arsenic concentration 4@xmath62 @xmath63 ) fully activated by laser melting and subsequently annealed for 15 s at 500 and 750@xmath0c .",
    "the changes in the positron annihilation spectra after the thermal treatment at 500 or 750@xmath0c were also attributed to the formation of @xmath64 complexes . in this experiment ,",
    "the impossibility of determining the number of impurity atoms incorporated in the impurity - vacancy complex was established .",
    "ranki at al .",

    "@xcite have concluded that the dominant defect in as - grown samples was @xmath66 .",
    "the measurements demonstrated high concentrations ( above @xmath67 @xmath68 ) of @xmath66 complexes in heavily - doped silicon .",
    "moreover , larger v - as complexes , probably @xmath69 , may occur together with @xmath66 at high as concentrations . a relative amount of @xmath69 increases with annealing .",
    "this cluster is even dominant after annealing at 800@xmath0c .",

    "@xcite for example , positron experiments @xcite were performed both with the as - grown samples doped by arsenic in concentrations of @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73 and samples subjected to 2 mev electron irradiation at 300 k. it was established that heavily as - doped silicon contained @xmath66 complex as a native defect . before irradiation , the concentration of @xmath66 was equal to @xmath74 @xmath73 at a doping level of @xmath72 @xmath73 . after electron irradiation",
    ", one can observe the pairs ( @xmath70 ) formed by a vacancy and a single impurity atom .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the migration of these @xmath70 defects started at around 450 k , leading to formation of @xmath19 defects . and",
    ", in turn , these defects were transformed to @xmath66 defects at 700 k. the @xmath66 defects were stable at 700 k , representing the dominant vacancy - impurity cluster in heavily doped n - type si at this temperature .",
    "the formation of larger @xmath19 and @xmath66 complexes was significantly dependent on the as concentration .",
    "this interpretation of the experimental data was confirmed by the results obtained in .",
    "@xcite in these experiments , the electron irradiated samples were annealed isochronally ( 30 min ) at 3001220 k. irradiation of the heavily doped si samples has produced mainly the vacancy - donor pairs ( @xmath70 ) with a small concentration of divacancies . considering that , after irradiation ,",
    "@xmath70 concentration was much higher than the initial concentration of @xmath66 , no signals from @xmath66 were observed for the as - irradiated as - doped sample . from the core - region",
    "electron momentum distribution measurements , it was found @xcite that defects in as - irradiated samples may be identified as @xmath70 , in samples annealed at 600 k  as @xmath19 , and in those annealed at 775 k  as @xmath66 . it is well known that a drastic drop in the conductivity occurs when heavily doped si is annealed at temperatures between 400@xmath0c and 500@xmath0c .",
    "this deactivation of the dopants is partially reversible by annealing at 8001000@xmath0c .",
    "taking into account these experimental data , ranki et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the formation and annealing of @xmath66 at 700 and 1100 k , respectively , are responsible for the observed behavior of the conductivity .",
    "the experiments conducted in @xcite were completed by studies in @xcite associated with thermal treatment up to 1220 k. it has been found that dissociation of @xmath66 began at 1100 k , and at 1220 k these defects were annealed away .    thus , the analyzed data show that complexing of as atoms with vacancies occurs in the layers heavily doped by arsenic . based on the experimental data , various @xmath75 clusters are possible but @xmath19 and @xmath66 are the most likely . taking clustering into account",
    ", one can explain the phenomenon of compensation at high doping levels . nevertheless , some aspects are not clearly understood .",
    "for example , @xmath66 starts to dissociate at 1100 k. this annealing temperature agrees well with the observation that the number of si first neighbors tends back to 4 atoms @xcite at temperatures",
    "higher than 750@xmath0c . at the same time",
    ", clustering occurs at temperatures higher than 750@xmath0c as well .",
    "@xcite this means that such a high temperature clustering is hardly explained by @xmath66 complexes .",
    "along with various experimental investigations , a number of the theoretical _ ab initio _ calculations have been performed to explain deactivation of arsenic atoms in silicon . from the calculations of pandey",
    "et al . , @xcite it follows that @xmath60 complex including a vacancy surrounded by four arsenic atoms is energetically favored over both substitutional , isolated as in si and substitutional @xmath76 configurations .",
    "this cluster is electrically inactive , being responsible for arsenic deactivation and structural changes in heavily doped silicon .",
    "larger defect clusters ( e.g. , @xmath77 ) should also form during annealing , whereas @xmath60 is only the first step in the clustering process .",
    "these investigations were continued in , @xcite where general @xmath57 complexes have been considered .",
    "the formation energies of the vacancy - donor complexes @xmath70 , @xmath19 , @xmath66 , and @xmath60 were found to be 2.47 , 0.82 , -0.53 , and -2.39 ev , respectively .",
    "moreover , it was proposed that the complex @xmath19 was mobile , as were the @xmath70 pairs . as these pairs moved , they reacted with other defects to form larger , immobile complexes . when considering the mobile @xmath19 complexes , ramamoorthy and",
    "pantelides @xcite have tried to explain the coupled diffusion phenomenona and clustering .",
    "it was supposed that @xmath19 and @xmath66 were the dominant complexes in the deactivated specimens near the enhanced - diffusion threshold .",
    "@xcite a high rate of as diffusion observed during rapid thermal annealing @xcite was due to @xmath19 migration over a very short time period ( 6 - 60 s ) , when no extensive clustering could occur . during their motion ,",
    "@xmath19 complexes reacted with other defects and formed larger , immobile complexes , which decreased the as diffusivity .",
    "nevertheless , further investigation is necessary because some theoretical results disagree with the experimental data .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was stated that the formation of @xmath66 or @xmath60 defects was exothermic , but , according to the first - principles calculations , @xcite buildup of @xmath70 or @xmath19 structures was endothermic .",
    "this means that even at low arsenic concentrations all impurity atoms must form @xmath66 or @xmath60 clusters after long - time treatment . in point of fact , at low dopant concentrations , one can observe intensive diffusion by means of @xmath70 pairs rather than clustering .    berding et al . ,",
    "@xcite and berding and sher @xcite have used the electronic quasichemical formalism to calculate a free energy of various clusters , including @xmath78 , @xmath60 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath78 is the arsenic atom in the substitutional position .",
    "the neutral cluster composed of threefold - coordinated second - neighbor arsenic atoms dp(2 ) was proposed by chadi et al .",
    "@xcite as an alternative to exothermic @xmath60 . the clusters dp(2 ) , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 were also included in the calculations performed in",
    "@xcite in contrast to , @xcite berding et al . , @xcite berding and sher @xcite take into account the ionized states and entropy of the cluster formation .",
    "the entropy is unfavourable for the formation of a large defect complex such as @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the complete free - energy calculation is needed to determine the role of @xmath60 in deactivation . based on the complete free - energy calculation , it was found that cluster @xmath60 was neutral , in agreement with the previous findings .",
    "@xcite also , the energy of this complex ( -1.62 ev ) was in a rough agreement with the value given in .",
    "@xcite the @xmath66 and @xmath19 clusters were found to have one and two acceptor levels within the energy gap .",
    "consequently , their formation energy may be effectively decreased when the fermi energy is near the conduction - band edge .",
    "the equilibrium cluster concentrations depending on the temperature and concentration of dopant atoms are obtained using the minimized free energy of the system .",
    "for all the dopant concentrations and temperatures considered ( 4001000@xmath0c ) , three classes of clusters are dominant under equilibrium conditions : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath60 . in all cases ,",
    "the fermi energy was near the conduction - band edge .",
    "predominantly , @xmath66 and @xmath19 were singly and doubly ionized , respectively . at low arsenic concentrations ( up to @xmath84 @xmath61@xmath85 ) , noticeable deactivation was absent for temperatures higher than 500@xmath0c .",
    "with the arsenic concentration raised to @xmath86 @xmath87@xmath85 and higher , significant deactivation was predicted , mainly due to the formation of @xmath60 clusters .",
    "both concentration and temperature influenced the contributions of different defects .",
    "for example , the concentration of @xmath60 clusters has reached the concentration of isolated arsenic atoms in the lattice @xmath78 for @xmath88 @xmath12@xmath85 at a temperature of 700@xmath0c and for @xmath89 @xmath87@xmath85 at a temperature of 1000@xmath0c .    in @xcite",
    "the authors have attempted to explain the effect of the electron concentration saturation at high doping levels .",
    "however , the calculations performed in these papers show that saturation is not reachable even at very high arsenic concentrations .",
    "for example , saturation was not reached with the arsenic concentration of @xmath90 @xmath12m@xmath85 at a temperature of 700@xmath0c , which is in disagreement with the experimental data ( see fig . 2 from @xcite ) .",
    "it is important that , according to , @xcite dp(2 ) clusters proposed by chadi et al . in @xcite",
    "may be present as a deactivating species , insignificantly contributing to the deactivation under conditions of full equilibration .",
    "these new defects , first mentioned in @xcite and called dp , represent a pair of two three - fold coordinated donor atoms .",
    "the lowest energy dp structures are dp(2 ) and dp(4 ) , where the donor atoms occupy either second- or fourth - neighbor si sites along the @xmath91 direction .",
    "it was shown that dp(2 ) exist in the stable electrically active 2 + charge state that is donating electrons to the conduction band or in the metastable neutral charge state capturing two electrons from the fermi sea .",
    "a very important conclusion made in @xcite is a threefold coordination of each dopant atom in dp(2 ) in the neutral trap state .",
    "thus , relaxation of the neighboring si atoms creates an increased volume , which is consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "therefore , such an increased volume around the donor atoms is possible without vacancies .",
    "the main ideas of @xcite were further developed in .",
    "@xcite citrin et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a new class of defects , called the donor - pair - vacancy - interstitials and composed of two dopant donor atoms near the displaced si atom that is forming a vacancy - interstitial pair .",
    "this defect , which is like a hybrid of the donor - pair and frenkel - pair defects , is denoted dp(i)v - i . for the case of sb ,",
    "the data of annular dark - field ( `` z - contrast '' ) scanning transmission electron microscopy ( adf - stem ) clearly demonstrate that , in heavily sb - doped silicon grown at low temperatures , the primary deactivating defect contains only two sb atoms .",
    "@xcite thus , energetically favorable @xmath92 and @xmath93 may be ruled out from the deactivation process",
    ". only @xmath94 , dp(2 ) , and dp(4 ) may be considered as liable candidates . using additional stem measurements , x - ray absorption data , and first - principles calculations , voyles et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that neither @xmath94 nor dp(2 ) and dp(4 ) defects are important in heavily sb - doped si . at that time , dp(2)v - i and dp(4)v - i were in line with the available experimental results , including positron annihilation spectroscopy data . @xcite both dp(2)v - i and dp(4)v - i are independent out of the pre - existing vacancy population , which is in conformity with the observations of .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless ,",
    "as follows from the experimental data , @xcite a deactivation mechanism can be different in the as- and sb - doped silicon .",
    "the mechanism of arsenic clustering calls for further investigation . in , @xcite mueller et al .",
    "have investigated the electronic structure and charge states of various vacancy - impurity clusters using the first - principles density - functional theory ( dft ) .",

    "the first - principles calculations were performed to explain the coupled diffusion phenomenona and clustering in heavily arsenic - doped silicon .",
    "as contrast to , @xcite it was found that the @xmath19 cluster is less mobile due to its high migration barrier .",
    "however , these clusters can contribute to the diffusion of as at elevated temperatures .",
    "proceeding from the presented analysis , our understanding of the clustering mechanisms is neither complete nor firmly established .",
    "this concerns the number of arsenic atoms in the cluster as well as its structure .",
