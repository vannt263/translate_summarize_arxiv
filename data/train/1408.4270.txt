    "axisymmetric , static , vacuum solutions of the einstein field equations can be described by the weyl formalism @xcite .",

    "in general such a configuration is not gravitationally stable .",
    "indeed , the nonlinear terms of the remaining equations are responsible for the occurrence of gravitationally inert singular structures , `` struts '' and `` membranes '' , that keep the bodies apart making the configuration as stable . in this paper",
    "we are concerned in analyzing circular orbits in spacetimes representing superpositions of two or three chazy - curzon particles .",
    "however , the whole discussion ( and results ) can be easily extended to the analogous situation of superpositions of two or three schwarzschild black holes , or in the mixed case of schwarzschild black hole and chazy - curzon particle fields superposed , as ( briefly ) shown in the appendix .",
    "it can be shown ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that all these solutions are characterized by a conical singularity on the @xmath7axis , the occurrence of which is related to the non - vanishing of the function @xmath8 on the portion of the axis between the sources or outside them . in the former case we can interpret the singular segment of the axis as a strut holding the bodies apart , while in the latter one as a pair of cords on which the bodies are suspended .",
    "the strut is represented by a perfect fluid with a pressure and a negative energy density equal to it ; qualitatively , the energy of the strut can be thought as the interaction energy between the bodies , while its pressure prevents the gravitational collapse of the system .",
    "the effective gravitational mass of the strut vanishes @xcite ; as a consequence , it makes no contribution to the gravitational potential @xmath9 .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the discussion present in the literature on this topic is very limited , a part for the pioneering works of semerk , zellerin and @xmath10@xmath11ek @xcite , who were but interested in solutions representing stationary axisymmetric sources around black holes , i.e. accretion disks or rings of astrophysical interest .",
    "the reason for which this class of solutions is poorly studied is mainly due to the presence of singularities , often dismissed as representative of non - physical situations . on the other hand , singularities are somehow typical in general relativity and it is especially in order to better understand their role and their proper character in this quite simple class of solutions that the present paper has been conceived .",
    "circular orbits are very well known for general stationary ( and static ) spacetimes @xcite and they are considered here as a convenient tool to perform the above mentioned analysis .",
    "the results will be mainly discussed by graphics because of the very long formulas involved in the treatment of such solutions .",
    "let us consider a family of test particles moving along the @xmath12 direction with constant speed ; the ( timelike ) 4-velocity @xmath13 associated to a generic orbit within the family is the following : @xmath14=\\gamma_n [ n + \\nu   e_{\\hat\\phi}]=\\cosh \\alpha\\ ,   n + \\sinh \\alpha\\ ,   e_{\\hat\\phi}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 are the angular velocity , linear velocity and rapidity parametrization respectively of the whole family , satisfying the mutual relations @xmath18 @xmath19 is defined by the timelike condition @xmath20 as @xmath21 @xmath22 is the four - velocity of the standard family of static observers with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 being the associated orthonormal spatial directions ; finally @xmath26 is the lorentz factor .",
    "even if we are concerned here with timelike orbits , it is worth noticing that the case of null orbits for co - rotating and counter - rotating photons correspond to the angular velocities : @xmath27    the non - vanishing components of the 4-acceleration @xmath28 along @xmath13 are given by @xmath29=e^{\\psi-\\gamma } \\gamma_n^2 [ \\psi_{,\\rho } -\\frac{\\nu^2}{\\rho}(1-\\rho \\psi_{,\\rho } ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ a(u)^{\\hat z}&=&e^{\\psi-\\gamma}\\psi_{,z}\\frac{e^{4\\psi}+\\rho^2\\zeta^2}{e^{4\\psi}-\\rho^2\\zeta^2}= e^{\\psi-\\gamma}\\psi_{,z}\\gamma_n^2 ( 1+\\nu^2 ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the lines of force of the acceleration or gravitoelectric  field associated to a single orbit ( i.e. with fixed @xmath16 ) are defined by the condition @xmath30    in the same way as one can consider the family of all the circular orbits as describing a branch of hyperbola in the relative motion @xmath31 plane , equations ( [ acccomp ] ) are the parametric equations for an acceleration curve  in the @xmath32 acceleration @xmath33 plane ; eliminating the parameter @xmath16 , the cartesian equation of this acceleration curve here ( at @xmath4 and @xmath5 fixed ) is simply a straight line @xmath34 the absolute value of the acceleration is @xmath35^{1/2}\\ , \\ ] ] and it is symmetric as a function of @xmath16 ; one can also introduce polar coordinates in the acceleration plane : @xmath36 so that @xmath37 moreover , the lie relative curvature @xcite of the orbits is @xmath38 , with components @xmath39 one can also introduce a polar representation for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and study the corresponding lines of force defined by @xmath42 showing also that this vector is orthogonal to the @xmath43 hypersurfaces .",
    "the discussion presented above is quite standard now and it follows the notation of @xcite .",
    "special orbits can be selected so that @xmath44^{1/2 } , \\qquad \\nu_{\\pm}=\\pm \\left[-1+\\frac{1}{\\rho\\psi_{,\\rho}}\\right]^{-1/2},\\ ] ] which permits the component @xmath45 to vanish ; the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath46 then become @xmath47^{1/2}\\ , \\qquad a^{\\hat z}\\big\\vert_{\\zeta=\\zeta_{\\pm}}=e^{\\psi-\\gamma}\\frac{\\psi_{,z}}{1 - 2\\rho\\psi_{,\\rho } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the further requirement @xmath48 ( and so @xmath49 ) gives the conditions for circular geodesics expressed in terms of the parameters of the sources and their relative position .",
    "these geodesics become null at the radius such that @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , orbits corresponding to extremal values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 among the whole family are also special ; for instance , the condition @xmath53 selects the extremely accelerated ",

    "the complementary condition @xmath55 gives only @xmath56 , which can also be interpreted in the ambit of the frenet - serret formalism @xcite giving the result that the orbits have vanishing the frenet - serret second torsion .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath57 at the same radius at which the geodesics become null : @xmath49 , @xmath58 .",
    "finally , by using @xmath59 and @xmath40 the components of the acceleration can be cast in the form @xmath60 and the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath61 becomes @xmath62",
    "in this section we discuss the cases of superimposed weyl fields due to two or three chazy - curzon particles .    a single chazy - curzon particle is a static axisymmetric solution of einstein equations endowed with a singularity at the particle position @xcite .",
    "the curzon metric is generated by the newtonian potential of a spherically symmetric point mass using the weyl formalism ( see ( [ ccsolw ] ) ) , and can be obtained from the correspondent potential representing a schwarzschild black hole ( whose generating newtonian potential ( [ ssbsol ] ) is , instead , that of a line mass ) by linearizing it with respect to the mass of the rod .",
    "the singularity is not point - like , but rather ring - like @xcite , exhibiting directional properties .",
    "in fact , at the particle location the first kretschmann invariant @xmath63 can be zero , infinite or finite , according to the direction of approach to the singularity .",
    "for instance , approaching the singularity along the @xmath7axis the kretschmann invariant @xmath64 ; as a consequence all the geodesics which approach the particle location , either along the @xmath7axis or tending to it asymptotically , do not meet a curvature singularity in the sense of @xmath65 diverging at that point .",
    "we first consider the case of one particle located at the origin @xmath66 and the other displaced along the @xmath7axis at the position @xmath67 , with @xmath68 satisfying a certain condition expressed in terms of the particle or black hole parameters ; then we study the addition of a third particle at the position @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "the properties of the circular orbits at any radius and at different values of the coordinate @xmath5 and varying the distance parameter @xmath71 are studied with the aid of graphics .    in the appendix we put details necessary to repeat the whole discussion presented here in the case in which the weyl fields are due to two schwarzschild black holes and to a combination of both schwarzschild black holes and chazy - curzon particles .",
    "extensions to cases involving any number of such particles can be easily treated too .",
    "the solution corresponding to the superposition of two chazy - curzon particles with masses @xmath72 and @xmath73 and positions @xmath74 and @xmath75 on the @xmath7axis respectively is given by metric ( [ weylmetric ] ) with functions @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be obtained by solving einstein s equations ( [ einsteqs ] ) : @xmath79 the value of arbitrary constant @xmath80 can be determined by imposing the elementary flatness condition @xmath81 from which we have @xmath82 the relevant cases to analyze are the following :    * case 1 : @xmath83 ( and , analogously , @xmath84 ) : @xmath85 * case 2 : @xmath86 : @xmath87    the arbitrary constant @xmath80 can not be uniquely chosen in order the function @xmath78 to vanish on the whole @xmath7axis : a @xmath88 gives rise to the well known conical singularity , corresponding to a strut in compresson , which holds the two particles apart .",
    "the choice @xmath89 makes @xmath90 only on the segment @xmath86 of the @xmath7axis between the sources . in the following we use @xmath91 , that makes @xmath90 on the portion of the axis outside the sources ( @xmath84 and @xmath83 ) .    in section 2",
