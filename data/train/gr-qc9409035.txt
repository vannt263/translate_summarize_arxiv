    "that gravitational collapse leads to black hole formation is widely accepted , yet comparitively little is known about the generic features of collapse .",
    "this is well exemplified by the lack of a precise formulation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis@xcite .",
    "the reason for this is simply our lack of the mathematical tools necessary to analyse the evolution of generic initial data , although some progress is being made on this front  .",
    "moreover the complexity of the einstein field equations counsels retreat to a more tractable system which may capture the essence of the physics .",
    "spherically symmetric general relativity coupled to a massless scalar field is one such system .",
    "indeed this model has been studied in great detail both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite .",
    "christodoulou has rigorously established global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the einstein - scalar field equations and has discussed the general properties of these solutions  @xcite .",
    "he has even established a sufficient condition for the formation of a trapped surface in the future evolution of a given initial data set  @xcite .",
    "numerical investigations have also provided useful insights into black hole formation .",
    "the most recent of these studies , by choptuik  @xcite , has revealed several intriguing phenomena which were hitherto unknown .",
    "choptuik considered the numerical evolution of initial data sets characterised by a single parameter ( @xmath0 say ) .",
    "the resulting families of solutions , @xmath1 $ ] , include both geometries containing black holes , and geometries with only slight deviations from flatness , depending on the value of @xmath0",
    ". between these two extremes lies a critical evolution with @xmath2 , which signals the transition between complete dispersal and black hole formation .",
    "his most interesting results pertain to near critical , @xmath3 , evolutions which exhibit a particularly simple strong field behaviour .",
    "in fact , his results strongly suggest that near critical evolutions may be described by a single , universal solution of the field equations .",
    "two quantitative features also emerge from his work : ( i ) near critical evolutions contain echoes in the strong field region ( i.e. form invariant quantities exhibit a scaling relation like ( [ echoes ] ) below , with @xmath4 ) . based on his extensive investigations choptuik has conjectured that the exactly critical solution has an infinite train of echoes in the strong field region approaching the singularity .",
    "( ii ) when black holes form in near critical evolutions the mass scales as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an apparently universal constant determined numerically to be about @xmath7    obtaining analytical results about solutions which exhibit a discrete self - similarity of the type discussed by choptuik has proved to be extremely difficult  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it has been argued that the piling up of the echoes as the singularity is approached suggests that a continuous self - similarity may be a good approximation in this neighbourhood .",
    "therefore it seems worthwhile to examine collapse under the assumption of a continuous self - similarity .",
    "furthermore i would like to draw attention to a possible explanation of the echoing , discovered by choptuik , in terms of a continuous self - similarity . in curvature",
    "coordinates the spherical line element may be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "self - similarity implies that there exists a time coordinate such that the metric depends only on the combination @xmath13 , consequently quantities like @xmath14 satisfy the relation @xmath15 for arbitrary values of @xmath16 .",
    "now , consider a coordinate tranformation to a new time , @xmath17 say , in terms of which @xmath18 where the function @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 only for discrete values of @xmath16 . in terms of this new time",
    "coordinate the form invariant quantities examined by choptuik , along with @xmath21 , would all appear to have a discrete ( rather than continuous ) self similarity",
    ". how could this be the origin of the discreteness in the numerical work , after all choptuik  @xcite states quite clearly that he uses central proper time to describe the solutions  this corresponds to the similarity time @xmath12 in a spacetime which is _ everywhere _ self - similar .",
    "however it is likely , and indeed suggested by numerical work , that ( discrete ) self - similarity holds only on intermediate scales , @xmath22 say .",
    "( this has been further highlighted in numerical studies of radiation fluids  @xcite . )",
    "thus it is possible that the time coordinate used in the numerical studies does _ not _ correspond to the similarity time .",
    "it should be noted that even if this is true the appearance of the universal scaling constant @xmath23 continues to be a mystery .    in any case , this paper is concerned with homothetic spacetimes ; it is assumed that there exists a vector field @xmath24 such that the spacetime metric satisfies @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the lie derivative with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the homothetic collapse of perfect fluids has received a great deal of attention during the past few years  @xcite , where the main thrust of work was searches for naked singularities  @xcite .",
    "the problem of homothetic , scalar field collapse has received comparitively little attention  @xcite , and no examples of naked singularities which evolved from regular initial data were previously known for this form of matter .",
    "the reduction of the scalar field equations to an autonomous system allows me to give a detailed description of all the solutions .",
    "two interesting features emerge from the analysis : firstly the existence of solutions with naked singularities , and secondly the occurence of phase transitions in the system .",
    "the critical point behaviour is of two distinct forms .",
    "the first is a phase transition from solutions which ( roughly ) represent dispersal , to geometries representing black holes .",
    "it has been suggested elsewhere  @xcite that the critical solution implied by the numerical results may be both on the verge of black hole formation and being a naked singularity .",
    "we will see below that the second phase transition corresponds to such a situation  the critical evolution lies at the boundary between black holes and naked singularities . in this article",
    "the term black hole is used rather loosely to mean that an apparent horizon exists and precedes a central singularity .",
    "of course it is possible to obtain an asymptotically flat solution to the einstein - scalar equations by cutting off the self - similar evolution at some advanced time and matching it to a less symmetric ( not self - similar ) exterior , in this way one would obtain an asymptotically flat , black - hole spacetime .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section  ii the field equations for the self - similar collapse are derived in terms of a retarded time coordinate @xmath27 and a radial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "the most general ( see appendix a ) scalar field evolution consistent with the homothetic symmetry of the spacetime is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an arbitrary ( positive ) constant .",
    "these equations have already been derived in  @xcite and used to provide initial data in a search for naked singularities .",
    "a field redefinition transforms the equations into a non - linear autonomous system which is amenable to standard techniques  @xcite .",
    "it is then shown that the solutions fall into two distinct classes depending on the value of @xmath29 .",
    "solutions of the first type ( @xmath30 ) are shown to be singular only at one point on @xmath31 .",
    "this singularity is not naked ; distant observers can not see it by waiting a finite proper time .",
    "the transition point is at @xmath32 , although the exactly critical solution actually belongs to the first class .",
    "for each @xmath33 there exists a continuous infinity of solutions with a non - singular origin . for a given value of @xmath29 solutions can represent black holes or naked singularities , with a critical point evolution interpolating between these two extremes .",
    "the analytic examples of phase transitions which have been discussed in the literature  @xcite are of this type , in fact they correspond to the case @xmath34 when the equations can be integrated in closed form .",
    "this solution is briefly discussed to explain how it fits into the general analysis presented here .",
    "section  iv contains some discussion of the results , and their possible significance .",
    "the notation of  @xcite is adopted throughout the paper , and detailed calculations which might distract from the main line of thought are relegated to the appendices .",
    "using retarded bondi coordinates @xmath35 the spherical line element may be written @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the standard line element on the unit two - sphere .",
    "the origin is singular unless @xmath40 when @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore it is convenient to normalise the coordinate @xmath27 so that it represents proper time for an observer at the origin , thus write @xmath41 the einstein - scalar field equations are then @xmath42 \\ ; , \\label{eqn : efe3 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a comma denotes partial differentiation .",
    "@xmath43 is a massless , minimally coupled scalar field satisfying @xmath44    spherical symmetry allows the introduction of a local mass function @xmath45   defined by @xmath46 where @xmath11 is the function which determines the area of the two - spheres .",
    "this mass function agrees with both the adm and bondi masses in the appropriate limits , and is equivalent to the hawking quasi - local mass in this case .",
    "the existence of a homothetic symmetry in a spherical spacetime implies that the metric depend only on @xmath47 , and that the scalar field evolve as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is some function to be determined and @xmath29 is constant ( see appendix a for a proof of this fact ) . writing @xmath50 the self - similar equations derived from ( [ eqn : efe1])-([eqn : efe3 ] ) are @xmath51 \\ ; , \\label{eqn : ss4 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime ( @xmath52 ) denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath53 . in deriving ( [ eqn : ss4 ] ) from ( [ eqn : efe3 ] ) it is necessary to use ( [ eqn : ss1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : ss2 ] ) to eliminate derivatives of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "it is however convenient to recast the system in an autonomous form before discussing the solutions .",
    "analysis of the above equations is facilitated by the field redefinitions @xmath62 and the introduction of a new coordinate @xmath63 upon substitution into ( [ eqn : ss1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : ss2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : ss3 ] ) one obtains the three dimensional , non - linear autonomous system @xmath64 the system is effectively two dimensional , however , since @xmath65 is determined by the algebraic relation @xmath66 provided @xmath67 .",
    "further discussion is therefore couched in terms of a projection into the @xmath68-plane .",
    "consistent with the initial condition ( [ eqn : bc2 ] ) the positive square root is taken in ( [ gamma ] ) , however it must be emphasised that solutions may still evolve continuously onto the other leaf of the surface defined by taking the negative square root above .",
    "indeed it is solutions of this type which have naked singularities .    requiring that the mass function , defined in ( [ eqn : mass1 ] ) , should be positive or zero implies @xmath69 , while @xmath65 is real only if @xmath70 black hole formation is signalled by @xmath71 ( technically this is the condition which locates an apparent horizon in the spacetime ) .",
    "the continuation of the solution to negative values of @xmath72 will not be considered in the sequel , thus , integral curves of interest lie in the strip @xmath73 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath65 is not continuous at @xmath74 thus invalidating the usual existence and uniqueness theorems for systems of ordinary differential equations at this point .",
    "this has the important consequence that integral curves of the differential equations may intersect at ( [ eqn : singpt ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the continuation of such solutions is not always uniquely defined , in some cases there exists an infinite family of possibilities .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below and in appendix  c.    the character of the solutions shows a strong dependence on the value of @xmath29 .",
    "solving ( [ eqn : ss1])-([eqn : ss3 ] ) , subject to the regularity conditions on @xmath31 , gives rise to two essentially different classes of solution according as @xmath75 is greater than or less than unity ; they are solutions which do not contain black holes , and solutions which contain either black holes or naked singularities .",
    "the critical evolution ( @xmath76 ) also belongs to the first class .",
    "the transition from one class to the other as one adjusts @xmath29 is similar to the behaviour discussed by choptuik  @xcite .",
    "a second type of phase transition from solutions containing black holes to those with naked singularities occurs for _ each _ value of @xmath29 in the range @xmath77 .",
    "this may simply be an artifact of the restriction to self - similar continuations past the point ( [ eqn : singpt ] ) however no other continuations are considered here .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed in tolman - bondi collapse  @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ eqn : aut1])-([eqn : aut3 ] ) has two stationary points , one on either leaf of ( [ gamma ] ) , given by @xmath78 the nature of these points depends on the value of @xmath29 .",
    "it is discussed below and in appendix  b.",
    "the self - similar solutions fall quite naturally into two distinct classes depending on the value of @xmath29 .",
    "class i solutions do not contain black holes or naked singularities although they are singular at one point on @xmath31 . in the second class are solutions which have naked singularities or black holes ; a single critical evolution having a null singularity ( which is _ not _ naked ) interpolates between these two extremes . for completeness , at the end of this section it is shown how the results of  @xcite fit into the overall picture .      for @xmath29 in this range only the stationary point",
    "@xmath80 is of interest .",

    "it is shown that integral curves only cross @xmath90 at @xmath91 , and that the solution passing through this point is unique when @xmath92 .",
    "a direct consequence of this is that the solution with a non - singular origin approaches the asymptotic form ( [ eqn : critpt1 ] ) , its evolution being characterised by a sequence of decaying oscillations in @xmath72 about the value @xmath93 .",

    "one also finds that an observer at a ( large ) fixed radius takes an infinite proper time to reach @xmath82 .",
    "a central observer , on the other hand , reaches the singularity at @xmath82 in finite proper time .",
    "it is , however , only after he has seen the entire history of the universe in a tremendous flash .",

    "it must be emphasised that this solution is unstable , in the sense that an arbitrarily small change in the value of @xmath29 drastically changes the character of the resulting solution .",

    "these solutions are more interesting than those in class  i. in fact for each @xmath29 in the range @xmath106 there appears to be a continuous infinity of solutions with a regular origin .",

    "some of the solutions evolve onto the negative leaf of ( [ gamma ] ) ; @xmath72 undergoes a single oscillation before decreasing monotonically to @xmath112 . while i have no analytic proof that all of these solutions contain black holes , the numerical results ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 ) suggest this is true .",
    "the single exceptional solution exhibits a behaviour which has been discussed elsewhere  @xcite ; beyond @xmath107 no black hole forms , instead the solution asymptotically approaches one of the stationary points ( [ stpt ] ) .",

    "( [ geo2 ] ) ] , corresponding to a cauchy horizon in the spacetime . for sufficiently small @xmath29",
    "there are solutions which evolve from the singular point onto the negative leaf of ( [ gamma ] ) , asymptoting to @xmath91 as @xmath115 . a typical solution of this type is shown in fig .  4 , for @xmath116 .",

    "the cauchy horizon is also a null orbit of the homothetic killing vector , therefore the work of lake and zannias   implies that the singularity is strong in the sense that tidal forces diverge at it .",
    "notice also that the metric can be made manifestly regular at the cauchy horizon by transforming to the new coordinate given by @xmath124 these spacetimes confirm that naked singularities , which evolve from regular initial data , also exist for scalar field sources .",
    "whether they are stable to non - homothethic , not to mention non - spherical , perturbations is an open question although the work of goldwirth and piran  @xcite suggests that they are not .",
    "there are two critical points where phase transitions are observed .",
    "each of the exactly critical solutions , which interpolates between naked singularities and black holes , asymptotically approaches one of the stationary points  ( [ stpt ] ) .",
    "therefore these spacetimes have the structure shown in fig .  3 , with a null singularity at @xmath82 , @xmath31 .    as @xmath29 decreases further , the topology of the phase space changes slightly ; only a single phase transition occurs going from black holes to naked singularities .",
    "the solutions ( including the single critical evolution ) are the same as those already discussed .      when @xmath125 the scalar field is a function of @xmath96 only and the equations ( [ eqn : ss1])-([eqn : ss4 ] ) can be exactly integrated  @xcite .",
    "the resulting solution was first discovered by roberts  @xcite and may be written as @xmath126 and @xmath127 the integral curves are plotted in fig .  5 .",

    "when @xmath128 the integral curve leaves @xmath90 , @xmath87 and approaches the stationary point ( [ stpt ] ) .",
    "this exactly critical evolution lies between solutions which contain black holes ( @xmath111 , @xmath129 along the integral curves ) and those which evolve back to flat space ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 along the integral curves ) .",
    "since this is a saddle point we see that near critical evolutions ( sub- or super - critical ) can approach this point arbitrarily closely before moving away in their respective directions .",
    "@xmath125 is therefore exceptional because the subcritical evolutions have zero mass on the cauchy horizon , @xmath82 , as is readily seen by taking the limit @xmath104 in the above solution .",
    "this behaviour is also apparent in the asymptotic approach of the integral curves to the line @xmath87 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite the natural continuation past @xmath82 is minkowski space since there is no material flux across this surface on which @xmath132 .",
    "notice however that there is no self - similar extension of these solutions to @xmath31 which is non - singular .",
    "this discussion places the results obtained in @xcite within the more general context of self - similar spacetimes with scalar field matter sources .",
    "spherically symmetric , homothetic spacetimes have received a great deal of attention over the last few years due to the ease with which it is possible to construct naked singularities in such spacetimes .",
    "recent numerical studies of spherical collapse  @xcite suggest that self - similarity may play an important role in describing the approach to the singularity in gravitational collapse .",
    "this study of scalar field collapse was in fact motivated by the work of choptuik , where he observed discrete self - similarity in solutions on the verge of black hole formation .",
    "however it is not clear how a continuous self similarity , as discussed here , could be at the center of the results which he has obtained .",
    "nevertheless some interesting features do emerge from the study of spacetimes with a homothetic symmetry .",
    "the scalar field evolves as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is determined by the coupled einstein - scalar field equations .",
    "the constant @xmath29 distinguishes between two different classes of solution . the first class ( when @xmath135 ) are non - singular almost everywhere .",

    "when @xmath75 is only slightly less than unity all of these spacetimes contain apparent horizons .",
    "however for _ sufficiently _ small @xmath29 some of the spacetimes have naked singularities .",
    "@xmath138 marks the transition point from solutions of class  i to those of class  ii  in effect from no black holes to black holes .",
    "another phase transition occurs for each value of @xmath33  a transition from black holes to naked singularities .",
    "in particular the critical evolution is on the verge of being a naked singularity in this case .",
    "one might wonder if there is some way to classify the critical point behaviour more generally , and to which such class the _ generic _ case belongs .",
    "one of the most intriguing results obtained by choptuik was the scaling law for black hole mass , unfortunately self - similar spacetimes can not have finite mass black holes . in order to obtain an asymptotically flat spacetime it is necessary to cut off the self - similar evolution at some advanced time , and consider a suitable continuation ( which is not self - similar ) .",
    "goldwirth and piran  @xcite did exactly this , although they did not examine the behaviour of black hole mass as the critical point @xmath75 was approached .",
    "this question is currently under active investigation  @xcite , and it will be interesting to see if the mass exhibits the same behaviour which has been observed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we have in self - similar scalar field collapse further examples of spacetimes which violate cosmic censorship .",
    "one might be surprised about this were it not for the plethora of examples which now exist .",
    "what emerges from these examples ( generally ) is that there do exist initial data sets which when evolved according to the einstein equations lead to naked singularities , however the genericity of these data is far from clear .",
    "it therefore seems that the thrust of any attempt to formulate ( and prove ) cosmic censorship must address this issue directly .",
    "some interesting preliminary results have been obtained by lake  @xcite where he has shown that ( spherically symmetric ) spacetime in the neighbourhood of a naked singularity may be approximately self - similar .",
    "it therefore seems that future work on naked singularities must consider deviations from the symmetric situations treated to date .    finally in searching for a theoretical understanding of the results obtained by choptuik  @xcite and abrahams and evans  @xcite",
    "one might consider the obvious generalisation of hometheticity to a conformal symmetry ; that is to suppose the existence of a vector field @xmath24 such that @xmath139 if the dependence on position in @xmath140 is weak , solutions might behave like self - similar solutions with some sort of super - imposed periodicity .",
    "it would seem interesting to investigate this possibility .",
    "i would like to thank chris chambers , peter hogan , bruce jensen , ian moss and adrian ottewill for useful comments on this work .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank carsten gundlach whose comments and questions on an earlier draft of this paper have lead to a significantly different final version .",

    "the eigenvalues are @xmath162 where @xmath163 may be chosen independently of the sign of the square root .    when @xmath164 only @xmath165 is relevant for the discussion in section iii .",
    "both eigenvalues are real and have the same sign , @xmath166 , when @xmath167 so that the stationary point is an attractive node .",
    "once @xmath168 the eigenvalues become complex conjugate , and since @xmath169 they have negative real part .",
    "this is a positive attractor , with spiral behaviour .    when @xmath137 both stationary points are of interest .",
    "simply noting that @xmath170 the discussion of both is easily combined .",
    "clearly the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs since @xmath171 thus they are saddle points .",
    "in the above analysis it is important that integral curves can not cross @xmath172 except at @xmath112 or at @xmath91 .",
    "we now show that this is so , and derive the solution in the neighbourhood of @xmath90 , @xmath173 .",
    "the analysis is split into two cases : +   + ( i ) suppose an integral curve crosses @xmath90 at @xmath174 .",
    "writing @xmath175 and considering the @xmath176 limit of ( [ eqn : aut1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : aut2 ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) it is a straightforward matter to derive @xmath177 integrating this equation gives @xmath178 examining this expression shows that @xmath179 is the only place where integral curves may intersect @xmath90 .",
    "+   + ( ii ) it is necessary to treat the case when @xmath180 separately since the limit @xmath129 in ( [ gamma ] ) is more delicate . for this purpose",
    "we introduce @xmath181 as above and write @xmath182 where @xmath183 , thus @xmath184 substituting this approximate expression for @xmath65 into ( [ eqn : aut2 ] ) , and using @xmath181 as the independent variable we arrive at the equation @xmath185 and find @xmath186 where @xmath120 is a constant of integration . now",
    "the initial condition is @xmath187 when @xmath188 so that there are two distinct possibilities ; when @xmath164 the integration constant must vanish , implying that a single integral curve passes through this point . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath105 the constant is not fixed by the initial conditions and there is a one parameter family of curves passing through @xmath189 .",
    "it is exactly this fact which gives rise to the variety of solutions in class  ii .",
