    "this particular polymer motion in shear flow has been thoroughly studied in the past . @xcite",
    "all these studies address the bulk case @xcite or grafted polymer chains , @xcite but without considering the problem of adsorption . in this work",
    ", the frequency of this cyclic motion is calculated for the three geometries ( bulk , nv and ng ) via the fourier transform of the time - dependent radius of gyration , which is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the chain center of mass at time @xmath8 .",
    "the first main peak position of the resulting fourier transform of @xmath109 ( not shown here ) is chosen as the tumbling frequency .",
    "figure [ fig : frequency ] displays the reduced tumbling frequency ( @xmath110 ) as a function of the reduced shear rate @xmath50 . the purely 2d case is also shown as a reference . thereby , scaling behaviors of the form @xmath111 are observed , with @xmath112 for ng , nv , and bulk , respectively .",
    "hence , the bulk and nv cases , exhibit ( within statistical uncertainties ) an identical scaling behavior for the tumbling frequency .",
    "the value found for the exponent @xmath113 is in very good agreement with the one reported by schroeder et al .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath114 ) , based on the angular power spectral frequency , for brownian rods in the bulk . as expected the ng case exhibits a different scaling behavior ( here @xmath115 ) due to the chain adsorption that weakens the effect of the velocity gradient in the normal direction . to understand the physical origin of the observed scaling behaviour of the tumbling frequency in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency ] , we are going to employ the arguments advocated by teixeira et al . @xcite . by decomposing the tumbling motion into typical time periods : ( i ) a stretching phase ( @xmath116 ) , ( ii ) an alignment along the shear direction ( @xmath117 ) , ( iii ) a flip motion ( @xmath118 ) , and ( iv ) a collapse event ( @xmath119 ) , we can write an expression for the tumbling frequency @xcite @xmath120 @xmath121 the three processes of polymer stretching , aligning and collapsing being advection - driven , teixeira _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath119 scale like @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the average chain extension in the @xmath18-flow - direction and @xmath124 is the chain extension in the shear gradient direction .",
    "on the other hand , the flipping process is a diffusive motion such that @xmath125 , @xcite where @xmath126 is the diffusivity in the shear gradient direction and found to be @xmath127 from bd simulations by doyle _ et al._. @xcite following the same procedure with our simulation data , we were then able to extract the time duration scalings which are gathered in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    ".characteristic times involved in the tumbling motion discussed in the text .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these results in table [ tab : table1 ] are in good agreement , for the nv case and the bulk , with the observed exponent ( @xmath128 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency ] ) . even for the ng case ,",
    "the scaling predictions are validated for the convective processes ( stretching , alignment , collapsing ) .",
    "nonetheless , it fails for @xmath118 in the ng case because the strong adsorption weakens the diffusivity in the shear gradient ( @xmath61 ) direction @xmath126 .",
    "using brownian dynamics simulations , the statistical properties of adsorbed polymers under a linear shear flow have been studied for the two cases : in - adsorption - plane shear gradient ( or equivalently the shear vorticity normal to the adsorbing wall ) , and the shear gradient perpendicular to the wall . the three - dimensional bulk and the purely two - dimensional cases under linear shear flow",
    "have been considered as well as reference cases .",
    "we have compared the behaviour of the full polymer chain to that of a simple dumbbell model .",
    "a good agreement is reached for the pdf of the chain end - to - end distance . besides , the theoretically predicted scaling behaviour @xcite of the angular pdf tails",
    "is confirmed also in the case where the shear gradient is parallel to the walls ( nv case ) . in the opposite case of perpendicular shear gradient ( ng case ) , agreement is only found at high shear rates .",
    "it is remarkable that a simple dumbbell model can capture the correct scaling behaviour of the angular pdfs tails of a full monomer - resolved chain .",
    "the chain coiling and stretching degree was characterized by the inner bond - bond angles . for the nv , bulk and 2d cases ,",
    "the shear rate dependency is found to be rather strong in the first low shear rate regime , but is much weaker at higher shear rates , and a plateau - like behavior is approached once the shear rate is high enough . for the ng case ,",
    "this dependency is much weaker for a wide range of shear rates .",
    "the tumbling frequency in the bulk scales sublinearly with shear flow rate , which is in agreement with the early studies .",
    "@xcite we found this sublinear scaling also in the adsorbed cases ( nv , ng ) . the theoretical scaling analysis based on the dumbbell model ,",
    "@xcite was confirmed for the nv case but not for the ng case .    as an outlook , understanding the stretching and coiling mechanisms of polymer in flow leads to an improved control over chain configurations in various circumstances of confinement , e.g.  in microfluidic devices .",
    "@xcite stretched polymer chains may provide valuable candidates for nanowires in microcircuits . @xcite",
    "therefore a minimalistic model , as the simple fene dumbbell model , is useful in order to map the behaviour of a complex system and to predict the qualitative trends in various flow situations .    for future studies , many polymer chains , i.e. a concentrated polymer solution , may exhibit complex dynamical behaviour due to significant slowing down caused by mutual chain entanglements .",
    "@xcite it is further interesting to mix nanoparticles and polymers @xcite and expose them to different flow fields and study their collective dynamical behaviour .",
    "@xcite finally , the influence of hydrodynamic interactions need more consideration , following the recent simulation method proposed in ref @xcite ."
