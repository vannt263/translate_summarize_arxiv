    "quarkonia are flavorless bound states composed of combinations of quarks and their antiquarks .",
    "since discovery of @xmath2 meson in 1974 , many new quarkonia states have been detected .",
    "the quarkonia systems consist of charmonium and bottomonium . due to the large mass",
    "there are no toponium bound states and no light quark - antiquark states because of the mixture of the light quarks in experiments .",
    "the large mass difference between charm and bottom quarks prevents them from mixing .",
    "the heavy quark bound states may provide key tools for understanding the interactions between quarks , new hadronic production mechanisms and transitions , the magnitude of the ckm matrix elements and also analyzing the results of heavy - ion experiments .",
    "the @xmath3 suppression in ultra relativistic heavy - ion collisions was first suggested as a signal of the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "however , most recently , attentions have shifted to the bottomonium states due to that they are more massive than charmonium states .",
    "the bottom quarks and anti - quarks are relatively rare within the plasma , so the probability for reproduction of the bottomonium states through recombination is much smaller than for charm quarks .",
    "consequently , it is expected that the bottomonium system to be a cleaner probe of the qgp than the charmonium system .",
    "hence investigations on the properties of bottomonium systems can help us get useful information not only about the nature of the @xmath4 systems , but also on the existence of qgp .    since the discovery of quarkonium states , qcd sum rule technique as one of the most powerful nonperturbative tools to hadron physics @xcite has played an important role in understanding the quarkonia spectrum . in order to find missing states one should know their physical properties to develop a successful search strategy .",
    "clearly significant progress in understanding of quarkonium production can not be reached without detailed measurements of the cross sections and fractions of the quarkonia .",
    "thereby , form factors and decay widths of quarkonia become significant for completing quarkonia spectrum . completing",
    "the bottomonium spectrum is a crucial validation of theoretical calculations and a test of our understanding of bottomonium states in the context of the quark model .",
    "bottomonium states are considered as great laboratories to search for the properties od qcd at low energies .    in this connection",
    ", we investigate the decay properties of tensor @xmath5 meson as one of the important members of the bottomonia to the heavy @xmath6 meson in the present work .",
    "the @xmath6 meson with @xmath7 is the only meson consists of two heavy quarks with different flavors . yet ,",
    "other possible @xmath6 states ( the scalar , vector , axial - vector and tensor ) have not been observed , however many new @xmath6 species are expected to be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the near future .",
    "taking into account the two - gluon condensate corrections , the transition form factors of the semileptonic @xmath8 decay channel are calculated within the three - point qcd sum rule .",
    "we use the values of transition form factors to estimate the decay rate of the transition under consideration at all lepton channels .",
    "the interpolating current of @xmath5 with quantum numbers @xmath9 contains derivatives with respect to space - time .",
    "so , we start our calculations in the coordinate space then we apply the fourier transformation to go to the momentum space . to suppress the contributions of the higher states and continuum , we apply a double borel transformation .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "we derive the qcd sum rules for the transition form factors in section ii .",
    "last section is devoted to the numerical analysis of the obtained sum rules , estimation of the decay rates at all lepton channels and concluding remarks .",
    "the semileptonic @xmath10 decay is based on @xmath11 transition at quark level whose effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi weak coupling constant and @xmath14 is element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix .",
    "after sandwiching the effective hamiltonian between the initial and final states , the amplitude of this transition is obtained in terms of transition matrix elements .",
    "these matrix elements will be parameterized in terms of transition form factors later .    in order to start our calculations , we consider the three - point correlation function @xmath15 where  @xmath16 is the time - ordering operator and @xmath17 is the transition current .",
