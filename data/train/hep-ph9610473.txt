    "in hadron interactions at collider energies , @xmath0 pair production proceeds through partonic hard - scattering processes involving initial - state light quarks @xmath1 and gluons @xmath2 . in lowest - order perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , @xmath3 ,",
    "the two partonic subprocesses are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "calculations of the cross section through next - to - leading order , @xmath6 , involve gluonic radiative corrections to these lowest - order subprocesses as well as contributions from the @xmath7 initial state  @xcite",
    ". a complete fixed - order calculation at order @xmath8 does not exist .",
    "the physical cross section for each production channel is obtained through the convolution @xmath9 the square of the total hadronic center - of - mass energy is @xmath10 , the square of the partonic center - of - mass energy is @xmath11 , @xmath12 denotes the top mass , @xmath13 is the usual factorization and renormalization scale , and @xmath14 is the parton flux .",
    "the variable @xmath15 measures the distance from the partonic threshold .",
    "the indices @xmath16 denote the initial parton channel . the partonic cross section @xmath17 is obtained commonly from fixed - order qcd calculations  @xcite , or , as described here , from calculations that go beyond fixed - order perturbation theory through the inclusion of gluon resummation  @xcite to all orders in the strong coupling strength @xmath18 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19 .",
    "the total physical cross section is obtained after incoherent addition of the contributions from the the @xmath20 and @xmath21 production channels .",
    "comparison of the partonic cross section at next - to - leading order with its lowest - order value reveals that the ratio becomes very large in the near - threshold region .",
    "indeed , as @xmath22 , the  @xmath23-factor \" at the partonic level @xmath24 grows in proportion to @xmath25 .",
    "the very large mass of the top quark notwithstanding , the large ratio @xmath24 makes it evident that the next - to - leading order result does not necessarily provide a reliable quantitative prediction of the top quark production cross section at the energy of the tevatron collider .",
    "the large ratio casts doubt on the reliability of simple fixed - order perturbation theory for physical processes for which the near - threshold region in the subenergy variable contributes significantly to the physical cross section .",
    "top quark production at the fermilab tevatron is one such process , because the top mass is relatively large compared to the energy available .",
    "other examples include the production of hadronic jets that carry large values of transverse momentum and the production of pairs of supersymmetric particles with large mass . to obtain more reliable theoretical estimates of the cross section in perturbative qcd ,",
    "it is important first to identify and isolate the terms that provide the large next - to - leading order enhancement and then to resum these effects to all orders in the strong coupling strength .",
    "the origin of the large threshold enhancement may be traced to initial - state gluonic radiative corrections to the lowest - order channels .",
    "we remark that we are calculating the inclusive total cross section for the production of a top quark - antiquark pair , i.e. , the total cross section for @xmath26 .",
    "the partonic subenergy threshold in question is the threshold for @xmath27 any number of gluons .",
    "this coincides with the threshold in the invariant mass of the @xmath28 system for the lowest order subprocesses only .    for @xmath29 , we define the variable @xmath30 through the invariant @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the four - vector momenta of the gluon and top quark . in the limit that @xmath34 , the radiated gluon carries zero momentum .",
    "after cancellation of soft singularities and factorization of collinear singularities in @xmath6 , there is a left - over integrable large logarithmic contribution to the partonic cross section associated with initial - state gluon radiation .",
    "this contribution is often expressed in terms of  plus \" distributions . in @xmath6 , it is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "when integrated over the near - threshold region @xmath36 , it provides an excellent approximation to the full next - to - leading order physical cross section as a function of the top mass . at @xmath37 175 gev ,",
    "the ratio of the next - to - leading order to the leading order physical cross sections in the leading logarithmic approximation is @xmath381.22 .",
    "this ratio shows that the near - threshold logarithm builds up cross section in a worrisome fashion .",
    "it suggests that perturbation theory is not converging to a stable prediction of the cross section .",
    "the goal of gluon resummation is to sum the series in @xmath39 to all orders in @xmath40 in order to obtain a more defensible prediction .",
    "different methods of resummation differ in theoretically and phenomenologically important respects .",
    "formally , if not explicitly in some approaches , an integral over the radiated gluon momentum @xmath30 must be done over regions in which @xmath34 . therefore",
    ", one significant distinction among methods has to do with how the inevitable  non - perturbative \" region is handled . in the approach of laenen , smith , and van neerven ( lsvn )  @xcite , an undetermined infrared cutoff ( irc ) @xmath41 is introduced , with @xmath42 .",
    "the presence of an extra scale spoils the renormalization group properties of the overall expression .",
    "the unfortunate dependence of the resummed cross section on this undetermined cutoff is important numerically since it appears in an exponent  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate theoretical uncertainties in a method that requires an undetermined infrared cutoff .    -0.9",
    "the method of resummation we employ  @xcite is based on a perturbative truncation of principal - value resummation  @xcite .",
    "this approach has an important technical advantage in that it does not depend on arbitrary infrared cutoffs .",
    "because extra scales are absent , the method permits an evaluation of its perturbative regime of applicability , i.e. , the region of the gluon radiation phase space where perturbation theory should be valid .",
    "we work in the @xmath43 factorization scheme .",
    "factorization and evolution lead directly to exponentiation of the set of large threshold logarithms in moment ( @xmath44 ) space in terms of an exponent @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",

    "all large soft - gluon threshold contributions are included through the two - loop running of @xmath40 .",

    "the function @xmath45 is finite , and @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding partonic cross section is finite as @xmath50 .",
    "the function @xmath45 includes both perturbative and non - perturbative content .",
    "the non - perturbative content is not a prediction of perturbative qcd .",
    "we choose to use the exponent only in the interval in moment space in which the perturbative content dominates .",
    "we use the attractive finiteness of eq .",
    "( [ bseven ] ) to derive a perturbative asymptotic representation of @xmath51 that is valid in the moment - space interval @xmath52 the coefficient @xmath53 ; the number of flavors @xmath54 ; @xmath55 ; and @xmath56 .",

    "( [ tseven ] ) , terms in the exponent of the form @xmath66 are of order unity , and terms with fewer powers of logarithms , @xmath67 , are negligible .",

    "( [ tseven ] ) , ( [ teight ] ) , and ( [ tnine ] ) , without the principal - value prescription , although with less certitude  @xcite .",
    "after inversion of the mellin transform from moment space to the physically relevant momentum space , the resummed partonic cross sections , including all large threshold corrections , can be written @xmath71 the leading large threshold corrections are contained in the exponent @xmath72 , a calculable polynomial in @xmath73 .",
    "the derivative @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the lowest - order @xmath3 partonic cross section expressed in terms of inelastic kinematic variables",
    ". the upper limit of integration , @xmath76 , is set by the boundary between the perturbative and non - perturbative regimes , well specified within the context of the calculation , and @xmath77 is fixed by kinematics .",
    "perturbative resummation probes the threshold down to @xmath78 . below this value , perturbation theory , resummed or otherwise , is not to be trusted . for @xmath12 = 175 gev",
    ", we determine that the perturbative regime is restricted to values of the subenergy greater than 1.22 gev above the threshold ( @xmath79 ) in the @xmath80 channel and 8.64 gev above threshold in the @xmath21 channel .",
    "the difference reflects the larger color factor in the @xmath21 case .",
    "the value 1.22 gev is comparable to the decay width of the top quark .",
    "other than the top mass , the only undetermined scales are the qcd factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "we adopt a common value @xmath13 for both , and we vary this scale over the interval @xmath81 in order to evaluate the theoretical uncertainty of the numerical predictions .",
    "we use the cteq3 m parton densities  @xcite .",

    "the full range of @xmath83 extends to 25 , but we display the behavior only in the near - threshold region where resummation is important .",
    "we observe that , at the energy of the tevatron , resummation is quite significant for the @xmath20 channel . a similar figure for the @xmath21 channel",
    "may be found in our publications  @xcite .",
    "-0.9 cm    in fig .  2",
    ", we show our total cross section for @xmath0-production as a function of top mass in @xmath88 collisions at @xmath89 tev .",
    "the central value is obtained with the choice @xmath90 , and the lower and upper limits are the maximum and minimum of the cross section in the range @xmath81 . at @xmath37 175",
    "gev , the full width of the uncertainty band is about 10%  .",
    "we consider that the variation of the cross section over the range @xmath81 provides a good overall estimate of uncertainty . for comparison",
    ", we note that over the same range of @xmath13 , the strong coupling strength @xmath40 varies by @xmath91%  at @xmath12 = 175 gev . in estimating uncertainties",
    ", we do not consider explicit variations of the non - perturbative cutoff , expressed through @xmath92 .",
    "this is justified because , for a fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath92 is obtained by enforcing dominance of the universal leading logarithmic terms over the subleading ones .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 is _ derived _ and is not a source of uncertainty . at fixed @xmath12 ,",
    "the cutoff necessarily varies as @xmath13 and thus @xmath40 vary . using a different choice of parton densities  @xcite",
    ", we find a 4%  difference in the central value of our prediction  @xcite at @xmath37 175 gev .",
    "a comparison of the predictions  @xcite in the @xmath43 and dis factorization schemes also shows a modest difference at the level of @xmath93 .",
    "our calculation is in agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath94 . this cross section is larger than the next - to - leading order value by about @xmath95 .",
    "the top quark cross section increases quickly with the energy of the @xmath88 collider .",
    "we provide predictions in fig .  3 for an upgraded tevatron operating at @xmath96 tev .",
    "we determine @xmath97 .",
    "the central value rises to 22.4 pb at @xmath98 and 46 pb at @xmath99 .    extending our calculation to much larger values of @xmath12 at @xmath86 tev",
    ", we find that resummation in the principal @xmath20 channel produces enhancements over the next - to - leading order cross section of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , respectively , for @xmath37 500 , 600 , and 700 gev .",
    "the reason for the increase of the enhancements with mass at fixed energy is that the threshold region becomes increasingly dominant .",
    "since the @xmath20 channel also dominates in the production of hadronic jets at very large values of transverse momenta , we suggest that on the order of @xmath103 of the excess cross section reported by the cdf collaboration  @xcite may well be accounted for by resummation .    turning to @xmath104 scattering at the energies of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , we note a few significant differences from @xmath105 scattering at the energy of the tevatron .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath106 production channel is replaced by @xmath107 dominance at the lhc .",
    "owing to the much larger value of @xmath108 , the near - threshold region in the subenergy variable is relatively less important , reducing the significance of initial - state soft gluon radiation .",
    "lastly , physics in the region of large subenergy , where straightforward next - to - leading order qcd is also inadequate , becomes significant for @xmath0 production at lhc energies . using the approach described in this paper",
    ", we estimate @xmath109 760 pb .",
    "two other groups have published calculations of the total cross section at @xmath110 and @xmath111 : @xmath112(lsvn  @xcite ) = @xmath113 pb ; and @xmath112(cmnt  @xcite ) = @xmath114 pb . from the purely numerical point of view , all agree within their estimates of theoretical uncertainty . however , the resummation methods differ as do the methods for estimating uncertainties .",
    "both the central value and the band of uncertainty of the lsvn predictions are sensitive to their arbitrary infrared cutoffs .",
    "to estimate theoretical uncertainty , we use the standard @xmath13-variation , whereas lsvn obtain theirs primarily from variations of their cutoffs .",
    "the group of catani , mangano , nason , and trentadue ( cmnt )  @xcite calculate a central value of the resummed cross section ( also with @xmath115 ) that is less than @xmath116 above the exact next - to - leading order value .",
    "there are similarities and differences between our approach and the method of cmnt .",
    "we use the same universal leading - logarithm expression in moment space , but differences occur after the transformation to momentum space .",
    "the differences can be stated more explicitly if we examine the perturbative expansion of the resummed hard kernel @xmath117 .",
    "if , instead of restricting the resummation to the universal leading logarithms only , we were to use the full content of @xmath117 , we would arrive at an analytic expression that is equivalent to the numerical inversion of cmnt , @xmath118 + { \\cal o}(\\alpha^2 ) .",
    "\\label{padovao}\\ ] ] in terms of this expansion , in our work we retain only the leading term @xmath119 at order @xmath40 , but cmnt retain both this term and the subleading term @xmath120 . indeed , if the subleading term @xmath120 is discarded in eq .",
    "( [ padovao ] ) , the residuals @xmath121 defined by cmnt  @xcite increase from @xmath122 to @xmath123 in the @xmath20 production channel and from @xmath124 to @xmath125 in the @xmath21 channel .",
    "after addition of the two channels , the total residual @xmath126 grows from the negligible value of about @xmath127 cited by cmnt to the value @xmath128 . while still smaller than the increase of about @xmath95 that we obtain , the increase of @xmath128 vs. @xmath127 shows the substantial influence of the subleading logarithmic terms retained by cmnt .",
    "we judge that it is not appropriate to keep the subleading term for several reasons : it is not universal ; it is not the same as the subleading term in the exact @xmath129 calculation ; and it can be changed arbitrarily if one elects to keep non - leading terms in moment space .",
    "the subleading term is negative , and it is numerically very significant when integrated throughout the phase space . in the @xmath20 channel at @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 tev , its inclusion eliminates more than half of the contribution from the leading term . in our view , the presence of numerically significant subleading contributions begs the question of consistency .",
    "the influence of subleading terms is amplified at higher orders where additional subleading structures occur in the cmnt approach with significant numerical coefficients proportional to @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and so forth .",
    "we will present a more detailed discussion of these points elsewhere .    our theoretical analysis and the stability of our cross section under variation of the hard scale",
    "@xmath13 provide confidence that our perturbative resummation yields an accurate calculation of the inclusive top quark cross section at tevatron energies and exhausts present understanding of the perturbative content of the theory .",
