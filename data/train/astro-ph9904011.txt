    "stable mass transfer on to a ( compact ) accretor which is driven by the nuclear evolution of a giant is a process of considerable astrophysical interest .",
    "this type of evolution was first encountered in numerical simulations by ( among others ) kippenhahn , kohl & weigert ( 1967 ) and then studied in some detail by refsdal & weigert ( 1969 , 1971 ) in the context of the formation of low - mass white dwarfs in binaries .",
    "later webbink , rappaport & savonije ( 1983 , hereafter wrs ) and , independently , taam ( 1983 ) have proposed that some of the most luminous among the galactic low - mass x - ray binaries could be powered by nuclear time - scale driven mass transfer from a giant . finally with the detection of the millisecond pulsar binary psr 1953 + 29 by boriakoff , buccheri & fauci ( 1983 ) it became immediately clear that this system ( and many other similar ones which have been found since then ) must be the end product of an evolution of the type described by wrs and taam ( 1983 ) , see e.g. joss & rappaport ( 1983 ) , paczynski ( 1983 ) , savonije ( 1983 ) , and rappaport et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter rpjdh ) for a more recent reference .    whereas taam ( 1983 ) performed full stellar structure calculations wrs took a simpler approach by making use of the well - known fact that giants obey a core mass - luminosity and a core mass - radius relation .",
    "wrs derived these relations from full stellar equilibrium models of giants and approximated them as power series of the mass of the degenerate helium core @xmath0 . by using the core mass - luminosity and core mass - radius relation calculating the evolution of a binary with nuclear time - scale driven mass transfer from a giant reduces to preforming a simple integral in time which , however , in the approach taken by wrs has still to be performed numerically .",
    "the purpose of this paper is first to show that the evolution of such a binary can be described by an analytical solution if the core mass - luminosity and core mass - radius relation are simple power laws of @xmath0 , and second to show that the results of full stellar structure calculations of giants given by wrs can indeed be approximated with little loss of accuracy by simple power laws .",
    "moreover , the analytical solutions which we present are more general than the numerical ones of wrs in the sense that we allow for non - conservative mass transfer and a non - zero mass radius exponent of the donor star ( see below section [ sect3 ] ) .",
    "the advantages of having an analytical solution as compared to a numerical one are immediatedly clear : first , if sufficiently simple ( as in our case ) , such solutions provide us with direct physical insight into how this type of evolution works , i.e. which parameters determine the characteristc properties and which ones are of minor importance . second , whereas a numerical solution has to be computed separately for each set of input parameters of interest , an analytical solution provides us with the whole manifold of solutions , i.e. we get the explicit dependence of the solution on the input parameters . among other things ,",
    "this allows us to examine whether certain properties found in numerical solutions are generic or a simple consequence of a particular choice of parameters . a case in point",
    "is the well - known property of the solutions presented by wrs , namely that the mass transfer rate stays almost constant over most of the mass transfer phase .",
    "another area of application in which simple analytical solutions are superior to numerical ones is population synthesis .",
    "this is because population synthesis calculations usually involve integrals over the complete manifold of solutions of the particular evolutionary phase under consideration .",
    "using numerical solutions for that task requires computation of a sufficiently dense grid of evolutions over a multi - dimensional parameter space and such computations can easily become prohibitively expensive ( see e.g. kolb 1993 for a detailed discussion in the context of cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "using analytical solutions instead is comparatively easy and cheap .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect2 ] we present the basic model assumptions in the framework of which we shall work , in section [ sect3 ] we give an analytical solution for the nuclear evolution of a giant , and in section [ sect4 ] we derive expressions for the mass radius exponent of the donor star s critical roche radius .",
    "finally , in section [ sect5 ] we present the analytical solution for nuclear time - scale driven mass transfer from a giant . in order to compare our results with those of wrs we derive in section [ sect6 ] the parameters of the power law approximations of the core mass - luminosity and core mass - radius relations using the data from wrs and rpjdh . in section [ sect7 ]",
    "we then compare the results obtained from the analytical solutions with the corresponding numerical ones of wrs . in section [ sect8 ]",
    "we examine whether the model is selfconsistent and whether it is applicable to low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "a discussion based on the analytical solution of the key features of nuclear time - scale driven mass transfer from a giant follows in section [ sect9 ] , and our main conclusions are summarized in the final section [ sect10 ] .",
    "in the following we shall list the basic model assumptions in the framework of which we shall work .",
    "these assumptions are :    1 .",
    "the donor star ( of mass @xmath1 ) is on the first giant branch and has a degenerate helium core of mass @xmath0 .",
    "nuclear luminosity comes from hydrogen shell burning exclusively .",
    "2 .   @xmath1 is small enough that the binary is adiabatically and thermally stable against mass transfer . for this to hold we must have ( e.g. ritter 1988 ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the adiabatic mass radius exponent of the donor star , @xmath5 the corresponding thermal equilibrium mass radius exponent , and @xmath6 the mass radius exponent of its critical roche radius ( see e.g. ritter 1996 for details ) . in ( [",
    "2.5 ] ) the subscript @xmath7 indicates that for computing this quantity one has to specify how , as a consequence of mass transfer , mass and orbital angular momentum are lost from and redistributed within the binary system ( see below section [ sect4 ] ) . + for stars on the first giant branch and with small relative core mass @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 increases with relative core mass and becomes positive if @xmath11 ( hjellming & webbink 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , as we shall see , adiabatic stability of mass transfer is less critical than thermal stability .",
    "+ assuming that the donor obeys a core mass - luminosity relation , i.e. that @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ( nuclear ) luminosity , @xmath15 follows from the stefan  boltzmann law : @xmath16 it is well known that a giant , as long as it has a sufficiently deep outer convective envelope , in the hrd stays close to and evolves along the hayashi line to higher luminosity .",
    "this property allows us to get an approximation for @xmath15 . approximating the hayashi line in the hrd in the form ( e.g. kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) @xmath17 this together with ( [ 2.6 ] ) yields @xmath18 numerical calculations typically yield @xmath19 .",
    "thus , except for small relative core mass , @xmath20 , i.e. the criterion for thermal stability ( [ 2.2 ] ) against mass transfer is stronger than the one for adiabatic stability ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "mass transfer is driven only by the donor s nuclear evolution , i.e. we assume that there is no systemic angular momentum loss in the absence of mass transfer .",
    "consequential angular momentum loss ( see e.g. king & kolb 1995 for a discussion ) is , however , not excluded a priori .",
    "mass transfer is so slow that the donor star remains close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "accordingly we assume that its radius @xmath21 and luminosity @xmath22 are given by the corresponding thermal equlilibrium values , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and hence @xmath25 .",
    "this condition is well fulfilled because mass transfer occurs on the nuclear time scale @xmath26 which is much longer than the kelvin - helmholtz time @xmath27 .",
    "we shall later ( section [ sect8 ] ) verify the validity of this assumption .    with the above assumptions we can now write the mass transfer rate , i.e. the donor s mass loss rate as ( e.g. ritter 1996 ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the inverse time - scale of the donor s expansion due to nuclear evolution .",
    "next we shall work out in more detail @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "here we are going to exploit the fact that to a very good approximation the luminosity @xmath14 of a star on the first giant branch scales as a simple power law of the mass @xmath0 of the degenerate helium core but does not depend on its total mass ( refsdal & weigert 1970 ) .",
    "accordingly we make the following ansatz for @xmath14 : @xmath32 it then follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) that the radius of such a star can not at the same time depend only on the core mass @xmath0 but must also depend on its total mass @xmath33 . because along the hayashi line the effective temperature remains almost constant it follows from ( [ 3.1 ] ) and the stefan  boltzmann law that the appropriate form of the ` core mass - radius relation ' is @xmath34 here , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are parameters which have to be determined from full numerical calculations .",
    "we shall give examples ( taken form wrs and rpjdh ) in section [ sect6 ] .",
    "using homology techniques refsdal & weigert ( 1970 ) could derive an expression for @xmath36 , the numerical value of which depends on the conditions in the hydrogen shell source . a typical value for pop .",
    "i giants is @xmath39 .",
    "hydrogen burning in the shell source around the degenerate core adds to the core mass at a rate @xmath40 . thereby the nuclear luminosity generated is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hydrogen mass fraction in the star s envelope and @xmath43 erg g@xmath44 the net energy yield of hydrogen burning per unit mass . in writing ( [ 3.3 ] ) we have assumed that the star is in thermal equilibrium , i.e. that @xmath45 or , for practical purposes , that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the gravo - thermal luminosity .",
    "( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) together yield a simple differential equation for @xmath48 with the solution @xmath49 where @xmath50}^{1-\\lambda } \\label{3.5}\\ ] ] is the time over which , formally , the core mass reaches infinity .",
    "it is also the characteristic time for nuclear evolution on the first giant branch .",

    "this quantity has also to be taken from full stellar evolution calculations or to be treated as a free parameter .    from ( [ 3.7 ] ) we finally obtain @xmath54 the expression to be inserted in ( [ 2.9 ] ) .",
    "here we follow standard arguments which have been given many times in the literature ( e.g. soberman , phinney & van den heuvel 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we shall give here only the definitions we use and the final results .",
    "in the context of this paper , we assume that mass transfer occurs from the secondary and that the primary ( of mass @xmath55 ) accretes ( on average ) a fraction @xmath56 of the transferred mass , i.e. @xmath57 and that the mass @xmath58 leaves the binary system carrying away the orbital angular momentum @xmath59 where , for the moment at least , @xmath56 and @xmath60 are free parameters , @xmath61 is the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath62 the orbital separation .",
    "writing for the secondary s critical roche radius @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass ratio , one derives @xmath65 with @xmath66 as a further simplification we use for @xmath67 in ( [ 4.4 ] ) and ( [ 4.7 ] ) the approximation ( paczynski 1971 ) @xmath68 which yields @xmath69 inserting ( [ 4.9 ] ) in ( [ 4.6 ] ) finally yields @xmath70 in the following we shall also give the results for two specific choices of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath60 :      here @xmath71 and @xmath72 . from ( [ 4.6 ] ) and ( [ 4.9 ] ) we then have @xmath73      here we are considering the case that all the transferred mass is ejected from the primary in an isotropic stellar wind carrying with it the specific orbital angular momentum of the primary .",
    "accordingly @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "now that we have determined @xmath77 and @xmath31 in equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) we can solve that equation .",
    "first we are going to give a rather general solution before discussing special cases of interest .",
    "general solution in this context means that we allow for a constant value @xmath78 , either a constant value of @xmath79 or @xmath80 , and a constant value of @xmath15 subject to the condition ( [ 2.2 ] ) . inserting ( [ 3.8 ] ) and",

    "the solutions are completely fixed by the parameters of the core mass - luminosity relation ( [ 3.1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the ` core mass - radius relation ' ( [ 3.2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath15 , the initial values and the current values of both masses and the secondary s core mass .",

    "note that the resulting equation for @xmath103 can not in general be solved in closed form .",
    "reinserting the solution of this equation in ( [ 5.2 ] ) finally yields also @xmath102 .",
    "table 1 lists the powers @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 which appear in equations ( [ 5.2 ] )  ( [ 5.6 ] ) for a number of special cases of interest .",

    "cases 4 and 5 correspond to conservative mass transfer with respectively @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "case 6 finally corresponds to case 3 with @xmath109 .",
    "case 3 ( or 6 ) corresponds to the situation in which the accretor ejects all the transferred mass with the specific orbital angular momentum of the accretor s orbit .",
    "this approximates what apparently must happen in systems in which the mass transfer rate to a neutron star exceeds the eddington accretion rate by many orders of magnitude ( see e.g. king & ritter 1999 for a discussion ) .",
    "we shall later mostly make use of case 5 because this is the approximation within which wrs have performed their numerical calculations and with which we wish to compare the results of our analytical solution . before we can do that we have to provide the parameters describing the core mass - luminosity and core mass - radius relation .

    "results of detailed numerical computations by wrs are shown in their figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "comparing the results obtained from our analytical solution for the same parameters with those of wrs shows that the differences are small , too small in fact to be adequately shown on the scale of these figures .",
    "that the differences in @xmath113 and @xmath114 are small was to be expected based on the quality of the fits used ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) . that the differences in @xmath115 are small too is shown in figs",
    "3 and 4 . in that context",
    "we should emphasize that our fits of the @xmath116 and @xmath117 relations of wrs with power laws are the simplest possible ones ( with integer powers @xmath36 and @xmath38 ) and that no attempt has been made to adjust the power law parameters such as to minimize the differences between the numerical results of wrs and the analytical solution . with @xmath115 being in close agreement with the numerical results it follows that also @xmath118 and @xmath119 should agree very well , which is indeed the case .",
    "finally also @xmath48 must be in close agreement with the numerical result of wrs , otherwise the temporal evolution of the other quantities would not match either .",
    "= 1.0    = 1.0    in fact we can summarize the result of this comparison as follows : if the power law fits to the core mass - luminosity and core mass - radius relations obtained from full stellar structure calculations are adequate , the analytical model provides an adequate approximation to the results of numerical computations .",
    "the equations we have derived in section [ sect5 ] are valid only to the extent that the donor star is not significantly driven out of thermal equilibrium as a consequence of mass loss .",
    "that is to say that the time - scale of mass loss @xmath120 must be significantly longer than the shortest time - scale on which the donor s convective envelope can react , i.e. longer than the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time of the convective envelope ( e.g. king et al .",
    "1997a ) @xmath121 here @xmath122 is the mass of the convective envelope and @xmath123 the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time of the whole star .",
    "a measure for the star s deviation from thermal equilibrium is thus the the ratio @xmath124 . using equations ( [ 2.9 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] )  ( [ 3.8 ] ) in ( [ 8.1 ] ) and ( [ 8.2 ] ) we can now write @xmath125 and @xmath126 and , therefore , @xmath127 inserting now for illustrative puposes the parameters of table 2 which correspond to the results of wrs into ( [ 8.6 ] ) yields @xmath128 for pop . i , and @xmath129 for pop .",
    "ii chemical composition .",
    "what ( [ 8.6 ] )  ( [ 8.8 ] ) demonstrate is that for all practical purposes @xmath130 unless the mass ratio is such that the binary system is close to thermal instability , i.e. that @xmath131 .",
    "thus mass transfer driven by nuclear evolution of a star on the first giant branch is always sufficiently slow for the donor star to remain essentially in thermal equilibrium . to this extent ,",
    "the analytical model presented in section [ sect5 ] is selfconsistent .",
    "since one of the main areas of application of this model is the evolution of luminous x - ray binaries ( see e.g. taam 1983 and wrs ) and their transformation into millisecond pulsar binaries ( see e.g. rpjdh and references therein ) we have to examine whether this model remains applicable if irradiation of the cool donor star by x - rays from the vicinity of a very compact accretor is taken into account . as has first been shown by podsiadlowski ( 1991 ) cool stars , when exposed to sufficiently strong external heating by x - rays , respond by expansion on the thermal time - scale of the convective envelope , thereby giving rise to very high mass transfer rates in a semi - detached binary . in the context of mass transfer from a giant to a compact accretor the stability of mass transfer with taking into account irradiation has been examined in some detail by king et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "their finding was that if the accretion rate on to the compact star equals the mass transfer rate at any time , the evolutionary model discussed here is not in general applicable , because mass transfer is very likely to be unstable .",
    "rather than being continuous , mass transfer occurs in cycles which are characterized by short high states during which very high mass transfer rates are achieved and long low states during which the binary is detached . as has been shown by king et al .",
    "( 1997a ) this instability occurs mainly because for giants the ratio of mass loss time - scale to kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time ( equation [ 8.6 ] ) is so large .",
    "it is therefore somewhat ironic that self - consistency of the model of nuclear time - scale driven stationary mass transfer from a giant is possible only at the price that such systems are in danger of being unstable to irradiation - driven mass transfer .",
    "however , the above - mentioned condition , namely that the accretion rate equals the mass transfer rate at any time , is not likely to be fulfilled .",
    "rather , as has been shown by king et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , the accretion disc in such binary systems is likely to be unstable and that even for the rather optimistic assumptions made by king et al .",
    "( 1997b ) about the efficiency of x - ray irradiation of the accretion disc . based on newer results of dubus et al .",
    "( 1998 ) one could conclude that the accretion discs in essentially all systems with a giant donor are unstable .",
    "if this is the case , then accretion on to the compact star is spasmodic because the disc undergoes a dwarf nova - like limit - cycle instability . estimates of the properties of the outbursts ( e.g. king & ritter 1998 ) show that they are characterized by a very small duty cycle .",
    "this , in turn , is now of great importance for the stability of mass transfer from the giant in the presence of x - ray irradiation : king et al .",
    "( 1997a ) show that if accretion on to a neutron star or a black hole is spasmodic with a small duty cycle , then mass transfer from the giant is stable despite the donor being irradiated .",
    "if that is the case , the model considered by taam ( 1993 ) , wrs and us is applicable .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the accretor is a white dwarf the situation is more complicated : if the core mass of the donor is @xmath132 , irradiation can not destabilize mass transfer and , therefore , the model is applicable . yet",
    "if @xmath133 , mass transfer is unstable .",
    "although spasmodic accretion has a stabilizing effect , for mass transfer to become stable in this case the required small duty cycle has to be smaller still by a factor of @xmath134 than in the case of a black hole or a neutron star ( see king et al .",
    "1997a , fig .",
    "because the value of the duty cycle does not depend explicitely on the nature of the accretor but rather on the average mass transfer rate and on the size of the accretion disc , it appears unlikely that the duty cycle in a white dwarf system is systematically smaller than in a black hole or neutron star system .",
    "therefore it is more likely that in a white dwarf system in which @xmath133 mass transfer is unstable despite spasmodic accretion . in this case",
    "the model in question is not applicable .",
    "however , we should emphasize that detailed numerical calculations of mass transfer from a giant with taking into account the effects of irradiation of the donor star and of disc instabilites have yet to be done .",
    "before results of such computations are available , a final decision about whether this model is applicable can not be made .",
    "having established that the analytical approximation is both accurate and selfconsistent , and that the model is probably also applicable to the most important case of interest , i.e. to low - mass x - ray binaries , we can now proceed to discuss the properties of these solutions .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of this type of evolution which has already been pointed out by wrs is that the mass transfer rate remains almost constant for most of the mass transfer phase .",
    "here we shall examine whether this is a generic property of mass transfer from a giant or whether this is due to a particular choice of parameters .",
    "other aspects which we wish examine are the dependence of the temporal evolution on the initial parameters , in particular on the initial core mass @xmath95 , and systematic differences between pop .",
    "i and pop .",
    "ii systems .",
    "= 0.5      one of the remarkable properties of the evolutions shown by wrs in their figs . 3 and 4",
    "( see also our figs . 3 and 4 )",
    "is that the mass transfer rate remains constant within a small factor ( @xmath135 ) in the case of conservative mass transfer , and , as fig .",
    "5 shows , within an even smaller factor ( @xmath136 ) in the case that @xmath107 and @xmath105 throughout the evolution .",
    "this raises the question why this is so and whether this is a generic property of this type of evolution . for our discussion",
    "we combine ( [ 2.9 ] ) and ( [ 3.8 ] ) to write the mass transfer rate as @xmath137 from ( [ 9.1 ] ) it is immediately seen , that it contains two counteracting factors : first , with time @xmath138 increases because q increases .",
    "this factor has thus the tendency to reduce @xmath115 with time . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath139 decreases with time and thus has the tendency to increase @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that @xmath115 goes through a minimum during an evolution .",
    "yet , an evolution does not necessarily include this minimum . rather , whether or not @xmath141 has a minimum depends on the initial mass ratio @xmath142 and on the subsequent change of @xmath143 with time .",
    "starting from equations ( [ 5.2 ] ) and ( [ 5.3 ] ) and working out @xmath144 leads to a ( rather complicated ) equation for the mass ratio @xmath145 at which @xmath115 becomes extremal . from the above discussion",
    "we know already that this extremum is a minimum . denoting the final mass ratio by @xmath146 , we can now distinguish three different cases : 1 ) if @xmath147 then the mass transfer rate goes through a minimum , 2 ) if @xmath148 , the mass transfer rate will increase monotonically , and if 3 ) @xmath149 , the mass transfer rate will decrease monotonically . here",
    "@xmath150 is the critical mass ratio for both thermal and adiabatic stability against mass transfer .",
    "its value is given by the larger of the positive solutions of the equations @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( see e.g. ritter 1988 ) .",
    "for illustrative purposes we give the values of @xmath150 and @xmath145 for the cases we show in figs .",
    "3  5 . for these cases",
    "we have assumed with wrs @xmath109 and implicitly @xmath153 . from this and ( [ 4.12 ] ) it follows that @xmath154 in the case of conservative mass transfer , and with ( [ 4.14 ] ) that @xmath155 in the case where @xmath107 and @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath145 are in the case of conservative mass transfer @xmath156 for pop .",
    "i giants ( with parameters taken from table 2 ) and @xmath157 for pop .",
    "ii giants .",
    "in fact for all combinations @xmath158 which describe the evolution of giants adequately we find @xmath159 . in the case of non - conservative mass transfer with @xmath107 and @xmath105",
    "we find @xmath160 for pop .",
    "i giants and @xmath161 for pop .",
    "ii giants , again with parameters taken from table 2 , and an upper limit of @xmath162 for all acceptable combinations of @xmath158 .    from the foregoing it is now clear that the near constancy of the mass transfer rate in the evolutions considered by wrs is not a generic property .",
    "rather it is the result of a particular choice of initial parameters . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath163 is close to ( but larger than ) @xmath150 the mass transfer rate initially drops very strongly . on the other hand , the larger @xmath164 the more strongly the mass transfer rate increases beyond @xmath145 . because conservative mass transfer results in the largest possible values of @xmath164 we expect the mass transfer rate to increase substantially beyond @xmath145 and that in particular if the initial mass of the primary is already much larger than that of the donor star .",
    "this is e.g. the case if the accretor is a black hole rather than a neutron star . to illustrate this we show in fig .",
    "5 the run of @xmath115 in a conservative mass transfer with @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "it is clearly seen how the mass transfer rate grows because of the high final mass ratio of @xmath168 .",
    "nevertheless , the mass transfer rate stays reasonably constant if @xmath163 is not close to @xmath150 and the accretor is a neutron star , i.e. @xmath169 .",
    "this is the case for the simulations shown by wrs .    on the other hand , in the case that @xmath107 and @xmath105 the variation of the mass transfer rate is systematically smaller , first because for the same @xmath163 mass transfer is more stable than in the conservative case , and second because @xmath55 remains constant , thus resulting in systematically lower values of @xmath164",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 where we show the run of @xmath115 for the same initial parameters as for the conservative evolutions shown in figs . 3 and 4 , but now with @xmath107 and @xmath105 .",
    "as can be seen , the mass transfer varies much less than in the conservative case .      as can be seen from equation ( [ 5.3 ] ) , apart from the variation of the mass transfer rate during a mass transfer phase discussed in section [ sect9.1 ] , the level of mass transfer is set by the initial core mass @xmath95 and depends on a large power , i.e. @xmath170 , of it . using the parameters given in table 2 which correspond to the results of wrs we have respectively @xmath171 and @xmath172 for pop .",
    "i and pop .",
    "ii giants ( see equations ( [ 7.1 ] ) and ( [ 7.2 ] ) ) .",
    "this strong dependence on @xmath95 is a direct consequence of the strong dependence of the stellar luminosity on @xmath95 ( see equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) ) .",
    "also the stellar radius shows a strong dependence on @xmath95 as can be seen from equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the initial core mass is the single most important parameter characterizing the evolution of a binary with mass transfer from a giant .",
    "we have already discussed the possible influence of @xmath15 on the value of @xmath150 in section [ sect9.1 ] . however , as table 1 shows , the analytical solutions ( [ 5.2 ] )  ( [ 5.6 ] ) depend on @xmath15 also via the exponent @xmath87 .",
    "going from a solution with @xmath109 to one with @xmath173 changes @xmath87 by @xmath174 .",
    "thus , with the parameters from table 2 which correspond to the results of wrs we have @xmath175 for pop .",
    "i , and @xmath176 for pop .",
    "ii chemical composition . taking for an estimate @xmath177",
    "we find that for both cases , i.e. pop .",
    "i and pop .",
    "ii , @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , apart from increasing @xmath150 , going from @xmath109 to @xmath179 leads to an increase of the mass transfer rate via the increased factor @xmath180 and to a decrease by the factor @xmath181 . sufficiently far from the stability limit , i.e. from @xmath150 , it is the latter factor which dominates . because @xmath182 this factor is never very small . for all practical purposes",
    "we find it to be between @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "thus , qualitatively , the main effect of going from @xmath109 to @xmath179 is to increase @xmath150 and therefore to reduce the maximum allowed value for the initial secondary mass .      because for pop .",
    "ii giants @xmath35 , @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 are significantly smaller than for pop .",
    "i giants ( see table 2 ) , the evolution of a pop .",
    "ii system , all other parameters being the same , is significantly slower than that of a pop .",
    "i system if @xmath185 . from equation ( [ 5.3 ] ) it follows that the differential evolutionary speed scales as @xmath186 , i.e. using the parameters of table 2 which correspond to the results of wrs , as @xmath187 . for an initial core mass of @xmath188 and @xmath189 the evolution of a pop .",
    "ii system is thus slower by respectively a factor of about 3 and 8 .",
    "furthermore , because pop .",
    "ii giants are also smaller than pop .",
    "i giants if @xmath133 the orbital period of a pop .",
    "ii binary is shorter too by a corresponding factor of about @xmath190 than that of a comparable pop .",
    "we have shown that the evolution of a binary with stable mass transfer from a giant donor can be described by a simple analytical solution ( see section [ sect5 ] ) if the core mass - luminosity and core mass - radius relation are simple power laws of the mass of the degenerate helium core @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that the results of full stellar structure calculations of giants given by wrs and others can indeed be approximated with little loss of accuracy by simple power laws ( section [ sect6 ] ) and that , therefore , the analytical solutions derived here are relevant for the cases studied by taam ( 1983 ) and wrs and similar cases . moreover , the analytical solutions which we have derived are more general than the numerical ones of wrs in the sense that we allow for non - conservative mass transfer and a non - zero mass radius exponent @xmath15 .",
    "a direct comparison of the results obtained from the analytical solution with those of numerical calculations by wrs ( section [ sect7 ] ) shows that both the analytical solution and the power law approximations are quite accurate ( see figs . 1  4 ) .    using the analytical solution we have also made an a posteriori check of whether one of the key assumptions made in this model is fulfilled , namely that the donor star remains near thermal equilibrium despite being subject to mass loss ( section [ sect8.1 ] ) , and",
    "have found that this is indeed the case . in section [ sect8.2 ]",
    "we put forward arguments , why , despite strong irradiation of the donor star from a compact accretor , the model is probably applicable to low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "furthermore we have seen ( section [ sect9.1 ] ) that the near constancy of the mass transfer rate over most of the mass transfer phase seen in the results by wrs is not a generic feature of this type of evolution but rather a consequence of a particular choice of parameters . in particular , we found considerable variation of the mass transfer rate if the final mass ratio @xmath164 gets large",
    ". therefore , particularly in conservative evolutions in which the accretor is massive , e.g. a black hole , the mass transfer rate increases quite substantially towards the end of the mass transfer phase ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . on the other hand , in evolutions",
    "in which the mass of the accretor remains constant or nearly so , @xmath164 gets much less extreme and as a consequence of that the mass transfer rate varies to a much lesser degree .    from the analytical solution ( [ 5.3 ] ) it is also directly seen that the level of mass transfer is largely set by @xmath95 , the core mass at the _ onset _ of mass transfer .",
