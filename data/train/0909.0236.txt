    "multiplicative groups defined by finite fields @xmath7 are of first importance in numerous applications , especially in discrete - log based public key cryptography . in this field , diffie and hellman s seminal paper  @xcite opened the way to their use in numerous cryptographic standards in the eighties .",
    "it turns out that elliptic curves are often prefered today , since there exist subexponential algorithms to solve the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields  @xcite . but",
    "@xmath7-subgroups of order @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the @xmath1-th cyclotomic polynomial ( the minimal polynomial over @xmath10 of @xmath11 ) , has reattracted attention since the publication of lenstra and verheul s xtr scheme in 2000  @xcite .",
    "lenstra and verheul noticed that in the very particular case @xmath12 , working in the @xmath13-subgroup of order @xmath14 can be done with a @xmath15 arithmetic , whereas the best way to break the system remains to solve discrete logarithms problems in @xmath13 . certainly , this yields reasonably competitive implementations .",
    "but the most surprising is that xtr subgroups are , up to symmetry , generated by the relative trace @xmath16 . as a consequence",
    ", we can encode them with only two elements of @xmath5 , with time complexity equal to @xmath17 elementary operations .    in this paper ,",
    "we exhibit for @xmath18 , @xmath1 fixed , encodings that can be computed very efficiently , that is with @xmath17 bit operations too .",
    "to this purpose , we start from the interpretation of xtr - subgroups as algebraic tori , due to rubin and silverberg  @xcite , and the explicit encoding proposed by van dijk and woodruff  @xcite .",
    "algebraic tori over @xmath5 are algebraic groups defined over @xmath5 that are isomorphic to some @xmath19 over @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the multiplicative group and @xmath22 is the dimension of the torus .",
    "algebraic tori involved here are @xmath23 these are algebraic varieties of dimension @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the euler - totient function .",
    "it turns out that in terms of group , @xmath26 is a subgroup of order @xmath8 , that is @xmath27 an efficient rational parameterization of these tori with @xmath4-tuples instead of @xmath1-tuples would thus allow the same security as in @xmath7 , but a reduced communication cost .",
    "even though practical constructions exist for particular values of @xmath1 ( for instance , 2 , 3 or 6 with luc  @xcite , xtr@xcite or ceilidh@xcite ) , the rationality or stable rationality of such structures for every @xmath1 has been a concern for several years now  @xcite .",
    "a nice workaround proposed by van dijk and woodruff  @xcite consists in adding to the torus @xmath28 some well chosen finite fields and mapping the whole set into another product of finite fields , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the moebius function .",
    "this bijection enables to compactly represent @xmath3 elements of @xmath26 with roughly @xmath31 elements in @xmath5 for large enough @xmath3 . for well chosen @xmath2 and @xmath1 ,",
    "mainly @xmath1 a product of distinct primes and @xmath2 of maximal order modulo these primes , evaluating @xmath32 requires at least @xmath33 elementary operations .    in the present work",
    ", we observe that the heaviest part of the complexity comes from exponentiations in @xmath34 to powers with sparse decomposition in basis @xmath2 and we succeed in speeding up the algorithm with the help of a new representation of field extensions .",
    "couveignes and lercier recently constructed a new family of normal bases , called normal elliptic bases  @xcite .",
    "they allow to perform low cost arithmetic in @xmath34 and in the context of tori this yields encodings with a @xmath6 smaller computational cost . in order to reach this complexity ,",
    "we need inputs @xmath2 and @xmath1 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are relatively prime for any distinct divisors @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath1 .",
    "this is not a big restriction in applications , since there are infinitely many @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that this condition holds .",
    "it is worth to notice that the encoding cost becomes negligible in regard of the major cost in many diffie - hellman cryptosystems , @xmath39 bit operations , due to exponentiations in @xmath34 .",
    "this is particularly interesting since in cryptographic applications @xmath2 tends to be a large number and @xmath1 rather small .",
    "we may also remark that these ideas can be easily adapted to the improved variant of @xmath32 introduced by dijk _",
    "et al . _ in 2005  @xcite .",
    "they substitute tori of small dimensions for the finite fields @xmath40 in eq .  , but all the calculations still take place in @xmath34 and can be sped up thanks to normal elliptic bases .",
    "* outline . * in section  [ sec : algebraic - tori ] , we present some background materials about algebraic tori encodings .",
    "section  [ sec : ellipt - peri - algebr ] outlines some nice cyclotomic properties of these algorithms and shows how the use of a normal elliptic basis can yield a @xmath6 speedup .",
    "section  [ sec : crypt - appl ] discusses some of the cryptographic applications of these mappings .",
    "van dijk and woodruff first proposed an algorithmic way to encode efficiently a torus @xmath26 , modulo some small constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we start from the embedding @xmath41 and we complete both sides with the missing parts in order to create a bijection .    from @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 . van dijk and woodruff",
    "first add the product @xmath44 to the left hand side of the embedding .",
    "then , they identify factors of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 in this expression . at this step",
    ", we may have to add some newer tori , of smaller dimension . as a result",
    ", this will modify the right hand side too .",
    "but again , we identify there factors of the form @xmath45 . after enough such iterations ,",
    "this yields a bijection @xmath32 ( _ cf . _",
    "eq .  ) .",
    "the domain of this bijection is much larger than @xmath26 , but in the case where we have @xmath3 elements of @xmath26 to encode , we can nevertheless recover a quasi optimal encoding rate .",
    "we refer to section  [ sec : key - agreement ] for details .",
    "* example .",
    "* let us see how it works for @xmath47 .",
    "we have @xmath48 so , @xmath49 , hence the bijection @xmath50 since @xmath51 let us remark that there is no guarantee that the @xmath52 s are coprime , and thus this bijection may not be a group isomorphism .",
    "we now show how we can explicitly construct the bijection @xmath32 .",
    "we can obtain its inverse in the same way , but for the sake of simplicity , we omit details .    for all @xmath46 , call @xmath53 the smallest positive integer such that @xmath54 for @xmath55 , let furthermore @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath58 . let finally @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 be the coefficients in bzout s relations @xmath63 with the notations above , we have the following bijections , for all @xmath46 , @xmath64 these two successive bijections give a full decomposition of each @xmath40 into @xmath65    the first bijection is a canonical bijection given by the chinese remainder theorem , whereas the second one is non - canonical and can be performed by a table lookup .",
    "van dijk and woodruff have proved that these tables are of reasonable size when some technical conditions are satisfied by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , mainly @xmath1 being a product of distinct primes and @xmath2 of maximal order modulo these primes",
    ".    the idea is now to give a decomposition of both sides of the bijection @xmath32 and to identify the small groups on each sides .",
    "the same groups appear in a different order , except @xmath26 which is mapped into @xmath66 .",
