    "topological defects are generic in nature and may be formed whenever a phase transition occurs . in an expanding universe cooling down from a very hot initial state",
    "it is to be expected that topological defects may provide a unique window onto the physics of the early universe offering perhaps the best hope of a clear observable link between cosmology and particle physics @xcite .",
    "most cosmological studies of cosmic defects have focused on cosmic strings due to their interesting properties and strong motivation from fundamental physics ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . although standard cosmic strings are now ruled out as the sole contribution to the large scale structure of the universe @xcite they may still be the dominant source of perturbations on small cosmological scales and may give rise to a number of interesting cosmological consequences @xcite .",
    "however , at present there are only two observations for which cosmic strings seem to offer the most natural explanation @xcite .",
    "domain wall scenarios have attracted less attention since heavy domain walls in a linear scaling regime rapidly dominate the energy density of the universe . moreover , domain walls which are light enough to satisfy current cmb constraints have a negligible direct contribution to structure formation . however , in this case a number of interesting consequences are possible such as a contribution to the dark energy @xcite ( if domain walls are frozen in comoving coordinates ) and a small but measurable contribution to the cmb anisotropies at large angular scales @xcite .",
    "domain walls may also separate regions in the universe with different values of the cosmological parameters and/or fundamental constants of nature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a quantitative study of the cosmological evolution of domain wall networks .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the uncertainty in key parameters characterising the evolution of the network on the size , dynamical range and number of spatial dimensions of the simulations using a simple analytic model .",
    "we then compare our analytic predictions with the results of a large set of high - resolution simulations of domain walls in two and three spatial dimensions @xcite , using the standard press - ryden - spergel ( prs ) algorithm @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and discuss the evidence from the simulations of a slow approach towards a linear scaling regime .",
    "previous studies of domain wall network evolution @xcite having a smaller number of simulations with smaller size and dynamical range than the present one have found some hints for deviations from a scale - invariant evolution .",
    "it is therefore crucial to investigate if these are only transitory or if there is a more fundamental reason for such deviations .",
    "the present article is a follow - up of @xcite .",
    "there , we concentrated on the overall ( global ) dynamical features of the simulations . on the other hand , having a large dynamic range means that a more localised analysis is also possible , and in particular local exponents can be calculated with relatively small errors . in the present paper",
    "we explore this possiblity , and also make use of the large number of simulations to discuss some analytic ways to estimate statistical errors .",
    "we study the evolution of a domain wall network in a flat homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . we consider a scalar field @xmath0 with the lagrangian density @xmath1 and we will take @xmath2 to be the generic @xmath3 potential with two degenerate minima given by @xmath4 which obviously admits domain wall solutions .",
    "following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite we modified the equations of motion in such a way that the co - moving thickness of the domain walls is fixed in co - moving coordinates allowing us to resolve the domain walls throughout the full dynamical range of the simulations . with this modification implemented the equations of motion for the field @xmath0 become : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scale factor , @xmath7 is the conformal time and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants .",
    "we take @xmath10 in order to have constant co - moving thickness and @xmath11 to ensure that the momentum conservation law of the wall evolution in an expanding universe is maintained @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ dynamics2 ] ) is then integrated using a standard finite - difference scheme .",
    "we have verified that the prs alghoritm gives the correct results in some special cases such as the dynamics of a plane wall or the collapse of a spherical or cilindrical domain wall .",
    "we have also verified that it appears to have a small impact on the large - scale dynamics of domain wall networks and does not seem to affect the quantities we want to measure for the purpose of testing scaling properties provided a minimum acceptable tickness is used . however , it is only possible to test the performance of the prs alghoritm over a narrow window since the ` true ' equation of motions for the domain walls rapidly make the wall thickness smaller than the grid size .",
    "in addition to these simple tests with domain walls , the prs algorithm has been much more extensively used and tested in the case of cosmic strings ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from those one can infer that with the use of the prs algorithm some quantitative features of the networks will indeed differ ( for example , the distribution of small - scale features on the networks ) , but",
    "the broad features will be largely unchanged .",
    "an example of the latter is the existence of an attractor scaling solution , and how fast it is reached starting from some given initial configuration . since this is the issue we are studying here , we believe that the prs algorithm is adequate for our purposes .    the ratio between the kinetic and potential energy of the domain walls is approximately given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total co - moving area of the domain walls determined using the algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite and we are measuring length in units of the grid spacing @xmath14 ( so that @xmath15 ) . this quantity is related to the root - mean squared velocity of the domain walls which should be conserved in a linear scaling regime .",
    "we assume the initial value of @xmath0 to be a random variable between @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the initial value of @xmath18 to be zero .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion of these and other issues .",
    "we consider a simple model for the evolution of the uncertainty in key parameters characterising the evolution of a domain wall network which we then test against domain wall network simulations .",
    "let us define the comoving correlation length of the network as @xmath19 .",
    "consider a cubic grid in @xmath20 dimensions where each cube of comoving volume @xmath21 has @xmath20 faces of its own .",
    "note that the number of faces of a cube in @xmath20 dimensions is @xmath22 but each one of them belongs to two adjacent cubes so that in practise each cube has @xmath20 faces of its own .",
    "we also assume that there is on average one domain wall of comoving area @xmath23 per cube of comoving volume @xmath24 occupying one of the faces of the cube .",
    "hence , the probability that a face of such a cube is occupied by a domain wall is @xmath25 so that the variance in the number of domain walls per cube is @xmath26 where @xmath27 . hence @xmath28 . if we now consider a cube of comoving volume @xmath29 it will contain @xmath30 cubes of comoving volume @xmath24 .",
    "the standard deviation , @xmath31 , of @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 denotes the number of domain walls of comoving area @xmath23 and @xmath34 its average value ) on a given volume , @xmath35 , is proportional to @xmath36 and consequently @xmath37 this can also be calculated for any other variable , @xmath38 , characterising the network if @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath39 . in this case",
    "@xmath40 here the random variable @xmath38 may represent the total area @xmath13 , or the ratio between the kinetic and potential energy parametrised by @xmath41 .",
    "although in the first case it is a fair assumption to draw a direct relation between the number of domain walls and the total area , in the second case we expect the relation to be less direct due to the dispersion in the domain wall velocities and to the existence of an important fraction of the kinetic energy which is not associated with the domain walls themselves but with their decay products .    the scaling exponent may be calculated from the value of @xmath42 at two different values of the conformal time @xmath43 and @xmath44 as @xmath45 so that @xmath46 assuming that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are small ( compared with @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectivelly ) and uncorrelated . here",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the average value of @xmath53 over a given number , @xmath54 , of simulations .",
