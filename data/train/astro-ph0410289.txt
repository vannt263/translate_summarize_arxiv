    "some recent highly accurate numerical simulations of rotating compact objects such as a neutron star elucidate many features of compact objects such as an equilibrium configuration and its stability ( e.g. , shibata et al . 2002 , stergioulas et al . 2004 , zanotti and rezzolla 2002 , zdunik et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the deformation of their configurations causes a non - spherical distortion of the surrounding spacetime , which has not been observed yet . probing this warp of the spacetime",
    "provides a strong verification of the theory of the general relativity ( will 1993 ) and a deep insight into the relevant physics especially about the nuclear matter ( e.g. , shapiro and teukolsky 1983 ) , because the deformation depends not only on the gravity but also on the equation of state of the internal matter .",
    "one possibility is to study effects of the deformation on the light propagation near the compact object . before doing numerical studies in detail",
    ", it is important to find some physical properties by using a simple analytic model .",
    "one reason is that one needs many light ray tracings in numerical investigations , and consequently it is difficult to clarify quantitatively the parameter dependence .",
    "we perform the multipole expansion of the external gravitational field , which can be assumed to be weak along the line of sight even if the internal gravity is strong .",
    "namely , one can consider only the linearized potential .",
    "this does not mean that our system is linear , because the lens equation is non - linearly coupled with respect to the image positions as shown in the next section .",
    "the quadrupole moment depends on the rotation speed and the equation of the state for the internal matter .",
    "many years ago some comprehensive studies had been done for equilibrium configurations of rotating stars in the newtonian gravity , some of which are summarized in a famous textbook ( chandrasekhar 1987 ) .",
    "numerical investigations on this issue in the general relativity are still going on as mentioned in the beginning of this section ( e.g. , shibata et al .",
    "2002 , stergioulas et al .",
    "2004 , zanotti and rezzolla 2002 , zdunik et al .",
    "2004 ) . in an extreme case called as rapid rotation ,",
    "the quadrupole deviation of order of @xmath0 may be possible even for a neutron star .",
    "these results show that the deformation is dominated by the quadrupole moment and higher moments such as the octapole moment are much smaller .",
    "in addition , a contribution of the octapole moment in the external field decays faster than that of the quadrupole moment , because the ratio between the octapole potential and the quadrupole potential is of the order of the ratio of the stellar radius to the distance between the star and the field point , which becomes the impact parameter in the gravitational lensing .",
    "this ratio is so small that one can ignore approximately the octapole and higher moment in the lensing study .",
    "furthermore , radio observations such as the vlbi will be improved .",
    "if the accuracy is improved sufficiently , the present result will have a direct relevance with such an observation .",
    "hence , we consider in this paper the truncated multipole expansion up to the quadrupole moment .",
    "this consideration in the gravitational lens is not new but rather classical though it was done in a different context .",
    "for instance , the light deflection caused by the quadrupole moment of the sun was discussed in the context of tests of the general relativity ( epstein and shapiro 1980 ) . except for a case of the source on the equatorial plane , we need solve the lens equation numerically .",
    "a spherically symmetric galaxy and a quadrupole tidal part were extensively studied by kovner ( 1987 ) , in which most models are an extended sphere and the quadrupole part , and another model is a star with quadrupole shear induced by a galaxy where the star is located .",
    "the last model seems similar to our system of a deformed star .",
    "however , it should be noted that this extra shear does not come from a potential of the star but from that of the galaxy . in other words",
    ", the dependence of the shear on the radial coordinate is different from that for the deformed star .",
    "it is believed that gravitational lensing study needs some numerical techniques except for a few special cases such as a point mass lens or an axisymmetric mass distribution along the line of sight , because the lens equation is nonlinearly coupled ( for instance , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) . in recent",
    ", however , some development has been achieved : it has been shown that for two cases of a binary lens ( asada 2002 ) and an ellipsoidal lens ( asada et al .",
    "2003 ) the lens equation is reduced to a single polynomial .",
    "an advantage of this approach is saving time and computer resources , and another one is to enable us to study analytically the lensing , for instance to find out an analytic expression for caustics ( asada et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) which are curves on the source plane , and the number of images changes if a source crosses the caustics .",
    "this expression for the caustics is nothing but a discriminant for the polynomial , which determines a change in the number of roots for the equation : as known in algebra , the discriminant vanishes in a case of multiple roots , which corresponds to merging images or giant arcs in the gravitational lens .",
    "classification of the critical curves and caustics is of great importance .",
    "for instance , it was done intensively for a binary gravitational lens ( e.g. , dominik 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown also that one can derive a single polynomial equation for any set of the lens equations in polynomials by using the euclidean algorithm ( asada et al .",
    "2004 ) . in practice , however , in a case of the lens equation which is higher than fifth degree , this algebraic procedure needs a computer with a fast cpu and a huge memory , and furthermore the resultant equation may become too complicated to handle any more in the cartesian coordinates .",
    "in order to avoid this problem , the polar coordinates are adopted in this paper so that a simple result can be obtained .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , we show that the lens equation is reduced to a single polynomial equation .",
    "next , the analytic expression for the caustics is computed as the discriminant for the polynomial .",
    "finally , a parametric representation for the critical curves and caustics are obtained to clarify a topological feature of the critical curves .",
    "the lens equation relates the image angular position vector @xmath1 to the source angular position vector @xmath2 as @xmath3 where we used the thin - lens approximation , @xmath4 is the angular distance from the observer to the source , and @xmath5 is that from the lens to the source . the vector @xmath6 , which denotes the impact parameter to the light ray , is related to the image position as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the angular distance from the observer to the lens .    up to quadrupole moments in multipole expansions , the deflection angle @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes the mass of the lens , and the quadrupole moment tracefree on the lens plane is defined as @xmath12 so that the lens equation is simply rewritten as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 here , the renormalised quadrupole moment is defined as @xmath17 eq .",
    "( @xmath18 ) is a set of coupled equations which are seventh - order in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that we can hardly treat it analytically .    before examining eq .",
    "( @xmath18 ) in detail , we estimate the order of magnitude of the renormalised quadrupole moment .",
    "we can put @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes a distortion parameter and @xmath23 is a typical size of the lens object",
    ". truncations up to quadrupole moment in multipole expansions are valid if the asymmetry of the system is sufficiently small , say @xmath24 , though we do nt perform any expansion in @xmath22 .",
    "the renormalised quadrupole moment is rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the einstein ring radius . in most cases , @xmath23 is shorter than @xmath27",
    ". thus , @xmath28 must be less than @xmath29 , which is usually @xmath30 at most .",
    "for instance , we assume a nearby solar - type star at @xmath31pc , namely @xmath32 km , @xmath33 km . if it rotates much faster than the sun , say with the rotational surface velocity on the equatorial plane @xmath34km / s , the oblateness due to the centrifugal flattering is of the order of @xmath35 then , @xmath36 becomes about @xmath37 .",
    "if a light ray passes near the surface of the star , the leading term of the deflection angle is about @xmath38 arcsec . and",
    "the correction due to the quadrupole moment can be as large as @xmath31 microarcsec .",
    ", which will be detectable in principle by a near future astrometry mission such as gaia and sim , though such a probability may be extremely small .",
    "henceforth , we adopt a frame in which the reduced quadrupole moment is diagonalised as @xmath39 without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath40 . by denoting @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 , it is convenient to rewrite eqs .",
    "( @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath44 ) into a matrix form @xmath45 where @xmath46 here , @xmath47 and @xmath48 depend on the mass and quadrupole moment , respectively , where we should remember that our renormalisation was done in units of the einstein ring radius so that the mass does not appear explicitly .",
    "first of all , we consider a source located at the origin @xmath49 , namely exactly behind the lens object . for @xmath50 , the second line of eq .",
    "( @xmath51 ) means ( 1 ) @xmath52 or ( 2 ) @xmath53 . the case ( 1 )",
    "means @xmath54 , consequently @xmath55 .",

    "( @xmath51 ) becomes @xmath56 where we used @xmath57 .",

    "this is solved as @xmath69 which are real if and only if @xmath70 .",

    "( @xmath73 ) on @xmath74-axis if @xmath70 , or otherwise only the first two images on @xmath72-axis .",

    "we assume @xmath50 and @xmath75 .",
