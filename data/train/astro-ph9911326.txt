    "the second coral sea cosmology conference , on _ redshift surveys and cosmology _ , takes place in the midst of a burgeoning of massive redshift surveys made possible by highly - parallel spectrographs and/or dedicated telescopes .",
    "these redshift surveys stand on the shoulders of even more massive ( in terabyte terms ) imaging surveys at a variety of wavelengths , which provide complete , homogeneous and complementary ways of viewing the universe and selecting samples for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the wealth of detail produced by these surveys is provoking more sophisticated approaches to data reduction , analysis and archiving , which offer to both improve the primary science coming out of the surveys and provide a rich resource for astronomers to mine in the coming decade .",
    "the outline of this conference summary is as follows : sections  2 and  3 report on the status of redshift surveys , both in progress and planned , which are mapping the local and high - redshift universe ; section  4 summarises some of the preliminary results on large - scale structure derived from these and other recent surveys ; section  5 reports new results on the local galaxy population and its evolution out to high redshift ; section  6 looks to the future of redshift surveys as tools for cosmology .",
    "all references in [ .. ] are to papers in the www proceedings of the conference , available at .",
    "the two - degree field facility ( ) at the anglo - australian telescope is a 400-fibre optical spectrograph with a 2-diameter field of view . described how 2df s fast robotic fibre - positioner and two focal planes makes it ideally suited for massive redshift surveys . the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( )",
    "has now measured redshifts for more than 50,000 galaxies , making it the single largest redshift survey to date",
    ". gave an overview of the survey s status , reporting that , as of august 1999 , 227 of the 1093 survey fields have been observed , yielding redshifts for 53,192 objects , of which 50,180 are galaxies ( the remainder are mostly stars plus a handful of qsos ) .",
    "the redshift completeness of the survey is currently 91% and rising , as data quality and reduction methods are refined .",
    "the 2dfgrs will eventually provide redshifts and spectral information for 250,000 galaxies with @xmath1@xmath219.45 ( extinction - corrected ) over nearly 2000  sq.deg ( , ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : onsky ] shows the sky coverage of the 2dfgrs and a number of the other surveys mentioned here .",
    "although the survey is at present only 20% complete , it is expected to be finished by the end of 2001 .",
    "+   +    the 2dfgrs has a companion survey in the described by , which aims to obtain redshifts for more than 25,000 qsos with 18.25@xmath2@xmath1@xmath220.85 in two strips covering 740  sq.deg ( see figure  [ fig : onsky ] ) .",
    "the primary goals of the survey ( ) are to measure the primordial fluctuation power spectrum on very large scales , to obtain a geometric determination of the cosmological constant @xmath3 , and to investigate the evolution of the qso luminosity function and qso clustering .",
    "follow - ups will include studies of absorption - line and damped lyman-@xmath4 systems along qso sight - lines .",
    "the multicolour selection criteria for the target sample are expected to give a 93% completeness for the redshift range 0.3@xmath2@xmath5@xmath22.2 .",
    "as of august 1999 , 13,854 of the 48,078 qso candidates have been observed , and have yielded 7026 identified qsos .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dfzcone ] shows both the 2df galaxy and qso surveys on a single redshift cone diagram ; the density of sampling of the galaxies at low redshift is complemented by the sparser qso sample reaching out to beyond @xmath5=2.2 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( ) will be one of the largest and most comprehensive astronomical datasets ever produced .",
    "overviews of sdss science and operations were given by and ( see also ) .",
    "sdss is both a photometric and a spectroscopic survey of @xmath6 steradians of the northern sky with @xmath7 .",
    "the survey uses a purpose - built 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico , supported by a 0.5 m telescope providing continuous monitoring of the photometric conditions .",
    "the imaging system consists of a high - efficiency drift - scan camera using 30 ccds to image in five passbands quasi - simultaneously while covering the sky in 3-wide strips with an effective exposure time of 55s .",
    "this will yield images for 10@xmath8 galaxies and 5@xmath910@xmath10 stars down to @xmath11=23.1 over a quarter of the sky .",
    "the unique sdss photometric system ( @xmath12@xmath13@xmath11@xmath14@xmath15 ) was detailed by .",
    "the filter set is specially designed , featuring high - throughput , nearly - disjoint passbands covering the range from 0.31.0@xmath16 m .",
    "the imaging survey , which achieved first light in may 1998 , has already produced exciting discoveries , including the first @xmath5=5 qso ( ) and the coolest methane brown dwarf ( ) .",
    "listed the scientific strengths of sdss , in ascending order of importance , as : ( i )  the large database ; ( ii )  the homogeneity of the data ; ( iii )  the well - characterized sample ; ( iv )  discovery potential ; ( v )  the archival value of the imaging archive .",
    "the volume of data to be generated by sdss is enormous : 40  terabytes of raw data , reduced to a ` mere ' 1  terabyte when processed .",
    "described the complex data processing pipelines and archival database which will generate and make available the sdss data products , ranging from a heavily compressed all - sky map , through thumbnail images and spectra for every object , to the final photometric and redshift catalogues .",
    "szalay also outlined the sophisticated indexing procedures which will be used to facilitate a rapid response to complex search queries .",
    "described the sdss spectroscopic survey that will be carried out in parallel with the imaging survey ( ) . there are various spectroscopic target samples : the main galaxy sample , of 900,000 galaxies with petrosian magnitudes brighter than @xmath11@xmath1718.1 ; the bright red galaxy sample , of 100,000 galaxies brighter than @xmath11@xmath1719.3 , with selection by colour and photometric redshift to give early - type galaxies with 0.25@xmath2@xmath5@xmath20.45 ; the qso sample , of 100,000 qso candidates down to @xmath11@xmath1720 selected by colour or as first or rosat sources ; and the stellar sample , 100,000 stars of various types .",
    "in addition there will be a smaller number of serendipity sources , selected as ` interesting ' by a variety of criteria .",
    "it is important to note that the redshift sample generated by this spectroscopic survey will be supplemented by photometric redshifts with a precision of @xmath18@xmath170.05 for perhaps 10@xmath8 fainter galaxies , which , in conjunction with ` spectral ' types based on precision colours , will be invaluable for studying the evolution of the galaxy population out to @xmath5@xmath191 .",
    "a small amount of test data has been taken with the sdss spectrograph , a 640-fibre manually - configured system with a 3field of view .",
    "survey observations are expected to begin in early 2000 , with the whole sdss , both photometric and spectroscopic surveys , taking 5  years to complete .",
    "another view of the nearby universe is provided by the two - micron all - sky survey ( ) , whose current status was reviewed by .",
    "2mass is surveying the whole sky in the near - infrared @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands , and for galaxies expects to achieve limiting magnitudes in these bands of 15.0 , 14.3 and 13.5 respectively ( ) .",
    "the northern 2mass survey began in 1997 , and the southern survey in 1998 . at present 70% of the sky",
    "has been covered by 2mass , and the whole survey is expected to be completed by early 2001 .    the 2mass imaging survey will be followed up by two ( coordinated ) redshift surveys and two ( complementary ) peculiar velocity surveys . described the , which has the goal of measuring redshifts for 125,000 galaxies covering 90% of the sky down to @xmath22=12.2 .",
    "this would build on existing redshift catalogues and , in the north , fill in the missing redshifts with the 1.3 m at flwo used for the cfa redshift surveys . reported plans for a southern counterpart to this survey , using the 6df fibre spectrograph currently under construction for the aao schmidt telescope .",
    "the ( ) has two phases , the first of which is a redshift survey of 115,000 galaxies down to @xmath22=13 , @xmath21=13.5 or @xmath20=14.3 over the 17,000  sq.deg of the southern sky with @xmath23 . as well as completing the all - sky 2mass survey to @xmath22=12.2 and pushing another 0.8  mag fainter , this first phase of the 6df survey will provide a volume - limited sample for the second phase , a peculiar velocity survey of at least 15,000 early - type galaxies at distances less than @xmath24=15000  using the fundamental plane distance estimator .",
    "this in turn will complement an all - sky peculiar velocity survey of 10,000 spirals using the infrared tully - fisher relation proposed by .    reviewed the progress and some preliminary results from the hi",
    "parkes all - sky survey (; ) , which is currently using the parkes 21 cm multi - beam receiver to cover the sky south of @xmath25=+25  out to a maximum redshift of @xmath24=12700 . as of august 1999 , the southern hemisphere survey is over 90% complete , and the northern extension is over 10% complete .",
    "hipass provides a complete 21 cm survey of the southern sky with 7  arcmin angular resolution down to a 3@xmath26 hi mass limit of 1.4@xmath9@xmath27 ( ) . when complete , hipass is expected to contain @xmath195000 galaxies with a mean redshift of 3000 .",
    "the effective volume of the sample is 6@xmath910@xmath28 .",
    "hipass should offer a very different view of the local universe to optical and near - infrared redshift surveys , and it will be interesting to see the differences in the galaxy population and the large - scale structure , especially for low - mass objects .",
    "figure  [ fig : sizevol ] compares the number of objects and the volume encompassed by various redshift surveys .",
    "the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( ) is a two - phase survey of galaxies at redshifts out to @xmath5@xmath191 using the keck telescopes and hst .",
    "reported results from the first phase of deep , now approaching completion , and outlined plans for the more ambitious second phase , which will use the spectrograph on keck . the first phase ( ) utilised lris on keck , in conjunction with hst imaging , to carry out a redshift survey of @xmath191000 galaxies down to @xmath29=24 .",
    "this survey was followed up with more detailed studies of galaxy kinematics and other physical properties for small subsamples .",
    "the second phase , using the multi - slit spectrograph deimos , aims to perform a redshift survey of 50,000 galaxies to @xmath29=23 plus another 5000 galaxies going one magnitude deeper ( ) .",
    "the sample will be defined using photometric redshifts to select the objects with 0.7@xmath2@xmath5@xmath21.2 .",
    "the main goals of the survey will be to study the evolution of both the galaxy population and the large - scale structure , and it is expected to run from early 2000 to late 2003 .    more ambitious still is the survey described by .",
    "this will use the optical ( vimos ) and near - infrared ( nirmos ) multi - slit spectrographs currently being built for eso s vlt . using 120 nights of guaranteed time on the vlt , the survey will measure redshifts for 100,000 galaxies down to @xmath30=22 over 20  sq.deg , and for 50,000 galaxies down to @xmath30=24 over 2  sq.deg ( ) . a further @xmath191000 redshifts will be obtained down to @xmath30@xmath1926 over a 1  sq.arcmin field using the spectrograph s 6400-fibre integral field unit .",
    "vimos will see first light in mid-2000 and nirmos in mid-2001 ; the survey is expected to take 34  years .",
    "results on large - scale structure ( lss ) were reported by a number of speakers at the conference . described a determination of the power spectrum of galaxy fluctuations from the iras - based point source catalogue redshift survey ( ) . using a sample of 14,500 galaxies with 60@xmath16 m flux of more than 0.6  jy covering 84% of the sky , the pscz team find that they are able to determine the power spectrum , @xmath31 , for wavenumbers down to 0.03(i.e",
    ".  scales up to 200 ) .",
    "the results ( , ) are consistent with the earlier qdot and 1.2  jy surveys , although @xmath31 is significantly better determined . for plausible values of the small - scale velocity dispersion , @xmath31 is well - fit by a cdm - like model with shape parameter @xmath32@xmath170.25 and normalisation @xmath33@xmath170.75 ( although assuming a larger dispersion permits a model with @xmath32@xmath170.5 to be marginally acceptable )",
    ".    reported an estimate of @xmath34 derived from the comparison of the local group ( lg ) motion with respect to the cmb and the motion predicted from a model based on clusters and voids identified in the pscz and the literature ( see also , ) .",
    "the predicted lg dipole has nearly converged by @xmath5=0.1 ( with most of the lg motion generated within 200 ) ; linear theory requires @xmath35@xmath170.7 to fit the observed amplitude of the lg motion .    summarised the results of the eso slice project (; ) redshift survey .",
    "this pre - cursor to surveys like the 2dfgrs used photographic sky survey plates to select a sample of galaxies down to @xmath1=19.4 in a single 1@xmath935  strip .",
    "redshifts were obtained for 3342 galaxies ( 85% complete ; vettolani et al .",
    "perhaps the most significant lss result to emerge from esp , is that there is good evidence for a local under - density of nearly a factor of 2 extending out to 250  ( ) . this is consistent with the normalisation difference between the luminosity functions derived from surveys at this depth ( esp itself and the autofib survey , ) and those derived from shallower surveys such as apm - stromlo ( ) .",
    "it also ` explains ' the origin of the steep number counts at bright magnitudes ( ) , although it begs the question of the completeness of the galaxy catalogues derived from photographic surveys at bright magnitudes .",
    "the local void implied by this result would appear to cover much of the south galactic cap , as evidenced by the north / south difference in galaxy density found in the pscz , lcrs and cfa2 surveys .",
    "is this void , with an amplitude @xmath36@xmath19@xmath170.5 compatible with statistical measures of clustering ?",
    "the esp redshift - space correlation function is in good agreement with other determinations on scales between 1 and 50 , though a little lower on the smaller scales .",
    "the power spectrum is likewise consistent with other determinations at wavenumbers @xmath37@xmath380.1 .",
    "however the small volume covered by the survey , and its strip geometry , prevent a reliable determination of @xmath31 at wavenumbers below about 0.1  ( i.e.scales above 60 ) .",
    "an efficient approach to surveying larger volumes , and so measuring @xmath31 at smaller @xmath37 , is to use redshift surveys of clusters , since clusters are about 5@xmath9 more strongly clustered than galaxies .",
    "results from two such surveys were summarised at the meeting . and reported early results from the reflex survey , while summarised the results from the first stage of the apm cluster survey .    noted the advantages of an x - ray selected cluster sample as being the close correlation between @xmath39 and mass , and the minimisation of projection effects .",
    "he described the detection of clusters in the rosat all sky survey for the reflex ( southern ) and noras ( northern ) samples ( ) .",
    "together these samples comprise over 900 clusters covering the whole sky at latitudes @xmath40 down to a flux limit of @xmath41=3@xmath910@xmath42  ergs@xmath43 .",
    "the preliminary power spectrum derived from the reflex survey using a subset of 188 clusters in a 400  co - moving cube ( ) appears to show a significant turnover in @xmath31 at @xmath37@xmath170.040.05 , corresponding to 125160 .",
    "presented very preliminary results from a larger sample of clusters in a 1000  comoving cube which confirm the turnover in @xmath31 .",
    "but the newer results also hint at a possible second peak in @xmath31 at @xmath37@xmath190.01 , although a @xmath44=0.7 flat cdm model remains consistent within the ( large ) uncertainties .",
    "described a similar survey , the apm cluster redshift survey ( ) .",
    "the first phase of this survey consisted of 364 clusters drawn from the apm cluster catalogue of 960 clusters covering 4500  sq.deg .",
    "the apm clusters provide a cleanly - selected sample that is largely unaffected by the inhomogeneities and projection effects afflicting the abell catalogue .",
    "the redshift - space cluster - cluster correlation function @xmath45 is well represented by a power law with index @xmath46@xmath192 and a correlation length of 14  ( smaller than that of the abell catalogue ) .",
    "the lss as measured from clusters provides a clean comparison with cosmological models , since clusters are readily identified from the dark matter halos without the confusion of a bias parameter .",
    "the apm @xmath45 is consistent with @xmath3cdm and mdm models , but has more clustering than is predicted by standard cdm .",
    "an estimate of @xmath34 can be obtained by comparing the real - space and redshift - space cluster - galaxy cross - correlation functions @xmath47 .",
    "the real - space @xmath48 was derived from the cluster survey and the apm galaxy catalogue by inverting the angular cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function .",
    "the redshift - space @xmath49 , as a function of separation in the plane of the sky ( @xmath26 ) and along the line of sight ( @xmath6 ) , was derived from the cluster survery and the stromlo - apm redshift survey .",
    "these two @xmath47 s can be related using a model incorporating non - linear infall and the velocity dispersion of galaxies around clusters .",
    "showed that the best - fit model yields an estimate of @xmath35@xmath170.4 , with a 95% upper confidence limit of @xmath35@xmath20.7 .",
    "the power spectrum from the apm cluster survey shows a turnover at @xmath37@xmath170.03 , but the median depth of the survey ( 270 ) is only just adequate to measure @xmath31 on this 200scale . to improve the significance of this detection and reduce the systematic errors ,",
    "the second phase of the apm cluster survey , now underway , will obtain redshifts for the remaining clusters in the apm cluster catalogue , bringing the sample up to 960 clusters .",
    "this cluster survey , which will take 23 years to complete , will be particularly useful since it overlaps with the 2df galaxy redshift survey .    the _",
    "faint _ galaxy correlation function at large angular scales was discussed by , who has used digitally - stacked schmidt plates to achieve an approximate limit of @xmath50=23.5 .",
    "this gives 700,000 galaxies in each of two 40  sq.deg fields .",
    "the median redshift at this depth is @xmath5@xmath170.4 .",
    "the correlation function he derives is well - fit as a power - law , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , over the range 0.0510 .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function declines as @xmath53 with @xmath54@xmath170 , corresponding to fixed clustering in physical coordinates .",
    "however these results hide the different clustering properties of the red and blue galaxies , which are respectively fitted by models with @xmath46=1.8 , @xmath54=@xmath551.3 and scalelength @xmath56=8.6 , and @xmath46=1.6 , @xmath54=@xmath551.5 and @xmath56=3.5 .",
    "the clustering amplitude of red galaxies is thus about 5@xmath9 higher than the blue galaxies .",
    "the lack of any significant strengthening of the clustering amplitude of blue galaxies out to @xmath5@xmath190.4 suggests that the increase in the population of blue galaxies in clusters with redshift ( the butcher - oemler effect ) is simply related to the overall increase in the faint blue galaxy population with redshift .",
    "the lss goals of the , and some preliminary results from the survey , were described by .",
    "the main lss goals are : ( i )  the determination of @xmath31 on large scales ( @xmath38100 ) ; ( ii )  the topology of the 3d distribution ; ( iii )  tests of gaussianity ( on large scales ) and biasing ( on small scales ) from higher - order statistics ; ( iv )  estimation of the mass density @xmath57 and the bias parameter(s ) @xmath58 from the redshift - space distortions .",
    "dalton discussed the tiling and fibre - assignment algorithms used in the survey , and showed that the restrictions on minimum fibre separations mean the survey is significantly biased against close pairs with separations less than 2  arcmin ( corresponding to 150  at the median depth of the survey , @xmath5=0.1 ) .",
    "this effect , and the variation in redshift completeness with apparent magnitude , are taken into account when estimating or simulating the large - scale structure statistics derived from the survey",
    ".    showed preliminary determinations of the redshift - space correlation function @xmath59 for the 2dfgrs .",
    "there is very good agreement with the results obtained from the las campanas redshift survey ( ) .",
    "the distortions in @xmath59 shown in figure  [ fig : xisigpi ] are roughly consistent with a model with @xmath60 and small - scale velocity dispersion @xmath61 . a similar value for @xmath35 emerges from the quadrupole to monopole ratio of the redshift - space distortions on large scales . as a consistency check on the results ,",
    "the projected correlation function @xmath62 , derived by integrating over @xmath59 , has been compared to that obtained by from a deprojection of the angular correlation function of the parent apm galaxy catalogue .",
    "there is excellent agreement on scales up to 30 , while on larger scales the cosmic variance dominates the uncertainties in the as - yet - incomplete 2dfgrs .    in a similar vein ,",
    "showed the results of simulations indicating the precision that the sloan survey will achieve in recovering cosmological parameters from lss statistics .",
    "sdss should be able to measure the power spectrum normalization @xmath33 to a precision of 5% , the power spectrum shape parameter @xmath32 to 20% , and the redshift - distortion parameter @xmath35 ( which involves both the mass density @xmath57 and the bias parameter @xmath58 , @xmath34 ) to 35% . the precision with which @xmath31 will be determined is illustrated in figure  [ fig : wkpk ] , which shows both the effective window functions of various surveys and the simulated recovery of @xmath31 from the sloan survey , with estimated errors .    on larger scales of both space and time , reported preliminary lss results for the .",
    "the lss goals of the qso survey are : ( i )  determining the qso @xmath31 out to scales @xmath191000 ; ( ii )  measuring the cosmological constant @xmath3 from geometrical ( as opposed to dynamical ) distortions of clustering in redshift space ; ( iii )  tracing the evolution of qso clustering out to @xmath5@xmath193 to constrain @xmath57 and the qso bias parameter . as with the galaxy survey ,",

    "preliminary determinations of the 0.3@xmath2@xmath5@xmath22.2 qso correlation function using 2765 qsos give @xmath46@xmath171.4 and scaling lengths @xmath56@xmath173  and for @xmath56@xmath175  for models with ( @xmath63=1,@xmath44=0 ) and ( @xmath63=0.3,@xmath44=0.7 ) respectively , with the clustering appearing to be constant in comoving coordinates over this range . with the full qso survey it should be possible to measure @xmath46 to 3% and @xmath56 to 5% on small scales , and on large scales to measure @xmath31 on scales @xmath37@xmath380.01  ( i.e.  @xmath2600 ) .",
    "other cosmological parameters were addressed by mould and peterson . summarised the results from the hst key project to measure the hubble constant , @xmath64 ( ) .",
    "this work essentially consists of using cepheid distances to calibrate a wide variety of distance estimators , including type ia supernovae , the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies , and the fundamental plane and surface brightness fluctuations for bulge - dominated galaxies .",

    "addressed the question of whether a cosmological constant is demanded by the galaxy number counts .",
    "he finds that the surface density of faint galaxies derived from the optical and near - infrared number counts is too high to be compatible with a @xmath63=1 cosmology , and are much better fitted by a low - density flat universe with @xmath44@xmath170.8 .",
    "although this claim depends on the assumed evolutionary history of the galaxies , peterson argued that models which reproduce the number counts by invoking merger - driven evolution are inconsistent with the low measured amplitude of the angular correlation function for faint galaxies .",
    "the new generation of large redshift surveys promise to reveal the properties of the galaxy population in extraordinary detail .",
    "some of this potential was revealed by various preliminary results emerging from the 2dfgrs . summarised some of the recent work by members of the survey team on the local luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "the overall lf shows clear signs of being more complex than the standard schechter form , with a steepening of the faint end for @xmath73 . using a principal component analysis ( pca ) to classify the galaxies into 5 spectral types ( ) ,",
    "it is clear that this is the result of a general steepening of the faint end for later - type galaxies , which dominate the population at lower luminosities .",
    "however this type of analysis does not help explain the large variation between different determinations of the local lf , not only in the faint end but also in the normalization .",
    "a more general approach is required , which will account for surface brightness selection effects .",
    "reported a preliminary determination ( cross et  al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "of the bivariate brightness distribution ( bbd ) , the joint distribution over absolute magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "this shows that the 2dfgrs is _ not _ severely affected by its selection limit at low surface brightness , as the galaxy number distribution falls off sharply before that limit is reached .",
    "the bbd is strongly suggestive of the existence of separate dwarf and giant populations , the former with a lf that is flat or declining at the faint end and the latter with a steeply increasing faint end .",
    "more detailed analyses of the galaxy population can be carried out using various quantities derived from the spectra : showed that measurement of the h@xmath4 equivalent width can be used to map the relative distributions of the star - forming and quiescent galaxies in the 2dfgrs ( lewis et  al .",

    "about 5% of nvss sources are found in the 2dfgrs , and about 1.5% of 2dfgrs sources are in nvss ; in the full redshift survey there should be about 4000 radio galaxies .",
    "the 700 sources identified so far , with roughly equal numbers of star - forming galaxies , optical agn and radio agn , already make up the largest homogeneous sample of optical spectra for radio galaxies .",
    "the first result emerging from this sample is a much - improved determination of the radio luminosity function , which has a double - humped appearance . by using the pca spectral types ,",
    "showed that this structure is due to different luminosity functions for the agn ( which dominate at high luminosity ) and the star - forming galaxies ( which have a steeper slope and dominate at lower luminosities ) .",
    "described the potentialities for future work combining radio surveys such as nvss , sumss and with large redshift surveys such as the 2df galaxy and qso surveys , sdss and the 6df survey .",
    "understanding the properties of radio galaxy populations is very much hindered by the lack of large , homogeneous redshift samples .",
    "cross - identification with the 2dfgrs allows the definition and detailed studies of the local radio galaxy populations : the luminosity functions ( see above ) , environmental effects , clustering and low - redshift evolution .",
    "cross - identification with the 2df qso survey allows similar studies of radio - loud qsos .",
    "limitations arise from the joint radio / optical selection criteria , nonetheless such studies promise to greatly improve our understanding of radio galaxies",
    ".    showed the results obtained on qso evolution using a homogeneous sample of 3265 qsos from the 2df qso redshift survey .",
    "he finds that the luminosity function is fitted by a double power law ( i.e.  it has a break ) , and that the change in the lf with redshift is consistent with a @xmath63@xmath170.3 , @xmath44@xmath170.7 universe and pure luminosity evolution with the approximate form @xmath74 out to @xmath5=2.3 .",
    "he noted that the sdss qso survey , which is not limited by uvx selection , may be able to see whether this evolution turns around for redshifts between 2.3 and 3 , with decreasing numbers of qsos at fixed luminosity .",
    "he also reported results from hst and ground - based imaging of a sample of 76 low - redshift , x - ray selected agn ( schade et  al .",
    "1999 , in prep . ) . host galaxies with @xmath75@xmath2@xmath76@xmath2@xmath77",
    "were detected in all cases , with 55% of agn residing in bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "a weak correlation is found between the agn and host luminosities .",
    "interestingly , 10% of agn hosts do not show a point source ( in agreement with hst studies of fainter agn ) .",
    "the luminosities , sizes and morphologies of the agn hosts are completely consistent with the ` normal ' galaxy population , except that agn preferentially reside in bulge - dominated systems .",
    "presented some recent results from surveys of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at z@xmath193 and z@xmath194 ( , ) .",
    "the colour - selection of lbgs is a highly efficient method for generating samples of star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations have now provided redshifts for more than 750 galaxies with @xmath5=25 .",
    "the selection biases are believed to be well - understood , so that it is possible to compute the far - ultraviolet luminosity function ( lf ) for the lbgs .",
    "combining ground - based and hubble deep field samples , the @xmath5@xmath193 lf ( measured in the @xmath78 band , which corresponds to @xmath191700  in the rest - frame ) is found to be well - represented by a schechter function with a steep faint end ( @xmath4@xmath17@xmath551.6 ) , although the slope does depend on the incompleteness correction that is applied . with assumptions about the lbg spectral energy distribution , and using the reddening law ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the extinction by dust in the lbgs .",
    "the median extinction at rest - frame 1500  is found to be 1.7  mag , and integrated over the whole population the uv extinction is about a factor of 7 .",
    "the smaller spectroscopic sample of lbgs selected at @xmath5@xmath194 does not show any significant change from the @xmath5@xmath193 population : the lfs of both samples are consistent in shape and normalisation .",
    "the lbgs are very strongly clustered , with co - moving correlation function amplitude at least as great as that of @xmath5@xmath190 galaxies .",
    "given the weaker mass clustering at early epochs , this implies much stronger biasing .",
    "however this picture is consistent with the predictions of simple analytic models ( e.g.  ) for the evolution of galaxy clustering based on the measured power spectrum for low - redshift galaxies .",
    "francis and illingworth reported studies of high - redshift galaxy clusters .",
    "showed hst results relating to the nature of galaxies in rich environments at @xmath5@xmath190.31 .",
    "the mild evolution in the fundamental plane for the e and s0 galaxies in the cluster cl1358 + 62 , relative to the nearby coma cluster , implies that these galaxies are a mature , homogeneous population whose stars formed at redshifts @xmath5@xmath381 ( ) . the absorption linestrengths are also consistent with old , single - burst populations in which metallicity increases with velocity dispersion . for early - type spirals ,",
    "however , there is a positive correlation between luminosity - weighted age and velocity dispersion .",
    "in contrast to this evidence for a high redshift of star formation in early - type galaxies , also reported results from a morphological study of the cluster ms1054@xmath5503 at @xmath5=0.83 which show a high merger rate in this luminous x - ray cluster .",
    "if this rate is typical for clusters at this redshift , it implies that up to 50% of the massive ellipticals in clusters may be formed in mergers at redshifts @xmath5@xmath21 ( ) . hence , the stars in cluster ellipticals form early , but the galaxies final morphological forms may be more lately acquired .",
    "described a detailed investigation of a candidate galaxy cluster at @xmath5=2.38 .",
    "narrow - band imaging of this cluster shows three bright lyman-@xmath4 sources , one of which is more than 50 in extent .",
    "two of these sources have very red colours , and near - infrared photometry shows that their spectral energy distributions are poorly - fit by dust - obscured star - forming regions , but well - fit by a stellar populations with ages @xmath190.5gyr and masses of a few times 10@xmath79 .",
    "a number of other objects with similar infrared colours are seen in the cluster , and have luminosity profiles more consistent with an @xmath80 law than an exponential disk .",
    "the cluster lies in front of three qsos , and in all three sight - lines there are neutral hydrogen absorption lines ( including damped lyman-@xmath4 systems ) at the cluster redshift .",
    "this suggests the cluster contains a large amount of neutral hydrogen , perhaps more than 10@xmath81 , which may be in the form of large numbers of short - lived 10@xmath28  clouds .",
    "reviewed the constraints on the history of star formation and the mass density in stars that can be derived from the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "he notes that the logarithmic slope of the faint galaxy counts drops below 0.4 at wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the near - infrared at the limits achieved in the hubble deep fields ( figure  [ fig : counts]a ; ) .",
    "this implies the ebl is converging , with the bulk of the light already observed ( figure  [ fig : counts]b ) , and gives a lower limit to the ebl intensity over the range 0.22.2@xmath16 m of 15  nwm@xmath82sr@xmath66 .",
    "combined with measurements of the far - infrared background light from cobe , and making approximate corrections for unresolved sources and the wings of the galaxy light profiles , madau estimates that the total ebl intensity is 55@xmath6720  nwm@xmath82sr@xmath66 . using stellar population models and assumptions about the stellar initial mass function",
    ", he finds that the ebl requires that the present - day mass density in processed gas and stars has a lower limit of @xmath83@xmath380.0013 , corresponding to @xmath84@xmath383.5 .",
    "plausible models for the star - formation history give @xmath85 twice as large . another constraint arising from the ebl",
    "relates to the possibility raised by the macho gravitational lensing survey that galaxies dark halos may be composed of faint white dwarfs .",
    "madau finds that in fact no more than 5% of the baryons can be in form of stellar remnants without over - producing the ebl .",
    "cowie and rowan - robinson discussed what can be learnt about galaxy evolution by combining submillimetre observations with optical and infrared data . presented models of the star - formation history of the universe based on results from imaging surveys of galaxies at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths . the european large - area iso survey (; )",
    "has employed the satellite to image 412  sq.deg at 6.7@xmath16 m , 15@xmath16 m , 90@xmath16 m and 175@xmath16 m , reaching down to 3  mjy at 15@xmath16 m .",
    "this survey is supported by optical and near - infrared imaging , 21 cm observations , and a submillimetre survey of 0.02  sq.deg down to 8  mjy at 850@xmath16 m .",
    "rowan - robinson uses simple parametrised star - formation models to fit the infrared and submillimetre galaxy counts ( ) .",
    "he finds that the star - formation rate increases to @xmath5@xmath191 and then remains high out to at least @xmath5@xmath195 . within this framework",
    ", the submillimetre background intensity can be used to discriminate between cosmological models by comparing their predictions with the observed far - infrared and submillimetre background spectrum . a low - density",
    "( @xmath57@xmath170.3 , @xmath3=0 ) model is preferred ; a high - density ( @xmath57=1 , @xmath3=0 ) model requires a spike in the star - formation rate at @xmath5@xmath385 , while a flat ( @xmath57@xmath170.3 , @xmath3@xmath170.7 ) model requires truncation of star - formation at @xmath5@xmath865 .    noted that the submillimetre background flux indicates that much of the energy produced by star - formation and agn is re - processed by dust to far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "scuba observations at 850@xmath16 m show that the background is due to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies at redshifts @xmath5@xmath381 .",
    "submillimetre imaging has poor spatial resolution , but the fact that both submillimetre and centimeter flux are related to star - formation rate has meant that centimetre radio observations can be used to locate the submillimetre sources ( ) .",
    "however these objects turn out to be extremely faint in the optical and near - infrared , and inaccessible to spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "nonetheless it is possible to estimate their redshifts from the shape of their spectral energy distribution at submillimetre and radio wavelengths .",
    "this procedure suggests they are at redshifts @xmath5=13 ; if so , the submillimetre sources are a major star - forming population at high redshift ( )",
    ".    outlined models for the evolution of the star and gas content of galaxies , giving special consideration to the effects of dust ( ) .",
    "she estimates that the presence of dust suppresses the uv flux by a factor of 2.55 at @xmath5=13 , with a significant fraction of the radiation from star - formation emerging in the far - infrared .",
    "star formation histories with either low star - formation rates and low dust content at high redshift , or with high star - formation rates and high dust content , are both compatible with the observed ultraviolet flux , but can differ by an order of magnitude in the numbers of stars produced at @xmath5@xmath383 . both types of model predict that the far - infrared background is mostly produced by high - redshift sources , but the model with a constant star - formation rate for 1@xmath2@xmath5@xmath24 predicts the dust will be hotter at high redshift .",
    "the ` next generation ' was the theme of the final session of the conference .",
    "discussed new observational techniques for redshift surveys .",
    "he described the application of the ` nod and shuffle ' ( also known as ` va et vient ' ) and ` micro - slit ' techniques , which together allow near - optimal sky - subtraction at faint magnitudes and a greatly increased multiplex gain .",
    "high - precision sky - subtraction is achieved by simultaneously moving the electrons back and forth on the ccd ( charge - shuffling ) in concert with moving the telescope back and forth on the sky ( nodding ) .",
    "this exact differential beam - switching approach means that the object and the sky are observed through the same part of the slit ( or the same fibre ) and with the same pixels of the detector , but avoids the extra read - noise imposed by simply nodding between exposures .",
    "it also offers more rapid time - sampling . with near - perfect sky - subtraction ,",
    "long slits are not needed , so one can use small apertures ( micro - slits ) in the focal plane mask , and so observe many more objects simultaneously .",
    "glazebrook described how these techniqes ( and the introduction of a volume - phase holographic grating ) allowed the ldss++ spectrograph on the 4-metre aat to measure redshifts in the hubble deep field south to @xmath78@xmath1724 in a 12  hour exposure ( 6  hours on - object ) .",
    "further extensions to this technique include the use of blocking filters to isolate small spectral ranges and so allow more spectra to be crammed onto the detector .",
    "alternatively , one can use a ` pseudo - slitless ' mode in which the object spectra are allowed to overlap ( as in objective prism spectroscopy , but with a mask ) .",
    "the ambiguity of which line belongs to which object can be resolved by obtaining a second set of spectra with the grating rotated through 180 .",
    "glazebrook outlined some case studies showing how these techniques could significantly improve the grasp ( in terms of both depth and sample size ) of the next generation of redshift surveys .",
