    "the pseudospin symmetry ( pss ) , manifested by the quasidegeneracy between single - nucleon states with quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 , was found more than 40 years ago  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , substantial efforts had been devoted to understanding the dynamic origin of the pss until it was recognized that the pss is a symmetry hidden in the equations for the small component of dirac spinors .",
    "this might be natural and became clear later on since the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models are characteristic of the dynamical description of the spin degree of freedom and spin - orbit interactions  @xcite .",
    "the exact pss is a consequence of the fact that the scalar and vector potentials are equal in size but opposite in sign , i.e. , @xmath4 , while in practice the pss is approximate since the condition @xmath5 gives no bound state as in the rmf theory .",
    "however , the exception was found in ref .",
    "@xcite when the confining potential exists . in the schrdinger - like equation for the small component of the dirac spinor",
    ", the term proportional to @xmath6 is related to the breaking of the pss , and the small magnitude of that term gives the approximate pss . for further understanding the properties of the pss",
    ", people have studied the pss in a number of physical processes and phenomena including superdeformation  @xcite , nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleus scatterings  @xcite , single particle resonant states  @xcite , superheavy magic structures  @xcite , identical bands  @xcite , and pseudospin partner bands  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the pss breaking , proportional to the radial gradient of the potential @xmath7 , can vary with the isospin and charge of nuclei through the vector potential entry  @xcite . in the past ,",
    "the pss breaking had been studied extensively , and some very useful tools were also developed to analyze the breaking  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the isospin effects on the pss breaking , the variation of the isoscalar potentials can also become one pss breaking source , although this variation in different normal nuclei in the nuclear chart is not significant . in this work ,",
    "our attention to the pss breaking is focused on the exotic systems , the kaonic nuclei that may feature a characteristic enhancement of the isoscalar density in the core of nuclei .    by analyzing experimental data of kaonic atoms and @xmath0 scatterings ,",
    "people have found that @xmath0 interaction is strongly attractive at saturation density but with an optical potential depth roughly ranging from 40 to 200 mev  @xcite .",
    "the great interest in studying kaonic nuclei has been attracted by the fact that the same sign of the vector and scalar potentials of the @xmath8 creates a strong attraction that may lead to high - density @xmath1-nuclear bound states . in the past",
    ", lots of theoretical works have flourished .",
    "for instance , few - body calculations  @xcite , the rmf and non - relativistic skyrme - hartree - fock researches  @xcite , were performed to obtain the @xmath8 binding energy , the width and ground - state properties of @xmath1-nuclear bound states . along with various predictions ,",
    "experiments for the @xmath8 bound states have also been progressive with the construction of new facilities@xcite .",
    "though the pss is one of fundamental nuclear properties , it has not received due attention in kaonic nuclei .",
    "indeed , the pss has seldom been examined in kaonic nuclei .",
    "thus , it is the aim of this work to investigate how the pss is affected by the strong @xmath8-nucleon attraction in the rmf theory . for completeness and comparison",

    "the concept of pss is introduced to describe the quasidegeneracy in some nuclei between single - nucleon states with quantum numbers @xmath53 and @xmath3 , e.g. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the pss can be understood as a relativistic symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian originating from the near equality in magnitude of the scalar potential s(r ) and vector potential v(r ) but different in sign , i.e. @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "the quality of the approximate symmetry was found to be associated with the competition between pseudocentrifugal barrier and the pseudospin - orbit potential  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate in the rmf the conditions for the pss .",
    "since the meson fields are classical in the rmf , one can write the dirac hamiltonian for nucleons in spherical nuclei as @xmath57 it is well - known that the total angular momentum * j * commutates with the hamiltonian and is a conserved operator .",
    "while the orbital angular momentum @xmath58 does not commute with the _  _ , to characterize the full set of quantum numbers of single - particle states , one invokes another conserved operator * k * @xmath59 with its eigenvalues @xmath60 then we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for a spherical system , the quantum number set is @xmath63 where _ n _ is the principle quantum number , _ m _ is the magnetic quantum number , and @xmath64 denotes the isospin . with these quantum numbers ,",

    "if the sop term equals exactly to zero , say , @xmath84 or @xmath85 , it can be obviously seen from eq .",

    "one can easily find out that those states with @xmath87 and @xmath88 share the same eigenvalues .",

    "( [ eqf ] ) . introducing @xmath92",
    ", we can see that those states with @xmath93 and @xmath94 have the same eigenvalues .",
    "this type of degeneracy was named the pss in resemblance to the spin symmetry . however , the pss is nonexistent once the psop term is far away from zero . generally speaking , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quality of the pss is tightly associated with the relative magnitude of pcb to the psop in the rmf , while the correlation between psop term and the pss is not simply linear  @xcite .    in a normal nuclear system ,",
    "the attractive potential is usually around 380mev , while the repulsion is around 320mev .",
    "it gives rise to @xmath95mev , corresponding to relative large sop term , while the @xmath96 is around @xmath97 mev , leading to a relative small psop term .",
    "this estimation indicates that the pss is developed much better than the spin symmetry in normal nuclear single - particle spectra .",
    "in plenty of nuclei , the pss exists approximately and the splitting of pseudospin doublets @xmath53 and @xmath3 is relatively small , compared to the separation between two levels nearby .",
    "but the appearance of @xmath8 could change the proportion of the attraction to the repulsion , leading to the alteration of @xmath98 and @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the general situation for the pss in kaonic nuclei can be rather different and it is worthy of careful investigations .",
    "as one source term of the mean field , the @xmath8 diminishes its role in the mean field with the increase of the nuclear mass . thus , our investigation is limited to the medium and light nuclei in which the @xmath8 has more distinct effects on nuclear properties , especially the bulk density of the nuclear system and the single - particle energy for the pseudospin and spin doublets .",
    "we perform calculations with the nl3 parameter set  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath99 and @xmath100 are chosen from su(3 ) relations : @xmath101 , and the @xmath102 is adjusted to yield a @xmath8 binding energy @xmath103=100mev for @xmath104ca where the @xmath103 is defined as the difference of the total binding energy between the kaonic nucleus and its normal counterpart without @xmath8 . though the moderately deep optical potential is adopted here ( @xmath105 mev ) , as in some pioneer works  @xcite , we will examine the cases for various binding energies at last .",
    "the coupled equations ( [ eomr]),([kg - k ] ) , ( [ up ] ) and ( [ low ] ) are solved self - consistently by an iterative procedure .",

    "interestingly , with the increase of the nucleon number , the orbital shifts in heavier nuclei @xmath120ni , @xmath122se , and @xmath124zr even favor the approximate pss , being more satisfactory than those in corresponding normal nuclei .",
    "this takes place because the shallower binding of the @xmath54 state in the pseudospin doublet of heavier nuclei accompanies with the smaller binding enhancement of such a state in corresponding kaonic nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - orbit splittings between @xmath107 and @xmath108 all get a rise in kaonic nuclei listed in table  [ spectra ] .",

    "thus , it is valuable to investigate the dependence of energy splittings of the pseudospin and spin doublets on the @xmath8 binding energy .",
    "specifically , we obtain various splittings of pseudospin and spin doublets by changing @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which is equivalent to varying the @xmath8 binding energy .",
    "results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ ls - b ] for the pseudospin doublets ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , ( @xmath108 and @xmath107 ) and ( @xmath55 and @xmath106 ) . at the point @xmath103=0 , i.e. the normal @xmath113ca , the pseudospin doublet splitting between @xmath54 and @xmath55 is less than 1 mev .",
    "the splitting becomes increasingly large with the enhancement of the @xmath8-nuclear attraction , while a clear increase appears at @xmath145 .",
    "similarly , the splitting of the spin doublets @xmath108 and @xmath107 is apparently amplified by increasing the @xmath8-nuclear attraction .",
    "we see that the effect on the doublet @xmath55 and @xmath106 is relatively smaller .",
    "this is understandable since the out - layer states are less affected by the interior @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , larger @xmath8 binding can generally result in more prominent phenomenon of the pseudospin and spin symmetry breakings , especially for interior states .",
    "the above discussion on the association between the doublet splittings and the @xmath8 binding energy also leads our attention to more details of the model dependence .",
    "we find that the splittings of the pseudospin and spin doublets are almost independent of various combinations of different @xmath143 and @xmath144 for a given @xmath8 binding energy . while we change to other models like the nl - sh  @xcite , we find that the size of the doublet splittings is quantitatively different not only due to various incompressibility at saturation density but also because of the rather different equations of state at suprasaturation densities . nevertheless , the splittings are still very large for light kaonic nuclei",
    ". moreover , we should point out that all results with the nl - sh are qualitatively similar to those obtained from the nl3 , without changing the conclusions drawn above .",
    "ca as a function of @xmath8 binding energy .",
    "@xmath103=0 represents normal @xmath113ca .",
    "[ ls - b ] , width=325,height=226 ]    at last , it is worthy to point out the dependence of the spin or pseudospin doublet splittings on the isospin . with the increase of the neutron number , the repulsion provided by the isovector meson increases .",
    "this causes the moderate reduction of the relevant doublet splittings .",
    "however , the splittings are still well above those for the normal nuclei .",
    "we have investigated the ground - state properties of light kaonic nuclei and the relativistic symmetry breakings with the rmf model . it is found that the relativistic symmetry breakings , underlying potentials associated with the breakings , and the appreciable shrinkage effect , i.e. , the significantly enhanced core density take place consistently due to the strong attraction provided by the @xmath8 embedment in light nuclei . for normal nuclei entertaining the approximate pseudospin symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath8 embedment can enhance @xmath131-dependence of the eigen energies and wave functions , break the original balance between the attractive and repulsive potentials consequently , and result in the pseudospin symmetry breaking and the spin symmetry deterioration . with the @xmath8 embedment , the shell structures are also changed dramatically in light nuclei . in particular",
    ", the migration of @xmath136 orbitals towards the interior fermi sea and the enlarged spin - orbit splittings can reshape the order of energy levels and form new magic numbers .",
    "moreover , we have examined the dependence on the @xmath8 binding energy and the model dependence for these phenomena .",
    "the model dependence is rather weak , and we find that for a large parameter space of the @xmath8 binding energy all the phenomena are quite general .",

    "( [ kg - k ] ) can be written as @xmath146 it is decomposed as @xmath147 with @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "these are second - order differential equations , and can be solved by the runge - kutta method , or the numerov method . in this work ,",
    "the runge - kutta method is adopted .",
