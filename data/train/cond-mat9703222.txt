    "on approaching a critical point , some quantity diverges in the thermodynamic limit with a characteristic critical exponent . the coherent anomaly method ( cam )",
    "has proven quite successful in determining critical exponents from certain sequences of approximations  @xcite .",
    "the cam requires a systematic , or _ canonical _ , sequences of approximations , all of which yield identical , known critical exponents .",
    "the prototypical example is a sequence of mean - field approximations in which successively larger clusters allow more and more fluctuations to be properly taken into account  @xcite ; all of the critical exponents in this example assume their `` classical '' values .",
    "the cam uses the known critical exponents of the approximate systems and the behaviour of the critical _ amplitudes _ as the quality of approximation is improved to determine the true critical exponents of the original system being approximated .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show how sequences of approximations in which the critical points are ill defined and divergences do not occur can be used to construct canonical sequences through extrapolation .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "suppose that in the thermodynamic limit a nonnegative quantity @xmath4 diverges as a system parameter @xmath5 approaches a critical value @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath1 is a critical exponent of unknown value .",
    "the reciprocal of @xmath4 then converges to zero as @xmath8^{-1 }      \\sim ( \\beta_{\\rm c}^ * - \\beta)^\\nu \\ ; .\\ ] ] suppose further that we have a sequence of monotonically decreasing approximations @xmath9 such that @xmath10 by taking two or more consecutive values of @xmath11 , we make an extrapolation @xmath12 which _ intentionally underestimates _ the rate of convergence in @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , these extrapolations will be negative at @xmath6 , and they generically cross zero as @xmath14 for some @xmath15 . for any reasonable extrapolation procedure ( e.g.  power - law extrapolation or exponential extrapolation ) ,",
    "the cam hypothesis , which can be justified on the basis of an envelope argument  @xcite , is that @xmath17 so that , in analogy with , @xmath18 this provides us with a convenient means of measuring @xmath1 . according to ,",
    "a plot of @xmath19 versus @xmath20 should ( in the limit @xmath21 ) be a straight line with slope @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , since all that is required of the extrapolation is that it must underestimate the convergence , we are free to choose an extrapolation which leads to a particularly clear coherent anomaly .",
    "the organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in",
    "we take as @xmath23 the mass gap , i.e. , the reciprocal of the correlation length , as a function of inverse temperature in the square - lattice ising ferromagnet .",
    "this model has the advantage that the correlation length is known analytically  @xcite . in",
    "we analytically study the asymptotic behaviour of the estimated critical exponent if @xmath24 is given by a finite - size scaling function . in we study the critical behaviour of the mass gap in the cubic - lattice ising ferromagnet , and demonstrate that the method works even when @xmath25 . in we study the critical behaviour of the energy gap in an antiferromagnetic spin-1 heisenberg chain with bilinear and biquadratic interactions at the phase transition between the haldane and dimerized phases . in we summarize and discuss possible extensions of this work",
    ".    note that although all of the initial approximations @xmath24 used in this study come from systems that are finite in at least one dimension , this is only to provide convenient examples .",
    "the method itself does not restrict us to such systems .",
    "as the first example , we use the extrapolation - cam method to determine @xmath1 for the classical ising ferromagnet with hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the sum @xmath28 runs over all nearest - neighbour pairs on a periodic square lattice which is of length @xmath29 in the @xmath30-direction and of infinite length in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "the unit of length is the lattice constant .",
    "this model has some very advantageous properties : the mass gaps @xmath32 can be calculated analytically for systems of arbitrary finite width @xmath29 , and the mass gap @xmath23 for the thermodynamic limit of the model can also be calculated analytically  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we can make a detailed comparison of the extrapolation - cam estimates for the critical exponent @xmath1 with its rigourously known value , @xmath0 .    for this model",
    "the variable @xmath5 is the reciprocal of the dimensionless temperature . since it is known that @xmath33 for sufficiently large systems at the critical point  @xcite , we extrapolate by solving @xmath34 for @xmath35 at fixed @xmath5 for @xmath36 .",
    "the result of such an extrapolation is shown in",
    ".    shows @xmath37 vs.  @xmath38 , defined by and , to be a curve with a small slope .",
    "the slope tends to zero as @xmath39 becomes large  that is , when @xmath40 becomes a very good approximation to @xmath6 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath1 from the slope of the line connecting two adjacent points @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this estimate will depend not only on the quality of the initial approximations @xmath43 , but also on the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "we can constrain @xmath44 by taking a third point @xmath45 and demanding that the three points be colinear , so that the value of @xmath46 will be unambiguous .",
    "shows this for values of @xmath1 based on systems with @xmath47 , 9 , 16 , and 25 .",
    "the resulting estimate is @xmath48 , in good agreement with the exact value @xmath0 .",
    "as may be expected , increasing the sizes of the four systems needed to form the estimate of @xmath1 increases the accuracy of @xmath46 . shows the estimated value of @xmath1 vs.  @xmath44 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "the estimate for @xmath54 is @xmath55",
    ". further increase of @xmath56 actually causes the accuracy of the estimate to become worse due to the increasingly large sums required to calculate @xmath57 and @xmath58 and the finite ( eight - byte ) numerical precision of our programs .",
    "the convergence of @xmath46 depends on how the four system sizes are chosen , and can be both complicated and nonmonotonic .",
    "some insight into the dependence of @xmath46 on the system sizes can be gained by assuming that @xmath59 satisfies the scaling equation  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 this assumption is well justified for the systems actually analyzed in this paper , since they all are finite in at least one dimension . in order to be consistent with",
    ", we must have @xmath63 , and @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath65 is the correction - to - scaling amplitude and @xmath66 is the correction - to - scaling exponent , where the correction to scaling is assumed to arise from the leading irrelevant field  @xcite .    for large @xmath67 , yields @xmath68 \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the remainder of this section , we consider @xmath29 to be a single continuous variable and drop the second index @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath70 term in comes from the truncation error in a difference formula approximation of a derivative .",
    "this term can not be neglected if @xmath71 , unless we generalize the extrapolation procedure to allow for a sufficiently high - order difference formula  @xcite ; for the remainder of this section we assume that this is done if necessary and neglect the truncation error .    for the moment",
    ", we set @xmath72 and perform the extrapolation - cam procedure in the absence of corrections to scaling .",
    "it is convenient at this point to use a slightly different definition for @xmath37 , @xmath73 using , we find @xmath74 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left(1 + \\frac{\\omega}{\\theta}\\right )                     \\left[\\ln x - x \\right ] - \\ln",
    "b       + \\ln \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x , b ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we find @xmath75 from the condition @xmath76 , which implies @xmath77 the estimate for @xmath1 is given by calculating @xmath78 while holding both @xmath79 and @xmath44 constant , which is accomplished by holding @xmath31 constant : @xmath80 finally , the `` local straightness '' constraint @xmath81 is simply the identity @xmath82 .",
    "thus without corrections to scaling , the @xmath83 but @xmath31 and @xmath44 are undetermined .",
    "note , however , that if @xmath84 , @xmath85 .    in order to study the effects of corrections to scaling , we could expand and the left - hand side of ( which is proportional to @xmath65 ) in @xmath31 , @xmath30 , and @xmath86 ; then the requirements @xmath87 and @xmath88 yield a pair of equations of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are constants .",
    "the solution of , @xmath92 shows that both @xmath31 and @xmath93 are proportional to @xmath30 . in the same way",
    ", we can expand the left - hand side of in terms of @xmath31 , @xmath30 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the result then is that @xmath94 and @xmath95 privman and fisher have shown that the asymptotic convergence for finite - size scaling renormalisation techniques is also of the form  @xcite ; their discussion of the difficulties in actually observing this asymptotic behaviour should be relevant in the present case as well .",
    "for the two - dimensional ising model , @xmath96 , so we should expect @xmath97 , as indeed seems plausible from .",
    "in three dimensions , the ising model defined by has not been solved analytically , but it has been the subject of a large amount of numerical study .",
    "we use a monte carlo renormalisation group estimate for the critical point of the cubic - lattice ising model , @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "recent estimates of @xmath1 include @xmath99  @xcite , @xmath100  @xcite , and @xmath101  @xcite .    as a result of some earlier studies  @xcite ,",
    "we have transfer - matrix results already available for cubic - lattice ising ferromagnets with periodic boundary conditions and square @xmath102 cross - sections , where @xmath103 . these system sizes are obviously quite small , and are not really competitive with some current methods , such as the transfer - matrix monte carlo method  @xcite .",
    "the method here is basically the same as in the previous section , although we are much more restricted both in the system sizes available and , for @xmath104 , the number of data available . since references  @xcite dealt with phenomena for @xmath105 , we have only a few points @xmath106 with @xmath107 [ see ] .",
    "we use cubic splines to evaluate both @xmath43 and the first @xmath58 as continuous functions .",
    "except at the low-@xmath5 end of the @xmath104 data , we always use `` natural '' boundary conditions on our cubic splines , i.e.   specifying that @xmath108 at the end points of our data .",
    "for the low-@xmath5 end of the @xmath109 spline , we use both natural boundary conditions and `` clamped '' boundary conditions by extrapolating @xmath110 from the smaller system sizes .",
    "there is little difference in @xmath109 itself for these two splines .",
    "we extrapolate @xmath111 using and use , , and to estimate @xmath1 . as shows , the splines yield unreliable estimates near the end of the @xmath109 data . however ,",
    "as long as @xmath112 is reasonably large , the estimates of @xmath1 do not depend on the boundary conditions used for the spline and seem more reliable . choosing five such points and using aitken s @xmath113 method  @xcite   is a part of the name of the numerical method and should not be confused with either @xmath23 or @xmath114 . ] to accelerate the convergence , we extrapolate to @xmath115^{-1 } \\rightarrow   \\infty$ ] , yielding @xmath116 . given the very small systems used in this estimate , this is in good agreement with other recent estimates of @xmath1 .",

    "the spectrum of this hamiltonian has been exactly solved for at @xmath122 using bethe - ansatz techniques , and the resulting energy spectrum is gapless  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian has also been found  @xcite for even values of @xmath29 at @xmath123 , and the gap above it has been proven to be nonvanishing .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that @xmath122 marks a phase transition between the gapped haldane phase  @xcite and the gapped dimerized phase , and that this phase transition is in the same universality class as the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "these arguments have been supported numerically  @xcite .",
    "shows the estimates @xmath43 obtained by exact diagonalization of small systems .",
    "the finite - size effects are quite strong , and we were unable to make an extrapolation of the form , since we require @xmath124 for all extrapolations in order for @xmath38 and @xmath37 to be real and finite .",

    ", @xmath114 can very generally be expected to cross zero linearly with @xmath5 .",
