    "over the past decade it has become apparent that many early - type galaxies are genuinely three - dimensional objects , neither spherical nor axisymmetric ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) that they typically have a central density cusp ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) and that the center of the galaxy often contains a supermassive black hole ( _ cf . _ @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is substantial numerical evidence ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) that the combination of triaxiality and a cusp typically yields potentials that admit a large amount of chaos ; and there is also evidence indicating that the introduction of a supermassive black hole into a cuspy , triaxial potential causes a further increase in the abundance of chaos ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "numerical explorations indicate further ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) that the phase space associated with a cuspy triaxial potential , either with or without a black hole , can be very complex , laced with an intricate arnold web that can seriously impede phase space transport , so that chaotic orbits in these potentials can be very ` sticky ' in the sense recognised originally by contopoulos .    however , there are at least two important questions which have not yet been addressed adequately . why does the combination of triaxiality and a cusp and/or black hole lead to chaos ? and to what extent is the observed behaviour generic ?",
    "almost all work hitherto has focused on one class of model potentials , namely the triaxial generalisations of the spherical dehnen potentials first considered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that a black hole or cusp tends to induce chaos because it serves as a near - singular perturbation that destabilises what would be regular box orbits if the galaxy had a smooth core and there were no black hole .",
    "this seems quite reasonable .",
    "however , @xcite have noted a fact well known from nonlinear dynamics ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) , namely that chaos often arises simply by breaking a symmetry or combining incompatible symmetries .",
    "one might therefore argue that a supermassive black hole acts as a source of chaos because of symmetry - breaking : the unperturbed galaxy is triaxial , whereas the perturbation manifests spherical symmetry .",
    "this could , _",
    "e.g. _ , account for the fact that , as a source of chaos , even a comparatively low mass black hole can be more important than a steep cusp . as @xcite noted , ` even a modest black hole , with a mass @xmath7 the mass of the galaxy , is as effective as the steepest central density cusp at inducing stochastic diffusion . ' in any event , one knows that a black hole or cusp does not always result in chaos . by carefully maintaining symmetries , one can , _",
    "e.g. _ , construct integrable generalisations of the staeckel potentials which incorporate a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "one objective here is to address the question of why cusps and black holes induce chaos by studying orbits in an extremely simple class of potentials which appear to exhibit behaviour qualitatively similar to what is observed the triaxial dehnen potentials with or without a black hole .",
    "the potential , @xmath8 with @xmath2 , is the sum of an anisotropic harmonic potential and a spherical plummer potential .",
    "there are five parameters which can be varied independently , namely @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , which determine the frequencies and the shape of the unperturbed oscillator , @xmath4 , the mass of the black hole , and the softening length @xmath5 .",
    "that much of the behaviour exhibited by orbits in the triaxial dehnen potentials can be reproduced by such a simple model suggests that it may be generic .",
    "that the model is so simple implies that it is amenable to an analytic treatment with the black hole viewed as a perturbation of the integrable oscillator potential .",
    "the numerical component of the analysis focuses on three important characterisations of the chaos : ( 1 ) what fraction of the orbits are chaotic ? ( 2 ) how large is the largest lyapunov exponent associated with the chaotic orbits ? ( 3 ) how ` sticky ' are the chaotic orbits ?",
    "can they travel relatively unimpeded throughout the accessible phase space , or is their motion obstructed significantly by the arnold web ?    the relative abundance of chaotic orbits is important given the general presumption that one requires a substantial number of regular , or nearly regular , orbits to serve as a skeleton for the equilibrium ( _ cf_. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the degree of sensitivity exhibited by orbits is important because it impacts on the efficacy of chaotic mixing ( _ cf_. @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of `` sticky '' orbits is of potential importance because these orbits can in principal be used to support regular structures in phase space regions where few , if any , regular orbits exist ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .    determining the answers to these questions as functions of the axis ratio @xmath3 and",
    "the black hole mass @xmath4 provides information about how the manifestations of chaos vary with the degree of triaxiality and the mass of the black hole .",
    "determining the effects of varying @xmath5 can shed insights into why the chaos arises . for sufficiently small softening ,",
    "the exact value of @xmath5 is immaterial , but when @xmath5 becomes too large its value begins to have an important effect .",
    "if the only function of the black hole were to act as a near - singular perturbation , one might expect that , for ensembles of orbits with fixed energy @xmath6 , unperturbed frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and softening @xmath5 , the relative abundance of chaotic orbits should exhibit a very simple dependence on @xmath4 . for @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "the potential is integrable .",
    "however , for other values @xmath14 is nonintegrable and , for intermediate values far from @xmath12 and @xmath15 , one might expect large measures of chaotic orbits .",
    "in particular , one might expect that a plot of @xmath16 , the relative measure of chaotic orbits , as a function of @xmath4 would exhibit a single maximum at an intermediate value where @xmath4 is neither too small nor too large . this is",
    "_ not _ what the numerical simulations reveal .",
    "rather , one finds that the abundance of chaos varies in a more irregular fashion which , as discussed in section 2 , would suggest that chaos arises from a resonance overlap between the natural frequencies of the oscillator and the black hole .",
    "section 2 of this paper focuses on the statistical properties of short time lyapunov exponents .",
    "section 3 summarises an analysis that focused primarily on the fourier spectra of both individual orbits and orbit ensembles .",
    "section 4 concludes by summarising the results of sections 2 and 3 and commenting on their physical implications .",
    "most of the experiments focused on the statistical properties of ensembles of orbits evolved for comparatively short times",
    ". however , these were supplemented by very long time integrations of individual initial conditions used to extract estimates of the values of the largest lyapunov exponents for fixed values of frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , mass @xmath4 , softening @xmath5 , and energy @xmath6 .",
    "three different questions were addressed :    \\1 . for fixed @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 , how do things depend on @xmath5 ?",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath5 , the precise value is immaterial but for larger @xmath5 this is no longer true .",
    "\\2 . for fixed @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ,",
    "how do things depend on @xmath4 ?",
    "the most naive picture might suggest that @xmath16 , the relative measure of chaotic orbits , should vary smoothly with @xmath4 and that a plot of @xmath17 as a function of @xmath4 should exhibit no structure .    \\3 .",
    "for fixed @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 , how do things depend on the axis ratio @xmath3 ?",
    "conventional wisdom would suggest that larger deviations from spherical symmetry imply more chaos , so that one might expect the relative abundance of chaos to increase monotonically with increasing asphericity .",
    "the experiments were performed for frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath18 and energies @xmath19 , this corresponding physically to a galaxy of mass @xmath20 , linear size @xmath21 , and characteristical orbital , or dynamical , time scale @xmath22 . the black hole mass was taken in the range @xmath23 .",
    "smaller black hole masses are not large enough to induce significant stochasticity ; much larger masses seem completely unrealistic .    for parameters in these general ranges ,",
    "the exact value of @xmath5 seems unimportant , provided only that @xmath24 or so . for this reason ,",
    "most of the experiments were performed assuming @xmath25 , the same value used in siopis & kandrup ( 2000 ) .",
    "a ` typical ' choice of frequencies was @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , corresponding to a moderately triaxial configuration .    for fixed frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , mass @xmath4 , and energy @xmath6 ,",
    "the value of the largest lyapunov exponent was estimated by selecting six or more initial conditions corresponding to chaotic orbits and integrating each initial condition for a total time @xmath29 while simultaneously tracking the evolution of a small initial perturbation periodically renormalised in the usual way ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the relative abundance of chaotic orbits was estimated by sampling the phase space to generate a collection of @xmath30 initial conditions and evolving each of these initial conditions , along with a small perturbation , for a time @xmath31 which , for the energies considered here , corresponded to @xmath32 . the value of the largest short time lyapunov exponent @xmath33 ( _ cf .",
    "_ grassberger _ et al _ 1988 ) was then used as a diagnostic to determine whether or not the initial condition was chaotic .",
    "( integrations for shorter times would seem better motivated astronomically , but it was found that , for much smaller @xmath34 , it was often impossible to determine with any reliability whether or not any given segment corresponded to a chaotic orbit . indeed , even for integrations for times as long as @xmath31 it is possible that some very sticky chaotic segments were misinterpreted as regular segments ! ) the initial conditions were generated as in @xcite , using a scheme which generalises schwarzschild s algorithm to construct a representative library of orbits .",
    "the resulting short time @xmath33 s were examined to determine three things , namely ( 1 ) the relative number of chaotic orbits ; ( 2 ) the degree to which different chaotic orbit segments with the same energy do , or do not , have the same short time @xmath33 s , and ( 3 ) the degree to which all the chaotic segments are characterised by short time @xmath33 s well separated from zero .",
    "the behaviour of orbit segments over shorter , more astronomically relevant , time scales was addressed by partitioning each of the @xmath30 segments of length @xmath31 into eight segments of length @xmath35 and extracting a short time lyapunov exponent for each segment ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath36 segments were analysed to determine a distribution of short time lyapunov exponents , @xmath37 $ ] , which probes the varying degrees of chaos exhibited by a representative collection of orbits , both regular and chaotic , over an interval of time comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "finally , as another probe of the total amount of chaos , independent of distinctions amongst regular , sticky , and wildly chaotic orbits , the output was analysed to extract the average short time lyapunov exponent for _ all _ the orbits in each ensemble .",
    "most of the experiments focused on three representative energies , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "a variety of axis ratios were considered .",
    "one set of experiments involved considering frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for which @xmath41 and exploring the effects of increasing @xmath42 .",
    "the black hole acts as an important source of chaos whenever conditions are such that the force that it exerts on a test particle often becomes comparable to the force associated with the oscillator . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "a mass @xmath43 appears required to induce an appreciable amount of obvious chaos .",
    "the precise value of @xmath5 seems unimportant provided only that @xmath5 is very small compared with the characteristic size of a stellar orbit .",
    "if the black hole mass be frozen at some value @xmath4 significantly above @xmath44 and @xmath5 increased systematically , chaos remains common until the maximum black hole force @xmath45 becomes smaller than a characteristic value somewhat less than unity , this corresponding to the typical force exerted by the oscillator .",
    "it thus appears that it is not the singular character of the perturbation _",
    "per se _ that is responsible for triggering chaos ; rather what is important is that the force associated with the black hole can become comparable to , or larger than , the force associated with the unperturbed oscillator .",
    "in other words , mixing two integrable potentials of comparable strength is responsible for the chaos .",
    "-0.3in-0.0 in    one example of how the amount of chaos depends on @xmath5 is provided by figure  [ fig1 ] , each panel of which exhibits the computed short time @xmath46 for a collection of @xmath30 initial conditions evolved in the potential ( 1 ) with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 with fixed energy @xmath38 .",
    "each panel was constructed by computing @xmath30 short time @xmath33 s , ordering the orbits in terms of the computed @xmath33 , and then ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite ) plotting the resulting @xmath33 s as a function of particle number from @xmath51 to @xmath30 . the six panels exhibit data for values of @xmath5 ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the computed @xmath33 s for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are virtually identical . for @xmath57 chaos is weaker in two senses , namely that the relative number of chaotic orbits is smaller _ and _ that the typical @xmath33 associated with a chaotic orbit has also decreased . for @xmath52 , chaos is almost completely suppressed . for @xmath58 , there are a few orbits with somewhat larger @xmath33 s than was observed for @xmath59 , @xmath55 , and @xmath60 , each corresponding to a particle which passed extremely close to the black hole .",
    "-0.3in-0.0 in    -0.3in-0.0 in    overall , chaotic orbits tend to be extremely sticky .",
    "in particular , even for @xmath61 or larger , the computed values of @xmath33 need not manifest a clear and unambiguous separation between regular and chaotic behaviour .",
    "if , as in figure 1 , an ordered list of @xmath33 s is plotted as a function of particle number , there is in general no clean break between the regular and chaotic orbits . oftentimes the only way to infer a reasonable demarcation between regular and chaotic behaviour is to look for a ` kink ' in the slope .",
    "however , the relative abundance of regular / nearly regular as opposed to wildly chaotic orbits _ can _ be extracted by examining distributions of short time lyapunov exponents , @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "typical examples of such distributions are provided in figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] , which exhibit @xmath62 $ ] for @xmath35 and @xmath31 for the @xmath30 orbit ensembles evolved with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath63 , and @xmath38 with variable black hole masses ranging between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    in each of these panels ,",
    "the data were so plotted that the horizontal axis terminates at the right at a value @xmath66 corresponding to the largest value of @xmath67 assumed by any of the @xmath36 segments .",
    "it is thus evident that , for small @xmath4 , there are a very few orbits with comparatively large values of @xmath33 , even though the overwhelming majority of the orbits have much smaller values .",
    "for relatively large values of @xmath4 , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath68 , there are comparable numbers of both regular / nearly regular and wildly chaotic orbits . for somewhat lower values",
    ", the abundance of wildly chaotic orbits tends to decrease with increasing @xmath4 , although the trend is not completely uniform .",
    "thus , _ e.g. _ , there are more wildly chaotic orbits for @xmath69 and @xmath70 than for @xmath71 .    for small values of @xmath4 , it becomes exceedingly difficult to estimate the fraction of the orbits which are truly chaotic .",
    "in particular , for @xmath72 and less , the distribution @xmath73 $ ] manifests a single sharp peak at a value close to zero .",
    "this might suggest that the orbits are all regular ; but @xmath73 $ ] also has a tail extending to much larger values which is clearly indicative of chaos .",
    "one possible interpretation is that , _ for small",
    "@xmath4 , many / all of the orbits are in fact chaotic , but that most of these chaotic orbits behave in a near - regular fashion almost all of the time_. for @xmath12 , each initial condition corresponds to a regular box orbit which densely fills a region in configuration space that includes the origin .",
    "one might perhaps expect that , for sufficiently small @xmath4 , the orbits remain `` nearly boxy '' and again follow trajectories which occasionally bring them arbitrarily close to the origin . in the limit @xmath74",
    ", one would thus anticipate that every orbit eventually experiences perturbations of arbitrarily large amplitude which trigger chaotic behaviour .",
    "making @xmath5 finite introduces a bound to the perturbing force but , for @xmath5 as small as @xmath75 , the value used here , this still corresponds to a maximum force of amplitude @xmath76 .",
    "-2.3in-0.0 in    -0.3in-0.0 in    [ fig5 ]    this interpretation is corroborated by the fact that similar distributions of short time lyapunov exponents can be generated from a single initial condition integrated for very long times .",
    "specifically , if a single initial condition with the same energy be integrated for a time @xmath77 and short time exponents computed separately for each @xmath35 segment , the resulting @xmath73 $ ] is often nearly indistinguishable from the @xmath73 $ ] generated from an ensemble of initial conditions .",
    "this is , _",
    "e.g. _ , evident from figure  [ fig4 ] , which exhibits distributions generated for two different initial conditions with @xmath38 integrated with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "each initial condition was integrated for a total time @xmath80 with energy conserved to better than one part in @xmath81 .",
    "one corresponded at early times to a wildly chaotic orbit with @xmath82 ; the other corresponded initially to a very ` sticky , ' near - regular orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] exhibits estimates of @xmath33 , the largest lyapunov exponent , and @xmath16 , the relative fraction of obviously chaotic orbits , as functions of @xmath4 for representative ensembles computed with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath78 for three different energies , namely @xmath38 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "only the data for @xmath85 are exhibited since , as noted above , for smaller values it becomes extremely difficult to determine whether any given orbit is regular or chaotic .",
    "however , it _ does _ seem clear that there is little or no chaos when the black hole mass is as small as @xmath86 , and that there is a comparatively rapid increase in the importance of chaos for @xmath87 .",
    "this rapid increase is probably not generic .",
    "rather , as discussed in section 4 , the fact that chaos appears to ` turn on ' abruptly likely reflects the fact that , for this potential , all the unperturbed ( @xmath12 ) orbits with fixed energy @xmath6 have exactly the same natural frequencies and densely sample the same region in configuration space , so that ` if you ve seen one orbit you ve seen them all . '",
    "if the black hole mass be increased from @xmath88 to larger values , the overall abundance of chaos tends to decrease .",
    "however , this decrease is _ not _ completely uniform . for all three energies",
    ", one observes a pronounced spike in the distribution @xmath16 where the relative measure of chaotic orbits increases abruptly .",
    "the existence of these spikes indicates that the relative abundance of chaos does not exhibit a completely trivial dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that the locations of these spikes varies smoothly with energy suggests strongly that this nontrivial variation is a resonance phenomenon .",
    "similarly , for fixed @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , the largest lyapunov exponent , as defined in an asymptotic @xmath89 limit , does not exhibit a completely trivial dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , @xmath33 is not a monotonically increasing function of @xmath4 .",
    "however , for ensembles integrated for times @xmath90 , it appears that the largest short time exponents observed for any of the orbits _ do _ increase monotonically with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that , for certain ranges of @xmath4 , the asymptotic @xmath33 decreases reflects the fact that , for these values of @xmath4 , it is especially likely for a chaotic orbit to be ` nearly regular ' for long times , during which the short time @xmath33 is comparatively small .",
    "that the locations of these ` dips ' varies smoothly with energy again suggests that some resonance phenomenon has come into play .",
    "-0.0in-0.0 in    overall , chaos seems to become more pronounced for larger deviations from axisymmetry but , once again , the trend is not completely uniform .",
    "rather , it is again possible to observe dips and/or spikes in the relative measure of chaotic orbits .",
    "this is , _",
    "e.g. _ , illustrated by figure  [ fig6 ] , which exhibits @xmath91 , the mean value of the largest lyapunov exponent , @xmath92 , the associated dispersion , and @xmath17 , the relative abundance of strongly chaotic orbits for sequences of models with fixed @xmath6 , @xmath50 , @xmath78 , and @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "the two left panels were computed for ensembles with @xmath38 ; the two right panels were computed for @xmath83 .",
    "the experiments described here aimed to provide additional insights into the origins of chaos in the potential ( 1 ) by examining the fourier spectra of representative orbits and orbit ensembles ; testing the validity of a perturbative analysis which views @xmath95 as a perturbation of the unperturbed oscillator potential ; and examining how , for individual orbits , the degree of instability exhibited at different points correlates with the location of the orbit in configuration space .",
    "two classes of experiments were considered .",
    "the first involved computing fourier spectra for each orbit in several of the ensembles described in the preceding section .",
    "this facilitated an improved understanding of how various orbits with the same @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 can differ one from another .",
    "the other class of experiments explored the question of how , for a fixed set of initial conditions , evolved with the same choices of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath5 , varying the central mass @xmath4 impacts bulk statistical properties .",
    "this entailed selecting fifty representative phase space points , uniformly sampling the interval @xmath96 , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 so chosen that @xmath38 for @xmath50 ; and then evolving these into the future for a time @xmath31 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath78 , varying the black hole mass incrementally from @xmath12 to @xmath99 in steps of @xmath100 .",
    "an analysis of the resulting fourier spectra facilitated a quantitative characterisation of the extent to which perturbation theory correctly predicts changes in frequencies .",
    "a comparison of short time lyapunov exponents and properties of the fourier spectra for the orbits corroborated the expectation that , as for other two- and three - dimensional potentials ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) , orbit segments with larger lyapunov exponents typically have more ` complex ' fourier spectra , with substantial power at a larger number of different frequencies .    the notion of ` complexity ' exploited here differs slightly from that adopted in earlier papers . in those papers , the complexity @xmath101 was defined as the number of frequencies required in a discrete fourier spectrum to capture a fixed fraction @xmath102 of the total power . here",

    "that perturbation theory is more successful overall in accounting for regular and nearly regular orbit segments than for wildly chaotic segments is evident from the second panel in figure  [ fig10 ] , which plots @xmath128 $ ] , the distribution of relative errors . that the distribution is sharply bimodal is consistent with the fact that , as regards the success of perturbation theory , the orbits divide into two distinct populations , one , comprised mostly of regular orbits , for which perturbation theory is quite reliable , and another , comprised mostly of wildly chaotic orbits , for which perturbation theory works somewhat less well .",
    "-0.4in-0.0 in    but precisely _ why _ does the observed chaos actually arise ? a detailed examination of the local stability of individual orbits provides a simple and compelling answer .",
    "when an orbit is far from the center , the central mass @xmath4 has only a comparatively minimal effect and the orbit is nearly regular .",
    "however , when the orbit comes too close to the center and @xmath4 contributes significantly to the total potential experienced by the orbit , the combination of the incompatible symmetries leads to a resonance overlap and a significant exponential instability .",
    "this is , _",
    "e.g. _ , illustrated in figure  [ fig11 ] , which exhibits a representative piece of a wildly chaotic orbit segment with @xmath129 evolved in the potential ( 1 ) with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath130 . here",
    "the solid curve in the top panel displays the phase space separation @xmath131 between the original orbit and a perturbed orbit displaced originally by a distance @xmath132 and renormalised in the usual way ( _ cf . _ @xcite @xcite ) at intervals @xmath133 .",
    "the dashed curve shows an analogous plot of @xmath134 for a regular orbit .",
    "the bottom panel exhibits @xmath135 , the distance from the origin ( solid curve ) , and @xmath136 , the magnitude of the central mass perturbation .",
    "the obvious point is that most of the time the perturbed and unperturbed orbit remain very close together , with little if any systematic exponential divergence ; but that when @xmath137 or so , so that @xmath138 becomes as large as @xmath139 , the two orbits tend to diverge significantly .    in this context",
    ", it should be noted that , even for the orbits which have been characterised as ` wildly chaotic , ' the computed lyapunov exponents are comparatively small when expressed in units of @xmath140 . for ` generic ' chaotic potentials ,",
    "one discovers typically that the largest lyapunov exponent typically assumes a value @xmath141 which , for @xmath22 , implies values of @xmath33 in excess of @xmath142 or so .",
    "however , only for very large central masses , @xmath143 or so , did any of the computed orbit segments have values of @xmath33 as large as @xmath142 .",
    "even the so - called wildly chaotic orbits tend to be comparatively regular most of the time , the observed chaos resulting from those comparatively rare intervals when the orbits come comparatively close to the central mass .",
    "the stickiness manifested by chaotic orbits in the potential explored in this paper is strikingly reminiscent of what has been observed for the triaxial analogues of the dehnen potentials ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) , especially for those orbits which , in the absence of the cusp and/or black hole , would correspond to box orbits . introducing a cusp and/or a supermassive black hole into an otherwise smooth triaxial potential",
    "can generate a considerable amount of chaos , but individual orbit segments can be very nearly regular for very long times .",
    "stickiness appears to be a more important phenomenon in cuspy triaxial potentials , both with and without a central black hole , than in many other chaotic three - dimensional potentials .",
    "the numerical experiments described in section 2  especially the fact that quantities like the relative measure of chaotic , as opposed to regular , orbits can manifest a nontrivial dependence on both @xmath4 and axis ratio  suggests strongly that the chaos associated with this potential results from a resonance overlap between the natural frequencies of the unperturbed oscillator and the natural frequencies of the central black hole .",
    "an examination of the local stability of individual orbits indicates that , for intermediate black hole masses , the orbits are only very unstable when they are sufficiently close to the black hole that @xmath144 and @xmath138 become comparable in magnitude . the computations for this simple potential thus corroborate the conclusions of @xcite based on a detailed investigation of the spectral properties of orbits in the triaxial dehnen potentials .",
    "however , it is also evident that the chaos arises in response to a combination of incompatible symmetries : the plummer and oscillator potentials are each integrable separately but , when combined with comparable magnitudes , can yield strongly chaotic behaviour .",
    "the simplicity of the potential ( 1 ) was important because it made possible the analytic calculations described in section 3 .",
    "however , this potential _ is _ artificial in the sense that , for fixed energy @xmath6 , every orbit unperturbed by a central black hole has the same natural frequencies , a fact that renders the conclusions of the paper anomalous in two significant respects : ( 1 ) as is clear , _",
    "e.g. _ , from figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] , as @xmath4 increases there is an extremely abrupt transition from a phase space hypersurface with essentially no chaos to a phase space that is almost completely chaotic . if the harmonic oscillator component of the potential is replaced by an anharmonic oscillator , _",
    "e.g. _ , by allowing for quartic corrections , the natural frequencies of different unperturbed orbits with the same energy are no longer identical , and one would anticipate the transition from little chaos to much chaos to become more gradual .",
    "( 2 ) if the oscillator is made anharmonic , the nontrivial structures exhibited by @xmath16 and @xmath145 might also be expected to disappear . because an ensemble of fixed energy now involves",
    "unperturbed orbits with different frequencies , a plot of @xmath16 can be understood as involving a nontrivial superposition of orbits with different unperturbed frequencies .",
    "these expectations were confirmed by repeating the computations described in this paper for orbits in the generalised potential @xmath146 @xmath147 for a variety of different values of @xmath148 .",
    "data for the representative value @xmath149 are exhibited in figure  [ fig12 ] . here",
    "the first panel exhibits the mean @xmath91 and dispersion @xmath92 for @xmath30 orbit ensembles with @xmath38 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath25 for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "the second panel exhibits the same quantities for ensembles with @xmath38 , @xmath50 , @xmath25 , and @xmath93 for different values of @xmath42 .",
    "it is evident from panel ( a ) that that the transition to chaos is more gradual than was observed in the harmonic potential .",
    "moreover , only for black hole masses somewhat smaller than @xmath86 do all the orbits seem completely regular . and similarly",
    ", it is clear that @xmath91 and @xmath92 vary smoothly with @xmath4 and @xmath42 , the resonant behaviour observed for @xmath150 having washed out because the ensembles now involve unperturbed orbits with a variety of frequencies .",
    "the hamiltonian appropriate for motion in the potential ( 1 ) can be written in the form @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is integrable and @xmath153 may be viewed as a perturbation that breaks integrability . because the integrable component @xmath154 is separable ,",
    "it is easy to compute the generating functional @xmath155 , which can be written as @xmath156 where @xmath157 denote the actions and the index @xmath158 ranges over @xmath106 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . given @xmath159 , it is easy to relate the original canonical variables to the actions @xmath157 and a corresponding set of angles @xmath160 , in terms of which the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath151 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 @xmath163}^{-1/2 } .\\ ] ] at this stage , one needs to perform a triple integral , averaging each of the three angles over the range @xmath164 .",
    "unfortunately , however , this is difficult to do in closed form",
    ". nevertheless , one can proceed perturbatively by expanding @xmath165 in a taylor series around some point @xmath166 .",
    "the result of such a computation is that the perturbed frequencies @xmath167 satisfy @xmath168}{\\biggr ] } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is natural to choose the @xmath169 s at or near values for which @xmath170 , for which values the magnitude of @xmath165 is minimised .",
