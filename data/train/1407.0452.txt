    "the homogeneity in photometric properties of normal type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) is expected to be related to common physical properties during the onset of thermonuclear explosions in the progenitor white dwarfs with a mass close to chandrasekhar s limiting mass ( * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "the continuum light from normal sne ia is intrinsically weakly polarized ( @xmath4% ) , although the absorption features , including 6355 and ir triplets , are often polarized by @xmath5@xmath6% @xcite .",
    "in fact , a 6355 absorption line with a polarization of @xmath7% and an equivalent width of @xmath8 m ( for sn  2014j near the maximum ) gives an additional polarization of only @xmath9% for typical @xmath10 band polarimetry ( @xmath11 m ) .",
    "this practically allows us to use sne ia as a unique bright unpolarized - light source within distant galaxies for broadband polarimetry .",
    "thus , a sn ia has the potential to project the interstellar polarization ( isp ) along the line of sight inside the host galaxy when subject to a substantial amount of interstellar reddening , as is commonly seen in our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sn  2014j is the closest sn ia in this quarter century .",
    "it was discovered in m82 ( at a distance @xmath12 mpc ; @xcite ) on 2014 jan 21.81 ( ut dates are used throughout this letter ) at a magnitude of @xmath13 mag @xcite , probably a week after the explosion @xcite .",
    "the apparent brightness provides us with an opportunity for various studies , including constraining early light curve model @xcite , studying progenitor systems @xcite , and evaluating properties of extragalactic interstellar / circumstellar media @xcite .",
    "in addition , this sn provides a rare opportunity to probe the isp within the starburst galaxy m82 because it suffers significant reddening from the host galaxy ( @xmath14 mag ) .",
    "prior to sn  2014j , there were only three reddened sne ia ( @xmath15 mag ) for which the wavelength dependence of optical polarization had been measured , which are sn 1986 g in the peculiar giant s0 galaxy ngc 5128 ( cen a ) ( @xcite ; @xmath16 mag and @xmath17 mpc ) , sn 2006x in the virgo cluster spiral galaxy ngc 4321 ( @xcite ; @xmath18@xmath19 mag and @xmath20 mpc ) , and sn 2008fp in the peculiar spiral galaxy eso 428-g14 ( @xcite ; @xmath21 mag and @xmath22 mpc ) .",
    "the galactic isp at ultraviolet ( uv ) to near - infrared ( nir ) wavebands can be approximated by serkowski law ( @xcite ) , a smooth function of wavelength given by @xmath23 \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the peak polarization degree occurring at wavelength @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a parameter describing the width of the peak .",
    "the polarization observed for sne 1986 g and 2006x can be described by serkowski law at optical wavelengths ; however , the derived parameters are peculiar , i.e. , the wavelengths @xmath27 m ( sn 1986 g ) and @xmath28 m ( sn 2006x ) are significantly shorter than the galactic value ( @xmath29 m ; @xcite ) , and @xmath30 ( sn 2006x ) is not consistent with the value expected from the wilking law , i.e. , @xmath31 , for the galactic isp ( @xcite ) .",
    "sn 2008fp exhibits interstellar polarization similar to the downscaled one of sn 2006x @xcite . for the galactic isp",
    ", this @xmath25@xmath26 correlation may be interpreted as a narrowing in the size distribution with grain growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the shorter @xmath25 with these sne suggests that the size of the dust grains polarizing light in the host galaxies is , on average , smaller than those in the milkyway .",
    "this is also consistent with the smaller values of the total - to - selective extinction ratio , i.e. , @xmath32@xmath33 , obtained for some reddened sne ia ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if the empirical relation of galactic isp , @xmath34 @xcite , still holds for small @xmath25 , the observed values of @xmath35@xmath33 corresponds to @xmath36@xmath37 m , which is comparable with @xmath25 observed in sne 1986 g and 2006x .    in this letter , we report our @xmath38 polarimetry of sn  2014j before and after the maximum light , along with our photometric and spectroscopic observations . such multi - band polarimetry including nir bands for reddened sne ia is still quite rare , and therefore this sn may provide us a valuable information on the interstellar and/or circumstellar media along the line of sight toward sn  2014j within m82 .",
    "we performed imaging polarimetry of sn  2014j using hiroshima one - shot wide - field polarimeter ( howpol ; @xcite ) on 2014 jan 22.4 ( @xmath39 days relative to the @xmath1-band maximum light ; see  [ subsec : phot_spec ] ) in @xmath40 bands and hiroshima optical and near ir camera ( honir ; @xcite ) in @xmath38 bands on jan 27.7 ( @xmath41 days ) , feb 16.5 ( @xmath42 days ) , 25.6 ( @xmath43 days ) and mar 7.8 ( @xmath44 days ) .",
    "howpol employs a wedged double wollaston prism , and is attached to the nasmyth focus of the 1.5  m kanata telescope at higashi - hiroshima observatory .",
    "honir uses a cooled liyf@xmath45 wollaston prism and is attached to the cassegrain focus of the same telescope .",
    "each observation consisted of a sequence of exposures at four position angles ( pas ) of the achromatic half - wave plates , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for the howpol and the last honir observations , and at four pas of the instrumental rotator at the cassegrain focus of the telescope , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for the first three honir observations .",
    "these data were calibrated using observations of unpolarized ( hd  94851 , hd  98281 ) and polarized standard stars ( hd  30168 , hd  150193 , hde  283701 , cyg  ob  2 # 11 ; @xcite ) , including measurements through a fully - polarizing filter or a wire grid . using this procedure , the instrumental polarization ( @xmath54% in honir and @xmath55@xmath56% in howpol )",
    "was vectorially removed .",
    "in addition , we obtained photometry using howpol ( @xmath57 ) , and honir ( @xmath38 ) attached to the 1.5-m kanata telescope , with mitsume @xcite ( @xmath58 ) attached to the 0.5  m telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) of national astronomical observatory of japan , with a peltier - cooled ccd ( @xmath57 ) attached to the 0.51  m telescope at osaka kyoiku university ( oku ) , and with isle @xcite ( @xmath59 ) attached to the 1.88  m telescope at oao , respectively .",
    "the magnitude in each band was determined relative to the nearby comparison star , bd+70@xmath60587 , which was flux - calibrated in @xmath57 bands using landolt field stars @xcite on a photometric night . for nir photometry , we used @xmath59 magnitudes of the same star in 2mass second incremental release point source catalogue .",
    "we also collected low - resolution spectra with howpol ( 0.410.94 @xmath61 m , @xmath62 ) and honir ( 0.52.3 @xmath61 m , @xmath63@xmath64 ) on the 1.5-m kanata telescope .",
    "the flux was calibrated using observations of spectrophotometric standard stars obtained on the same nights .    because sn  2014j is superimposed within the bright region of m82 and we can not perform template subtraction in image reduction",
    ", the obtained flux should be more or less contaminated by the inhomogeneity and irregularity of the surface brightness of m82 .",
    "however , the sn itself is sufficiently bright , and the polarizations obtained during the period from @xmath65 days to @xmath66 days from the maximum light should suffer minor effects from the galaxy light .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the obtained multi - band light curves ( lcs ) .",
    "the apparent maximum magnitudes in @xmath67 bands are found to be @xmath68 mag on mjd 56690.4@xmath69 ( feb 2.4@xmath69 ) and @xmath70 mag on mjd 56691.7@xmath69 , respectively , as derived by a polynomial fit to the observed data around the maximum light .",
    "we also derived the observed @xmath1-band magnitude decline rate @xmath71 mag .",
    "for the extinction toward sn  2014j , @xcite estimated the total reddening of @xmath72 mag and @xmath73 based on analysis of near - maximum - light spectral energy distribution from uv to nir wavebands .",
    "this reddening is apparently dominated by the host galaxy component @xmath74 , because the ir dustmap suggests that the galactic component is only @xmath75 mag @xcite .",
    "we corrected for the extinction using the @xmath76 and @xmath77 values and the parameterized extinction curve @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of @xmath78 mag and @xmath79 mag , as well as its color , are consistent with the empirical relations with @xmath80 within errors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting the photometric behavior in sn  2014j is not anomalous .",
    "we set the time of the @xmath1 band maximum as @xmath81 days , which is @xmath82 days after the epoch of the estimated first light @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows a time series of spectra from @xmath65 days to @xmath83 days . compared with the normal sn ia 2011fe , sn  2014j",
    "is characterized by the absence of spectral features due to 6580 and 7774 , as well as the existence of high - velocity components in ir triplet ( @xmath84 km s@xmath85 ) during the earliest phase @xmath86 days , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the line velocity and equivalent width of 6355 around maximum ( @xmath87 days ) are @xmath88 km s@xmath85 ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] inset panel ) and @xmath89  , respectively , which are marginal between those of ` normal ' and ` hv ' sne @xcite .",
    "however , the relation between @xmath90-corrected @xmath91 and @xmath92 yielded in sn  2014j ( @xmath93 mag for @xmath91 and @xmath94 mag for @xmath92 ) is apparently consistent with the branch of hv group ( @xmath95 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nearly constant absorption strength ( up to @xmath96 months after discovery ) of the interstellar d lines and diffuse interstellar bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the dust responsible for the extinction towards sn  2014j is located at a site moderately separated from the progenitor ( @xmath97 cm ) .",
    "the observed polarization is shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the polarization is relatively strong in blue bands , e.g. , reaching @xmath98% in @xmath1 band , and it decreases rapidly with wavelength , while the polarization pa is approximately constant at around @xmath2 . in nir bands ,",
    "the polarization is less significant ( @xmath99% ) ; however , it is likely that the same polarization component still dominates because of having almost the same pa as the optical bands .",
    "there is no significant temporal variation in the polarization measured during the period from @xmath65 days to @xmath66 days from the maximum light , and the polarization in optical bands appears to be consistent with the result of spectropolarimetry covering wavelengths from 380 to 880 nm @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we discuss only the averaged polarization ( table [ tbl : pol_sn14j ] ) .",
    "the large polarization measured for sn  2014j suggests that it is predominantly produced within m82 , because the galactic isp is , at most , 0.18% according to the measurements of six galactic stars in the vicinity of sn  2014j within @xmath100 of the all - sky polarization map @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the almost constant polarization during the period of our observation would exclude the possibility that it is originated in the close proximity to the progenitor .",
    "this , together with the unchanged interstellar absorption lines , favors that that the significant polarization of sn  2014j is caused by dust grains at a site remote from the sn .",
    "it has been suggested that multiple scattering due to circumstellar ( cs ) dust may account for half of the total extinction @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that the cs dust could not be the principal origin of the observed polarization because multiple scattering would effectively depolarize the light and the resulting continuum polarization would also show significant changes with time ( see also @xcite ) . in the optical image of m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pa of @xmath101 seems to align with the direction of the local dust lanes around the sn position , which further strengthens the argument that the polarization is unrelated to the cs matter .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows that the polarization peak appears outside the wavelength range of our observations , i.e. , @xmath102 m .",
    "this @xmath25 is considerably smaller than the typical value determined from the galactic isp . for comparison",
    ", we also plotted the polarization curves determined from the serkowski law with / without the wilking law in figure [ fig : fig3 ] . for the serkowski law , we fitted it with a constant @xmath103 , a typical one for galactic isp @xcite , because the fitted parameters do not converge in case of free @xmath26 .",
    "we can not obtain any good fit with the wilking law .",
    "in general , with the wilking law , a short @xmath25 leads to small @xmath26 ( corresponding to broader peak in @xmath104 curve ) ; however , the observed steep gradient of @xmath104 requires a large @xmath26 value .",
    "the wilking law also fails to describe the continuum polarization measured for sn 2006x @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that @xmath105 and @xmath27 m derived for the sn 1986 g data @xcite do not satisfy the wilking law .",
    "the fact that 5 out of 105 galactic reddened stars show considerable isp with @xmath106 m and the wilking law holds for 4 of the 5 stars within the errors @xcite suggests that the failure of the wilking law to describe the data may be common for highly reddened sne ia and the dust properties of the host galaxies may differ from those of the milkyway .    using only serkowski law",
    ", we note that there is a systematic difference in the polarization of @xmath107@xmath108% between the observed polarization and the fitted curve at longer wavelengths ( @xmath109 m , figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "this difference may be explained by considering an analog of the ` ir polarization excess ' found in the galactic isp at longer wavelengths ( @xmath110 m ) , which is characterized by an inverse power - law , i.e. , @xmath104 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the wavelength dependence of polarization of sn  2014j at @xmath111 m can be well described by @xmath112 with the index of @xmath113 ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the polarization closely follows a power - law dependence even at the optical wavelengths for sn  2014j . for galactic reddened stars ,",
    "the index @xmath114 is typically in a relatively narrow range of 1.52.0 and is uncorrelated with the wavelength dependence of optical polarization , e.g. , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath114 obtained for the isp in m82 appears slightly steeper than that for the galactic isp .",
    "this may be related to the failure of the wilking law , because the polarization peak observed in sn  2014j is clearly sharper than that expected for a galactic isp with a similar @xmath25 ( see figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "as described above , sn  2014j is a highly reddened sn ia , similar to sne 1986 g , 2006x and 2008fp . the blue continuum of these sne ia all exhibit significant polarization , which is atypical of a galactic isp . to a first - order approximation",
    ", a small @xmath25 corresponds to small mean size of the dust grains causing the observed polarization .",
    "this can be explained using mie theory for dielectric cylinders , e.g. , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the effective radius and @xmath117 is refractive index of the cylindrical grain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . assuming @xmath118 m and @xmath119 ( appropriate for silicates ) ,",
    "then @xmath116 of the polarizing grains should be @xmath120 m .",
    "although a small @xmath25 ( and thus a small @xmath116 ) could be the result of a failure of alignment / asphericity only of larger grains , the small @xmath121 inferred for sn  2014j suggests that the effect is not significant and the grain size should be intrinsically small .",
    "it is not known whether the empirical relation @xmath122(@xmath61 m ) determined for the galactic isp @xcite holds in the host galaxies of these highly reddened sne ia ; however , interestingly , it has been shown that @xmath121 is small for these sne , e.g. , @xmath123 for sn 1986 g and @xmath124 for sn 2006x ( table 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the @xmath125 m obtained for sn 1986 g @xcite satisfies the empirical relation within the errors . for sn 2006x , @xmath126 is much smaller than that expected from @xmath127 m ( i.e. , @xmath128 ) .",
    "@xcite derived a slightly larger value of @xmath129 from optical and nir photometry of sn 2006x ; however , this is still smaller than the expected value . it should be noted that @xmath25 is somewhat ambiguous because the observations did not cover the wavelengths shorter than 0.35  @xmath61 m @xcite , which makes it difficult to completely rule out the applicability of the empirical relation . for sn  2014j",
    ", @xmath73 @xcite , which leads to @xmath130 m , which is speculatively consistent with the result of our fit to serkowski law with a constant @xmath131 . therefore , although the wilking law ( i.e. , @xmath25@xmath26 relation ) no longer appears to be valid for extragalactic isps ( see  [ subsec : polari ] ) , the positive correlation of @xmath25@xmath121 may hold even for an isp with @xmath132 m , at least , in part of the extragalactic environment .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the smaller values of @xmath121 seen in some moderately to highly reddened sne ia ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggests that the isp in the host galaxies has a smaller @xmath25 , and hence a smaller @xmath116 .",
    "the failure of the data to follow the wilking law is harder to be explain using grain sizes only ; a qualitative difference in the size distribution ( and possibly in composition , shape , and degree of alignment ) would be required for the dust grains between our galaxy and those host galaxies of sne ia .",
    "a possible explanation for the atypical dust seen in the host galaxies of some sne ia is that the interstellar dust within our galaxy is not in fact typical .",
    "the understanding of physical properties of extragalactic dust grains remains incomplete .",
    "extensive data on the uv and optical polarimetry for sne ia may therefore be crucial for further understanding of the properties of extragalactic dust .",
