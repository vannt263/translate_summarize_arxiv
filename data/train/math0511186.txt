    "@xmath21 means that the site  @xmath19 is unable to find any center willing to accept it , and @xmath22 means that  @xmath19 is unable to decide between two or more different centers ( intuitively , this means that  @xmath19 is exactly on the frontier between the territories of different centers from  @xmath0 ) .",
    "a @xmath8-null set of sites with @xmath22 is allowed for technical reasons .",
    "stability of an allocation is defined in the following way .",
    "let  @xmath18 be a center and let  @xmath19 be a site with @xmath23 .",

    "an allocation is _ stable _ if there are no unstable pairs .",
    "the above definition of stable allocation is not constructive .",
    "a more constructive version can be found in section 2 of  @xcite .",
    "informally , the explicit construction of the stable allocation can be described as follows .",
    "for each center , we start growing a ball centered in it .",
    "all the balls grow simultaneously , at the same linear speed .",
    "each center gets the sites captured by its ball , unless it is sated or the site was already captured by some other center . remembering that one picture is worth a thousand words",
    ", we refer to figure  [ alloc ] .",
    "also , it is worth noting that the territory of a particular center is not necessarily connected ( one can imagine the following situation : a center is surrounded by several other centers , so the territory it gets near itself is not enough , and so it has to wait until the neighbouring centers are sated to look for more territory outside ) .    , and with appetites @xmath28.,width=306 ]    in  @xcite , among other results , it was proved the existence of stable allocation for any set of centers and any @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30-a.s @xmath8-uniqueness of the stable allocation in the both following cases :    * @xmath0 is given by a set of points of an ergodic point process in @xmath1 or * @xmath0 is finite .",
    "also , it was proved that    * if @xmath31 ( subcritical regime ) then a.s .",
    "all centers are sated but there is an infinite volume of unclaimed sites ; * if @xmath32 ( critical regime ) then a.s .",
    "all centers are sated and @xmath8-a.a .",
    "sites are claimed ; * if @xmath33 ( supercritical regime ) then a.s .  not all centers are sated but @xmath8-a.a .",
    "sites are claimed .",
    "denote by @xmath34 the closure of @xmath35 .",
    "the set @xmath34 is the main object of study in this paper ; it will be referred to as the _ set of claimed sites _ ( even though it may contain some @xmath36 with @xmath22 ) .    as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "this model has nice monotonicity properties , both in  @xmath4 and  @xmath0 ( see propositions 21 and 22 of  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we only need some particular cases of what was proven there , namely ,    * if the sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constructed using the same set of centers @xmath0 and different appetites @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , and @xmath41 , then @xmath42 ; * if the sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constructed using the same appetite @xmath4 and different sets of centers @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , and @xmath45 , then @xmath42 .",
    "in this paper we partially solve an open problem suggested in  @xcite concerning the percolation of the claimed sites .",
    "[ perc ] we say that there is a percolation by claimed sites , if there exists an unbounded connected subset of  @xmath34 .      on figure  [ 06e08 ]",

    "* also , if  @xmath4 is small enough and  @xmath2 , then there exists percolation by unclaimed sites ( i.e. , a.s .",
    "there is an unbounded connected component in @xmath51 ) .    since in the model with @xmath52",
    "almost all the sites are claimed , that is , @xmath53 , it is clear that @xmath54 .",
    "the next result implies that if the dimension is sufficiently high , then @xmath55 ( and even that @xmath56 , as @xmath57 ) .",
    "[ t_limsup ] we have @xmath58    simulations suggest that @xmath59 is around @xmath60 ( see figure  [ 07 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that proving that @xmath61 ( as well as @xmath55 for small @xmath62 ) is still an open problem .",
    "since the proof of theorem  [ t_limsup ] is much simpler , let us begin by    _ proof of theorem  [ t_limsup]_. note that if we rescale the space by factor  @xmath63 ( that is , apply a homothetic map @xmath64 ) , then we obtain the model with the intensity of the poisson process being @xmath65 and the appetite  @xmath66 .",
    "the geometric properties of the allocation do not change under this transformation , and the product of intensity and appetite does not change either .",
    "in particular , this shows that the percolation properties of the model only depend on the product  @xmath67 .",
    "let  @xmath68 be volume of the unit ball in  @xmath1 .",
    "since the volume of the ball of radius @xmath69 is  @xmath4 , any site which is at most @xmath69 far away from some center will belong to  @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , the centers want territory of volume  @xmath4 as close as possible , so , for any center , any site  @xmath19 in the ball of volume  @xmath4 centered there will be claimed , either by this center , or by another one ( or it may happen that @xmath22 so that  @xmath19 is disputed by two or more centers , but in this case @xmath70 anyway ) .",
    "so , the set of claimed sites  @xmath34 dominates the poisson boolean model with rate @xmath11 and radius @xmath69 . by the above rescaling argument , that model is equivalent to the poisson boolean model with @xmath71 and radius  @xmath72 .",
    "let  @xmath73 be the critical rate for the percolation in the poisson boolean model with radius  @xmath72 .",
    "now it is straightforward to obtain that theorem  [ t_limsup ] is a consequence of the following result of  @xcite : @xmath74    to prove theorem  [ t_main ] , we need some preparations .",
    "let us from now on fix  @xmath52 and vary  @xmath10 , instead of fixing @xmath11 and varying @xmath4 ( the rescaling argument in the beginning of the proof of theorem  [ t_limsup ] allows us to do this ) .",
    "the idea of the proof of the part  ( i ) of theorem  [ t_main ] can be described as follows :    1 .",
    "we define a `` discrete '' ( i.e. , made of cubes of size 1 ) dependent percolation model , and prove ( lemma  [ l_terr_cub ] ) that it dominates the original model , so that it is enough to prove the absence of percolation in this discrete model .",
    "the important properties of the discrete model are provided by  ( [ oc_r1 ] ) and lemma  [ l_indep ] .",
    "then , in definition  [ df_passable ] , we define the notion of _ passable _",
    "level-@xmath75 cube ( a level-@xmath75 cube is a cube of size  @xmath75 , see  ( [ level - m_cube ] ) below ) , and we show ( lemma  [ l_ind_passable ] ) that the cubes are passable or not independently if they are far enough from each other .",
    "4 .   using that independence , we prove ( lemmas  [ l_an ] and  [ l_a_n_pass ] ) that the probability that a bigger cube is passable can be bounded from above in terms of the probability that a smaller cube is passable . 5 .",
    "this allows us to prove that , for small enough  @xmath10 , the probability that a cube is passable tends to 0 as the size of the cube goes to infinity . with a little more work ,",
    "this implies the absence of percolation .    for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ,",
    "define the _",
    "level_-@xmath75 cube @xmath78 associated with @xmath79 by @xmath80 note that , in the above definition , the quantity  @xmath75 is not necessarily integer ( although it is convenient to think about it as such ) .",
    "note also that the union of all level-@xmath75 cubes is @xmath1 , and the intersection of any two distinct level-@xmath75 cubes is either empty , or has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "we say that two cubes are connected if they have at least one point in common .",
    "denote by  @xmath81 the number of centers in  @xmath82 , i.e. , the cardinality of the set @xmath83 . at this point",
    "we need to introduce more notations .",
    "first , we define the distance between two sets @xmath84 in a usual way : @xmath85 then , for any @xmath86 , we define a discrete ball @xmath87 by @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath91 for the smallest integer greater than or equal to  @xmath19 and  @xmath92 for the integer part of  @xmath19 . for each @xmath93 , define also the random variable ( note that @xmath94 ) @xmath95 ( here we use the convention @xmath96 ) , where , as before , @xmath68 is the volume of the ball with radius  @xmath97 in  @xmath1 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , if @xmath81=0 .",
    "we have the following    [ l_terr_cub ] the territories from all centers in @xmath82 are contained in @xmath100 .",
    "_ proof of lemma  [ l_terr_cub]_. let us first show that @xmath101 indeed , since @xmath102 and the level-@xmath97 cubes have side @xmath97 and thus diameter  @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 for @xmath105 , using  ( [ dist_betad ] ) and the fact that @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107 finally , note that if @xmath108 , then there is at least one center in @xmath109 , and thus @xmath110 , so @xmath111 .",
    "so , from  ( [ dist_betad ] ) and  ( [ noch_einmal ] ) , we get that if @xmath112 ( by  ( [ def_beta_d ] ) , this is indeed the case ) , then  ( [ stab2.1 ] ) holds . now , suppose that there exist @xmath113 and @xmath36 such that @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "one can choose a small enough  @xmath116 such that @xmath117 and any site  @xmath118 with @xmath119 belongs to  @xmath100 ( this is possible since @xmath100 is a compact set , and for any  @xmath120 from the boundary of @xmath100 it holds that @xmath121 , otherwise the next level-1 cube would be included in  @xmath100 too ) .",
    "there exists  @xmath122 such that @xmath123 ( and so @xmath124 ) and    * either @xmath125 for some @xmath126 , * or  @xmath122 is unclaimed .",
    "this is because , by  ( [ def_ri ] ) , the number of centers in @xmath109 is at most @xmath127 , and each one of them wants to claim a territory of volume  1 , but @xmath128 .",
    "now , let us show that @xmath129 is an unstable pair . indeed ,    * @xmath122 desires  @xmath18 , because , by  ( [ stab2.1 ] ) , we have @xmath130 , and * @xmath18 covets  @xmath122 , because @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the centers from @xmath82 will be sated with territory inside @xmath100 and lemma  [ l_terr_cub ] is proved .",
    "lemma  [ l_terr_cub ] allows us to majorize the original model by the following ( dependent ) percolation model : given the set @xmath0 of points of poisson process , for every @xmath82 we paint all the level-@xmath97 cubes in @xmath100 and denote by @xmath132 the set of painted sites .",
    "that is , we define @xmath133    at this point it is important to observe that , by lemma  [ l_terr_cub ] , it holds that @xmath134 .",
    "thus , to prove the first part of theorem  [ t_main ] , it is sufficient to prove the absence of the infinite cluster in @xmath132 for small @xmath10 .",
