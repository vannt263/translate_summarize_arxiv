    "the evaluation of the total causal effect of a given point exposure , treatment or intervention on an outcome of interest is arguably the most common objective of experimental and observational studies in the fields of epidemiology , biostatistics and in the social sciences .",
    "however , in recent years , investigators in these various fields have become increasingly interested in making inferences about the direct or indirect pathways of the exposure effect , through a mediator variable or not , that occurs subsequently to the exposure and prior to the outcome .",
    "recently , the counterfactual language of causal inference has proven particularly useful for formalizing mediation analysis . indeed , causal inference offers a formal mathematical framework for defining varieties of direct and indirect effects , and for establishing necessary and sufficient identifying conditions of these effects .",
    "a notable contribution of causal inference to the literature on mediation analysis is the key distinction drawn between so - called controlled direct effects versus natural direct effects . in words",
    ", the controlled direct effect refers to the exposure effect that arises upon intervening to set the mediator to a fixed level that may differ from its actual observed value [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "in contrast , the natural ( also known as pure ) direct effect captures the effect of the exposure when one intervenes to set the mediator to the ( random ) level it would have been in the absence of exposure [ @xcite , @xcite ] . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "controlled direct and indirect effects are particularly relevant for policy making , whereas natural direct and indirect effects are more useful for understanding the underlying mechanism by which the exposure operates .",
    "in fact , natural direct and indirect effects combine to produce the exposure total effect .    to formally define natural direct and indirect effects",
    "first requires defining counterfactuals .",
    "we assume that for each level of a binary exposure @xmath0 , and of a mediator variable @xmath1 , there exist a counterfactual variable @xmath2 corresponding to the outcome @xmath3 had possibly contrary to fact the exposure and mediator variables taken the value @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath5 , we assume there exists a counterfactual variable @xmath6 corresponding to the mediator variable had possibly contrary to fact the exposure variable taken the value @xmath7 .",
    "the current paper concerns the decomposition of the total effect of @xmath0 on @xmath3 , in terms of natural direct and natural indirect effects , which , expressed on the mean difference scale , is given by@xmath8\\\\[-8pt ] \\qquad&=&\\overbrace{\\mathbb{e } ( y_{e=1,m_{e=1}}-y_{e=1,m_{e=0 } } ) } ^{\\mathrm{natural\\ indirect\\ effect}}+ \\overbrace{\\mathbb{e } ( y_{e=1,m_{e=0}}-y_{e=0,m_{e=0 } } ) } % ^{\\mathrm{natural\\ direct\\ effect } } , \\nonumber\\hspace*{-25pt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 stands for expectation .    in an effort to account for confounding bias when estimating causal effects , such as the average total effect ( [ total_effect ] ) from nonexperimental data , investigators routinely collect and adjust for in data analysis , a large number of confounding factors . because of the curse of dimensionality , nonparametric methods of estimation are typically not practical in such settings , and one usually resorts to one of two dimension - reduction strategies ; either one relies on a model for the outcome given exposure and counfounders , or alternately one relies on a model for the exposure , that is , the propensity score .",
    "recently , powerful semiparametric methods have been developed to analyze observational studies that produce so - called double robust and highly efficient estimates of the exposure total causal effect [ robins ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] and similar methods have also been developed to estimate controlled direct effects [ @xcite ] .",
    "an important advantage of a double robust method is that it carefully combines both of the aforementioned dimension reduction strategies for confounding adjustment , to produce an estimator of the causal effect that remains consistent and asymptotically normal , provided at least one of the two strategies is correct , without necessarily knowing which strategy is indeed correct [ @xcite ] .",
    "unfortunately , similar methods for making semiparametric inferences about marginal natural direct and indirect effects are currently lacking .",
    "thus , this paper develops a general semiparametric framework for obtaining inferences about marginal natural direct and indirect effects on the mean of an outcome , while appropriately accounting for a large number of confounding factors for the exposure and the mediator variables .",
    "our semiparametric framework is particularly appealing , as it gives new insight on issues of efficiency and robustness in the context of mediation analysis .",
    "specifically , in section  [ sec2 ] , we adopt the sequential ignorability assumption of imai , keele and tingley ( @xcite ) under which , in conjunction with the standard consistency and positivity assumptions , we derive the efficient influence function and thus obtain the semiparametric efficiency bound for the natural direct and natural indirect marginal mean causal effects , in the nonparametric model @xmath10 in which the observed data likelihood is left unrestricted .",
    "we further show that in order to conduct mediation inferences in @xmath10 , one must estimate at least a subset of the following quantities :    the conditional expectation of the outcome given the mediator , exposure and confounding factors ;    the density of the mediator given the exposure and the confounders ;    the density of the exposure given the confounders .    ideally , to minimize the possibility of modeling bias",
    ", one may wish to estimate each of these quantities nonparametrically ; however , as previously argued , when as we assume throughout , we wish to account for numerous confounders , such nonparametric estimates will likely perform poorly in finite samples .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec2.3 ] we develop an alternative multiply robust strategy . to do so , we propose to model ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) parametrically ( or semiparametrically ) , but rather than obtaining mediation inferences that rely on the correct specification of a specific subset of these models , instead we carefully combine these three models to produce estimators of the marginal mean direct and indirect effects that remain consistent and asymptotically normal ( can ) in a union model , where at least one but not necessarily all of the following conditions hold :    the parametric or semi - parametric models for the conditional expectation of the outcome ( i ) and for the conditional density of the mediator ( ii ) are correctly specified ;    the parametric or semiparametric models for the conditional expectation of the outcome ( i ) and for the conditional density of the exposure ( iii ) are correctly specified ;    the parametric or semiparametric models for the conditional densities of the exposure and the mediator ( ii ) and ( iii ) are correctly specified .",
    "accordingly , we define submodels @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 of @xmath10 corresponding to models ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "thus , the proposed approach is triply robust as it produces valid inferences about natural direct and indirect effects in the union model @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , as we later show in section  [ sec2.3 ] , the proposed estimators are also locally semiparametric efficient in the sense that they achieve the respective efficiency bounds for estimating the natural direct and indirect effects in @xmath15 , at the intersection submodel @xmath16 .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] summarizes a simulation study illustrating the finite sample performance of the various estimators described in section  [ sec2 ] , and section  [ sec4 ] gives a real data application of these methods .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] describes a strategy to improve the stability of the proposed multiply robust estimator which directly depends on inverse exposure and mediator density weights , when such weights are highly variable , and section  [ sec6 ] demonstrates the favorable performance of two modified multiply robust estimators in the context of such highly variable weights . in section  [ sec7 ] , we compare the proposed methodology to the prevailing estimators in the literature . based on this comparison , we conclude that the new approach should generally be preferred because an inference under the proposed method is guaranteed to remain valid under many more data generating laws than an inference based on each of the other existing approaches .",
    "in particular , as we argue below the approach of @xcite is not entirely satisfactory because , despite producing a can estimator of the marginal direct effect under the union model @xmath17 ( and therefore an estimator that is double robust ) , their estimator requires a correct model for the density of the mediator .",
    "thus , unlike the direct effect estimator developed in this paper , the van der laan estimator fails to be consistent under the submodel @xmath18 .",
    "nonetheless , the estimator of van der laan is in fact locally efficient in model @xmath17 , provided the model for the mediator s conditional density is either known , or can be efficiently estimated . this property is confirmed in a supplementary online appendix [ @xcite ] , where we also provide a general map that relates the efficient influence function for model @xmath19 to the corresponding efficient influence function for model @xmath20 , assuming an arbitrary parametric or semiparametric model for the mediator conditional density is correctly specified . in section  [ sec8 ] , we describe a novel double robust sensitivity analysis framework to assess the impact on inferences about the natural direct effect , of a departure from the ignorability assumption of the mediator variable .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "suppose i.i.d .",
    "data on @xmath21 is collected for @xmath22 subjects . recall that @xmath3 is an outcome of interest , @xmath0 is a binary exposure variable , @xmath1 is a mediator variable with support @xmath23 , known to occur subsequently to @xmath0 and prior to @xmath3 and @xmath24 is a vector of pre - exposure variables with support @xmath25 that confound the association between @xmath26 and @xmath3 .",
    "the overarching goal of this paper is to provide some theory of inference about the fundamental functional of mediation analysis which judea pearl calls `` the mediation causal formula '' [ pearl ( @xcite ) ] and which , expressed on the mean scale , is @xmath27\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\hspace*{19pt}{}\\times f_{m|e , x } ( m|e=0,x = x ) f_{x}(x)\\,d\\mu(m , x),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the conditional density of the mediator @xmath1 given @xmath30 and the density of @xmath24 , and @xmath31 is a dominating measure for the distribution of @xmath32 .",
    "hereafter , to keep with standard statistical parlance , we shall simply refer to @xmath33 as the `` mediation functional '' or `` m - functional '' since it is formally a functional on the nonparametric statistical model @xmath34 of all regular laws @xmath35 of the observed data @xmath36 that satisfy the positivity assumption given below ; that is , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the real line .",
    "the functional @xmath33 is of keen interest here because it arises in the estimation of natural direct and indirect effects as we describe next .",
    "to do so , we make the consistency assumption .",
    "_ consistency : _",
    "@xmath39    in addition , we adopt the sequential ignorability assumption of imai , keele and tingley ( @xcite ) which states that for @xmath40 .",
    "_ _ sequential ignorability:__@xmath41 where @xmath42 states that @xmath43 is independent of @xmath44 given @xmath45 ; paired with the following :    _ positivity : _",
    "@xmath46    then , under the consistency , sequential ignorability and positivity assumptions , imai , keele and tingley ( @xcite ) showed that @xmath47 so that @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , are identified from the observed data , and so is the mean natural direct effect @xmath51 and the mean natural indirect effect @xmath52 . for binary @xmath3",
    ", one might alternatively consider the natural direct effect on the risk ratio scale @xmath53 or on the odds ratio scale @xmath54 and similarly defined natural indirect effects on the risk ratio and odds ratio scales .",
    "it is instructive to contrast the expression ( [ main_functional ] ) for @xmath55 with the expression ( [ ate functional ] ) for @xmath56 corresponding to @xmath57 , and to note that the two expressions bare a striking resemblance except the density of the mediator in the first expression conditions on the unexposed ( with @xmath58 ) , whereas in the second expression , the mediator density is conditional on the exposed ( with ) .",
    "as we demonstrate below , this subtle difference has remarkable implications for inference .",
    "@xcite was the first to derive the m - functional @xmath59 under a different set of assumptions .",
    "others have since contributed alternative sets of identifying assumptions . in this paper , we have chosen to work under the sequential ignorability assumption of @xcite , @xcite , but note that alternative related assumptions exist in the literature [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hafeman and vanderweele ( @xcite ) ] ; however , we note that @xcite disagree with the label `` sequential ignorability '' because its terminology has previously carried a  different interpretation in the literature .",
    "nonetheless , the assumption entails two ignorability - like assumptions that are made sequentially .",
    "first , given the observed pre - exposure confounders , the exposure assignment is assumed to be ignorable , that is , statistically independent of potential outcomes and potential mediators .",
    "the second part of the assumption states that the mediator is ignorable given the observed exposure and pre - exposure confounders .",
    "specifically , the second part of the sequential ignorability assumption is conditional on the observed value of the ignorable treatment and the observed pretreatment confounders .",
    "we note that the second part of the sequential ignorability assumption is particularly strong and must be made with care .",
    "this is partly because it is always possible that there might be unobserved variables that confound the relationship between the outcome and the mediator variables , even upon conditioning on the observed exposure and covariates .",
    "furthermore , the confounders @xmath24 must all be pre - exposure variables ; that is , they must precede @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , @xcite proved that without additional assumptions , one can not identify natural direct and indirect effects if there are confounding variables that are affected by the exposure , even if such variables are observed by the investigator [ also see tchetgen tchetgen and vanderweele ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "this implies that , similarly to the ignorability of the exposure in observational studies , ignorability of the mediator can not be established with certainty , even after collecting as many pre - exposure confounders as possible .",
    "furthermore , as @xcite point out , whereas the first part of the sequential ignorability assumption could , in principle , be enforced in a  randomized study , by randomizing @xmath0 within levels of @xmath60 the second part of the sequential ignorability assumption can not similarly be enforced experimentally , even by randomization . and",
    "thus , for this latter assumption to hold , one must entirely rely on expert knowledge about the mechanism under study .",
    "for this reason , it will be crucial in practice to supplement mediation analyses with a sensitivity analysis that accurately quantifies the degree to which results are robust to a potential violation of the sequential ignorability assumption .",
    "later in the paper , we develop a variety of sensitivity analysis techniques that allow the analyst to quantify the degree to which his or her mediation analysis results are robust to a potential violation of the sequential ignorability assumption .      in this section ,",
    "we derive the efficient influence function for the m - functional @xmath33 in @xmath10 .",
    "this result is then combined with the efficient influence function for the functional @xmath61 [ @xcite , @xcite ] to obtain the efficient influence function for the natural direct and indirect effects on the mean difference scale .",
    "thus , in the following , we shall use the efficient influence function @xmath62 of @xmath63 which is well known to be @xmath64 where for @xmath65 , we define @xmath66 so that @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the following theorem is proved in the .",
    "[ teo1 ] under the consistency , sequential ignorability and positivity assumptions , the efficient influence function of the m - functional @xmath33 in model @xmath10 is given by @xmath69 and the efficient influence function of the natural direct and indirect effects on the mean difference scale in model @xmath70 are respectively given by @xmath71 and @xmath72 thus , the semiparametric efficiency bound for estimating the natural direct and the natural indirect effects in @xmath73 are respectively given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "although not presented here , theorem  [ teo1 ] is easily extended to obtain the efficient influence functions and the respective semiparametric efficiency bounds for the direct and indirect effects on the risk ratio and the odds ratio scales by a straightforward application of the delta method .",
    "an important implication of the theorem is that all regular and asymptotically linear ( ral ) estimators of @xmath33 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 in model @xmath10 share the common influence functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "specifically , any ral estimator @xmath80 of the m - functional @xmath33 in model @xmath10 , shares a common asymptotic expansion , @xmath81 where @xmath82 = n^{-1}\\sum_{i } [ \\cdot ] _ { i}$ ] . to illustrate this property of nonparametric ral estimators , and as a motivation to multiply robust estimation when nonparametric methods are not appropriate , we provide a detailed study of three nonparametric strategies for estimating the m - functional in a simple yet instructive setting in which @xmath24 and @xmath1 are both discrete with finite support .",
    "_ strategy _ 1 : the first strategy entails obtaining the maximum likelihood estimator upon evaluating the m - functional under the empirical law of the observed data , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the empirical probability mass functions , and @xmath86 is the expectation of @xmath3 under @xmath84 .",
    "_ strategy _ 2 : the second strategy is based on the following alternative representation of the m - functional : @xmath87    thus , our second estimator takes the form @xmath88 with @xmath89 the empirical estimate of the probability mass function @xmath90 .",
    "_ strategy _ 3 : the last strategy is based on a third representation of the m - functional @xmath91    thus , our third estimator takes the form @xmath92 at first glance the three estimators @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 might appear to be distinct ; however , we observe that provided the empirical distribution function @xmath96 satisfies the positivity assumption , and thus @xmath97 , then actually @xmath98 since the three representations agree on the nonparametric model @xmath99 .",
    "therefore we may conclude that these three estimators are in fact asymptotically efficient in @xmath10 with common influence function @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , from this observation , one further concludes that ( asymptotic ) inferences obtained using one of the three representations are identical to inferences using either of the other two representations .    at this juncture",
    ", we note that the above equivalence no longer applies when as we have previously argued will likely occur in practice , @xmath32 contains 3 or more continuous variables and/or @xmath24 is too high dimensional for models to be saturated or nonparametric , and thus parametric ( or semiparametric ) models are specified for dimension reduction .",
    "specifically , for such settings , we observe that three distinct modeling strategies are available . under the first strategy ,",
    "the estimator @xmath101 is obtained @xmath95 using parametric model estimates @xmath102 and @xmath103 instead of their nonparametric counterparts ; similarly under the second strategy , the estimator @xmath104 is obtained similarly to @xmath94 using estimates of parametric models @xmath105 and @xmath106 and finally , under the third strategy , @xmath107 is obtained similarly to @xmath93 using @xmath106 and @xmath108 .",
    "then , it follows that @xmath109 is can under the submodel @xmath11 , but is generally inconsistent if either @xmath110 or @xmath111 fails to be consistent .",
    "similarly , @xmath104 and @xmath112 are , respectively , can under the submodels @xmath113 and @xmath114 , but each estimator generally fails to be consistent outside of the corresponding submodel . in the next section , we propose an approach that produces a triply robust estimator by combining the above three strategies so that only one of models @xmath115 and @xmath114 needs to be valid for consistency of the estimator .",

    "in this section , we briefly compare the proposed approach to some existing estimators in the literature .",
    "perhaps the most common approach for estimating direct and indirect effects when @xmath3 is continuous uses a system of linear structural equations ; whereby , a linear structural equation for the outcome , given the exposure , the mediator and the confounders , is combined with a linear structural equation for the mediator , given the exposure and confounders , to produce an estimator of natural direct and indirect effects .",
    "the classical approach of @xcite is a particular instance of this approach . in recent work , mainly motivated by pearl s mediation functional , several authors [ imai , keele and tingley ( @xcite ) , imai , keele and yamamoto ( @xcite ) , pearl",
    "( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite ] have demonstrated how the simple linear structural equation approach generalizes to accommodate both , the presence of an interaction between exposure and mediator variables , and a nonlinear link function , either in the regression model for the outcome , or in the regression model for the mediator , or both .",
    "in fact , when the effect of confounders is also modeled in such structural equations , inferences based on the latter can be viewed as special instances of inferences obtained under a particular specification of model @xmath11 for the outcome and the mediator densities . and",
    "thus , as previously shown in the simulations , an estimator obtained under a system of structural equations will generally fail to produce a consistent estimator of natural direct and indirect effects when model @xmath11 is incorrect , whereas , by using the proposed multiply robust estimator , valid inferences can be recovered under the union model @xmath282 , even if @xmath283 fails .",
    "a notable improvement on the system of structural equations approach is the double robust estimator of a natural direct effect due to @xcite .",
    "their estimator solves the estimating equation constructed using an empirical version of @xmath284 given in the online appendix .",
    "they show their estimator remains can in the larger submodel @xmath17 and therefore , they can recover valid inferences even when the outcome model is incorrect , provided both the exposure and mediator models are correct .",
    "unfortunately , the van der laan estimator is still not entirely satisfactory because unlike the proposed multiply robust estimator , it requires that the model for the mediator density is correct . nonetheless ,",
    "if the mediator model is correct , the authors establish that their estimator achieves the efficiency bound for model @xmath17 at the intersection submodel @xmath285 where all models are correct ; and thus it is locally semiparametric efficient in @xmath286 .",
    "interestingly , as we report in the online supplement , the semiparametric efficiency bounds for models @xmath287 and @xmath288 are distinct , because the density of the mediator variable is not ancillary for inferences about the m - functional .",
    "thus , any restriction placed on the mediator s conditional density can , when correct , produce improvements in efficiency .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the role played by the density of the exposure variable , which as in the estimation of the marginal causal effect , remains ancillary for inferences about the m - functional and thus the efficiency bound for the latter is unaltered by any additional information on the former [ @xcite ] . in the online appendix",
    ", we provide a general functional map that relates the efficient influence function for the larger model @xmath288 to the efficient influence for the smaller model @xmath287 where the model for the mediator is either parametric or semiparametric .",
    "our map is instructive because it makes explicit using simple geometric arguments , the information that is gained from increasing restrictions on the law of the mediator . in the online appendix",
    ", we illustrate the map by recovering the efficient influence function of van der laan and petersen in the case of a singleton model ( i.e. , a  known conditional density ) for the mediator and in the case of a parametric model for the mediator .",
    "we describe a semiparametric sensitivity analysis framework to assess the extent to which a violation of the ignorability assumption for the mediator might alter inferences about natural direct and indirect effects .",

    "this is a daunting task which renders the approach generally impractical , except perhaps in the simple setting where it is reasonable to postulate a single binary confounder is unobserved , and one is willing to make further simplifying assumptions about the required sensitivity parameters [ @xcite ] . in comparison",

    "<S> while estimation of the marginal ( total ) causal effect of a point exposure on an outcome is arguably the most common objective of experimental and observational studies in the health and social sciences , in recent years , investigators have also become increasingly interested in mediation analysis . specifically , upon evaluating the total effect of the exposure </S>",
    "<S> , investigators routinely wish to make inferences about the direct or indirect pathways of the effect of the exposure , through a mediator variable or not , that occurs subsequently to the exposure and prior to the outcome . </S>",
    "<S> although powerful semiparametric methodologies have been developed to analyze observational studies that produce double robust and highly efficient estimates of the marginal total causal effect , similar methods for mediation analysis are currently lacking . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this paper develops a  general semiparametric framework for obtaining inferences about so - called marginal natural direct and indirect causal effects , while appropriately accounting for a large number of pre - exposure confounding factors for the exposure and the mediator variables . </S>",
    "<S> our analytic framework is particularly appealing , because it gives new insights on issues of efficiency and robustness in the context of mediation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we propose new multiply robust locally efficient estimators of the marginal natural indirect and direct causal effects , and develop a  novel double robust sensitivity analysis framework for the assumption of ignorability of the mediator variable .    .    </S>"
