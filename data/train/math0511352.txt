    "the theory of uniformly hyperbolic dynamics was initiated in the 1960 s by smale  @xcite and , through the work of his students and collaborators , as well as mathematicians in the russian school , immediately led to extraordinary development of the whole field of dynamical systems . however , despite its great successes , this theory left out important classes of dynamical systems , which do not conform with the basic assumptions of uniform hyperbolicity .",
    "the most influential examples of such systems are , arguably , the hnon map  @xcite , for the discrete time case , and the lorenz flow  @xcite , for the continuous time case .",
    "the lorenz equations highlighted , in a striking way , the fact that for continuous time systems , robust dynamics may occur outside the realm of uniform hyperbolicity and , indeed , in the presence of equilibria that are accumulated by recurrent periodic orbits .",
    "this prompted the quest for an extension of the notion of uniform hyperbolicity encompassing all continuous time systems with robust dynamical behavior .",
    "a fundamental step was carried out by morales , pacifico , pujals  @xcite , who proved that a robust invariant attractor of a @xmath0-dimensional flow that contains some equilibrium must be _ singular hyperbolic _ , that is , it must admit an invariant splitting @xmath2 of the tangent bundle into a @xmath3-dimensional uniformly contracting sub - bundle and a @xmath4-dimensional volume - expanding sub - bundle .",
    "in fact , morales , pacifico , pujals proved that any robust invariant _ set _ of a @xmath0-dimensional flow containing some equilibrium is a singular hyperbolic attractor or repeller . in the absence of equilibria",
    ", robustness implies uniform hyperbolicity .",
    "the first examples of singular hyperbolic sets included the lorenz attractor @xcite and its geometric models @xcite , and the singular - horseshoe @xcite , besides the uniformly hyperbolic sets themselves .",
    "many other examples have been found recently , including attractors arising from certain resonant double homoclinic loops @xcite or from certain singular cycles @xcite , and certain models across the boundary of uniform hyperbolicity @xcite .    the next natural step is to try and understand what are the dynamical consequences of singular hyperbolicity .",
    "indeed , it is now classical that uniform hyperbolicity has very precise implications on the dynamics ( symbolic dynamics , entropy ) , the geometry ( invariant foliations , fractal dimensions ) , the statistics ( physical measures , equilibrium states ) of the invariant set .",
    "it is important to know to what extent this remains valid in the singular hyperbolic domain .",
    "there is substantial advance in this direction at the topological level @xcite , but the ergodic theory of singular hyperbolic systems remains mostly open ( for a recent advance in the particular case of the lorenz attractor see  @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is a contribution to such a theory .",
    "firstly , we prove that the flow on a singular hyperbolic set is _",
    "expansive_. roughly speaking , this means that any two orbits that remain close at all times must actually coincide .",
    "however , the precise formulation of this property is far from obvious in this setting of continuous time systems is far from obvious .",
    "the definition we use here was introduced by komuro  @xcite : other , more naive versions , turn out to be inadequate in this context .",
    "another main result , extending @xcite , is that typical orbits in the basin of the attractor have well - defined statistical behavior : for lebesgue almost every point the forward birkhoff time average converges , and is given by a certain physical probability measure .",
    "we also show that this measure admits absolutely continuous conditional measures along the center - unstable directions on the attractor . as a consequence ,",
    "it is a @xmath1-gibbs stateand an equilibrium state for the flow .",
    "the main technical tool for the proof of these results is a construction of convenient cross - sections and invariant contracting foliations for a corresponding poincar map , reminiscent of @xcite , that allow us to reduce the flow dynamics to certain @xmath3-dimensional expanding transformations .",
    "this construction will , no doubt , be useful in further analysis of the dynamics of singular hyperbolic flows .",
