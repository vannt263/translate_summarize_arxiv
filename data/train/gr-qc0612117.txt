    "coalescing binary black holes ( bbhs ) are strong sources of gravitational radiation for ground - based detectors such as ligo , virgo , and geo600 , and for the space - based lisa .",
    "this coalescence is generally considered to proceed in three phases : inspiral , merger , and ringdown @xcite . during the inspiral stage ,",
    "the black holes are well separated and spiral together on quasicircular orbits .",
    "this is followed by the merger stage , during which the black holes plunge towards the center and merge together , forming a common horizon .",
    "this distorted remnant then ` rings down ' to form a kerr black hole by shedding its nonaxisymmetric modes as gravitational radiation .",
    "different techniques are used to calculate the gravitational radiation from these stages .",
    "the inspiral can be treated analytically with post - newtonian ( pn ) techniques ; the gravitational waveform is a chirp , a sinusoid that increases in both amplitude and frequency .",
    "the later part of the ringdown can be handled analytically using black hole perturbation theory , with the resulting waveforms being exponentially damped sinusoids of constant frequency .",
    "however , calculating the waveforms from the dynamical merger , which produces the highest luminosity signal , requires numerical relativity simulations of the full einstein equations in three spatial dimensions plus time . with the first generation of ground - based detectors now taking data and lisa moving forward , knowledge of the merger waveforms and",
    "their impact on detectability and parameter estimation is urgent .",
    "recently there has been dramatic progress in numerical relativity calculations of bbh mergers .",
    "the first full orbit of an equal mass nonspinning bbh was achieved nearly three years ago @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , using a conformal formalism and comoving coordinates , with the black holes represented as punctures @xcite , and held fixed in the grid .",
    "this was followed about a year and a half later by the first simulation of the final orbit , merger , and ringdown @xcite ; this work was carried out using generalized harmonic coordinates with excised black holes moving through the computational domain @xcite .",
    "roughly six months later the moving puncture method , which is based on a conformal formalism and allows the puncture black holes to move across the grid without the need for excision @xcite , was introduced .",
    "this simple yet powerful technique proved to be highly effective @xcite , allowing the evolution of black holes through multiple orbits , merger , and ringdown @xcite .",
    "simulations with unequal masses @xcite and with spins @xcite quickly followed .",
    "longer simulations with several orbits before merger have also been carried out using excision and harmonic techniques @xcite , allowing comparisons between the resulting waveforms @xcite .",
    "this explosion of new work on bbh mergers has opened up exciting opportunities for applications of these results . a number of key applications center on gravitational wave data analysis .",
    "in particular , the need for accurate templates for the full gravitational wave signal  encompassing the inspiral , merger , and ringdown phases  means it is essential to understand the relationship between pn waveforms and the results from numerical relativity @xcite . and , with longer simulations now becoming available , it is becoming feasible to apply these waveforms to questions about the detectability of bbhs for various detectors @xcite . in this paper , we focus especially on issues of accuracy in long simulations , starting in the late - inspiral regime , and their applications in gravitational wave data analysis .",
    "the most rapid advances cover the previously least understood portion of the radiation , the final few cycles of radiation generated from near the `` innermost stable circular orbit '' ( isco ) and afterward , which we call the `` merger - ringdown '' .",
    "already there has been considerable progress toward a full understanding of this important portion of the waveform through which the frequency sweeps by a factor of @xmath10 up to ringdown .",
    "a significant development in this regard was the demonstration of initial - data - independence of merger waveforms for equal - mass , spinless black holes @xcite .",
    "today , there is general agreement that the merger of such a system produces a final kerr bh remnant with spin @xmath11 , and that the amount of energy radiated in the form of gravitational waves , starting with the final few orbits and proceeding through the plunge , merger and ringdown , is @xmath12 @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "there is also consensus on the overall simple shape of the waveforms ; detailed comparison of results among numerical relativity groups has already begun @xcite , with more to follow .",
    "the exploration of parameter space , including various mass ratios @xcite and spins @xcite , is now underway .",
    "future efforts will involve pushing this frontier to increasingly complex mass - ratio and spin - orientation combinations , and to establishing initial - data independence across these parameters .    though more challenging , it is now becoming practical to simulate bbhs starting in the late inspiral as well .",
    "we report on new simulations covering roughly an additional factor of 3 in frequency before the `` merger - ringdown '' .",
    "we have simulated the coalescence of equal - mass , nonspinning black holes , starting in the late - inspiral regime , and continuing through the merger and ringdown .",
    "the black holes start on orbits with very low eccentricity and spiral together through @xmath1 orbits before merging .",
    "the resulting gravitational waveform has @xmath13 cycles , enabling a robust consistency test with late inspiral pn waveforms as reported in @xcite . in sec .",

    "[ sec : simanalysis ] , where we discuss our methodology and the accuracy of our simulations , as well as introduce the important notion of considering physical quantities as functions of frequency rather than time when comparing predictions from different computations .",
    "the rapid advances in understanding merger - ringdown waveforms with emerging simulation results for the late inspiral create a new context for considering gravitational wave observations of this part of the signal from such a system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : applic ] we revisit an analysis of merger detectability originally carried out in flanagan and hughes @xcite , now in the context of presentday and emerging waveform modeling capabilities . in particular , we examine the relative contributions to the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the merger - ringdown and late - inspiral portions of equal - mass coalescence signals , as observed by initial ligo ( iligo ) , advanced ligo ( adligo ) , or lisa .",
    "we also plot contours of snr as functions of redshift @xmath3 and total mass for adligo and lisa , showing their ability to detect bbhs in the cosmos .",

    "late - inspiral evolutions , covering more than a few orbits prior to ringdown , are more challenging than shorter merger - ringdown simulations . in this regime",
    "there is a stronger requirement for numerical stability and a greater demand for computational resources .",
    "in addition , better accuracy is required to control the accumulated phase error , which in turn constrains the numerical error that can be tolerated in the rate of energy loss .    using the moving puncture technique @xcite , with the gauge evolution given by eq.(17 ) and",

    "we used fourth - order - accurate finite differencing techniques with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) to resolve the dynamics near the black holes and in the wave propagation region .",

    "for comparison , we show two other waveforms from earlier simulations carried out by this group ; both were extracted at @xmath20 and have been shifted in time and initial phase so ( as in @xcite ) that the moment of peak @xmath22 radiation amplitude occurs at @xmath21 . as these different simulations may radiate different fractions of the initial mass , we choose the mass @xmath23 of the _ post - merger _",

    "astrophysically , bbhs in this relatively late stage of their evolution are expected to be traveling on nearly circular orbits , as any initial eccentricity would have been radiated away early in their evolution . in this new model , we start the black holes on nearly circular orbits with very small eccentricity @xmath31 , as defined below .",

    "for initial data we used brandt - brgmann puncture data@xcite , generated by a second - order - accurate multigrid solver , amrmg@xcite .",
    "the puncture parameters were determined by the tichy - brgmann prescription for quasicircular initial data@xcite , adjusted slightly , as informed by previous empirical experience , to reduce eccentricity .",
    "our adjustment was simply to reduce the initial coordinate separation by roughly @xmath33 while increasing the initial momentum of each puncture such that the product of the initial momentum with the initial coordinate separation remains constant .",
    "the success of this approach in giving a circular inspiral is roughly indicated by the puncture track ( dotted line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : track ] and the curves in fig .",

    "the dissipation terms , however , were tapered with gaussian functions so as to vanish at each puncture position ; this modification proved necessary for accuracy .",

    "amr was implemented via the software package paramesh @xcite , and interpolation between refinement regions was fifth - order - accurate .",
    "note that we use amr only to resolve the sources , and the mesh will progressively become coarser far away from the sources . although the radiation which reaches the outer boundary during the course of the simulation , with wavelengths of @xmath38 , will not be well resolved in this lowest refinement region of grid - spacing @xmath39 ( in the highest resolution run ) , reflections from there are causally disconnected from our extraction radii at @xmath40 .",
    "we do not use amr to follow the radiation with fine mesh ; instead we require only that the fixed mesh resolution in the region of the extraction surfaces be sufficient to resolve the waves there .",

    "on the other hand , the waveform from the farthest extraction radius shows signs of dissipation for the later higher - frequency portion of the waveform .",
    "this is because the radiation has propagated significantly farther , through a lower - resolution region on the computational grid , by the time it is measured at @xmath55 .",
    "the resolution in most of the intermediate region is @xmath43 , about six points per cycle for the ringdown radiation . for the rest of the paper",

    "viewing the eccentric modulation as a small perturbation on the dynamics of an optimally noneccentric inspiral , we expect that these trends would also provide a good approximation for the frequency evolution of a merger simulation begun with optimally noneccentric initial data .      in this section",
    "we consider the accuracy of the waveforms generated by our simulations , focusing primarily on the accuracy of waveform phasing information in the late - inspiral portion of our simulations .",
    "over the course of many developmental simulations leading up to these results , we found that this early low - frequency part of the simulations is the most difficult to simulate accurately .",
    "this makes sense because the crucial dynamical details are in the slow loss of energy and angular momentum to the relatively fine , evolving structure of the spacetime curvature , which ultimately comprises the radiation .",

    "@xcite we showed that there is a significant region over which the waveform from the @xmath103 numerical simulation presented above agrees with waveforms derived from pn calculations . in this section",
    "we will use the best of both treatments by joining the final segment of the bbh evolution with the pn approximation for the preceding inspiral , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : wavemain ]",
    ". we will show below that the phasing information for this waveform has an estimated accuracy of better than one - half of a gravitational wave cycle , making the waveform applicable in a variety of matched - filtering - based gravitational wave data analysis applications .",
    "we use this waveform to calculate the relative detectability of the inspiral and the merger - ringdown , as well as the detectability of the entire waveform , for iligo , adligo , and lisa .",
    "we show examples of characteristic signal strains for both classes of detectors .",
    "we also compute snrs for astrophysically interesting bbh masses , highlighting the importance of the late inspiral and merger parts of the signal .",
    "modifications of our results that may arise from bbhs with spins and unequal masses are considered .",
    "the pn waveform used for all the analyses in this section is of order 3.5pn in phase ( as derived in @xcite ) and 2.5pn beyond the quadrupole approximation in amplitude ( as derived in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the pn approximation that we use for the phase is actually an expansion of the chirp rate @xmath118 in terms of the frequency @xmath117 , which we then numerically integrate .",
    "direct numerical integration of the 3.5pn expansion of the chirp rate , @xmath119 , for example in the integrand @xmath120 , does not strictly respect the pn approximation of the phase , as the latter would require additional 3.5pn expansion of the integrand itself .",
    "however , the phase obtained in this manner will have the same convergence properties as the original @xmath119 expansion , which is arguably a more fundamental pn quantity because of its close relationship to the rate of energy loss , @xmath121 , from which it is derived .",
    "additional expansion of the phase appears to compromise its accuracy . using shorter runs",
    "it had been observed in @xcite that the phase obtained from numerical integration of the pn expansion of the chirp rate seemed to agree better with numerical simulations than did the analytic expressions ; more recently it was demonstrated in @xcite , using runs extending well into the late inspiral and with the effects of eccentricity mitigated , that the numerically integrated phase appears to be converging to the numerical result at frequencies where the full 3.5pn expansion of the phase is clearly invalid .",
    "we therefore use the numerically integrated 3.5pn chirp rate for the phasing of the pn portion of our waveform .",
    "[ fig : wavemain ] shows our numerical waveform from sec [ sec : overview ] overlaid with the pn waveform that was just described . to generate a complete , mass - scalable waveform",
    ", we match the frequency of the numerical simulation to the pn prediction , adjusting the phases to also be equal at that point as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavemain ] , and connecting the two halves to make a single waveform .",
    "this is done by shifting the pn waveform until the frequency equals the numerically - predicted frequency at a time in the simulation where the accuracy of the numerical data first surpasses the accuracy of the pn approximation , as estimated in @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite predicts this point of equivalent accuracy to occur at @xmath122 , which corresponds to @xmath123 ( shown by the circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavemain ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that there was no need to adjust the pn amplitude for continuity .",
    "the amplitude agreement with the numerical simulation is so good , and hence the resulting amplitude is so nearly continuous , that the small discontinuity fails to produce any discernible artifacts in the fourier transform @xmath124 of the resulting waveform .    having generated a waveform , it is informative to estimate the waveform",
    "s phasing accuracy over the course of the bbh evolution . note in fig .  [ fig : dph_v_om ] that for the portion of our @xmath103 simulation that is used in the waveform , we estimate @xmath125 radians of phase error .",
    "if we take the difference between 3 and 3.5 pn terms to be an estimate of the phase error as in @xcite , we can assess the error for the pn portion of the waveform .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the analytic pn phase expression accumulates very little error , on the order of @xmath126 radians , until @xmath127 .",
    "beginning our numerical phase integration at this point and evaluating up to @xmath128 yields a gravitational wave phase error of @xmath129 radians , such that the total accumulated phase error over the entire waveform is @xmath130 radians . as stated previously , an accumulated waveform phasing error of less than @xmath131 radians is the threshold below which wave - matching comparisons may be used for matched - filtering applications .",
    "we estimate that our combined waveform meets this criterion after a frequency of about @xmath132 up to the ringdown frequency , @xmath133 .",
    "we therefore have a waveform with sufficient accuracy to be useful as a template for gravitational wave detection .",
    "while templates will ultimately be needed for cases of greater astrophysical interest , and still greater accuracy will be required for the template to be useful for the purpose of parameter estimation , the construction of this waveform illustrates that the field of numerical relativity has matured to the point of being capable of producing results that are useful for gravitational wave data analysis .",
    "the calculated waveform that we have just described is actually the total strain on the equatorial plane , where @xmath134 vanishes and therefore @xmath135 provides the only contribution . to get the optimally - oriented strain amplitude ( which is the total strain passing an observer on the equatorial axis ) , we multiply this result by @xmath136 , which is the ratio of peak total gravitational wave amplitude to the amplitude of @xmath135 alone in the quadrupole approximation",
    "we then simply divide by @xmath137 in order to convert to an orientation - averaged waveform for our subsequent analyses .",
    "this factor can be understood by observing that orientation - averaging is fully equivalent to averaging over all sky positions of the detector from the perspective of the bbh , and such sky - averaging results in a factor @xmath138 in sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the snr is calculated assuming matched - filtering is performed on the data , and that the waveforms are perfect copies of the embedded signal . in this case , the sky- and waveform - polarization - averaged snr is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the characteristic signal strain and @xmath141 is the rms of the detector noise fluctuations multiplied by @xmath137 for sky - averaging , with @xmath124 and @xmath142 being the fourier transform of the signal strain and the power spectral density of the detector noise , respectively @xcite .",
    "the waveform scales with luminosity distance @xmath143 and total mass @xmath4 as @xmath144 , while the time axis for an observed wave , after redshifting , scales as @xmath145 , so that the waveform shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavemain ] is applicable over all total masses and redshifts .",

    "the pn segment is truncated at a higher frequency than the lowest frequency component of its fourier transform in order to eliminate edge effects .",
    "finally , the quasinormal ringdown at the end of the numerical simulation is extended by fitting a damping coefficient and fundamental frequency to the data in order to mitigate edge effects at the high - frequency end of the fourier transform .",
