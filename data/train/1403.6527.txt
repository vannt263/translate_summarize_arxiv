    "the naturalness problem of the electroweak scale ( ew ) and the higgs boson mass has been the most important issue for the last four decades in the theoretical particle physics community .",
    "it has provided a strong motivation to study various theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "particularly , the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) has been regarded as the most promising candidate among new physics models beyond the sm .",
    "however , any evidence of new physics beyond the sm including supersymmetry ( susy ) has not been observed yet at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and experimental bounds on susy particles are increasing gradually .",
    "nonetheless , a better new idea that can replace the present status of susy has not seemed to appear yet .",
    "accordingly , it would be worthwhile to explore a breakthrough within the susy framework .    concerning the radiative higgs mass and ew symmetry breaking , the top quark yukawa coupling ( @xmath13 ) of order unity plays the key role in the mssm : through the sizable top quark yukawa coupling , the top quark and stop make a dominant contribution to the renormalization of the soft mass parameter of the higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) as well as the radiative physical higgs mass squared ( @xmath14 ) @xcite : [ physhiggs ] & & m_h^2 ^4v_h^2  log ( ) + , + [ renormhiggs ] & &   m_h_u^2_t^2  log ( ) + , where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) denotes the top quark ( stop ) mass , and @xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs boson , @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 means a cutoff scale .",
    "a messenger scale of susy breaking is usually adopted for it .",
    "here we set the left - hand ( lh ) and right - hand ( rh ) stop squared masses , @xmath21 and @xmath22 equal to @xmath23 for simplicity .",
    "note that @xmath24 can be a large negative value for a large stop mass and a high messenger scale .    as seen in eq .",
    "( [ physhiggs ] ) , a large stop mass can raise the radiative higgs mass . according to the recent analysis based on three - loop calculations @xcite , a @xmath25@xmath26 or @xmath27 stop mass is necessary for explaining the recently observed 126 gev higgs mass @xcite without a stop mixing effect . from eq .",
    "( [ renormhiggs ] ) , however , such a heavy stop mass is expected to significantly enhance the renormalization effect on @xmath0 , and eventually it gives rise to a fine - tuning problem associated with naturalness of the ew scale . it is because a negative @xmath0 triggers the ew symmetry breaking , and eventually determines the @xmath28 boson mass in the mssm , as seen in the extremum condition of the mssm higgs potential @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the @xmath28 boson mass and @xmath31 is the `` @xmath31-term '' coefficient in the mssm superpotential .",
    "if @xmath32 is excessively large , it should be compensated with @xmath33 .",
    "thus , a fine - tuning of @xmath34@xmath35 does not seem to be avoidable in the mssm , unless the messenger scale @xmath20 is low enough .",
    "due to this reason , a relatively smaller stop mass ( @xmath36 ) has been assumed for naturalness of the ew scale , and various extensions of the higgs sector have been proposed for explaining the observed 126 gev higgs mass @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , the stop mass bound has already reached @xmath37 @xcite , which starts threatening the traditional status of susy as a solution to the naturalness problem of the ew phase transition .",
    "thus , in this paper , we intend to discuss the naturalness problem in case the stop is quite heavy ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "in fact , the renormalization of @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ renormhiggs ] ) is necessarily affected by ultraviolet ( uv ) physics .",
    "thus , for a more complete expression of it , the full renormalization group ( rg ) equations should be studied for a given uv model , even though eq .",
    "( [ renormhiggs ] ) would not be very sensitive to an uv physics in susy models .",
    "unlike the expectation based on low energy physics , however , it was claimed that the @xmath28 boson and higgs masses at low energy are quite insensitive to the stop mass in the `` focus point ( fp ) scenario '' @xcite : under the simple initial condition for the stops and higgs squared masses , @xmath39 at the grand unification ( gut ) scale , the rg solution of @xmath0 turns out to be almost independent of @xmath40 _ at the ew scale _ unlike those of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is because the coefficient of @xmath40 in the rg solution of @xmath0 at the ew scale turns out to be quite small .",
    "accordingly , @xmath0 can remain small enough even for relatively large trial @xmath40s ( @xmath41 multi - tev ) unlike other superparticles in the chiral sector .",
    "interestingly enough , moreover , the fp scenario favors the simplest version of susy model with the minimal field contents and the universal initial condition for the soft squared masses at the gut scale : many careless extensions of the mssm at low energy would destroy the fp mechanism .    the insensitivity of @xmath0 to @xmath40 or stop masses implies that eq .",
    "( [ renormhiggs ] ) is effectively canceled by other ingredients .",
    "one might expect that a fine - tuning for smallness of @xmath0 would be hidden somewhere in this scenario .",
    "this guess is actually true . as will be seen later , the smallness of the coefficient of @xmath40 in @xmath0 originates from the _ fact _ that @xmath42 here @xmath43 parametrizes the renormalization scale @xmath4 , @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 correspond to the ew and gut scale @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , respectively .",
    "actually , eq .  ( [ key ] ) is an accidental relation in some sense .",
    "just the quark and lepton masses , the low energy values of the sm gauge couplings , and the mssm field contents completely determine @xmath49 , and the @xmath28 boson mass scale and the gauge coupling unification scales provide exactly the needed energy interval . in the sense that eq .",
    "( [ key ] ) is not artificially designed , but nature might permit it , we will call it `` natural tuning . '' of course",
    ", there might exist a deep reason for it . in this paper , however , we will not attempt to explain the origin , but take a rather pragmatic attitude : we will just accept , utilize , and improve it .    however , the recently observed 126 gev higgs mass is challenging also in the fp scenario .",
    "since the fp scenario works well with the minimal field contents and a suppressed stop mixing effect , the higgs mass can be raised only through the radiative correction by the quite heavy stop , @xmath50@xmath26 or @xmath27 @xcite . to get a heavier stop mass , we need a larger @xmath40 . in order for @xmath0",
    "to remain insensitive even to much larger @xmath40s [ @xmath51 , a more precise focusing is quite essential .",
    "that is to say , the coefficient of @xmath40 in the @xmath0 s rg solution should be much closer to zero .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 does not follow the original fp scenario below the stop mass scale , because the stops are decoupled there .",
    "thus , for a predictive ew scale , the fp should appear around the stop mass scale rather than the conventional ew or @xmath28 boson mass scale .",
    "the present heavy gluino mass bound at the lhc , @xmath52 @xcite , also spoils the success of the fp scenario @xcite .",
    "the heavy gluino leads to a too large negative @xmath0 at the ew scale through rg evolution .",
    "such an rg effect by a heavy gluino mass should be compensated properly for a small enough @xmath28 boson mass .    in this paper , we will attempt just to trim the fp scenario such that the fp is made located around the stop mass scale and the heavy gluino effect becomes mild . in order to accomplish that goal",
    ", we will consider a superheavy rh neutrino @xcite , and the two - loop _ gauge _ interactions by the hierarchically heavier first and second generations of chiral superpartners ( sfermions ) @xcite .",
    "hierarchically heavy masses for the first two generations of sfermions ( @xmath53 ) could also sufficiently suppress unwanted susy flavor and susy @xmath54 violating processes as in the `` effective susy model '' @xcite .",
    "once the location of the fp is successfully modified to a desirable position , even a quite heavy stop mass could still be naturally compatible with the @xmath28 boson mass scale , and the 126 gev higgs mass can be supported dominantly by the radiative correction from such a heavy stop .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we will review the fp scenario and discuss the problems associated with the recent experimental results in sec .",
    "[ sec : fp ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : precisefp ] , we will explore the ways to move the location of the fp into a desirable position in the space of @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we will propose a simple model and discuss phenomenological constraints . section [ sec : conclusion ] will be a conclusion . for convenience , in our discussion in the main text , we will leave the details of the full rg equations and derivation of some semianalytic solutions to them in the appendix .",
    "based on our semianalytic solutions to the rg equations , let us discuss first the rg behaviors of soft parameters associated with the higgs boson and the third generation of sfermions .",
    "when @xmath55 is small enough , the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath13 dominantly drives the rg running of @xmath56 , while the bottom quark and tau lepton s yukawa couplings , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are safely ignored . here , @xmath59 denotes the `` @xmath60-term '' coefficient corresponding to the top quark yukawa coupling .",

    "<S> a small higgs mass parameter @xmath0 can be insensitive to various trial heavy stop masses , if a universal soft squared mass is assumed for the chiral superpartners and the higgs boson at the grand unification ( gut ) scale , and a focus point ( fp ) of @xmath0 appears around the stop mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> the challenges in the fp scenario are ( 1 ) a too heavy stop mass ( @xmath1 ) needed for the 126 gev higgs mass and ( 2 ) the too high gluino mass bound ( @xmath2 ) . for a successful fp scenario , we consider ( 1 ) a superheavy right - hand ( rh ) neutrino and ( 2 ) the first and second generations of hierarchically heavier chiral superpartners . </S>",
    "<S> the rh neutrino can move a fp in the higher energy direction in the space of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the renormalization scale . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the hierarchically heavier chiral superpartners can lift up a fp in that space through two - loop gauge interactions . </S>",
    "<S> precise focusing of @xmath5 is achieved with the rh neutrino mass of @xmath6 together with an order one ( @xmath7 ) dirac yukawa coupling to the higgs boson , and the hierarchically heavy masses of @xmath8 for the heavier generations of superpartners , when the u(1)@xmath9 breaking soft parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are set to be @xmath12 at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> those values can naturally explain the small neutrino mass through the seesaw mechanism , and suppress the flavor violating processes in supersymmetric models . </S>"
