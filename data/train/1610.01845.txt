    "the mathematical theory of phase transitions in continuum particle systems has much fewer results as compared to its counterpart dealing with discrete underlying sets like lattices , graphs , etc .",
    "it is quite natural that the first steps in such theories are made by employing various mean field models . in @xcite , the mean field approach",
    "was mathematically realized by using a kac - like infinite range attraction combined with a two - body repulsion . by means of rigorous upper and lower bounds for the canonical partition function obtained in that paper the authors derived the equation of state indicating the possibility of a first - order phase transition .",

    "if such two particles lie in the same cell , they repel each other with intensity @xmath5 .",
    "unlike to @xcite , we are going to deal with the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "therefore , our initial thermodynamic variables are the inverse temperature @xmath9 and the physical chemical potential . however , for the sake of convenience we employ the variables @xmath10 and @xmath11__physical chemical potential _ _ and define single - phase domains of the half - plane @xmath12 , see definition [ 1df ] , by a condition that guaranties the existence of a unique @xmath13 , which determines a probability measure @xmath14 , given in ( [ 19a ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) . in the grand canonical formalism and the approach of @xcite , this measure is set to be the thermodynamic phase of the system .",
