    "the tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy ( tdlas ) is a sensitive and fast method for gas sensing used for instance to measure concentrations of polluting gas such as ch@xmath1 and co. this technique requires the use of a tunable , stable and single mode operating source emitting in the mid infrared wavelength range beyond where strong absorption lines are present for these gas  @xcite .",
    "vcsels are highly suitable for this kind of application , however , the development of continuous wave devices operating at room temperature at this wavelength range is still an important challenge .    due to the small thickness of the gain region ,",
    "vcsel structures require high quality cavities with highly reflective bragg mirrors ( r  @xmath2  99 % ) . in the mid - infrared wavelength range , even though the best performances were obtained with algainassb material system , the relatively low index contrast ( @xmath3  0.5 ) between dbr layers make the mirrors become as thick as impairing the electro - thermal - optical properties of the structure  @xcite . currently , laser emission has been shown from an all - epitaxial monolithic microcavity near in a continuous wave mode and in quasi - cw ( 5  % , ) up to  @xcite .",
    "another hybrid structure made of a dielectric top mirror and a buried tunnel junction operates in cw emission at room temperature in the 2.4- wavelength range  @xcite .    one solution to increase the emission wavelength is the use of a high contrast grating mirror as top cavity mirror  @xcite .",
    "such gratings , combined with a low index sub - layer , can exhibit high reflectivity of more than 99.9  % for bandwidths larger than 100  nm  @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to their one dimensional symmetry , a high polarization selectivity can be performed by these mirrors and with a total thickness of less than  @xcite , the stability and quality of the vcsel emitted beam should be improved .    however , contrary to bragg mirrors , the explanation of the optical response of high contrast grating ( hcg ) is not straightforward and the design adjustment made in order to achieve the required properties for a vcsel application is still complex .",
    "even though several formalism have been defined , based for instance on the destructive interference of modes  @xcite , the use of an optimization algorithm for the design combined with a numerical computation of the reflectivity keeps the advantage of versatility .",
    "indeed , such a method easily allows the user to aim for specific properties of the hcg .",
    "it has been used for instance to design wide band and high diffraction efficiency grating  @xcite , large bandwidth grating mirror for both te and tm polarization  @xcite or , like in this work , polarization selective large bandwidth mirror with technological constraints on the design dimensions  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present a si / sio@xmath4 hcg design optimized for a vcsel application at @xmath5  .",
    "then , through a precise study of the computed tolerances of the structure dimensions , the robustness is enhanced with respect to the fabrication errors .",
    "the high contrast grating structure studied in this work is based on si / sio@xmath4 materials which properties and fabrication process are well known .",
    "the grating is made of silicium ( n  =  3.435 ) on top of a low index layer of sio@xmath4 ( n  =  1.509 ) used to achieved high reflectivity  @xcite and allowing the use of a selective etching method for the fabrication of the grating . in order to increase the total reflectivity of the reflector and",
    "broaden the stopband , two quarter wavelength layers of si / sio@xmath4 are combined with the grating  @xcite . for the simulation of the design ,",
    "the substrate is chosen as the vcsel cavity material with an optical index of n  =  3.521 .    in order to be well suitable for a vcsel application ,",
    "hcgs have to exhibit optical properties as we have defined with a 99.9  % transverse magnetic ( tm ) reflectivity for the largest possible bandwidth .",
    "moreover , to ensure a polarization stability of the emitted beam , the reflectivity of the transverse electric ( te ) mode has been chosen to be kept lower than 90 % for the whole bandwidth .",
    "a 99.5  % tm reflectivity should be enough to achieve laser emission but a 0.4  % security margin has been chosen to account for possible experimental growth imperfections and losses due to absorption . indeed , the presence of oh radicals as impurities in sio@xmath4 results in an absorption band in the 2.6- range  @xcite .",
    "in this reference , the absorption of silica has been measured with a 10 db / cm value at , i.e. the refractive index becomes @xmath6 , which results in a 0.1  % fall of the hcg reflectivity while a 0.4  % decrease of reflectivity has been observed for a simulation with a 20 db / cm attenuation coefficient ( @xmath7 ) at .",
    "this latter value appears therefore as the maximum absorption value allowed for the studied structure .",
    "however , the oh impurities concentration should strongly depends on the fabrication process and the exact value of the absorption must be determined in each case . for this theoretical study , a pure sio@xmath4 without any oh",
    "absorption was considered .",
    "nevertheless , if the silica absorption is proven to be too high , this material can be replaced by another dielectric such as si@xmath8n@xmath1 .",
    "the evaluation of the reflectivity of the mirror is made thanks to a rigorous coupled wave analysis ( rcwa )  @xcite which numerically finds an exact solution of maxwell s equations for the electromagnetic diffraction problem of an infinite grating structure .",
    "reflection spectra for te and tm modes are thus computed and through a well defined quality factor  @xcite , the optical performance of the reflector is numerically evaluated .",
    "this performance is then maximized by a genetic optimization algorithm which searches for a global maximum of the quality factor by adjusting the design .",
    "the use of a global algorithm  @xcite is mandatory in this problem since the quality factor function exhibits numerous local maxima .    , the filled length @xmath9 and the grating thickness @xmath10 is on top of a sio@xmath4 layer of thickness @xmath11 .",
    "these four parameters are adjusted to meet the characteristics of a vcsel reflector.,width=170 ]    in this work , the performances of the grating are optimized by adjusting the empty and filled lengths ( @xmath12 and @xmath9 ) , the grating thickness @xmath10 and the sublayer thickness @xmath11 as shown on figure [ scheme ] .",
    "the use of an automated optimization presents the advantage of easily imposing technological constraints on the dimensions of the structure .",
    "these constraints have been set on the lengths @xmath12 and @xmath9 limited to a minimum value of 500  nm which should ease the photolithographic process .",
    "besides , the etching process is also a critical step of the grating fabrication and , to achieve the theoretical grating profile presented on figure  [ scheme ] , the shape factor @xmath13 of the grooves is kept at a minimum value of 0.9 since squared patterns are easier to etch than deep ones .",
    "the optimization for @xmath5   of the structure shown on figure [ scheme ] results in a 307  nm large bandwidth mirror exhibiting a high polarization selectivity with @xmath14  90 % ( fig .  [ optimum ] ) .",
    "the optimum lengths of the design are given in table  [ table1 ] and satisfy the technological constraints with @xmath12  =  799  nm , @xmath9  =  541  nm and a shape factor @xmath15  =  0.9 .",
    "the grating thickness @xmath10",
    "=  886  nm and the sublayer thickness @xmath11  =  321  nm combined with the two quarter wavelength layers result in a thick reflector .",
    "even though the performances of this hcg are well adapted for a vcsel application , the tolerances of the dimensions of this grating are critical .",
    "for instance , the 884  nm minimum grating thickness leads to a maximum error allowed as small as 2  nm .",

    "this computation is made by varying one parameter at a time , for instance the grating thickness @xmath10 , while keeping the other ones ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath9 ) constant at their optimal value .",

    "however , the optimum point is not centred in these variation ranges and the real tolerance values are much more limited with for instance a maximum increase of 4  nm on the empty length @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , these variation ranges are computed separately and give no information of the simultaneous error allowed on several parameters .    a solution to access this information is to compute the variation range of combinations of two dimensions . in the following ,",
    "only ( @xmath12 ,  @xmath9 ) , ( @xmath12 ,  @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath9 ,  @xmath10 ) combinations are evaluated since the sublayer thickness @xmath11 is the most tolerant and centred parameter .",
