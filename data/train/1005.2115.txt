    "graphene is a novel form of carbon , in which the atoms are located in the nodes of a honeycomb lattice that extends periodically in two dimensions forming a single layer .",
    "@xcite in this respect , graphene is different from graphite , a substrate formed by the superposition of these layers to build a complete three dimensional structure .",
    "graphene can be obtained as a free standing structure ,  @xcite or as a single adsorbed layer on top of another substrate .",
    "@xcite one of the main interests of the scientific community on graphene is related to its unusual electron transport properties that are determined by the dirac equation ,  @xcite but other characteristics of this compound as for instance its behavior as adsorber are starting to be payed attention to .",
    "a recent diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculation of @xmath1he on graphene indicates that its behavior is quite similar to the one on graphite , the main difference being the binding energy , lower in the case of a single carbon sheet .",
    "@xcite it was also found  @xcite that the ground state of helium on graphene is a @xmath3 commensurate solid , in agreement with experimental data on graphite .",
    "@xcite the aim of the present work is to calculate the phase diagram of h@xmath0 adsorbed on graphene at zero temperature using for the first time the dmc method .",
    "the comparison with the case of graphite will show us if there is any significant difference between them or graphene is simply a weaker binding version of the graphite phase diagram , as happens with @xmath1he .    [",

    "the error bars are of the size of the symbols and not displayed for symplicity . ]",
    "[ fig3 ]    our main goal was to calculate the phase diagram of the first layer of h@xmath0 on top of both graphene and graphite until the experimental density for promotion to the second layer , 0.0937 @xmath4  @xcite and compare the results obtained . the first step towards this end",
    "is reported in fig .",
    "1 , where we show the energies per particle of a liquid phase on top of graphene ( black boxes ) and graphite ( open boxes ) .",
    "even though the liquid phase will be shown to be metastable , it is useful to calculate its properties from a methodological point of view , for the sake of comparison with other possible phases and previous calculations . in both cases",
    ", we used the same simulation cell of @xmath5 @xmath6 , with a variable number of h@xmath0 molecules on top of it to match the densities displayed in the figure .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were considered for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions .",
    "to aid in the comparison , the results for graphite were up - shifted by the difference in the binding energies in the infinite dilution limit between graphene and graphite , given in the last paragraph .",
    "since the error bars are of the size of the symbols , we can see that both curves are virtually identical .",
    "this is confirmed by a look to the results displayed in table i , that come from least - squared fitting with cubic polynomials to the dmc data displayed in fig .",
    "1 . the equilibrium densities @xmath9 in graphene and graphite are equal within error bars , and the difference between the energies per molecule at equilibrium @xmath10 is @xmath11 k after having considered the shifting due to the differences in the substrate .",
    "these results indicate that in the metastable liquid phase , the main difference between graphene and graphite as adsorbents is a nearly constant shift in the binding energies , as in the case of @xmath1he .",
    "@xcite the spinodal densities @xmath12 , defined as the points in which the derivative of the pressure with respect to the surface density equals zero , are also indistinguishable in both cases .",
    "we can compare the results obtained for the liquid phase with the ones for a purely two dimensional ( 2d ) system . in ref .",
    ", this was made in the same conditions that the ones considered here , i.e. , with the same intermolecular potential and for @xmath13 k , as corresponds to a dmc calculation ; their results are shown in table i for comparison .",
    "we can infer that the introduction of both corrugation and movement in a perpendicular direction to the basal plane have the effect of decreasing the binding energy of the liquid at zero pressure ( 21.43 for a flat surface versus around 20 k for graphene and graphite ) .",
    "experimental data of h@xmath0 on top of graphite  @xcite indicate that the liquid phase is metastable with respect to both the incommensurate and commensurate solids , as in the @xmath1he case .",
    "this feature is confirmed by the present results shown in fig .",
    "2 , where we display the energies of h@xmath0 on graphene for its liquid ( full boxes ) , commensurate @xmath2 structure ( open circle , density 0.0636 @xmath4 ) , and incommensurate triangular solid phases ( open boxes ) .",
    "the dotted line is a least - squares fit to dmc data for the latter phase with a third degree polynomial . from fig .",
    "2 , we conclude that the ground state of h@xmath0 on top of graphene is a @xmath2 commensurate ( c ) solid , as it is on graphite , whose phase diagram is similar and not shown for simplicity .",
    "the binding energies per h@xmath0 molecule for this c solid are @xmath14 and @xmath15 k for graphene and graphite , respectively .",
    "their difference ( 51.85 k ) is slightly larger than the one for the binding energy in the infinite dilution limit ( 50.78 k ) , indicating that the additional stabilization due to the extra graphite layers is more important for the c solid phase ( 1.07 versus 0.37 k ) .",
    "the energy of the c phase for graphite is slightly below the variational results of novaco  @xcite for the same structure ( @xmath16 k ) .",
    "since the binding energy of this commensurate phase is always larger than the one corresponding to the liquid phase , we conclude that for densities smaller than 0.0636 @xmath4 the system will break in h@xmath0 patches separated by empty space to produce the average density we could be interested in .    in order to establish the minimum density",
    "for which the incommensurate ( ic ) solid is stable we should make a double - tangent maxwell construction between the c and ic phases . since the c phase is defined by a single density , the construction was made by drawing the tangent line to the ic equation of state that intersects the c point .",
    "the result is depicted in fig . 3 for the case of graphene .",
    "there , we can see that the limiting density for the ic solid in equilibrium with the @xmath2 structure is 0.077 @xmath4 ( the inverse of a limiting surface per molecule of 13 @xmath6 ) , in excellent agreement with the available experimental data for graphite  @xcite between 9 and 20 k ( 0.077 @xmath17 0.001 @xmath4 @xmath18 1.22 times the density of the c phase ) .",
    "the binding energy corresponding to this structure is @xmath19 k. the lower density for graphite is exactly the same , with a binding energy of @xmath20 k. obviously , to draw the limits of this transition is only possible if we consider corrugation in the graphene and graphite structures .",
    "the limits for this c - ic transition were not calculated quantitatively in any of the previous works of h@xmath0 on graphite .",
    "@xcite there have been also other calculations on the equation of state for a triangular solid in a purely 2d environment , both at zero  @xcite and finite temperature .",
    "@xcite their main results are summarized in table ii and compared to the present results for the ic solid .",
    "however , in the context of h@xmath0 adsorption on graphene and graphite these strictly 2d results only serve as a check of the quality of our calculations , since the equilibrium density of the triangular 2d solid is below the ic density limit determined by the maxwell construction ( fig .",
    "cccc phase & @xmath21 ( @xmath4 ) & @xmath22 ( k ) & @xmath23 ( k ) + @xmath24 & 0.0789 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + @xmath27 & 0.0835 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + @xmath30 & 0.0814 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 +    we have also analyzed the possible existence of the so - called @xmath33 phase , or striped domain phase , in adsorbed h@xmath0 . according to experiments in graphite ,  @xcite it consists of strips of the c phase of variable width separated by narrow walls in which the h@xmath0 molecules are closer to each other ( see the phase diagrams in ref . ) .",
    "this phase is also present in d@xmath0 ,  @xcite and appears in the phase diagram drawn in ref .",
    "the @xmath33 structure can be defined by a rectangular cell that contains more or less h@xmath0 molecules depending on the width of the c domains . in fig .",
    "3 , we display as solid circles the cases for 4,6,8,10 and 12 molecules per simulation cell .",
    "it can be seen that they are approximately on top of the maxwell construction line that limits the c - ic transition .",
    "this result implies that we can consider the @xmath33 phase as intermediate between them , with continuous changes from the c to the @xmath33 phase , and from the @xmath33 to the ic solid , at least at @xmath13 k. this continuous change is in agreement with the experimental results of cui _ et al _ ,  @xcite which ruled out a first order change between the c and the @xmath33 arrangement .",
    "however , our results do not allow us to determine if the @xmath33 phase is a real thermodynamical phase or simply a mixture of the c and ic phases separated by striped domains .",
    "the reason is that the simulation results are below but too close to the maxwell construction line for making a definitive commitment ( see fig .",
    "the data for graphite are similarly basicaly on top of the corresponding maxwell construction line , and can be obtained from the graphene ones in fig .",
    "3 by applying a downward shift of 51.46 k.    to complete the study of h@xmath0 on top of graphene , we checked the existence of three hypothetical phases that appear in the experimental  @xcite phase diagram of d@xmath0 on top of graphite and that have not been experimentally observed in h@xmath0 .",
    "two of them are commensurate : the @xmath27 phase , which is a @xmath34 structure ( @xmath35 @xmath4 ) , and the @xmath24 phase , which corresponds to a @xmath36 arrangement ( @xmath37 @xmath4 ) .",
    "both of them are within the density limits corresponding to the ic triangular phase . in d@xmath0 on graphite",
    ", there is also an incommensurate oblique phase , which is called the @xmath30 phase , whose range of stability is approximately between 0.077 and 0.083 @xmath4 .",
    "we calculated the corresponding energies per particle for the above mentioned commensurate phases and for a single density of the @xmath30 phase ( 0.0814 @xmath4 ) , and compared them to the energies of an ic triangular phase at the same densities .",
    "the results are displayed in table iii .",
    "the main conclusion is that for h@xmath0 all these arrangements are metastable with respect to the incommensurate solid .",
    "summarizing , we have studied the phase diagram of h@xmath0 on top of graphene using the most powerful microscopic tool at zero temperature ( dmc ) , accurate potentials , and incorporating explicit c - h@xmath0 interactions ( fully corrugated model ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the first layer on graphene is fully determined for the first time .",
    "the ground state corresponds to a @xmath2 commensurate solid as happens in @xmath1he .",
    "@xcite graphene and graphite show basically the same phase diagram , the main difference being the adsorption energy , which is @xmath18 51 k larger in graphite ."
