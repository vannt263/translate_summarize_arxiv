    "the contractor renormalization group ( core ) method was invented by morningstar and weinstein @xcite , @xcite as an alternative to other real - space renormalization group methods and monte carlo techniques for the feynman path integral evaluation .",
    "the computation with the use of this method begins by restricting the full hilbert space of a single block to an appropriately chosen subspace .",
    "then , clusters of two and more blocks are considered .",
    "the overlap of the lowest lying eigenstates with the tensor products of the retained single - block eigenstates is calculated , which allows to construct a renormalized hamiltonian .",
    "then , one can iterate the renormalization group procedure ( which is straightforward if the renormalized hamiltonian has the same form as the original one ) or use some other methods to examine the properties of the effective ( renormalized ) hamiltonian .",
    "so far , the core framework has been used mainly to analyze the heisenberg model @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other applications included the 2d hubbard model @xcite and the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite .    in this paper we will apply core to the 1d heisenberg model with nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions ( the heisenberg zig - zag , also called the majumdar - ghosh model ) and to the hubbard chain in the cases of both on - site attraction and repulsion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly summarizes the core method .",
    "section 3 deals with the heisenberg zig - zag . in section 4",
    "we move on to the hubbard chain .",

    "divide the lattice into disjoint and identical blocks of @xmath2 sites .",
    "2 .   diagonalize the single - block hamiltonian @xmath3 and keep the @xmath4 lowest lying eigenstates .",
    "3 .   construct the projection operator @xmath5 on the subspace of the retained eigenstates .",
    "range-1 renormalized hamiltonian for block @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the so - called range-1 term in the cluster expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian .",
    "4 .   consider a cluster of @xmath9 connected blocks . construct the reduced hilbert space which is spanned by @xmath9 tensor products of the retained @xmath4 states .",
    "diagonalize the cluster hamiltonian and keep its @xmath10 lowest lying eigenstates eigenstates at this stage and at a later stage perform a singular value decomposition .",

    "one has a set of @xmath10 states @xmath13 .",
    "define the range-@xmath9 renormalized hamiltonian : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the eigenenergy of the @xmath16-th lowest lying eigenstate of the cluster hamiltonian .",
    "range-@xmath9 term in the cluster expansion of the renormalized hamiltonian is given by : @xmath17 i.e. one subtracts from the range-@xmath9 hamiltonian all of the terms already included in the range-@xmath16 ( @xmath18 ) computations .",
    "repeat steps 4 - 7 for more connected blocks .",
    "neglect terms including more than some specified value @xmath19 connected blocks , depending on the range of correlations in the original hamiltonian . usually , taking terms of range 2 , 3 or 4 is enough to extract the quantities of interest .",
    "the infinite - lattice renormalized hamiltonian is the sum of terms of range from 1 to @xmath19 : @xmath20",
    "in this section we will use core to calculate the ground state energy of an infinite heisenberg chain with nearest - neighbour ( n.n . ) and next - nearest - neighbour ( n.n.n . ) interactions .",

    "the range-@xmath9 terms in the cluster expansion equal : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 etc .",

    "each further block takes a factor of 64 of computer time and a factor of 16 of computer memory more , rendering calculations for bigger blocks very hard .",
    "the range-1 approximation does not depend on @xmath1 , since within a two - spin block the n.n.n .",
    "interaction is not possible .",
    "the case of @xmath33 corresponds to the heisenberg chain , for which an exact result of bethe @xcite and hulthn @xcite is known ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the core range-6 result is -0.442028 , which is just 0.25% above the exact result .",
    "the precision of this result is impossible to obtain within other approximation schemes , like the  naive  renormalization group or spin - wave approximation .",
    "the case of @xmath35 is the majumdar - ghosh limit , in which the ground state is a set of non - interacting singlets .",
    "core reproduces this result in range-1 computation , i.e. higher ranges are identically zero . for @xmath36",
    "$ ] range-5 and range-6 terms are very small .",
    "this shows that the range-6 result is very near to the exact answer , with an estimation error of the same range as for the @xmath33 case . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the core ground state energy estimates begin to diverge with the exact result being somewhere between the range-5 and range-6 curve .",
    "therefore , core , at least for the @xmath25 scheme , seems to be unreliable for @xmath37 .",
    "however , for @xmath38 , the results are very accurate .",
    "figure 1 ( right ) shows the computations of range-1 to range-4 estimates for the ground state energy for scheme b. in this case , the three - spin and nine - spin block ground states are doubly degenerate , while the six - spin and twelve - spin block ground states are non - degenerate .",
    "this difference in the block ground state structure accounts for the fact that this approximation scheme fails for all values of @xmath1 , despite the fact that the range-4 computation is as time- and memory - consuming as the range-6 calculation within scheme a. this example suggests that an appropriate blocking procedure is essential in core .",
    "the block ground state structure gives a hint of such procedure for the case of @xmath26 ",
    "one should keep ( at least ) two , instead of one , single - block states to construct the reduced hilbert space .",
    "such scheme ( @xmath39 retained states of a single - block ( @xmath26 ) hamiltonian ) will be now used . in this case , the range-2 renormalized hamiltonian for block @xmath6 takes the form : @xmath40 where the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 are to be found .",
    "the full ( infinite - lattice ) range-2 renormalized hamiltonian is the sum of all range-1 and range-2 terms : @xmath43 to obtain the estimate for the ground state energy , one has to iterate this hamiltonian infinitely many times .",
    "however , the iterations preserve this form of the hamiltonian .",
    "after @xmath16 iterations , the renormalized hamiltonian is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the parameters of renormalization for the @xmath33 heisenberg chain .",
    "thus , the ground state energy per spin is equal to the @xmath47 limit of the expression in brackets , divided by the volume of the lattice . taking into account that we have obtained an expression for an infinite geometric series , we finally get : @xmath48 for the @xmath33 case , this expression reduces to the morningstar - weinstein result @xcite for the range-2 estimate of the ground state energy of the heisenberg chain ( @xmath49 ) , just 1.2% below the exact result of bethe and hulthn .",
    "the range-3 renormalized hamiltonian for block @xmath6 takes the form : @xmath50 the full ( infinite - lattice ) range-3 renormalized hamiltonian is the sum of all , range-2 and range-3 terms : @xmath51 to obtain the estimate for the ground state energy per spin , one again has to iterate @xmath52 infinitely many times ( the form of the hamiltonian is preserved in successive iterations ) .",
    "again , the factor multiplying the identity operator after infitely many iterations gives the estimate of the ground state energy .",

    "figure 2 shows the computations of range-2 and range-3 estimates for the ground state energy per spin .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the value for range-2 and the dotted line for range-3 .",
    "the solid line is the case of range-6 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 computation ( scheme a ) , which is given for comparison ( for @xmath38 it corresponds nearly to the exact result ) . for the values of @xmath53 , all three lines almost coincide .",
    "the range-3 correction to the energy is small in this region , which is again the result of a different srtucture of the ground state for six - spin and nine - spin clusters .",
    "weinstein argues for the case of @xmath33 that the range-4 term should be much bigger than the range-3 term and shows this explicitly @xcite .",
    "one can expect that his argument holds for the nonzero-@xmath1 case , so that performing the range-4 computation should give a more exact result ( closer to the range-6 approximation in scheme a ) . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the range-2 and range-3 results differ visibly from each other and from the scheme a prediction .",
    "one can assume that again the range-4 computation should fix this problem .",
    "for @xmath1 slightly below 1 , the range-2 and range-3 lines almost meet ( the jump of the ground state energy estimate for @xmath55 is a result of the fact that the ground state energy of a nine - spin block is four - times degenerate in this case ) and for @xmath37 one can observe an ever - increasing difference between the lines , similarly to the scheme a case for @xmath37 . in this regime",
    ", core seems to fail in all of the schemes under consideration .",
    "in this section , we will show simple core calculations of the ground state energy per site of the hubbard chain at half - filling with both attractive and repulsive on - site interactions .",
    "we will retain only the ground state of block and cluster hamiltonians ( @xmath24 ) , so that the renormalized hamiltonians will be real numbers .",
    "a single block will consist of two lattice sites and we will consider clusters of at most 6 sites ( the numerical form for the six - site hamiltonian is already a @xmath56 matrix ) .",
    "the relevant formulas for @xmath31 ( @xmath57 ) are the same as in the heisenberg zig - zag case .",
    "the model hamiltonian is : @xmath58 where @xmath0 is the hopping integral , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are annihilation and creation operators for an electron of spin @xmath61 at site @xmath23 , @xmath62 is the on - site interaction strength and @xmath63 are the number operators of electrons of spin @xmath61 at site @xmath23 .",
    "the sum extends over nearest neighbours .",
    "the exact solution for the ground state energy per site in the 1d case with on - site repulsion was given by lieb and wu @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are bessel functions of zero and first order .",

    "( right ) the errors of estimation of the ground state energy per site for the hubbard chain , relatively to the exact result.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=34.0% ]    figure 3 ( left ) shows the computations of range-1 to range-3 estimates for the ground state energy per site vs. interaction strength @xmath68 .",
    "the relative errors of these calculations are given on the right side of figure 3 .",
    "one can see that the biggest error corresponds to the case of @xmath69 and is of the order of 1% ( range-3 ) and 3% ( range-2 ) . for a bigger repulsion strength and especially in the attractive case",
    "the estimation error is much smaller ( only around 0.1% for @xmath70 ) .",
    "this results from the fact that the relatively small clusters that we consider seem to be enough to capture the case when the probability that electrons are close to one another is big . at the same time ,",
    "when the tendency to localization and delocalization is comparable ( @xmath71 ) , blocks of this size are too small to accurately describe such case .    however , the relatively small divergence from the exact lieb - wu result seems to show that the mechanisms relevant for the hubbard chain at half - filling take place at distance scales of not much more than six neighbouring sites .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the core method works quite well for 1d quantum systems  the heisenberg zig - zag and the hubbard chain at half - filling .",
    "the method was tested in calculation of the ground state energy per lattice site and the results seem to be encouraging .",
    "a further test of the method would be to calculate other operators of interest in the core framework and compare it with available exact or quantum monte carlo results .",
