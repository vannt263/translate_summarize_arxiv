    "the problem as to whether meteor showers associated with near earth asteroids ( neas ) exist or not has been discussed by many authors ( e.g. , olsson - steel 1988 ; hasegawa et al .",
    "1992 ; babadzhanov 1994 ) .",
    "the most prominent case is the association between nea ( 3200 ) phaethon and the geminid stream complex .",
    "however , it should be an exceptional case since phaethon is considered to be a dormant or extinct cometary nucleus ; hence the geminid stream complex meteoroids were presumably released from phaethon in its active cometary phase ( gustafson 1989 ) .",
    "meanwhile , meteoroids of asteroidal origin certainly exist and they are usually observed and recognized as meteorites , meteoritic fireballs , or high bulk - density meteors .",
    "they are probably produced as impact ejecta by asteroidal collisions .",
    "although there is no asteroid ",
    "meteor association as strong as the phaethon ",
    "geminid complex yet , most likely the asteroidal meteor ( or meteorite ) streams indeed exist ( e.g. , halliday 1987 ; terentjeva & barabanov 2002 ; spurn et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the hayabusa ( muses - c ) sample return mission target , nea ( 25143 ) itokawa = 1998 @xmath0 , is one of the apollo - type neas , whose orbital parameters at present epoch are perihelion distance @xmath3 au and small eccentricity @xmath4 along with an inclination near the ecliptic plane at @xmath5 .",
    "the taxonomic class of itokawa is less the cometary nature than a typical s(iv)-type with rather high albedo ( e.g. , binzel et al . 2001",
    "; sekiguchi et al . 2003 ; ishiguro et al . 2003 ) .",
    "a meteoritic analog would correspond to a ll chondrite ( binzel et al .",
    "since itokawa is a small asteroid of @xmath6 m in mean axis , the escape speed from itokawa will be only @xmath7 cm s@xmath8 ( ostro et al .",
    "consequently , impact ejecta should easily escape from itokawa toward interplanetary space and some may become meteoroids",
    ". the earth approaches itokawa s orbit to within 0.05 au from late march to early july , over a span of three months , in which we would be able to observe some meteors originated from itokawa ( hereafter , we designate such a meteor as  itokawid \" ) every year . if we can obtain the orbital and physical data of the itokawid meteors , they must give us very important information when compared with the forthcoming analytical results of the hayabusa onboard scientific instruments and the sample of itokawa .",
    "on the basis of the above assumption , we surveyed whether there are itokawid meteors or not from among the optical meteor orbit database , considering orbital similarity with itokawa . as a result",
    ", we could locate itokawid meteor candidates .",
    "we also analyzed the corresponding mineral materials of the itokawid candidates through their trajectory and atmospheric data .",
    "we called japanese visual - meteor observers to watch the itokawid meteor activity through the observing campaign from the 2001 season .",
    "however , no detection has been reported so far .",
    "this is supported by the negative results of the japanese fireball network ( jn ) monitoring , a total of @xmath9 hr , during the 20002004 seasons .",
    "one of the reasons is that a predicted geocentric velocity for the itokawids is very slow at only @xmath10 km s@xmath8 , which should scatter their apparent radiants in a large celestial area around leonis .",
    "this makes it difficult for visual meteor observers to distinguish a member of the itokawids or not .",
    "another reason is that the activity of asteroidal meteors is substantially weak .",
    "indeed , we could not find any past itokawid records in the several visual meteor catalogues .",
    "thus , the itokawid activity has never been reported by single - station visual meteor observers .    unlike the visual meteor observations",
    ", we might trace itokawid activity by retrieving data from the meteor orbit database recorded by multiple - station observations . considering the orbital similarity with itokawa",
    ", we surveyed whether there are itokawid meteors among the multi - station optical ( photographic and tv ) meteor orbit data of @xmath1 orbits .",
    "our database includes : i ) the iau mdc optical meteor orbit data of @xmath11 orbits as of august , 2001 ( lindblad 2001 ; lindblad et al . 2001 ) , based upon many astronomical papers that have been published ( steel 1996 ) ; ii ) 6500 more optical meteor orbits from released catalogues on the internet websites ( e.g. dms additional photo and tv ; mss - wg tv ; ondrejov tv ; etc . ) and unpublished tmn photographic and jn fireball reductions ; and iii ) super - schmidt graphical reductions ( mccrosky & posen 1961 ) of @xmath12 orbits , although they were not included in the iau mdc photographic meteor data ( lindblad 2001 ) by reason of their lower precision than other photographic reductions ; they are comparable in quality to the tv reductions and hence they deserve to be retrieved here .    in investigating the orbital similarity between meteors or a comet / asteroid and meteors ,",
    "we often use the @xmath2-criteria , e.g. @xmath13 ( southworth & hawkins 1963 ) ; @xmath14 ( drummond 1979 ) ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( valsecchi et al .",
    "we applied these @xmath2-criteria as a retrieving engine , mainly taking account of discrimination @xmath17 .",
    "the traditional @xmath13 is defined by a distance of two points of two objects ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) in the five - dimensional coordinate space systemized by the orbital elements , @xmath20 : eccentricity , @xmath21 : perihelion distance , @xmath22 : argument of perihelion , @xmath23 : longitude of the ascending node , and @xmath24 : inclination , as follows ( southworth & hawkins 1963 ) : @xmath25 ^ 2 = ( e_a - e_b)^2+(q_a - q_b)^2+[2 \\sin ( i_{ab } / 2)]^2 \\\\ + \\{[(e_a+e_b ) / 2][2 \\sin ( \\mathit{\\pi}_{ab } / 2)]\\}^2 \\nonumber \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the angle between both orbital planes and @xmath27 is the difference between the longitudes of perihelion measured from the intersection of the orbits .",
    "therefore , you can easily comprehend that the smaller @xmath13 is , the stronger the association between itokawa and meteor will be .",
    "we found five itokawid meteor candidates , as listed in table 1 , where the column heads from left to right are as follows : object name , observed date of the meteors in ut , @xmath20 , @xmath21 in au , @xmath28 : semimajor axis in au , the angular elements , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in degree in j2000 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 : right ascension and declination of the geocentric radiant in degree in j2000 , and @xmath31 : geocentric velocity in km s@xmath8 .",
    "the orbital parameters of itokawa at epoch 2004 july 14.0 tt (= jdt 2453200.5 ) taken from the nasa - jpl neo program website are also presented in table 1 , when mean anomaly was @xmath32 .",
    "the equinox of angular data , except for those of the meteor 00504004 , was transformed from b1950 to j2000 .",
    "the results of the @xmath2-criteria are also given in table 2 , where the column heads are the following : object name , @xmath13 between itokawa and each meteor , @xmath33 and @xmath34 : longitude and latitude of the perihelion in degree in j2000 ( main terms of @xmath14 ) , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 : unperturbed geocentric encounter velocity to the earth and cosine of the angle between @xmath35 and the direction of earth s heliocentric motion ( main terms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xmath35 equals @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the tisserand s invariant of each object with respect to jupiter .",
    "the meteors , h7220 and h10330 , were picked out from the super - schmidt graphical reductions ( mccrosky & posen 1961 ) .",
    "@xmath13 between itokawa ",
    "h7220 is 0.05 , the smallest among all the itokawa ",
    "meteor pairs and comparable to the confirmed comet  meteor associations ( e.g. , 55p  leonids , 103p  perseids , phaethon  geminids ; and others ) ; thus both objects are probably associated with one another .",
    "although outside the predicted months mentioned above , the meteor , ha10000 , came from the super - schmidt automatic reductions ( mccrosky & shao 1967 ) .",
    "the fireball , morp172 , was multiply photographed by the canadian fireball network , meteorite observation and recovery project ( morp ) , on april 11 , 1975 ( halliday et al . 1996 ) ; @xmath13 of 0.09 between itokawa  morp172 is somewhat larger than that of itokawa  h7220 .",
    "however it is still within a probable association range .",
    "it is also notable that the secular near - invariants of morp172 in the @xmath35-@xmath39 coordinates match well with those of itokawa .",
    "this suggests that both objects are dynamically in strong relationship to each other ( valsecchi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ table2 ]    the tv meteor , 00504004 , was recorded by the ondrejov observatory team ( koten et al .",
    "2003 ) on may 4 , 2000 ; the @xmath13-criterion with itokawa is just outside the 0.15-limit , but its @xmath33 and @xmath34 are very close to those of itokawa and hence in a possible association range .    true anomaly of these meteors , at observed epoch , equals @xmath40 for the super - schmidt meteors and morp172 and @xmath41 for the meteor , 00504004 .",
    "furthermore , we approached the above subject in a physical analysis , in order to ascertain the association between itokawa and the itokawid candidates .",
    "unfortunately , most of the physical information ( e.g. , bulk density , ablation coefficient , spectral data , etc . ) , are not given in the published data , except for the mass data .",
    "however , we could analyze corresponding mineral matters of the itokawid candidates through their trajectory and atmospheric data instead , i.e. , atmospheric density at meteor s luminous height , velocity , entry angle to earth atmosphere , and mass , using ceplecha s ( 1988 ) classification .",
    "the itokawid candidates are classified on the basis of evaluating the coefficients @xmath42 only for optical ( super - schmidt and tv ) meteors and @xmath43 and @xmath44 only for fireballs . in these evaluations",
    ", we adopted the atmospheric data from cira1965 .",
    "the results of classification are summarized in table 3 , where the column heads from left to right are as follows : object name , @xmath45 : initial velocity in km s@xmath8 , @xmath46 : cosine of zenith distance of the apparent radiant , @xmath47 and @xmath48 : beginning and end height of meteor in km , @xmath49 : initial ( photometric ) mass in gram , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , classified group , and classified mineral matter . it should be also noted that the @xmath42 coefficient for the tv meteors is adjusted adding 0.15 and the logarithm of the total luminosity of morp172 for @xmath44 is 3.31 ( in 0 mag sec ) .",
    "[ tab3 ]    these evaluations indicate all the itokawid candidates evidently belong to asteroidal meteors , as shown in table 3 : all the super - schmidt and tv meteors are classified in the range of group a as carbonaceous chondrite ( @xmath50 ) , while the fireball morp172 is in group i as ordinary chondrite by @xmath43 classification , @xmath51 , but in group ii as carbonaceous chondrite by @xmath44 classification , @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the classified mineral matter of morp172 shows more similarity to itokawa s surface composition of a ll chondrite analogue suggested by binzel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) than the four other meteors .",
    "interestingly , according to halliday et al ( 1989 ) , morp172 was observed as a likely meteorite dropping fireball with an estimated terminal mass of @xmath53 kg ; this meteorite might have fallen , and still remains , somewhere near edam , canada .",
    "as a result of a survey of the itokawid meteors from among our multi - station optical meteor orbit data of @xmath1 orbits , and applying the orbital similarity criteria , @xmath2-criteria , we could find five itokawid meteor candidates .",
    "two out of them , the meteor h7220 and the fireball morp172 , are probably associated with itokawa , judging from their @xmath13 values .",
    "it is also notable that the secular near - invariants of morp172 in the @xmath35-@xmath39 coordinates match well with those of itokawa : this suggests both objects have a strong dynamical relationship to each other .",
    "the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 evaluations indicate all the itokawid candidates evidently belong to asteroidal meteors .",
    "morp172 is the only one classified at ordinary / carbonaceous chondrite , the others being in carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "hence , the classified mineral matter of morp172 shows more similarity to itokawa s surface composition of a ll chondrite analogue than the other candidates .",
    "we conclude , on the basis of the investigations above , that the fireball , morp172 , is the strongest itokawid candidate . however , if you ask whether there are itokawid meteors or not , we will answer ,  possible \" , since only a small sample like this is available so far",
    ". therefore , more optical detections and analyses for the itokawid meteors are desirable in the future work .",
