    "gluon fusion and weak - boson fusion ( wbf ) are expected to be the most copious sources of higgs bosons in @xmath0 collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and a future very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) . beyond representing the most promising discovery processes",
    "@xcite , these two production modes are also expected to provide a wealth of information on higgs couplings to gauge bosons and fermions  @xcite .",
    "the extraction of higgs boson couplings , in particular , requires precise predictions of production cross sections .",
    "a key component of the program to measure higgs boson couplings at a @xmath0 collider is the wbf process , @xmath3 via @xmath4-channel @xmath5 or @xmath6 exchange , characterized by two forward quark jets  @xcite .",
    "qcd radiative corrections to wbf are known to be small  @xcite and , hence , this process promises small systematic errors .",
    "jet production via gluon fusion , while part of the inclusive higgs signal , constitutes a background when trying to isolate the @xmath8 and @xmath9 couplings responsible for the wbf process .    in two recent papers",
    "@xcite we presented the details of the calculation and some results for the real - emission corrections to gluon fusion which lead to @xmath7  parton final states , at order @xmath10 , at lhc energies .",
    "the contributing subprocesses include quark - quark scattering which involves top - quark triangles , quark - gluon scattering processes which are mediated by top - quark triangles and boxes , and @xmath11 which requires pentagon diagrams in addition . in these papers we investigated the validity of the large top - mass limit ( @xmath12 ) by comparing a few distributions computed using the heavy - top effective lagrangian  @xcite with the corresponding ones computed keeping @xmath13 finite .",
    "in addition , we studied the renormalization and factorization scale - dependence of the resulting @xmath7  jet cross section , and discussed some phenomenologically important distributions at the lhc .    in this contribution , we extend the analysis to the higher energy @xmath0 collisions of a vlhc , at center of mass energies @xmath14 and 200  tev .",
    "in particular , we investigate the cuts that need to be applied in order to enhance wbf signals with respect to gluon fusion contributions .",
    "the gluon - fusion processes at @xmath16 , together with weak - boson fusion , are expected to be the dominant sources of @xmath7  jet events at the lhc and vlhc .",
    "the relative size of the two contributions decides the impact which gluon - fusion will have on the study of wbf processes .",
    "the gluon - fusion cross sections diverge as the final - state partons become collinear with one another or with the incident beam directions , or as final - state gluons become soft . a minimal set of cuts on the final - state partons",
    "is required to define a finite @xmath7  jet cross section , and these cuts should at the same time anticipate detector capabilities and jet finding algorithms .",
    "we consider two broadly defined sets of cuts : a selection for generic @xmath7  jet events ( called `` inclusive cuts '' ) and a more stringent selection which is typical for wbf studies ( `` wbf cuts '' ) . in going from lhc to the higher vlhc energies",
    ", harder jet cuts will have to be imposed , in particular on the jet transverse momentum , @xmath17 .",
    "we distinguish between lhc and vlhc specific cuts :    *   inclusive cuts [ e4_oleari_0927_sec_eq : incl_lhc ] lhc : & & p_tj>20  gev ,    [ e4_oleari_0927_sec_eq : incl_vlhc ] vlhc : & & p_tj>30  gev , |_j|<6 , r_jj>0.6 , *   wbf cuts : previous inclusive cuts plus  @xcite [ e4_oleari_0927_sec_eq : wbf_lhc ] lhc : & & |_j_1-_j_2|>4.2 , _",
    "j_1_j_2<0 , m_jj>600  gev , + [ e4_oleari_0927_sec_eq : wbf_vlhc ] vlhc : & & |_j_1-_j_2|>5 , _",
    "j_1_j_2<0 , m_jj>3  tev .    in general , the gluon fusion differential cross section tends to peak for central jets and and at a relatively small invariant mass , @xmath18 , of the dijet system .",
    "this is because final - state gluons tend to be soft and the energy of initial gluons is restricted due to the rapid fall - off of the gluon distribution , @xmath19 , with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "the wbf cuts then enhance the wbf contribution with respect to gluon fusion .",
    "for the inclusive cuts , which allow soft events , the gluon fusion cross section dominates over wbf by a factor 310 .",
    "the wbf cuts force the two tagging jets to be well separated in pseudorapidity , @xmath21 , they must reside in opposite detector hemispheres and they must possess a large dijet invariant mass .",
    "the combination of these requirements forces the gluon fusion cross section below the wbf rate for all machine energies .",
    ".total cross section , in picobarn , for @xmath7 jet production , in @xmath0 collisions at lhc ( @xmath1  tev ) and vlhc ( @xmath2  tev ) for three different values of the higgs mass @xmath22 .",

    "the gluon fusion cross sections depend only weakly on the higgs mass .",

    "( but without the @xmath18 constraint ) they are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mjj_wbf_cuts ] . at machine energies below 100  tev",
    ", wbf soon dominates the @xmath18 distribution : a relatively modest @xmath18 requirement ( 500  gev at the lhc , 1  tev at a 50  tev machine ) will suffice , while retaining most of the wbf signal . at higher collision energies wbf only dominates at very large dijet invariant masses , and cuts at 2 or 4",
    "tev will come at a huge cost of wbf cross section .",
    "in addition , since the jet transverse momenta in wbf events are tied to the weak boson masses , such cuts leave us with dijet systems with very large rapidity separation .",
    "containing such events will require superior rapidity coverage of vlhc detectors , up to @xmath26 .",
    "as the center - of - mass energy is increased at very high energy hadron colliders , the mix of @xmath7  jet events shifts more and more to gluon fusion induced events , even with cuts geared towards the enhancement of weak boson fusion .",
    "a separation of the two sources is partially possible with the rapidity and invariant mass cuts discussed above .",
    "however , other distinguishing characteristics will have to be exploited .",
    "chief among these will be the different color structure of the events : @xmath4-channel color singlet exchange for wbf , @xmath4-channel color octet exchange for gluon fusion .",
    "the resulting suppression of soft jets in the central region for wbf events  @xcite will need to be studied in detail to prepare tools for the isolation of wbf events at a vlhc .",
