    "sx phoenicis stars are short - period ( @xmath12 ) pulsating variable stars .",
    "they have low metallicities and high spatial motions typical of population ii @xcite .",
    "they are located in a blue straggler region in the hr diagram and within the lowest section of the classical cepheid instability strip .",
    "the characteristics of these stars are not yet fully explained by current stellar theories .",
    "only a few field sx phe stars are known at present , and most of the known sx phe stars were discovered in galactic globular clusters and in two dwarf spheroidal galaxies , carina and sagittarius .",
    "recently , @xcite published a catalogue of sx phe stars in galactic globular clusters including those in the two dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "they listed a total of 122 sx phe stars belong to 18 globular clusters and 27 belonging to 2 galaxies , covering information published until january , 2000 . since the initial discovery of sx phe stars in the globular cluster @xmath13 cen @xcite",
    ", the identification rate of these stars in globular clusters has increased rapidly in the last decade ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we report the first discovery of an sx phe star ( hereafter referred to as sxp1 ) in the globular cluster m15 ( ra=21@xmath14 29@xmath15 58@xmath163 , dec=+12@xmath17 10@xmath18 01@xmath19 , j2000 ; @xcite ) .",
    "m15 has an extremely low metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath20 , an interstellar reddening @xmath21 , and a distance modulus @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "there are 126 known variable stars in m15 but no sx phe star had yet been discovered in this cluster @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from this study were presented by @xcite .",
    "we have obtained @xmath23 ccd images of m15 on the photometric night of september 13 , 1998 , and a series of @xmath0 ccd images of m15 on four nights from august 12th to 16th , 1999 and over 2 nights from september 25th to 26th , 2000 .",
    "a total of 194 ( over @xmath2429.7 hours ) , and 232 ( over @xmath2432.1 hours ) frames were obtained for @xmath4- and @xmath7-bands , respectively .",
    "the observation log is listed in table 1 .",
    "the ccd images were obtained with a thinned site 2k ccd ( @xmath25 pixels ) camera attached to the 1.8 m telescope at the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory(boao ) .",
    "the size of the field of view of a ccd image is @xmath26 at the f/8 cassegrain focus of the telescope .",
    "the readout noise and gain of the ccd are 7.0@xmath27 and 1.8e@xmath28adu , respectively .",
    "we used the @xmath29 binning mode , resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath30 arcsec per pixel .",
    "a greyscale map of a @xmath7 ccd image of m15 is shown in figure 1 .      using the iraf / ccdred package , we processed the ccd images to correct overscan regions , trim unreliable subsections , subtract bias frames and correct flat field images .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were obtained using the point spread function fitting photometry routine in the iraf / daophot package @xcite .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the stars in m15 observed on september 13 , 1998 were transformed to the standard system using photometry of the landolt standard stars obtained on the same night as m15 @xcite .",
    "then the time - series @xmath0 data were calibrated using these data .",
    "detailed analysis and results of the @xmath23 photometry of m15 will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we applied the ensemble normalization technique @xcite to normalize instrumental magnitudes between time - series ccd frames .",
    "we used about a hundred normalizing stars ranging from 140 to 175 for the @xmath7-band and from 135 to 173 for the @xmath4-band except for variable stars and central stars within r @xmath3 15 .",
    "the normalization equation is @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the standard and instrumental magnitudes of the normalizing stars , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 is the zero point and @xmath35 is the color coefficient . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are used to correct position dependent terms such as atmospheric differential extinction and variable psf .",
    "after photometric reduction of the time - series frames , we inspected luminosity variations for about 21,000 stars to search for variable stars .",
    "we confirmed 86 previously known rr lyrae stars and one cepheid variable , and discovered 16 new variable stars in the cluster : two faint eclipsing binaries , two long - period variable stars , three rr lyrae stars , eight variable candidates , and one sx phe star ( sxp1 ) .",
    "here we report only the results on the sx phe star , and detailed results on the other variable stars will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there had been hitherto no previously known eclipsing binaries or sx phe stars in m15 @xcite .",
    "sxp1 is the first sx phe star discovered in m15 .",
    "sxp1 is located 1028 north and 2856 west of the center of m15 , as marked by the v in figure 1 .",
    "the coordinates of sxp1 are ra(2000)=21@xmath14 29@xmath15 39@xmath164 and dec(2000)=@xmath38 11@xmath18 43@xmath394 .",
    "@xmath0 light curves ( dots ) of sxp1 we obtained are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the curves are sinusoidal with short periods and low amplitudes showing that sxp1 is a pulsating variable star .",
    "the maximum amplitudes of sxp1 in the @xmath4- and @xmath7-bands are estimated to be @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that there are amplitude - modulating features in the light curves of sxp1 , implying the excitation of closely [ ] separated pulsating frequencies .",
    "we have performed multiple - frequency analysis to find the pulsating frequencies of sxp1 using the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) method and linear least - squares fitting method @xcite .",
    "figure 3 displays the power spectra of sxp1 for the @xmath4- and @xmath7-bands .",
    "the top panel in figure 3 shows the spectral window , and the other panels represent the pre - whitening processes .",
    "a primary frequency at @xmath9 c / d for both bands is evident .",
    "after the primary frequency @xmath42 is prewhitened ( the third panels from the top in figure 3 ) , the secondary frequency is detected at @xmath10 c / d for the @xmath4-band and 24.343 c / d for the @xmath7-band . since the amplitude signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) are larger than 4 @xcite , the secondary frequencies can be accepted as intrinsic frequencies . after removing synthetic curves with the two frequencies from the data ,",
    "the residual light curves indicate that there are no more frequencies detectable in the data ( see the bottom panels in figure 3 ) .",
    "the results of the multiple - frequency analysis for sxp1 are summarized in table 2 .",
    "synthetic light curves obtained from this analysis are superimposed on the data in figure 2 , and show good agreement .",
    "in figure 4 , we show the position of sxp1 in the color - magnitude diagram ( hereafter cmd ) of m15 .",
    "sxp1 is found to be located in the blue straggler region along an extension of the main sequence , in a region brighter and bluer than the main sequence turnoff point .",
    "the mean magnitudes of sxp1 are @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 = @xmath44 and @xmath3@xmath7@xmath5 = @xmath45 . based on the position of sxp1 in the cmd in conjunction with its pulsation period and amplitude",
    ", it could either be an sx phe star in the globular cluster or a field @xmath43 scuti star . in order to define the pulsating type of sxp1 more clearly , we examined the @xmath7-amplitude versus period diagram for sx phe stars and @xmath43 scuti stars in figure 5 .",
    "the sources of the data are @xcite for field sx phe stars and @xmath43 scuti stars , and @xcite for sx phe stars in galactic globular clusters .",
    "figure 5 shows that the @xmath7-amplitude and period of sxp1 is consistent with those for other sx phe stars in globular clusters and that the @xmath7-amplitude of sxp1 is much larger than those of @xmath43 scuti stars with the same period .",
    "this shows that sxp1 is an sx phe star , not a @xmath43 scuti star .",
    "following the suggestion of @xcite that sx phe stars with @xmath46@xmath7 @xmath47 can be classified as first - overtone pulsators , we can assume that sxp1 is a first - overtone pulsator .",
    "after fundamentalizing the dominant frequency @xmath42 by assuming a fundamental to first overtone period ratio @xmath48 , we obtain the absolute magnitude of sxp1 , @xmath49 and the distance modulus , @xmath5061 using the period - luminosity ( @xmath51 ) relation given by mcnamara ( 1997 ; his eq.(4 ) , @xmath52 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite established the equations for the magnitudes of the horizontal branch and the main - sequence turnoff : @xmath53 + 0.92 $ ] and @xmath54 - 4.48 $ ] . using these equations",
    "we obtain @xmath55 = 0.24 and @xmath56 = 3.71 for [ fe / h ] = 2.25 , the metallicity of m15 . from the color magnitude diagram of m15 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , the magnitudes of the horizontal branch and the main - sequence turnoff are , respectively , @xmath57 = 15.80 and @xmath58 = 19.30 . therefore , the corresponding absolute magnitudes of sxp1 are @xmath59 = 288 from @xmath55 and 285 from @xmath56 .",
    "these are in good agreement with the absolute magnitude of sxp1 , @xmath59 = 2.84 derived from the p - l relation .",
    "if we use the period - luminosity - metallicity ( @xmath60 [ fe / h ] ) relation given by @xcite , @xmath61[fe / h ] @xmath62 , we obtain the distance modulus of @xmath6349 , adopting the cluster metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these two results are consistent within 2@xmath64 ( for @xmath51 relation ) or 1@xmath64 ( for @xmath60 [ fe / h ] relation ) error with the distance modulus of m15 , @xmath5037 @xmath65 @xcite . the fundamentalized @xmath42 period and [ fe / h ] relation of sxp1 is also consistent with the metallicity - period relation of other sx phe stars in the galactic globular clusters @xcite , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "all of these facts support the contention that sxp1 is a member of m15 , and also an sx phe star in the cluster .",
    "it should be noted that the two detected frequencies of sxp1 are very closely separated ( frequency ratio = 0.988 ) .",
    "this is often seen in the case of low - amplitude @xmath43 scuti stars , but it is very rare for sx phe stars . up to now , only one sx phe star , bl cam @xcite , among the known sx phe stars is known to have very closely separated frequencies ( frequency ratio @xmath66 0.95 ) .",
    "these frequencies can be explained by excitation of a nonradial mode @xcite .",
    "however , the excitation of nonradial modes has not yet been physically understood in the case of sx phe stars with relatively high amplitudes .",
    "recently , nonradial pulsation components were also detected from the frequency analysis of first overtone rr lyrae stars @xcite . to identify the pulsation mode of sxp1",
    ", we tried to obtain the phase differences between the color index ( @xmath67 ) and the @xmath7 magnitude @xcite , but failed because our data are not of sufficient quality to obtain the variation of color index .",
    "better data are needed to identify the pulsation mode of sxp1 .",
    "we have discovered the first sx phe star ( sxp1 ) in the globular cluster m15 from @xmath0 ccd photometry .",
    "table 3 summarizes physical parameters of sxp1 derived in this study .",
    "two very closely separated frequencies are detected in the light curves of sxp1 , which could be explained by excitation of a nonradial mode .",
