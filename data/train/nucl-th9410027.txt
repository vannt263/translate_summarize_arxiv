    "recently a @xmath0=4 staggering effect in the dynamical moment of inertia of some superdeformed bands has been observed @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as a bifurcation of the yrast band into two sequences with spins varying by 4 units within each sequence .",
    "the corresponding energy splitting is very small , i.e. , about 100 ev . this effect may occur due to remnants of the @xmath2 symmetry of the system and suggests that presence of hexadecapole deformations or hexadecapole - type multipole interactions may be responsible for the staggering phenomenon",
    "recently , the origin of the staggering has been discussed by means of a phenomenological hamiltonian containing higher - order terms in angular momentum @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the effect by means of a more microscopic approach involving schematic multipole - multipole interactions .",
    "the model to test the @xmath0=4 staggering phenomenon should be able to take into account the interplay between rotation and shape dynamics of a many - body system . a degenerate single-@xmath1 shell occupied by identical nucleons @xcite , interacting via quadrupole - quadrupole and hexadecapole - hexadecapole multipole forces has this property .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian may be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the quadrupole and hexadecapole moment operators defined as @xmath6=@xmath7 where @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath11 is the time reversal operator , and the dot symbol stands for the scalar product @xmath12@xmath13@xmath12=@xmath14 . in the harmonic oscillator approximation @xcite the values of coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be estimated as @xmath17 the results of the diagonalization depend solely on the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , in the following , we assumed @xmath15=1  mev ( i.e. , @xmath15 is used to fix energy scale ) , while the parameter @xmath16 , describing the relative strength of hexadecapole and quadrupole interactions , was varied to investigate the conditions for an appearance of the staggering effect .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the case of @xmath19=8 particles in the @xmath1=15/2 shell , although we have performed a series of calculations for several different shells and particle numbers .",
    "a choice of @xmath19=8 particles corresponds to a half - filled shell , and gives a regular collective yrast band .",
    "the calculations were performed for the parameter @xmath16 ranging from @xmath16=0 to @xmath16=10  mev . for larger values of @xmath16 ,",
    "one only obtains an energy scaling corresponding to the dominating hexadecapole interaction .",
    "to analyse a @xmath0=4 staggering effect in collective bands , we extracted the smooth reference curve according to ref .",
    "quantities @xmath20@xmath9@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 and @xmath26@xmath9 @xmath27@xmath22@xmath23@xmath22@xmath28@xmath22@xmath29@xmath24@xmath30/4 $ ] were obtained in this way .",
    "then staggering parameter @xmath31@xmath24@xmath26 was evaluated and plotted in each case .",
    "fig .  [ f1 ] shows a complete quadrupole spectrum of hamiltonian ( [ a1 ] ) in case of @xmath16=0 .",
    "solid lines connect states of spins @xmath32 and @xmath32@xmath222 with the largest reduced matrix elements of the quadrupole moment operator .",
    "several quite regular rotational bands were obtained .",
    "the staggering parameter was evaluated for each case , but no @xmath0=4 periodicity was found . in figs .",
    "[ f2 - 3]a and [ f2 - 3]b the collective energies @xmath33 and the parameters @xmath31@xmath24@xmath26 of the yrast sequence are presented as open circles . when the hexadecapole interaction is switched on",
    ", the staggering @xmath0=4 appears .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ f2 - 3]b , where full circles denote the staggering parameters of the yrast band for @xmath16=0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5  mev , while the corresponding yrast spectra are plotted in fig .  [ f2 - 3]a .",
    "the staggering effect is small and therefore difficult to be directly seen in the yrast spectra .    the amplitude of the staggering increases with @xmath16 ,",
    "but for the values of @xmath16 larger than 0.5  mev , the yrast states are no longer connected by the enhanced e2 transitions ; i.e. , the band structure is lost .",
    "[ f4 - 5]a shows the yrast states for @xmath16=4  mev .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where the hexadecapole interaction dominates and the yrast sequence is strongly perturbed .",
    "there are no strong e2 transitions linking the yrast states , but the staggering parameter extracted from the energies of the yrast sequence exhibits the @xmath0=4 periodicity ( fig .",
    "[ f4 - 5]b ) .",
    "similar effects can be obtained for other values of @xmath1 and @xmath19 .",
    "we would like to stress that it was impossible to obtain similar staggering by using the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction alone . on the other hand , for @xmath1=15/2 and @xmath19=8",
    ", the staggering appears only in the yrast band .",
    "the examples presented here show that the hexadecapole interaction may generate the @xmath0=4 irregularities .",
    "the proper treatment of the hexadecapole interaction seems to be crucial for the understanding of this intriguing staggering phenomenon .",
