    "the seminal work by hodgkin and huxley @xcite , on mathematical description of action potential generation , has led to a whole series of models that describe in detail the dynamics of various ionic currents and the effect of the dendritic architecture on signal integration , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the precise description of neuronal activity involves a large number of variables , which often prevents a clear understanding of the underlying dynamics .",
    "hence , a simplified description is desirable and has been subject of numerous studies ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the most popular simplified models include the integrate - and - fire model @xcite , the fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite and the morris - lecar model @xcite . however , it is not clear if such simplified models are sufficient to capture the essence of neuronal dynamics .",
    "indeed , reduced models of neuronal activity , as opposed to detailed models of the hodgkin - huxley - type , are commonly thought to be too simple to account for the rich firing behavior of real neurons .    nevertheless , these highly simplified models have been shown to yield good predictions when compared to biological data @xcite .",
    "in particular , several parameter estimation and/or optimization techniques have been proposed to map reduced models to real neurons @xcite .",
    "these techniques allow to map electrophysiological data from biological neurons ( intracellular or extracellular recordings ) onto simplified models of the integrate - and - fire - type .",
    "moreover , such a mapping could be the starting point of a systematic classification of cortical neurons in terms of simplified dynamics .",
    "finally , reduced models have been used extensively and successfully to model and study analytically the behaviour of cortical - like networks @xcite .",
    "in other words , analytical and computational tools are available to go from a simple description of single cells dynamics to network dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we review and extend a numerical technique that allows a systematic mapping of a class of integrate - and - fire neuron models , namely the spike response model @xcite , to intracellular recordings of neuronal activity @xcite . while this technique ensures reliable predictions and good generalization when the target neuron is driven by a randomly fluctuating _ current _ , it was shown in a previous study @xcite that the generalization power is poor when the target neuron is driven by randomly fluctuating synaptic _",
    "conductances_. hence , the purpose of this paper is to propose extensions of our previous work which addresses this latter problem . using recent theoretical results @xcite",
    ", we propose a generalization of the spike response model so as to make model parameters input - dependent . this improved version of the srm is shown to be very efficient and robust at predicting the spike train of a detailed hodgkin - huxley type neuron model .",
    "we consider a neuron stimulated by stochastic presynaptic spike arrival .",
    "the state of the neuron is characterized by a single variable @xmath1 , the membrane voltage of the cell at the soma .",
    "let us suppose that the neuron has fired its last spike at time @xmath2 . at time @xmath3 , the membrane potential of the cell is described as : @xmath4 the last two terms account for the drive by presynaptic neurons @xmath5 ( respectively @xmath6 ) of the excitatory @xmath7 ( respectively inhibitory @xmath8 ) population . @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the firing time of presynaptic neurons .",
    "the @xmath11-functions describe the excitatory ( @xmath12 ) and inhibitory ( @xmath13 ) postsynaptic potentials ( epsps and ipsps ) .",
    "@xmath14 describes the form of the spike itself as well as the after - hyper - polarization potential , if present .",
    "a spike is elicited if the following threshold condition is satisfied : @xmath15 note that spiking occurs only if the membrane voltage crosses the threshold @xmath16 from below .",
    "the threshold itself can be taken either as a constant or as time - dependent . in this paper",
    ", we use a dynamic threshold with the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a fixed absolute refractory period so as to exclude continuous firing .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are parameters that will be chosen to yield the best fit to a target spike train ( see section [ sec - mapping ] below ) .",
    "this version of the spike response model ( the one that we use in this paper ) is a simplified version of the full spike response model and has been termed srm@xmath22 ( see @xcite for further details )",
    ". we will use this acronym to refer to this model .",
    "( [ equ - srm ] ) can be restated in the form : @xmath23 with : @xmath24 for numerical implementation , we will use a discrete version of @xmath25 s : @xmath26 i.e. @xmath27 is the spike count in a time bin of duration @xmath28 in the excitatory presynaptic population and analogously for @xmath29 . the activity ( population rate ) @xmath30 of the excitatory presynaptic population",
    "is defined as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the size of the presynaptic population ( with a corresponding definition for the inhibitory population ) .",
    "the mapping technique that we propose has been discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite and we refer interested readers to this reference . here",
    ", we describe the essentials of the technique without going into details .",
    "to realize the mapping of the srm@xmath22 to the target neuron , we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we extract the functions characterizing the model ( epsp @xmath33 , ipsp @xmath34 and spike shape @xmath35 ) and second , we choose the parameters of the dynamic threshold ( @xmath16 ) and optimize them in terms of quality of predictions .",
    "to do so , we assume that we have at our disposal voltage traces of the target neuron as well as firing times of presynaptic neurons .",
    "we also assume that the input characteristics are kept constant during the recording of the dataset used for the mapping procedure .",
    "we start by extraction of the spike shape @xmath35 .",
    "the shape of spikes is usually highly stereotyped and presents only little variability .",
    "we therefore select one spike train from the dataset and align all spikes relatively to some arbitrarily chosen initiation point .",
    "the mean trajectory of the spikes yields @xmath35 .",
    "detection and alignment of spikes is realized using a threshold condition on the first derivative of the membrane voltage .",
    "once we are done with @xmath35 , we extract the shape @xmath33 of an epsp and the shape @xmath34 of an ipsp .",
    "if we limit ourselves to the interval between two consecutive spikes of the same spike train @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ equ - srm ] ) with the notation introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ equ - srm - conv ] ) and ( [ equ - def - q - disc ] ) as follows ( for @xmath38 ) : @xmath39 it is then possible to find the optimal @xmath11-functions using the _ wiener - hopf optimal filtering technique _ @xcite .",
    "we fit the resulting epsp @xmath33 with a suitable function , typically a difference of exponentials : @xmath40 with a corresponding definition for @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are free parameters .",
    "the final step is to choose and optimize the threshold .",
    "the absolute refractory period @xmath18 is set to @xmath44ms .",
    "the other parameters of eq .",
    "( [ equ - threshold - def ] ) , i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are fitted in order to optimize the coincidence factor @xmath45 ( see below ) on a given spike train . in order to ensure a good generalization",
    ", we optimize the threshold with a large dataset generated with different input characteristics . the numerical optimization algorithm that we use",
    "is the _ downhill simplex method _ @xcite .",
    "obviously , the srm@xmath22 can only predict neuronal activity of the specific neuron it has been mapped to .      instead of real data from experiments ,",
    "we use as a reference or `` target '' a hodgkin - huxley - type model of a fast - spiking interneuron @xcite .",
    "it contains standard na@xmath46 and k@xmath46 spike - generating channels and one extra kv@xmath47 k@xmath46-channel derived from `` n''-type currents measured in human t - lymphocytes .",
    "this latter current produces a subtle form of adaptation .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "the hodgkin - huxley - type model of a fast - spiking interneuron is driven by random synaptic conductances generated by massive stochastic presynaptic spike arrival .",
    "the total driving current is given by @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the excitatory ( @xmath12 ) and inhibitory ( @xmath13 ) conductances and @xmath50 are the corresponding reversal potential .",
    "synaptic conductances are generated by slightly correlated homogeneous poisson spike trains .",
    "the excitatory and inhibitory populations contain respectively @xmath51 and @xmath52 neurons of which only a fraction @xmath53 ( respectively @xmath54 ) are independent .",
    "@xmath55 depend on the presynaptic discharge frequency , on the correlation coefficient and on the size of the presynaptic population . in the following , we assume that the presynaptic neurons discharge at frequencies @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the correlation coefficient is held at a constant value @xmath58 ( see appendix [ app - presyn - spikes ] for further details about how the presynaptic spike trains are generated and , in particular , see eqs .",
    "( [ equ - theory - corr-5 ] ) and ( [ equ - theory - corr-6 ] ) for the relation between @xmath55 and the correlation coefficient @xmath59 ) .",
    "the dynamics of each excitatory synapse @xmath5 is described by a conductance variable @xmath60 with : @xmath61 the value of @xmath60 is increased by an amount @xmath62 for each presynaptic spike activating the synapse at time @xmath63 .",
    "it then decays back to zero with a time constant @xmath64 .",
    "the total excitatory conductance is the sum of conductance variables @xmath60 over all excitatory synapses .",
    "thus , the total excitatory conductance is : @xmath65 with a corresponding definition for the total inhibitory conductance @xmath66 .",
    "numerical values used in this paper are summarized in table [ table - syn ] .",
    ".parameters of excitatory and inhibitory synapses ( adapted from destexhe and par @xcite ) .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig - comparative ] shows sample results of the predictive power of the srm@xmath69 in two distinct regimes , low - drive ( low presynaptic discharge frequencies , 1 ) and high - drive ( high presynaptic discharge frequencies , 2 ) . in both cases the predicted membrane voltage is reasonably close to the membrane voltage of the target neuron . note also that all the spikes in plotted samples are reproduced with the exact timing ( panel b ) .",
    "for these two cases , we find @xmath70 ( low - drive ) and @xmath71 ( high - drive ) .",
    "the coincidence factor @xmath45 takes a value of @xmath72 if @xmath73 of spikes coincide and is normalized to @xmath74 if coincidences are random ( see _ materials and methods _ section ) .    to test the performances in a more systematic way",
    ", we quantify the predictions of the srm@xmath69 in terms of the timing of the spikes ( coincidence factor @xmath45 ) and in terms of output frequencies of the model ( @xmath75 ) over a broad range of input characteristics ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "figure [ fig - gamma - f ] shows the performances of the srm@xmath69 for such a systematic procedure .",
    "we observe that the srm@xmath69 yields good performances ( @xmath76 and output frequency @xmath77 predicted in the correct range ) over a broad range of input discharge frequencies .",
    "the only notable exception is when inhibitory discharge frequency is very high . in this regime ,",
    "the output frequency @xmath75 is close to zero so that the number of spikes in a spike train is low .",
    "therefore , our coincidence factor @xmath45 is not well suited for this case .",
    "however , we note that even if @xmath45 is low , the output frequency is predicted in the correct range . furthermore , the subthreshold fluctuations of the membrane voltage are well reproduced ( not shown ) .",
    "interestingly , the srm@xmath69 yields good performances where it is supposed to do so but also where epsp - amplification takes place ( see figure [ fig - taueff ] ) .",
    "in the case of our target neuron , epsp - amplification occurs when both excitatory and inhibitory populations discharge at rather low frequencies .",
    "a fixed coefficient of correlation @xmath59 then imposes co - activation of large subpopulations of synapses in this regime ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ - theory - corr-5 ] ) ) .",
    "the target neuron therefore spends most of the time close from the resting potential and occasionally receives numerous coincident presynaptic spikes that bring it in the area of epsp - amplification .",
    "most of these large excursions then lead to a spike while only a few of them do not .",
    "in this situation , one can easily predict spikes at a correct timing with a threshold model like the srm@xmath69 .    in summary ,",
    "our modified version of the srm@xmath22 , the so - called srm@xmath69 , performs well over a broad range of input characteristics @xmath56 and @xmath57 and predicts not only the output frequency but also most of the spikes with the correct timing .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind that we used a calculation based on a conductance - driven integrate - and - fire model to evaluate the subthreshold membrane voltage fluctuations and the average membrane voltage .",
    "this latter results do not include the potential effect of ionic channels activated in the subthreshold regime .",
    "the srm@xmath69 should therefore fail in regimes where such ionic channels are activated . however , we found here that even though the underlying theoretical framework is on the edges of its validity domain , the srm@xmath69 still performs reasonably well in the regime where epsp - amplification takes place and thus as long as there are large enough fluctuations of the subthreshold membrane voltage .",
    "mapping real neurons to simplified neuronal models has benefited from many theoretical developments in recent years and applied to both _ in - vitro _ and _ in - vivo _",
    "recordings @xcite .",
    "however , most of the techniques have been developed for a current injection scenario @xcite .",
    "on the experimental side , conductance injection is increasingly used instead of current injection and is thought to be closer to _ in - vivo _ conditions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we had previously reported a mapping technique @xcite based on standard signal processing tools which allows a systematic mapping of a simplified neuron model , the spike response model @xcite , to intracellular recordings .",
    "it has been shown to yield very good results in the case of current injection for model neurons @xcite and with real data ( unpublished observations ) . however , while the reduced model built in this way generalizes its predictions over a broad range of different input characteristics for the current injection case , it performs very poorly in the conductance injection case for reasons reviewed above .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that a simple modification of the classic srm@xmath22 solves this problem . in its new formulation ,",
    "the model is able to predict very reliably many aspects of neuronal activity , such as timing of the spikes , membrane voltage and mean output rate .",
    "the global performances are improved and moreover , the model can generalize predictions extremely well . the new model srm@xmath69 is directly related to conductance - driven integrate - and - fire neurons @xcite .",
    "our technique can be applied to extract simple neuron models from experimental intracellular recordings under conductance injection .",
    "in this appendix , we detail the method used in simulations to generate slightly correlated spike trains and we also derive some useful analytical results .",
    "the method follows @xcite but there exists other ways to generate correlated spike trains ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "presynaptic spike trains are described by random homogeneous poisson processes . at each time step ,",
    "@xmath78 independent random variables are generated and distributed among the @xmath79 presynaptic neurons to generate slightly correlated spike trains @xcite . in this specific case",
