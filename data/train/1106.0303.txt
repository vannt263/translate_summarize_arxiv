    "shocks are ubiquitous in the universe and occur at various scales : from planetary shocks in our solar system to large scale shocks in clusters of galaxies .",
    "astrophysical shocks are rather different from shocks on earth , as typical mean - free - paths for particle - particle interactions in the interstellar medium are of the order of parsecs , which is larger than the scale of the shock transitions of interstellar shocks .",
    "the fact that we observe sharp transitions , implies that the existence of the shock must be communicated on scales shorter than this mean - free - path . from conservation of mass , momentum and energy over the shock front , and assuming an infinite mach number and no cosmic - ray acceleration , @xmath1 in which @xmath2 denotes the shock velocity , and @xmath3 the equation of state of the plasma ( @xmath4 for a non - relativistic gas ) .",
    "this equation holds for a plasma maximally out of thermal equilibrium , implying an electron temperature over proton temperature ( @xmath5 ) of the ratio of the electron and proton mass ( @xmath6 ) . for a plasma in thermal equilibrium , equation [ heat ]",
    "reads : @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the mean particle mass ( 0.6 for a fully ionized plasma with solar abundances ) .",
    "however , if a shock is accelerating cosmic rays , a cosmic - ray precursor will develop , which heats the incoming medium and lowers the effective mach number of the shock , in which case equation [ heat ] or [ equil ] are no longer valid ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in most empirical studies on temperature equilibration behind supernova remnant shocks , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined from balmer dominated shocks .",
    "these shocks are characterized by hydrogen line emission in the balmer series , leading to a line profile consisting of two superimposed lines .",
    "these shocks are non - radiative ; their energy losses in the form of radiation are dynamically negligible ( this happens for shock velocities @xmath11 200 kms@xmath12 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the hydrogen lines of these shocks are caused by impact excitation , not by recombination .",
    "the narrow component of the spectrum is emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms , excited shortly after entering the shock front ; its width reflects the temperature of the ambient medium .",
    "the broad component is emitted after charge exchange between incoming neutral hydrogen and hot protons behind the shock front .",
    "the width reflects the temperature of the protons behind the shock front . combining the width with the ratio of the flux in the narrow to the flux in the broad component",
    ", one can determine the shock velocity and hence the electron temperature ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "this procedure works for shocks which have negligible cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "if a shock is an efficient accelerator , the cosmic - ray precursor ionizes and heats the incoming medium and therewith increases the flux of the narrow component @xcite .",
    "the electron temperature for most young supernova remnants can also be measured from the x - ray spectrum , as the thermal component of the x - ray spectrum is shaped by the electron temperature .",
    "electron temperatures measured from x - ray spectra are generally not the electron temperatures right behind the shock front , but rather somewhat further to the inside of the shock , where temperatures have already ( partially ) equilibrated through coulomb interactions .",
    "the amount of equilibration is a function of @xmath13 : the ionization age , that can be determined from the x - ray spectrum simultaneously with the electron temperature , from the ratio of the fluxes in different spectral lines from the same species .",
    "@xcite studied shocks of the supernova remnant dem l71 at both optical and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the remnant has shock velocities between 555 and 980 kms@xmath12 .",
    "correcting for temperature equilibration effects , @xcite showed that @xmath5 decreases with increasing shock velocity .    from a theoretical point of view , it is not well determined how much electron - proton temperature equilibration would to expect behind a shock front .",
    "empirical studies of shocks with negligible cosmic - ray acceleration , show that electron and proton temperatures are equilibrated for slow shocks ( @xmath14 400 kms@xmath12 ) , whereas the degree of thermal equilibration decreases for faster shocks @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a relation of @xmath15 has been suggested for shocks with @xmath16 kms@xmath12   @xcite .",
    "this directly implies that @xmath9 is nearly constant closely behind the shock front ( i.e. apart from temperature equilibration effects , equation 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , independent of the shock velocity ( equation [ heat ] ) .",
    "the origin of this relation is attributed by @xcite to so - called lower hybrid waves ahead of the shock , caused by a ( moderate ) cosmic - ray precursor .",
    "note that @xcite could not reproduce @xmath15 , using published data of h@xmath17-spectra as well , but with different models for interpreting h@xmath17 spectra .",
    "@xcite and @xcite point out that for mach numbers @xmath18 the electrons ahead of the shock have a typical thermal velocity exceeding the shock velocity , which may lead , through non - resonant interactions with large - amplitude turbulent fluctuations in the shock transition region , to collisionless electron - heating and acceleration .",
    "interestingly , assuming a typical sound speed of the ambient medium of 10  km / s , @xmath19 corresponds to a shock speed of @xmath20  km / s . for a cosmic - ray accelerating shock",
    "it is even more complex , as the incoming material is already preheated by a cosmic - ray precursor , leading to a lower mach number at the main shock .",
    "this could mean that for cosmic - ray dominated shocks the electron - proton temperatures could be equilibrated again .    here",
    ", we investigate the electron - proton temperature equilibration behind several shock fronts of rcw  86 , using x - ray ( xmm - newton / mos ) and optical data .",
    "the shocks of the supernova remnant rcw  86 are particularly well suited for this study , as the ionization age of the plasma in parts of the remnant is low : @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this value is low compared to the ionization age of most other remnants .",
    "of @xmath22 . ]",
    "the low value for @xmath13 makes the measured electron temperature a more direct indication for the electron temperature at the shock front .",
    "additionally , the shocks of rcw  86 have a large variety in speeds , as the progenitor exploded in its own wind - blown bubble ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and parts of the remnant have already hit the dense rim of this bubble . as a result , the southwest ( sw ) rim has slowed down ; its x - ray emission is mostly thermal and the shock velocity is @xmath23 500  kms@xmath12  @xcite . the x - ray emission of the northeast ( ne ) shock is dominated by x - ray synchrotron emission @xcite , and its shock velocity is measured to be 6000 @xmath24 2800 kms@xmath12  @xcite . however , its proton temperature is low , which is an indication for efficient cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "furthermore , the mostly sub - solar abundances of the thermal x - ray emission at the shock front of rcw  86 indicate emission from shocked ambient medium ( rather than shocked ejecta , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tying the fitted parameters of the x - ray spectrum to the physics at the shock front .",
    "in this study , we use both published and new optical observations .",
    "the observation taken from the sw of the remnant was previously published in @xcite and the observation from the ne rim was published in @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the north ( n ) and east ( e ) observations are taken from @xcite and the northwest ( nw ) location from @xcite .",
    "the exact locations of the n and e spectra have been kindly provided to us by parviz ghavamian ( private communication ) .",
    "we also use parameters of a spectrum published in @xcite , this spectrum is taken from the northern region as well .",
    "table 2 summarizes the line widths used in the present paper .",
    "the optical image of fig . [ sw_vlt ] has been obtained with vlt / fors2 as pre - image for the spectral observation , both in 2007 ( programme i d 079.d-0735 ) .",
    "the image is a combination of three exposures of 200s , through a narrowband h@xmath17 filter ( ` h_alpha+83 ` ) .",
    "to correct for stellar light , three similar images through a narrowband h@xmath17 filter , shifted 4500 kms@xmath12  ( ` h_alpha/4500 + 61 ` ) have been taken .",

    "this setup resulted in a spectral resolution of 350 kms@xmath12 , which is sufficient for resolving the broad component , however , the narrow component of the line probably remains unresolved .",

    "this statistic is more appropriate than the classical @xmath42-method for fitting spectra which contain bins with few counts @xcite . for more counts , this statistic asymptotically approaches the @xmath42-statistic .",
    "for most of the spectra , this method was relatively straightforward .",
    "some regions needed some special attention , as described below .",
    "the ne spectrum needed an additional power - law component , to account for the synchrotron emission present in the spectrum @xcite . including the power law to account for the synchrotron emission results in an unconstrained electron temperature , with a nominal electron temperature of 37 kev .",
    "however , the continuum emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation and the temperature is therefore mostly determined by the very weak line emission .",
    "@xcite encountered similar problems but concentrated on a slightly different extraction region , which had more thermal emission .",
    "they reported @xmath43 kev .",
    "the high , but unconstrained electron temperature we found for this study , and the high value reported by @xcite suggest that the electron and proton temperature are likely close to equilibration .",

    "we carried out a different approach carried out by constructing a second nei component , consisting of pure metals .",
    "we constructed this component by increasing the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s and fe with a factor of 10@xmath45 , mimicking a pure metal plasma ( a similar procedure was adopted for the 0519 - 69.0 remnant in the lmc , * ? ? ?",
