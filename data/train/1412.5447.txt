    "the problem of formation of a cylindrical beam of charged particles with a predefined cross - section arises in development of devices such as multi - aperture particle sources for plasma heating and diagnostics @xcite .",
    "such devices compose a cylindrical cutting with a required cross - section from one - dimensional flow of charged particle produced in a planar diode .",
    "the particles flow in an idealized endless planar diode is intrinsically rectilinear .",
    "it is characterized by zero angular divergence and zero emittance , which means that the particles trajectories do not intersect .",
    "cutting a piece of the flow gives rise to lateral electric field that increases the angular spread of the particles .",
    "in many cases , the angular spread should be avoided . according to j.r .",
    "pierce @xcite , the transversal field can be compensated in the entire beam interior by proper shaping of the external electrodes . from the point of view of pure mathematics , the synthesis of such ( pierce ) electrodes belongs to a class of ill - posed cauchy s problems for the laplace equation @xcite .",
    "it assumes a computation of the electrostatic potential outside of the beam that provides the required compensation of the transversal electric field .    for a particle beam in the form of endless belt , the pierce problem is two - dimensional .",
    "it was solved by pierce himself .",
    "he noted that required solution is given by an analytic continuation of the child - langmuir potential @xmath0 @xcite , which describes 1d electric field inside a space - charge - limited endless diode . for a cylindrical beam with an arbitrary cross - section ,",
    "the pierce problem becomes three - dimensional and the method of analytical continuation fails .",
    "a general solution of the pierce problem in 3d case was found by v.a .",
    "syrovoi @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "his algorithm involves elimination of the dependence of the potential on coordinate @xmath1 along the beam by means of the laplace transform , two analytical continuations , application of the riemann method to solve an intermediate 2d problem , and an inverse integral transform using the lipschitz",
    " hankel integral .    in this note , we apply a slightly modified method of syrovoi to a beam of charged particles with a cross - section , close to a polygon ; in particular , we present an exact solution of the pierce problem near the right angle of such a beam .",
    "this solution is then extended to the case of an arbitrary angle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we formulate a formal solution of the 3d pierce problem for a rectilinear beam of charged particles . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we compute electric potential outside of the beam near the right angle of the beam cross - section . in section [ s4 ]",
    "this solution is generalized to an arbitrary angle .",
    "finally , in section  [ s8 ] we summarize our results .",
    "to begin with , we first formulate the pierce problem for a cylindrical beam with an arbitrary cross - section .",
    "our goal is to find a solution of the laplace equation @xmath2 outside of a cylindrical domain assuming the cauchy boundary conditions @xmath3 on the side boundary of the cylinder , which is given in a parametric form as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a formal parameter , and @xmath6 denotes a derivative , normal to the boundary .",
    "the boundary conditions specify the cauchy problem for the laplace equation @xcite .",
    "unlike neumann and dirichlet problems for elliptic equations ( see , eg , @xcite ) , it belongs to a class of ill - posed problems of mathematical physics .",
    "as the hadamard example shows @xcite , a solution to the cauchy problem for the laplace equation is unique , but unstable with respect to small perturbations of the boundary conditions .    from the point of view of physics , the space charge of a beam , bounded in transverse directions",
    ", inevitably creates a lateral electric field that increases angular divergence of the flux ( ie , the emittance of the beam ) .",
    "the lateral field can be compensated in the entire beam interior by a careful shaping of additional electrodes placed outside of the beam .",
    "pierce @xcite found the shape of such electrodes in 2d problem by means of analytic continuation of the 1d solution @xmath0 to the complex plane @xmath7 .",
    "pierce s solution @xmath8 refers to the case of a beam that occupies a half - space @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the shape of the electrode with zero potential is determined from the equation @xmath10 it has the shape of a plane , which forms an angle @xmath11 with the plane of the beam boundary .",
    "exact solutions for the beams with circular and elliptical cross - sections were found in refs .",
    "finally , v.a .",
    "syrovoi found a general solution of the pierce problem for a cylindrical beam with a cross - section of arbitrary shape @xcite .",
    "however , his work remains unappreciated , and other authors rarely refer to it . perhaps , this is due to the complexity of syrovoi s solution .",
    "it includes double analytic continuation , and a final expression involves integration of the hypergeometric function whose argument involves analytic continuation of the functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 in a nontrivial way . in addition , syrovoi has not presented a clear evidence that the pierce solution can be obtained from his formulas .",
    "equivalence of syrovoi s solutions for the beams with circular and elliptical cross - sections @xcite to solutions of other authors @xcite is not also verified .    in this paper",
    ", we use the method of syrovoi to find the electric potential near one individual right corner of the rectangle , assuming that the beam occupies a quarter of the space , namely @xmath14 in this case , a conformal mapping of the exterior of the beam on the complex half - plane is made by a power function , which greatly simplifies the calculations .",
