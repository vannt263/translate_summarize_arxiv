    "the electromagnetic interaction in the form of real photon absorption and ( inelastic ) electron scattering is one of the major experimental tools to study the excitation spectrum of the nucleon .",
    "it consists of three main components : non - resonant ( multi- ) meson production near the respective thresholds , excitation of baryon resonances ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 etc . ) with definite quantum numbers and the parton ( quark and gluon ) distributions as revealed in deep inelastic lepton scattering .",
    "unitarity ( the optical theorem ) and forward dispersion relations connect integrals over the whole nucleon excitation spectrum to certain low energy parameters .",
    "prominent examples are baldin s sum rule @xcite and the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule @xcite . in the first case",
    "the sum of the nucleon electric and magnetic polarizability @xmath0 is equated to the integral over the real photon absorption cross section @xmath15 weighted by the inverse squared photon lab energy @xmath16 , @xmath17 here , @xmath18 mev is the pion photoproduction threshold , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the pion and nucleon mass , respectively .",
    "the resulting value for the proton @xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite ( recently reevaluated @xcite with improved photoproduction data to be @xmath23 @xmath22 ) is often used in the analysis of low energy proton compton scattering in order to facilitate the difficult separation of the electric polarizability @xmath24 and magnetic polarizability @xmath25 of the proton . on the theoretical side chiral",
    "perturbation theory permits systematic calculations of this quantity @xcite . at leading order in the quark mass ( or , equivalently , the pion mass ) expansion",
    "one finds @xmath26 @xmath22 , a number which is in almost perfect agreement with the empirical determination .",
    "however this result does not include the strong paramagnetic effects from the @xmath3-resonance .",
    "a next - to - leading order calculation leads to @xmath27 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "at this order one can indeed establish ( for the proton ) the important cancelation between diamagnetic pion - loop effects ( @xmath28 ) and paramagnetic effects from the @xmath3-resonance . the theoretical uncertainty ( @xmath29 ) results from some not very well known low energy parameters entering the calculation and from estimates of the @xmath3-contribution itself .    the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule @xcite connects the squared ( proton or neutron ) anomalous magnetic moment @xmath30 to an integral over the difference of the helicity @xmath31 and @xmath32 photoabsorption cross sections @xmath33 weighted by the inverse photon lab energy @xmath16 , @xmath34 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] at present",

    "finds a qualitative agreement at the 2030% level between the left and right hand side of eq.(2 ) , but there remains a notorious mismatch in sign once one considers the proton - neutron difference .",
    "upcoming experiments at mainz ( mami ) and bonn ( elsa ) are devoted to measuring precisely these helicity photoabsorption cross sections @xmath35 and these measurements will help to clear up the situation concerning the proton - neutron difference and the validity of the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule itself .    from a purely theoretical point of view",
    "the drell - hearn - gerasimov sum rule stands or falls with the validity of the no - subtraction hypothesis , since the other ingredients in its derivation , the optical theorem and the compton low energy theorem , are beyond any doubt .",
    "stated differently the drell - hearn - gerasimov sum rule hinges essentially on the high energy ( @xmath36 ) behavior of the ( spin - flip ) forward compton amplitude .",
    "on much safer ground is the sum rule for the so - called spin - polarizability @xmath1 since it does not require the no - subtraction hypothesis .",
    "the nucleon spin polarizability @xmath1 is the integral over the difference of the helicity @xmath31 and @xmath32 photoabsorption cross sections weighted by the inverse third power of the photon lab energy @xmath16 , @xmath37\\,\\,.\\ ] ] semi - empirical determinations using the pion photoproduction multipoles give @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the calculation presented in ref.@xcite allows to understand these values in terms of compensative effects from relativistic pion - loops and the @xmath3-resonance , @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath39 , and @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath39 . obviously the @xmath3-effect is dominant in both cases , but the relativistic pion - loop effects are also important in order to reproduce the difference between the proton and neutron value of @xmath1 .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the calculation of @xmath45 in ref.@xcite is not a complete and systematic order - by - order calculation , but it seems rather convincing that the relativistic pion - loops and the @xmath3-resonance account well for the low energy dynamics encoded in @xmath45 as well as in @xmath46 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to generalize the baldin sum rule for @xmath0 and the sum rule for @xmath1 to virtual photons with @xmath2 in the form of energy - weighted integrals over measurable electroproduction cross sections .",
    "we will present theoretical predictions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 by evaluating the contributions from the relativistic pion - loop and the @xmath3-resonance as done in ref.@xcite . in the case of",
    "@xmath4 we can compare with an ( approximate ) empirical determination using as input electroproduction data from desy @xcite . in the high-@xmath49 regime",
    "the generalized polarizability sum rules are given by integrals over the ( partonic ) structure functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 times a characteristic power of @xmath52 .",
    "we investigate furthermore whether the low energy hadronic side ( given in terms pion - loops and the @xmath3-resonance ) extrapolated upward and the partonic side extrapolated downward match at some intermediate scale .",
    "we find that this is indeed the case at @xmath53 gev@xmath6 .",
    "this means that the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not very sensitive to the details of the nucleon excitation spectrum .",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the necessary formalism , the transverse virtual forward compton amplitude , the optical theorem and the definition of the generalized polarizability sum rules for @xmath54 and @xmath55 in terms of electroproduction cross sections . in section 3",
    "we discuss our results for the proton and the neutron .",
    "section 4 ends with a summary .",
    "the appendix includes explicit formulas for the respective virtual forward compton amplitudes as they derive from the relativistic one - pion loop graphs of chiral perturbation and @xmath3-excitation tree diagrams .",
    "in this section we present the formalism for transverse virtual forward compton scattering off the nucleon . the more familiar case of real photon forward compton scattering",
    "can be easily recovered by simply setting @xmath12 and will therefore not be treated here separately .",
    "we consider virtual photons with @xmath56 .",
    "the forward transverse amplitude for the process @xmath57 reads @xmath58 with @xmath59 the generalizations of the spin non - flip and spin - flip forward compton amplitudes , respectively . crossing symmetry implies that these are even functions of @xmath16 .",

    "has @xmath65 .",
    "the born contributions to @xmath59 come from the direct and crossed nucleon pole diagram with only a nucleon in the intermediate state .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction the combination of a ( once - subtracted ) forward dispersion relation and the optical theorem leads to the sum rules for the sum of electric and magnetic polarizability @xmath81 ( baldin s sum rule ) , and for the so - called spin - polarizability @xmath1 .",

    "these are the dominant processes at low energies where the energy - weighted sum rules eqs.(9,10 ) for @xmath54 and @xmath55 are almost saturated .",
    "the explicit formulas for the various contributions to @xmath71 are given in the appendix .",
    "at large energies and momentum transfer the nucleon structure functions show a scaling behavior , i.e. they depend only on the dimensionless bjorken variable @xmath86 . for such kinematics",
    "one has @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with the unpolarized and polarized nucleon structure functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the scaling limit .",
    "the contribution of the second spin - dependent structure function @xmath89 is suppressed by a prefactor @xmath90 . as a consequence of the scaling relations",
    "one finds that the large-@xmath49 behavior of the generalized polarizabilities @xmath54 and @xmath55 is given by certain integrals over the nucleon structure functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the scaling limit times a power of @xmath52 , @xmath91 the relevant integrals on the right hand side can be evaluated with existing parametrizations @xcite of the structure functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the predictions of our approach valid for small @xmath49 , which explicitly treats relativistic pion - loops and the @xmath3-excitation , matches the qcd - asymptotics valid for large @xmath49 at some intermediate scale @xmath49 .",
    "in this section we present and discuss our results for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the formulas for relativistic pion - loop contributions ( given in the appendix ) depend on the @xmath92-coupling constant @xmath93 for which we use @xmath94 .",
    "the evaluation of the relativistic @xmath14-excitation graphs requires more information .",
    "first there is the @xmath95 transition strength @xmath96 for which we use the large-@xmath97 relation to the isovector nucleon magnetic moment , @xmath98 .",
    "second , there is the rarita - schwinger off - shell parameter @xmath99 with the empirical band @xmath100 @xcite , for which we choose @xmath101 .",
    "this value is essentially fixed from the @xmath3-contribution to @xmath102 ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "third , the @xmath103-transition occurs at non - zero @xmath49 and thus there is also a transition form factor @xmath104 .",
    "we use @xmath105 as extracted from pion electroproduction in the @xmath3-resonance region in ref.@xcite .",
    "apart from the exponential function in the numerator , @xmath104 is the usual dipole fit to the proton electric form factor .",
    "we start the discussion with the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the real photon point @xmath12 . with the parameter input mentioned before we get @xmath106 @xmath107 where the first number in the bracket comes from the pion - loops and the second one from the @xmath14-excitation .",
    "the latter is given by the expression @xmath108   \\,\\,,\\ ] ] and its theoretical value @xmath109 @xmath22 for @xmath101 is about 20% larger than the quasi - empirical value @xmath110 @xmath22 obtained in ref.@xcite . note that the sum of relativistic pion - loops and the @xmath14-excitation with @xmath101 reproduces very well the empirical value for the proton , @xmath111 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "however , the same diagrams overestimate the empirical value for the neutron , @xmath112 @xmath113 @xcite by about 20% .",
    "a similar problem was also encountered in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "it originates from the fact that due to certain numerical coefficients @xcite the diamagnetic effects from the pion - loops at next - to - leading order ( @xmath28 ) are less strong for the neutron than for the proton .",
    "there is no need to reiterate the values for @xmath114 given in the introduction and in ref.@xcite , since @xmath114 does not depend on the off - shell parameter @xmath99 .",
    "this feature holds even for the full @xmath49-dependent @xmath48 .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath99-dependent term in @xmath115 ( see appendix ) is just a quadratic polynomial in @xmath85 , which makes zero contribution to @xmath116 according to eq.(12 ) .",
    "this independence of the off - shell parameter @xmath99 is of course a very welcome feature .",
    "next , we come to the @xmath49-dependent quantities @xmath47 as calculated in our approach .",
    "they are shown in fig.1 for the proton and the neutron in the region @xmath117 gev@xmath6 .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines give the relativistic pion - loop and @xmath3-contribution , respectively .",
    "the full lines correspond to the sum of both contributions . in fig.2",
    "we show the result of our calculation ( full line ) together with an evaluation of the sum rule eq.(9 ) using as input for @xmath118 the parametrized electroproduction data of ref.@xcite ( dashed line ) . since no transverse - longitudinal separation was done for these electroproduction data one should assign at least a @xmath119 error band to the dashed line in fig.2 .",
    "note also that the dashed curve obtained from integrating the unpolarized electroproduction data of ref.@xcite does not exactly extrapolate the value @xmath120 @xmath22 at the real photon point @xmath121 . within the uncertainty of the empirical @xmath4 ( obtained from integrating the electroproduction data )",
    "there is good agreement with our calculation .",
    "note that the @xmath49-dependence of the pion - loops is entirely due to the pion and nucleon propagators in the loop - diagrams , and the @xmath49-dependence of the @xmath3-contribution is essentially due to the phenomenological @xmath122 transition form factor @xmath104 given in eq.(15 ) . in fig.3",
    "we show the results for @xmath47 of our calculation ( full lines ) together with the partonic prediction eq.(13 ) extrapolated downward to @xmath123 gev@xmath6 .",

    "fig.4 shows the @xmath49-dependent spin - polarizabilities @xmath48 for the proton and the neutron in the region @xmath128 gev@xmath6 .",
    "for these quantities a strong cancelation between ( positive ) pion - loop contributions and ( negative ) @xmath3-contributions is taking place .",
    "for very small @xmath49 the @xmath3-effects are actually dominant as witnessed by the negative values at the real photon point @xmath12 . note that the @xmath3-contribution decreases faster in magnitude ( due to the transition form factor @xmath104 ) than the pion - loop contribution . as a consequence",
    "@xmath48 pass through zero around @xmath129 gev@xmath6 .",
    "at present there are not enough data for the helicity cross sections @xmath130 such that one could integrate them up to get an empirical determination of @xmath48 .",
    "however these will be measured in the near future at the electron accelerator laboratories mami , elsa and tjnaf . in particular",
    "one can then test our result for the transition through zero of @xmath48 at @xmath131 gev@xmath6 .",
    "of course , the one - loop chiral perturbation theory treatment of the pion - cloud contribution is likely to become uncertain at @xmath132 gev@xmath6 .",
    "effects beyond one - loop , such as form factors of the interacting @xmath133 system , can make these contributions softer so that the zero of @xmath48 may be shifted to somewhat smaller values of @xmath49 .    finally , we show in fig.5 the results of our calculation for @xmath116 ( full lines ) together with the partonic prediction ( dashed lines ) extrapolated downward .",
    "the integrals @xmath134 were evaluated with the parton distributions of ref.@xcite taken at @xmath125 gev@xmath6 .",
    "the resulting values for these integrals are @xmath135 for the proton and @xmath136 for the neutron .",
    "again one observes a smooth transition from the hadronic side ( pion - loops plus @xmath3 ) to the partonic side around @xmath137 gev@xmath6 in the case of the proton .",
    "the partonic prediction for @xmath11 is very small and negative , whereas the sum of pion - loop and @xmath3-contributions is positive in the low-@xmath49 region .",
    "there is an almost complete cancelation of the pion - loop and @xmath3-contributions at @xmath123 gev@xmath6 , and this zero would move upward with a slight change of the transition form factor @xmath104 . within the accuracy of our approach",
    "one can say that there is no mismatch for the neutron s @xmath11 between the hadronic prediction at low @xmath49 and the partonic prediction extrapolated downward .",
    "in this work we have generalized the sum rules for the nucleon electric plus magnetic polarizabilities , @xmath138 , and the so - called spin - polarizability @xmath1 to virtual photons with @xmath2 .",
    "once the respective unpolarized and polarized nucleon electroproduction cross sections @xmath118 and @xmath130 are measured these sum rules can be evaluated empirically .",

    "the spin polarizabilities @xmath48 pass through zero ( starting from negative values ) at @xmath141 gev@xmath6 as a result of the cancelation between pion - loop and @xmath3-effects .",
