    "the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and the mechanically controllable break - junction ( mcb ) techniques offer an opportunity to study the conductance of metallic contacts consisting of only a few atoms ( quantum contacts ) .",
    "the electrical conductance of such contacts , at small bias voltage is proportional to the number of propagating electron modes , @xmath1 , each one contributing an amount of @xmath2@xcite . with increasing the diameter of the contact the energies of modes continuously decreases , but the number of modes increases whenever a new mode fits into the constriction cross section .",
    "this number , @xmath3 is limited by the requirement that the kinetic energy for the transverse motion is smaller than the fermi energy @xmath4 .",
    "when a new mode is occupied , a new quantum channel is opened .",
    "the conductance then undergoes a jump of @xmath5 .",
    "such quantization of conductance has been observed in both two and three dimensional contacts with diameters comparable to fermi wave - length @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the fermi momentum ) @xcite .",
    "jumps in conductance are also expected to occur , at the constant contact diameter while bias voltage is varied .",
    "if the bias @xmath8 is larger than the distances between the energy levels of quantum modes , it is possible to change the number of opened modes by changing the voltage @xmath9 at a certain threshold voltage a channel is opened or closed for one direction of the electron wave vector along the constriction and consequently conductance suffers a @xmath10 stepwise change @xcite .",
    "quantum interference effects have been studied in different mesoscopic systems @xcite . in ballistic metallic microconstrictions",
    "it manifests itself as fluctuations in conductance when a magnetic field @xcite or an electrical voltage is applied @xcite . now experimental efforts have been done using mcb techniques , in order to measure conductance as a function of voltage in atomic - size point contacts @xcite . a prominent feature of these measurements , is the existence of small random voltage - dependent fluctuations in conductance , far from steps .",
    "the measurements @xcite clearly indicate suppression of the fluctuations for conductance values near the integer multiples of the conductance quantum .",
    "similar results have been reported by using a stm to show the strong voltage dependence of conductance of one - atom contacts at different temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the observed oscillations in conductance are due to the quantum interference effects @xcite .",
    "ludoph and co - authors @xcite , propose the following interpretation : the electron wave transmitted through the contact is backscattered to the contact by an impurity and then partially reflected at the contact .",
    "these waves interfere and change the total conductivity .",
    "the energy and thus the wave number of an injected electron into the channel , depends on the voltage .",
    "consequently the interference pattern in conductance oscillates as electron wave number varies with the voltage .    although the theory developed by ludoph et al .",
    "@xcite can explain the general feature of fluctuations but here we try to examine a different mechanism .",
    "impurities ( or defects ) are assumed to be located inside the constriction , and the interference is effectively between waves scattered from the impurities .",
    "the existence of a few defects or impurities inside the constriction is rather natural considering the way the contact is formed . using the model of a long microconstriction",
    "we can find the conductivity analytically .",
    "we discuss the theory of nonlinear electron transport through a mesoscopic microconstriction with a few impurities .",
    "we show that the nonlinear dependence of the quantum conductance on the voltage is obtained from this model .",
    "the form of this dependence is affected not only by the distances between impurities , but also by their positions inside the constriction .    in sec .",
    "ii the model hamiltonian is discussed and is used to obtain a general expression for the nonlinear conductance . in sec .",
    "iii a @xmath11-function potential is assumed for the interaction of electrons with impurities and a simplified equation for the conductance is obtained . within the framework of perturbation theory , a general analytical equation is also derived for conductance of the system , for arbitrary number of quantum modes and arbitrary number of impurities located in arbitrary positions .",
    "these analytical results are illustrated by numerical calculations for the contact in the form of a long cylindrical contact.a brief discussion of result is given in sec .",
    "let us consider a long narrow constriction , which connects two bulk metals , assuming @xmath12 .",
    "the geometry is shown in fig .",
    "we assume that the contact shape is smooth on the scale of the wavelength @xmath13 this condition assures that different transverse modes pass through the ballistic contact independently ( adiabatic approximation @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume that the contact length is much larger than its diameter and we can neglect the constriction end effects . under these approximations ,",
    "the electrical field inside the contact far from the ends is negligible and the energy @xmath14 of ballistic electrons depends only on the sign of velocity along the contact axis @xcite .",
