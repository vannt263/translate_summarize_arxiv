    "@xcite concluded that the measured mass and radius of gj 1214b is most consistent with an interior that is water - dominated , with a hydrogen - helium envelope that is 0.05% the mass of the planet .",
    "@xcite modeled the planet s interior structure , and concluded that if water were present in the planet s atmosphere , it would be a supercritical fluid .",
    "hence , gj 1214b should not have a solid surface .",
    "@xcite also modeled the interior of gj 1214b assuming a two - layer ( homogeneous envelope overlying a rock core ) structure , and found their results favor a composition similar to that of @xcite .",

    "they found that if the planet s atmosphere were @xmath5-dominated , the primary transit depth would show larger variations with wavelength than if the planet had an @xmath4- or @xmath1-dominated atmosphere ; this is because of the larger atmospheric scale height for an @xmath0-dominated atmosphere as compared to a high - mmw atmosphere .",
    "this would lead to enhanced spectral features that should be detectable by current ground- and space - based instrumentation .",

    "the mitgcm solves the primitive equations , a simplification of the navier - stokes equations assuming local hydrostatic balance , which is valid in stably stratified atmospheres with horizontal length scales greatly exceeding vertical length scales .",

    "second , the depth of the high - latitude jets decrease with increasing metallicity ; jets in the solar case extend to pressures of approximately 1 bar , while the jets in higher metallicity cases extend to only @xmath33300 mbar .",
    "similar trends are seen in circulation models of hot neptune gj 436b ( lewis et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the trends in circulation are a result of enhanced opacity associated with higher metallicities , which leads to shallower heating in the atmosphere ( fortney et al .",

    "however , at a given pressure , this day - night temperature difference is greater for higher metallicities .",
    "we compare the temperature variations as a function of pressure in figures 3 and [ daynight_diff ] .",
    "figure 3 plots the wind and temperature profiles for each atmospheric metallicity at three pressure levels : 1 mbar , 30 mbar , and 1 bar , which approximately bracket the range of pressures over which infrared photons escape to space ( figure 3 ) .",
    "indeed , at the shallowest pressure , 1 mbar , the 50@xmath2 solar model exhibits the highest day - night temperature variations . at 30 mbar , day - night temperature differences are small , but the 50@xmath2 solar case nevertheless exhibits the largest temperature variation from equator to pole . at 1 bar ,",
    "only the 1@xmath2 solar case exhibits significant temperature variation , as stellar energy is deposited deeper at low metallicity .",
    "these trends are illustrated further in figure [ daynight_diff ] , which plots the maximum dayside - nightside temperature difference at each pressure level for each atmospheric composition .",

    "if the atmosphere is @xmath8-dominated ( figure [ highmmw_plots ] , top row ) , the atmosphere still possesses an equatorial superrotating jet , with peak speeds of @xmath34 , and high - latitude jets with speeds exceeding 500 @xmath30 .",
    "for a @xmath1-dominated atmosphere , however , equatorial superrotation is much weaker ; instead , the dynamics are dominated by high - latitude jets , with peak speeds exceeding 500 @xmath30 ( figure [ highmmw_plots ] , bottom row ) .",
    "the @xmath15 , @xmath16 case , as expected , exhibits an intermediate behavior , whereby the atmosphere is dominated by broad , high - latitude jets and moderate equatorial superrotation ( figure [ highmmw_plots ] , middle row ) .",

    "the changes in dynamical and temperature regimes between low- and high - mmw atmospheres and between water- and @xmath1-dominated atmospheres can be attributed to differences in the vertical opacity structure and hence heating budget . for a @xmath1-dominated atmosphere ,",
    "the atmosphere is more transparent to visible radiation .",
    "hence , the stellar energy is deposited deeper in the atmosphere as compared to hydrogen- and water - dominated atmospheres .",
    "the qualitative picture can be further confirmed by plotting the heating / cooling rates and visible and ir fluxes on the dayside and nightside ( figure [ flux_plots ] ) .",
    "the top left panel shows the dayside net visible flux , which has a net downward direction .",
    "the water case absorbs the incoming stellar energy much higher in the atmosphere as compared to the solar and @xmath1 cases , which corresponds to a much larger specific heating rate at the top of the atmosphere where the atmospheric mass is much less ( top right panel ) .",
    "note also that the heating and cooling rates are smallest for the @xmath1-dominated case , helping to explain the weak superrotation .",
    "the large variation in visible flux with height for the water - dominated case leads to a large specific heating rate at low pressures , where the atmospheric mass is less .",
    "the bottom two panels plot the net ir flux at the substellar and antistellar points , respectively .",

    "overall , the plots show that the @xmath1-dominated case absorbs energy deepest , and the water - dominated case highest .    based on the results presented in @xcite",
    ", one would expect that the 1@xmath2 solar case , which has the strongest superrotation , should absorb visible flux at lower pressures compared to the other two compositions , where day - night temperature variations and forcing are largest .",
    "however , as described above , the water - dominated case has the shallowest flux deposition .",
    "this suggests that the differences in specific heat ( and therefore scale height ) might also play a role in the differences in energy budget and dynamical regimes . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we ran two models , the first with 1@xmath2 solar atmospheric opacities but a specific heat , mean - molecular weight , and scale height set to the @xmath1-dominated value , and a second model which has the reverse ( @xmath1-dominated atmospheric opacities , 1@xmath2 solar specific heat , mmw and scale height ) .",
    "the 1@xmath2 solar opacity case does show flow features similar to that of the @xmath1-dominated case in figure [ highmmw_plots ] , with high latitude jets and weak superrotation at the equator .",
    "a detailed analysis of these differences , specifically for the @xmath1-dominated case , will be a task for future studies .",
    "we can compare our results to the other circulation models of gj 1214b , particularly menou ( 2012 ) , which models three of the atmospheric compositions included in this paper ( water - dominated , 1@xmath2 and 30@xmath2 solar ) , though with a different circulation model ( the intermediate general circulation model ) , radiative transfer scheme ( double - grey ) , and model setup . in comparing the hydrogen - dominated models ( see figure 2 in menou 2012 ) , one can see broad agreement , with equatorial superrotation in the 1 - 2 @xmath32 range , and high - latitude eastward winds .",
    "however , the jet structure is different  the equatorial jets in menou ( 2012 ) extend to deeper pressures than our models .",

    "furthermore , both menou ( 2012 ) and our results include eastward winds at high latitudes , while zalucha et al .",
    "has westward winds at the same latitudes .",
    "these differences are most likely due to differences in the bottom boundary and radiative heating schemes .",
    "while we already include opacity effects due to pressure - induced absorption ( pia ) from @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath36 collisions ( see kataria et al .",
    "2013 ) , here we test the importance of including opacity effects due to pia from @xmath1-@xmath1 collisions .",
    "figure [ taus ] compares the optical depth , @xmath37 , of this opacity source with the optical depths for a pure water and pure @xmath1 atmosphere .",

    "this can be further simplified using the ideal gas law as @xmath44 . here",
    "we calculate the optical depths for each composition in each wavelength interval at a temperature of 725 k and a pressure of 1 bar ( @xmath45 cgs ) .    as shown in figure [ taus ] , the @xmath1-@xmath1 pia is most important in the longest wavelength ( shortest wavenumber ) frequency bin ( denoted by grey dotted lines ) . only a small fraction of the planet s flux is emitted in this wavelength range , and therefore we expect that the inclusion of @xmath1-@xmath1 pia should not significantly affect the dynamical structure .",

    "there are minor differences between both cases ; the westward flow at the top of the atmosphere extends to deeper pressures at the equator when pia is included , and the pia case exhibits a slightly different flow pattern at @xmath3330 mbar .",
    "however , the bulk features remain the same : the speeds and horizontal / vertical extent of the high latitude jets , and the temperature and shape of the hottest regions on the dayside do not differ significantly . therefore , while it is important to include this opacity source , it does not dramatically change the dynamical and thermal structure of the atmosphere .",
    "using the outputs from our model integrations , we can generate lightcurves and spectra of gj 1214b for each atmospheric composition .",
    "most ground- and space - based observations of gj 1214b have been obtained during transit , but their flat transmission spectra suggest the presence of clouds that prevent easy characterization of the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , only dayside emergent flux spectra obtained at secondary eclipse and lightcurves will be able to constrain the planet s atmospheric composition .",
    "observations with the _ spitzer space telescope _ were able to detect secondary eclipse ( fraine et al .",

    ", observers may use these theoretical lightcurves and spectra to select the wavelengths that best suit their efforts .",
    "we choose to focus on atmospheric compositions of 50@xmath2 solar and 99% @xmath8/1% @xmath1 ( water - dominated ) , as these two models best illustrate the differences in emergent flux spectra and lightcurves that arise from differences in circulation and temperature structures .",
    "as discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2 , at each pressure level the water - dominated case has a greater temperature difference from dayside to nightside than the 50@xmath2 solar case .",
    "therefore , we expect the water - dominated case to exhibit larger flux variations with orbital phase as compared to the 50@xmath2 solar case ( figure [ daynight_diff ] ) .",
    "however , this will vary widely as a function of wavelength , as the water spectrum is dominated by fundamental and combination vibrational bands in the near - infrared ( ir ) and mid - ir . within these water bands ,",
    "the atmosphere is opaque , and hence observations at these wavelengths will probe lower pressures .",
    "thus , according to figure [ daynight_diff ] , we would expect greater day - night temperature variations and larger flux variation with orbital phase . at wavelengths outside of the water bands ( i.e. , in spectral windows ) observations sense deeper , hotter regions of the atmosphere where day - night temperature variations are smaller",
    "; hence , there should be less flux variation with orbital phase .",

    "the large day - night temperature variations lead to large flux variations with orbital phase . outside of the bands ( inside the spectral windows ) , we probe deeper pressures where there are small temperature differences and hence small phase variations . comparing the emergent flux spectra of the 50@xmath2 solar composition",
    ", we see the absorption features are not as deep and less dominated by water features .",
    "the difference between windows and non - windows is also less prominent .",
    "however , the 50@xmath2 solar case also exhibits variations in emergent flux with phase and wavelength , indicating that for both cases , different atmospheric pressure levels are probed at different wavelengths .",
    "this can be quantitatively shown by plotting the pressure probed in emergent flux , where the optical depth , @xmath37 , is equal to one .",
    "we calculate the @xmath47 level by first determining the brightness temperature , @xmath48 , as a function of wavelength , and finding the pressure level at which the globally - averaged temperature is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ tau1 ] with a colorscale corresponding to the maximum temperature variation at each pressure level from figure [ daynight_diff ] . for both atmospheric compositions ,",
    "the wavelength regions with small ( large ) phase variations correspond to deeper ( shallower ) pressures , where day - night temperature variations are smaller ( larger ) .",
    "lightcurves of each composition further illustrate the differences between low- and high - mmw compositions .",
    "we plot the planet / star flux ratio as a function orbital phase for the water- and 50@xmath2 solar compositions in figure [ lightcurves ] . in each case , an orbital phase of 0.0 corresponds to transit , while an orbital phase of 0.5 corresponds to secondary eclipse .",
    "six lightcurves are plotted at the general wavelength bands @xmath49 listed in table [ wl_bands ] and denoted in figures [ spectra ] and [ tau1 ] . for the water - dominated case ,",

    "the @xmath47 level corresponds to a pressure level of 0.1 bars , where day - night temperature variations are small .",
    "all other wavelength bands probe high in the atmosphere , where day - night temperature variations are large ( figure [ tau1 ] ) . for a 50@xmath2 solar composition , the flux variations are large for bands @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 which probe low - pressure regions where day - night temperature variation is high . bands @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 probe deeper pressures , and hence exhibit smaller phase variations .",
    "our results demonstrate that one can break the degeneracy in determining the atmospheric composition of gj 1214b by observing the planet in thermal emission .",
    "large phase variations within water absorption bands and small variations in its spectral windows would indicate a water - dominated atmosphere .",
    "other high - mmw species that are highly absorbing , such as carbon dioxide , ammonia , or methane , might in principle exhibit their own characteristic pattern of lightcurve amplitude with wavelength , depending on the wavelengths of their absorption bands and spectral windows .",
    "as shown in figure [ spectra ] and [ lightcurves ] , a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere should exhibit a pattern of lightcurve amplitude with wavelength that differs significantly from that of a high - mmw atmosphere such as one that is water - dominated .",
    "while we present this method in a generalized sense , one should be able to utilize space - based instruments such as the near - infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) aboard jwst or the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on hst , although the latter has less spectral coverage and would require a multitude of orbits to achieve sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "instruments on the next generation of ground - based telescopes might also be able to utilize this technique , such as the near - infrared spectrometer ( gmtnirs ) on gmt or the infrared multi - object spectrometer ( irms ) on tmt .",
    "however , full - phase lightcurves would be difficult to obtain from the ground in a single observation , and one would have to contend with the water vapor in earth s atmosphere .",
    "therefore , reduction of ground - based observations would be much more difficult . in either case , in order to probe inside and outside water bands effectively as the method requires , spectral observations are necessary .",
    "observations in photometric passbands ( i.e. , broadband observations like those on the _ spitzer space telescope _ ) might be able to apply this method , but would smear out these spectral features .",
    "these results are particularly favorable because they would generally be independent of the the presence of clouds , minor equilibrium condensates or photochemical haze . in transit ,",
    "slant optical depths through the planet s terminator can be dozens of times larger than vertical optical depths @xcite , which can suppress absorption features . in emission , however , paths are closer to vertical , suggesting that it is much easier for hazes to flatten the transmission spectrum than the emission spectrum . still , if the clouds or hazes are sufficiently thick , they would absorb and scatter the emergent flux which could in turn suppress emission features and flux phase variations . given recent @xcite results that gj 1214b likely has clouds or hazes , future work will include exploring how clouds with varying compositions and particle sizes as well as photochemical hazes can affect the phase variations presented here .",

    "we present three - dimensional atmospheric circulation models of the super - earth gj 1214b , exploring changes in circulation as a function of metallicity and composition . for hydrogen - dominated atmospheres ,",
    "atmospheric opacities are enhanced with increasing metallicity , leading to shallower atmospheric heating .",
    "this yields strong dayside - nightside heating / forcing that increases with metallicity , which in turn produces the highest day - night temperature variations and hence the strongest equatorial superrotation in the 50@xmath2 solar model .",
    "the water - dominated composition also exhibits superrotation at the equator and eastward jets at high latitudes , but the circulation of the @xmath1-dominated model is dominated mainly by high - latitude jets .",
    "all three high - mmw models have higher horizontal temperature variations at a given ( low ) pressure than the low - mmw models .",
    "these differences in temperature structure and circulation can be attributed to differences in opacity structure and scale height .",
    "the theoretical dayside lightcurves and spectra presented here lead to a major prediction for how to break the current observational degeneracy in the composition of gj 1214b s atmosphere .",
    "in particular , the water bands dominate the spectra of the 99% @xmath8 , 1% @xmath1 case . within water absorption bands ,",
    "large day - night temperature variations lead to large flux variations with phase . outside of the water bands ( within atmospheric windows ) , these phase variations are small . in comparison ,",
    "a 50@xmath2 solar atmosphere generally yields small phase variations at those wavelength bands and large phase variations at other characteristic bandpasses .",
    "therefore , observing in emission would break the degeneracy to determining the atmospheric composition of gj 1214b .",
    "one could potentially constrain the existence of water or other highly - absorbing species by selecting wavelength bands inside and outside of their atmospheric windows , and comparing the extent of phase variations with that of a low - mmw atmosphere .",
    "this diagnostic is much less sensitive than transit spectra to clouds , condensates and hazes .",
    "however , sufficiently thick clouds and hazes would absorb and scatter emergent flux , therefore diminishing emission features and flux variations with orbital phase .",
