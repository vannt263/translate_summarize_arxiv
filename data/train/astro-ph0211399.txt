    "it is important at the moment to study the characteristics of the non - gaussianity introduced by the alternative theories to standard inflation .",
    "one of the simplest alternative scenarios that will generate weakly non - gaussian cmb fluctuations is one based on slow - roll inflation",
    ". investigated by salopek & bond ( 1990 ) and gangui et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , this model generates non - gaussianity in matter and radiation fluctuation fields through features appearing in the inflaton potential . in the cmb context , the model has been studied by komatsu & spergel ( 2001 ) , verde et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and komatsu et al .",
    "the gravitational potential includes now a quadratic term whith an amplitude regulated by the so called non - linear coupling parameter ( see section 2 ) .",
    "verde et al .",
    "( 2001 ) conclude in their paper that cmb data will be more sensitive to the non - gaussianity generated by these models than observations of high redshift objects .",
    "a semianalytical expression of the bispectrum generated by this model is presented in komatsu & spergel ( 2001 ) .",
    "the minimum non - linear coupling parameter values that will produce detectable non - gaussianity ( based on the bispectrum and skewness statitics ) in different cmb data sets are estimated .",
    "these values are however larger than the ones expected from slow - roll inflation theories .",
    "komatsu et al . ( 2002 ) revised the constraint impossed by _",
    "cobe_-dmr data on the non - linear coupling parameter based on the normalized bispectrum .",
    "this constraint ( slightly larger than the one estimated by komatsu & spergel 2001 ) , though very weak to say much about slow - roll inflation is in any case interesting in itself .",
    "deviations from slow - roll inflation might include larger values of the non - linear coupling parameter generating non - gaussianities that could be detected by cmb experiments .",
    "we want to asses in this paper which is the minimum value of the non - linear coupling parameter that would be constraint by the _ cobe_-dmr data based on a wavelet space statistic .",
    "comparison of this constraint with the one obtained using the normalized bispectrum is an important comparison between two methods that will potentially be used in the analysis of future cmb data . at the moment , simulations of cmb temperature fluctuations generated by the slow - roll inflation model here considered are possible at large angular scales .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "the simulations used in this work are described in section 2 .",
    "the method used to constrain the non - linear coupling parameter is based on the fisher discriminant built on skewness values corresponding to wavelet coefficient maps at several scales .",
    "these method is presented in section 3 .",
    "results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to discussion and conclusions .",
    "at large scales , the cmb temperature fluctuations are dominated by the sachs - wolfe effect and are therefore proportional to the fluctuations of the gravitational potential .",
    "weakly non - gaussian cmb temperature fluctuations will be generated by the introduction of a nonlinear term in the gravitational potential @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 refers to the linear part of the gravitational potential , @xmath0 is the nonlinear coupling parameter controlling the amount of non - gaussianity introduced and the brackets indicate a volume average .",
    "the linear part of the gravitational potential gives rise to cmb temperature fluctuations characterised by a power spectrum that in our case is assumed to be a cdm power spectrum ( computed with the cmbfast software ) with @xmath6 km / s / mpc and @xmath7 and normalized to @xmath8 .",
    "we generate gaussian as well as non - gaussian ( as explained above ) healpix ( grski , hivon & wandelt 1999 ) projected cmb maps that include the observational constraints affecting the _ cobe_-dmr maps .",
    "we apply the method to the 4-year 53 and 90 ghz _",
    "cobe_-dmr maps after adding them using inverse - noise - variance weights .",
    "these maps have a resolution of @xmath9 corresponding to a pixel size of @xmath10 .",
    "only the pixels outside the extended galactic cut  described in banday et al ( 1997 ) but explicitly recomputed for the healpix sky maps  are considered in the computation .",

    "cobe_-dmr observational constraints , the simulated gaussian and non - gaussian maps are convolved with a window function characterising the _",
    "cobe_-dmr one as defined in wright et al .",
    "noise maps , generated with the same observation pattern and rms noise levels as the _",
    "cobe_-dmr data , are added to them .",
    "the extended galactic cut is also impossed to these simulated maps and a best - fit monopole and dipole is as well removed from the pixels outside the cut .",
    "5000 simulated maps are used in the statistical comparison described in the next section .",
    "the aim of this work is to obtain the constraint impossed by the _ cobe_-dmr data on the nonlinear coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we use an approach based on the information provided by wavelets at several scales .",
    "there are at the moment only two wavelets implemented on the sphere that have been used in cmb analyses ; the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( cayn et al . 2001 ; martnez - gonzlez et al . 2001 ) and the spherical haar wavelet ( tenorio et al . 1999 ; barreiro et al .",
    "the former has proved to be more efficient than the spherical haar wavelet in detecting certain kind of non - gaussianity as shown in martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "moreover , the non - gaussianity introduced in the cmb maps by the nonlinear term added to the gravitational potential , is not expected to be dominated by any prefered direction .",
    "therefore a wavelet with spherical symmetry , as the spherical mexican hat , appears to be more appropriate to analyse these data .",
    "simulated gaussian and non - gaussian maps as well as the original _",
    "cobe_-dmr maps are convolved with spherical mexican hat wavelets with sizes ranging from 2 ( 220 arcmins ) to 8 pixels . for these maps",
    "we compute skewness and kurtosis .",
    "the non - gaussianity introduced by the nonlinear term added to the gravitational potential will be visible when we compare distributions for these statistics for the gaussian and non - gaussian cases .",
    "moreover , since the nonlinear term is small in amplitude and quadratic , we will expect the third order cumulant to be larger than any of the higher order cumulants . as an example , the skewness and kurtosis distributions of gaussian and non - gaussian maps at 220 arcmins are compared in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the weakly non - gaussianity introduced in the cmb simulations reflects in skewed distributions .",
    "as expected , the kurtosis seems not to be affected by the nonlinear term .",
    "we will therefore only use the skewness in our final analysis .    in order to combine all the information we have at the seven scales used in the analyses we use the fisher discriminant . being @xmath11 the 7-dimensional data vector including the skewness values at the seven scales , the fisher discriminant @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 where the @xmath14 subscript refers to the gaussian case and the @xmath15 subscript refers to the non - gaussian cases .",
    "@xmath16 gives the sum of the covariance matrixes and @xmath17 refer to the mean values obtained for the gaussian and non - gaussian case respectively .",
    "this statistic has been previously used in other analysis related to detecting non - gaussianity in the cmb ( barreiro & hobson 2001 ; martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "we establish the _",
    "cobe_-dmr constraint on @xmath0 by comparing the _ cobe_-dmr fisher discriminant value with the fisher discriminant distributions obtained for non - gaussian simulations .",
    "fisher discriminant distributions are presented in figure 3 for several non - gaussian cases characterised by the value of the nonlinear coupling coefficient .",
    "comparison of figures 1 and 3 shows the expected fisher discriminant result of increasing the power to distinguish two distributions .",
    "vertical bars in figure 3 are drawn at the _ cobe_-dmr fisher discriminant values for each non - gaussian case considered .",
    "in order to obtain a constraint on @xmath0 we calculate the probability of observing a fisher discriminant value larger than the _",
    "cobe_-dmr one for each of the non - gaussian cases . these probabilities are presented in table 1 . as one can see the _",
    "cobe_-dmr data set a constraint on @xmath18 at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "c|c @xmath0 & prob(@xmath19 )    1000 & 63.0 1100 & 68.7 -1100&98.9 1200 & 70.2 1300 & 76.6 -1300&99.4 1400 & 78.6 1500 & 81.2 2000 & 93.4 2500 & 97.9 3000 & 99.3    in all previous calculations we have only considered positive values of the nonlinear coupling coefficient . to study the effect of having a negative @xmath0 on the fisher discriminant values , we have simulated 5000 non - gaussian maps with @xmath20 .",
    "the distribution of temperature fluctuations in the map would be expected in this case to be shifted towards negative values in the same way as the distribution of temperature fluctuations is shifted towards positive values for @xmath21 ( as can be seen from the skewness distributions presented in figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , we would expect the distribution of skewness values in the case of @xmath22 to be towards the left of the distribution for @xmath23 .",
    "same behaviour is observed for the fisher discriminant distributions as can be seen in figure 4 .",
    "the cases for @xmath24 are also included in that figure for comparison . the power to distinguish the gaussian and non - gaussian distributions is approximately the same for the positive and negative values of @xmath0 . at the @xmath25 confidence level , the power of the fisher discriminant test is @xmath26 for @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the same `` symmetric '' behaviour would therefore be expected for the any negative @xmath0 value in relation to the positive one .",
    "as one can see from figure 4 the locus of the _ cobe_-dmr fisher discriminant value does not change much ( the probability of obtaining gaussian values larger than the _",
    "cobe_-dmr ones is approximately the same ) .",
    "the probability of having non - gaussian values smaller than _ cobe_-dmr ones is @xmath28 for the case of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the case of @xmath31 .",
    "the negative values of @xmath0 are therefore better constrained than the positive ones .",
    "we can conclude that the _ cobe_-dmr data set a constraint on the absolute value of the nonlinear coupling parameter of @xmath1 at the @xmath2 confidence level .    in order to account for the possible influence of foregrounds we have also analysed the _",
    "cobe_-dmr data after foreground removal ( using _ cobe_-dirbe data ) .",
    "the results obtained are consistent with the ones presented above .",
    "weakly non - gaussian cmb temperature fluctuations can be generated by the presence of a nonlinear term in the gravitational potential .",
    "the amount of nonlinearity can be controlled by the so called nonlinear coupling parameter @xmath0 . at large scales ,",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations are proportional to the gravitational potential .",
    "simulations of weakly non - gaussian cmb temperature fluctuations maps at these large scales are therefore reasonably easy to make .",
    "the aim of this paper is to set a constraint on the value of the nonlinear coupling parameter by using the _ cobe_-dmr data .",
    "we perform 5000 simulations of gaussian and several non - gaussian models characterised by the value of @xmath0 , impossing the _ cobe_-dmr observational constraints . with the aid of the spherical mexican hat wavelet , we are able to obtain the skewness of these maps at several scales . all this information is combined into the fisher discriminant .",

    "we are able to set @xmath1 at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "this is a tighter contraint than the one previously found by komatsu et al .",
