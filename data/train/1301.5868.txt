    "over a century ago frobenius and schur understood that the complex representation theory of the symmetric groups @xmath0 for all @xmath1 categorifies the graded hopf algebra of symmetric functions @xmath2 .",
    "the language being used here is much more recent ! it means the following .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the category of finite dimensional @xmath4-modules and @xmath5 be the irreducible specht module indexed by partition @xmath6 .",
    "the isomorphism classes @xmath7\\:|\\:\\lambda \\vdash n\\}$ ] give a distinguished basis for grothendieck group @xmath8 $ ] of this semisimple category .",
    "given an @xmath9-module @xmath10 and an @xmath0-module @xmath11 , we can form their induction product @xmath12 .",
    "this operation descends to the grothendieck groups to give a multiplication making @xmath13 : = \\bigoplus_{n \\geq 0 } [ { \\operatorname{rep}}({\\mathbb{c}}s_n)]\\ ] ] into a graded algebra .",
    "moreover the restriction functors @xmath14 for all @xmath15 induce a comultiplication on @xmath16 $ ] , making it into a graded hopf algebra .",
    "the categorificiation theorem asserts that it is isomorphic as a graded hopf algebra to @xmath2 , the canonical isomorphism sending @xmath17 $ ] to the _ schur function _ @xmath18 .",
    "there have been many variations and generalizations of this result since then . perhaps the most relevant for",
    "this article comes from the work of bernstein and zelevinsky in the late 1970s on the representation theory of the affine hecke algebra @xmath19 associated to the general linear group @xmath20 over a non - archimedean local field @xmath21 ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "this is even richer algebraically since , unlike @xmath4 , its finite dimensional representations are no longer completely reducible .",
    "bernstein and zelevinsky showed that the direct sum @xmath22 : = \\bigoplus_{n \\geq 0 } [ \\operatorname{rep}(h_n)]\\ ] ] of the grothendieck groups of the categories of finite dimensional @xmath19-modules for all @xmath1 again has a natural structure of graded hopf algebra .",
    "moreover this graded hopf algebra is isomorphic to the coordinate algebra @xmath23 $ ] of a certain direct limit @xmath24 of groups of upper unitriangular matrices . in @xcite , zelevinsky went on to formulate a @xmath25-adic analogue of the kazhdan - lusztig conjecture , which was proved by ginzburg @xcite .",
    "zelevinsky s conjecture implies that the basis for @xmath23 $ ] arising from the isomorphism classes of irreducible @xmath19-modules for all @xmath1 coincides with the lusztig - kashiwara dual canonical basis . the dual version of this theorem was proved by ariki in @xcite , who also investigated certain finite dimensional quotients of @xmath19 called _ cyclotomic hecke algebras _ , which categorify the integrable highest weight modules of the corresponding lie algebra @xmath26 .",
    "ariki s work includes the case that the defining parameter of @xmath19 is a primitve @xmath25th root of unity , when @xmath27 is replaced by the affine kac - moody algebra @xmath28 .",
    "quiver hecke algebras were discovered independently in 2008 by khovanov and lauda @xcite and rouquier @xcite .",
    "they are certain hecke algebras attached to symmetrizable cartan matrices .",
    "it appears that khovanov and lauda came upon these algebras from an investigation of endomorphisms of soergel bimodules ( and related bimodules which arise from cohomology of partial flag varieties ) , while rouquier s motivation was a close analysis of lusztig s construction of canonical bases in terms of perverse sheaves on certain quiver varieties . in a perfect analogy with the bernstein - zelevinsky theory just described ,",
    "these algebras categorify the coordinate algebra of the unipotent group @xmath24 associated to a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of the kac - moody algebra @xmath29 arising from the given cartan matrix .",
    "in fact the picture is even better : the quiver hecke algebras are naturally @xmath30-graded , so that the grothendieck groups of their categories of finite dimensional graded representations are @xmath31$]-modules , with @xmath32 acting by degree shift .",
    "the resulting `` graded '' grothendieck groups categorify a @xmath31$]-form for the quantum group @xmath33 that is half of the quantized enveloping algebra @xmath34 .",
    "moreover there is an analogue of ariki s theorem , conjectured originally by khovanov ",
    "lauda and proved by varagnolo - vasserot @xcite and rouquier ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 5.8 ) using geometric methods in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "there are even cyclotomic quotients of the quiver hecke algebras which kang - kashiwara @xcite , rouquier ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.25 ) and webster @xcite have used to categorify integrable highest weight modules .",
    "rouquier also observed in ( finite or affine ) type a that the quiver hecke algebras become isomorphic to the affine hecke algebras discussed earlier ( at a generic parameter or a root of unity ) when suitably localized ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.15 ) and also @xcite in the cyclotomic setting ) .",
    "thus ariki s theorem is a special case of the rouquier - varagnolo - vasserot categorificiation theorem just mentioned ( see @xcite ) .",
    "even more variations on the quiver hecke algebras have subsequently emerged , including a twisted version related to affine hecke algebras of type b introduced by varagnolo and vasserot @xcite , and the quiver hecke superalgebras of kang , kashiwara and tsuchioka @xcite .",
    "the latter superalgebras generalize wang s spin hecke algebras @xcite and the odd nil hecke algebra of ellis , khovanov and lauda @xcite , and give a completely new `` supercategorification '' of the same quantum groups / highest weight modules as above ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also mention the work @xcite which connects quiver hecke algebras to quantum affine algebras , potentially providing a direct algebraic link between the categorifications of @xmath23 $ ] arising via quiver hecke algebras and the ones introduced by hernandez and leclerc in @xcite .    for the future",
    "perhaps the most exciting development arising from these new algebras is the introduction again by khovanov - lauda @xcite and rouquier @xcite of certain @xmath35-categories called _ @xmath35-kac - moody algebras_. these categorify lusztig s idempotented version @xmath36 of the quantized enveloping algebra of @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) . in the case",
    "@xmath37 this goes back to work of chuang - rouquier @xcite and lauda @xcite . in the introduction of @xcite ,",
    "rouquier promises to define a tensor product on the 2-category of dg @xmath35-representations of the @xmath35-kac - moody algebra , the ultimate goal being to construct 4-dimensional tqfts in fulfillment of predictions made long ago by crane and frenkel @xcite .",
    "webster has also suggested a more down - to - earth diagrammatic approach to constructing categorifications of tensor products of integrable highest weight modules in finite types in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will not discuss at all any of these higher themes , aiming instead to give a gentle and self - contained introduction to the quiver hecke algebras and their connection to lusztig s algebra @xmath38 , focussing just on the case of symmetric cartan matrices for simplicity . in the last section of the article we specialize further to finite type and explain some of the interesting homological properties of quiver hecke algebras in that setting , similar in spirit to those of a quasi - hereditary algebra , despite being infinite - dimensional .",
    "as we go we have included proofs or sketch proofs of many of the foundational results , before switching into full survey mode later on . to improve readability , references to the literature are deferred to the end of each section .",
    "in this opening section , we give a general introduction to the definition and structure of quiver hecke algebras .",
    "fix once and for all an algebraically closed ground field @xmath39 . everything ( vector spaces , algebras , modules ,  ) will be @xmath30-graded . for a graded vector space @xmath40 ,",
    "its graded dimension is @xmath41 , where @xmath32 is a formal variable . of course",

    "we write @xmath45 for the upward degree shift by @xmath46 steps , so @xmath45 is the graded vector space with @xmath47 , and then @xmath48 . more generally , for @xmath49 , we write @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",

    "note then that @xmath59 is a graded algebra .",
    "recall that the symmetric group @xmath0 is generated by the basic transpositions @xmath60 subject only to the braid relations @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , plus the quadratic relations @xmath64 .",
