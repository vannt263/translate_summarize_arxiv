    "transport properties in liquids are relevant for various applications ranging from solvation of tablets  @xcite the penetration of salt ions into fresh river water  @xcite to imbibition problems  @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a need for a basic understanding of particle diffusion on the most fundamental level of the individual particles .",
    "the particle trajectories , as governed by newton s equation of motion with the interparticle forces , are the natural starting point to understand and predict the transport properties  @xcite . already in equilibrium",
    "this is still a nontrivial problem of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "complex plasmas  @xcite which contain mesoscopic dust grains are ideal model systems to follow the dynamics on the time and length scale of the individual particles .",
    "typically the dust particles are highly charged such that there are strong repulsive effective interactions between neighbors . at high densities ,",
    "the system can therefore exhibit both fluid and solid phases  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the particle dynamics in a two - dimensional complex plasma which is exposed to an external magnetic field of strength @xmath0 .",
    "though the presence of a magnetic field does not alter the equilibrium static properties , such as phase transitions , the dynamics are strongly affected  @xcite . due to the lorentz force ,",
    "the charged particles exhibit a circular motion  @xcite which is expected to slow the dynamics down .",
    "therefore the magnetic field opens the fascinating possibility to change the dynamical properties of the system externally without changing the system itself , e.g. , ref .",

    "[ fig : traj_ex ] ]    some aspects of the one - component dust particle dynamics in a magnetic field have been considered in previous studies  @xcite . in particular , the motion of few - particle clusters in magnetic fields has been studied both by experiments and simulation  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of three - dimensional ionic binary mixture have also been under investigation in early as well as recent research  @xcite , with a particular focus on astrophysical plasmas and those encountered in inertial confinement fusion .    here , we focus on two - dimensional systems and explore the long - time dynamics by computer simulations .",
    "we confirm the @xmath5-scaling of the long - time diffusion coefficient for strong magnetic fields  @xcite for the two - dimensional system .",
    "we moreover consider binary systems composed of high - charge and low - charge particles  @xcite . our motivation to study a binary system comes from the fact that the magnetic field affects the dynamics of the particle species differently .",
    "thereby , the individual particle dynamics can be steered externally via the magnetic field .",
    "one important parameter is the mobility ratio of the two species which governs the mutual diffusion and is one key parameter for the nature of the kinetic glass transition in mixtures  @xcite .",
    "this ratio is typically fixed by the mass ratio  @xcite and the interactions  @xcite and can therefore not easily be tuned . here",
    "we show that this ratio can be controlled by an external magnetic field insofar as the high - charge particles are more immobilized than the low - charge particles . for large magnetic fields ,",
    "it is even conceivable that the high - charge particles are almost immobilized while the low - charge particles are still mobile .",
    "this opens the way to realize a porous model matrix in two dimensions .",
    "recently a similar matrix has been created by adsorbing colloidal particles to a substrate  @xcite .",
    "our approach , however , is more flexible as everything can be controlled externally .",

    "[ fig : dratio_binary ] , this is demonstrated for strong coupling , @xmath54 , by plotting the ratio @xmath56 . while a modest charge ratio of @xmath57 results only in a small variation of this ratio , the influence of the magnetic field grows with decreasing @xmath20 , so that at @xmath49 , the magnetic field alone can be used to manipulate the mobility ratio by a factor of two for @xmath52 ( see right - hand scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : dratio_binary ] ) .",
    "since the mobility ratio plays a crucial role during the glass transition , this effect can be leveraged to investigate the conditions for glass formation in one and the same system by controlling the mobility ratio by the external magnetic field .",
    "the relatively simple , monotonic dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath6 for strongly coupled plasmas shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : dratio_binary ] has to be contrasted with the more intricate behavior of the same ratio for @xmath1 ( lower graph in fig .",

    "note that small values of @xmath61 correspond to large magnetic fields , and vice versa . ]",
    "the microscopic reason for the suppression at large magnetic fields lies in the reduced mobility of the lightly charged species . in a qualitative way",
    ", it can be traced back to a geometric origin by considering the ratio of length scales @xmath60 between the larmor radius @xmath62 of the lightly charged species and the average nearest - neighbor distance @xmath63 of the highly charged species . a lightly charged particle situated between two highly charged ones",
    "will be forced on a curved trajectory by the magnetic field . at @xmath64 , this trajectory leads , at thermal velocity of the particle , to a collision with one of the highly charged particle , effectively preventing the diffusion of the lightly charged particle ( see schematic in fig .  [",
    "fig : dratio_delta ] ) .",
    "this results in a reduction of @xmath56 at @xmath64 .",
    "we have tested this simple geometric reason by plotting data for the mobility ratio as a function of the geometric parameter @xmath61 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dratio_delta ] ( notice that @xmath62 is a function of both @xmath7 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "in fact , a resonant dip in the mobility ratio is formed around @xmath64 supporting the underlying picture .",
    "this geometric resonance effect persists across different parameter regimes , but becomes less pronounced as @xmath20 or @xmath7 are increased , since an increased particle coupling leads to stronger caging effects .",
    "in conclusion , we have explored the dynamics of charged particles in a complex plasma layer exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field which allows for an additional external control parameter for the particle transport .",
    "our simulation results can be verified in experiments of dusty plasmas either in magnetic fields  @xcite or in rotating electrodes which formally lead to the same equations of motion  @xcite .",
    "binary systems can also be realized in dusty plasmas , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the mobility in two - dimensional systems adheres to the same @xmath5-bohm scaling as in three - dimensional systems .",
    "in contrast to three - dimensional systems , however , the functional form of the scaling is largely independent of the coupling @xmath7 , indicating a decoupling of magnetic and interaction effects .",
    "our main focus has been on the response of a charge - asymmetric binary mixture to an external magnetic field .",
    "since the two subsystems are affected differently by the magnetic field , the mobility ratio between them can be controlled by the strength of the magnetic field . for less",
    "strongly coupled systems and high charge - asymmetry , we have found that the circular trajectories of the lightly charged particles can be in resonance with the positional configuration of the highly charged particles , which leads to a distinct reduction of the mobility of the former .",
    "this is an interesting realization of a porous model matrix in a fluid system .    for future studies ,",
    "as regards binary systems , a systematic understanding of the two - dimensional glass transition in binary mixtures is lying ahead where the magnetic field is exploited as a steering wheel to change the mobility ratio between the particle species .",
    "moreover , it is known that the crystallization process out of an undercooled melt depends sensitively on the mobility ratio in binary systems @xcite such that the magnetic field can be used to tune crystal nucleation in mixtures @xcite .",
