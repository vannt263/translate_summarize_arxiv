    "this gives rise to a rich variety of phenomena that evolve at very short time and spatial scales .",
    "the imax instrument ( imaging magnetograph experiment ; martnez pillet et al .",
    "2011a ) onboard of stratospheric balloon sunrise ( barthol et al . 2011 ; solanki et al . 2012 ) has helped to uncover many of these phenomena ( see e.g. solanki et al .",
    "2010 ) , from resolving magnetic flux - tubes ( lagg et al .",
    "2010 ) , to finding vortex tubes ( steiner et al .",
    "2010 ) , vortex flows ( bonet et al .",
    "2010 ) , etc .",
    "one of those discoveries involves supersonic magnetic upflows ( borrero et al . 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "these events are characterized by highly blue - shifted circular polarization signals , that appear at the center or edges of granular cells and last for about 80 seconds .",
    "similar events were subsequently found also in data from the sp instrument onboard the hinode spacecraft ( martnez pillet et al .",
    "the fact that magnetic fields of opposite polarity connected by horizontal fields appear in the vicinity of these events in 70 % of the cases , led us to surmise that they are caused by magnetic reconnection . in this paper",
    "we study them in more detail using a different data set from the imax instrument .",
    "a comparison between the old and new data sets is provided in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we describe the criterion employed to select events . the analysis technique , namely , the inversion of the observed stokes profiles to retrieve the physical conditions of the solar atmosphere , is detailed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents our results while section 6 briefly addresses the choice of model for the inversion .",
    "finally , section 7 presents our main conclusions .",
    "the data employed in this work were recorded with the stratospheric balloon - borne observatory sunrise ( solanki et al .",
    "2010 ; barthol et al .",
    "sunrise was launched on june 8 , 2009 from kiruna ( sweden ) and landed on june 13 , 2009 on somerset island ( canada ) . during this time",
    ", sunrise s 1-meter telescope took broad - band images in different spectral windows with the sufi instrument ( gandorfer et al .",
    "2011 ) , and spectropolarimetric data of the solar photosphere with imax ( martnez pillet et al .",
    "an average flight altitude of 35 km allowed sunrise to avoid more than 95 % of the disturbances introduced by earth s atmosphere .",
    "in addition , image motions due to wind during the flight were stabilized by the correlation - tracker and wavefront sensor ( cws ; berkefeld et al .",
    "owing to the aforementioned advantages , imax spectropolarimetric data yielded a spatial resolution of 0.25 `` and a field - of - view of 50''@xmath050 `` . further image reconstruction based on phase diversity calibration of the psf of the optical system improved the resolution to 0.15''-0.18 `` . + in borrero et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we employed reconstructed imax data that included the four components of the stokes vector ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) measured at five wavelength positions across the 5250.217  spectral line . in the following we will refer to this observing mode as v5 - 6 . in this work , however , we will use a different observing mode , referred to as l12 - 2 . in this mode",
    "the intensity @xmath1 and circular polarization @xmath4 were measured in twelve ( instead of five ) wavelength positions ) . for reasons that will be explained later , we restricted ourselves to employ non - reconstructed data with a spatial resolution of _ only _ 0.25 '' .",
    "+ figure 1 displays the region of the intensity spectra around the 5250.217 spectral line , as recorded by the fourier transform spectrometer in the quiet sun ( wallace et al .",
    "1998 ) . crosses in this figure show the five wavelength positions scanned by the v5 - 6 data used in borrero et al .",
    "these were located at @xmath5 $ ] m from line - center .",
    "filled circles illustrate the wavelength positions scanned in the l12 - 2 observing mode . here",
    ", the wavelength range goes from @xmath6 m to @xmath7 m , in twelve positions equidistantly distributed in steps of 35 m .",
    "+        the lack of linear polarization profiles @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the l12 - 2 observing mode makes the polarimetric calibration of the data slightly more difficult to implement compared to v5 - 6 .",
    "the instrument s calibration matrix had been theoretically calculated ( martnez pillet et al .",
    "2011a ) and experimentally confirmed at the inta ( instituto nacional de tcnicas aeroespaciales ) facilities in spain ( martnez pillet 2007 ; del toro iniesta & martnez pillet 2012 ) such that linear polarization cross - talk could be minimized by tuning the voltages of the nematic liquid crystals to the appropiate retardances .",
    "unfortunately , this calibration stage was not performed while mated to the sunrise telescope ( main and secondary mirrors ) which introduced more cross - talk than anticipated .",
    "therefore , we expected to find a non - negligible contribution from @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the measured linear combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "fortunately , the events that we will focus on , the so - called _ supersonic magnetic upflows in granular cells _ , had already been analyzed using the v5 - 6 observing mode . from that data",
    "we learned that these events have a negligible amount of linear polarization ( although patches of enhanced linear polarization usually appear within 2 \" of these events ; see for instance fig .  4 in borrero et al .",
    "2010 and figs .  3 - 7 in borrero et al . 2012 ) .",
    "this means that , even in our scenario , where there is a significant cross - talk from @xmath2 and @xmath3 into stokes @xmath4 , the circular polarization is not affected much .",
    "the uncorrected cross - talk does however slightly increase the noise level in the circular polarization .",
    "+ imax used the l12 - 2 mode to observe the solar photosphere for about 60 minutes on june 10 , 2009 .",
    "the observations were recorded close to disk center , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 corresponds to the heliocentric angle . due to pointing problems ,",
    "the time series was interrupted several times and only about half of that time is usable . in total",
    ", there are 52 full scans of stokes @xmath1 and @xmath4 in twelve wavelength positions .",
    "each scan is recorded during a time interval of 33 seconds .",
    "the noise - level is estimated to be @xmath10 in units of the average quiet sun continuum intensity .",
    "in borrero et al . ( 2010 ) , where we employed v5 - 6 , the supersonic magnetic upflows were detected in the circular polarization ( stokes @xmath4 ) at @xmath11 m ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "at this wavelength any signal can be produced by either a strong red - shift ( downflow ) from 5250.217  or by strong blue - shift ( upflow ) from 5250.653  . in the aforementioned work ,",
    "the signal was ascribed to the latter case because the stokes @xmath1 signal from 5250.217  was blue - shifted .",
    "+ bearing this information in mind , we look for a strategy to find highly blue - shifted stokes @xmath4 profiles in the l12 - 2 data . the first idea that comes to mind is to use the blue - most wavelength position in these data , @xmath12 m , to find such upflows .",
    "unfortunately , this scanning position is not far enough towards the blue to guarantee that the observed signal at this wavelength is only due to large velocities , as it could also be caused by a magnetic field that shifts the @xmath13-component of stokes @xmath4 into this wavelength . indeed",
    ", displaying @xmath14@xmath15 , reveals a pattern that closely resembles the network .",
    "thus , this wavelength alone can not be employed to uniquely identify large upflows .",
    "+ in order to disentangle network elements from possible supersonic magnetic upflows , we propose a different strategy , in which we compare the circular polarization close to the spectral line core and the circular polarization close to the blue continuum .",
    "let us refer to these two quantities as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "they are defined as :    @xmath18\\\\ v_{\\rm c } = \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i=1}^{i=2 } |v(\\lambda_i)| \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the index @xmath19 runs from the blue - most ( @xmath20 ) o the red - most ( @xmath21 ) scanning positions indicated by the filled circles in fig .  1 .",
    "we note that , in the definition of @xmath17 we are subtracting stokes @xmath4 in the red wing ( @xmath22 ) from stokes @xmath4 in the blue wing ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is done in order to obtain the polarity of the magnetic field vector , and has the additional benefit of partially canceling the noise . + in the top - left panel of figure 2 we display @xmath17 ( normalized to the averaged quiet sun continuum intensity @xmath24 ) over a portion of the full field - of - view from one of our available 52 snapshots .",
    "the regions of enhanced @xmath17 correspond mostly to the network elements since the circular polarization close to the line - center is large . in the top - right panel of figure 2",
    "we plot , for the same region , the absolute value of the quotient of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this panel",
    ", the network appears as those regions where @xmath25 .",
    "regions where @xmath26 denote stokes @xmath4 profiles that are highly blue - shifted .",
    "our selection criterion will consider as _ supersonic magnetic upflows _ any pixel in the field - of - view where @xmath27 . in figure 2 , those regions are indicated by the white contours .",
    "note that the selected events also coincide with the center / edges of granular cells where the line - of - sight velocity is blue - shifted by about @xmath28 km s@xmath29 ( see black contours in the left - bottom and right - bottom panels in figure 2 ) .",
    "this confirms that the selected events have the same properties as those studied in borrero et al .",
    "+ the line - of - sight velocity @xmath30 displayed in figure 2 is obtained by calculating the center - of - gravity of stokes @xmath1 and correcting for gravitational red - shift , convective blue - shift , and for the wavelength shift across the fov due to the collimated configuration of the instrument ( see sect .  9.1 in martnez pillet et al .",
    "we mention this in order to avoid confusion with the @xmath30 that will be used in the next sections of this paper , which will be inferred from the simultaneous fitting of stokes @xmath1 and @xmath4 . + it is also important to clarify that figure 2 shows a somewhat exceptional situation , in which three events occur on a small portion of the full field - of - view .",
    "this case has been selected to highlight the properties of the selected events , but by no means corresponds to the typical case seen in the observations .",
    "in fact , from the 52 available snapshots , the aforementioned selection criteria selects 857 pixels , belonging to 122 events .",
    "this results in an average of 2.3 events in each 50``@xmath050 '' snapshot . unfortunately , the pointing problems described in sect",
    ".  2 prevented us from having a continuous time - series and therefore we can not track each event in time .",
    "thus , some of those 122 events might correspond to the same one but at different times in their evolution .",
    "consequently , we can not compare these numbers with the occurrence rates obtained in borrero et al . 2010 . +    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this section we discuss the choice of model and free parameters in the inversion described in section 4 . to make this choice we look at the observed stokes profiles and try to establish the most suitable model to fit them .",
    "the first step is to realize that , as illustrated in fig .  3 , all 857 selected stokes @xmath4 profiles feature the almost complete lack of one of the lobes ( produced by the @xmath31 transitions in the zeeman pattern ) in the circular polarization .",
    "+ the question is now to decide whether these kind of profiles are really asymmetric , or on the other hand , they are symmetric but the missing lobe in stokes @xmath4 is located at @xmath32 m , hence lying just outside of the region scanned by imax",
    ". this question can be answered by looking at the wavelength region around @xmath33 m in figs . 4 , 5 and 6 ( bottom - right panels ) .",
    "the average observed stokes profiles ( filled circles ) for all families around this region is negative and , although small , clearly above the noise level .",
    "we have established that this corresponds to the stokes @xmath4 signal from the nearby 5250.653  spectral line by repeating all the inversions described in section 4 , but excluding this spectral line ( see table 1 ) . in this case , the fitted profiles in the bottom - right panels in figs .  4 - 5 - 6 ( solid - black lines )",
    "fail to reproduce the negative values of stokes @xmath4 around @xmath33 m . with this in mind",
    "we now move to @xmath32 m and conclude that , if there is a missing positive lobe in stokes @xmath4 there , then the signal from 5250.653  at @xmath33 should also be positive .",
    "however , it is negative , and therefore we conclude that the observed stokes @xmath4 profile from 5250.653  are indeed asymmetric and that there is no missing positive lobe at @xmath32 m .",
    "+ once established that the observed circular polarization profiles are highly asymmetric , we follow solanki & montavon ( 1993 ) and landolfi & landi deglinnocenti ( 1996 ) and consider that those asymmetries are caused by the simultaneous effect of gradients in the line - of - sight velocity @xmath30 , and in line - of - sight component of the magnetic field vector @xmath34 .",
    "the large number of nodes allowed in @xmath35 ( see sect .  4 ) is a direct consequence of the need to fit these extremely asymmetric stokes @xmath4 profiles .",
    "+ gradients in @xmath36 have been included by , as already mentioned , allowing two nodes in @xmath37 and one node in @xmath38 .",
    "this combination is more general than allowing two nodes for @xmath38 and only one for @xmath37 .",
    "this is a consequence of the modulus of the magnetic field vector being defined as a positive quantity which makes , unlike the former case , the inversion with only one node in @xmath37 unable to yield solutions where @xmath36 changes sign with optical depth .",
    "the possibility of obtaining solutions where @xmath36 changes sign does not imply that all inferred stratification will actually have it ( i.e. _ family _ 3 ; see sect .",
    "5.3 and fig .  6 ) .",
    "+ since our discussion in the next section will rely heavily on the presence of a reversal in the polarity of the magnetic field , it is crucial to establish whether this feature is really needed to reproduce the observed profiles . to this end",
    "we once more repeated our inversions ( as described in sect .  4 ) but employing this time one node in @xmath37 and two in @xmath38 . in this case , all retrieved stratification in @xmath39 show the same sign at all optical depths ( as in _ family 3 _ ) .",
    "interestingly , the quality of the fits worsens significantly .",
    "the average value of the merit function , @xmath40 , doubles in those pixels that belonged to _ families _ 1 and 2 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath40 also increases in those pixels that belonged to _ family 3 _ , but comparatively less ( @xmath41 % ) .",
    "these results suggest that allowing two nodes in @xmath37 is necessary to successfully fitting the observed stokes profiles , and therefore also that , the inferred reversal in the polarity of the magnetic field @xmath36 ( in _ families _ 1 an 2 ) is not an artifact imposed by our choice of model , but rather a characteristic feature of these events .",
    "+ finally , as previously discussed , a model that contains only one component assumes that the solar photophere is laterally homogeneous within each observed pixel , or at least , assumes that the vertical variations in the physical parameters play a more important role than the horizontal ones in the formation of the observed spectral line .",
    "while there is no guarantee that this is indeed the case , the high spatial resolution achieved by sunrise / imax makes this approximation a reasonable first step in the study of these events .",
    "the results presented here confirm our initial conclusions in our previous studies ( borrero et al . 2010 , 2012 ) on these extremely shifted polarization signals .",
    "namely that , * a ) * they occur mostly at the center or edges of granular cells ; * b ) * they are characterized by supersonic upward velocities ; * c ) * they involve magnetized plasma , and d ) magnetic fields of opposity polarities are oftentimes ( @xmath42 % of the cases ) seen in their proximity ( @xmath43 ) . in addition to this , the inversion of the stokes profiles reveals that these events seem to belong to three distinct families .",
    "these families frequently present features such : * e ) * temperature enhancement of a few hundred kelvin in the mid - photosphere ; * f ) * shift from supersonic upflows to supersonic downflows at some height in the photosphere ; and * g ) * presence of a reversal in the polarity of the magnetic field vector also at some height in the photosphere at the exact location where the event occurs .",
    "+ owing to their common features , and under the assumption that only one physical mechanism is responsible for all the observed events , it would be almost straightforward to consider magnetic reconnection as their probable cause : magnetic field lines of opposite polarity coalesce and the energy stored in the magnetic field is released into kinetic and thermal energy .",
    "the two different polarities would channel the plasma in different directions giving rise to both positive and negative line - of - sight velocities ( rezaei et al .",
    "2007 ; cameron et al .",
    "unfortunately , not all investigated pixels share the aforementioned properties . for instance , only some cases ( _ families _ 1 and 3 ) show both positive and negative supersonic line - of - sight velocities @xmath30 , while _ family _ 2 posseses only @xmath44 ( upflows ) . in addition , the reversal in the polarity of the magnetic field vector is not always present ( e.g _ family _ 3 ; see fig .  6 ) , and only in the case of _",
    "family 1 _ ( 14.3 % of the cases ) the reversal in @xmath36 occurs at the same location as the change in the sign of @xmath30 .",
    "+ on the one hand , taking into account that the interaction between magnetic fields and granular convection leads to a rich variety of phenomena , it is conceivable that the differences between the inferred families are caused by the underlying physical mechanism being different in each case .",
    "although there are many possible candidates , a search across the available literature ( steiner et al 1998 ; cheung et al .",
    "2008 ; and references therein ) does not reveal any mechanism that reproduces the observational features , neither in general nor of the individual families , of the events studied in this work . for instance , the supersonic flows predicted by cattaneo et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and later observed by rybck et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and bellot rubio ( 2009 ) , occur above granules and involve supersonic flows , but they are mostly horizontal and therefore their contribution to @xmath30 is unlikely to be large .",
    "flux - emergence processes described in cheung et al .",
    "( 2008 ) take place also in granules , but they do not seem to involve very large upflows . _",
    "swaying motions _ in flux tubes ( steiner et al . 1998 ) excite up - ward propagating shock fronts , but they occur mainly above intergranular lanes . finally , _ vortex tubes _ that were originally found in granules ( steiner et al .",
    "2010 ) have been recently associated with fast upflows but on nearby dark lanes ( yurchyshyn et al . 2011 ) and therefore , they probably correspond to a different kind of event .",
    "+ on the other hand , one could attempt to salvage the hypothesis of reconnection by adopting different views .",
    "for instance , we could argue that one can not expect all families to be fully consistent with the classic picture of magnetic reconnection , because they might correspond to different stages in the temporal evolution of the events ( see cameron et al .",
    "2011 ) . in order to rule out or to confirm this possibility",
    ", one would need an uninterrupted , and possibly longer , time - series of l12 - 2 data .",
    "hopefully , this will be possible in the incoming second flight from sunrise / imax that is scheduled to take place in the summer of 2013 .",
    "it can also be argued that , even if events belonging to _ family _ 3 do not show a polarity reversal in the magnetic field , this reversal can indeed take place in the upper - photosphere ( @xmath45 ; see sect .",
    "5.3 ) . moreover , even if the polarity reversal is not present on the same pixel , in borrero et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we had already detected opposite polarities within 2 \" in 70% of the events . in the future",
    ", it would be very interesting to combine imax observations with data from the upcoming iris mission , to study a possible relationship between these reconnection events and the presence of mostly unipolar regions ( coronal holes ) and/or type ii spicules in the chromosphere ( mcintosh et al .",
