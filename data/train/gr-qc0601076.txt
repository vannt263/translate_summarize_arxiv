    "several interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors are now operational around the world  @xcite in addition to an already operating set of resonant mass detectors  @xcite . since gravitational wave detectors can measure both the amplitude and phase of incoming signals , it is possible to combine the data from such a network of detectors to not only detect gw sources better , compared to single detectors , but also estimate the waveforms of the two independent polarization components of the gw signal along with the direction to the source .",
    "a straightforward approach to signal detection and estimation using data from a network of detectors is through the likelihood  @xcite functional .",
    "the likelihood functional of data @xmath0 is the joint probability density function @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a vector of parameters whose true value for any given instance of @xmath0 is not known _ a priori_. in the case of gw detection , @xmath0 is the collection of outputs from all the detectors in a network and the parameters are the sky position of the gw source and the waveforms of the two gw polarization components , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the problem of signal detection is concerned with deciding whether @xmath0 is a realization of @xmath5 or @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the signal absent case .",
    "the estimation problem deals with infering the true value of @xmath8 once a detection has been made .",
    "according to the maximum likelihood  @xcite approach to inference , the value @xmath9 at which the likelihood functional attains its maximum serves as an estimate of the true value of @xmath8 .",
    "the maximum , over @xmath8 , of the likelihood ratio ( lr ) functional @xmath10 yields a detection statistic .",
    "thus , the likelihood based approach conveniently yields both a detection statistic and source parameter estimates .    for binary inspiral signals ,",
    "the polarization waveforms can be computed in terms of a small set of parameters describing the binary , such as the masses of the two stars , the orbital inclination etc .",
    "likelihood based network analysis is fairly well understood in the case of such known waveforms  @xcite . in this paper , we consider likelihood based network analysis for burst signals that are short duration deterministic signals but have unreliable or simply unknown waveforms .",
    "astrophysical sources of burst signals include supernovae  @xcite , gamma ray bursts  @xcite and the merger of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes  @xcite .",
    "although we do not have prior knowledge of burst signal waveforms , it is possible to extend likelihood based network analysis to burst signals in a formal sense .",
    "the basic idea  @xcite is to treat each sample of a burst signal as a parameter and maximize the likelihood over all the parameters .",
    "we refer to the resulting detection method as standard likelihood ( sl ) .",
    "other approaches to network analysis for burst signals have also been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the method  @xcite proposed by grsel and tinto is based on extremizing a functional that is constructed purely out of the response of each detector in a network and does not explicitly depend on the polarization waveforms .",
    "a minimum of three misaligned detectors are required in order to use the grsel - tinto method whereas likelihood based methods do not have this limitation .",
    "although it is quite elegant , the sl method has a fundamental problem that was first noted in  @xcite and systematically analyzed in  @xcite ( henceforth , kmrm ) . called the two detector paradox , the problem is most easily stated for a network of two detectors .",
    "when the detectors are perfectly aligned , the sl detection statistic naturally includes the cross - correlation of detector outputs . since the response to a given gw source is identical in aligned detectors , this term serves to increase the sensitivity of the overall detection statistic .",
    "however , it disappears when the sl approach is used for even infinitesimally misaligned detectors .",
    "this is counterintuitive since we expect the cross - correlation term to remain important for small misalignments .",
    "the origin of the two detector paradox is that all waveforms for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are allowed as solutions when maximizing the likelihood even though some of them would be improbable in that they will produce widely different responses in two nearly aligned detectors .",
    "it follows that this problem can be solved by removing such improbable waveforms from the space of allowed solutions .",
    "in kmrm , this was achieved by imposing certain constraints on the space of waveforms yielding the class of constraint likelihood methods .",
    "modifying the likelihood functional with a waveform dependent weight factor , such as a bayesian prior  @xcite , is another way of suppressing undesirable solutions . in the following we use the term",
    " restriction \" to encompass all approaches that remove improbable solutions or reduce their influence .",
    "the non - trivial aspect of setting up restrictions is that the performance of the resulting statistic must not be degraded and , if possible , should be better than the sl approach .",
    "additionally , the restrictions must be applicable to all astrophysical burst sources otherwise the resulting statistic will be better for a particular type of source but may be worse for others . if sufficiently reliable knowledge for a particular class is available , then it can be used  @xcite as an additional set of restrictions to further enhance sensitivity .",
    "the constraints proposed in kmrm ( see section  [ 2dp ] ) satisfy the above condition , namely independence from assumptions about source dynamics .",
    "simulations show that constraint likelihood methods perform significantly better than sl , especially in reconstructing the sky position of a burst source . however , the constraints used were a first example and are not necessarily unique or optimal .",
    "it is important to investigate independent avenues of formulating generic restrictions in order to gain more insight into this promising approach to network analysis .",
    "we investigate the issue of generic restrictions from a physical point of view .",
    "it is found that the more improbable a set of waveforms @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the faster is the change in detectability of the corresponding source as a function of sky position . by measuring the rate of change of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as a function of sky position , therefore",
    ", we can restrict solutions that are undesireable in the maximization of the lr .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the detection statistic that results from the above restriction performs roughly the same as constraint likelihood methods .",
    "however , there exist important qualitative differences in how the two methods process data .",
    "for example , unlike constraint likelihood , the divergence from sl of the method introduced here depends on the actual data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the standard likelihood method in section  [ netanalysis ] , establishing our basic notation and conventions on the way .",
    "section  [ 2dp ] contains a discussion of the two detector paradox .",
    "section  [ snrvar ] considers the snr variability of signals , discusses how it affects their detectability and defines a measure for it .",
    "section  [ penlike ] contains the derivation of the detection statistic and source parameter estimators that result from incorporating snr variability .",
    "results from simulations are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "we fix a cartesian coordinate system with its origin at the center of the earth , @xmath13 axis pointing at the north pole and some arbitrary convention for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 axes",
    ". this will be our fiducial frame of reference .",
    "let the sky position of an incoming gw signal in this frame be denoted by @xmath2 , the polar angle , and @xmath16 , the azimuthal angle .",
    "an incoming gw signal is most conveniently expressed in the transverse traceless ( tt ) guage  @xcite associated with the source direction .",
    "the @xmath13 axis of the tt frame is oriented along the direction to the gw source .",
    "we adopt the convention that the @xmath14 axis of the tt gauge lies in the plane formed by the tt frame @xmath13 axis and the @xmath13 axis of the fiducial frame .",
    "the gw signal is specified by its two independent polarization components @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the tt frame .    in this paper",
    ", we take into account the different orientations and geographic locations of currently operating interferometric detectors but treat them as identical in sensitivity . for instance",
    ", a geo detector in the paper will mean a detector having the same location and orientation as geo600 but with sensitivity similar to that of ligo detectors .",
    "this simplifies the algebra considerably whithout altering the main result which is the relative comparison of methods .    since real data",
    "is digital , we shift to the discrete time domain and from here on denote any time dependent quantity @xmath17 as @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the sampling interval . a finite sequence of time samples @xmath21,g[1],\\ldots , g[m-1]\\}$ ] will be denoted by @xmath22 .",

    "[ ndetresponse ] , @xmath59 is a vector that depends on only two parameters @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath59 must lie in a two dimensional plane determined completely by the antenna pattern functions of the detectors and passing through the origin of @xmath60 .",
    "though the maximization of @xmath61 is restricted to @xmath64 lying in the response plane , in the maximum likelihood ratio approach there are no further constraints on the choice of @xmath64 within this plane .",
    "we call the method of maximizing @xmath61 over @xmath65 with no further restrictions as the standard likelihood ( sl ) method  @xcite .",

    "however , the same procedure , when carried out for even infinitesimally misaligned detectors , yields @xmath77 that has no cross - correlation term , @xmath78 this clearly violates what one expects on physical grounds since the cross - correlation term should remain a useful discriminant against noise when the detectors are only infinitesimally misaligned .",
    "however , for the class of probable waveforms , the sl statistic becomes less sensitive than one in which a cross - correlation term is added by hand .",
    "thus , the sl approach fails to deliver a physically acceptable detection statistic in the two detector case .",
    "following kmrm we call this problem the two detector paradox .",
    "the origin of the two detector paradox lies in the maximization of @xmath61 over all waveforms , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , including those that can produce very different responses @xmath79 and @xmath80 for even infinitesimally misaligned detectors .",
    "such waveforms can lead to small or even zero cross - correlation between the responses .",
    "physical intuition suggests that such waveforms should be imrobable .",
    "mathematically , however , such waveforms are allowed since the matrix @xmath42 is invertible , even if it is nearly singular , and some @xmath11 and @xmath12 can always be obtained for any given @xmath79 and @xmath80 . as a result , the sl approach  throws \" out the cross - correlation term since this term can now contribute pure noise .",
    "geometrically , the two detector paradox comes about because the data vector @xmath68 lies in the response plane and the sl approach does not constrain the choice of @xmath65 in this plane .",
    "hence , the solution @xmath81 that removes cross - correlation is an allowed one in this case .",
    "this suggests that restricting the allowed solutions in the response plane can resolve the two detector paradox .",
    "the sl detection statistic recovers pair - wise cross - correlations in the case of three or more misaligned detectors since @xmath68 now lies outside the response plane .",
    "however , the two detector paradox is just an extreme manifestation of a problem that occurs for any arbitrary network : depending on the geometry of the network , some solutions are improbable and their inclusion in the maximization of the lr reduces its sensitivity .",
    "though our physical intuition suggests that an infinitesimal misalignment between two detectors should not result in very different responses @xmath82 , this does not forbid the existence of such sources .",
    "as discussed above , mathematically , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be completely arbitrary and , in particular , can be such that @xmath79 is very different from @xmath80 .",
    "however , we expect such sources to be improbable .",
    "is their a quantitative basis for our expectation ? in this section we show that , indeed , there is a natural argument that  probable \" gw sources , for which @xmath83 , should occur more often than  improbable \" ones . note that the categorization of a source as probable or improbable also depends on the mutual alignment of detectors .",
    "for example , two detectors oriented at @xmath69 to each other can often have very different responses for the same source .",
    "as shown below , our argument takes this factor into account .",
    "we first present the two detector case and then consider an arbitrary network .",
    "consider a gravitational wave source located at @xmath84 with signal polarization components @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "let the detector response vector be @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "now consider an identical source located at @xmath87 . by this",
    "we mean that the fiducial frame , along with the gw source , be rotated rigidly leaving the detectors in their original place .",
    "this leads to a network response @xmath88 $ ] that is related to @xmath44 $ ] by , @xmath89 now , assume that we use matched filtering  @xcite to detect the source at the instant @xmath71 .",
    "thus , our detection statistic will be @xmath51.{\\bf s}[k]$ ] and @xmath51.{\\bf s}^\\prime[k]$ ] for the two sources respectively .",
    "the detectability of a source under matched filtering is measured by the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , @xmath90 , defined as the ratio of the mean of the detection statistic to its standard deviation .",
    "for the two sources above , the respective snr will be @xmath91\\|$ ] and @xmath92\\|$ ] .",
    "note that we are considering a more restricted version of matched filtering than the conventional one in which the detection statistic would be @xmath93.{\\bf s}[k]$ ] and the snr would be @xmath94\\|^2 $ ] .",
    "we return to this point later in this section .",
    "we denote the relative difference in snr for the two source locations as , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the unit vector oriented along @xmath65 . for small displacements , @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ", we get , @xmath99 the norm of the gradient @xmath100^{1/2}\\ ; , \\label{normsnrgrad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath101 and @xmath102 , is a convenient measure of the variability of the snr of a source as a function of its location .",
    "a high value of @xmath103 implies that the source would have to occur at very special positions on the sky to be detectable .",
    "this is because if it has an snr above some detection threshold at one location , it may rapidly fall below it if it were to occur at a slightly different location .",
    "consider two classes of sources , class a with a large associated @xmath104 and class b with low values of the same .",
    "assume that events from both classes occur with the same comoving rate and that they have the same distribution on the sky .",
    "then , due to the rapid fluctuation of the snr for source class a , the area of the sky over which its members will be detectable would be significantly less than that of class b. it follows that the observed rate of the class a sources would be much reduced in comparison to class b. therefore , even though the two sources may be equivalent in terms of , say , the energy emitted in gws , the high snr variability source would be detectable less often . since a larger volume of space would required to detect such sources , it will naturally be harder to detect at a given false alarm rate .",
    "we thus arrive at the main point of this section . given a pair of misaligned detectors",
    ", we should include only those responses @xmath65 in our search for the maximum of the lr for which @xmath105 is low in some well defined sense . in this way , the detectability of sources with an intrinsically low observable rate will be reduced but that of more frequently observable sources will be enhanced .",
    "it is important to note that the above argument does not require any prior assumptions about the astrophysics of sources .",
    "also note that @xmath106 depends only on the orientation of @xmath65 and not its magnitude .",
    "that is , it is only concerned with the shape of the waveforms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and not the distance to the source .",
    "figure  [ misalign_1 ] shows polar plots of @xmath104 as a function of @xmath96 for fixed @xmath2 , @xmath16 and different detector alignments .",
    "it is assumed that the detectors are colocated at the origin of the fiducial frame and coplanar with angles between their respective x arms of @xmath107 .",
    "the antenna patterns are , in this case , @xmath108 each plot is over all orientations of the detector response vector @xmath96 .",
    "first , we see that for almost coaligned detectors , @xmath109 , if we limit the search for the maximum of @xmath61 ( c.f . ,",
    ".  [ llrsummand ] ) over @xmath96 such that @xmath110 , say , then only detector responses with orientation very close to the @xmath69 and @xmath111 line will be allowed .",
    "this means that the instantaneous response in the two detectors should be nearly equal . from this example",
    ", we see that waveforms with low snr variability are also the ones that lead to nearly identical responses in the two detectors and , as discussed above , are the ones which have relatively higher chances of being detected .",
    "this bears out our physical intuition that sources that produce very different responses in nearly aligned detectors should be rare .",
    "as @xmath107 is increased , one sees that not only does @xmath112 decrease but that it also approaches the same value for all orientation and , hence , all orientations of @xmath96 are now allowed .",
    "the pattern opens up fully when the detectors are at @xmath69 to each other .",
    "as @xmath107 approaches @xmath113 , the responses are again increasingly restricted around the @xmath114 lines .",
    "though fig .",
    "[ misalign_1 ] shows that snr variability is a natural measure for restricting the orientation of @xmath96 , the particular measure @xmath105 allows both @xmath114 lines as the locii of restriction . for nearly aligned detectors ,",
    "however , we expect detector responses to be in - phase which means that the responses should lie in the vicinity of the @xmath115 line .",
    "we introduce another function , @xmath116 , that is also a measure of snr variability but has better properties in this respect .",
    "@xmath117 in fact , from the cauchy schwartz inequality , it follows that @xmath118 hence , @xmath116 is an upper bound on snr variability .",
    "figure  [ misalign_2 ] shows polar plots of @xmath119 for fixed @xmath2 , @xmath16 and different misalignment angles @xmath107 .",
    "now , for small misalignement ( @xmath109 ) , one sees that only responses along the @xmath115 line are allowed while for misalignement close to @xmath113 , only responses that are close to @xmath111 are allowed .",
    "it makes sense , therefore , to use @xmath116 as a measure of snr variability instead of @xmath105 .        in the above discussion , we considered the detection of a signal at a single instant using a matched filter , leading to the detection statistic @xmath51\\cdot{\\bf s}[k]$ ] .",
    "burst signals can last over several sampling intervals and , in general , the detection statistic would in fact be a sum @xmath93\\cdot{\\bf s}[k]$ ] over a range of @xmath71 . in this case ,",
    "a high snr variability response @xmath44 $ ] can be balanced by a very low variability response @xmath120 $ ] at some other instant , thus leading to a low variability for the overall snr @xmath121^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this would allow a broader range of signals to be used for maximizing the overall likelihood @xmath66 ( c.f . , eq .",
    "[ loglratio ] ) .",
    "our choice of using instantaneous snr variability is simply a conservative one since signals with low instantaneous snr variability will necessarily have low variability of their overall snr .",
    "moreover , as discussed earlier , physical intuition suggests that the responses in closely aligned detectors should be nearly identical at each instant of time and not just on the average .",
    "we will now generalize the snr variability measure @xmath119 , introduced in eq .",
    "[ snrgrad_upper ] , to the case of an arbitrary network of detectors .",
    "the relative difference in the observed snr of the same source between two positions @xmath122 and @xmath87 is , @xmath123 as before , for a small displacement of the source , @xmath124 and our measure of snr variability will be defined as , @xmath125 here , @xmath96 is a unit vector in the @xmath126 space but lying in the response plane .    for algebraic simplicity ,",
    "it is convenient to express the response vector @xmath65 in terms of a basis in the response plane rather than the full @xmath126 space . in order to do so",

    "@xmath167 note that when @xmath168 , we recover the standard likelihood ratio statistic @xmath67 wherein the solution for @xmath64 is the data @xmath162 projected on the 2d response plane .",
    "also , the importance of the penalty term diminishes as @xmath169 . if a signal is present , the latter increases with an increase in the instantaneous signal amplitude .",
    "hence , whenever the signal amplitude is strong enough , the effect of the penalty term is reduced at that instant and the wave form estimators @xmath164 and @xmath163 converge to the sl estimates .",
    "the term @xmath170 , which is always positive by definition , is a measure of how misaligned the detectors in a network are .",
    "this difference is reduced with an increase in misalignment , hence reducing the effect of the penalty term .",

    "fig  [ eval_diff ] also shows the ratio of the differences in eigenvalues for the two networks .",
    "it is clear that the difference in eigenvalues for the first network , which consists of nearly aligned detectors , is larger than that for the second network over a large fraction of the sky .",
    "+        the statistic @xmath165 solves the two detector paradox by continuously bridging the aligned and misaligned detectors cases . from eq .",
    "[ psi_solution ] , it is clear that as @xmath170 increases , i.e. , as the detectors become more aligned , the denominator increases in the negative direction while the numerator , @xmath172 , stays the same .",

    "[ gamma_psi ] , the penalty function @xmath175 has its lowest value for @xmath176 .",
    "this is the direction in the response plane along which all the responses in a network get oriented as the detectors are aligned .",
    "therefore , with progressive alignment of the detectors in a network , the solution @xmath164 is forced towards equal responses in all detectors , thus leading smoothly into the completely aligned case .",
    "in contrast , for the standard likelihood statistic @xmath177 ( @xmath178 when @xmath168 ) , there exists a fundamental discontinuity between the solutions for aligned and misaligned cases : for the aligned case @xmath179 , while @xmath180 for the misaligned case .",
    "finally , the penalty term , @xmath175 , depends only the direction of the instantaneous network response vector @xmath65 .",
    "it does not restrict its length .",
    "hence , the magnitude of @xmath65 at two distinct time instants can be arbitrarily different .",
    "thus , even white noise response waveforms are allowed as solutions .",
    "the only requirement is on the mutual consistency of detector responses at each instant of time .      the penalized likelihood approach , eq .",

    "[ penalizedlr ] shows that @xmath185 acts as a prior .",
    "the difference is that this prior is not normalized in eq .",
    "[ penalizedlr ] but is instead multiplied by @xmath107 .",
    "of course , @xmath107 can be chosen to be the integral of @xmath185 over @xmath147 thus reducing the penalized maximization to a true bayesian analysis .",
    "the pmlr method was implemented in matlab  @xcite and its performance was quantified with the monte carlo simulation code previously used in  @xcite .",
    "we give a brief recapitulation of the simulation scheme : binary black hole merger waveforms from  @xcite are injected into short stretches of white noise , one waveform per stretch .",
    "the signals correspond to face - on binaries scattered uniformly on the sky with randomly selected polarization angles .",
    "the signals have a variable matched filtering snr due to their sky position and polarization , but an overall factor @xmath186 is used to scale the amplitudes of the two polarizations @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the sky - averaged snr of the injected signals is approximately related to g as @xmath187 .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",

    "the true sky position of the source was @xmath189 , @xmath190 .",
    "the best estimates for sky position ( in degrees ) were ( 1 ) @xmath191 , @xmath192 for sl and ( 2 ) @xmath193 , @xmath190 for pmlr and constraint likelihood .",
    "note that , compared to sl , the sky maps for constraint likelihood and pmlr are less noisy and show more contrast between the region in which the signal is located and the rest of the sky .",
    "the simulation code finds out the fraction of all injected binaries detected by the pmlr ( or other ) method .",
    "the detection statistic for all methods is the maximum value over the respective skymap ( e.g. fig  [ comp_1 ] ) .",
    "fig  [ roc_curves ] shows the receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) for sl , constraint likelihood ( both hard and soft constraint ) and pmlr ( with @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) .",
    "the measured fraction of detected signals is plotted against the false alarm rate corresponding to the detection threshold used .",
    "it is clear from the figure that pmlr can vary continuously in performance , ranging from sl for low values of @xmath107 to the hard constraint method for high values .",
    "the simulation code also estimates the error in sky position reconstruction .",
    "[ snrgrad_comp_angeff ] shows the fraction of the injected signals that were detected within 8 degrees of their true position , for a range of the scale factor @xmath186 .",
    "the pmlr method ( @xmath188 ) has practically the same performance as the hard constraint method and both perform somewhat better than the soft constraint method .",
    "the performance of sl , however , is significantly worse than all the other methods .",
    "this can also be seen qualitatively in the sky maps of the various methods ( fig .",
    "[ comp_1 ] ) where the sl sky map always has less  contrast \" around the true signal location compared to the constraint likelihood and pmlr methods .     the fraction of signals detected within @xmath196 of their true positions . as the signal snr decreases ,",
    "all methods lose both detection efficiency and incur large errors in direction estimation . at the same time , as the snr increases , all methods converge to the true signal location in almost all cases .",
    "the difference between the methods is , therefore , maximum for intermediated snrs . ]",
    "there exists a serious problem , called the two detector paradox , in the formal application of the standard likelihood method to the detection of burst gw signals .",
    "we resolve this problem by imposing a restriction on the detector responses allowed as candidate solutions for maximizing the likelihood functional .",
    "the restriction is imposed through a penalizing function that measures the variability of the snr of a candidate solution when the corresponding source is displaced slightly on the sky .",
    "high snr variability sources lead to very different detector responses even when the detectors are closely aligned .",
    "the standard likelihood method allows such sources as perfectly valid candidate solutions . however , such abnormal sources have an inherently reduced observability . the proposed method ( pmlr )",
    "sacrifices the detectability of suuch sources while boosting the sensitivity and sky position reconstruction accuracy for normal signals .",
    "pmlr contains a free parameter , the penalty factor @xmath107 . for @xmath168 pmlr",
    "simply reduces to the sl method .",
    "however , method is not very sensitive to the exact value of @xmath107 , and the sky map of the likelihood converges rapidly as @xmath107 is made large .",
    "the role of @xmath107 needs to be investigated further .",
    "results from numerical simulations show that the performance of the pmlr method can be tuned , using @xmath107 , to vary over the range covered by the standard likelihood and the constraint likelihood methods introduced in kmrm . for the type of source population used in the simulations , a high value of @xmath107 yields the same performance as the hard constraint method .",
    "the roc curves are mildly better compared to standard likelihood but the accuracy of source direction reconstruction is significantly better .",
    "pmlr is also related to the bayesian approach .",
    "work in the latter direction has focussed on using priors that suppress candidate solutions that are not smooth .",
    "( this is equivalent to the requirement that the signals have a smaller frequency bandwidth than the noise . ) however , the penalty in pmlr is not based on the smoothness of signals in time .",
    "it is on signals that lead to widely different responses in nearly aligned detectors . in particular ,",
    "a white noise burst signal is perfectly admissible as a candidate solution in pmlr .",
    "if smoothness constraints are desired , they can be added on to the pmlr restriction .    the approach introduced in this paper",
    "can be extended to include variability of observed snr as a function of source inclination to line of sight and the projected orientation of the source on the sky .",
