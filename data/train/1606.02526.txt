    "frequency synchronization of nonlinear interacting oscillators is one of the most common phenomena in nature .",
    "the phenomenon discovered by huygens in the 17th century was found out later in astronomy , chemistry and electronics , and manifests itself in various technical devices , environmental systems and nuclear physics .",
    "today , the direction of research has shifted to studying complex nonlinear dynamical systems with global interaction such as the cooperative dynamics of laser arrays and arrays of josephson junctions ; different forms of collective behavior of insects , birds , animals and human communities ; adjustment of heart rate and respiration , synchronization of electrical potentials of brain neurons and so on .",
    "recently new phenomena such as , for example , the partial synchronization , clustering and chimera states have been revealed .",
    "there is a large and rapidly increasing amount of literature on the collective oscillatory behavior among which one can find already classic books by kuramoto @xcite , strogatz @xcite , and pikovsky et al .",
    "@xcite , the review by asebron et al @xcite , and the recent brief but very informative review by pikovsky and rosemblum @xcite on the progress and perspectives of studies of globally coupled oscillators .",
    "despite the apparent diversity of the phenomena emerging in ensembles of interacting nonlinear oscillators , many of them can be modeled by a system of equations based on the stuart - landau one , which is closely associated with the phenomenon of the supercritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "y. kuramoto was the first to describe synchronization transition in oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems @xcite reducing the system of globally coupled stuart - landau equations to the system of the coupled phase oscillators known now as the famous kuramoto model .",
    "later the amplitude - phase dynamics was reinstated in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the mixed amplitude - phase dynamics significantly expanded a range of phenomena elucidated with the kuramoto model .",
    "depending on the ratio between the amount of interaction and the deviation of natural oscillator frequencies , new regimes of collective behavior such as amplitude death , quenched amplitude , oscillations with large amplitude , collective chaos and intermediate mixed states can arise .",
    "the system of equations describing the dynamics of globally coupled oscillators is a nonlinear system , and therefore , in general , is nonintegrable .",
    "however , under certain assumptions the system can be simplified and reduced to a solvable one .",
    "this occurs , for example , when the interaction is strong enough and the system of equations for globally coupled nonidentical stuart - landau oscillators is reduced within the self - consistent field approach to a system of equations for two macroscopic order parameters , the mean field and the amplitude - frequency correlator called the shape parameter . in our work",
    "we integrate this nonlinear system on an invariant manifold , present the complete classification of phase portraits and bifurcations , obtain exact expressions for the invariant manifolds ( a limit cycle among them ) and derive analytical solutions for arbitrary initial data in different regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ ordpar ]",
    "we present the dynamic equations for the self - consistent field and reduce them to the solvable problem .",
    "section [ diag&man ] provides a phase diagram of system ( [ mainsystem ] ) for the order parameters and analytical expressions for the invariant manifolds . in section [ analit ]",
    "we obtain the exact analytical solution of system and in section [ results ] we discuss the results .",
    "the model we are dealing with is a system of @xmath0 nonidentical nonlinear stuart - landau oscillators with a global dissipative linear coupling @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 ; @xmath3 is a position of the @xmath4-th oscillator in the complex plane , @xmath5 is the coupling strength and randomly distributed natural frequencies @xmath6 are characterized by the average frequency @xmath7 and the standard deviation @xmath8 . when the coupling is absent ( @xmath9 ) system ( [ hforms ] )",

    "the distance @xmath15 can be considered small , in @xcite system of equations ( [ hforms ] ) up to terms of the first order in @xmath15 was reduced to a closed system of equations for the macroscopic order parameters : @xmath16      \\displaystyle{\\frac{dw}{dt } } =      i{\\sigma}^2z + ( 1 - k - 2|z|^2 + i { \\omega}_0)w - z^2w^*.    \\end{array }    \\right . \\label{system1}\\ ] ] this system was derived by combining the averaging of original equations ( [ hforms ] ) with a perturbative approach based on the smallness of individual oscillator displacements from the position of centroid @xmath15 compared with @xmath17 along with neglecting higher - order correlators , which allowed one to omit the terms like @xmath18 as well as @xmath19 .",
    "though this derivation , formally speaking , is valid only for @xmath20 , the comparison of the results of @xcite with numerical simulations for original system ( 1 ) @xcite demonstrated that ( [ system1 ] ) reproduces qualitative features of the population dynamics in rather a wide region of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting system allows us to take into consideration the effect of the mismatch of oscillator phases on the dynamics of the centroid . presenting solutions of the system in the form @xmath23 and @xmath24 with real @xmath25 and @xmath26 and separating the real and imaginary parts , in a reference frame rotating at frequency @xmath27",

    "as seen from ( [ systemri ] ) , the plane @xmath29 is an invariant manifold , i.e. a manifold embedded in a phase space with the property that the trajectories that start out in the manifold remain in it . a comprehensive analysis of stability of this orthogonal manifold is cumbersome and out of the scope of the paper .",

    "the authors of @xcite used these equations to extract some analytical expressions , such as the values of the amplitudes in the fixed points and the quenching radius , for the qualitative and numerical description of the collective properties of the model . in our work",
    "we show that despite the nonlinearity system ( [ mainsystem ] ) can be integrated exactly .",
    "the main result of our work is an analytical solution of this system of nonlinear differential equations .",

    "let us now consider the following quantity @xmath52 : @xmath53 by differentiating it and substituting the expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 from system ( [ magicmainsyst ] ) we get @xmath56    - 2(a - b \\xi \\eta ) r s.    \\label{gamader1}\\ ] ] choosing the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 as @xmath59 one can conclude that the evolution of quantity @xmath60 is governed by the simple equation : @xmath61 thus , if at the initial moment of time the quantity @xmath62 , then it will be zero for all the values of @xmath63 , which means that the second order curve @xmath64 is an invariant manifold .",
    "when the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath21 belong to region i of the phase diagram the coefficients of ( [ cycle ] ) are positive and this second order curve , which is a stable limit cycle , is an ellipse . in such a way we have derived the explicit analytical expression describing the form of the limit cycle of our system ( [ mainsystem ] ) .",
    "as we move up along the line @xmath65 ( figure [ fig : phasediagram ] ) , the axes of the ellipse become smaller and smaller until at @xmath66 the limit cycle degenerates into the center , the @xmath67-point , which further transforms into the stable focus of region ii .",
    "this phenomenon is the well - known hopf bifurcation @xcite and we would like to note that our system allows analytical description of this bifurcation , which is often not the case .",
    "the line @xmath68 separates the regions with different types of the stable fixed point @xmath67 : the stable focus of region ii transforms into the stable node of region iii .",
    "this line is actually not a bifurcation border from the view point of the dynamics of system ( [ mainsystem ] ) , because the topology of its phase space is not changed .",
    "one more well - known bifurcation , the pitchfork one , takes place at the boundary between regions iii and iv : @xmath69 , where the stable node of region ii looses its stability and transforms into the saddle ( 0,0 ) and two stable nodes @xmath70 in region iv . in this region @xmath71 , but @xmath72 and expression ( [ cycle ] ) describes a hyperbola .    immediately after crossing the border between regions iv and v , in region v",
    "the saddle point @xmath67 transforms into the unstable node @xmath67 originating two saddles @xmath73 while the stable nodes @xmath74 remain . in region",
    "v both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are positive and line ( [ cycle ] ) is again an ellipse .",
    "however , contrary to region i , this ellipse now consists of four separatrices which start at the saddles @xmath75 and end at the stable nodes @xmath74 .",
    "thus , our simple calculations enabled us to establish the form of the separatrices ( the parts of the ellipse ) .    while approaching to the boundary separating regions v and i , @xmath76 , the angle between the straight - line invariant manifolds @xmath77 and @xmath78 decreases until , at the boundary , they merge into one unstable at the origin manifold @xmath79 along with the merging of the saddle and node points .",
    "this creates saddle - node points at the crossing with the ellipse .",
    "further in region i the origin transforms into the unstable focus , the linear manifold disappears and the elliptic manifold becomes the limit cycle . at the border between regions",
    "iv and v the pairwise saddle - node or heteroclinic fold bifurcation @xcite occurs .    near the codimension - two point @xmath80 ,",
    "where all the regions of the phase diagram of our two - dimensional system meet and the bifurcation borders cross , in high dimensional system ( [ hforms ] ) different dynamical regimes of the adjacent regions can mix . as was shown by the numerical study @xcite in the phase diagram of the original system ( [ hforms ] ) near this point there is a region of unsteady dynamical behavior .",
    "the main aim of this paper is stated as being the exact integration of system ( [ mainsystem ] ) or , with the use of the variables @xmath25 and @xmath81 , system ( [ magicmainsyst ] ) .",
    "the most straightforward way to do so consists of two steps .",
    "first , from ( [ magicmainsyst ] ) we can easy derive that the quantity @xmath82 satisfies a simple equation @xmath83 looking at this equation one can immediately note that there are two stationary solutions @xmath84 : @xmath85 that correspond to the linear invariant manifolds represented in figures [ fig : fig4][fig : fig6 ] ( in the cases i and ii parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are complex and these solutions do not any physical meaning ) .    integrating equation ( [ simplequation ] ) we can find that our variables @xmath25 and @xmath81 are related by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 are initial conditions of the problem .    the fact that the ratio @xmath82 satisfies the closed equation ( [ simplequation ] ) which can be integrated explicitly makes it possible to reduce the order of our initial system and complete its solution . in some sense equation ( [ solsimplequation ] ) plays the role of integral of motion ( energy ) in conservative systems .    to obtain @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath81 themselves we will present them in the following form : @xmath90 here @xmath91 is a function that has to be found , the constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 , related by @xmath94 , are determined by the initial conditions of the problem .",
    "this representation is a direct consequence of ( [ solsimplequation ] ) which is rewritten in a more symmetric form convenient for the further analysis .",
    "substituting ( [ commonform1 ] ) and ( [ commonform2 ] ) into equation ( [ magicmainsyst ] ) and performing some algebraic transformations we arrive at the equation for the function @xmath95 : @xmath96 this equation is the so - called abel equation of the first kind @xcite . using the substitution @xmath97 one can convert ( [ equatu ] ) into the linear equation @xmath98",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath99 where the constant @xmath100 should be determined from the initial conditions . that gives @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath103 here we assumed without breaking the generality of the solution that @xmath104 ( for a system of two ordinary differential equations of the first order we need just two arbitrary constants ) .",
    "thus , we have integrated our nonlinear problem and expressions ( [ commonform1 ] ) , ( [ commonform2 ] ) together with ( [ solutionv])-([beta ] ) give us its complete analytical solution . as one can see , the obtained solution has quite a compact form convenient for analysis .",
    "in this section we continue the description of the system behavior started in section [ diag&man ] . before proceeding",
    "further let us note that substituting ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) into ( [ vstar ] ) we can rewrite the constant @xmath100 as @xmath105 it turns out that @xmath100 is nothing but ?",
    "up to the sign < the quantity @xmath106 introduced in section [ diag&man ] .",
    "so , the constant @xmath100 indicates how far the initial point is from the invariant manifold @xmath107 at the initial moment .",
    "now let us consider the solution of the system in regions i and ii of the phase diagram .",
    "the common feature of these regions is that the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are complex : @xmath108 , and the constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 are related as @xmath109 . in this case",
    "the solution of the system can be presented as @xmath110 and @xmath111 where the following notations are introduced : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "now it is easy to see that in the first region , where re @xmath115 = re @xmath116 , the exponential term in @xmath117 vanishes as @xmath118 for arbitrary initial conditions and the solution becomes periodic which corresponds to the movement along the limit cycle .",
    "the movement along the limit cycle is described by ( [ complexform1 ] ) , ( [ complexform2 ] ) and ( [ complexv ] ) with @xmath119 .",
    "the period of circulation along the cycle is @xmath120 the plots @xmath121 in figure [ fig : fig2 ] ( ib ) present two typical solutions with initial conditions corresponding to the points of the phase portrait lying inside and outside the limit cycle .",
    "these solutions fit the so - called ` large oscillations ' which were found numerically in the previous works @xcite .        for parameter values in region",
    "ii re @xmath115 = re @xmath122 , the exponent in ( [ complexv ] ) tends to infinity at @xmath118 and our solutions , having a periodic component , tends to the point of the stable focus ( 0,0 ) ( figure [ fig : fig3 ] ( iib ) ) .",
    "a similar asymptotic behavior is observed in case iii : for all the initial conditions @xmath123 .",
    "the difference is that now we do not have oscillations .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that the stable point @xmath67 is the stable node and not the focus as in case ii ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "both the second and the third cases correspond to the amplitude death of @xcite when oscillations are quenched and the system evolves to the stable equilibrium .        in the case iv expressions ( [ solutionv])-([beta ] ) describe the phase - locked solutions of our system when asymptotically the population as a whole starts oscillate with the common amplitude @xmath124 ( see figure [ fig : fig5 ] ( ivb ) ) .        for the parameter values of region v of the phase diagram the solutions of system ( [ mainsystem ] ) are presented in figure [ fig : fig6 ] . though the asymptotic behavior of our system in the cases iv and v is visually similar these cases correspond to different geometry of their phase portraits which can be essential in more elaborated descriptions .",
    "corresponding to region v of the phase diagram ; the invariant manifolds are plotted with dotted lines.,width=566 ]",
    "in this paper we have integrate exactly the nonlinear system ( [ mainsystem ] ) describing the evolution of macroscopic order parameters , mean field ( [ z ] ) and the amplitude - phase correlator ( [ w ] ) , of the ensemble of @xmath0 nonidentical globally coupled stuart - landau oscillators ( [ hforms ] ) .",
    "expressions ( [ commonform1 ] ) , ( [ commonform2 ] ) and ( [ solutionv])-([beta ] ) represent the complete analytical solution of system ( [ system1 ] ) on the two - dimensional invariant manifold where the order parameters are orthogonal .",
    "we present a complete classification of phase portraits and bifurcations , obtain explicit expressions for invariant manifolds and derive analytical solutions for arbitrary initial data and different regimes .",
    "the obtained results confirm the qualitative and numerical description of ( [ mainsystem ] ) offered in @xcite and lead us to expect that analytical solutions can also be found in a less restricted situation , which will be the subject of future studies .",
