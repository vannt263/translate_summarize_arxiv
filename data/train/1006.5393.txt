    "in the last decades theoretical and experimental work on light scalar mesons with masses below @xmath2@xcite initiated an intense debate about their nature .",
    "quarkonia , tetraquark and mesonic molecular assignments , together with the inclusion of a scalar glueball state around @xmath3 as suggested by lattice simulations , have been proposed and investigated in a variety of combinations and mixing patterns @xcite .    nowadays evidence toward a full nonet of scalars below @xmath4 is mounting : @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "an elegant way to explain such resonances is the tetraquark assignment proposed by jaffe long ago @xcite .",
    "the reversed mass ordering is naturally explained in this way and also decays can be successfully reproduced @xcite . within this context",
    "the lightest scalar resonance @xmath8 is interpreted as a predominantly tetraquark state @xmath9[% \\bar{u},\\bar{d}],$ ] where the commutator indicates an antisymmetric flavour configuration of the diquark .    the lightest quark - antiquark state , i.e. , the chiral partner of the pion with flavor wavefunction @xmath10 , is then predominantly identified with the broad resonance @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that scalar quarkonia are @xmath12-wave states supports this choice . according to this picture quarkonia states , together with the scalar glueball ,",
    "lie above @xmath13 gev , see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .  therein .",
    "it is natural to ask how the scenario outlined here affects the physics at nonzero temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it is in fact different from the usual assumptions made in hadronic models at @xmath14 where the chiral partner of the pion has a mass of about @xmath15 mev .",
    "moreover , besides the chiral condensate , new quantities emerge : a tetraquark condensate and the mixing of tetraquark and quarkonium states in the vacuum and at nonzero @xmath16 remarkably , the mixing angle increases for increasing @xmath0 and the behavior of the chiral condensate is affected by the presence of the tetraquark field .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , on which these proceedings are based .",
    "we work with a simple chiral model with the following fields : the pion triplet @xmath17 , the bare quarkonium field @xmath18 , and bare tetraquark field @xmath19[\\bar{u},\\bar{d}]$ ] .",
    "the chiral potential was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath20where , besides the usual mexican hat , the parameter @xmath21 describes the interaction strength between the quark - antiquark fields and the tetraquark field @xmath22 in the limit @xmath23 the field @xmath24 decouples , and a simple linear sigma model for @xmath25 and @xmath17 emerges .",
    "the minimum of the potential ( [ pot ] ) is , to order @xmath26 :    @xmath27    and @xmath28 .",
    "the condensate @xmath29 is identified with the pion decay constant @xmath30 . note that the tetraquark condensate @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 : it is induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking in the quarkonium sector . shifting the fields by their vacuum expectation values ( vev s )",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 , and expanding around the minimum , we obtain up to second order in the fields @xmath35where @xmath36since the mass matrix has off - diagonal terms , the fields @xmath25 and @xmath37 are not mass eigenstates .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath38 and @xmath39 , identified with the resonances @xmath1 and @xmath11 , respectively , are obtained from an @xmath40 rotation of the fields @xmath25 and @xmath24 , @xmath41the tree - level masses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are @xmath42for the reasons discussed in the introduction , the bare tetraquark is chosen to be lighter than the bare quarkonium , thus : @xmath43 .",
    "the state @xmath44 is the predominantly tetraquark state , and the state @xmath45 is the predominantly quarkonium state .",
    "in order to investigate the nonzero @xmath0 behavior , we employ the cjt formalism in the hartree - fock approximation @xcite ; for specification of the method in the case of mixing we refer to ref .",
    "the cjt - formalism leads to temperature - dependent masses @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and a temperature - dependent mixing angle @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , both scalar - isoscalar fields have a @xmath0-dependent vev , for the quarkonium @xmath50 and for the tetraquark @xmath51 . for both fields the zero - temperature limits are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "when the tetraquark decouples ( limit @xmath23 ) , @xmath39 is a pure quarkonium and @xmath38 is a pure tetraquark state .",
    "the transition is crossover for @xmath54 and first order above this value .",
    "this is a well - established result , see e.g. ref .",
    "the fact that a heavy chiral partner ( i.e. , mass larger @xmath4 ) of the pion leads to a first order phase transition disagrees with lattice qcd calculations karschfodor .",
    "the inclusion of the tetraquark state changes this conclusion as shown in fig .  1 : in fig .",
    "1.a @xmath55 is fixed and the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath21 are varied . in fig .",
    "1.b the behavior of the quark condensate for fixed @xmath57 and @xmath55 is shown for different values of the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "one observes that for increasing values of the coupling @xmath21 the critical temperature @xmath58 decreases : while @xmath59 for @xmath23 , a value @xmath60 is obtained for @xmath61 .",
    "also the order of the phase transition is affected : when increasing the parameter @xmath21 , the first - order transition is softened and , if the coupling is large enough , becomes a crossover .",

    "the quark condensate @xmath74 drops and approaches zero , thus restoring chiral symmetry .",

    "2.b describes the state @xmath39 according to the following criterion : @xmath39 is the state containing the largest amount of the bare quarkonium state @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath79 it corresponds to the heavier state , for @xmath80 to the lighter one .",
    "a similar analysis holds for the dashed line referring to @xmath38 as the state with the largest bare tetraquark amount .    the mixing angle @xmath81 is shown in fig .",
    "3.c . at @xmath82",
    "the mixing becomes maximal and the angle jumps suddenly from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , @xmath85 . at @xmath82 the two physical states",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 have the same amount ( 50% ) of quarkonium and tetraquark .",
    "we have shown that the interpretation of @xmath1 as a predominantly tetraquark state sizably affects the thermodynamical properties of the chiral phase transition : the behavior of the quark condensate is softened rendering the order of the phase transition cross - over for a sufficiently large tetraquark - quarkonium interaction , and the value of the critical temperature @xmath86 is reduced , in agreement with recent lattice simulations karschfodor .    in future studies",
    "one should include a complete treatment of the other scalar - isoscalar states @xmath5 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 which appear in an @xmath89 context ( together with the inclusion of the scalar glueball ) .",
    "also , ( axial-)vector mesons shall be considered @xcite . nevertheless , the emergence of mixing of tetraquark and quarkonium states is general , and it is expected to play a relevant role at nonzero temperature also in this generalized context .",
