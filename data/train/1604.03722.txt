    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators ( tis ) such as hgte , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , and their alloys , are materials that are characterized by a narrow band gap in the electronic band structure while their surfaces host non - gapped spin - momentum locked states@xcite .",
    "these helical surface states are topologically protected owing to the strong spin - orbit coupling in the material , and they mimic relativistic dirac electrons @xcite .",
    "tis have generated much interest , not only as fundamentally new electronic states of matter , but also for their potential future technological applications in the fields of spintronics and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "bismuth telluride ( bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ) is a 3d ti material , which has been investigated extensively @xcite .",
    "the conducting surface states of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 have been observed first using surface - sensitive techniques like angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) method @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at present it remains challenging to find unambiguous evidence of surface state transport in experiments on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 single crystals or thin films .",
    "this is mainly because the charge transport is dominated by bulk conductivity due to residual carriers , which complicates the direct exploitation of the remarkable properties of the surface states .",
    "recently , progress has been made in synthesizing a new generation of high - quality , bulk - insulating bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films using molecular beam epitaxy@xcite .",
    "we have been able to grow bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films on different insulating substrates ( sto [ 111 ] and al@xmath0o@xmath1 [ 0001 ] ) with the fermi level placed in the bulk band gap@xcite .",
    "combining different surface - sensitive in - situ characterization techniques , we demonstrated that the surface morphology and electronic band structure of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 are not affected by in - vacuo storage and exposure to oxygen , whereas major changes are observed when films are exposed to ambient conditions .",
    "independently , combined in - situ four - point probe conductivity and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments revealed the bulk insulating properties of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films with metallic surface states @xcite . in the work of hoefer  _ _ et al.__@xcite , the authors also demonstrated that short exposure to air causes the bulk conduction band to be filled with electrons and the conductivity is no longer determined by the surface states alone .",
    "these observations highlight the need to cap bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films in - situ before exposing them to air and other ex - situ contaminations in order to protect the surface states from degradation and unintentional doping .",
    "different studies employed epitaxially - grown amorphous layers of se / te@xcite or an evaporated layer of al @xcite as a protective capping layer for bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films whereas others used al@xmath0o@xmath1 grown with atomic layer deposition ( ald ) @xcite . however , it was noticed that the stoichiometry of the films was altered after removal of the te / se capping layer@xcite and that the ald - grown al@xmath0o@xmath1 layer can cause damage to the bi@xmath0te@xmath1 surface states@xcite .",
    "such damage decreases the surface mobility and generates a large number of impurity states which pin the surface chemical potential , a situation that will complicate an efficient electrostatic tuning of the fermi level @xcite . only recently , elemental te was identified as a suitable capping material for the protection of the topological surface of intrinsically insulating bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films@xcite , but systematic magnetotransport investigations of such capped films are needed .",
    "further , an insulating capping layer is preferable because it allows for the fabrication of nearly damage - free top gate structures @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be much more advantageous to develop a method for growing insulating capping layers with minimal damage to the surface states of intrinsically insulating bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films .",
    "on the other hand , as the materials issues are being solved , the focus should now turn to finding an efficient way of controlling the fermi level inside the bulk band gap .",
    "an effective gate control of topological surface states is highly desired for investigations of electronic transport properties in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films and related device applications @xcite . to - date",
    ", uniform gate - modulation of the carrier density and chemical potential over large areas and wide ranges has not been demonstrated in ( capped ) bi@xmath0te@xmath1 samples .",
    "our first demonstration of this capability in this work is an important step toward the implementation of large scale hybrid devices for quantum information or spintronics applications with bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films .",
    "we report bottom - gating results on in - situ capped , intrinsically insulating bi@xmath0te@xmath1 topological insulator thin films .",
    "we follow the growth recipe presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to obtain ti thin films with low densities of intrinsic carriers .",
    "first , we focus on determining the proper in - situ capping procedure of our bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films grown on different insulating substrates , namely al@xmath0o@xmath1 and srtio@xmath1 .",
    "we use two different capping materials : an al@xmath0o@xmath1 layer , grown by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) , and an epitaxially grown te layer .",
    "secondly , we report a systematic magnetotransport characterization of the in - situ capped films by studying the bottom - gate dependence of the sheet resistance , 2d carrier density ( @xmath4 ) and weak antilocalization behavior . here",
    ", we used the srtio@xmath1 substrate as the back - gate dielectric .",
    "lastly , we compare the transport characteristics of capped films with uncapped films of the same thickness and grown in the same conditions .",
    "dual evidence from both , extracted carrier densities and weak antilocalization ( wal ) phenomena , suggests that the fermi level is in the bulk band gap for the in - situ capped films since capping prevents the formation of native oxide and isolates the film from different extrinsic defects @xcite .",
    "the transport data on in - situ capped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films suggest that we can use the back - gate to tune the fermi level all the way from the bulk conduction band ( bcb ) into the topological surface transport regime , and further down into the bulk valence band ( bvb ) .",
    "these data reveal that capping the sample before taking it ex - situ for further electronic transport studies helps in preserving the surface states and avoiding unintentional doping induced by ambient conditions .",
    "the high - quality bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films used in this work were grown by molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on insulating substrates , sto[111 ] and al@xmath0o@xmath1[0001 ] .",
    "the growth procedure was similar to ref.@xcite . here , we compare magnetotransport properties of two samples of 15 nm thickness grown on sto .",
    "one sample was capped with amorphous al@xmath0o@xmath1 and the other with an epitaxially - grown te layer .",
    "the thickness of the protective capping layers of either material was @xmath5 6 nm .",
    "for the purpose of understanding the role of capping , control samples without the protective layer were grown under the same conditions for comparison . before and after capping , the surface condition of films were checked using x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) . for in - situ surface elemental characterization and detection of any te / bi excess in our films",
    ", we used xps . figure  [ fig : surfacecheck ] shows the xps spectra of the pristine ( blue ) film . only the bi and te peaks are resolved with no appearance of extra peaks , confirming that the film is clean without contaminations .",
    "the analysis of the high resolution scans around the te @xmath6 and bi @xmath7 peaks for the pristine bi@xmath0te@xmath1 film ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : surfacecheck ] and ) reveal narrow and symmetric core level lines , signaling the absence of te or bi excess in our film .",
    "the surface chemical stoichiometry was determined following the procedure presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and the te : bi ratio was determined to be 1.497@xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : surfacecheck ] shows a typical rheed pattern of the pristine bi@xmath0te@xmath1 film before being capped with an al@xmath0o@xmath1 layer .",
    "the sharp rheed streaks are indicative of a high - quality film with smooth single crystalline domains . after depositing the al@xmath0o@xmath1 layer by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) , the rheed pattern of the same sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfacecheck ] for comparison .",
    "for the deposition , the films had been transferred to the pld chamber without breaking high vacuum ( hv ) conditions as the pld system is connected to the growth chamber via an hv distribution chamber .",
    "the capping layer was deposited at room temperature in argon flow ( 40 sccm ) at a background pressure of 1@xmath9 mbar using a laser energy density of 2.75 j/@xmath10 . in order to minimize the degradation of the bi@xmath0te@xmath1 surface states due to high energy ionic bombardment of the sample surface during the pld process",
    ", the sample holder was placed at a relatively far distance ( @xmath11 mm ) from the target material .",
    "after the al@xmath0o@xmath1 deposition , only the oxygen and aluminum peaks were resolved in the xps spectrum ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfacecheck ] ) .    for samples capped with te ,",
    "the capping was also performed at room temperature , immediately after the growth of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films in the mbe growth chamber without breaking the ultra - high vacuum conditions .",
    "the surface elemental composition of these films was also investigated using xps . only bi and te peaks are resolved in the xps spectra before and after the deposition of the 6 nm te capping layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : surfacecheck ] ) .",
    "the intensities of the bi core levels in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 are observed to decrease after the capping step . from the analysis of the high resolution xps spectra ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : surfacecheck ] and ) , the bi @xmath7 spectral intensity is determined to have reduced by @xmath5 70% without any changes in the lineshape or energy position .",
    "this indicates that the bi in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 is not chemically affected by the deposited 6 nm capping layer of te@xcite . on the other hand , the te @xmath12 and te @xmath13 peaks",
    "are slightly influenced by this capping procedure since their lineshape peak positions are shifted by @xmath5 0.8 ev toward higher binding energies upon the deposition of the te overlayer .",
    "this shoulder has been observed previously and was attributed to elemental te @xcite .",
    "the xps data on te capped film are in agreement with recent in - situ arpes and four - point probe conductivity data on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 films @xcite , which revealed that the surface states of the pristine bi@xmath0te@xmath1 samples are not affected by the te capping , thus suggesting the te capping method does not cause a doping of the sample .",
    "in order to investigate the electronic transport properties of capped films and to study the effect of the protective capping layer in magnetransport properties of in - situ capped and uncapped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films , we fabricated hall bar devices using standard photolithography methods and subsequent wet etching . for the etching step , we used a solution of nitric acid ( hno@xmath1 ) diluted with de - ionized water ( 1 hno@xmath1 :3 h@xmath0o ) .",
    "gold contacts were added in a subsequent lithography step . to achieve proper electric contact in the al@xmath0o@xmath1 capped samples , we removed the insulating layer in the contact area by etching the aluminum oxide with the same developer solution ( a base ) that we use for photolithography .",
    "figure  [ fig : transportcharacteristics ] shows an optical image of a typical hall bar device .",
    "we used the sto [ 111 ] substrate as the back - gate dielectric since it has a high dielectric constant at low temperature ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the same approach has already been used for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and ( bi@xmath15sb@xmath15)@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films , and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 nanoribbons also using sto [ 111 ] as the back - gate dielectric@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : transportcharacteristics ] depicts a schematic illustration of the bottom - gated thin film .",
    "electrical transport properties of the films were first characterized in the temperature range from @xmath16k down to @xmath17k using a quantum design ppms measurement system .",
    "later , we conducted magnetotransport measurements at different back - gate voltages in a dilution refrigerator at 100 mk .",
    "the measurements were performed using a standard lock - in technique with a small excitation current of 5 na .",
    "both , the sheet resistance @xmath18 and the hall resistance @xmath19 , were measured as a function of magnetic field at different back - gate voltages ( @xmath20 ) , in the range of @xmath21v .",
    "sweeping the gate voltage back and forth , we observed hysteretic behavior , probably due to the presence of impurity states that trap charges as has been suggested by previous studies@xcite . in order to keep consistency in the data ,",
    "all graphs presented here were taken by sweeping @xmath20 from positive to negative values .",
    "figure [ fig : transportcharacteristics ] presents the temperature - dependent zero magnetic field sheet resistance for two different capped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 films ( black : capped with al@xmath0o@xmath1 , blue : capped with te ) , and for uncapped film ( red curve ) .",
    "all three samples show metallic behaviour over the entire temperature range ; but the sheet resistance is lower in the uncapped film by about @xmath22 and @xmath23 at 2 k compared to the te and al@xmath0o@xmath1-capped films , respectively .",
    "this observation is consistent with recent in - situ arpes and four probe stm transport measurements on pristine , capped and exposed to air bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films @xcite .",
    "the decrease in @xmath18 was attributed to originate from exposing films to ambient conditions ; and corresponding arpes spectra on the same pristine and capped films proved that the fermi level is inside the bulk band gap prior and after in - situ transport measurements , which always showed metallic behaviour of the bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films@xcite .",
    "we first discuss the magnetotransport properties of the al@xmath0o@xmath1-capped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin film .",
    "the slope of @xmath19 indicates @xmath24-type carriers .",
    "it increases with decreasing @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath19 curves start to show nonlinearity below @xmath25v ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : transportcharacteristics ] ) .",
    "similar behavior has been reported in previous work on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and ( bi@xmath26sb@xmath27)@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films grown on srtio@xmath1 [ 111 ] substrate @xcite .",
    "we do not observe a reversal of the sign of @xmath19 in the entire magnetic field range in contrast to , e.g. , ( bi@xmath26sb@xmath27)@xmath0te@xmath1 samples in ref .  @xcite . in the case of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 thin films grown on sto [ 111 ] , the change of the sign in the hall signal",
    "has only been achieved at much higher magnetic fields and for large negative back - gate voltages  @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that the ambipolar effect is not observed within the accessible back - gate field range because of the `` m - like '' shape of the bulk valence band ( bvb ) structure of bi@xmath0te@xmath1  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : walbehaviour ] and related discussion below ) .",
    "the dirac point ( dp ) is buried inside the bvb , thus only @xmath24-type topological surface states carriers are accessible inside the bulk band gap , as it has also been recently suggested from gate - tunable transport studies of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 nanoribbon @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity in the hall resistivity curves below 50v suggests the coexistence of multiple charge carrier types .",
    "we extracted the low - field hall coefficients ( @xmath28 ) which are calculated from the slope of the @xmath19 curves for @xmath29 t ( see inset fig .  [",
    "fig : transportcharacteristics ] ) . it should be emphasized here that , in the case where @xmath19(b ) is nonlinear , a multiple band model approach should be taken .",
    "however , the discrepancies in carrier density and mobility of the high - mobility carriers ( corresponding to the low - field hall coefficient ) are small between one- and two - band fits to @xmath19 .",
    "we were not able to obtain a simultaneous fit to both components of the magnetoresistance data , @xmath30 and @xmath19 , within the framework of the standard two - band model . a full theory of band structure and quantum corrections to the conduction of 3d ti surface and bulk bands is still missing .",
    "thus , the 2d carrier density ( @xmath31 ) is extracted from @xmath32 , with the low - field hall coefficient @xmath28 as defined above , and @xmath33 the electronic charge .",
    "the mobility is calculated using @xmath34 at zero magnetic field .",
    "the response of sheet carrier density and sheet resistance of the al@xmath0o@xmath1-capped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin film to the applied back - gate voltage is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : transportcharacteristics ] .",
    "the first notable observation is the appearance of a maximum in the sheet resistance at v@xmath35v ( region ii ) , which is the first time , to our knowledge , that this behavior is seen in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "previously , it has only been observed in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and ( bi@xmath26sb@xmath27)@xmath0te@xmath1 single crystals and thin films @xcite , and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 nanoribbons placed on a srtio@xmath1 substrate @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to point out that the resistance maximum is not correlated with the depletion of the surface states at the dirac point ( dp ) , cp . refs .",
    "@xcite , as the dp is buried below the bvb maximum .",
    "we suggest that the downturn and saturation of the sheet resistance at negative gate voltages ( region iii ) is similar to what was observed in the measurements by lee _",
    "@xcite on bi@xmath36sb@xmath15te@xmath37se@xmath38 single crystals .",
    "the results were interpreted as an increase in interband scattering when the fermi level touches the bulk valence band ( see region iii in fig .  [",
    "fig : walbehaviour ] ) .    in total",
    ", we modulate the carrier density @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath2 in the accessible back - gate voltage range ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the biggest drop in carrier density is seen in region ii of fig .",
    "[ fig : transportcharacteristics ] .",
    "the lowest extracted carrier density is @xmath40 at @xmath41v with a corresponding mobility of @xmath42 .",
    "the low carrier concentration in the intermediate region strongly suggests that the fermi level is located in the bulk band gap , crossing only topological surface states .",
    "this is further corroborated by weak antilocalization measurements presented later .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 versus @xmath20 is observed to be linear as one would expect from a parallel plate capacitor model ( dashed line fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : transportcharacteristics ] ) .",
    "all added carriers participate in electric conduction in the intermediate @xmath20 regime , a behavior which is expected for surface states .    at large , positive and at negative back - gate voltages , the linear relationship does not hold . in region",
    "iii , the carrier density starts to increase slowly again as the bulk valence band contributes mobile carriers .",
    "the dirac point is buried deeper in the bulk valence band in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 samples which makes it unaccessible by electrostatic gating in the gate voltage range of our experimental setup@xcite . in region",
    "i , we add fewer high - mobility carriers by increasing the gate voltage .",
    "we attribute this to the onset of bulk conduction when the fermi level crosses the bottom of the bulk conduction band ( bcb ) .",
    "additional information about the carrier distribution and the scattering between transport channels is obtained from a measurement of the weak ( anti-)localization effect@xcite .",
    "the wal effect in tis has been studied intensively both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "wal is a quantum effect that is commonly observed in tis due to the spin - momentum locking resulting from strong spin - orbit coupling@xcite .",
    "the @xmath43-berry s phase of the topological surface states leads to destructive interference between time - reversed charge carrier paths , thus increasing the conductivity at zero magnetic field .",
    "the cusp - like wal maximum can be destroyed by applying an external magnetic field to the sample , which breaks the time reversal symmetry and @xmath44-berry s phase@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : walbehaviour ] gives the sheet conductance @xmath45 as a function of magnetic field for various @xmath20 measured at 100 mk .",
    "the @xmath46 data show sharp cusp - like maxima at zero magnetic field , indicating the existence of the wal . at high positive @xmath20 ,",
    "the wal effect is suppressed , containing parabolic background ( see inset fig .  [",
    "fig : walbehaviour ] ) .",
    "the suppression of wal at high @xmath20 can be due to either enhanced bulk conductivity when @xmath47 is located in the bulk or disorder induced electron - electron interactions in the system @xcite .",
    "the former scenario is much more likely in our samples since it is consistent with the @xmath31 analysis presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : transportcharacteristics ] and is similar to the behaviors reported previously in gating experiments @xcite .",
    "the wal behaviour is described quantitatively using the simplified hikami - larkin - nagaoka ( hln ) equation@xcite . in the limit of strong spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath48 ; where @xmath49 is the dephasing time , @xmath50 the spin - orbit scattering time , and @xmath51 the elastic scattering time ) , with a negligible zeeman term",

    "again , @xmath53 approaches @xmath92 for @xmath93  v suggesting a single conduction channel coupled by a conducting bulk or , alternatively , a weak localization correction of @xmath94 to the conductance from a decoupled bulk conduction band @xcite . as the bulk carriers are depleted , @xmath95 , suggesting that each surface acts as an independent coherent transport channel with comparable dephasing fields .",
    "to asses the role of the capping layers in protecting the topological surface states of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films , we compare transport characteristics from capped films to uncapped ones .",
    "we choose films of the same thickness ( 15  nm ) , which were grown under the same conditions .",
    "table  [ table1_2 ] summarizes the extracted low field carrier densities and the corresponding zero magnetic field mobilities for the two capped samples ( sample iv and viii ) , we presented in this work , and of a capped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 film grown on sapphire ( sample - iii ) together with five other uncapped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 films grown on sto .",
    "clearly , we observe an improvement in the transport characteristics ( i.e. , lower intrinsic carrier densities while maintaining similar or high mobilities ) for the in - situ al@xmath0o@xmath1- and te - capped films .",
    "we demonstrated the effectiveness of in - situ capping for preserving topological surface states in bulk insulating bi@xmath0te@xmath1 thin films .",
    "for this purpose , we tested capping with al@xmath0o@xmath1 and te layers and found that both methods lead to a significant decrease in the measured carrier density by protecting the ti surfaces from adsorbates and other contaminations .",
    "we back - gated the samples using the srtio@xmath1 substrate as a dielectric , and we found that we were able to vary the carrier densities by @xmath96 carriers in the gate voltage range of @xmath97 . in samples with low intrinsic doping , this modulation is sufficient to move from a bulk - dominated transport regime to a bulk insulating sample with decoupled surface states , which is evidenced by a doubling of the weak antilocalization correction to the sample conductance .",
    "the ability to access ti surface states is an important step toward device applications in the field of quantum information and spintronics .",
    "we showed that thin film deposition techniques of ti materials with low intrinsic doping paired with protective capping of the topological surface and effective depletion of bulk carriers by back - gating provide a technological platform for large - scale integration of such electronic devices .",
