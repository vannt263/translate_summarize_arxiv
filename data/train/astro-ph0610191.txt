    "ukidss is the ukirt infrared deep sky survey @xcite , carried out using the wide field camera ( wfcam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) installed on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "data acquisition for the survey started in 2005 may .",
    "a prototype dataset , the early data release ( edr ) , was released on 2006 february 10 , and is described in @xcite ( hereafter d06 ) . the present paper defines the ukidss first data release ( dr1 ) , the first large release of ukidss survey - quality data .",
    "the data were released to the eso community on 2006 july 21 , and are available from http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa .",
    "ukidss is a programme of five imaging surveys that each uses some or all of the broadband filter complement @xmath4 , and that span a range of areas , depths , and galactic latitudes .",
    "there are three high galactic latitude surveys , providing complementary combinations of area and depth ; the large area survey ( las ) , will cover 4000 deg@xmath0 to @xmath1 , the deep extragalactic survey ( dxs ) , 35 deg@xmath0 to @xmath2 , and the ultra deep survey ( uds ) , 0.8 deg@xmath0 to @xmath5 .",
    "there are two other wide surveys to @xmath1 , aimed at targets in the milky way ; the galactic plane survey ( gps ) will cover 1900 deg@xmath0 , and the galactic clusters survey ( gcs ) 1100 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the complete ukidss programme is scheduled to take seven years , requiring @xmath61000 nights on ukirt .",
    "the current implementation strategy is focused on completing an intermediate set of goals , defined by the ` 2-year plan ' detailed in d06 .",
    "all magnitudes quoted in this paper use the vega system described by @xcite .",
    "depths , where not explicitly specified , are the total brightness of a point source for which the flux integrated in a @xmath7 diameter aperture is detected at @xmath8 .",
    "a set of five baseline papers provides the relevant technical background information for the surveys .",
    "the overview of the programme is given by @xcite .",
    "this sets out the science goals that drove the design of the survey programme , and details the final coverage that will be achieved , in terms of fields , areas , depths , and filters .",
    "the camera is described in detail by @xcite , and the _ zyjhk _ photometric system is characterised by @xcite , who provide synthetic colours for a wide range of types of star , galaxy , and quasar .",
    "details of the data pipeline and data archive will appear in irwin et al .",
    "( 2007 , in prep . ) and hambly et al .",
    "( 2007 , in prep . ) , respectively .",
    "the edr ( d06 ) , cited earlier , contains a sample of the data obtained in 2005 , and amounts to about one per cent of the 7-year plan .",
    "the edr represented a step towards regular release of survey - quality data , and occurred while the quality - control ( qc ) procedures were still being developed , and the pipeline finalised .",
    "the edr included all data from the first observing block , 05a ( 2005 april to june ) , and the dxs and uds data up to the end of september in block 05b ( 2005 august to 2006 january ) .",
    "the 05b dataset is substantially larger , and was processed with a later version of the pipeline .",
    "the current release , dr1 , includes all the 05a and 05b data .",
    "all the 05b data have been verified using the revised qc procedures that define ` survey quality ' .",
    "the 05a data , however , are included in dr1 , almost unchanged from the edr ( the minor changes are detailed in section 3.5 ) i.e. with the older versions of the pipeline and qc procedures . in a similar manner to the edr , two databases are provided in this release .",
    "the dr1 database includes all data where the full filter complement for a particular survey exists , and the dr1 + database ( which is a superset of the dr1 database ) includes all data that have passed qc . the next observing block , 06a , 2006 may to july , will be combined with the 05a and 05b data , and released in dr2 , early in 2007 .",
    "each ukidss data release will be accompanied by a paper summarising the contents of the release , and detailing procedural changes since the previous release .",
    "the edr paper , d06 , is a self - contained summary of all information relevant to understanding the contents of the edr .",
    "it serves as the baseline paper for technical details for all releases , and in the current paper only changes in technical details are documented .",
    "the terms edr and dr1 have been copied from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and the aims of the ukidss edr and dr1 papers are similar to those of the sdss edr @xcite and dr1 @xcite papers . besides providing details of the contents of the edr database , d06 includes relevant details of the camera design , the observational implementation ( integration times , microstepping ) , the pipeline and calibration , data artifacts , and the quality control procedures , as well as a brief guide to querying the archive .    in the current paper , in section [ projects ] we illustrate the fields surveyed on an all - sky map .",
    "in section [ update ] we detail differences in the implementation , pipeline and calibration , quality control , and archive procedures between edr and dr1 . in section [ dr1 ]",
    "we provide maps for each survey , illustrating the coverage of the dr1 release . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarise the contents of dr1 in terms of areas and depths , and other relevant quantities .",
    "in this section we provide an overview of the areas surveyed in dr1 .",
    "detailed coverage maps are provided in section [ dr1 ] .",
    "[ ukidss_survey_areas_dr1 ] illustrates the areas that will be covered in the 2-year plan .",
    "the las areas are shaded light grey , the gps areas are cross - hatched , and the gcs areas are shaded dark grey .",
    "the dxs targets are the four white rectangles with centres as follows ; xmm - lss ( 2@xmath9,@xmath10 ) , the lockman hole ( 10@xmath11,+57@xmath12 ) , elais n1 ( 16@xmath13,+54@xmath14 ) , and vimos 4 ( 22@xmath15,+0@xmath16 ) .",
    "the uds field covers a single tile , 0.8deg@xmath0 , and is just visible to the w of the dxs xmm - lss field .    for administrative purposes",
    "the surveys are divided into ` projects ' .",
    "the las , gps , and gcs projects which contain observations released in dr1 are illustrated in the figure . in the las , the data from projects las@xmath17 were observed in 05a , and were released in the edr , and are included in dr1 unchanged , with one proviso .",
    "this is that the algorithm for associating detector frames ( section [ archivesec ] ) , in merging sources across bands , has been refined .",
    "for some sources , in regions where frames overlap , a different choice of frame has resulted in revised photometry .",
    "new projects las@xmath18 were observed in 05b .",
    "the gps is divided into two main regions .",
    "the eastern wing lies mostly between @xmath19 and @xmath20 and was observed in 05a , in project gps1 .",
    "these data were released in the edr , and are included here unchanged ( with the above proviso ) .",
    "the eastern wing was also observed in 05b , in projects gps2 and 3 .",
    "the western wing covers the galactic plane between approximately @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and an additional region below the plane , the taurus  auriga  perseus molecular cloud complex .",
    "the western wing was observed in 05b in projects gps4 and 5 . in the gcs",
    ", the targets sco and coma  ber were observed in 05a in project gcs1 .",
    "these data were released in the edr , and are included here unchanged . in 05b the following targets were observed : pleiades , alpha per , tau.aur . ,",
    "orion , and hyades .",
    "coordinates for the complete list of gcs targets are provided in table 3 in d06 .    in the dxs ,",
    "the lockman hole was observed only in 05a , elais n1 and xmm - lss were observed in 05a and 05b , and vimos4 was observed only in 05b .",
    "the lockman hole data , and data taken in elais n1 and xmm  lss up to 2005 sept 27 , were released in the edr .",
    "these data are included in dr1 , with minor differences .",
    "firstly the qc for the 05b data has been redone , together with the ( later ) 05b data not included in the edr , using the revised procedures detailed in section [ update ] .",
    "secondly , in all fields the stacking has been redone for dr1 , having fixed two problems that were evident in the edr stacking ( d06 ) .",
    "the uds was only observed in 05b , and has been treated in the same way i.e. the qc for all the data released in dr1 was done in a homogeneous manner following the revised procedures .",
    "d06 contains details of the implementation , pipeline , calibration , quality control , and archive procedures applied to the edr data , and a glossary of technical terms . in this section we describe the differences between the procedures applied to the 05b data for dr1 , and those applied to the 05a data for the edr .",
    "as already noted , for the uds the edr included data taken up to 2005 september 27 .",
    "the dr1 includes additional observations , and the new stacked images reach substantially deeper .",
    "the total integration times on source , and depths reached in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the seeing , are summarised in table [ tab_uds_deep_stacks ] .",
    "as explained in section [ update ] the uds data are mosaiced .",
    "the individual @xmath25 microstepped detector frames are resampled onto a @xmath26 pixel grid , and the data are then stacked . in the wsa , the final frame",
    "is referred to as a _ mosaicdeepleavstack",
    "_ frame . unlike all other stacked data in the wsa , astrometry of the deep uds stacks uses tangential projection ( tan ) rather than the zenith polynomial projection ( zpn ) that is standard for wfcam .",
    "we have estimated the percentage completion of the surveys relative to the final 7-year goals set out in @xcite , by computing the product over all filters of the area covered and the summed effective integration times ( established from the depth achieved ) , in the dr1 + database . computed in this way",
    "the completeness of the surveys is as follows : las 6 per cent , gps 7 per cent , gcs 13 per cent , dxs 11 per cent , uds 4 per cent .",
    "overall , dr1 marks completion of 7 per cent of the ukidss final goals .",
