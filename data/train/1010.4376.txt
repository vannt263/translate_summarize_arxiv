    "2006 ) , where @xmath11 is the rotational velocity and @xmath12 is the velocity dispersion ; 2 ) high@xmath7 galaxies are more irregular and asymmetric in shape , which is not related with ongoing mergers ( shapiro et al .",
    "2008 ) ; 3 ) they show highly clumpy disks , typically with a scale of @xmath13kpc ( e.g. genzel et al .",
    "2008 ) ; 4 ) very high surface brightness of the recombination lines ( e.g. lehnert et al .",
    "there is no doubt that high@xmath7 galaxies are undergoing most violent formation and evolution .",
    "the `` heating '' mechanism of high velocity dispersion of clumps remains open , which is thought potentially to be responsible for the transportation of angular momentum of gas .",
    "turbulence driven by self - gravity instability is not favored by evidence that such flows are not able to produce the dispersion and emission via mergers ( lehnert et al . 2009 ) . however , there is increasing evidence for the turbulence excited by supernova explosion ( snexp ) of young massive stars during star formation from both numerical simulations or theoretical arguments ( wada & norman 2001 ; mac law & klessen 2004 ; wang et al .",
    "2009b ) and observations ( dib et al . 2006",
    "; lehnert et al .",
    "the strong correlation between the eddington ratios and specific star formation rates in type 2 agns implies the roles of snexp in exciting turbulence , which triggers an accretion flow to central smbhs ( chen et al .",
    "2009 ; see also watabe et al .",
    "2008 ) . in particularly , the strong correlation between the velocity dispersion and star formation rate density in both local ( dib et al .",
    "2006 ) and high@xmath7 galaxies ( lehnert et al . 2009 ) indicates the role of the star formation in triggering turbulence .",
    "we have to note also that turbulence can enhance star formation in term of the compressed density by shocks ( silk 2005 ) .",
    "anyway , snexp inputs energy into interstellar medium causing turbulence somehow .",
    "it has been realized that the star formation itself plays a key role in the formation of galactic structures .",
    "the well - known exponential disks of most s and s0 galaxies ( e.g. freeman 1970 ; wevers et al .",
    "1986 ) can be explained by that the gaseous disk is evolving like a viscose accretion disk , and the exponential structure reaches when the infalling timescale equals to the star formation ( lin & pringle 1987 ; lu & cheng 1991 ) , or by self - regulations of star forming galaxies ( dopita & ryder 1994 ; silk 1997 ) .",
    "tracing back the galaxies to high redshift , they must have been undergoing intensive star formation and similar to those galaxies at high redshift which have exponential disks today .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2009b ; hereafter paper i ) set up equations describing the self - regulating gaseous disk driven by snexp feedback for high redshift galaxies , and , fortunately , find that such a set of complex equations has analytical solutions if the star formation law is a linear relation with gas density .",
    "paper i shows the important roles of snexp in the secular evolution to supply gas to @xmath4kpc regions and find that the prominent feature of star forming galaxies in high@xmath7 universe is a natural consequence of turbulent viscosity driven by snexp .",
    "very recently , kumar & johnson ( 2010 ) extend the study of the roles of snexp in the transportation of fueling gas at @xmath4 kpc scale and confirm that snexp is an efficient way to transport angular momentum outward .",
    "the advantage of this self - regulation is that no external torque is needed to transport gas into inner region .",
    "it is obvious that the dynamical structure and morphology is highly time - dependent , which should be given by a self - consistent way .    on the other hand , coevolution of smbhs and",
    "galaxies has been generally formulated by the correlations between smbh mass and bulge luminosity ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) ; or dispersion velocity ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "great attempts of phenomenological models have been made ( e.g. granato et al .",
    "2001 ; colpi et al .",
    "2006 ) , however , dynamics of the coevolution is poorly understood so far .",
    "on the side of theoretical expectation , gaseous clumps in galaxies not only undergo star formation , but also will be partially delivered into the central regions of galaxies by snexp ( paper i ) . as a natural consequence of evolution of clumps , bulges are growing and smbhs do subsequently .",
    "the time lag of smbh activities relative to the starbursts is determined by the star formation itself . in principle , solutions of the time - dependent equations describing the dynamical structures of gaseous disk can present the whole story of the coevolution .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend studies of paper i in detail for the intensive evolution of dynamical structure and morphologies of high@xmath7 galaxies . in  2",
    ", we use the kennicutt - schimidt law to calculate the star formation rates , and incorporate the rates into the dynamics of the gaseous disk through the snexp excited - turbulence viscosity .",
    "growth of bulges and smbhs are discussed as well as the time lag of triggering smbh activities with respect to starbursts .",
    "photoionization model is presented in  3 for different geometries and conditions in the evolving gaseous disk .",
    "detailed applications to two high@xmath7 galaxies are given in  4 .",
    "we extensively discuss implications and future improvement of the present model in  5 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "spatial resolution of integral field spectroscopy is @xmath14kpc at @xmath15 , which is the maximum size of clumps resolved observationally ( genzel et al .",
    "2008 ; jones et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this size is still smaller than the characterized length of galaxies ( @xmath16 kpc ) , but the number density of the clumps are dense enough to approximate the system of clumps as continuum fluid .",
    "it is valid to use the equations of continuum medium , but we treat the gas as clumps in the photoionization model . in paper",
    "i , we derive a series of equations to describe the secular evolution of a gaseous disk by including feedback of star formation .",
    "we assume that turbulence excited by snexp of massive stars is driving the angular momentum outward , and mass dropout is happening due to ongoing star formation . actually",
    "the role of supernova - driven turbulence has been stressed by evidence of correlation between the dispersion velocity and star formation rates ( dib et al .",
    "2006 ; lehnert et al .",
    "2009 ) . for a convenience",

    "we neglect mass injection of stellar winds back to the gaseous disk or escapes of winds from galaxies .",
    "star formation process removes some angular momentum of gas , thus the conservation equation of angular momentum is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the viscosity torque , @xmath33 is kinematic viscosity , and @xmath24 is the angular velocity . combining equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we have @xmath34^{-1 }       \\frac{\\partial \\calg}{\\partial r}\\right\\}-\\sigsfr.\\ ] ] let @xmath35 , equation ( 3 ) is converted into a more concise form @xmath36 where the kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) law as @xmath37 is used and @xmath38 is a constant ( kennicutt 1998 ) could be different from the ks law ( gnedin & kravtsov , 2010 ) , but we ignore the difference for simplicity .",
    "the influence of the star formation law on the structure of the gaseous disk can be generally estimated by equations ( 15 - 17 ) and ( 19 - 21 ) .",
    "see a brief discussion in  2.2.6 . ] .",
    "this equation includes the star formation process which has two major effects : consume the gas and apply energy to make turbulence by snexp . imposing adequate boundary and initial conditions to equation ( 4 )",
    ", it will produce the structure of the gaseous disks .

    "the parameter @xmath0 is fixed for each model in this section .",
    "the ionizing fluxes just follow the star formation rates .",
    "the chabrier imf is used , the spectra thus keep a constant shape unless at the early stage of star formation and at the stage with a dramatic decrease .",
    "the differences of the ionizing spectra for case a and b result from the dynamical structure and the star formation history .",
    "we obtain dynamical structure of gaseous disk through continue medium equations , but we have to connect the averaged structure with clump structures . following vollmer & beckert ( 2002 )",
    ", we assume the turbulence with a spectrum of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the wave number of the turbulence .",
    "the clumps have a characterized size comparable with the turbulent length ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we have the characteristic time scale that turbulence crosses the clumps @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the characterized scale of the clumps , is equal to the gravitational free fall time @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the clump density and @xmath48 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the characteristic scale of clump is approximated by @xmath49 ( pringle 1981 ) .",
    "we have @xmath50 @xmath51 for case a and b , respectively . equation ( 33 ) shows @xmath52 for case a , @xmath53 tends to very large for two side edges of the ring since @xmath19 tends very small there .",
    "it is then expected that the two edges of the @xmath53 could be unphysical .",
    "clusters within @xmath54 usually have a typical size of 0.1 to 10 pc , which is much smaller than the height of the gaseous disk at radius @xmath30 .",
    "we introduce the filling factor @xmath55 , which is defined by @xmath56 @xmath57 for case a and b , respectively , where @xmath58 is the averaged mass density of gas as in continue disk and @xmath59 is the mass density of clumps .",
    "we will see @xmath60 ( in  4 ) if the density of clumps is determined by observations of @xmath61 lines ( lehnert et al .",
    "we note that the averaged ratio of cloud size to distance among clouds is about @xmath62 which is enough for the validity of the fluid approximation in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we further specify the geometry of the photoionized clump as illustrated by figure 6 .",
    "stellar winds , radiation and supernova produce a cavity of hot gas inside the clump by pushing the ionization front outward ( e.g. pellegrini et al . 2007 ; osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "we take the wind - nebular interacting surface as the illuminated surface with a radius @xmath63 .",
    "if the radiation pressure from stars ( @xmath64 ) is given , we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the luminosity of the stars in the cluster . in the following , we make an attempt to build up the physical connection between the photoionization process and the dynamical structure of the gaseous disk .",
    "the turbulent pressure balances the total internal pressures of the hot gas thermal pressure and radiation field pressure from stars , namely , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the thermal pressure of the hot gas . in principle",

    "we then we have @xmath77 .",
    "the photoionization is linked with the dynamical structure of the gaseous disk in light of equation ( 36 ) .",

    "stellar wind supplies the hot gas through heating of shocks produced by the interaction between the winds and medium of the inner surface .",
    "the power of the stellar winds is given by @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , @xmath94 is the mass of stellar wind , @xmath95 is the wind speed and @xmath96 is the timescale of the wind replenishment .",
    "considering the balance of the shock heating and free - free cooling , @xmath96 should be equal to the free - free cooling timescale ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , which is balanced by the free - free cooling @xmath100 .",
    "we then have the hot gas density @xmath101 and its thermal pressure @xmath102 , where we use @xmath103 ( pellegrini et al .",

    "this can be justified by equation ( 15 ) or ( 19 ) .",

    "the delayed smbh activities and cosmological evolution as further implications of the present model are also discussed briefly .      galactic - scale winds generally exist ( e.g. chen et al . 2010 ) and are thought to play an important role in evolution of galaxies .",
    "the present star formation rate density is much higher than the critical threshold of 0.1@xmath182 , above which is powerful enough to drive vigorous galactic - scale outflows in local galaxies ( heckman 2003 ) .",
    "the outflows are expected to play an important role in rendering a starburst `` self - regulation '' ( dopita & ryder 1994 ; silk 1997 ) supported by evidence of blue wings in rest - frame optical emission lines ( e.g. nesvadba et al .",
    "2007 ) . its influence should be incorporated into equations ( 1 - 3 ) , even in the energy equation ( 6 ) .",

    "2009 , see also hobbs et al .",
    "obviously , galactic winds will significantly lead to losses of mass and angular momentum , and hence change the evolutionary track of the gaseous disks .",
    "likely , the peak in @xmath184track appears in a further outer region in the presence of strong winds , even disappears .    the well - known metallicity - mass relation ( e.g. panter et al .",
    "2008 ) could be a result of galactic winds since less massive galaxies have shallower potential so to allow a stronger outflows .",
    "it is expected that outflows have influence on the photoionization through metallicity",
    ".      there is increasing evidence for the cosmological evolution of imf ( e.g. kroupa 1999 ; dave 2008 ) , implying that the @xmath131 may undergo cosmic evolution .",
    "top - heavy imf appears in high redshift and may lead to more violent evolution of high@xmath7 galaxies , and agn activities . cosmic evolution of galaxies should include the role of imf evolution in the dynamic equations .",
    "additionally , the correlation between metallicity and galaxy mass indicates that more massive galaxies are metal - richer ( tremonti et al . 2004 ; brooks et al . 2007 ;",
    "finlator & dave 2008 ) , namely , snexp rates may undergo at different levels in galaxy evolution in light of star formation efficiency depending on galaxy mass .",
    "obviously , massive galaxies already underwent many episodes of star formation in the past , resulting in metal - rich .",
    "the present paper focuses on the evolution of structure on a dynamical timescale of galaxies , though the imf determines the metallicity in a complicated way ( beyond the scope of the present paper ) , we do not include the cosmic evolution of imf and fix it for all radii in the present calculations .",
    "imf determines the snexp rates , which control the dynamical structure of galaxies , leading to the metallicity distribution in galaxies . as a result of photoionization ,",
    "metallicity govern the location of the galaxies in the bpt diagram",
    ". future work by including the evolution of metallicity will provide more strong constraints on theoretical model and unveil the histories of mergers .",
    "we simply assume @xmath131 as a constant with radius and time within a dynamical timescale of galaxies , but it should be a function of radius due to the stellar mass function and stellar evolution . for massive stars ,",
    "the hydrogen burning lifetime is given by @xmath185myr .",
    "for early phase of galaxy formation , the minimum mass of stars should be greater than @xmath186 , we have @xmath187 after inserting @xmath188 into equation ( 28 ) , where @xmath189 .",
    "these massive stars will dramatically change the very early phase of the gaseous ring .",
    "snexp rates as a function of time change @xmath131 by a factor of a few , may significantly change the results presented here .",
    "this is the reason why we use a smaller one @xmath131 for the second ring which is only of a few @xmath190yrs in both bx 482 and bx 389 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "it is well - known that inside - out growth of galaxy disks drives the gradients of averaged age of stars , colors and metallicity ( bouwens et al .",
    "1997 ) , however , m33 has a truncated disk at @xmath191kpc ( ferguson et al .",
    "2007 ) and the outer disk show an age increase with radius ( barker et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ; williams et al .",
    "2009 ) , indicating that the real growth of galaxy disks could be more complicated than the canonic version of inside - out growth .",
    "the present model only deals with the single episode of a minor merger or cold flows , and predicts three different fates of the merged gas as shown in figure 2_a_-2_c _ and figure 3_a_-3_c_. for a cosmological evolution of galaxies , their growth histories contain various populations of minor mergers or cold flows , and form composite gradients of age and metallicity . as interesting applications of the present model , histories of galaxy growths will be formulated from the population synthesis of minor mergers or cold flows .",
    "we use a presumed rotation curve in the paper , namely , we separate the gaseous disk from the stellar components of host galaxies .",
    "however , the inside - out growth of galaxies is governing the potential on cosmic timescale .",
    "we do not include the potentials of the gas itself and the newly formed stars .",
    "this is valid for a single episodic activity of star formation . for a cosmic evolution of entire galaxies",
    ", we should change the rotation curves with inclusion of the newly formed stars in the last episodic activity and then get the history of star formation in the entire galaxies step by step .",
    "we would like to point out the rotation curves ( equation 11 ) can be replaced by other forms under different potentials of galaxies .",
    "the present numerical scheme can conveniently include this .",
    "future applications to the large sins sample should modify the rotation curves for more complicated structures and emission .      delivering gas into the centers of galaxies by snexp will lead to coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies , which is established for local galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; richstone et al . 1998 ) and may undergo cosmic evolution in high-@xmath192 galaxies and quasars ( e.g. coppin et al .",
    "star forming galaxies at high redshift must undergo violent evolution : gas assembly , star formation , feedback from star formation and mergers and black hole activity .",
    "as a consequence , galaxies are growing fast at this epoch and may suffer from agn feedback , showing increase of agn duty cycle with redshifts ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ; 2008 ) .",
    "supermassive black holes are triggered by mergers ( e.g. roos 1985 ; carlberg 1990 ; wyithe & loeb 2002 ) , especially minor mergers ( li et al .",
    "2009 ) with a natural delay at a level of the transportation timescale following a star burst ( chen et al . 2009",
    "; paper i ; netzer 2009 ; kawakatu & wada 2008 ; davies et al . 2009 ; wild et al .",
    "2010 ) . a unified model for galactic evolution and agns is required to describe the coevolution , in which feedback from star formation and agn are included .",
    "the @xmath193equation statistically describes the coevolution of smbhs and galaxies ( wang et al .",
    "2009a ) , but it should incorporate dynamics of galaxies and accretion through transportation of angular momentum driven by snexp turbulence of young massive stars .",
    "in such a scenario , a delayed inflow to the central smbhs is triggered in this way ( di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al . 2006 ; chen et al . 2009 ; netzer 2009 ; kumar & johnson 2010 ) .",
    "we can in principle establish the dynamics of coevolution .",
    "we have a detailed extension of paper i to investigate the roles of snexp incorporated into the dynamics , for structures and emission of evolving gaseous disk with given potential of host galaxies .",
    "dynamical properties of such a gaseous disk is totally different from the classical gaseous disk with a constant viscosity , which simply diffuses into space .",
    "we show that snexp can efficiently transport gas into more inner regions and form a stellar ring or thick stellar disk .",
    "sbhm activity is then triggered with a lag of @xmath194yr relative to starbursts . a stellar ring or disk forms , or immigrates into bulges depending on the efficiency @xmath131 .",
    "for the case with high viscosity , the stellar ring formed from the secular evolution of the gaseous disk will immigrate into the bulge with dynamical timescale due to stellar friction . bulges and smbhs are jointly growing for high viscosity case whereas only galactic disks are growing for low viscosity .",
    "the model is able to produce the observed structures of high@xmath7 galaxies , including height , velocity dispersion and young stellar components .",
    "emission from the photoionized gaseous disk has been calculated through the simple stellar synthesis .",
    "uv photons are efficiently photoionizing the gas surrounding the star clusters and showing emission lines , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 .",
    "the model predicts relations of line ratios and h@xmath0 brightness , bpt diagram .",
    "we apply the models to sins sample , yielding the main features of the high@xmath7 galaxies .",
    "the consistency of the theoretical models with the observational properties sheds light of the roles of snexp in galaxy evolution",
    ".    future work to improve the present model are extensively discussed , especially the stellar evolution , galactic winds , initial mass function and the geometry of ionized clumps .",
    "we stress the factors of influencing the efficiency @xmath131 . when it is a function of time and radius , the structure and evolution of the gaseous disk will be changed somehow .",
    "the present model for single episodic event can be extended for successive multiple minor mergers or cold flows , whose initial conditions are different from each other .",
    "the composite models by including all episodes could explain the metallicity and age distributions in galaxies in the frame of the inside - out growth , or more complicated observational results .",

    "<S> high spatial resolution observations show that high redshift galaxies are undergoing intensive evolution of dynamical structure and morphologies displayed by the h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 images . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that supernova explosion ( snexp ) of young massive stars during star formation epoch , as kinetic feedback to host galaxies , can efficiently excite the turbulent viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate the feedback into the dynamical equations through mass dropout and angular momentum transportation driven by the snexp - excited turbulent viscosity . </S>",

    "<S> we numerically solve the equations and show that there can be intensive evolution of structure of the gaseous disk . </S>",
    "<S> secular evolution of the disk shows interesting characteristics that are 1 ) high viscosity excited by snexp can efficiently transport the gas from 10kpc to @xmath4kpc forming a stellar disk whereas a stellar ring forms for the case with low viscosity ; 2 ) starbursts trigger smbh activity with a lag @xmath5yr depending on star formation rates , prompting the joint evolution of smbhs and bulges ; 3 ) the velocity dispersion is as high as @xmath6 in the gaseous disk . </S>",
    "<S> these results are likely to vary with the initial mass function ( imf ) that the snexp rates rely on .    given the initial mass function , we use the galaxev code to compute the spectral evolution of stellar populations based on the dynamical structure . in order to compare the present models with the observed dynamical structure and images , we use the incident continuum from the simple stellar synthesis and cloudy to calculate emission line ratios of h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and h@xmath0 brightness of gas photoionized by young massive stars formed on the disks . </S>",

    "<S> two successive rings independently evolving are able to reproduce the main dynamical and emission properties of the two galaxies , such as , bpt diagram , relation between line ratios and h@xmath0 brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the observed relation between turbulent velocity and the h@xmath0 brightness can be explained by the present model . </S>",
    "<S> high viscosity excited by snexp is able to efficiently transport the gas into a bulge to maintain high star formation rates , or , to form a stellar ring close enough to the bulge so that it immigrates into the bulge of its host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a fast growing bulge . </S>",
