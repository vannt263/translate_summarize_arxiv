    "it easily follows from proposition  [ p - fp303 ] that the same is true for @xmath15    we now prove by induction on  @xmath373 that @xmath520 is purely infinite , starting with the smallest @xmath521 such that @xmath522 theorem  4.19 of  @xcite implies that @xmath523 is purely infinite , and by construction @xmath524 is finite , so @xmath525 is purely infinite by theorem  [ l : l3_0114 ] .",
    "suppose now that @xmath526 is known to be purely infinite for all @xmath527 if there is @xmath528 such that @xmath529 then we have a short exact sequence @xmath530 in which @xmath531 is purely infinite by the induction hypothesis and @xmath532 is purely infinite by the same argument as for @xmath533 therefore @xmath534 is purely infinite by theorem  4.19 of  @xcite .          [ e-2801cmpser ] adopt the conventions for graph c*-algebras described in chapter  1 of  @xcite .",
    "( warning : the papers @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite , all used below , use the opposite convention for the relation between the direction of the arrows in the graph and the definition of its c*-algebra . ) consider the following graph  @xmath469 :        let @xmath499 be its c*-algebra .",
    "the automorphism group of  @xmath469 acts on @xmath536 as described , for example , in the introduction to section  3 of  @xcite .",
    "there is a unique automorphism @xmath537 of @xmath469 of order  @xmath538 such that @xmath539 and @xmath540 for all @xmath541 and which sends the outer loop at each vertex @xmath542 to the outer loop at @xmath543 this gives an automorphism @xmath16 of @xmath499 of order  @xmath544    we now check the properties of @xmath545 we can check pure infiniteness using theorem  2.3 of  @xcite , but for this graph it seems easier to proceed more directly . the graph  @xmath469 satisfies condition  ( k ) as defined before examples  4.6 of  @xcite and is row finite .",
    "therefore theorem  4.9 of  @xcite applies .",
    "the set @xmath546 is a saturated hereditary subset of the vertices , so this theorem gives , using the notation there , a short exact sequence @xmath547 in which @xmath548 has a full corner isomorphic to @xmath549 both @xmath550 and @xmath551 are isomorphic to countable disjoint unions of copies of the graph with one vertex and two edges , whose c*-algebra is  @xmath552 therefore @xmath553 and @xmath548 is stably isomorphic to @xmath554 it now follows from theorem  4.19 of  @xcite that @xmath499 is purely infinite .",
    "the graph @xmath469 is not a disjoint union of nonempty graphs , from which it is easy to see that @xmath499 does not have a nontrivial direct sum decomposition .",
    "the sets @xmath555 for @xmath556 form an increasing sequence of finite saturated hereditary subsets of the vertices of  @xmath469 whose union is all the vertices of  @xmath25 the corresponding ideals each have finitely many ideals ( using theorem  4.19 of  @xcite ) . their union is dense in  @xmath536 since , by theorem  4.19 of  @xcite , the closure of the union comes from some saturated hereditary subset of the vertices of  @xmath25 therefore @xmath499 has a composition series in which all the subquotients have finite primitive ideal spaces .",
    "there are many other automorphisms of the graph @xmath469 in example  [ e-2801cmpser ] of order two .",
    "for example , one can modify @xmath537 by having it exchange the two loops at @xmath558 instead of acting trivially on them .",
    "one similarly gets two automorphisms of order two which act on the vertices via @xmath559 and @xmath560 one gets automorphisms of order four by specifying that for some values of @xmath561 the automorphism should send the outer loop at @xmath562 or at @xmath563 to the inner loop at @xmath564 or @xmath565          then @xmath567 is purely infinite and has a composition series whose subquotients have finite primitive ideal spaces by the same reasoning as in example  [ e-2801cmpser ] .",
    "there is an automorphism @xmath568 of order  @xmath538 which acts on the vertices by @xmath569 for @xmath541 and the corresponding action of @xmath13 on  @xmath61 is free .",
    "a proof related to that of theorem  [ t - compser-304 ] also gives the following result .",
    "the hypotheses are stronger than those of theorem  [ t - compser-304 ] , but still apply to a c*-algebra which is an arbitrary ( not necessarily finite ) direct sum of purely infinite c*-algebras with finite primitive ideal spaces , and to a purely infinite c*-algebra with a composition series indexed by @xmath570 and with simple subquotients .",
    "example  [ e-2801cmpser ] and the related examples discussed afterwards also satisfy its hypotheses .",
    "the conclusion is stronger , since it includes the ideal property for both the crossed product and the fixed point algebra . in particular",
    ", pure infiniteness rules out the phenomenon in example  [ e : twostep ] .",
    "[ p : p1_0126 ] let @xmath0 be an action of a finite group @xmath1 on a c*-algebra  @xmath2 suppose that there is a set @xmath571 of ideals in  @xmath9 each of which is purely infinite and has finite primitive ideal space , with the following property .",
    "for every finite subset @xmath34 and every @xmath35 there is @xmath572 such that @xmath573 for all @xmath39 then @xmath20 and @xmath27 are purely infinite and have the ideal property .",
    "we use the notation @xmath510 from the proof of theorem  [ t - compser-304 ] .",
    "let @xmath306 be the set of all finite subsets of  @xmath574 for @xmath344 set @xmath575 then @xmath576 is finite by corollary  [ c - oldl2_0123 ] .",
    "an argument similar to one used in the proof of theorem  [ t - compser-304 ] shows that @xmath577 is purely infinite , so proposition  4.17 of  @xcite and proposition  [ p - fp303 ] imply that @xmath578 is purely infinite .",

    "<S> in many of our results , additional conditions are necessary on the group , the algebra , or the action . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes the action must be strongly pointwise outer , and in a few results it must have the rokhlin property . when @xmath1 is finite abelian , we prove that crossed products and fixed point algebras by  @xmath1 preserve topological dimension zero with no condition on the action .    </S>",
    "<S> we give an example to show that the ideal property and the projection property do not pass to fixed point algebras ( even when the group is @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the construction also gives an example of a c*-algebra  @xmath7 which does not have the ideal property but such that @xmath8 does have the ideal property ; in fact , @xmath8 has the projection property .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    in this paper , we are interested in permanence properties for crossed products and fixed point algebras by finite groups . for the most part , we consider the following loosely related properties :    * the ideal property . * the projection property . </S>",
    "<S> * topological dimension zero . </S>",
    "<S> * pure infiniteness for nonsimple c*-algebras .    </S>",
    "<S> the ideal property for a c*-algebra  @xmath9 first defined in the introduction of  @xcite , requires that every ideal in  @xmath3 be generated as an ideal by its projections . </S>",
    "<S> the projection property is a strengthening , introduced in definition  1 of  @xcite ; it requires that every ideal in  @xmath3 have an increasing approximate identity consisting of projections . </S>",
    "<S> ( see definition  4.8 of  @xcite for a variation , suitable for use with nonseparable c*-algebras . ) </S>",
    "<S> topological dimension zero , defined in  @xcite ( see definition  [ d - tdzero311 ] below ) , means that the topology of @xmath10 has a base consisting of compact open sets . the main theorem of  @xcite states , in effect , that if @xmath11 is the primitive ideal space of some separable c*-algebra , then @xmath11 is the primitive ideal space of an af  algebra if and only if the topology of @xmath11 has a base consisting of compact open sets . </S>",
    "<S> pure infiniteness for not necessarily simple c*-algebras is as in definition 4.1 of  @xcite . according to corollary  4.3 of  @xcite , if @xmath3 is separable and purely infinite , then the following are equivalent :    * @xmath12 has real rank zero . </S>",

    "<S> * @xmath3 has the ideal property . </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath3 has topological dimension zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the best plausible permanence results are as follows : crossed products by arbitrary discrete groups preserve pure infiniteness , while crossed products by exact actions of discrete groups preserve the other three properties when , except for a finite normal subgroup , the action is strongly pointwise outer </S>",
    "<S> . we do not give theorems in anything like this generality . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it remains unknown whether crossed products by arbitrary actions of finite groups preserve the projection property , the ideal property , or pure infiniteness .    </S>",
    "<S> results on pure infiniteness of crossed products also appear in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they mostly have a somewhat different flavor than the results given here . </S>",
    "<S> most of them assume essential freeness of the action on the equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the c*-algebra  @xmath9 together with some kind of paradoxical decomposition for the action of @xmath1 on  @xmath9 but do not assume that @xmath3 is purely infinite .    </S>",
    "<S> we summarize our results . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec:0019 ] is devoted to rokhlin actions of finite groups on unital c*-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> we show that crossed products and fixed point algebras of such actions preserve pure infiniteness , the class of countable direct limits of finite direct sums of unital kirchberg algebras satisfying the universal coefficient theorem , and the class of wb  algebras .    in section  [ sec:2 - 0303 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we consider strongly pointwise outer actions of finite groups . we show that crossed products by such actions preserve the ideal property and the projection property . </S>",
    "<S> one would hope that no condition on the action would be needed , and that the result would also hold for fixed point algebras . </S>",
    "<S> both together ca nt be true : we exhibit a pointwise outer ( but not strongly pointwise outer ) action of  @xmath13 on a c*-algebra with the projection property such that the fixed point algebra does not even have the ideal property . </S>",
    "<S> a closely related construction gives a c*-algebra  @xmath3 such that @xmath14 has the projection property but @xmath3 does not even have the ideal property , thus giving a negative answer to a question in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : topdimzero ] is devoted to c*-algebras with topological dimension zero . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the crossed product and fixed point algebra of an arbitrary action of a finite abelian group on such a c*-algebra again has topological dimension zero . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the same result for strongly pointwise outer actions of arbitrary finite groups .    in section  [ sec:0123 ] , </S>",
    "<S> we consider purely infinite c*-algebras with finite primitive ideal spaces . we show that crossed products and fixed point algebras of arbitrary actions of finite groups preserve this class . </S>",
    "<S> they also preserve the class of purely infinite c*-algebras with composition series in which all subquotients have finite primitive ideal spaces . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any example of a crossed product of a purely infinite c*-algebra by an action of a finite group which is not purely infinite must be somewhat complicated .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the following conventions and notation throughout this paper . </S>",
    "<S> ideals in c*-algebras are always closed two sided ideals . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is an action of a group  @xmath1 on a c*-algebra  @xmath9 then we denote the fixed point algebra by  @xmath15 we will usually use the same symbol  @xmath16 for the action @xmath17 induced by @xmath16 on an invariant ideal @xmath18 and similarly with invariant subalgebras and subquotients , as well as @xmath19 and similar constructions .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath1 is discrete , the standard unitary in @xmath20 ( or in @xmath21 when @xmath3 is not unital ) corresponding to @xmath22 will be denoted by  @xmath23 we use the same notation for the standard unitaries in reduced crossed products . the standard conditional expectation from @xmath24 to  @xmath3 will usually be denoted by  @xmath25    if @xmath3 is a c*-algebra , then @xmath26 denotes the set of positive elements of  @xmath2    we will make repeated use of the following standard fact .
