    "the differential @xmath3function @xmath14 on the other hand comes out independent of @xmath13 .",
    "this suggests a differential approach for the pair @xmath2 and @xmath15 which makes no reference to the scale @xmath13 at all . that is the present program .",

    "the differential approach parallels completely its discrete brother @xcite .",

    "this interpolation is the motive of the present investigation , in conjunction with the previous construction in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath62-functions from translation invariance have been removed .",
    "the sums of momenta in the kernels are zero through @xmath232 the idea with the parameter @xmath233 is to use part of the exponential large momentum decay of the fluctuation and normal ordering propagators to compensate a possible large momentum growth of the kernels .    in an initial value problem for a scale dependent renormalization group flow with @xmath234bounded initial data this might seem unnecessary .",
    "for instance , a pure @xmath0vertex is given by a constant kernel and is thus @xmath234bounded .",
    "the evolution preserves the @xmath234bound for all _ finite _ scales @xmath13 .",
    "however , we can not expect the solution to be @xmath234bounded _ uniformly _ in @xmath13 .",
    "the limit @xmath235 requires a separate treatment of zero momentum derivatives and taylor remainders of the non - irrelevant kernels .",
    "the price to pay is a growth in momentum space . in the four dimensional case it is polynomial in powers and logarithms of momenta . with an exponential bound we are very far on the safe side .",
    "we prove a large momentum bound for the solution to the renormalization group pde ( [ 5.1 ] ) under the assumption of a large momentum bound on the inhomogeneous side .",
    "the bound uses the @xmath65norm for @xmath67 . although",
    "being rather wasteful , it suffices to prove finiteness of the bilinear renormalization group bracket .",
    "let @xmath97 .",
    "suppose that the function @xmath93 in ( [ 5.1 ] ) has a finite @xmath65norm @xmath236 its solution ( [ 5.3 ] ) then inherits an @xmath65bound .",
    "from @xmath237 it follows that @xmath238 eq .",
    "( [ 8.3 ] ) shows that the irrelevant solution to the renormalization group pde is not only finite but also decreases in the @xmath65-norm .",
    "let @xmath239 . in this case",
    "we assemble @xmath100 using a first order taylor formula .",
    "suppose then that we have @xmath65-bounds on the first derivatives @xmath240 if @xmath100 is marginal , then its first derivatives are irrelevant with scaling dimension minus one .",
    "it follows that @xmath241 therefrom it follows that @xmath242 the result is an @xmath65-bound @xmath243 this estimate is not uniform in @xmath233 .",
    "it works for @xmath233 arbitrary small , but the bound grows with an inverse power of @xmath233 .",
    "the large momentum growth is a consequence of the split in derivatives and taylor remainder .",
    "let @xmath244 .",
    "this case requires a generalization of the bound in the marginal case .",
    "the taylor expansion is pushed to order @xmath245 .",
    "then the derivatives become irrelevant .",
    "we assume @xmath65-estimates on all derivatives @xmath246 of order @xmath247 .",
    "since they are irrelevant with scaling dimension minus one it follows that the corresponding derivatives of @xmath100 obey @xmath248 and are also @xmath65-bounded . from the taylor formula",
    "it then follows that @xmath249 and thus @xmath250 with constants @xmath251 thus we again have an @xmath65-bound on the function @xmath100 .",
    "this completes the large momentum bound on @xmath100 .",
    "exactly the same strategy applies to the derivatives of @xmath100 as well .",
    "the irrelevant derivatives inherit immediately large momentum bounds .",
    "the relevant derivatives require taylor expansions .",
    "we omit to spell out explicitely the necessary bounds on the derivatives of @xmath93 .",
    "the iterative scheme determines order by order @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , and the irrelevant remainders @xmath255 .",
    "it is finite to all orders of perturbation theory because of the following iteration of regularity .",
    "suppose that we have shown the following to all orders @xmath256 : + _ i ) @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 are finite numbers .",
    "ii ) @xmath257 is a smooth function on @xmath258 for all @xmath259 , symmetric in the momenta , and @xmath260-invariant .",
    "iii ) @xmath261 is finite for all @xmath67 , @xmath259 , and @xmath262 . here",
    "@xmath263 is a multi - index which labels momentum derivatives . _",
    "+ then the same statements hold at order @xmath264 . since they are trivially fulfilled to order one they iterate to all orders of perturbation theory .    to prove the iteration of regularity we once more inspect each step of the iterative scheme .",
    "first , the irrelevant remainders @xmath265 are smooth functions on @xmath258 , symmetric under permutations and @xmath260-invariant .",
    "they and all their momentum derivatives satisfy @xmath65-bounds .",
    "they are composed of two contributions .",
    "the first immediately inherits a bound from the induction hypothesis .",
    "the second is a sum of renormalization group brackets of lower orders .",
    "therefore , they consist of multiple convolutions with propagators .",
    "the integrals converge , are smooth functions of the external momenta , and satisfy @xmath65-bounds .",
    "second , we have linear equations for the coefficients @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath202 with finite coefficients . third , the integration of the inhomogeneous renormalization group pdes , yields solutions with the desired properties .",
    "the aim of perturbative renormalization theory is to derive power series expansions for green s functions which are free of divergencies .",
    "the bphz theorem states that this can be accomplished by writing the green s functions in terms of renormalized parameters .",
    "an elegant proof of the bphz theorem was given by callan @xcite",
    ". a polished version of which is due to lesniewski @xcite .",
    "their method is similar to ours in that it is based on renormalization group equations for the renormalized green s functions , the callan - symanzik equations .",
    "the method proposed here is different in that it does _ not _ resort to any kind of graphical analysis , not to analysis of sub - graphs , and not to skeleton expansions .",
    "a new generation of proofs of the bphz theorem was initiated with the work of polchinski @xcite .",
    "his proof has been simplified further by keller , kopper , and salmhofer @xcite .",
    "our method is similar in that it uses an exact renormalization differential equation .",
    "the details are however quite different .",
    "the main difference is that polchinski begins with a cutoff theory .",
    "he then shows how the cutoff can be removed in a way such that the effective interaction remains finite .",
    "our method directly addresses the limit theory without cutoffs , expressed in terms of a renormalization group transformation with cutoffs . roughly speaking , we are here simultaneously changing polchinski s renormalization conditions and integrating an amount of fluctuations . unlike polchinski and followers",
    "we use a renormalization group differential equation with dilatation term .",
    "a way to think of ( [ 1.5 ] ) is as an equation for a renormalization group fixed point of a system which has been enhanced by one degree of freedom , the running coupling .",
    "this fixed point problem can only be formulated with rescaling and with dilatation term .",
    "another renormalization group approach to renormalized perturbation theory comes from gallavotti @xcite and collaborators .",
    "pedagocial accounts of tree expansions can be found in @xcite . there",
    "the result of renormalization is expressed in terms of a renormalized tree expansion .",
    "the program of @xcite with an iterated transformation with fixed @xmath13 is related to the tree expansion .",
    "both are built upon a cumulant expansion for the effective interaction .",
    "the renormalization procedure is however quite different .",
    "like polchinski , gallavotti starts from a cutoff theory .",
    "it is organized in terms of trees , which describe the sub - structure of divergencies in feynman diagrams .",
    "the divergencies are transformed into a flow of the non - irrelevant couplings .",
    "this part is similar to ours .",
    "the basic difference with gallavotti is that we do not organize our expansion in terms of trees .",
    "a hybrid approach between polchinski and gallavotti is due to hurd @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether this constuction of renormalized trajectories extends beyond perturbation theory .",
    "another important question is whether it extends to renormalized trajectories at non - trivial fixed points .",
    "we hope to return with answers to these questions in the future .",
