    "the quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) organic conductors @xmath6 ( where tmtsf is tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene and x represents a monovalent anion , such as @xmath7 , @xmath1 , or @xmath0 ) have very interesting physical properties , including the quantum hall effect and possibly triplet superconductivity @xcite .",
    "these materials consist of parallel conducting chains along the @xmath8 axis , arranged in layers with the interchain spacing @xmath9 along the @xmath10 axis and the interlayer spacing @xmath11 along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the electron - tunneling amplitudes between the tmtsf molecular sites are highly anisotropic in the three directions : @xmath13 k @xcite .",
    "these materials exhibit the angular magnetoresistance oscillations ( amro ) , where resistivity strongly changes as a function of the magnetic - field orientation .",
    "there are three basic types of amro : the lebed magic angles @xcite for the magnetic - field rotation in the @xmath14 plane , the danner - kang - chaikin ( dkc ) oscillations in the @xmath15 plane @xcite , and the third angular effect in the @xmath16 plane @xcite .",
    "the lebed oscillations manifest themselves as sharp peaks in the interlayer conductivity @xmath17 occurring when the magnetic field points from one chain to another along a rational crystallographic direction , as illustrated in fig.[fig : lattice ] . approximating the triclinic crystal lattice of @xmath6 by the orthogonal one ,",
    "the magic lebed angles can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are integer numbers , and @xmath21 is the magnetic field .",
    "experimentally , the lebed effect is the most pronounced for @xmath22 .",
    "lee and naughton @xcite studied amro for generic orientations of @xmath23 , where all three effects coexist .",
    "they found that the lebed oscillations are enhanced when @xmath24 @xcite , and the dkc oscillations still exist in the presence of @xmath25 @xcite .    .",

    "( a ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "( b ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 . ]",
    "although initially the different types of amro were treated as separate phenomena , a unified picture emerged in the recent years due to substantial experimental and theoretical progress .",
    "a three - dimensional visualization of the experimentally measured @xmath31 ( ref .  ) demonstrated that the different types on amro can be viewed as modulations of the basic lebed resonances .",
    "measurements with carefully placed electric contacts @xcite proved that amro exist only in the transverse resistance @xmath32 and not in the longitudinal resistance @xmath33 along the chains .",
    "theory always predicted this difference , but many experiments observed amro in @xmath33 as well because of the mixing between different components of the conductivity tensor .",
    "amro were found not only in the dc conductivity , but also in the ac conductivity at microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "the ac measurements were interpreted in terms of the so - called period orbit resonance ( por ) @xcite , which is a generalization of the cyclotron resonance to more complicated ( e.g. ,  open ) fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "the ac resonances occur at the angles depending on frequency @xmath34 and deviating from eq .",
    "( [ nm ] ) @xcite , so the lebed magic angles are not truly magic @xcite .",
    "this observation eliminates theoretical scenarios proposing a radical change in the ground state of the system depending on the magnetic - field orientation along the magic or non - magic angles .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the absence of any angular effect in nmr @xcite .    given these experimental facts , amro most likely represent some sort of a resonance effect in the dc and ac transport coefficients .",
    "the first theoretical calculation along these lines was done in ref .   using the kubo formula with the electron wave functions for a magnetic field in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "this quantum - mechanical calculation was then generalized to include the @xmath35 component of the magnetic field @xcite and the anion superstructure of @xmath3 @xcite . in another theoretical approach",
    ", the boltzmann kinetic equation was solved for a constant relaxation time @xmath36 by using quasiclassical electron trajectories on the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "this solution can be written in a general form using the so - called shockley tube integral @xcite or the chambers formula @xcite , see also the book @xcite . in the third theoretical approach , the interlayer conductivity was calculated using a perturbation theory in the electron - tunneling amplitude between two layers @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "amro originate from the aharonov - bohm quantum interference in interlayer tunneling in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "all these three seemingly different theoretical approaches produce the same final results and are essentially equivalent .    despite substantial progress in understanding of amro in q1d conductors ,",
    "some experimental results remain unexplained .",
    "one open problem is the angular oscillations of the nernst effect @xcite .",
    "another unresolved problem is the angular minimum and saturation of the interlayer resistivity @xmath32 observed for a magnetic field in the @xmath10 direction @xcite .",
    "although the manifestations of amro are qualitatively similar in all members of the @xmath6 family , direct comparison of the measurements in @xmath37 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 shows substantial differences @xcite .    for a magnetic - field rotation in the @xmath14 plane with @xmath38 , only three strong lebed peaks in @xmath17 with @xmath39",
    "are observed in @xmath37 @xcite . when special care is taken to ensure that @xmath38 , the very weak peaks with @xmath40 in @xmath37 disappear completely @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath2 , strong lebed oscillations are observed up to @xmath41 @xcite . in @xmath3 , the lebed oscillations are much weaker in amplitude than in @xmath37 and @xmath2 @xcite , but many lebed resonance can be detected after differentiation of the data with respect to the angle of rotation @xcite .",
    "the strength of the dkc oscillations is also very different in these materials .",
    "the dkc oscillations are quite strong in @xmath3 , where they were originally discovered @xcite . in @xmath37 , ref",
    ".   found very weak dkc oscillations , but ref .   found them to be substantial",
    "however , in @xmath2 , the dkc oscillations are extremely weak and almost invisible @xcite .",
    "this dramatic difference in manifestations of amro in the three materials requires a theoretical explanation .",
    "when a magnetic field is rotated in the @xmath14 plane at @xmath38 , the theoretical calculations cited above show that the lebed peaks in @xmath17 can exist only for those magic angles @xmath42 where the interchain tunneling amplitudes in the directions @xmath43 are present @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the interplane tunneling amplitudes in @xmath37 exist between the nearest and next - nearest chains in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "this would explain why only the lebed resonance with @xmath39 are observed in @xmath37 . however , many magic angles with big numbers @xmath19 are observed in @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is hard to imagine that direct electron overlap exists between the chains separated by 11 interchain distances .    one way to resolve this problem",
    "is to take into account the nonlinear electron dispersion along the chains .",
    "( all theoretical papers cited above make a linearized approximation for the electron dispersion along the chains . ) the first attempt in this direction was made in ref .  , and a more systematic study was presented in refs .   and .",
    "the nonlinearity can indeed generate an effect similar , albeit not completely equivalent , to the presence of many interchain tunneling amplitudes . however , the nonlinearity alone is not sufficient to explain the differences in amro between the three compounds .",
    "another problem is the absence of the dkc oscillations in @xmath2 .",
    "one might think that quantum coherence is too low in this material , but the existence of 21 lebed oscillations clearly refutes this idea @xcite .",
    "we see that a detailed theoretical understanding of amro in the @xmath6 materials is challenging and requires additional ideas .",
    "we believe that the key to understanding the differences in amro is the presence of anion ordering in @xmath3 and @xmath2 and its absence in @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath7 is an octagonal centrosymmetric anion , which does not experience any orientational ordering at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are tetragonal anions without inversion symmetry . because their crystal sites have inversion symmetry , these anions have two different orientations of the same energy . at low temperatures ,",
    "the anions experience orientational ordering and produce crystal superstructures @xcite with the wave vectors @xmath46 in @xmath3 ( under ambient pressure ) and @xmath47 in @xmath2 ( under pressure greater than about 10 kbar ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "formation of a crystal superstructure affects electron spectrum by folding the brillouin zone . in this paper",
    ", we show that reconstruction of the electron dispersion caused by the anion ordering generates effective tunneling amplitudes between many distant chains .",
    "this effect explains why many lebed angles are observed in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but not in @xmath37 .",
    "it also explains why the magic angles [ eq .",
    "( [ nm ] ) ] are observed only for odd @xmath19 in @xmath2 ( ref .  ) and only for even @xmath19 in @xmath3 ( refs .   and ) at @xmath22 .",
    "we also explain the differences in the dkc oscillations within the same framework .",
    "in contrast to the previous theories of amro for the anion superstructure of @xmath3 @xcite , we take into account the direct effect of anion ordering on the interlayer tunneling amplitude , which is especially important for @xmath2 . in this way",
    ", we can capture the characteristic features of amro in the three compounds without invoking the nonlinearity of the longitudinal electron dispersion @xcite .    in the second part of the paper ( sec .",
    "[ sec : interband ] ) , we study the effect of a strong magnetic field parallel to the layers . we show that , when @xmath48 is strong enough and exceeds a certain threshold related to the anion gap @xmath49 , the interlayer tunneling between different branches of the folded electron dispersion becomes possible , and @xmath17 should increases sharply .",
    "experimental observation of this effect would allow direct measurement of @xmath49 .",
    "this effect can be also applied to study the interband tunneling in @xmath4-@xmath5 .",
    "a theory of this effect can not be formulated within the framework of quasiclassical orbits on a warped fermi surface .",
    "we calculate an interlayer conductivity in the presence of anion ordering using the quantum limit , where the electron wave functions are confined to the layers due to a strong parallel magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the general form of the electron dispersion in a q1d metal is @xmath50 where the energy @xmath51 is measured from the fermi energy , and @xmath52 is the electron wave vector . here",
    "we linearize the dispersion along the chains with the fermi velocity @xmath53 near the fermi wave vectors @xmath54 .",
    "there are two sheets of the open fermi surface , but we present calculations only for the sheet with @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 , we can expand the transverse dispersion @xmath57 to the lowest order in the interlayer tunneling amplitude @xmath58 , @xmath59 for a simple model with electron tunneling between the nearest chains in the absence of a superstructure , eq .",
