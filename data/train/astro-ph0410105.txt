    "five classical novae have been observed with xmm - newton between two and four years after the outburst .",
    "two of them are bright x - ray sources , with their x - ray emission spanning the whole energy range of the epic cameras , 0.2 - 8 kev . in both cases",
    ", the spectrum indicates that the main origin of the x - rays is not photospheric , and that hydrogen burning has ceased on the white dwarf envelope , thus indicating turn - off times shorter than @xmath0 years .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of nova sgr 1998 ( v4633 sgr ) is dominated by thermal plasma emission , which can be due to the shock - heated expanding shell , or to the reestablishment of accretion in the cataclysmic variable .",
    "the best - fit model is a three - temperature thermal plasma , with temperatures between 0.1 kev and 40 kev .",
    "thermal plasma models with different compositions ( solar , and several co and one enhanced from realistic nova models ) have been tried , and the best - fit is obtained either with a co enhanced model , or with the solar abundances .",
    "the first case would correspond to emission from the expanding nova shell .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of the thermal plasma component is indeed compatible with the x - ray emission from other observed nova shells , as well as the electronic densities derived from the emission measure .",
    "the possibility of accretion being reestablished , which would be simulated by the solar thermal plasma model , can not be ruled out . in this case , the luminosity of the plasma would be compatible with accretion in a intermediate polar cataclysmic variable",
    ". optical observations of v4366 sgr also support the magnetic character of this nova , indicating that it is a nearly synchronous system @xcite .",
    "xmm - newton observations of nova oph 1998 ( v2487 oph ) surprised us showing that accretion had been reestablished on the cataclysmic variable less than 1000 days after outburst @xcite . the spectrum in this case",
    "is also dominated by thermal plasma emission , but an additional excess around 6.4 kev indicates the presence of iron k@xmath1 fluorescent lines .",
    "fluorescent lines arise from reflection of hard x - rays on a cold plasma , thus implying the reestablishment of accretion by the time of observations .",
    "the spectrum shows also a soft component associated to a fraction of the white dwarf surface heated by hard x - rays from the accretion shock region , which is another common feature in accreting cataclysmic variables , specially on magnetic systems .",
    "the high temperature and large luminosity of the thermal plasma emission also indicate that v2487 oph probably occurred on a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "v2487 oph is twice exceptional , since the cataclysmic variable hosting the nova was also detected eight years before the outburst during the rosat all sky survey .",
    "this detection makes v2487 oph the first classical nova detected in x - rays before and after the outburst , and supports the cataclysmic variable scenario for classical novae ."
