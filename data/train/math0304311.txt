    "if it can be distinguished , can the parameter @xmath12 be recovered , again only from @xmath11 ?",
    "harris and keane proved the following :    there exist a sequence of functions @xmath13 , not depending on @xmath4 , so that @xmath14 almost surely .    in fact , the model in @xcite is more general , allowing the walk to be any null - recurrent markov chain .",
    "let @xmath15 be the distribution of @xmath11 on @xmath16 .",
    "recall that two borel measures are _ mutually singular _ if there is a borel set which is null for one measure such that its complement is null for the other measure ; in this case the measures are distinguished by almost any observation .",
    "whether or not @xmath15 and @xmath17 are mutually singular depends on the graph , and as was shown in @xcite , sometimes on the bias @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite provides a partial criterion for determining singularity based on the graph , while the full story  in particular the role of @xmath12 for certain graphs  is completed in @xcite .    in this paper , this model is generalized in a different direction .",

    "now allow a random walker to move on @xmath3 , and suppose that on her @xmath19th move she is at position @xmath20 and she tosses a coin with bias @xmath21 , generating the random variable @xmath22 .",
    "again , the path of the walker , @xmath23 is not observed , and the output is only the outcomes of the coin tosses , that is , @xmath24 .",
    "the main result of this paper says that the biases @xmath25 can be recovered , up to a shift and reflection of @xmath3 , in the case when the number of vertices with @xmath26 is finite :    [ thm : coins ] suppose that attached to each site @xmath0 is a coin with bias @xmath1 , and only finitely many of these coins have non - zero bias .",
    "allow a simple random walker to generate observations by tossing , at each move , the coin attached to its current position .",
    "then it is possible to determine the biases @xmath2 , up to a shift and reflection of @xmath3 , _ using only a single observation of the infinite sequence of these coin tosses and no information about the path of the random walker_.        another related model was introduced by benjamini and kesten @xcite ( and independently , by den hollander and keane ) . instead of attaching a coin with bias @xmath27 to each @xmath28 , a fixed _ color _ is assigned to each vertex .",
    "the random walker reports only the sequence of colors visited , while just as in our generalization of the harris - keane model , the path itself is hidden .",
