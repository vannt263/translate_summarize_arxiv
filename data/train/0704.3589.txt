    "my analysis compares six published mass loss laws with the results of bowen s 1995 model grid .",
    "reimers original formula ( 1975 ) , was a fit of mass loss rate vs. @xmath8 using an assortment of stars for which mass loss measurements were available in 1975 ; the same collection of observations could have equally well been fitted as functions of @xmath9 or other combinations of parameters ( goldberg 1979 ) .",
    "vassiliadis and wood ( 1993 = vw ) fitted mass loss rates vs. period for pulsating agb stars , mostly miras .",
    "van loon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used data for supergiants .",
    "wachter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) based theirs on models for carbon stars .",
    "schrder and cuntz ( 2005 ) proposed a correction to the reimers formula based on some theoretical arguments .",
    "blcker ( 1995 ) proposed a modification to the reimers formula based on fitting models from bowen ( 1988 ) .",
    "finally , the bowen and willson ( bw ) prescription is based on a 1995 grid of models that incorporated some essential features not found in any of the others , or bowen ( 1988 ) : models followed the evolutionary tracks of individual stars , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mixing length parameter , and the driving amplitude of the `` piston '' boundary was regulated so that the peak power scales with stellar luminosity .",
    "mass loss rates are sensitive to stellar parameters @xmath0 , @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 . to compare them",
    ", we use the definition of effective temperature , @xmath16 ; a period - mass - radius relation @xmath17 ; and an evolutionary track @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to write all seven formulae as @xmath19 along a common set of evolutionary tracks .",
    "for each mass , @xmath20 defines the deathline luminosity @xmath21 ; this yields critical mass loss rate @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "four of the relations ( reimers , sc , vw , and bw ) have ( @xmath24 ) and ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the van loon et al .",
    "relation would be close to an extension of this death zone to higher masses , but its slope is too shallow to match the lower mass stars .",
    "wachter et al.s carbon star mass loss rates have a relatively shallow slope and lower @xmath21 , as does blcker s .",
    "figure 1 shows mass loss rates for reimers , vw , and bw formulae , and the deathline for each case .",
    "it is clear that these two purely observational and quite independent empirical formulae agree substantially on the luminosity where the mass loss becomes important , although their @xmath26 are quite different .",
    "i conclude that we know the deathline quite well , at least for stars between 1 and 2 solar masses .",
    "the deathline satisfies @xmath27 and the death zone extends @xmath28 in mass loss rate above and below the deathline ; the death zone s extent in @xmath29 , and thus in time , is quite different for reimers ; formula compared with vw and bw .",
    "most tests of mass loss formulae have checked only whether they give the right order of magnitude of mass loss at the right range of stellar parameters .",
    "however , two other tests are potentially much more constraining and informative : do they give the right @xmath30 and the right @xmath31 ?",
    "it is in these slopes that the various relations differ most . for shallow slopes , such as the reimers , wachter et al . , and van loon et al .",
    "examples , the mass loss occurs gradually as a star evolves up the agb , so that by the time it reaches @xmath21 it has already lost a significant fraction of its original mass . in constrast ,",
    "the vw and bw formulae dictate that the mass is lost mostly near @xmath21 .",
    "slopes @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath31 in the vicinity of @xmath21 for m = 1 and 2 are given for these seven formulae in table 1 , using on the iben ( 1984 ) evolutionary tracks @xmath33 and ostlie and cox ( 1986 ) @xmath34 .",
    ".slopes from seven mass loss formulae : reimers ( 1975 ) , vassiliadis and wood ( 1993 ) , blcker ( 1995 ) , wachter et al ( 2002 ) , schrder and cuntz ( 2005 ) , van loon et al ( 2005 ) , and bowen and willson ( see willson 2000 , 2006 ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the slopes may be compared directly with observational constraints .",
    "the slope @xmath32 determines the amplitude of variation of the mass loss rate when the luminosity and/or radius of a star is varying , for example over a shell flash cycle .",
    "for the shell flash variation we could , in principle , use @xmath35 and @xmath36 from evolutionary models , but these show that a very good approximation is obtained by using just @xmath35 and assuming the shell flash variation stays on the same evolutionary track .",
    "so @xmath37 ; for a shell flash cycle @xmath38 .",
    "observations ( e.g. olofsson et al 1990 ; schier , lindqvist , and olofsson 2005 ; decin et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest that the variation is at least 1 or 2 dex , a result consistent only with the vw observational result and the bw models of the seven formulae tested .",
    "there are significant secular and quasi - periodic variations in @xmath13 for about 10 % of all miras ( templeton et al 2005 ) , an opportunity for further testing of the luminosity ( or @xmath12 or @xmath14 ) dependence .",
    "the slope @xmath39 is harder to derive from observations , as it requires either that we know @xmath15 for individual stars with measured @xmath40 or that we are able to fit a trend .",
    "the scatter of observations around the vw fit , about @xmath41 1dex , is an indication that @xmath32 is large ; if the range of masses included at a given @xmath13 is taken from evolutionary tracks crossing the mira period - luminosity relation ( vw figure 20 ) , then the scatter in mass loss rate around the vw fit suggests @xmath42 ; however , both the numerator and the denominator are sensitive to observational error .",
    "an observational quantity related to @xmath39 is the duration of the mass loss phase .",
    "this may be defined as the time it takes the mass loss rate to increase by 2 dex near @xmath21 , and we have used @xmath43 1 dex for the death zone . for use with observational data , where @xmath15 and hence @xmath21 are not well known , the duration from @xmath44 - 7 to -5 will work equally well and give nearly the same answer .",
    "when there is substantial positive feedback between mass loss and mass loss rates , this shortens the duration of the mass loss phase substantially : for example , for the bw prescription with @xmath45 artificially set to zero we get a duration ( from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ) of @xmath48 years while for the full bw prescription this is @xmath49 years .",
    "observations - for example , the width of the mira @xmath50 relationship - suggest that the actual duration is no more than 200,000 years .    ultimately , the strongest test of mass loss relations near @xmath51 will be comparing the observed distribution of stars , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 with those obtained from evolution models using a well - chosen mass loss formula .",
    "it is very difficult , perhaps impossible , to derive a mass loss prescription for use in stellar evolution directly from a set of mass loss observations , for the simple reason that measurable rates occur only for a narrow range of stellar parameters .",
    "observational fits of agb stars agree what those stellar parameters are , giving consistent deathtlines @xmath55 . to determine the dependence of the mass loss rates on stellar parameters for a given star",
    "as it evolves , we need to use models and indirect observational constraints .",
    "thus we can constrain @xmath56 at a given @xmath0 using the amplitude of variation of the mass loss rate for a given @xmath57 or @xmath58 , particularly near the deathline defined by @xmath59 .",
    "we can also constrain @xmath39 , for a given @xmath4 , by the duration of the mass loss phase , or the width of the death zone . for currently available data , and using a standard set of evolutionary tracks , @xmath60 ; @xmath61 is probably also greater than 10 and may be as large as 20 .    for such large values of the exponents ,",
    "their precise values only modify the shape of the corner in @xmath62 vs. @xmath29 ; the general pattern is the same .",
    "the mass remains essentially constant until the star reaches the deathzone , and then the envelope is removed in a short time . for population studies ,",
    "all we really need to know is the deathline ; a very good approximation for all mass loss formulae fitting the deduced sensitivity to @xmath0 and @xmath15 is that they evolve at constant mass to @xmath21 and then their envelope disappears .",
    "the details of the mass loss formulae will still matter to those who wish to model the post - agb phases or match the structure of the outflow as modulated by changes in @xmath0 and @xmath15 in the final stages , but for overall evolution of populations all that is needed is @xmath63 , and this we know quite well , at least for @xmath15 @xmath64 1 to 2 @xmath65 and @xmath3 @xmath64 solar .",
