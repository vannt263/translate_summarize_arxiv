    "the solar tachocline plays a fundamental role in governing the dynamics and evolution of the sun s interior magnetic fields , manifestations of which are observed at the solar surface .",
    "the tachocline is a very thin ( @xmath0 ) transition layer at the base of the convection zone through which the solar differential rotation changes from latitudinal in the convection zone to a uniform core rotation .",
    "this layer contains strong radial and weak latitudinal differential rotation .    due to existence of both radial and latitudinal shear in the tachocline ,",
    "the study of its dynamics and physics is complex .",
    "analysis of tachocline hydro- and magnetohydrodynamics have proceeded in two different ways : the first way treats the thin tachocline explicitly as a full three dimensional multilayered spherical system ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the other way is to treat the tachocline as a one - layer system .",
    "the multilayer system has been used to study the dynamics of both shears , radial and latitudinal , while the one - layer system has been applied to examine the dynamics and stability of only the latitudinal shear . over the past decade , various models have been built for global hd / mhd of the tachocline latitudinal shear  2d , quasi-3d shallow - water systems and 3d thin - shell primitive equation systems , under both the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations .",
    "the linear and nonlinear calculations of hd / mhd instability of tachocline latitudinal shear have been performed in great detail for a 2d ( latitude - longitude ) system .",
    "these studies led to the following major outcomes : ( i ) solar tachocline latitudinal shear is hydrodynamically stable in pure 2d systems @xcite ; ( ii ) mhd shear instability with longitudinal wavenumber @xmath1 to 7 sets in and persists in the solar tachocline in the presence of a wide range of toroidal field profiles ( from broad to narrow bands ) , amplitudes and latitude - locations @xcite ; ( iii ) axisymmetric hd / mhd instability does not , or more precisely , can not exist in 2d ; ( iv ) as consequences of the nonlinear evolution of this instability , broad toroidal fields open up into `` clam - shell '' patterns @xcite , whereas narrow bands tip @xcite .",
    "we now know that the 2d results are robust .",
    "all of them obtained from linear analysis have been found to appear in more complex quasi-3d ` shallow - water ' systems @xcite , in which the third dimension is generally included in a restricted way , namely the upper boundary of the shallow fluid - shell is allowed to vary with latitude , longitude and time so that the radial motions can occur .",
    "intuitively it is expected that the inclusion of the third dimension would produce some other unstable modes that are purely characteristic of 3d because , in addition to the kinetic and magnetic energy reservoirs due to the presence of differential rotation and magnetic field , 3d systems allow energy extraction from the potential energy reservoir , particularly when the effective gravity ( @xmath2 ) of the system is low .",
    "@xmath2 is a measure of the subadiabatic stratification of the fluid layer ; low @xmath2 can allow more deformation of the fluid - layer s top surface . in linear studies , it was indeed found that a hydrodynamically stable 2d tachocline can be unstable to quasi-3d perturbations , due to the presence of this additional energy source in a shallow - water model @xcite .",
    "many idealized shallow - water models have been built over the past century , since the first , single - layer model by hough ( 1898 ) . for studying the mid - latitude oceanic tides and atmospheric zonal flows and meridional circulation ,",
    "multi - layer shallow - water models are used @xcite .",
    "shallow water models are also being used for operational forecasts of el nino and la nina @xcite .",
    "shallow water theory was applied to the global solar tachocline by gilman ( 2000 ) , who first formulated an mhd analog of a shallow - water system . since then , all global studies of hd / mhd shallow - water instabilities in the solar tachocline have been performed in the linear regime . nonetheless , even within the scope of a linear model , the upward",
    "bulging of a magnetized shallow fluid layer created at certain longitudes , by growing modes with low - longitudinal wavenumbers , can provide a plausible explanation of the sun s `` active longitudes '' ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this linear model was able to simulate active longitudes up to 15 carrington rotations , after which nonlinear interactions among the unstable modes start playing important roles . in order to be able to simulate active longitudes for one full solar cycle and several solar cycles , it is necessary to study the the nonlinear evolution of the aforementioned instability in the tachocline fluid layer .    over the past decade ,",
    "several 3d thin - shell and full 3d hd and mhd models for linear analysis of tachocline shear instabilities have been built @xcite .",
    "however , unlike many studies of nonlinear evolution of shallow - water instabilities in the oceanic and atmospheric context ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , there exist only a few studies of the nonlinear evolution of 3d mhd instabilities in the solar context , using 3d thin - shell models @xcite .",
    "although in a shallow - water model the radial dimension of the fluid layer is included in a simplified way by allowing the layer s thickness to vary with latitude , longitude and time , it is not as restricted compared to a full 3d mhd system as it might appear . @xcite",
    "have shown that an mhd shallow - water approach is a first - order approximation of a full mhd equilibrium in which the magnetic curvature stress is balanced by a latitudinal pressure gradient for a strongly subadiabatic stratification and by modification in the shear flow for a weakly subadiabatic stratification .",
    "the height deformation of the top surface layer in the shallow - water approach corresponds to the deformation of the surfaces of constant entropy required for latitudinal force balance in the full mhd approach . thus using a shallow water system for the sun , specifically for the solar tachocline",
    ", can help reduce the complexity of a full 3d mhd system without much affecting the basic physics behind the global dynamics of the fluid layer .    putting aside the added complexity due to the presence of magnetic fields , we first focus on the nonlinear evolution of shear instability in an unmagnetized solar tachocline and find out how the tachocline latitudinal differential rotation profile can evolve with time and get modified due to the influence of this instability . in pure 2d calculations ,",
    "the jets were seen to form around the locations of the singular points arising from the coincidence between the doppler - shifted phase - speed of the unstable modes and the shear - speed of the system , or the alfvenic singular points in the case of magnetized tachocline @xcite . along with the exploration of jet - formation on unperturbed differential rotation profiles due to the nonlinear evolution of hydrodynamic shear instability ,",
    "another major aim of this paper is to study the nonlinear evolution of the bulging and depression of the fluid layer in conjunction with the shear flow pattern , or in other words , the exchanges between the kinetic and potential energies of the system .",
    "we will present the mathematical formulation including equations and solution techniques in  2 and in the appendix , and the implementation of spectral viscosity in  3 . in the description of results in",
    " 4 we will present in the first subsection how the energy spectrum develops , i.e. how the total energy gets distributed in different longitudinal wavenumbers and how they evolve with time .",
    "the subsequent subsections of  4 will focus on the evolution of the sun s longitude - averaged differential rotation and the height profile , the energy exchanges between kinetic and potential energy reservoirs , and the evolution of flow and deformation of the fluid layer on the latitude - longitude surface .",
    "we will summarize our findings in  5 .",
    "hydrodynamic shallow - water equations were built for studying global atmospheric and oceanic dynamics ; they exist in the literature in various forms , for example see @xcite . following that , @xcite described the hydrodynamic shallow - water equations , along with the usual assumptions and approximations in their  2.1 and  2.2 and solved them in the linear regime .",
    "briefly , in a shallow water model the velocity ( @xmath3 ) of the fluid can be defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the horizontal velocity components in longitude ( @xmath7 ) and latitude ( @xmath8 ) respectively , and @xmath9 is the radial velocity . in the shallow water approximation , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are independent of depth , and",
    "@xmath9 is a linear function of depth . for a shallow fluid layer with a rigid bottom and a deformable top",
    ", the maximum vertical velocity will be at the top .    due to the thinness of the tachocline compared to the solar radius",
    ", the divergence of radius and the density variation within the shallow fluid layer are ignored in the momentum and mass - continuity equations .",
    "all time scales of the system are considered much longer than the acoustic time scale . with these assumptions ,",
    "the hydrodynamic shallow water equations for a single - layer tachocline can be derived from the mass continuity and momentum equations ( see @xcite for detailed derivation ) . in order to study the nonlinear evolution of the hydrodynamic shallow - water instability in the solar tachocline ,",
    "we start from the equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 8) of @xcite and rewrite the nonlinear dimensional hydrodynamic shallow - water equations in the rotating frame as ,    @xmath10 - { 1 \\over r_0 \\cos\\phi } { \\partial \\over \\partial\\lambda}\\left ( { u^2 + v^2 \\over 2}\\right ) -{gh",

    "we make equations ( 1 - 3 ) dimensionless by choosing the radius of the shell ( @xmath14 ) as the length - scale and the inverse of the core rotation rate ( @xmath15 ) as the time - scale of the system ; thus the thickness of the fluid layer representing either the radiative or the overshoot part of the solar tachocline should be between 0.01 and 0.05 dimensionless units , and one year time will correspond to about 100 dimensionless units .",
    "the nondimensional equations are    @xmath16 - { 1 \\over \\cos\\phi } { \\partial \\over \\partial\\lambda}\\left ( { u^2 + v^2 \\over 2}\\right ) -g { 1 \\over \\cos\\phi } { \\partial h \\over \\partial\\lambda } + 2 \\omega_c v \\sin\\phi , \\quad\\eqno(4)\\ ] ]    @xmath17 - { \\partial \\over \\partial\\phi}\\left ( { u^2 + v^2 \\over 2}\\right ) -g { \\partial h \\over \\partial\\phi } - 2 \\omega_c u \\sin\\phi , \\quad\\eqno(5)\\ ] ]    @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is the effective gravity . with typical values @xmath20 , the pressure scale height ,",
    "the value of @xmath2 is high ( @xmath21 ) in the radiative tachocline and low ( @xmath22 ) in the overshoot part of the tachocline .    due to the pole problem",
    ", it is difficult to solve the advective form of shallow - water equations in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "it is a fundamental problem for solving numerically the partial differential equations on the sphere , particularly using finite difference methods ",
    "certain terms are likely to be unbounded in the neighborhood of the poles .",
    "spectral methods are popular for their high accuracy and their ability to avoid the pole problem .",
    "there exists a vast literature on how to avoid the pole problem .",
    "we follow here a technique proposed by @xcite and so we define the vorticity ( @xmath23 ) and divergence ( @xmath24 ) as @xmath25 ,   \\quad\\eqno(7a)\\ ] ] @xmath26 ,   \\quad\\eqno(7b)\\ ] ] and rewrite the equations ( 4 - 6 ) as follows : @xmath27 , \\quad\\eqno(8)\\ ] ] @xmath28 , \\quad\\eqno(9)\\ ] ] @xmath29 where,@xmath30 is the coriolis parameter .",
    "we apply the spectral transform method @xcite to solve the equations ( 8 - 10 ) , by expanding the vector field ( i.e. the flow ) and the scalar field ( height ) respectively in terms of vector and scalar harmonics .",
    "thus the pole problem can be handled efficiently without raising the order of the equations .",
    "the appendix describes in detail the technique used to solve the equations ( 8 - 10 ) .",
    "we express the solar tachocline latitudinal differential rotation in angular measure , @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 . from the knowledge of helioseismic observations",
    "the mathematical form of @xmath31 has been adopted as @xmath33 in which @xmath34 represents the solid rotation of the core , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are numerical coefficients .",
    "@xmath38 represents solar latitudinal differential rotation near the surface , whereas in the radiative part of the tachocline , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "detailed parameter surveys in the linear regime @xcite have revealed that @xmath31 becomes unstable to perturbations with longitudinal wavenumbers @xmath1 and @xmath40 for a wide range of @xmath36 and @xmath37 values . in order to focus our study on how this instability evolves in the cases of high and low effective gravity ( @xmath2 )",
    ", we pick an @xmath31 with @xmath41 , @xmath37=0.09 and @xmath42 so that the pole - to - equator differential rotation is 24% .",
    "linear studies indicate that this differential rotation is hydrodynamically unstable for a wide range of @xmath2",
    ". therefore we can demonstrate the features of the time - evolution of this differential rotation for both high @xmath2 and low @xmath2 cases , in particular @xmath43 and 0.5 @xcite which are , respectively , characteristic of radiative and overshoot tachoclines .",
    "we also study a few other cases with 30% and 15% pole - to - equator differential rotation . in all cases",
    "we start with an initial reference state profile that is a combination of unperturbed profile and a perturbation with low longitudinal wavenumbers ( mostly @xmath1 mode ) , with a specified amplitude with respect to the unperturbed differential rotation .    in all simulations",
    "we start from known solutions to the linearized instability equations , rather than from perturbations of arbitrary form , which has the effect of initially filtering gravity waves out of the calculations . but",
    "once nonlinearities become important , gravity wave modes can and frequently are excited and subsequently participate in the overall dynamics .",
    "spectral methods , despite their accuracy and absence of pole problems , are prone to generating spurious oscillations in physical space and hence a reduction in global accuracy . in the case of nonlinear evolution equations in an idealized , inviscid model like the one we are presently dealing with , spectral methods generate energy cascade from lower to higher wave number modes , which often creates a spectrum with an erroneously high amplitude tail at high longitudinal wavenumbers  the so - called spectral blocking problem , which could eventually lead to a poor energy - conservation during the nonlinear evolution of the system .",
    "the traditional approach is to use an artificial horizontal diffusion to deal with these difficulties of spectral methods .",
    "we apply the spectral viscosity ( sv ) , as prescribed by @xcite , which is a spherical spectral viscosity operator , able to conserve invariants of the system at no additional computing cost and to retain the high wave number information in the system .",
    "the dynamical variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are filtered at each time step using the formula @xmath50 in which @xmath51 with @xmath52 satisfying the following two conditions : @xmath53 @xmath54 } , \\,\\,\\ ,                 { \\rm for } \\,\\ ,",

    "the @xmath57 and @xmath58 have been taken to be @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the pattern of @xmath61 as function of @xmath62 is shown in figure 1 .    in a viscous model for the astrophysical fluid simulations ,",
    "the use of artificial horizontal diffusion will not be needed , as it would always include the physical diffusion ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison between an inviscid model with artificial diffusion and a viscous model without artificial diffusion can be done by using the similar amount of artificial and physical diffusion in respective models . in order to derive an equivalent physical diffusion from the artificial diffusion used in an inviscid model",
    ", a plausible experiment can be set up as follows . by switching off all energy sources , such as kinetic energy from shear flow and the potential energy from effective gravity",
    ", just the time - rate of the spread of a 2d gaussian function in latitude - longitude direction can be studied in the presence of an artificial diffusion .",
    "the horizontal diffusion , estimated from the rate of spread of 2d gaussian function , can be used as the amount of physical diffusion in a viscous model without any artificial diffusion .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of a shallow - water instability , specifically the spectral blocking issue and the quality of energy conservation from such a viscous model can be compared with that from an inviscid model with artificial diffusion .",
    "a forthcoming paper will address this comparison quantitatively .",
    "however , one of the limitations of a single - layer shallow - water model , in both viscous and inviscid cases , is that the horizontal velocities are independent of depth  only the vertical velocity varies with depth .",
    "thus there are no viscous terms that involve radial second derivatives of horizontal velocities in the horizontal components of the momentum equations . in reality ,",
    "a full 3d tachocline model will be a viscous model .",
    "so a multilayer shallow - water model will be needed to connect the layers through some diffusion in the radial direction , as has been done in the case of a full 3d , multilayer tachocline model by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the effect of radial diffusion can be explored by using a newton s cooling type formalism in which the radial diffusion terms can be converted into drag terms ( for example , see @xcite ) . in future ,",
    "development of such a model will also help investigate the effect of forcing the differential rotation at the top of the layer .      in order to increase the efficiency of the numerical code",
    ", we use an adjustable time step which can be changed ( up or down ) during the the simulation .",
    "if the time step , @xmath63 , is taken large , it may result in poor energy conservation , whereas if it is taken small , it will lead to longer runs that will take many steps and more time to compute .",
    "in the course of a computation , if the system is going through an interval near the peak of its potential or kinetic energy , then a somewhat lower time step will ensure better accuracy . at other times of the evolution ,",
    "a larger time step can be taken , because that will speed up the computation .",
    "therefore we have implemented a variable time step that is adjustable at each iteration .",
    "the scheme for adjusting time step is described below .",
    "we define @xmath57 as the fractional update of a variable the ratio of the magnitude of the update of that variable and the magnitude of the variable at that time step . when evaluating @xmath57 we exclude those variables whose absolute magnitude is less than @xmath64 , because the effect of those variables on the physical dynamics at that point in time is very small compared to the normalized variables .",
    "then we evaluate the maximum value of @xmath57 over all the updates at that time step .",
    "if the maximum in @xmath57 turns out to be less than @xmath65 then we scale up the next time step by a factor of @xmath66 of current time step . on the other hand ,",
    "if the maximum in @xmath57 is greater than @xmath65 then we scale down the time step by @xmath67 and reevaluate the evolution of the variables at that time step . in this way we limit the amount of maximum update of a variable , and hence the drastic change in the system at a given time step , to achieve good energy conservation over long periods of time .",
    "values of scale - down and scale - up in the time - step are chosen to be 20% and 2% respectively .",
    "these are somwhat arbitrary , but we have found for our present calculations the amount of scale - down in the time - step needs to be larger than that of scale - up .",
    "this is because accuracy in the conservation of the energy deteriorates when the system is evolving rapidly .",
    "in order to present results and physical interpretations in a well - organized fashion , we divide this section into four subsections , which will successively present the convergence test related to the selection of longitudinal wavenumbers , a test for total energy conservation and exchanges among different energy reservoirs , nonlinear evolution of longitude - averaged flow and height profiles , and nonlinear evolution of flow accompanied by deformations of the fluid shell in latitude and longitude .      for the technique described in detail in the appendix ,",
    "the computation speed largely depends on the number of @xmath62 s and @xmath68 s we select in the basis functions .",
    "the total energy is defined in this system as @xmath69 , \\quad\\eqno(12)\\ ] ] in which @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath13 represent longitudinal velocity , latitudinal velocity and height deformation .",
    "since the modes with longitudinal wavenumbers @xmath1 and 2 are the only modes that are linearly unstable in the solar tachocline , we construct our initial configuration of the flow and height - deformation by using the modes with @xmath68 equal to @xmath70 at the most .",
    "we calculate the energy distribution at each longitudinal wavenumber @xmath68 , using the expression ( 12 ) , for two @xmath2 values , namely @xmath43 and @xmath71 , and plot them in figures 2(a ) and ( b ) as functions of @xmath68 . in both cases",
    "we have taken a pole - to - equator differential rotation amplitude of 24% with @xmath41 , @xmath72 in the expression ( 13 ) .",
    "the total energy of the system for different wavenumbers @xmath1 through 10 , plotted at the time @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( respectively by black , red and blue diamonds ) show that the energy contribution falls off rapidly with @xmath68 . at @xmath73 the total energy of the system",
    "is contained in @xmath76 and @xmath1 , because that is how we constructed the reference state . which suggests that @xmath68 may be truncated at @xmath77 or @xmath78 with very little loss of accuracy",
    "; this speeds up our computation enormously .",
    "because the fluid - shell system with latitudinal differential rotation has its own inherent instability for low - order longitudinal wavenumber modes , in the course of the nonlinear evolution of such a system its unstable modes grow by taking energy from the unperturbed system and thus modifying the system . at a certain point",
    "the reference - state system gets modified to the extent that it takes back energy from the perturbations .",
    "the cascading of energy to higher longitudinal modes is not significant in this system for @xmath68 below 6 or 7 ; instead a stable oscillation of energy between the reference - state and perturbations develops .",
    "figures 3(a ) shows such an oscillation between the reference - state ( @xmath76 ) kinetic energy ( @xmath79 ) and the perturbation ( @xmath80 ) kinetic energy ( @xmath81 ) , for a perturbation of about 40% in the differential rotation ( angular measure , i.e. @xmath82 ) , for the case of @xmath71 .",
    "similar oscillations occur in @xmath43 case .    the same period and phase of oscillation occurs between the reference state ( @xmath83 ) and perturbation ( @xmath84 ) potential energies in the system , but with substantially smaller amplitude than for the kinetic energy .",
    "we see that during this oscillation the total energy of the system remains virtually constant , which shows that the numerical viscosity in the system is extremely small .",
    "in fact , the total kinetic and total potential energies are separately constant , so that the energy exchanges are strictly between reference state and perturbation energies of the same type .",
    "from equation ( 56 ) of dikpati & gilman ( 2001 ) we can infer that this oscillation is driven by the time dependent reynolds stress of the perturbations .",
    "initially this stress extracts kinetic energy from the differential rotation , which is modified in such a way as to reduce the energy available for continued growth in the disturbance .",
    "but the system then overshoots an equilibrium state , resulting at later phases in the oscillation in the perturbations giving back kinetic energy to the differential rotation .",
    "then the perturbations are able to grow again , and the oscillation repeats . in  3.4 we will show how the disturbance structure changes during the oscillation .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows how the oscillation period depends on the initial perturbation amplitude .",
    "the relationship is obviously not linear .",
    "the process that causes this behavior is also nonlinear .",
    "physically what is happening is that as the initial perturbation amplitude is increased , energy is extracted from the differential rotation at a faster rate .",
    "this modifies the differential rotation profile faster to a form that is less unstable to the perturbation and subsequently to a form that extracts energy from the perturbation .",
    "this makes the period shorter .",
    "there is probably a limit to how short the period can be , as evidenced by the curve in figure 3b approaching an asymptote in period that is greater than zero .",
    "conversely for very low initial amplitude the period gets longer , but probably not to infinity because the initial growth is exponential ( and the rate is independent of the small amplitude ) .",
    "it simply takes longer for the growing disturbance to reach a point in time at which the feedback from the modified differential rotation is strong enough to limit further growth .",
    "we have seen above that the kinetic and potential energies of the nonlinear shallow water system go through a well defined oscillation .",
    "how is this manifested in the changes in the differential rotation profile ?",
    "figures 4a , b show its behavior for the same time period , for both high @xmath2 ( frame a ) and low @xmath2 ( frame b ) , for a 40% initial disturbance amplitude . here",
    "is plotted the angular velocity in the shell for five later times , compared with the initial profile ( black curve ) .",
    "all angular velocities are taken relative to the core rotation rate .",
    "we see in figure 4 that the changes in angular velocity with time are much larger in high than in low latitudes .",
    "this is because it is angular momentum that is being transported in latitude by the reynolds stresses of the perturbations , and the moment of inertia and volume of high latitudes is much smaller than that of low latitudes .",
    "so depositing a given amount of angular momentum in high latitudes causes the angular velocity to rise much more there than it falls in low altitudes .",
    "it follows that if this instability is active in the solar tachocline , the observed high latitude angular velocity changes would be much larger than those in low latitudes . to date ,",
    "helioseismic measurements have not been able to tell us whether this is so , because high latitudes are very hard to observe .    for both high and low @xmath2",
    ", the peak high latitude angular velocity is reached within a little over one month after the initial disturbance is introduced .",
    "thereafter it fluctuates , but about a distinctly higher polar angular velocity than in the initial state .",
    "the polar angular velocity is significantly higher for low @xmath2 than high .",
    "we reason below that this is because with low @xmath2 it is easier for the mass distribution in the shell to be rearranged by meridional flow .",
    "the detailed time history of the amplitude of the polar angular velocity does not precisely match the rather smooth oscillation seen in figure 3 .",
    "this is not surprising , because the time variation seen in figure 3 is of global integrals of the energy , while the polar rotation changes are for a very small part of the volume of the global shell .",
    "we can illustrate and explain the physical processes involved in the evolution of the differential rotation by using equations ( 60)-(62 ) of dikpati & gilman ( 2001 ) , which we repeat here , rearranged so that only the time derivatives are on the left hand sides .",
    "@xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87    the forcing functions @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are defined as , @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93    here the variables are @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which represent respectively the departures of linear rotational velocity , meridional flow , and layer thickness from their initial values .",
    "@xmath97 is the angular velocity of the core , and @xmath98 is cosine of the latitude . from above definitions",
    ", one can see that @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are quadratic functions that contain the covariances or stresses from the perturbation variables @xmath99 .",
    "equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) are , respectively , the equations of motion for differential rotation and meridional flow , and equation ( 15 ) is the mass continuity equation , all for the longitudinal wavenumber @xmath76 variables .",
    "figure 5 displays profiles of layer thickness , meridional flow and angular velocity at the same times as shown in figure 4b .",
    "thickness ( solid purple curve ) and latitudinal flow ( solid green curve ) are shown in frames ( a ) through ( e ) , along with the initial thickness ( dashed purple curve ) for reference .",
    "note that initial meridional flow ( dashed green curve ) is zero .",
    "the differential rotation angular velocity ( thick black curve ) is shown in frames ( f)-(j ) , together with the initial differential rotation ( thin curve ) .",
    "if we compare the thickness and latitudinal flow profiles as time advances , we can see clearly that initially the thickness shrinks near the poles but later rises again as the oscillation progresses .",
    "consistently , the meridional flow is away from the poles while the thickness is declining there , and toward the poles while the polar thickness is rebounding . the same relationship between meridional flow and thickness , dictated by mass conservation ,",
    "can be seen at all other latitudes .",
    "when the polar thickness is declining , the polar angular velocity is increasing .",
    "the physical processes that govern these correlated changes among thickness , meridional flow and differential rotation are contained in equations ( 13)-(15 ) above ( see @xcite ) . in brief , what happens during the nonlinear oscillation is that , through @xmath88 ( equation 13 ) the perturbation reynolds stress transports angular momentum toward the poles to cause a spin - up , or higher linear and angular velocity there . in the meridional flow equation ( 14 ) , this spin up leads to a negative ( equatorward ) coriolis force that pushes fluid away from the pole toward the equator .",
    "this mass flow then produces a positive latitudinal pressure gradient force , which is expressed as a thickness gradient in a shallow - water model .",
    "this force starts to counterbalance the coriolis force .",
    "this rebalancing of forces will reduce the equatorward meridional flow , but in our nearly dissipation free system , it overshoots , causing the meridional flow to reverse and rebuild the polar thickness . at the same time , the changed differential rotation profile is less unstable to the perturbations , or even stable to them , so the reynolds stresses get much weaker , and the polar latitudes spin down again . throughout this sequence of changes , the mass continuity equation ( 15 )",
    "ensures that the changes in thickness are consistent with the changes in meridional flow .",
    "we can better understand the nonlinear dynamics of the shallow water system by examining the planforms ( longitude - latitude ) of the flow and thickness as they evolve .",
    "figure 6 displays these quantities for the same times as in figures 4b and 5 ( low @xmath2 , 0.5 ) .",
    "the left hand column displays the total flow and total thickness fields ( blue is thinest , red thickest ) ; the right hand column shows all of the @xmath80 fields , after subtracting out the axisymmetric parts of the differential rotation , meridional flow and axisymmetric thickness .    from both columns",
    "we can see that the @xmath1 mode dominates in the flow and thickness patterns , leading to a meandering of the e - w flow . as time progresses ,",
    "more structure and somewhat finer spatial scales develop , as we should expect from the behavior of the energy spectrum shown in figure 2 .",
    "we can also see from both columns that the flow is predominantly geostrophic , that is in the north there is counterclockwise circulation around the blue ( thinest ) areas , clockwise around the red ( thickest ) areas ; the reverse is true in the south .",
    "since the pressure in the shallow water system is hydrostatic , it is proportional to the thickness , so the counterclockwise flow in the north is around low pressure , the clockwise flow around high pressure .",
    "from the right hand column we can see that in the first 1 - 2 months the disturbances are transporting angular momentum toward the poles to spin them up , as seen in figure 4b .",
    "the velocity and thickness patterns are tilted with respect to the e - w direction in such a way that the fluid elements moving toward the east in the disturbance are also moving toward the poles , while those moving toward the west ( relative to the rotating reference frame ) are moving toward the equator .",
    "this means there is a correlation between the two velocity components that is the reynolds stress , which is carrying out the poleward angular momentum transport .    by 2.1 months , these tilts",
    "are virtually gone , indicating angular momentum is no longer being transported toward the poles .",
    "this is consistent with the profiles of differential rotation shown in figure 4 , in which the maximum amount of polar spin - up is reached between 1.3 and 2.1 months in these selected cases . by six months ,",
    "the perturbation patterns have become more complex , and it is difficult to discern which way the angular momentum transport is going .",
    "but from figure 3 there is still a pronounced amplitude oscillation between the perturbations and the differential rotation and meridional flow . in this nearly dissipation - free system",
    "there does not appear to be an absolutely steady nonlinear state .",
    "instead there is a dynamical equilibrium with continuous evolution of all flow patterns within a nonlinear regime in which the high latitude rotation rate , while fluctuating , is almost always faster than in the initial state .    in figure 7",
    ", we repeat the twelve frames ( figure 6a - l ) in mollweide projection .",
    "this figure captures a more realistic look of the global disturbance patterns , particularly at and near the poles . in latitude - longitude plots , the single point at each pole",
    "is spread out over @xmath100 longitude .",
    "figure 7 reveals all the features of the disturbances seen in figure 6 , but also reveals more clearly that the flow spreads over both hemispheres crossing the equator .      to illustrate further the range of nonlinear behavior of the shallow water system",
    ", we have performed an additional numerical experiment in which we have chosen a combination of differential rotation ( @xmath101 ) and effective gravity ( @xmath43 ) that we know from linear theory is stable to perturbations , and initially perturbed the system with a disturbance calculated for an unstable case .",
    "the amplitude of perturbation used is 20% of the reference state differential rotation . shown in figure 8 is the resulting differential rotation evolution sampled at the same times as in previous cases .",
    "here we see that in the first few days of the integration , the disturbance starts to spin up the poles ( red curve ) because the reynolds stress in it transports angular momentum toward the poles . but this trend is very short - lived , as the stable differential rotation modifies the disturbance , changing the sign of its reynolds stress by changing the sense of tilt of the perturbation velocities with respect to the e - w direction .",
    "consequently for the next two months of the integration , the poles actually spin down to lower rotation than they had initially , ( light green curve ) while the kinetic energy of the differential rotation is increased at the expense of the energy in the disturbance .",
    "but this , too , is a transient , and by seven months the rotation at high latitudes has returned to very close to its initial profile ( dark blue curve ) .",
    "the details of how the disturbance evolves with time is shown in figure 9 , which gives longitude - latitude planforms of velocity and shell thickness .",
    "the three frames are for , respectively , @xmath102 and 49.8 ( 0 , 1.3 months , and 6 months ) .",
    "we see that in this succession of frames the tilt of the velocity vectors with respect to a latitude circle changes orientation twice , as the associated reynolds stress changes sign twice , signifying first poleward , then equatorward , then poleward momentum transport again .",
    "this is what causes the poles to spin up , then spin down , then up again .",
    "since linear studies @xcite indicate that the low differential amplitudes ( @xmath103 ) are stable in the radiative tachocline with high @xmath2 , we considered a case with @xmath101 and @xmath43 in this subsection . in linear studies",
    "shallow - water gravity modes were extracted out from the calculation and only shear modes were explored .",
    "however , we have no such freedom in the case of nonlinear evolution of a shear profile in the radiative tachocline fluid shell with high @xmath2 .",
    "consequently we see the appearance of gravity modes in the evolution discussed in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the generation and evolution of gravity modes is a vast subject of research itself .",
    "a forthcoming paper will address the generation of shallow - water gravity modes due to nonadjustment of geostrophic balance when the effective gravity of the system is high .",
    "we have presented above the first fully nonlinear shallow water numerical model to be applied to the sun .",
    "it is intended for use in understanding the global dynamics of solar and stellar tachoclines .",
    "it provides a beginning and template for later models that will include global mhd effects ; solar tachoclines most likely contain strong global scale magnetic fields , particularly toroidal fields .",
    "this spectral model needs only extremely low numerical diffusion to keep the solutions well behaved , so it is particularly well suited to simulation of strongly nonlinear time dependent hydrodynamics and mhd of the sun .",
    "the equations conserve energy with extremely high accuracy ( @xmath104% ) , so that very long simulations are possible without significant spurious build - up of kinetic or potential energy at small scales .",
    "substantial increases in both computational efficiency and accuracy are obtained by use of a mechanism for adjusting the time step during a simulation .",
    "since the model does include the radial dimension in a simple way , by means of a deforming top surface , it contains gravity wave modes as well as shearing instabilities of the differential rotation .",
    "it also allows for a simplified form of meridional flow that is coupled to and causes the changes in the thickness of the spherical shell .",
    "thus it is possible with this model to study rather complex fluid dynamics , including interplay between the relatively low frequency global shearing flows and instabilities , and the higher frequency gravity waves made possible by the deforming top boundary .",
    "the low dissipation in the model is of particular value for simulating the global dynamics of the radiative tachocline that is found below the overshooting layer of the convection zone above .",
    "but it is equally valuable for simulations applied to the overshoot tachocline , whose differential rotation is maintained by downward diffusion from the convection zone .    our first results from this nonlinear model focus primarily on the nonlinear interactions between unstable global perturbations previously found from linear analyses and the differential rotation that gives rise to them .",
    "we show that the nonlinear dynamics result in a spin - up of polar regions due to the reynolds stress associated with the growing disturbances , and also substantial nonlinear oscillations between disturbance and differential rotation kinetic energy .",
    "the oscillation occurs because as the disturbances extract energy and transport momentum to high latitudes , the differential rotation profile changes in such a way as to reduce and even shut off the instability .",
    "at least temporarily there can occur a reversal in direction of angular momentum transport , which rebuilds energy in the differential rotation .",
    "the simulations go through a sequence of these oscillations without settling to a steady state .",
    "this is because the system is virtually dissipation - free due to the implementation of numerical scheme with very little spectral viscosity . throughout this evolution ,",
    "the longitude - latitude planform of the disturbances on the differential rotation , as well as the total flow , undergoes considerable evolution as well as propagation in longitude .",
    "the changes in angular velocity with time in polar latitudes are much larger than the compensating changes in low latitudes , because the moment of inertia and volume of polar latitudes is much smaller than in low and mid - latitudes .",
    "the period of the nonlinear oscillation is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the initial perturbations , apparently with finite asymptotic periods for both very large and very small initial disturbance energies . throughout these oscillations",
    "the disturbance kinetic energy remains confined primarily to the lowest longitudinal wave numbers , @xmath105 , or the largest global scales .",
    "the simulations contain gravity waves of significant amplitude particularly when the effective gravity ( @xmath2 ) of the system is high ; their role will be addressed in a later paper .",
    "the solutions also contain kinetic helicity due to the correlation between the local radial component of vorticity and the radial motion associated with changes in the thickness of the shell .",
    "kinetic helicity is of particular importance for the solar dynamo , and will also be studied in more detail in a later paper . in the sun the differential rotation of the tachocline is imposed from the convection zone above .",
    "we will generalize our model to include this forcing in later studies .",
    "this will add still another time scale to the problem , namely the time it takes for the top forcing to restore the differential rotation .",
    "all of the additional studies just described are for the hydrodynamic model we have already built .",
    "the major step beyond that system is to include global mhd processes , which will without doubt substantially modify the hydrodynamic processes we have studied or will study soon .",
    "a still later step will be to couple this model to a global 3d flux transport dynamo model for the sun , that will be capable of addressing the question of the origin of active longitudes @xcite as well as how such longitudinally dependent features and processes contribute the origin and evolution of solar cycles .",
    "the coupling would involve flow generated in the tachocline reaching into the convection zone above and generating 3d mhd induction effects .",
    "thus there is a need to develop a viscous shallow - water model in order to be able to couple the tachocline instabilities with a global , flux - transport dynamo model in the solar convective envelope .",
    "in addition , it is necessary for the magnetic fields in the tachocline to connect with that in the convection zone above , continuously through the interface between the tachocline and the convection zone .",
    "to implement such a connection among magnetic fields at different layers , through the interfaces among the layers , we would follow the way as described in the figure 1 and equation ( 22 ) of @xcite .",
    "we thank phil judge for reviewing the entire manuscript and for his helpful comments .",
    "we extend our thanks to yuhong fan for helpful discussions on artificial viscosity in an inviscid model versus viscous model with physical diffusion , to peter gilman for many helpful discussions on the topic of this paper , and to an anonymous reviewer for his / her constructive comments and suggestions , which have helped improve this paper .",

    "in the case of primitive equations such as equations ( 8)-(10 ) , the vector field ( flow ) and the scalar field ( height ) need to be expanded respectively in terms of vector and scalar spherical harmonics , in order to handle the pole problem .",
    "pure scalar harmonics can also be used by converting all the vector fields into scalar fields , but at the expense of raising the order of the equations .",
    "following the solution method of @xcite ( see method 2 there ) , the spectral decomposition of scalar @xmath13 can be expressed as @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the associated legendre polynomial of order @xmath109 .",
