    "directional solidification ( ds ) of binary alloys is a reference experimental method to conduct carefully controlled tests of industrial casting . besides their practical interest",
    ", ds experiments also bring insight into the fundamental study of basic instability morphologies of solid - liquid interfaces , such as cells or dendrites @xcite . by the combination of theoretical and numerical methods ,",
    "much progress has been now achieved toward solving this difficult physical problem .",
    "however , most of the theoretical effort has concentrated so far on continuous descriptions of the underlying phenomena @xcite .",
    "in contrast , attempts to attack the problem at the atomistic level remain very few . to this extent",
    ", the present study may be considered as a first step to bridge the gap between both points of view .    because of the micrometer size of the growth structures , a direct and quantitative atomistic simulation is still not at hand on this scale . nevertheless , in the limit of large pulling velocities , a microscopic technique like molecular dynamics ( md ) can still be used to follow atomistic phenomena occuring close to the solid - liquid interface .",
    "on one hand , md was used to simulate laser - pulsed melting , for which the velocity is not controlled , but rather governed by heat diffusion . @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a first md simulation of directed growth has been recently reported by coura and al .",
    "they considered the growth of a solid from a fluid phase with a density ten times smaller , a case which is probably more relevant to deposition from a vapor .    in this paper , we present non - equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations of directional solidification in two dimensions .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of rapid solidification with a large temperature gradient , for which the interface remains plane on the atomistic scale , so that microstructures will not be considered here . after the description of the simulation details in section",
    "ii , we present in section iii the results obtained for the segregation profiles , the segregation coefficient and the advection velocity . in the last section ,",
    "we finally discuss how this nonequilibrium simulation can be extended in the future to study different microscopic mechanisms involved in ds .",
    "two atoms @xmath3 and @xmath4 separated by a distance @xmath5 interact via the well - known lennard - jones potential : @xmath6\\ ] ] the interaction energies between pairs of solvent - solvent , solute - solute and solvent - solute atoms are respectively denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the solvent potential parameters are chosen in order to describe argon properties ( @xmath10k , @xmath11 ) .",
    "for the solute , we take @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the cross - species parameters are fixed using the lorentz - berthelot rules @xcite : @xmath14 and @xmath15 all the interactions are truncated at a cut - off radius @xmath16 and the equations of motion are integrated using the beeman algorithm @xcite with a time step @xmath17ps .",
    "the particles coordinates are defined in a reference frame moving at the pulling velocity @xmath0 in the @xmath18 direction and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are applied in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions .",
    "after integration of the dynamical equations over a time @xmath20 , pulling is implemented by adding an increment @xmath21 to the @xmath18 coordinate of each atom . in the reference frame ,",
    "the solid - liquid interface is thus immobile when the stationnary state is reached .    to simulate heat transport from the furnace to the system ,",
    "four regions of fixed temperature are used ( fig .",
    "[ temp_prof ] ) .",
    "regions i , ii , iii and iv are centered at fixed positions , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and have a width of @xmath26 for regions i and iv and @xmath27 for regions ii and iii . in each region",
    "the temperature is kept constant by using a classical velocity rescaling .",
    "to maintain the solidification front between region ii and iii , we impose @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the melting temperature of the alloy .    in fig .",
    "[ temp_prof ] we represent the temperature gradient obtained after equilibration in the simulation box .",
    "the large difference between @xmath31 and @xmath32 and hence the large gradient permits to localize the interface easily . with such a high gradient , instabilities can not develop , which ensures the stability of planar interfaces .",
    "for the same reason we also take a small width @xmath33 for the simulation box in order to reduce the natural roughness of the interface .",
    "more realistic systems , as compared to experiments , would correspond to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , together with a larger value of @xmath33 .",
    "because of the pbc in the @xmath18 direction , we simultaneously have a solidification and a melting front , as in a melting zone experiment .",
    "we concentrate here on the solidification front and we use a wide liquid zone ( @xmath36 ) to allow solute diffusion . fixing the temperature in four regions instead of two reduces considerably the rescaling of velocities within the liquid region .",
    "this is helpful to suppress pertubations and artefacts during the computation of microscopic quantities .",
    "the density difference between the solid and the liquid ( @xmath37 ) is sufficient to induce advection of the liquid towards the front .",
    "a part of the associated momentum is then transmitted to the solid layer which in turn acquires a translationnal motion in the @xmath18 direction . to avoid this finite - size effect , we rescale to zero the mean velocity within the deeper part of the solid ( region i ) .",
    "our system contains about @xmath38 atoms , 10 percent of which are solute atoms .",
    "its size , @xmath39 in length and @xmath40 in width , is relatively modest as compared to the size of systems currently used in md .",
    "the reason is that the computational effort is here essentially spent in the time length of the simulation . to obtain good statistics ,",
    "the simulation has to be long enough to allow each atom to perform several solidification - melting cycles . since ten cycles require a time of @xmath41 , for the slowest velocity studied here ( @xmath42cms@xmath2 ) , this represents a simulation time of @xmath43s ( @xmath44 md steps ) . to increase the performance of our code",
    "we then adopt the cell lists method @xcite in which the box is divided into cells with a size slighty larger than the cutoff radius @xmath45 .",
    "the partition ratio , or segregation coefficient , is defined as @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the concentrations at the interface , respectively in the liquid and the solid . with our choice of the potential parameters ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 is expected to be less than one @xcite , so that solute accumulates in the liquid near the front .",
    "we first illustrate how the simulation reproduces solute rejection .",
    "the pulling velocity is fixed to @xmath51ms@xmath2 and the solute atoms are initially placed at random in the simulation box .",
    "[ deux_photos]a is a snapshot of the system in its initial configuration . after a time @xmath52ns , which corresponds to a spatial translation of the furnace of approximatly @xmath53 ,",
    "the second snapshot ( fig [ deux_photos]b ) shows that almost all the solvent atoms initially close to the front are incorporated into the solid .",
    "conversely , because of their poorer solubility in the solid phase , a majority of the solute atoms remain in the liquid phase .",
    "as compared to a solvent atom , it takes a longer time for a solute atom to cross the interface and hence the solute concentration is higher at the interface , as expected here . to quantify this segregation ,",
    "we compute the profile concentration by averaging over @xmath54 uncorrelated spatial configurations ( fig .",
    "[ prof ] ) .",
    "the diffusion equation for the solute in the moving frame reads @xmath55 in the stationary regime , it gives the well known theoretical profile for the solute concentration in the liquid , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the diffusion length and the origin of the @xmath18 axis is placed at the front .",
    "a good agreement is found between this expression and our simulations , the best fit giving a diffusion coefficient @xmath58 . to verify this value",
    ", we independently compute the diffusion coefficient profile @xmath59 , with the help of einstein s relation between the mean square displacement of the atoms and @xmath60 , @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ dif ] , we see that the diffusion coefficient increases abruptly between zero in the solid phase to roughly @xmath62 in the liquid near the interface . this variation of @xmath60 takes place over a distance of @xmath63 that can be considered as a good aproximation of the interface width . in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath60 was assumed constant .",
    "we can check that the fitted value @xmath64 approximately corresponds to the average of @xmath59 within the liquid region near the interface .",
    "the same analysis is repeated for different pulling velocities between @xmath65ms@xmath2 and @xmath66ms@xmath2 . for each velocity ,",
    "we compute the concentration profile and extract @xmath64 from the diffusion length . in fig .",
    "[ dfctv ] , @xmath64 is plotted as a function of the pulling velocity . as discussed below , the segregation coefficient tends to unity for the largest @xmath0 and the calculation of @xmath64 is thus restricted to velocities @xmath67ms@xmath2 .",
    "a reasonable agreement is found in each case between @xmath64 and the average value of the @xmath59 profile .    in fig [ 2prof ] , we plot the two concentration profiles obtained for @xmath51ms@xmath2 and @xmath68ms@xmath2",
    ". as expected , the smaller the velocity , the larger @xmath69 .",
    "if the agreement with the exponential law is good for the largest velocity , we notice that it is less satisfactory for the smaller one .",
    "this can be understood by a second look at fig .",
    "we observe that the thermal gradient induces an increase of the diffusion coefficient , as we go deeper in the liquid . as a consequence",
    ", we also have an increase of the diffusion length , which explains the disagreement observed for the largest @xmath18 values .      now that we verified the ability of our method to reproduce both the segregation at the interface and the dependence of the diffusion length on the pulling velocity",
    ", we examine the behavior of the segregation coefficient @xmath50 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ 2prof ] that the liquid concentration at the interface , @xmath47 , is larger for a lower value of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be easily explained by the fact that , at large pulling velocities , the solute does not have enough time to fully diffuse over the interface width before it is incorporated into the solid . as a consequence",
    ", some solute is trapped in the solid and segregation at the interface is lowered .",
    "several models have been proposed to describe solute - trapping @xcite .",
    "the usual qualitative criterion for segregation is to compare two different characteristic times .",
    "one , @xmath70 , corresponds to the growth of the solid over a distance comparable to the interface width , @xmath71 .",
    "the second , @xmath72 , is the time needed for a solute atom to diffuse over the same distance @xmath71 .",
    "the aziz model @xcite predicts then @xmath73 for the segregation coefficient . here",
    "@xmath74 is the segregation coefficient at equilibrium ( i.e. , when @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 is the ratio of the two characteristic times ( or lengths ) defined above .",
    "two remarks arise at this point .",
    "the first one concerns the neighborhood of the absolute stability threshold , @xmath77 , where the diffusion length becomes comparable to the capillary length , @xmath78 .",
    "when @xmath79 , one also has @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 .",
    "in this case , the absolute stability threshold is well described by the usual linear stability analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is not true anymore , when @xmath82 becomes comparable to @xmath71 , as it is very likely the case for some reference alloys @xcite .",
    "the second remark is that the assumption of continuous growth , on which eq .",
    "( 8) relies , is actually verified by the rough solid - liquid interfaces produced with our lennard - jones potential .    in fig [ k ]",
    "we plot our estimates for @xmath50 as a function of the pulling velocity .",
    "the line is a best fit to the aziz model .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 is estimated by using @xmath84 , the characteristic width of the interface extracted from the @xmath59 profile in fig.[dif ] and the value of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath85ps@xmath2 is estimated at the center of this interface region .",
    "the agreement between the simulated values and the model is rather good for a fit with a single free parameter .",
    "we obtain the value @xmath86 which is difficult to confirm because it is not possible to simulate segregation at much lower velocities with current computing power .",
    "simulations at a fixed pulling velocity thus provide an indirect way of determining @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that the interface is moving permits all atoms , and especially the solute ones , to be part of the fluid phase and then to speed up relaxation to the equilibrium situation . for an immobile interface",
    ", one would have to wait for the very slow diffusion of solute atoms within the solid phase .",
    "the solid - liquid equilibrium for 3d binary lennard - jones mixtures has been determined by monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to have similar 2d results available to test our indirect evaluation of @xmath74 .",
    "we finally study the advection of the fluid near the solidification front .",
    "the lennard - jones mixture considered in this work produces a substantial density difference between the solid and the liquid .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dens ] , where we plot the density profile along the @xmath18 direction perpendicular to the interface . from these data , we estimate both densities at the interface , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we find that they do not depend on the pulling velocity and that the normalized density difference is also a constant , @xmath89 .",
    "this rather high value for a lennard - jones potential is due to the large temperature gradient imposed at the interface . as a consequence",
    ", the solid can not grow unless the liquid is advected toward the front with a velocity @xmath90 . in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the solid is at rest , while the liquid has an advection velocity @xmath90 all along the @xmath18 axix ( fig .",
    "[ vprof ] ) .",
    "mass conservation at the interface imposes that @xmath91 varies with @xmath0 as @xmath92 a linear variation is effectively recovered in our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ vad ] ) , with a slope comparing well to the estimate extracted from the density profile ( see fig . [ dens ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is no deviation from the linear law , even at the highest velocities studied in this work .",
    "on one side , one could have expected that the onset of solute trapping would modify the densities .",
    "this is not the case here , probably because the solvent and solute atoms have the same atomic radius , @xmath13 . on the other side",
    ", a deviation would also appear as @xmath0 is increased , if the solid was created with more and more defects .",
    "we would then have a decrease of @xmath91 because the density of the solid would also decrease .",
    "this type of deviation is not observed any more in our simulations .",
    "we finally see in fig .",
    "[ vprof ] that the advection velocity increases in magnitude with @xmath18 .",
    "as we go deeper in the liquid , the density progressively decreases in the thermal gradient and an extra advection velocity is thus necessary to compensate the density drop between two adjacent slices of alloy .",
    "with the help of md simulations , we directly observed and analyzed quantitatively two important phenomena occuring at the atomistic level in rapid ds .",
    "the first one is the cross - over between the regime of solute segregation and the regime of solute trapping , which sets in as the pulling velocity , @xmath0 , is increased .",
    "the good quantitative agreement of our estimates for the segregation coefficient , @xmath93 , with existing theories @xcite confirmed that md is a valuable simulation tool for ds .",
    "the second point is the advection of the liquid phase towards the solidification front .",
    "the advection velocity at the interface was shown to remain proportional to @xmath0 , in the whole range of values considered here .",
    "this effect is more likely masked by stronger phenoma like convection in the usual experimental set - ups .",
    "it may however become relevant in micro - gravity or for thin sample ds .",
    "the use of lennard - jones potentials is rather restrictive to compare the present results with experiments . in the future , potentials based on empirical descriptions , like the embedded atom method @xcite",
    ", the glue model @xcite , or the effective medium theory @xcite will be used to study technical materials like metals .",
    "this will allow us to explore important issues like anisotropy and facetting , or the role of defects and constraints . in parallel",
    ", it will be necessary to simulate more extended systems , in order to explore the front instabilities from an atomistic point of view . in this last category",
    ", we can cite the oscillations of the solidification front just above the absolute stability velocity @xcite ."
