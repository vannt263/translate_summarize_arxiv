    "to investigate the properties of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy ion collision experiments , theoretical prospects are significant , since such processes include complicated interactions among large number of particles .",
    "changes of charmonium states have been regarded as one of the most important probes of plasma formation @xcite , because the potential model calculations predict the mass shift of charmonium near @xmath0 @xcite , and @xmath1 suppression above @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , lattice qcd simulations have indicated that the thermal properties of hadronic correlators are much more involved than weakly interacting almost free quarks @xcite .",
    "recent studies of spectral functions of charmonium suggest that a hadronic excitation of @xmath2-@xmath3 system may survives above @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this seems to conflict with the predictions of potential model approaches and a naive picture of qgp .    in this study",
    "we discuss the above disagreement between the spectral function analysis and the potential model . on one hand",
    ", we extract the information of the spectral function from the temporal charmonium correlator . on the other hand",
    ", we also extract the static quark potentials from the color singlet polyakov loop correlation and wilson loop .",
    "the result of potential model calculation using the latter is compared with the former .",
    "these calculation are performed on quenched anisotropic lattices .",
    "this enables simulations at temperatures from @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) to 1.75@xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) keeping the lattice cutoff unique , to avoid uncertainties caused by the cutoff dependence in , for example , self - energy contribution to the potentials .",
    "the anisotropic lattice is also useful to keep the number of data points of the temporal correlators sufficiently large , which is important for detailed analysis of the spectral functions .",
    "we extend the simulation reported in ref .",
    "@xcite which was performed at the renormalized anisotropy @xmath7 , the spatial lattice cutoff is @xmath8gev , and with the plaquette gauge and @xmath9 improved wilson quark actions .",
    "the critical temperature almost corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "to extract the spectral function from the temporal correlators , we adopt the maximum entropy method ( mem ) and the constrained curve fitting ( ccf ) @xcite .",
    "the result of the former provides the prior knowledge required for the latter . combining the two methods , the results may be more reliable and quantitative than with one of them . in our previous study @xcite we found that mem fails to extract the spectral function from the correlator of local operators at @xmath11 . therefore we adopt spatially extended operators to enhance the low frequency mode of the spectral function .",
    "however the smeared operators may lead to an artificial peak , and thus careful analysis is necessary to distinguish the physical results from the artifact ones .",
    "although our mem result shows that the spectral functions have peak structure in ps and v channels ( corresponding to @xmath12 and @xmath1 ) at all temperature , the difference of result for different smearing functions , we call `` smeared '' and `` half - smeared '' , exists at higher temperature , especially above @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the peak structure of the spectral function at high temperature might be artificial .",
    "furthermore we find large default model function dependence of the results , in which the position of the peak is stable but the peak width has large dependence .",
    "therefore it is difficult to study the spectral function quantitatively using only mem .",
    "ccf analysis is performed based on the result of mem , assuming the form of fitting function as the breit - wigner type , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are overlap , mass and width of the @xmath18-th peak respectively , and @xmath19 is used in this analysis .",
    "the result of lowest peak position ( mass ) and width are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "unfortunately , our results of the ccf is unstable against the prior knowledge as inputs .",
    "therefore the systematic uncertainties will be larger than the quoted statistical error in fig.[fig1 ] .    , and width , @xmath20 , from the result of ccf analysis.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , and width , @xmath20 , from the result of ccf analysis.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in spite of large systematic uncertainty , we can find the following tendency .",
    "below @xmath0 , the spectral function has a peak with almost the same mass at @xmath21 and vanishing width . above @xmath0 ,",
    "the peak stays at similar position as at @xmath22 while its width tends to grow as temperature increases .",
    "as pointed out in the mem analysis , however , the difference between the results of smeared and half - smeared correlators shows that a disappearance of the peak structure at higher @xmath23 can not be excluded , especially in the v channel .",
    "in this section we compare the results of spectral function with the potential model calculation . here",
    "we define the following potentials .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are polyakov and wilson loops , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is adopted in the former potential model calculations .",
    "@xmath28 can not define in gauge independent form , then we calculate it in the coulomb gauge , in which the @xmath28 will be equivalent with a gauge invariant definition @xcite",
    ". we can also define the other color singlet potential using the wilson loops , @xmath29 , which is calculated with the same way as at zero temperature .",
    "@xmath30 is thermal average of the energy spectrum of the color singlet @xmath31 system , while @xmath32 is the lowest one of the spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the result of @xmath33 below and above @xmath0 respectively . above @xmath0 ,",
    "unfortunately , we fail to extract the @xmath34 and present only @xmath28 in the bottom panel .",
    "we note that our results of @xmath27 are consistent with previous studies , and draws the same conclusions as refs .",
    "@xcite .     and",
    "@xmath34 , below and above @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath21 result is also shown in both figures.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and @xmath34 , below and above @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath21 result is also shown in both figures.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    we solve the schrdinger equation using the quark potential parametrized to the form , @xmath35 .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the result for the differences of binding energies from @xmath21 .",
    "below @xmath0 , the ccf analysis found the mass difference of @xmath36 mev .",
    "corresponding results of the potential model with @xmath28 deviate from the ccf results , while those of @xmath34 agree . above @xmath0 , @xmath28",
    "can hold a bound state up to @xmath37 , while at higher temperatures can not , or at least the wave function become too broad compared to the spatial lattice size .       in summary ,",
    "the disagreement between the results of spectral function analysis and the potential model is qualitatively absent if one uses the color singlet free energy as the static quark potential .",
    "this is the same conclusion as the bielefeld group @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of the quark potential indicated that the potential from the wilson loop most well reproduces the result of spectral function analysis below @xmath0 .",
