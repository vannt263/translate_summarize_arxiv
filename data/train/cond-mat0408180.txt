    "the hamiltonian for fermions with spin @xmath1 and pseudospin @xmath2 , coupled to phonons , is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a nearest neighbor tunneling term for the fermions @xmath5 and @xmath6 is local , containing a ( hubbard ) interaction and a term for dispersionless phonons of energy @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 where the plus ( minus ) sign refers to holstein ( @xmath0 jahn - teller ) electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 is diagonalized by a lang - firsov transformation @xcite and has energies e_0 = _ 0 n_-e_p ^2 + _ un_un_+u_o ( n_u+n _ ) ( n_u+n _ ) [ energy0 ] if there are @xmath11 phonons and @xmath12 electrons with ( pseudo)spin @xmath1 ( @xmath13 ) at site @xmath14 .",
    "each electron has an energy gain @xmath15 .",
    "the regime @xmath16 has an attractive interaction , leading to an on - site bipolaron .",
    "to study the binding properties of polarons we consider two electrons on a lattice with two orbitals ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) per lattice site . in a strong coupling approach",
    "we study the similarities and differences of the non - degenerate holstein - hubbard ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) ( hh ) and the @xmath0-jahn - teller - hubbard model ( jth ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of repulsive on - site interaction ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore the ground state of @xmath6 has single occupied sites .",
    "if both electrons are in the same orbital , the situation is the same as in the hh @xcite due to the orbital conserving hopping .",
    "we show in the following , however , that the situation for electrons in the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 orbitals is different .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that we have a different distortion configuration associated with different orbitals .    for a hypercubic lattice",
    "a hopping expansion leads to an exponentially reduced hopping rate @xmath22 in first order .",
    "the results in second order for each possible hopping process can be written in general as -e^-_n=1^ -e^-_n=0^=-e^-(a , b )  .",
    "the first series is the result of processes with empty and singly - occupied sites as excited states , while the second series takes doubly - occupied states into account .",
    "@xmath23 is related to the incomplete gamma function @xcite . for electrons in the same orbital @xmath24",
    "is equal to @xmath25 and for different orbital occupation @xmath24 is given as @xmath26 .",
    "values of @xmath27 are @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the positive sign corresponds only to processes that describe hopping in different orbitals .",
    "one process takes place in the @xmath17 , the other in the @xmath18 orbital .",
    "hence they only appear in the jth but not in the hh .",
    "the terms related to the processes explained above are related to processes that change the orbital occupancy at least at one site .",
    "this means , for instance , that the initial state has an electron in orbital @xmath17 and the final state an electron in orbital @xmath18 at one site",
    ". only the electrons at nearest neighbor sites are available for these processes .",
    "if both hopping processes take place in the same orbital the minus sign appears .",
    "these are the only contributions in the hh .",
    "they also exist in the jth if either both electrons are in the same orbital or if only one of the two electrons moves .",
    "the factor @xmath30 arises if only two sites are involved in the process . while the series with @xmath31 reduces the exponential prefactor even further , the series with @xmath32 cancel it in part or , in the case of @xmath33 , even completely .",
    "this means that hopping processes that do not change the lattice configuration , i. e. the orbital occupancy , are not suppressed exponentially in the strong coupling regime .",
    "processes with exchange in the same orbital are included in this case but not those in different orbitals .",
    "the latter change the orbital occupancy and therefore the lattice configuration . in a strong coupling approach",
    "we neglect the exponentially reduced terms . for nearest - neighbor electrons in the same orbital we have the possibility of an exchange , which eventually leads to a nearest - neighbor singlet and triplet configuration as in the hh .",
    "the singlet , a nearest - neighbor bipolaron , is the ground state if @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding binding energy does not dependent on the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "this is an artefact of our approximation , and it is @xmath35 . on the other hand , the exchange of electrons in different orbitals vanishes in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the lowest energy state of electrons in different orbitals is that of unbound polarons , and it is equal to that of unbound polarons in the same orbital .",
    "the nearest neighbor states are higher in energy with a finite energy shift with respect to the unbound states .",
    "for simplicity , the spin of the electron is ignored now .",
    "formally , the orbital has a similar meaning as the spin in the sense that it appears as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "this gives us orbital - depending effects in tunneling , very similar to spin - dependent effects @xcite . in this case",
    "the ground state for sufficiently small hopping rate @xmath36 compared with @xmath37 , @xmath7 and @xmath38 is a singly occupied lattice without phonons .    in the following",
    "we shall consider the green s function @xmath39 and its projection to the subspace with one fermion per lattice site and no phonon @xmath40 .",
    "the green s function satisfies the operator identity @xcite p_0(z - h)^-1p_0= ( p_0(z - h)p_0 - p_0h p_1 ( z - h)_1 ^ -1p_1 hp_0)_0 ^ -1 ( z - p_0h_0p_0 - h_eff)_0 ^ -1 , [ projected ] where @xmath41 projects to the complement : @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the inverse on the projected hilbert space . since the hamiltonian @xmath44 preserves the total number of fermions in the system , the matrix of @xmath44 in fermion - number representation is given by diagonal blocks",
    "consequently , the projected matrix @xmath45 acts only on the hilbert space with a total fermion number equal to the number of lattice sites . in other words ,",
    "all virtual processes in @xmath46 are creation and annihilation processes of pairs of doubly occupied and empty sites .",
    "equation ( [ projected ] ) is a recursion relation on the projected hilbert spaces and can be iterated .",
    "it provides a continued - fraction representation @xcite .",
    "a truncation after the first iteration by replacing @xmath47 in @xmath48 leads to the approximation of @xmath46 by the xxz heisenberg model h_eff_<*j*,*j*>with coupling constants for a lattice with @xmath49 sites @xmath50 for weak and strong electron - phonon coupling we obtain the same behavior for @xmath51 : a_~ but a different behavior for @xmath52 , where a_u~a_  ( g/_01 ) ,   a_u~0  ( g/_01 ) .",
    "thus the weak - coupling limit of @xmath46 gives an isotropic heisenberg model , whereas the strong - coupling limit leads to an ising model .      as a simple example we study the effect of the geometry on properties in the case of a molecule with three atoms ( @xmath53 ) , either in a stretched ( sm ) or triangular ( tm ) configuration .",
    "the hilbert space of the full hamiltonian has infinite dimensions , whereas the hilbert space of the hamiltonian of the projected green s function with one electron per site and no phonon has only dimension @xmath54 .",
    "the problem of diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian is further reduced by the global spin - flip symmetry to @xmath55 .",
    "however , the eigenvalues of @xmath46 are complicated functions of @xmath56 due to the virtual hopping processes which include the creation of an arbitrary number of phonons . the projected green s function of eq .",
    "( [ projected ] ) can be expressed in terms of eigenstates and eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian @xmath46 as @xmath57 the energy functions @xmath58 for the stretched and for the triangular molecule are listed in table [ energies ] .",
    "the geometric degeneracy of the tm gives a doubly degenerate ground state for @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the energy @xmath60 is absent in this case .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      the energy levels of the molecules are poles of the projected green s functions @xmath61 , i.e. they are solutions of the equation @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 appears in @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( and therefore in @xmath63 ) only in the combination @xmath64 . in general",
    ", we expect a complex solution @xmath65 for @xmath66 . however , it turns out from the properties of the incomplete gamma function that the imaginary part is always @xmath67 and that the real part satisfies an equation of the form x=_m   ( c_m0 ,   _",
    "m=_0m-2e_p+u_o ) . consequently",
    ", there are solutions @xmath68 with @xmath69 .      in weak coupling ( wc ) as well as strong coupling ( sc ) ,",
    "the green s functions have only two poles for each @xmath63 .",
    "these poles are solutions of a quadratic equation .",
    "to study all elements of the green s functions in one case , the parameter @xmath70 is introduced such that the green s function reads e_j|(z - h)^-1|e_j= ,  ( z=z+3e_p ) [ gf2 ] with the values of the parameter @xmath70 given in table [ lambda ] .",
    "the poles in eq .",
    "( [ gf2 ] ) are z_1/2=e_p+u_o/2 . the ground state is related to @xmath71 ,",
    "i.e. , it is @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , @xmath70 must be maximal .",
    "thus @xmath59 is the ground state , except for tm / sc , where the ground state has an additional degeneracy due to @xmath73 .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that in the strong coupling regime the main source of bipolaron formation is the non - exponential off - diagonal matrix element in second order related to the exchange of neighboring electrons . in the @xmath0 case we found exponential decay for this exchange in the situation of different orbital occupancy .",
    "therefore the unbound state is preferred . for one particle per site we showed that @xmath46 of the projected green s function yields an xxz heisenberg model .",
    "furthermore it should be noted that the corresponding holstein - hubbard model leads to an isotropic heisenberg term .",
    "this was also discussed for the bipolaron problem @xcite . as an application we have discussed the spectral properties for stretched and triangular molecular configurations of three atoms .",
