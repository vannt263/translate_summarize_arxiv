    "i note that the total ( 6.531.0 ) absorbed flux of @xmath37@xmath35   is comparable with that obtained by @xcite .",
    "the origin of this component is probably connected with the optically thin , a few millions of kelvins hot , collisionally - ionized plasma @xcite , heated by shock waves in the highly - supersonic mass - outflow .",
    "multiwavelength modelling of the sed revealed the simultaneous presence of a warm stellar ( @xmath38 ) and nebular ( @xmath39 ) components of radiation in the spectrum of rs  oph during the first four days after its explosion .",
    "the stellar component is characterized with @xmath40k and @xmath41@xmath42 , which corresponds to production of @xmath43 photons per second that are capable of ionizing hydrogen .",
    "however , the nebular component is characterized with @xmath3@xmath4 , which corresponds to @xmath44 recombinations per second @xmath45 , and thus can not be generated by the observed stellar source of radiation ( @xmath46 ; see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lph ] ) ) .",
    "this implies the presence of a hot ionizing source in the system , which is not seen directly by the outer observer .",
    "such properties of radiative components were revealed in the spectrum of all symbiotic stars with a high orbital inclination during their outbursts .",
    "the corresponding spectrum was called a two - temperature - type ( see sect .  5.3.4 of * ? ? ?",
    "this puts constraints for the ionization and geometrical structure of the circumstellar matter surrounding the burning wd .",
    "according to @xcite the source of the warm stellar component can be ascribed to the wd s pseudophotosphere that is represented by the outer flared rim of an optically thick disk - like formation around the hot star .",
    "the circumstellar material located within the remainder of the sphere is ionized , and thus converts a fraction of the hot star ( here the burning wd ) radiation into the strong nebular emission ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "ever since the very beginning of the nova explosion ( day 1.16 ) , very broad emission lines of hydrogen were observed in the optical spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite fitted the broad wings of h@xmath28  from day 1.38 by the wind model of @xcite , in which a fraction of the wind from the central star is blocked by a disk around the wd s equator , and thus causes its bipolarity .",
    "the very high level of the continuum around the h@xmath28  line of @xmath47@xmath48  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : seds ] , left top panel ) yields its luminosity , @xmath49@xmath50   and the mass loss rate of a few @xmath51@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the h@xmath28  luminosity was generated in a volume with the emission measure _ _",
    "em__@xmath52@xmath4   for @xmath53erg@xmath54s@xmath16 , which is consistent with that of the nebular continuum .",
    "as both the nebular continuum and the hydrogen emission lines originate in the same region , the h  zone , producing the strong nebular component of radiation in the sed , can be ascribed to the fast ionized wind from the outbursting wd .",
    "in addition , the biconical structure and the nature of the ionized zone was also supported by the presence of satellite emission components located at @xmath55kms@xmath16  with respect to the main cores of hydrogen lines , measured from the very beginning of the outburst and being recognizable to day @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "these emission features can be interpreted as a result of highly collimated bipolar mass outflow .",
    "this was confirmed by the radio 43ghz image from day 55 that showed directly highly collimated outflows produced by free - free emission from the thermal plasma @xcite .",
    "the presence of bipolar jets requires the presence of the inner disk , throughout which sufficient amount of mass must be accreted to balance the outflow via the jets ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus the presence of a large disk - like formation encompassing the burning wd could also be responsible for keeping the super - eddington luminosity of the burning wd for a long time .",
    "\\(i ) the bolometric luminosity of the burning wd can not be determined unambiguously during this period of the nova evolution .",
    "only its lower limit can be estimated from the components of radiation determining the observed two - temperature - type of the spectrum .",
    "the disk - like shell around the wd converts a fraction of its radiation into the warm stellar component ( here approximated by blackbody ) .",
    "its luminosity at day @xmath57 was @xmath58@xmath42  ( table  2 ) .",
    "another fraction of the burning wd s luminosity is reprocessed by ionization / recombination events into the nebular component .",
    "its luminosity can be expressed as ( see eq .",
    "( 8) in paper  i ) @xmath59 where the nebula is assumed to radiate under conditions of case  b. the _ em_(day @xmath60@xmath4   corresponds to @xmath61@xmath42 .",
    "this also represents a lower limit , because a fraction of ionizing photons is not detectable ( they are not converted into the nebular photons , i.e. @xmath62 , see appendix  a ) and , in addition , the nebula can be partially optically thick ( i.e. the measured _ em _ is smaller than that originally created by ionizations ) .",
    "thus the bolometric luminosity of the burning wd is @xmath63 at day @xmath57 .",
    "note that such adding of luminosities from different sources to the bolometric luminosity is possible only in the case of the two - temperature - type of the spectrum ( i.e. the warm pseudophotosphere is far below the capability of giving rise to the observed nebular component of radiation ) .",
    "\\(ii ) according to the bipolar ionization structure of the burning wd , the vertical extension of the warm pseudophotosphere is limited by the orbital inclination to get hidden the ionizing source in direction of the observer .",
    "its luminosity can be written as @xmath64 where the surface @xmath65 of the pseudophotosphere is represented by a belt on a sphere with the radius @xmath66 , located around its equator and extended to the latitude @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "@xmath68 is its effective radius ( see eq .  ( 6 ) in paper  i ) .",
    "then the radial extension of such the pseudophotosphere can be expressed as @xmath69 for @xmath70@xmath1  ( table  2 ) and the limiting case @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , we get @xmath73@xmath1 . other possibilities , @xmath74 yield @xmath75@xmath1 .      at day 3.8 after the nova explosion",
    ", @xcite used the kin to find the structure of the circumstellar material around the star .",
    "they determined the angular size of the mid - infrared continuum emitting material to 4.06.2mas , which corresponds to linear size of 6.49.9(d/1.6kpc)au .",
    "as the n - band region is dominated by the nebular emission ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : seds ] ) , which is due to the fast ionized wind from the wd ( see sect .",
    "4.1.1 ) , its maximum extension ( 13au for the velocity of 3000kms@xmath16  and 3.8 days ) is consistent with that detected by the kin .",
    "the measurements obtained by the kin in the inner spatial regime showed evidence of enhanced neutral atomic hydrogen emission and atomic metals located near the wd .",
    "this could reflect the h   zone in the ionization structure inferred from the model sed ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "@xcite measured the near - ir size of rs  oph using the iota and keck interferometer at the same day .",
    "they found a significantly asymmetric emission with the characteristic size of fwhm@xmath76mas .",
    "observations for the following 60 days did not indicate any change , suggesting thus that the ir emission is due to the @xmath77 and @xmath78 transitions in thermal plasma rather than from a hot gas in the expanding shock as considered in current popular models .",
    "also these results  the size and the nature of the ir emission  are consistent with the model sed here .    using the amber / vlt interferometer , @xcite measured the extension of the milliarcsecond - scale emission in the k band continuum , in the br@xmath79 and he2.06@xmath80 m lines at day 5.5 .",
    "observations showed that the emission from all investigated spectral regions is highly flattened with the ratio @xmath81 , having the same position angle and a typical gaussian extension of @xmath82mas for the continuum .",
    "thus , it is possible to conclude that the biconical ionization structure of the circumstellar matter around the wd in rs  oph , as inferred from multiwavelength modelling the sed , is supported by direct interferometric measurements using iota , keck and amber / vlti performed during a few days after the eruption .",
    "the model sed for day 7.3 showed that the shift of the sed maximum from the optical to the far - uv ( or even beyond ) happened during a relatively short time of @xmath83 days ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "a sudden decrease of the optical depth causing the shrinkage of the inflated wd from @xmath84@xmath1  to less than 2.1@xmath1  ( table",
    "2 ) would require removal of a significant amount of dense , optically thick , material in the line of sight .",
    "the corresponding time of such the change should be proportional to the dynamical time scale of the inflated wd , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the density of the matter giving rise to the gravitational force .",
    "so , for the wd mass of @xmath87@xmath88 , its effective radius 160@xmath1  would collapse during @xmath89 days , which is by a factor of @xmath90 larger than the time scale of the observed change in the effective radius . therefore , a gradual shrinking of the wd pseudophotosphere due to the expansion of the outflowing material can not be the cause of its sudden disappearance between day 3.8 and 7.3 .",
    "the sudden change in the sed can be a result of a change in the position of the ionization boundary with respect to the line of sight . if the opening angle of the h   zone @xmath91 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) shrinks so that @xmath92 , the burning wd will rise up the horizon represented by the h / h   boundary .",
    "a shrinkage / enlargement of the @xmath93 angle can be a result of a decreasing mass loss rate from the wd .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the ionization structure of the hot components in symbiotic binaries during outbursts is similar to that sketched in the figure  [ fig : sketch ] here ( see their figs .  1 and 6 ) .",
    "in their model , the opening angle of the h  zone , @xmath94 , is related to the mass loss rate from the wd as @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that a relatively small decrease in the @xmath96 can yield a large increase in the @xmath94 angle ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "during the first days , when the @xmath96 was at a maximum , @xmath97 ( i.e. the hot wd was below the h / h  boundary ) , because we observed the warm pseudophotosphere .",
    "a small decrease in @xmath96 could lead to opening of the h  zone so that @xmath98 , i.e. the burning wd raised up the h / h  horizon and thus we could observe directly its hot @xmath99@xmath1  photosphere at day 7.3 .",
    "this could happen in a short time , because of a relatively low value of @xmath100 .",
    "a transient increase of the _ em _ at day 7.3 supports this view .",
    "multiwavelength modelling the sed revealed that the luminosity of the wd was super - eddington during the whole period of its nuclear burning ( table  2 here and table  2 of the following paper ) .",
    "prior to the emergence of supersoft x - rays , only the lower limit of the wd s luminosity could be determined . during the presence of the two - temperature - type of the spectrum ( i.e. for the first 4 days )",
    ", it was given by the integral of directly measured fluxes ( or their model ) scaled with the distance .",
    "the model sed at day @xmath57 and 3.8 corresponded to the luminosity of 6 and 2@xmath101 , respectively , for @xmath102@xmath88 .",
    "however , its true value was higher , because both the warm shell and the nebula converted only a fraction of the wd radiation into direction of the observer ( sect .",
    "4.1.2 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbol ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .    from day 7.3 , measuring only the short rayleigh - jeans tail of the hot wd radiation , only the lower limit of its temperature and luminosity could be determined ( see appendix  a ) . using the emission measure from the model",
    "sed and the @xmath38 flux from the far - uv spectrum , allowed to determine the minimum temperature of the wd",
    "photosphere , @xmath103k ( eq .  ( [ eq : tmin2 ] ) , table  2 ) and the minimum of its luminosity , @xmath104 ( eq .  ( [ eq : lth ] ) ) , at which the burning wd is just capable of producing the observed _ em _ during day 7.3  19.5 .",
    "note that the luminosity of the nebular component itself corresponds to 1.24@xmath101 at day 7.3 ( table  2 ) .    the emergence of the first supersoft x - rays from the wd at day 26 allowed to determine its luminosity unambiguously to @xmath105@xmath101 ( sect .",
    "such a highly super - eddington luminosity contradicts theoretical predictions , treating the nova event as a simple nuclear bomb explosion .",
    "according to @xcite the luminosity can exceed the eddington limit only at the very beginning of the nova eruption with a rapid decline below it on a time - scale of hours .",
    "however , the opposite cases were reported by some authors already during 70 s and 80 s decades of the last century .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the energy output of the nova fh  ser was well above the eddington limit for about two months after its optical maximum .",
    "the super - eddington state was theoretically investigated by @xcite , who considerred a reduction of the effective opacity due to the rise of a ` porous layer ' above the convective zone of the burning wd ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "these conditions enlarges the eddington luminosity well above its classical value , calculated for the thomson scattering opacity .",
    "the super - eddington state also accelerates a thick continuum driven wind at high rates . the mass loss through the wind at a high rate of a few @xmath106@xmath6  during the hydrogen burning period of rs  oph @xcite is consistent with that suggested for the super - eddington state ( eq .",
    "( 30 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "* for @xmath107 = 20 - 50kms@xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of the bipolar jets for the first 30 days @xcite , which suggests accretion throughout the disk at a high rate , also supports the super - eddington state .",
    "for example , accretion at @xmath108@xmath6   can release its binding energy @xmath109@xmath42 , and thus help to sustain the high luminosity of the accretor for a long time .",
    "finally , it is important to note that the high energy output released during the outburst of rs  oph , as given by the global model sed of this paper , is more than a factor of 10 larger than that so far derived .",
    "this requires a very high accretion rate , which is far above that can be obtained from a spherical wind mass loss of the giant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "considering that the primary source of the material powering the outburst is the wind from the giant , then a different , more efficient mechanism of the mass transfer onto the wd must be in the effect .",
    "this could be realized by the so - called wind roche - lobe overflow ( wrlof ) , which can occur when the wind acceleration zone is stretched out to the roche lobe of the giant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    "the wind of the giant is focused towards the orbital plane and in particular towards the wd .",
    "the accretion rate predicted in the wrlof regime can be 100 times larger than the rate expected from standard bondi - hoyle accretion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "more detailed discussion on the accretion mechanism is presented in the following paper , _",
    "rs  ophiuchi : the supersoft x - ray phase and beyond _ , where other critical parameters are determined from the model seds during the sss phase and following quiescence .",
    "in this paper i applied the method of multiwavelength modelling the sed ( see paper  i ) to the recurrent symbiotic nova rs  oph from its explosion to the sss phase ( to day 26 ) . the model seds revealed the presence of a strong stellar as well as nebular component of radiation in the spectrum .",
    "the contribution from the cool giant was negligible with respect to these components ( sect .  3 , fig .",
