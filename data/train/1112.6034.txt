    "polymer transport is a ubiquitous and fundamental process in biological science and technology .",
    "a good example is polymer translocation in which a polymer ( e.g. , dna or rna ) is driven across a small pore by a chemical or electric potential difference .",
    "individual translocation events can be detected by applying an external force  @xcite , allowing the fundamental properties of polymer transport to be investigated .",
    "in addition , many theoretical investigations have been conducted  @xcite .",
    "statistical results obtained in experiments exhibit a wide distribution in translocation times ( i.e. , the time taken for a polymer to pass through a pore )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations have generated considerable insight  @xcite , which also indicated a broad distribution of the translocation time  @xcite .",
    "currently , the mean translocation time is attracting a lot of interest , particularly its scaling exponents with respect to chain length @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the segment number with size @xmath2 ) and driving force @xmath3 .",
    "however , fluctuations in the translocation time need to be clarified to fully understand the translocation process , but they have received less attention to date .    as is well known , a polymeric chain in equilibrium is a fluctuating coil whose configuration is mathematically described by the trajectory of a random ( or self - avoiding ) walk .",
    "it seems reasonable that when a force is suddenly applied to a portion of the chain , the entire chain will not immediately respond to the stimulus , but only the portion of the chain that is initially set in motion .",
    "the responding domain gradually evolves over time with the propagation of tension along the chain backbone . in domain growth",
    ", the propagation front of the tension follows the disordered trajectory characteristics of a random coil configuration .",
    "the present study investigates the stochastic dynamics of tension propagation , which affects the process time distribution of driven polymer transport .",
    "there are generally two sources of the stochasticity in stochastic processes : noise ( random forces ) and uncertainty in the initial distribution . in the case of polymer transport",
    ", the former source is the brownian force , which is thermal in origin , while the latter source is reflected in the equilibrium configuration when one end of the chain arrives at the pore at time @xmath4 . to quantify the relative importance of these two sources , we consider the time scale involved in polymer transport over a distance @xmath5 by an external force .",
    "two time scales can be identified : the diffusion time @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the diffusion coefficient , which depends on the chain conformation , and the convection time @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mean biased velocity and @xmath10 is the frictional coefficient , which is related to the diffusion coefficient through the einstein relation @xmath11 .",
    "the ratio @xmath12 defines a peclet number . from the condition @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the equilibrium coil size",
    ", the condition for the driven transport regime can be derived as @xmath15 , where the effects of thermal fluctuations become relatively unimportant . for stronger forces @xmath16 , the brownian force can be neglected even when considering the transport of a single segment . on the other hand , there is inevitably an uncertainty in the initial distribution , irrespective of the driving force .",
    "this uncertainty is expected to be a major cause of the wide translocation time distributions observed in experiments .",
    "below , we neglect minor effects associated with the stochasticity due to the brownian force .",
    "we consider the transport time distribution due to stochastic tension propagation along a random backbone trajectory for two cases : driven translocation across a pore for which the external force is spatially fixed and stretching by suddenly pulling one chain end , for which the forcing point is fixed .",
    "the stochastic scenario allows higher cumulants ( e.g. , the standard deviation and skewness ) to be discussed in addition to the average of the process time distribution .",

    "the propagation front of the tension is located at @xmath17 .",
    "the top and bottom snapshots depict stochastic evolution along the initial disordered configuration during time interval @xmath18 . ]",
    "we first consider driven translocation . to analyze the nonequilibrium response",
    ", we adopt the two - phase picture  @xcite in which the chain separates on the _ cis _ side into quiescent and moving domains . as illustrated in fig .  1 , the coordinate @xmath19 is taken to be perpendicular to the wall with the pore .",
    "the driving force acts only at the pore site ( @xmath20 ) with a constant force magnitude @xmath3 in the @xmath19-direction from the _ cis _ to the _ trans _ side .",
    "the linear polymer consisting of @xmath1 segments is initially in @xmath21 .",
    "the polymer segments are numbered from one end of the chain to the other end ( @xmath1th segment ) ; the first segment arrives at the pore at time @xmath4 . as time evolves ,",
    "the rear segments are gradually sucked and the moving domain on the _ cis _ side grows in the negative @xmath19-region . at time @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the number of the segment at the pore ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath24 is the segment number at the tension - propagation front ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the propagation front follows a random path sampled from equilibrium coil configurations .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of a particular sample strongly depends on how the polymer is brought to the pore .",
    "below , the length , force , and time are made dimensionless by employing units of the segment length @xmath2 , force @xmath25 , and time @xmath26 , respectively ( where @xmath27 is the thermal energy and @xmath28 is the solvent viscosity ) .    here , we introduce the relevant exponents . the flory exponent @xmath29 and the dynamical exponent @xmath30",
    "are associated with the static and dynamic properties , respectively ; the equilibrium coil size is described by @xmath31 and the hydrodynamic drag force acting on the coil with moving velocity @xmath32 is described by @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the exponents have the following values in practical important cases : @xmath34 ( for an ideal chain ) , @xmath35 ( for a three - dimensional self - avoiding chain ) , @xmath36 ( for non - draining case ) , and @xmath37 ( for free - draining case ) .",

    "the reason for the present choice lies in the fact that it is consistent with the iso - flux condition required for the moving domain in the translocation process  @xcite , while the previous one is not ( see appendix a ) .",
    "equation  ( [ time_evol_translocation ] ) can be arranged into a stochastic differential equation that expresses the stochastic evolution of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the noise originating from the initial random configuration .",

    "there are two distinct stages in the driven translocation process : tension propagation and post - propagation .",

    "an equilibrium coil in free space retains a symmetric configuration . however , this is not the case for the initial configuration of a translocating polymer when a wall excludes the polymer , one end of which is located at the pore . to clarify this point",

    "@xcite , the translocation time depends on the initial configuration , it is reasonable to assume that stochastic evolution of the tension propagation along the initial asymmetric configuration gives rise to the left - skewed profiles observed in numerical and experimental studies .",
    "conversely , the detection of other translocation time profiles ( e.g. , right - skewed and symmetric profiles  @xcite ) may be regarded as a good indicator that other factors ( such as specific interactions in the pore ) dominate the process .",
    "figures  5(a ) and ( b ) show plots of the normalized standard deviation ( nsd ) @xmath126 .",

    "one can indeed check @xmath156 using the first moment relation @xmath157 ( eq .  ( [ translocation_1body_dist ] ) ) .",
    "second , this causes the qualitative difference in the stochastic effect in two processes . in the stretching dynamics , the evolution of the moving domain has two components ( fig .  6 , the right equation in eq .",

    "one component is the pulled out part in the region @xmath158 and the other component is the rear part ( @xmath159 ) due to the tension spreading .",
    "the former dominates the process ( @xmath160 ) giving rise to the deterministic term in the stochastic differential equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ dt_eq_pull ] ) and ( [ pull_a ] ) ) , while the latter acts as a small noise term ( eqs .",
    "( [ dt_eq_pull ] ) and ( [ pull_b ] ) ) .",
    "in contrast , in the translocation dynamics , the moving domain has only a stochastic component @xmath161 ( fig .  1 , the left equation in eq .  ( [ extension_cmp ] ) ) , which results in the non - vanishing nsd , even in the long - chain limit .",
    "before concluding , let us make some comments concerning the relation between the present study and other theoretical studies of polymer translocation .",
    "first , we have focused on the  driven regime \" ( i.e. , @xmath162 ) for which the chain deformation dynamics are important alongside tension propagation . in particular , as noted in sec .",
    "ii , we expect that our approach can accurately calculate the process time distribution in the strong force regime @xmath163 . in such situations , the retardation effect due to segment accumulation on the _ trans _ side provides only a weak perturbation so that it can be neglected for asymptotic scaling . however , it is essential to appropriately treat the _",
    "trans _ side to describe the translocation process in the weak - force  near - equilibrium \" regime @xmath164 , as has been done in several studies  @xcite . in this regime , the brownian force also greatly influences the process time distribution .",
    "it is interesting to determine the scaling structure of the standard deviation in such a weak - force regime .",
    "second , the pore has been assumed to be only geometric constrictions .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to this simplest situation to get a clear - cut impact of the initial polymer configuration on the process time distribution . however , elucidating the case with functionalized pores with friction , confinement or specific interactions with polymers is an important problem .    to summarize , we have discussed the process time distribution for driven polymer transport inherent in a flexible molecular chain .",
    "the tension propagates with time along random paths following the initial configuration and the stochastic propagation mechanism is introduced as the distribution origin .",
    "we give the formulation for the two cases of translocation and stretching , which involve different forcing points .",
    "the forcing point of the former process is fixed in the rest frame , whereas that of the latter process is fixed to the chain end .",
    "our analysis predicts the scaling exponents of the first and second cumulants ( mean , variance ) in the process time . in translocation dynamics",
    ", the probability distribution of the process time has a characteristic asymmetric shape , which may reflect the initial shapes , and fluctuation effects remain substantial even in the long - chain limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the broadness of the distribution in stretching dynamics becomes unnoticeable in the long - chain limit .",
    "this work was supported in part by the jsps core - to - core program  international research network for non - equilibrium dynamics of soft matter \" .",
    "the authors are also grateful to an anonymous referee for his / her helpful comments on the relevance of the iso - flux condition to the translocation process .",
    "recently , rowghanian and grosberg pointed out a unique property inherent to the moving domain in the translocation process , that is to say , the segment flux is almost constant everywhere in the moving domain  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the balance of the fluxes into and out of the moving domain , i.e. , @xmath165 , where @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
