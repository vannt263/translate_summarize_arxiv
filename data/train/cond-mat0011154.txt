    "the proximity of sc and af phases , together with other experimental evidences , suggested a possible role of spin fluctuations in the superconductivity mechanism,@xcite and prompted intensive theoretical investigation on the sc / af borderline .",
    "@xcite since the early suggestion by kino and fukuyama,@xcite mean - field ( mf ) approaches have often been adopted to investigate the sc / af interface.@xcite several previous mf treatments considered low - symmetry structures,@xcite namely @xmath0-()@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 , with four inequivalent molecules in the unit cell .",
    "the resulting numerical calculation is complex and computationally very demanding , so that only fairly small lattices have been considered , leading to large intrinsic uncertainties on the estimated properties , particularly at the phase transition . on the other hand , in the orthorhombic centrosymmetric @xmath0-phase crystals of the et - y family all molecules in the layer are equivalent.@xcite the greater symmetry with respect to @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 apparently does not lead to significant differences in the physical behavior , notably in the sc properties .",
    "indeed , et - br is a superconductor at ambient pressure , and et - cl under moderate pressure presents the highest @xmath5 observed in salts.@xcite the mf approach has been applied @xcite also to these more symmetric lattices to study the coexistence of charge ordering instabilities .",
    "including the order parameters relevant to charge instabilities further increases the complexity of the calculation and leads to large uncertainties in the transition region , as recognized by the authors of ref . .",
    "we instead propose to fully exploit the higher symmetry of the centrosymmetric et - y structures to build a _",
    "symmetrized _ mf approach for the superconducting metallic / magnetically ordered phase transition.@xcite by exploiting symmetry we are able to work on lattices as large as @xmath210@xmath3 sites , and to explore a wide region of the parameter space , keeping numerical procedures and finite - size effects under control .",
    "moreover and most importantly , we get a simple and complete description of the electronic bands of these system , focusing only on those effects which are directly connected with the interesting physics .",
    "the mf treatment maps the problem of interacting electrons into an effective non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "the comparison between reliable mf results and available experimental data then allows us to safely define the intrinsic limitations of effective one - electron pictures in describing the physics of @xmath0-phase salts .",
    "recently more refined approaches have been applied to @xmath0-phase salts .",
    "for instance , fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) @xcite or third - order perturbation ( pt ) approach @xcite have been applied to investigate the fluctuation mechanism for superconductivity and to estimate the critical temperature .",
    "however these approaches are only valid in the weak electronic correlations regime , and have been applied to a simplified model for the @xmath0-phase layer , the so - called dimer model.@xcite the same model has also been adopted in the framework of the dynamical mf@xcite and within a renormalization group approach,@xcite which offer complementary information with respect to ordinary mf techniques . as we shall discuss in the following , the reliability of the dimer model can not be taken for granted in the whole parameter space . here",
    "we show that by exploting the high symmetry of the et - y salts family one can get a picture of the @xmath0-phase layer that is computationally and theoretically as simple as the dimer model , without introducing any approximation .",
    "in this paper we model the system in terms of a simple hubbard , @xmath6 , hamiltonian , but the proposed procedure can be easily extended to @xmath7 or @xmath8   hamiltonians , to investigate charge - ordering transitions , whose possible coexistence with spin - order has been recently suggested.@xcite moreover , the symmetry properties can be conveniently implemented in more refined calculation schemes , to get simpler and more reliable description of the physics of @xmath0-phase salts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to the description of the method .",
    "we then analyze the magnetic instabilities of et - y salts , and discuss the effects of the instabilities on the band structure . the difference between our symmetrized mf and the other mf approaches",
    "is stressed , and the reliability of the dimer model is shortly addressed . finally , we make connection with the experiment by discussing the pressure dependence of the sc / af interface in the et - cl , and by making a comparison with ambient pressure et - br superconductor .",
    "consistently with experimental data on centrosymmetric @xmath0-phase salts,@xcite we consider a unit cell with 4 equivalent molecular sites , and do not allow for modification of the periodicity of the crystal structure at the magnetic phase transition .",
    "we adopt the @xmath6 hubbard hamiltonian to describe coulomb interactions giving rise to magnetic ordering :    @xmath9    where the indices run on the bedt - ttf sites , the first term accounts for the intersite hopping , and the other terms describe the on - site coulomb repulsion . in eq.([ht ] ) , @xmath10 is the usual site number operator @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the net magnetization operator .    in the mf approximation",
    "the many - body interaction is described by an effective single particle interaction , where each particle feels the other particles as a source of a mf potential .",
    "then each product of two electronic operators @xmath13 is approximated with an expression where only a single operator appears , the effect of the second operator being substituted by its ground - state expectation value .",

    "the off - diagonal part of each one of these hamiltonians is exactly the same as in the original tight - binding model , but the mf treatment of on - site electron - electron interaction introduces a diagonal contribution . specifically , the diagonal elements of @xmath40 within each unit cell are : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "the fermi level is fixed by the conservation of the total number of electrons , leading to unbalanced up and down spin population .",

    "however , the different behavior of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the right panel of fig .  [ eta ] deserves some comments .",
    "based on the two standard stability conditions : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 representing the expectation value of the working hamiltonian , it is easy to prove that stable states for our system correspond to points with positive slope in the @xmath64 curves.@xcite the negative slope region in the @xmath65 curve ( marked by a dotted line in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ eta ] ) then corresponds to unstable states , i.e. states that can not be reached by our physical system .",
    "thus the ferromagnetic instability corresponds to a first order phase transition , characterized by a discontinuous jump of the order parameter at the transition , located at @xmath66 ev .",
    "the small region around @xmath55 where the @xmath65 is non - single - valued corresponds to the hysteresis region , where two stable states coexist .",
    "the behavior of @xmath56 is different , with @xmath67 having infinite slope at @xmath68 ev .",

    "extracting @xmath55 from the slope of the @xmath74 vs @xmath73 curve is a much safer procedure than searching for the minimum @xmath44 where finite @xmath74 appears .",
    "the calculated @xmath74 values are affected by finite uncertainties , with a minimum intrinsic uncertainty given by the inverse of the number of unit cells .",
    "since @xmath74 enters the hamiltonian matrix as a multiplicative factor for @xmath44 , the uncertainty in @xmath74 implies an uncertainty in @xmath44 , with @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , at small @xmath74 the relative uncertainty on @xmath44 can be very large .",
    "this is by no means accidental , but reflects the intrinsic limitation of investigating phase transitions through finite size calculations . at the transition in fact the correlation length of the fluctuations in the order parameters",

    "an interesting observation is that the conduction gap ( lower panel ) closes not at the very beginning of the transition , but only when the transition comes to completeness .",
    "this corresponds to the appearance of a region of stability for a phase with simultaneously af distortion and residual metallic behavior . in other words ,",
    "when the transition is continuous , our data suggest the presence of an antiferromagnetic metal phase , similar to that discussed at length in refs .  . however , the extent of this phase is very narrow , so that it represents at most a transient phase .",
    "searching for some evidence of discontinuous phase transition , we have also `` released the pressure '' , by extrapolating the @xmath54 s estimates at @xmath79 = 3 and 27 kbar down to a nominal pressure of @xmath8233 kbar .",
    "surprisingly , the transition is continuous again , and smoother than at ambient @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , we find no clear evidence for discontinuous transitions , except possibly in a very narrow region in the parameter space corresponding to et - cl at @xmath79 = 3 kbar . in general , the observation of very narrow regions of discontinuity and/or af - metallic coexistence is strongly affected by numerical uncertainties and/or finite - size effects.@xcite these transient states , being intrinsically unstable , can not be associated with physically significant states .",

    "@xmath55 relies on searching for the minimum @xmath44 where finite @xmath56 appears . as discussed above , this procedure leads to large uncertainties in @xmath55 , that have to be properly accounted for in the analysis of numerical results .",

    "this small value for the order parameter implies a minimum uncertainty in @xmath85 of @xmath60 0.02 ev .",
    "then the two transition points observed by kino and fukuyama , @xmath87 = 0.762 ev and @xmath85 = 0.758 ev , coincide within numerical accuracy . in the lack of additional information",
    "their data are consistent with a single transition , as we find for the @xmath54 s relevant to et - cl at @xmath77 = 127 k or at @xmath79 = 3 kbar ( fig .  [ etagap ] ) the presence of an antiferromagnetic metallic phase is then questionable .",
    "similar problems occur in the interpretation of data in ref . .",
    "here a two - transition scenario is proposed at low @xmath79 , involving a continuous transition from a paramagnetic metal to an antiferromagnetic metal ( finite @xmath21 and negative @xmath76 ) , immediately followed by a first order transition to an insulating state .",
    "this complex scenario , that we were unable to reproduce in our large lattice for any choice of the parameter set , is probably either a finite - size effect or a numerical artifact .",
    "one must also keep in mind the possibility it represents a characteristic feature of @xmath0()@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 , due to its lower symmetry .",
    "however , since it does not appear in the more symmetric et - cl phase at any pressure , it is irrelevant as far as sc is concerned .    in ref . the numerical uncertainty in @xmath88 , fixed by the authors at 0.001 , propagates to give @xmath89 0.0014",

    "the estimate for @xmath90 , i.e. the critical @xmath44 for the appearance of af order , obtained for @xmath91 , is affected by a large uncertainty : @xmath92 .",

    "the proposed estimate of the critical @xmath44 for the opening of the semiconducting gap , @xmath95 is different from @xmath55 , again suggesting the presence of an intermediate phase with both metallic and af character .",
    "quite in agreement with our results at large @xmath79 , the metallic antiferromagnetic phase is a marginal phase that only survives in a very narrow transient regime . indeed , as pointed out in ref .",
    "( section 3.4.5 ) , such a phase would imply a weak af order and reconstruction of the fermi surface , which however have not been experimentally observed .",
    "our approach thus proves useful in excluding on a purely theoretical basis the spurious complexities in the phase diagram due to finite - size effects and/or numerical uncertainties , and should be particularly convenient when extended to describe charge ordering instabilities together with magnetic instabilities .",
    "several papers discuss @xmath0-phase bedt - ttf salts within the the dimer approximation.@xcite basically , the tight - binding hamiltonian for the four frontier molecular orbitals in the unit cell is rewritten in terms of the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the @xmath96-dimers . since @xmath96 is at least twice as large as the other hopping integrals",

    ". for the parameters relevant to @xmath99-phase salts , the bands calculated within the dimer model compare favorably with those obtained in the four - band calculation , confirming the validity of the dimer model approximation at least for the non - interacting case.@xcite the dimer - model lattice is simple , but still shows interesting physics .",
    "in fact , by varying the @xmath100 ratio , it interpolates between a square lattice and a collection of 1d chains.@xcite whereas it is suggestive to relate the variegated behavior obtained from such a model to the variety of observed properties for @xmath0-phase salts , some caution is in order . just as an example , consider the case @xmath101 , where the dimer lattice reduces to a half - filled square lattice with perfect nesting . as it is well - known , the critical @xmath44 for the antiferromagnetic instability goes to zero in this limit , as also confirmed by mf calculations.@xcite instead , a mf calculation for the same parameters as in fig . 3 , but @xmath102 , yields a continuous transition to the af phase with a finite and fairly large @xmath103 ev .",
    "this qualitatively different behavior can be easily rationalized : the small interactions between bonding and antibonding orbitals are large enough to break the commensurability of the simple dimer model at @xmath102.@xcite a word of caution is also necessary when introducing electron correlations in the dimer model .",
    "indeed , starting from a hubbard hamiltonian for the four - molecules layer , the resulting effective @xmath104 for the dimer model is related to both @xmath44 and @xmath96 , according to a relation first proposed in ref .   and rediscussed and extended in ref .  .",

    "we now relate our results to the experimental observations relevant to the et - y family .",
    "as mentioned above , several evidences indicates that the et - y salts are just at the af / sc borderline . at ambient pressure",
    "the et - cl salt is a mott antiferromagnet , with a magnetic moment amplitude of 0.45 @xmath107 , @xcite that compares favorably with the present and previous @xcite estimates of the magnetic order parameter . by applying pressure above 300 bar",

    "however , this compound is the least investigated in the et - y family , and we shall not consider it here .",
    "rather obviously , a mf approach is inadequate to describe phenomena related to non - equilibrium states , disorder and/or sample inhomogeneity , like cooling rate effects and reentrant superconductivity .",
    "we therefore focus here on the complete - sc / af crossover affected by pressure and/or by isotopic substitution .",

    "a similar effect of reduced pressure can be associated to deuteration , which corresponds to smaller end - group excursions around their equilibrium values . from the values of the corresponding @xmath5 s , we can empirically associate an increase in @xmath79 of @xmath60 380 bar for the cl - br substitution , and a decrease of @xmath60 140 bar for deuteration .",

    "[ alphabeta ] with the measured areas from shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) experiments performed at several pressures in the 2 - 10 kbar range at the liquid helium temperature.@xcite in order to renormalize the effects associated to the global volume contraction due to the different temperatures of the sdh and structural data , the @xmath118 ratio has been reported as a function of pressure .",
    "in fact , the @xmath117 area is equal to the area of the brillouin zone for the 3/4-filled system .",
    "the 3 kbar @xmath118 nicely fits the experiment , and a straight line through the experimental points extrapolates near to the calculated 28 kbar point .",
    "we notice that the crystallographic axes ratio @xmath119 is practically unchanged with pressure.@xcite this observation sheds doubts on the possibility of adopting @xmath119 as a rough estimate of @xmath118 , as suggested by ref .  .",
    "table [ tabella ] , rightmost column , reports the et - cl @xmath55 values calculated by our mf approach .",
    "a word of warning is necessary when comparing data obtained at different temperatures , since it has been observed@xcite that the values of the hopping parameters change correspondingly .",
    "however , this effect is not very pronounced in et - y family,@xcite and we shall neglect it in the following .",
    "we notice that @xmath55 increases monotonously with @xmath79 , thus accounting for the pressure driven superconductivity transition in terms of an increase of the critical value needed to reach the af phase . in this respect",
    ", @xmath55 seems to be a good `` indicator '' of the effective pressure of fig .",
    "other previously suggested indicators , like the @xmath120 ratio,@xcite or the @xmath119 ratio,@xcite seem to work less satisfactorily in this case : @xmath120 does not increase monotonously with @xmath79 ( table [ tabella ] ) , and , as noted above , @xmath119 is practically constant .",
    "we now turn attention to et - br . when comparing the ambient pressure , 127 k hopping integrals of et - cl with the corresponding ones of et - br , one finds small differences , and we get for the two systems virtually identical phase transitions , occurring at basically the same @xmath55 ( table [ tabella ] ) .",
    "therefore , the different ground state of et - cl ( af ) and et - br ( sc ) at ambient pressure can not be understood in terms of a difference in @xmath55 .",
    "one might think that the actual effective @xmath44 is different in the two types of salts , being smaller in et - br due a larger screening of the intersite coulomb potential from the more polarizable br anions .",
    "however , this kind of qualitative explanation is not corroborated by the numerical values of the anion polarizabilities obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations,@xcite and is difficult to reconcile with the observation of an af state for @xmath108-et - br at ambient pressure .",
    "we could not calculate the hopping integrals in this case , as the atomic coordinates are not available in the literature .",
    "we have used the @xmath54 s calculated in ref .   for both et - br and @xmath108-et - br at 127 k ( properly rescaled since the method of calulation is different from ours ) .",
    "we do not find significant difference between the @xmath55 s of the two compounds .",
    "as we already pointed out , @xmath119 or @xmath120 are not good indicators of the properties of @xmath0-phase salts , and can not be chosen as the @xmath121-axis parameter in a @xmath122 phase diagram like that reported in fig .",
    "both the ratio of @xmath116 and @xmath117 orbits and @xmath55 work satisfactorily as far as the @xmath79-dependence of et - cl properties is concerned .",
    "however , both fail if applied to rationalize the different behavior of et - cl and et - br and/or the effects due to deuteration .",
    "it is important to underline that both @xmath118 and @xmath55 are `` single particle '' parameters , in the sense that they are fully determined by the band structure , i.e. , the @xmath54 s values .",
    "investigating the band structure of @xmath0-phase salts offers useful information to rationalize their behavior , but this information is not enough , and the role of interactions beyond single - particle picture has to be invoked to understand the behavior of systems near the af / sc interface . the failure of simple band - structure treatments for @xmath0-phase salts has been recently suggested based on the @xmath79-dependence of cyclotron effective masses with pressure,@xcite and can also be recognized from high resolution mesurements of thermal expansion coefficients.@xcite residual electronic correlations , disorder induced localization effects , electron - phonon coupling and interlayer effects all can play an important role , particularly at the af / sc interface .",
    "more theoretical and experimental work is in order to settle the relative importance of these effects .",
