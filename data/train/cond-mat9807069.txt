    "the same , even earlier , happened to manganite perovskites la@xmath1a@xmath2mno@xmath5 where a = ca , ba , sr , pb .",
    "nevertheless , some studies in this field continued through the 80 s . in 1993 , in connection with new thin - film technology for manganite perovskites @xcite the interest in these , called today colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) , compounds has been revived . as a result , approaches and concepts developed and applied during 70 s and 80 s has again been brought into the focus of attention .",
    "partial list includes : magnetic polaron versus fm - afm phase separation , ferromagnetism in narrow conduction band , non - pole structure of green function in s - d and hubbard models .",
    "this concerns also the concept of localization driven by magnetic fluctuations    we published 10 years ago a series of papers on the resistivity peak and magnetoresistive effect in magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the present authors were the first to apply the concept of mobility edge for disorder determined by spin fluctuation .",
    "the concept of localization driven by magnetic fluctuations has become actual again , when the problem of resistivity peak and colossal magnetoresistance has again been brought into a focus of attention .",
    "below we reproduce our paper `` anderson localization in ferromagnetic semiconductors due to spin disorder .",
    "i. narrow conduction band '' @xcite , the first one from this series .",
    "magnetic semiconductors form a wide class of materials with\u0018 unique physical properties , strong temperature dependence of the electroresistivity being one of them @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was most thoroughly studied experimentally in cubic ferromagnetics , such as cdcr@xmath3se@xmath4 , euo and eus .",
    "all these materials , when being deficient of chalcogen ( oxygen ) have n - type conductivity .",
    "the deficit being strong enough , at low temperatures these materials have temperature - independent metallic conductivity or conductivity with small activation energy ( a few mev ) ; when the temperature @xmath6 approaches the curie temperature @xmath7 electroresistivity rises sharply .",
    "the rise can amount to four orders of magnitude in cdcr@xmath3se@xmath4,@xcite six orders in eus@xmath1 @xcite , and even twelve orders in euo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the same behavior of the resistivity can be seen in eu@xmath1la@xmath8s @xcite , eu@xmath1gd@xmath8o @xcite and eu@xmath1gd@xmath8o@xmath0 @xcite . in the paramagnetic region",
    "there are two types of behavior : in cdcr@xmath3se@xmath4 and euo@xmath1 ( x<.4%)the resistivity has large activation energy ( @xmath9 ev and @xmath10 ev respectively ) in the whole temperature range . at the same time the resistivity of eus@xmath1 and of euo and eus being doped by a three - valent rare earth metal ( and also of eu@xmath1gd@xmath8se , which at @xmath11 is ferromagnetic @xcite ) returns at hight temperatures to the initial quasi - metallic behavior .",
    "the common feature of all these materials is a strong interaction between electrons and spins of the magnetic d- and f - ions .",
    "it is commonly accepted now that the electrical of these materials are determined by the interaction of electrons with the magnetic subsystem .",
    "pre - existing explanations of the above - mentioned resistivity behavior used the following two approaches :    \\1 .",
    "magnetopolaronic approach ( in various modifications ) , which was used for the description of metal - insulator transition in euo@xmath1 ;    \\2 .",
    "concentrational approach , when it was supposed that the resistivity rise is due to the movement of the conductivity band edge with the temperature relative to the fixed impurity levels .",
    "we describe the conductivity behavior in all above - mentioned materials in a novel approach , which is based upon the ideas and methods of localization theory .",
    "the differences in the resistivity behavior between materials , as it will be shown later , are due to the different relations of the band width to the spin exchange splitting and also to the different electron - impurity interactions .",
    "hamiltonian of the electron is @xmath12 where v(l - l ) is the hopping integral , i is the s - d(f ) exchange integral , @xmath13 is spin localized on @xmath14 site , @xmath15 are electron creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath16 is the potential of electron - impurity interaction .",
    "( we suppose that magnetic and crystallographic lattices coincide and that there is one electron orbit per site ) .",
    "it is convenient to separate out two limiting cases @xcite    \\1 .",
    "narrow conduction band @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the band width ;    \\2 . wide conduction band @xmath19 .",
    "as it was shown in band calculations , the conduction band in cdcr@xmath3se@xmath4 , formed by p - d@xmath20 orbitals ( 3d@xmath20 cr + 4p se ) is narrow @xcite , and p - d@xmath21 conduction bands in eux are wide @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting however , that strong inequalities for these materials do not hold .    in part",

    "when @xmath37 the angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 and hence the hamiltonian @xmath40 are the functions of time .",
    "luckily for us there is a small parameter ratio of typical fluctuations frequency to electron energy @xmath41 .",
    "then the adiabatic approximation is applicable , and what we need to solve is static problem with the random hamiltonian @xmath42 .",
    "hence we obtain the disordered system with an off - diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "we suppose also that the influence of the electron - impurity interaction on the conduction electrons is much less than the influence of magnetic disorder , and completely neglect the former .",

    "it was supposed that the electric current is carried by the electrons activated from fixed impurity levels , created by @xmath47 to the red - shifted band edge .",

    "also a similar resistivity transition takes place in n - cdcr@xmath3s@xmath4 @xcite , where the band - edge shift is blue at all temperatures @xcite .",
    "what is more important , according to modern conceptions for conductivity in disordered systems , it is the mobility edge @xmath52 which is important .",
    "we remind that the mobility edge is the energy which separates the localized from the extended states . for the calculation of the resistivity it is possible to use eq .",

    "@xcite we shall consider @xmath44 as temperature independent .",
    "than our main task is to calculate @xmath52 .",
    "let us turn to hamiltonian ( [ hamef ] ) .",
    "as is well known , the problem of the mobility edge calculation is equivalent to the calculation of the convergence radius for a non - averaged green function self - energy perturbation series expansion .",

    "corresponds the factor @xmath61 and the passage of every intermediate site produces multiplication by the factor @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite    it is worth noting that the analysis of the series ( [ self ] ) is much easier than that of the series involved in the case of the traditional andersen model with diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "it is due to the fact that the expectation value of every term in eq.([self ] ) is finite and , hence , the convergence of this series with probability one is equivalent to its convergence in some norm .",
    "indeed we can use the theorem according to which the series of independent random variables , say @xmath63 , converges with probability one if and only if the series @xmath64 and @xmath65 converge , where the brackets mean the average @xcite ( in our case over the distribution @xmath42 , that is due to the ergodic hypothesis the average over all spin configurations ) .",
    "let us analyze now the averaged series .",
    "we introduce formally a small parameter @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of nearest neighbors , and then calculate the averages in the leading approximation with respect @xmath66 .",
    "since the ratio of the number of intersections to the total number of sites for a typical path is of the order of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , we shall on averaging neglect the intersections at all , _",
    "i.e. _ , when calculating @xmath70 we consider all the sites involved as different ones , though the number of paths of of the given length @xmath58 being approximated by @xmath71 note that our analysis deviates from the traditional one for the case of the off - diagonal disorder ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . neglecting the correlations due to self - intersections of the paths we",
    ", however , take into account the correlations created by magnetic short - range order , which is more important in the problem .",
    "we are interested in the convergence radius of the series @xmath72 where the following notation is introduced : @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the probability density of a given spin configuration and the brackets @xmath75 denote the average over all paths of a given length .",
    "it is worth noting that in our approximation the convergence of the series @xmath76 is equivalent to the convergence of @xmath77 .",
    "let us consider two limiting cases :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath78    in this case the effective hopping integral does not fluctuate and the series take the form @xmath79 and its convergence radius @xmath80 naturally coincides with the exact band edge ( the center of the band corresponds to @xmath81 ) .",
    "\\2 . @xmath82 .    in this case",
    "all the paths of a given length are identical , all the spin configurations equally participate and averaging is easy to make up @xmath83 this can be rewritten in the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an operator with the kernel @xmath86",
    ". then the convergence of the series ( [ ser ] ) is equivalent to the convergence of @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the largest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath85 .",
    "thus for the mobility edge we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the pair probability and @xmath91 is the one - site probability . in this approximation",
    "all the paths are again identical and we again obtain eq.([modedge ] ) , only now @xmath88 is the largest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath85 with the kernel @xmath92^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] due to the variational principle @xmath88 is the maximal value of the functional @xmath93 for the estimation of @xmath88 we may use the trial function in the same form as in the molecular field approximation . in this approximation @xmath94 and the operator",
    "@xmath85 is again factorizable .",
    "the eigenfunction of @xmath85 corresponding to the larger of the two eigenvalues has the form @xmath95^{1/2}\\cos(\\theta/2).\\ ] ] using this trial function in the variational principle we obtain @xmath96 hence the result is the mobility edge expressed in terms of magnetization and pair correlation function of the nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "our method of mobility edge evaluation can be generalized also to the case of arbitrary relation between @xmath97 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "for arbitrary temperature the calculation of the mobility edge is equivalent to solving the cumbersome integral equation . for @xmath98 , however , this equation can be easily solved ; the mobility edge then is @xmath99 comparison with experiment --------------------------    though eq.([edge ] ) is obtained for classical spins we ll use it to explain the temperature dependence of the resistivity of cdcr@xmath3se@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity at low temperatures ( @xmath100 k ) shows that the chemical potential lies in the close vicinity of the band edge . at those temperatures",
    "the resistivity is defined by the exact position of @xmath101 relative to the band edge ; at higher temperatures when @xmath52 moves upward , the dependence of @xmath102 on @xmath6 is determined mainly by the shift of @xmath52 and for the chemical potential we may use the approximation @xmath103 . inserting into eq .",

    "we can deduce that eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) can claim for a quantitative description of the experimental dependence .",
    "this formula also explains the colossal negative magnetoresistance of the materials under consideration , as the magnetic field strongly influences the spin correlators in the exponent , especially near @xmath7 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the data for high resistivity samples of cdcr@xmath3se@xmath4 was presented . in this case the resistivity as the function of temperature has no maximum , but the dependence of @xmath113 on @xmath114 changes its slope after the transition to the paramagnetic region .",
    "such a behavior is also described by eqs .",
    "( [ rhodelta ] ) and ( [ edge ] ) with the chemical potential @xmath115 .",
    "it is expedient to discuss the applicability of the approach of this ancestor paper to new classes of materials and its place among more recent theoretical approaches .",
    "our principal point was that strongly interacting system of electrons and magnetic ions ( s - d exchange model ) in classical approximation for the ions spins and narrow electron band , reduces to a random - bond model with off - diagonal disorder depending on an instant spin configuration .",
    "this double - exchange ( de ) hamiltonian ( eq . ( [ hamef ] ) in the present manuscript ) has been reopened quite recently @xcite .    the model , we believe , can be applied with minimal changes to manganite pyrochlores discovered recently @xcite .",
    "its application to high- carrier concentration cmr compounds such as manganite perovskites demands discussions and probably additional ideas .",
    "formally , in this approximation the difference between , say , lasrmno@xmath116 and cdcr@xmath117se@xmath118 ( except for carriers concentration ) is that in the latter the doping electrons appear ( due to se vacancies ) in the empty d - band , whereas in the former the doping holes appear in the filled d - band ( due to capture of d - electrons by sr atoms ) . according to our concept ,",
    "it is the movement of mobility edge , with temperature and magnetic field , relative to the fermi level that explains the resistivity peak and cmr effect .",
    "it is concordant with the recent conclusion of varma @xcite who suggested the decisive role of the above spin - dependent disorder in metal - semiconductor transition and cmr effect in manganite perovskites .    the viewpoint that spin disorder alone can not localize carriers at temperatures close to @xmath119 and in paramagnetic state has been argued by millis et al .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a perturbational calculation .",
    "later this group presented very subtle arguments concerning probability distribution of spin - dependent hopping integral @xcite in favor of their conclusion .",
    "the matter is that , as with every random - bond model , de hamiltonian keeps a large portion of the states at the band center delocalized irrespective of how the bond fluctuations are strong .",
    "therefore , it may turn out that the weight of the localized states be insufficient to embed large number of holes ( 0.2 to 0.3 per cell ) .",
    "after numerical simulation with the use of one - parameter scaling localization theory @xcite it has been found that this is really the case for pure de mechanism .",
    "note that for sc lattice our result of 1988 @xmath120 ( see manuscript above ) is in a reasonable agreement with the new more exact @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "thus , an agreement with experiment for manganites may be achieved by introducing some additional mechanism .",
    "millis et al .",
    "@xcite developed and advocated jahn - teller polaron mechanism to explain the resistivity peak and cmr . on the other hand , in 1988 we proposed the mechanism based on the pinning of the fermi energy by the donor levels , due to very weak overlap of the vacancy states with magnetic d - states in cdcr@xmath117se@xmath118(see present paper ) .",
    "recently our mechanism has been recognized @xcite , and applied to labamno@xmath116 by bebenin et al.@xcite . in the case of manganite perovskites",
    "one may speculate that the fermi level is more or less fixed by impurity band formed by sr , ba , etc .",
    "acceptor states .",
    "the band emerges in mn d - band at low temperatures and holes are mobile because the d - band is delocalized . with increasing the temperature",
    "the mobility edge shifts towards higher energies and holes remain in localized part of the band .",
    "recently an approximate pinning of the fermi level has been found in a model where diagonal disorder is added to de hopping hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "numerical simulation using one - parameter scaling localization theory have shown that the states at the fermi energy are localized in pm region if the intensity of diagonal disorder is as intense as about the bandwidth @xcite .",
    "though this model is very attractive , the physical origin of such strong fluctuation of mn d - levels is not evident .",
    "sheng et al .",
    "@xcite attribute it to potential fluctuations due to random substitution of la by sr , ca etc . using experimental data on resistivity of polycrystalline samples .",
    "however , contrary to the assumption of @xcite there exist single crystals with zero - temperature resistivity smaller than @xmath122 which do exhibit large resistivity peak @xcite .",
    "this is an evidence in favor of weak substitutional disorder , and impurity band formation .",
