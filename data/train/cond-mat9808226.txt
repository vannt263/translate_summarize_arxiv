    "@xmath3 transition metal mono - nitrides ( tmn ) are interesting technologically due to a rich variety of properties , ranging from high - t@xmath4 superconductivity ( observed in tin and vn ) , to very hard surface coatings , to heterogeneous catalysis@xcite .",
    "although some characteristics are common to the whole series of compounds such as having high melting points and chemical hardnesses , this class also exhibits interesting variation in some properties .",
    "scn is semiconducting@xcite , as crn is sometimes reported@xcite to be , while tin and vn are superconductors @xcite . regarding magnetic properties , scn , tin and vn are paramagnets@xcite",
    ", con has been only recently synthesized @xcite and is also found paramagnetic . for crn ,",
    "strong experimental evidence supports antiferromagnetism below a nel temperature t@xmath1273 - 286 k@xcite , and recent measurements suggest for fen antiferromagnetism@xcite as well .    even for the structural properties there is no uniformity .",
    "most of compounds have rocksalt structure , but there are exceptions : con has zns - type structure@xcite , and fen has been observed in both zns- and nacl - type phases ( depending on the growth conditions ) .",
    "crn seems to be very peculiar in that it is the only one of the series that does not have a ground state with cubic symmetry .",
    "its transition from paramagnetism to antiferromagnetism at @xmath5 is accompanied by a structural distortion from cubic to orthorhombic ( pnma ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "the body of information on @xmath3 tmn properties is rather fragmentary ( and sometime contradictory ) , and much vital data are unavailable .",
    "most of these compounds are difficult to synthesize , and the strong tendency of nitrogen to form dimers leads to difficulty in growing defect - free tmn crystals@xcite ( a problem also common to other nitride compounds such as iii - v semiconductors ) .",
    "thus far , nothing is known about mnn , nin , cun and znn , and only recently it has become possible to synthesize fen@xcite and con@xcite .",
    "due to the difficulty in preparing stoichiometric crn , and to a strong sensitivity of its properties on the concentration of defects , reports on the properties of crn in the literature are not entirely consistent .",
    "et al._@xcite have studied the effects of variation of @xmath6 in crn@xmath7 and produced samples with @xmath6 up to 0.997 , taking care to keep them oxygen - free . only at this high n composition",
    "is the antiferromagnetic transition sharp , and it occurs at t@xmath0=286 k. the transformation is first order , with hysterisis of 2 - 3 k as measured by linear expansivity , susceptibility , and resistivity . at lower values of @xmath6 ( down to 0.980 ) the transition temperature decreases to 273 k and the transition width increases .    at @xmath6=0.997 , the properties reported by browne _ et al . _",
    "are as follows .",
    "the resistivity slope @xmath8 is positive ( metallic - like ) on both sides of the transition , and @xmath9 decreases by 30 - 35% across the transition , in opposition to the semiconducting behavior reported by herle _",
    "et al._@xcite due to the polycrystalline nature , and specific density only 70% of the bulk , the value of the resistivity @xmath10 is only an upper bound .",
    "the susceptibility slope changes from a small negative value @xmath11 k@xmath12 above t@xmath0 to a positive value of similar magnitude below t@xmath0 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath13 is @xmath1 35% .",
    "these data are most consistent with a metal - to - metal transition at t@xmath0 in which a substantial fraction of the fermi surface is gapped by structural distortion and/or the onset of magnetic order .",
    "et al._@xcite have produced thin films of crn@xmath7 with 1.0 @xmath14 @xmath6 @xmath14 1.2 .",
    "these films , like the samples with @xmath6 @xmath14 1 of browne _ et al .",
    "_ , have t@xmath0 @xmath14 280 k. none of the transitions are as sharp as for the @xmath6 = 0.997 samples .",
    "it is clear that properties are sensitive to n overstoichiometry as well as to understoichiometry .",
    "not surprisingly , the theoretical literature is also not very extensive .",
    "some work on the @xmath3 tmns in the cubic paramagnetic phase has been reported@xcite , but very little is reported for compounds that undergo reconstructions accompanied by , and perhaps driven by , magnetic ordering , as may be the case in crn@xcite and fen@xcite .",
    "investigation of compounds that are so close in chemical composition but with so different physical properties are important in providing insight into basic mechanisms such as magnetic ordering , formation of local moments , and relations of this phenomena with basic features such as structure and density of states .",
    "ab initio calculations , which can separate the effects of magnetism and structural distortions , are very effective in such cases . in this paper",
    "we focus on crn and investigate the occurrence of magnetic ordering for the cubic structure and for the ( observed ) orthorhombic structure .    a basic characteristic of crn in the cubic paramagnetic phase , which makes it easy to understand the instability towards ferromagnetism , is the very high density of states @xcite at the fermi energy ( e@xmath15 ) .",
    "less easy to understand is the competition between afm and fm ordering , and the relation between spin polarization , magnetic order , and structural distortion .",
    "other cases are well known where high dos drives systems to structural ( e.g. vo@xmath16 , from tetragonal to monoclinic ) or spin polarized ( cro@xmath16 , from pm to half - metallic fm ) transitions . in fact",
    ", the isovalent compound mon shows an interesting parallel . due to the peak at e@xmath15 in the density of states in the cubic phase ,",
    "it was predicted to be a high temperature superconductor@xcite ( compared to conventional superconductors ) .",
    "it was subsequently shown by calculation@xcite that it is structurally unstable in the cubic structure , which explains the fact that experimentalists had been unable to grow stoichiometric samples . in the case of crn",
    "the cubic structure is stable at high temperature , but at t@xmath0 there is the simultaneous occurrence of both structural transformation and magnetic order .",
    "giving insight into possible relations between these transitions , and identifying the driving force for the transition , is the main motivation of the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ csmc ] a review of the crn crystal structure is given , together with a brief description of our calculational procedure . in section [ sp ]",
    "we show structural and energetic results for crn in different magnetic phases .",
    "finally , section [ ep ] is dedicated to an analysis of the electronic properties .",
    "results for density of states , band energies , and some fermi surface properties are presented and discussed .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] a tridimensional perspective ( top panel ) and a top view down onto the ( 001 ) plane ( bottom panel ) of the crn structure is shown .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes of the unit cell for the afm phase are oriented along the [ 1@xmath200 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] directions of the cubic nacl structure , respectively .",
    "the shear distortion consists of a contraction ( not visible in the figure ) of the angle @xmath21 from the cubic ( @xmath21= 90@xmath22 ) to a @xmath12@xmath22 smaller observed value .",
    "the square symmetry in the ( 001 ) plane is broken so that the coordination of the atoms reduces to 2 in the ( 001 ) plane .",
    "orthorhombic and cubic structures are connected by the relations @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    from experiments ,",
    "two possible antiferromagnetic spin alignments have been proposed@xcite .",
    "we consider here primarily the arrangement determined by corliss _",
    "et al._@xcite and depicted by arrows on cr sites in figure [ fig1 ] : double ferromagnetic layers parallel to the [ 110 ] direction alternate in such a way to form a four - layer antiferromagnetic orthorhombic unit cell ( 4 formula units and 8 atoms per cell ) , with non vanishing magnetization field planarly averaged along [ 1@xmath200 ] . as a result of this ordering , six of the 12 ( cubic ) cr",
    "neighbors have spin parallel and six spin antiparallel .",
    "of the six ( cubic ) next nearest neighbors , four have antiparallel spin .",
    "reports for the magnetic moments @xmath26 = 2.36 @xmath27 per cr atom .",
    "another experiment@xcite gives a much larger @xmath26 = 3.17 @xmath27 that seems to be much less reasonable .",
    "indeed , the first value is consistent with a cr to n charge transfer of @xmath28 2 electrons , while the second would imply an almost completely ionized configuration cr@xmath29n@xmath30 that is not to be expected ( charge transfer would be larger than in more ionic compounds such as transition - metal oxides ) .",
    "another motivation for this work is technical and centers on our method of calculation .",
    "these local - spin - density calculations are performed within a plane wave and ultrasoft pseudopotential@xcite ( uspp ) framework . here",
    "we want to furnish a sound assessment of accuracy and efficiency of the use of pseudopotentials for the study of materials historically considered impossible , or at best difficult , to be treated within a plane wave pseudopotential method .",
    "crn is a difficult test , being the combination of a @xmath3 transition metal and a first - row atom , with high density of states at e@xmath15 and a reconstruction accompanied by antiferromagnetism .    to our knowledge",
    "this is the first plane - wave study of afm crn ( only one augmented - spherical - wave calculation@xcite is present in literature ) .",
    "the use of pseudopotentials to study magnetic compounds itself is only two years old@xcite .",
    "use of uspp for magnetic materials is very new@xcite and presents the essential feature : constructing smooth ( but well transferable ) uspp allows us to obtain converged results ( within 1 mry for the total energy ) at energy cut - off of 29 ry ( @xmath12600 plane waves per crn unit ) , whereas ordinary norm - conserving pseudopotentials would require at least the twice as large a cutoff value , hence four times as many plane waves .",
    "the chosen core radii are 2.20 a.u . , 2.45 a.u . and 2.45 a.u . for s , p and d projectors of cr pseudopotential ,",
    "respectively ; 1.30 a.u . for both s and p components of n pseudopotential .",
    "two projectors for each angular channel ( corresponding to energies @xmath13 ev apart ) were used .",
    "the ( highest in energy ) p component was employed as local part .",
    "the non - linear core correction ( nlcc)@xcite was used to ensure the best degree of transferability . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the nlcc is particularly important for spin - polarized situations .",
    "indeed , pseudopotentials are generated in a non - spin - polarized reference configuration .",
    "such a procedure is justified only to the extent that the pseudopotential is perfectly descreened by the valence dependence . in case",
    "the overlap between core and valence charge is large , as it happens for transition metals , the non - linearity of the exchange - correlation potential induces incomplete descreening , and thereby a pseudopotential dependence on the valence configuration . also , the lsd exchange - correlation potential is even more non - linear than the lda one@xcite , and further affects the pseudopotential accuracy .",
    "the nlcc set the pseudopotential free from its exchange - correlation dependence , thus recovering its transferability .",
    "finally , no use of relativistic correction was made .",
    "the performance of cr and n pseudopotentials has been individually tested . in particular , with the former we obtain an accurate description of bcc bulk cr ( e.g. a calculated lattice constant within 0.5 % the experimental measure ) , whereas the latter has been estensively employed in a long investigation of semiconducting iii - v nitrides compounds ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential was that of ceperley and alder , as parametrized by perdew and zunger@xcite .",
    "we sampled the irreducible zone ( ibz ) with special k - points ( @xmath31 for self - consistent calculations , from 150 up to 530 k points to evaluate the densities of states ) .",
    "in table [ energy ] our results for energies and magnetic moments of pm , fm and afm phases of crn are shown . for a fair comparison between theory and experiment we investigated , together with the afm double - sheet ordering found by corliss _",
    "et al _ ( here indicated as afm@xmath32}$ ] ) , other two kinds of afm orderings : the single - sheet afm@xmath33}$ ] phase , similar to the afm@xmath32}$ ] but with single ferromagnetic sheets having alternated spin along [ 110 ] ( a tetragonal structure with 4 atoms per cell ) , and the afm@xmath34}$ ] phase , consisting on single ferromagnetic sheets parallel to the ( 111 ) plane which alternate the sign of the spin along [ 111 ] ( i.e. a trigonal structure common in @xmath3 transition metal monoxides with 6 cr and 6 n layers in the cell ) . for each phase , we present results obtained in both cubic and distorted structures . for the cubic structures we consider both experimental and theoretical lattice constants ( i.e. the @xmath35 obtained by energy minimization of the respective phases ) . to add the further effect of the planar distortion , we extract the value of @xmath21 from the experimental structure given in ref .",
    "( @xmath21=88.23@xmath22 ) .",
    "a number of results for the pm cubic ( nacl ) phase of crn are present in literature@xcite .",
    "in particular , shimizu , shirai , and suzuki@xcite performed lattice constant calculations for the whole series of 3d tmn s . for crn",
    "they report @xmath36=7.56 a.u . which underestimates the experimental value @xmath37=7.81 a.u .",
    "for the afm@xmath32}$ ] phase ( a 10% smaller volume ) .",
    "our calculation gives @xmath36=7.73 a.u .",
    ", a value 1% smaller than experiment .",
    "the discrepance between our @xmath36 value and that of ref . can be ascribed to the different form of the exchange - correlation used and , moreover to the fact that , differently from ref .",
    ", we perform a non - relativistic calculation .    for a true comparison with the experiments , however , it is necessary to calculate the lattice constant for the cubic afm@xmath32}$ ] structure .",
    "we find @xmath38=7.876 a.u .",
    ", less then 1% above experiment .",
    "thus , according to our calculations , polarization ( from pm to afm@xmath32}$ ] order ) produces an expansion of 2% of the lattice constant .",
    "looking at table [ energy ] , we see that the afm@xmath32}$ ] distorted phase is favoured overall .",
    "the theoretical determination of @xmath35 produces , with respect to the experimental structure , an energy gain ( e@xmath39-e@xmath40 ) of 0.02 ev / formula unit ; anyway , in general , results obtained for theoretical and experimental lattice constants are close each other to within 0.01 ev .",
    "the spin polarization pm to afm gives a considerable energy gain ( @xmath1 0.15 ev to @xmath1 0.3 ev per formula unit , depending on the magnetic phase ) , thus , polarization greatly lowers the energy regardless of the type of magnetic order .",
    "this is a sign that there is likely to be disordered local moment behavior above t@xmath0 , although it is not so evident from the existing data.@xcite also , all afm phases are more stable than the fm one .",
    "now , we examine in more detail the competition among the different afm phases .",
    "the afm@xmath34}$ ] is worthwile to be considered because it represents the usual kind of afm order observed for nacl - type structures .",
    "indeed , a peculiarity of the afm@xmath34}$ ] phase ( unless one considers noncollinear arrangements ) is having all the six ( fcc ) second neighbor moments antiparallel , a common characteristic of most of nacl structures , as revealed by neutron diffraction studies@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we found the afm@xmath34}$ ] clearly disfavoured with respect to the afm@xmath32}$ ] and only slightly favoured on the fm phase .",
    "more interesting and somewhat surprising is the result for the afm@xmath33}$ ] phase : we found it to be clearly the most stable of the cubic structures .",
    "it is characterized by four spin - parallel and eight spin - antiparallel first neighbors , and all the six second neighbors have parallel spins ( an arrangement very different from the other afm phases here considered ) .",
    "but if the planar distortion is added , the energetic order of afm@xmath33}$ ] and afm@xmath32}$ ] phases is reversed , and the afm@xmath32}$ ] becomes the lowest , thus recovering the agreement with the experiment .",
    "indeed , the distortion causes , for the afm@xmath32}$ ] , the shortening of metal - metal distances between spin - antiparallel cr atoms , that arguably causes an energy gain , and the stretching of spin - parallel cr atoms in the ( 100 ) plane ( producing an energy loss ) , resulting , as a matter of fact , in an appreciable net decrease of energy ( @xmath1 0.07 ev / formula unit ) .",
    "the same can not occur for the afm@xmath33}$ ] , because no spin - antiparallel first neighbors are in the ( 100 ) plane , and thus the distortion does not allow any stabilization ( actually we found an energy increase of @xmath1 0.01 ev / formula unit ) .    thus , the resulting physical picture is the following : if we consider the spin ordering in a constrained cubic symmetry , the afm@xmath33}$ ] phase , having the largest number of fcc spin - antiparallel first - neighbors ( 8 , against 6 of both afm@xmath32}$ ] and afm@xmath34}$ ] phases ) is favoured .",
    "but if we allow the symmetry to relax , the ( 100 ) planar anisotropy of the afm@xmath32}$ ] phase causes some of the spin - antiparallel first neighbors to approach each other , producing a strong structural stabilization .",
    "we argue that in the cubic structure the bonds between spin - antiparallel metal atoms are under condition of large tensile stress ( larger than that in the bonds between spin - parallel atoms , anyway ) and the cubic to orthorombic transition relieves part of this stress .",
    "then , the planar distortion plays a key role in the competition between afm phases , and the stress relief is reasonably to be considered the ultimate driving force towards distortion .    for magnetic moments ( we show in the table only values referred to the experimental structures , being very close to that obtained for the theoretical ones )",
    "we obtain values ranging between @xmath26=1.9 @xmath27 and 2.3 @xmath27 per cr atom . in particular , for the afm@xmath32}$ ] phase our value @xmath26=2.15 @xmath27 is in fair agreement with the experimental @xmath26=2.36 @xmath27 of ref . , and the theoretical @xmath26=2.41 @xmath27 of ref . .",
    "the stabilization due to the magnetic ordering can be understood from the analysis of the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "figure [ dos_pm ] shows the pm crn dos for the cubic structure in orthorhombic symmetry obtained from broadened eigenvalues from a regular mesh of k points in the irreducible zone , which is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , in what follows all quantities refer to the theoretical lattice constant .",
    "as pointed out previously@xcite , among the series of 3d tmns , crn ( as well as nacl - type fen @xcite ) is distinguished for the high dos at e@xmath15 .",
    "our dos agrees well with the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave calculation of ref .. at least 95% of dos at e@xmath15 comes from cr @xmath41 states , and the remaining contribution is due to the n @xmath42 states .",
    "however , the dos peak at e@xmath15 is _ entirely _ due to cr @xmath41 states , indicating that the peak arises from flat bands solely cr in character .",
    "singh and klein@xcite have emphasized that this peak is cr @xmath43 . as we show below , it is not possible to identify this flat band solely from symmetry line data .",
    "figure [ dos_afm ] shows total and partial doss of the cubic afm@xmath32}$ ] structure .",
    "the peak at e@xmath15 has disappeared : the afm@xmath32}$ ] ordering causes a large band splitting and the depletion ( a pseudogap @xmath1 0.5 ev wide ) in the dos of a sharp region around e@xmath15 .",
    "up- and down - polarized atoms are connected by translation plus spin - flip symmetry operations , thus contributions to dos coming from the type of cr and n atoms not shown in the figure are equal to that shown but with up and down components interchanged . for n ( middle panel of figure [ dos_afm ] ) magnetic effects are negligible , although not zero by symmetry : the magnetic moments are only @xmath10.01 @xmath27 . for cr ( bottom ) the dos around e@xmath15 clearly resembles the total one , hence the band splitting due to the polarization arises almost entirely from cr @xmath41 states .      notwithstanding the strong stabilization by moving states away from e@xmath15 , afm@xmath32}$ ] ordering does not manage to open a gap at the e@xmath15 , and the system is still a ( relatively low carrier density ) metal , at variance with one@xcite experimental characterization as a small gap semiconductor but in agreement with the results of browne _ et al._@xcite on very nearly stoichiometric samples . to provide a clearer picture of our prediction , in figure [ dos_det ] we show a band - resolved dos including only the four bands ( see section [ bsmo ] ) that cross or touch the fermi level .",
    "these doss were calculated from a 528 k - points mesh , interpolated using a fourier spline technique@xcite , and evaluated using the linear tetrahedron method .",
    "full lines refer to the distorted ( experimental ) structure afm@xmath32}$ ] bands , while dashed lines refer to the cubic afm@xmath32}$ ] phase .",
    "basically three bands contribute to the dos at e@xmath15 , and a fourth band has its minimum essentially at e@xmath15 .    in table [ omega ] the band - by - band values of the band filling , density of states at e@xmath15 , and the fermi velocities are given . from the totals we can evaluate the drude plasma energies @xmath44 :",
    "@xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes any of the cartesian axes .",
    "we obtain @xmath47 = 2.3 ev , @xmath48 = 2.0 ev , @xmath49 = 2.6 ev , so the non - cubic nature is evident but is only a @xmath50 15% effect .",
    "this difference is due to the antiferromagnetism , not to the structural distortion whose effect we have found to be much smaller .",
    "these values of plasma energies are rather small for transition metal compounds , but are typical of metallic ( not semiconducting or even semimetallic ) behavior .",
    "we mention a technical detail about calculation of magnetic moments . in case of an afm structure with aligned spins along high symmetry directions",
    ", it is very suited for a plane - wave basis to extract magnetic moments from the planar average of local magnetization , which is a more direct and simple procedure than the common way of projecting plane waves onto atomic - like orbitals . in the top panel of figure [ magn ]",
    "the planar average of local magnetization along @xmath17 for the fm ( dashed line ) and afm@xmath32}$ ] ( full line ) phase is shown .",
    "peaks are in correspondence of atomic positions , and the integrals over interlayer distances give by construction the layer - by - layer magnetization , i.e. the magnetization per couple chromium - nitrogen , or , in practice , the magnetization per cr atom , being that of n atoms almost discardable . the idea to obtain contributions to some physical quantity coming from individual space regions , not accessible from its macroscopic ( or integrated ) value , using planar and",
    "macroscopic averages has been sometime used .",
    "it leaded , for example , to introduce quantities such as energy@xcite and stress@xcite density . in order to the integrals of the planar averages be well ( uniquely ) defined",
    ", a typical necessity is that the average is referred to an appropriate bulk symmetry plane ( a critical case is , for instance , the average on ( 111 ) direction for a zincblebde structure : the atomic layers are not equally spaced and the volume attained to a single atom is undefined ) .",
    "we return at figure [ magn ] below .    to complete the analysis of the dos , in figure [ dos_fm ] we present results for the fm phase of crn in the experimental structure .",
    "as expected , the total dos at the e@xmath15 is dominated by the cr @xmath41 states .",
    "ferromagnetism results in the splitting of up and down @xmath41 type bands , and a strong stabilization with respect to the pm phase occurs .",
    "the competition between antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism for metals is usually an intriguing question . in the present case",
    ", we can attribute the stronger afm stability to a larger average spin splitting of cr 3@xmath41 states .",
    "it is clear from top panel of figure [ magn ] that for afm@xmath32}$ ] there is larger magnetization on the cr atoms .",
    "this trend should also be reflected in the band splitting .",
    "a measure of the average band splitting per atom is taken to be :    @xmath51    _ i.e. _ the up and down exchange - correlation potential difference @xmath52 , weighted by the local magnetization , integrated over the inter - planar volume @xmath53 and normalized to the atomic moment .",
    "the integrand of equation [ eigsp ] is pictured in the bottom panel of figure [ magn ] ; the supralinear dependence of kohn - sham potential on magnetization leads to the difference between afm@xmath32}$ ] ( full line ) and fm ( dashed ) @xmath54 in the regions around the atoms , resulting in an integrated value ( over the interplanar distance ) of 2.58 ev for the distorted afm@xmath32}$ ] , 2.52 for the cubic afm@xmath32}$ ] , and 2.02 ev for the distorted fm phase .",
    "the calculated splitting roughly reflects the magnitude visible in the figures of dos previously discussed . in figure",
    "[ diff ] an expanded view of the partial dos of cr around e@xmath15 is shown .",
    "evidently , the afm@xmath32}$ ] dos has a minimun at e@xmath15 , whereas for the fm system e@xmath15 falls on the edge of the second peak of cr d states that is unoccupied in the pm phase ( see figure [ dos_pm ] ) .",
    "the band splitting mechanism is further clarified by analysis of band shifts .",
    "figures [ band_pm ] and [ band_afc ] show the pm and the afm@xmath32}$ ] band structures , respectively , calculated in the orthorhombic cell .",
    "the coordinates of the high - symmetry k - points are , in the orthorhombic reference system ( see bottom panel of figure [ band_pm ] ) , @xmath55=(@xmath56,0,0 ) , @xmath57=(0,@xmath58,0 ) , @xmath59=(0,@xmath58,@xmath60 ) , and @xmath61=(@xmath56,@xmath62,0 ) , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are given in section [ csmc ] . in the cubic pm phase , at points @xmath55 , @xmath57 , @xmath61 , and @xmath59 all bands are doubly degenerate , due to the fcc to orthorhombic band downfolding .",
    "symmetry breaking due to the afm@xmath32}$ ] ordering splits the degeneracy along the direction connecting points @xmath55 and @xmath61 , whereas the lattice shear ( @xmath66 90@xmath22 ) causes the band splitting at @xmath57 and @xmath59 .",
    "the former effect is the most effective in stabilizing the system .",
    "the splitting ( @xmath1 2 ev ) strongly depletes the region around e@xmath15 , leaving only few band crossings .",
    "it is particularly visible at @xmath55 by comparing cubic pm and afm@xmath32}$ ] band structures .",
    "the effect of lattice shear produces a further stabilization , i.e. a further band opening , but is much less spectacular .",
    "it is emphasized in figure [ band_pm ] : band energies shown along @xmath55-@xmath67-@xmath57 are those of the cubic pm phase , whereas along @xmath57-@xmath61-@xmath59 the figure reports values for the distorted structure , so that the splitting is visible at @xmath57 .",
    "this effect is very small ( its order of magnitude is only some tens of mev ) , and band structures of cubic and distorted afm@xmath32}$ ] phase ( figures [ band_afc ] and [ band_afd ] ) differ only in certain regions .",
    "an unusual feature that can be seen in figure [ band_afc ] is the coincidence ( or nearly so ) of e@xmath15 with four band crossings along the directions shown : two along the @xmath55-@xmath67 line , one along @xmath67-@xmath57 , and one at @xmath61 . at general k - points away from these crossings , the bands will repel , hence they will not contribute to n(e@xmath15 ) , but rather to a pseudogap at e@xmath15 .",
    "our first principles results for crn confirm most of the available experimental data .",
    "the observed ( 110 ) double - sheet distorted structure is found to be the lowest in energy , stable not only against paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases , but also with respect to other antiferromagnetic arrangements .",
    "we found the system to be a weak metal , with large magnetic moments on cr atoms .",
    "although the fundamental features favouring a certain spin arrangement with respect to another are still to be understood , we are able to clarify the role played by the distortion by disentangling its effect and that of the magnetic ordering .",
    "magnetic ordering is found to be dominant in determining both structural and magnetic properties of the system , with respect to which the distortion can be seen as a small perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , distortion appears decisive to resolve the competition among the different antiferromagnetic phases considered here .",

    "<S> crn is observed to undergo a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition with nel temperature t@xmath0 @xmath1 280 k , accompanied by a shear distortion from cubic nacl - type to orthorhombic pnma structure . </S>",
    "<S> our first - principles plane wave calculations , based on ultrasoft pseudopotentials , confirm that the distorted antiferromagnetic phase with spin configuration arranged in double ferromagnetic sheets along the [ 110 ] direction is energetically much more stable than the paramagnetic phase , and also slightly favored over the ferromagnetic and other examined antiferromagnetic phases . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gain from polarization is much larger than that from distortion ; nevertheless , the distortion is decisive in resolving the competition among the antiferromagnetic phases : the anisotropy in the ( 100 ) plane arising from the ferromagnetic double - sheet magnetic order allows a small but important energy gain upon the cubic - to - orthorhombic transition . </S>",
    "<S> although antiferromagnetic order leads to a large depletion of states around fermi level , it does not open a gap . </S>",
    "<S> the system is metallic with occupied hole and electron pockets of fermi surface containing @xmath2 carriers of each sign per formula unit . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous occurrence of structural distortion and antiferromagnetic order , as well as the competition between antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism , is analyzed . </S>"
