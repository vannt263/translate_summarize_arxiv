    "blind surveys , and targeted observations of known sources ( quasi - stellar objects and radio galaxies ) , with mjy sensitivity at submillimeter ( submm ) wavelengths have revealed a population of ir luminous galaxies at high redshift , with luminosities @xmath15 l@xmath16 , placing them in the category of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; see reviews by blain et al .",
    "2003 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "current models suggest that this population may represent the formation of large spheroidal galaxies at @xmath17 ( blain et al .",
    "if star formation dominates the dust heating in the high-@xmath0 systems , then the implied star formation rates ( up to @xmath18 m@xmath16 year@xmath6 ) are such that a significant fraction of the stars in a spheroidal galaxy could be formed in 10@xmath19 years .",
    "however , in many cases a contribution to the ir luminosity from dust heated by an agn can not be precluded ( andreani et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "an important observation in this regard has been the detection of giant reservoirs of molecular gas via co emission lines , with gas masses @xmath20 m@xmath16 , providing the requisite material for star formation ( carilli et al .",
    "however , co can be excited at relatively low densities  with a critical density for excitation of only @xmath21 @xmath3 for the lower @xmath22 transitions , where @xmath22 is the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "hence it is a good tracer of the total molecular gas content of galaxies , but it is a relatively poor tracer of the denser gas directly involved in massive star formation .",
    "this fact is accentuated by the non - linear relation between ir luminosity and co luminosity in star - forming galaxies , with ir luminosity increasing as co luminosity roughly to the power 1.7 ( gao & solomon 2004a , b ) .",
    "the non - linear increase in ir luminosity with increasing co luminosity has been interpreted as an increase in the star formation efficiency , defined as the ratio of star formation rate to total gas mass , with increasing star formation rate ( solomon et al .",
    "1992 ; gao & solomon 2004b ) .",
    "local ( z @xmath23 ) ulirgs show strong hcn emission ( solomon , downes , & radford 1992 ; gao & solomon 2004a ) .",
    "hcn emission traces much denser gas ( critical density for excitation of the lower order transitions @xmath24 ; evans 1999 ) than co emission due to a higher dipole moment . in the milky way",
    ", very strong hcn emission is found in molecular cloud cores , the sites of star formation , and not in the more massive but less dense cloud envelopes ( helfer & blitz 1997 ) .",
    "strong hcn emission is therefore an indicator of active star formation .",
    "this fact has been demonstrated for external galaxies by the tight , linear correlation between ir and hcn luminosity for star - forming galaxies over a wide range of ir luminosity ( 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath26 l@xmath16 ; gao & solomon 2004a , b ) .",
    "for the most luminous infrared galaxies the hcn line luminosities range from 1/4 to 1/10 that of the co luminosity , as compared with ordinary spiral galaxies where the ratio is typically 1/25 to 1/40 . the fact that the ratio of ir luminosity to hcn luminosity is",
    "the same in ulirgs as in lower luminosity galaxies suggests that ulirgs , like the lower luminosity galaxies , are primarily powered by star formation , and that the hcn luminosity is a good measure of the mass of actively star - forming cloud cores ( gao & solomon 2004b ) .",
    "in essence , the star formation which is responsible for the ir emission has a rate that is linearly proportional to the mass of dense ( ie .",
    "hcn - emitting ) molecular gas , but not to the total molecular gas , as traced by co.    the potential of hcn observations as a star formation diagnostic at high redshift was demonstrated recently with the detection of hcn ( 1 - 0 ) emission from the cloverleaf quasar at @xmath27 ( h1413 + 117 ) using the very large array ( vla ) ( solomon et al .",
    "these observations have proven instrumental in the physical interpretation of the starburst - agn connection in this system ( section 5 ) .",
    "more recently , hcn ( 1 - 0 ) emission has been detected from iras  f10214 + 4724 using the green bank telescope ( vanden bout , solomon , & maddalena 2004 ) , which may also be an agn - starburst system .",
    "the starburst - agn connection has taken on new importance with the discovery of the black hole mass  bulge mass relation , suggesting a `` causal connection between the formation and evolution of the black hole and the bulge '' ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a search for hcn emission from four high redshift galaxies using the vla .",
    "the sensitivity of these observations is such that we could detect the sources at the level seen for low @xmath0 galaxies , given their ir luminosities .",
    "we combine these results with three sources from the literature , and discuss the relationship between hcn and ir luminosity for high @xmath0 ulirgs , and possible consequences for star formation .",
    "we assume a standard concordance cosmology throughout , with h@xmath28 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the four sources were selected for high ir luminosity ( @xmath31 l@xmath16 ) , strong co emission , and therefore a precise redshift determination which allows for study of hcn lines with the vla , with the obvious requirement that the hcn lines redshift into one of the vla receiver bands .",
    "three were originally discovered as optical or radio quasars , while the fourth is a submm - selected galaxy , with no evidence for an agn . in the analsys below",
    "we also include three recent high redshift hcn detections from the literature : iras 10214 + 4724 at @xmath32 ( solomon & vanden bout 2004 ) , br 1202 + 0725 at @xmath33 ( isaak et al .",
    "2004 ) , and h1413 + 117 ( the cloverleaf ) at @xmath34 ( solomon et al .",
    "all three of the sources are characterized by strong thermal ir emission , and show evidence for an agn in their optical spectra .",
    "a key point in our analysis is the derivation of the far - ir luminosities .",
    "most of the values quoted herein ( table 2 ) were recently computed by beelen et al .",
    "( 2004 , in prep ) using single temperature grey body models fit to all the current photometric measurements . for most of the sources",
    "the observational data are limited to the rayleigh - jeans side of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , with only marginal sampling of the thermal dust peak ( benford et al .",
    "1999 , priddey & mcmahon 2001 , beelen et al .",
    "2004 , in prep ) .",
    "hence , the dust temperatures are poorly constrained .",
    "the mean source sed of high-@xmath0 sources in the beelen et al .",
    "analysis has @xmath35 and a dust emissivity index of @xmath36 , characteristic of ulirgs at low redshift ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "however , for most of the sources the poor sampling of the dust emission peak implies that we can not rule out a lower mass , but higher temperature dust component ( @xmath37 k ) which would dominate in the ( rest - frame ) mid - ir ( @xmath38 to 40@xmath39 m ) , perhaps heated by an agn .",
    "this hot mid - ir component could dominate the total ir emission ( ie .",
    "integrated from 1 to 1000@xmath39 m ) , but contribute only a fraction of ( @xmath40 ) to the far - ir luminosity ( @xmath41 to 120 @xmath39 m ) . for this analysis",
    "we have derived the luminosity by integrating over a modified black body fitted to the rest - frame far - ir seds of each object , and we set a value @xmath42 when not enough photometric data points are available to fit both @xmath43 and t. the one notable exception from the literature is the cloverleaf quasar ( h1413 + 117 ) , for which the ir sed is well sampled in frequency ( weiss et al .",

    "we have only included the cool component in the ir luminosity for the cloverleaf .",
    "it is possible that some of the other sources in table 2 , in particular those harboring known agn , have similar hot dust components .",
    "future sensitive observations at higher frequencies ( @xmath81 ghz and above ) are required to test this hypothesis .",

    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , will improve the sensitivity in the millimeter regime by more than an order of magnitude relative to current instruments .",

    "<S> current data and models suggest that these high @xmath0 ir luminous galaxies represent a major starburst phase in the formation of spheroidal galaxies , although many of the sources also host luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , such that a contribution to the dust heating by the agn can not be precluded . </S>",
    "<S> hcn emission is a star formation indicator , tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas within star - forming molecular clouds ( n(h@xmath1 ) @xmath2 @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hcn luminosity is linearly correlated with ir luminosity for low redshift galaxies , unlike co emission which can also trace gas at much lower density . </S>",
    "<S> we report a marginal detection of hcn ( 1 - 0 ) emission from the @xmath4 qso j1409 + 5628 , with a velocity integrated line luminosity of @xmath5 k km s@xmath6 pc@xmath7 , while we obtain 3@xmath8 upper limits to the hcn luminosity of the @xmath9 qso j0751 + 2716 of @xmath10 k km s@xmath6 pc@xmath7 , @xmath11 k km s@xmath6 pc@xmath7 for the @xmath12 starburst galaxy j1401 + 0252 , and @xmath13 k km s@xmath6 pc@xmath7 for the @xmath14 qso j1148 + 5251 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the hcn data on these sources , plus three other high-@xmath0 ir luminous galaxies , to observations of lower redshift star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the hcn / far - ir luminosity ratios ( or limits ) for all the high @xmath0 sources are within the scatter of the relationship between hcn and far - ir emission for low @xmath0 star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are consistent with dust heating by a massive starburst in these systems , with two important caveats . </S>",
    "<S> first , about half the measurements are strictly upper limits to the hcn luminosities . and second , the ir spectral energy distributions for most of the high @xmath0 sources are well constrained only on the rayleigh - jeans side of the thermal dust peak . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a spatially resolved 42 ghz continuum image of the gravitational lens j0751 + 2716 . </S>"
