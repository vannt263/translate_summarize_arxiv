    "roughly speaking , given a set parameters @xmath5 and an optimization problem whose description depends on @xmath3 ( call it @xmath7 ) , _ parametric optimization _ is concerned with the behavior and properties of the optimal value as well as primal ( and possibly dual ) optimal solutions of @xmath7 , when @xmath15 varies in @xmath5 .",
    "this a quite challenging problem and in general one may obtain information locally around some nominal value @xmath16 of the parameter .",
    "there is a vast and rich literature on the topic and for a detailed treatment , the interested reader is referred to e.g. bonnans and shapiro @xcite and the many references therein .",
    "sometimes , in the context of optimization with data uncertainty , some probability distribution @xmath4 on the parameter set @xmath5 is available and in this context one is also interested in e.g. the distribution of the optimal value , optimal solutions , all viewed as random variables . in particular , for discrete optimization problems where cost coefficients are random variables with joint distribution @xmath4 , some bounds on the expected optimal value have been obtained .",
    "more recently natarajan et al .",
    "@xcite extended the earlier work in @xcite to even provide a convex optimization problem for computing the so - called _ persistency _ values optimization problem @xmath17 and a distribution @xmath4 on @xmath18 , the persistency value of the variable @xmath19 is @xmath20 at an optimal solution @xmath21 .",
    "] of ( discrete ) variables , for a particular distribution @xmath22 in a certain set @xmath23 of distributions .",
    "however , this convex formulation requires knowledge of the convex hull of a discrete set and approximations are needed .",
    "the approach is nicely illustrated on a discrete choice problem and a stochastic knapsack problem . for more details on persistency in discrete optimization ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite and the references therein .    in the context of polynomial equations whose coefficients are themselves polynomials of some parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "some specific `` parametric '' methods exist .",
    "for instance , one may compute symbolically once and for all , what is called a _ comprehensive _ grbner basis , i.e. , a fixed basis that is a grbner basis for all @xmath3 ; see weispfenning @xcite and more recently rostalski @xcite for more details .",
    "then when needed , one may compute the solutions for a specific value of the parameter @xmath15 , e.g. by the eigenvalue method of mller and stetter @xcite .",
    "however , one still needs to apply the latter method for each value of the prameter @xmath15 .",
    "a similar two - step approach is also proposed for homotopy ( instead of grbner bases ) methods in @xcite .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to show that in one restricts to the case of _ polynomial _ parametric optimization then all information about the optimal value and optimal solutions can be obtained , or at least , approximated as closely as desired .",
    "we here restrict our attention to parametric polynomial optimization , that is , when @xmath7 is described by _",
    "polynomial _ equality and inequality constraints on both the parameter vector @xmath15 and the optimization variables @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , the set @xmath5 is restricted to be a compact basic semi - algebraic set of @xmath25 , and preferably a set sufficiently simple so that one may obtain the moments of some probability measure on @xmath5 , absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "for instance if @xmath5 is a simple set ( like a simplex , a box ) one may choose @xmath4 to be the probability measure uniformly distributed on @xmath5 ; typical @xmath5 candidates are polyhedra . or sometimes , in the context of optimization with data uncertainty , @xmath4 is already specified .",
    "we also suppose that @xmath7 has a unique optimal solution for almost all values of the parameter @xmath3 . in this specific context",
    "we are going to show that one may get insightful information on the set of all global optimal solutions of @xmath7 , via what we call a _",
    "`` joint+marginal '' _ approach .",
    "our contribution is as follows : + ( a ) call @xmath26 ( resp .",
    "@xmath27 ) the optimal value ( resp .",
    "the set of optimal solutions ) of @xmath7 for the value @xmath3 of the parameter .",
    "we first define an infinite - dimensional optimization problem @xmath28 whose optimal value is exactly @xmath29 .",
    "any optimal solution of @xmath7 is a probability measure @xmath30 on @xmath31 with marginal @xmath4 on @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath30 encodes all information on the optimal solutions @xmath32 , @xmath3 . whence the name _ `` joint+marginal '' _",
    "as @xmath30 is a _ joint _ distribution of @xmath24 and @xmath15 , and @xmath4 is the _ marginal _ of @xmath30 on @xmath25 .",
    "\\(b ) next , we provide a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations of @xmath28 with associated sequence of optimal values @xmath33 , in the spirit of the hierarchy defined in @xcite .",
    "an optimal solution of the @xmath34-th semidefinite relaxation is a sequence @xmath35 indexed in the monomial basis @xmath36 of the subspace @xmath37_i$ ] of polynomials of degree at most @xmath38 .",
    "if for almost all @xmath3 , @xmath7 has a unique _ global _ optimal solution @xmath39 , then as @xmath40 , @xmath41 converges pointwise to the sequence of moments of @xmath30 defined in ( a ) .",
    "in particular , one obtains the distribution of the optimal solution @xmath6 , and therefore , one may approximate as closely as desired any polynomial functional of the solution @xmath6 , like e.g. the @xmath4-mean or variance of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , if the optimization variable @xmath10 is boolean then one may approximate as closely as desired its _ persistency _ @xmath11 ( i.e. , the probability that @xmath42 in an optimal solution @xmath6 ) , as well as a a necessary and sufficient condition for this persistency to be @xmath13 .",
    "\\(c ) finally , let @xmath43 be the vector @xmath44 .",
    "then as @xmath40 , and for every @xmath45 , the sequence @xmath46 converges to @xmath47 for the measurable function @xmath48 . in other words ,",
    "the sequence @xmath49 is the moment sequence of the measure @xmath50 on @xmath5 . and so , the @xmath9-th coordinate function @xmath51 of optimal solutions of @xmath7 , @xmath3 , can be estimated , e.g. by maximum entropy methods . of course , the latter estimation is not pointwise but it still provides useful information on optimal solutions , e.g. the shape of the function @xmath8 , especially if the function @xmath52 is continuous , as illustrated on some simple examples .",
    "for instance , for parametric polynomial equations , one may use this estimation of @xmath6 as an initial point for newton s method for any given value of the parameter @xmath15 .    finally , the computational complexity of the above methodology is roughly the same as the moment approach described in @xcite for an optimization problem with @xmath53 variables since we consider the joint distribution of the @xmath54 variables @xmath24 and the @xmath55 parameters @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the approach is particularly interesting when the number of parameters is small , say @xmath13 or @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , in the latter case the max - entropy estimation has been shown to be very efficient in several examples in the literature ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the present status of sdp solvers , if no sparsity or symmetry is taken into account as proposed in e.g. @xcite , the approach is limited to small to medium size polynomial optimization problems .",
    "but this computational price may not seem that high in view of the ambitious goal of the approach .",
    "after all , keep in mind that by applying the moment approach to a single @xmath57-variables problem , one obtains information on global optimal solutions of an @xmath54-variables problem that depends on @xmath55 parameters , that is , one approximates @xmath54 _ functions _ of @xmath55 variables !",
