    "deep radio surveys provide the basic observational data , i.e. counts of the number of sources as a function of radio flux density , on which our understanding of the evolution of the radio source population in the universe is based ( e.g. longair 1966 ; rowan - robinson 1993 ; hopkins 1998 ; richards 2000 ; seymour 2004 , huynh 2005 ) .",
    "they have thus been the subject of considerable observational effort , particularly at frequencies of 1.4  ghz and above where angular resolution of a few arcsec , or better , is now commonplace and source confusion is unimportant .",
    "radio surveys are also forming an increasingly important part of multi - waveband observational programmes designed to study , in a more holistic manner , the broad - band evolution of various classes of sources such as agn and starburst galaxies . at low frequencies ( i.e. below 1.4  ghz ) , where steep spectrum sources such as starburst galaxies are expected to make a larger contribution relative to flatter spectrum agn ,",
    "radio surveys have , until recently , been limited to relatively bright flux limits ( @xmath7  mjy , valentijn 1980 ) .",
    "this has been primarily due to the lack of a radio telescope with the sensitivity and angular resolution required to reach to faint flux densities without being limited by source confusion .",
    "however , the giant metre - wave radio telescope ( gmrt ) of india s national centre for radio astrophysics now provides the necessary capabilities at low frequency .    in recent years",
    ", a number of deep radio surveys at 1.4  ghz have reached @xmath3jy levels ( e.g. hopkins 1998 ; richards 2000 ; ivison 2002 ; seymour 2004 , huynh 2005 ) .",
    "they confirm the previous result ( windhorst 1985 ) of an upturn of the euclidean normalised differential source counts below @xmath8  mjy .",
    "it is postulated that this upturn is due to a population of sources other than agn , and is commonly ascribed to starburst galaxies ( e.g. condon 1989 ; benn 1993 ) .",
    "the source counts have been modelled with a combination of an agn population ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1990 ) and a starburst population , both undergoing luminosity evolution ( e.g. hopkins 1998 ) .",
    "the previous deepest radio surveys at 610  mhz were made with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in the 1970s .",
    "katgert ( 1979 ) combined several such surveys to compute source counts down to 22  mjy .",
    "later wsrt surveys of galaxy clusters achieved lower detection limits ( e.g. 2.5  mjy , valentijn 1980 ) .",
    "however , none of these surveys was sufficiently deep to reveal the upturn in the source counts .    here",
    ", using gmrt observations , we present a deep 610  mhz survey of a survey field ( at @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , which is one of two very deep survey fields which we have observed in the x - ray , optical and ir bands , as well as at 1.4  ghz with the vla ( e.g. 2003 ; loaring 2005 ; seymour 2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we derive the 610  mhz source counts to a flux density limit ( @xmath11jy ) which is almost an order of magnitude fainter than the predicted upturn in the source counts . in this paper",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section [ section : obs ] .",
    "the construction of the catalogue is discussed in section [ section : analysis ] and we present the computation and modelling of the 610  mhz source counts in sections [ section : sourcecounts ] .",

    ", we assume a concordance cosmology with @xmath12kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( spergel 2003 ) .",
    "in august of 2004 , the @xmath0 field ( ra=@xmath16 and @xmath17 ) was observed for approximately 4.5 hours at 610  mhz with the gmrt .",
    "observations were carried out in dual band , spectral line mode , the former to maximise bandwidth and the latter to minimize chromatic aberration .",
    "two sidebands , each of 128 spectral channels of 125 khz , were centred on 602 and 618 mhz to give a total of 32 mhz bandwidth , with two independent circular polarisations recorded .",
    "visibilities were recorded every 17 seconds .",
    "observations were made of the phase calibration source 0054 + 035 every 45 minutes .",
    "the bandpass and absolute flux calibration were provided by several observations of 3c48 .",
    "all reduction was performed with the national radio astronomy observatory s aips software .",
    "the two sidebands were calibrated , preliminarily imaged and self calibrated independently and then combined in the @xmath18 plane before final imaging .",
    "the visibilities from each baseline and channel were carefully inspected and edited to remove interference , cross - talk between antennas , instrumental glitches , and the poor quality data recorded at the beginning of each pointing .",
    "absolute flux and bandpass calibration was performed in the standard way with 3c48 .",
    "phase calibration was performed using 0054 + 035 .",
    "each side band underwent 1 cycle of phase self - calibration .",
    "we experimented with further iterations , but found that they did not improve the image quality , or reduce the noise significantly .",
    "the two sidebands were then combined in the @xmath18 plane using the customised aips task uvflpdag/ ] .",
    "imaging was performed over a five by five grid of 1024@xmath191024 arcsec facets , with the phase of the data shifted to the tangent point at the centre of each facet .",
    "this strategy was chosen to ensure that no point on any image would be more than 10 arcmin from a tangential pointing position , minimizing the smearing of sources far from the phase tracking centre ( due to the breaking of the coplanar array assumption ) .",
    "the 256 channels were combined into one @xmath18 plane during the gridding process , imaged , and deconvolution performed with the aips task imagr .",
    "the final 25 image facets used for analysis were total intensity maps , with pixel size of 1 @xmath19 1 arcsec .",
    "made with a natural weighting , the central rms noise level achieved was 60  @xmath3jy with a restoring beam of 7.3 @xmath19 6.1 arcsec .",
    "areas of slightly higher rms noise surround the brightest 5 sources , the slightly extended structures of which are imperfectly deconvolved .",
    "special care was taken to remove the effects of bright sources located within the side lobes of the primary beam .",
    "small images were made of all surrounding sources found at 1.4  ghz in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon 1998 ) , including them in the cleaning process to ensure that their side lobes were properly removed from the science images .",
    "the maps of the individual facets were combined into a final mosaic using the aips task flatn , with no correction made for the degradation of the primary beam sensitivity at this stage .",
    "sources were extracted with the aips task sad .",
    "a conservative peak flux density detection limit of @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath21jy ) was used to minimize the number of noise spikes spuriously detected as sources . in the areas surrounding the five brightest sources , detection was performed separately with higher detection thresholds to account for the higher rms noise . within the 20 percent power radius of the gmrt primary beam at 610  mhz ( 32 arcmin ) , 213 sources were discovered above a 5@xmath4 peak flux density detection limit of 300  @xmath3jy . in order to determine the success of the sad source extraction , both the science images and the residual noise maps",
    "were carefully inspected .",
    "there were 8 extended sources where the gaussian model fit by sad inadequately described the data .",
    "the characteristics of these sources were determined using the aips task tvstat , and contour plots of them are shown in fig [ fig : contsoftvstat ] .",
    "five of these appear to contain two peaks joined by extended emission , i.e. double lobe sources .",
    "five further pairs of sources are separated by less than 20  arcsec , and could potentially be components of a double source .",
    "however , inspection of @xmath22 band imaging from suprimecam on the subaru telescope , and the digitised sky survey ( dss ) images shows that for four of these cases , separate optical counterpart candidates are present for the each source of radio emission , suggesting that they are unrelated .    the emission from the two sources constituting the remaining potential double is separated by 17  arcsec and shows no sign of extention in the direction linking the two .",
    "they have been included in the catalogue separately as sources 106 and 149 .    to search for further low surface brightness extended sources ,",
    "a low resolution map was made using a similar strategy to that presented in section [ section : imaging ] , but with the @xmath18 visibility data tapered . with a restoring beam of 12@xmath1912 arcsec , and an rms noise of 72  @xmath3jy ,",
    "ten further sources were discovered above 5@xmath4 , and added to the catalogue .      in the analysis of low signal to noise detections , noise spikes can cause gaussian fitting routines such as sad to poorly fit the width of a source , and hence inaccurately measure the total flux density .",
    "the ratio of the total to peak flux density ( @xmath23 ) is often used to probe this effect . in fig . [",
    "fig : res_env ] , we plot @xmath23 against @xmath24 . under the assumption that the measurement of any source as having @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath24 is due to the effect of noise",
    ", we use the the distribution of @xmath23 to define a criterion for a source to be considered resolved .",
    "we define an envelope that contains 98 percent of the sources with @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath24 is measured in mjy .",
    "this envelope is then mirrored about @xmath29 .",
    "any source within this envelope is considered unresolved , and its peak flux density taken as the best measure of its true flux density .",

    "solid lines indicate the upper and lower envelopes of the flux ratio distribution used to define an unresolved source .",
    "open circles are those sources considered resolved , while dots indicate those considered unresolved .",
    ", width=226 ]      there are a number of potential systematic effects which can cause erroneous measurements of flux density in deep radio observations .",
    "we evaluate the impact of each as follows .",
    "bandwidth smearing is the result of channels of finite bandwidth being used in an interferometric inversion that assumes monochromatic radiation .",
    "bandwidth smearing manifests itself as a radial blurring where the total flux density of a source is conserved , but the peak flux density is reduced .",
    "the effect increases with distance from the phase tracking centre .",
    "our strategy of keeping the 128 channels of each sideband separate until the @xmath18 gridding process ensured minimal bandwidth smearing , as the bandwidth over which this effect is relevant is the channel width of 125khz rather than the total sideband bandwidth of 16mhz .",
    "following chapter 18 of taylor ( 1999 ) , and approximating the @xmath18 coverage to a gaussian tapered circle , and the bandpass as square , the maximal theoretical effect of bandwidth smearing ( at the edge of the survey area ) for our data is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the measured peak intensity and @xmath33 is the true , unsmeared peak flux density .",
    "thus , bandwidth smearing is not considered further .",
    "sources rotate in the sky during the 17 second integration of each of our visibilities . in the simplified case of a target at a celestial pole ,",
    "the effect is essentially a smearing of each source in a direction tangential to that towards the phase tracking centre . in this simplified case , and approximating to a circular @xmath18 coverage with gaussian tapering ( again following taylor 1999 ) , the _ maximum _ theoretical effect at the edge of our survey area is a decrease of peak flux density of 4% , which for the majority of sources is smaller than the flux density measurement uncertainties .     across the primary beam .",
    "any time or bandwidth smearing effecting the data would manifest itself as a decline of the @xmath32 to @xmath25 ratio with radius , which is not seen.,width=226 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : bandtsmear ] shows the ratio of measured peak to measured total flux density of the observed sources .",
    "there is no apparent dependence of this ratio on radial distance from the phase tracking centre , as would be apparent should either of these smearing effects be important .",
    "a pearson s correlation test gives a value of -0.07 , implying no significant correlation .",
    "this result confirms that neither bandwidth nor time delay smearing has a significant effect on the quality of our images , and hence neither effect was considered further .",
    "sources far from the tangential pointing have their flux smeared out due to the inaccuracy of the assumption of a coplanar array in the interferometric fourier transform relation .",
    "our imaging strategy was expected to minimize this effect , but simulations were carried out to discover the magnitude of any remaining 3d smearing .",
    "a series of fake point sources were inserted into our @xmath18 coverage at a constant radius from the phase tracking centre of the field .",
    "this strategy isolates 3d smearing across a facet from the radially dependent bandwidth and time delay smearing across the primary beam .",
    "this modified @xmath18 data was then imaged with the same strategy as used for the science images .",
    "the ratio of @xmath34 to @xmath25 of these fake sources showed no dependence on distance from the local facet tangential pointing centre , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : facet ] .",
    "a pearson s correlation test gives 0.03 , indicative of no significant correlation .",

    "to @xmath25 for simulated sources , plotted against radial distance from the local facet tangent pointing centre at radii where any effect , if present , would be most noticeable .",
    "if 3d smearing were important , @xmath35 would show a decrease with radius from the local pointing centre.,width=226 ]      the clean algorithm used to deconvolve the dirty beam can , in presence of noise , reduce the measured flux of sources .",
    "the superposition of a noise spike with a sidelobe from a real source can lead to the placing of clean components at positions not occupied by real sources .",
    "the removal of the dirty beam from this position can then remove flux from real sources , and lead to systematic underestimation of their flux densities ( condon 1998 ; prandoni 2000a ; huynh 2005 ) . to quantify the effect of this clean bias on our measurements , a series of fake sources with known flux densities",
    "were inserted randomly into the full @xmath18 data at positions not coincident with any real sources , and away from the areas of high noise surrounding the brightest sources .",
    "imaging was then conducted in a manner similar to that used for the science images , and source extraction repeated .",
    "the measured flux densities of these model sources were then compared to the input model source parameters and the average offset as a function of flux is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cleanbias ] .",
    "the average measured offsets are consistent within the errors on the determination of the mean at each flux .",
    "the fitting of a simple constant to the offsets at these fluxes gives 44  @xmath3jy as the amount by which the imaging , cleaning and source extraction processes have reduced the true model source flux densities .",

    "we model the 610  mhz source counts presented here following the method of seymour ( 2004 ) , and refer the reader to their section 4.3 for details of the process . in brief , the local radio luminosity functions of both agn and of star forming galaxies are modified by simple power law evolution in luminosity and integrated over redshift to predict the source counts expected in deep radio surveys .    the agn luminosity function and evolution function are taken from rowan - robinson ( 1993 ) whose 1.4  ghz functions are based on survey work at 2.7  ghz by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) .",
    "they split the local agn population into two types , characterised by flat and steep radio spectra . in this study ,",
    "the steep spectrum luminosity function was shifted to 610  mhz assuming an average spectral index of @xmath38 . for the flat spectrum population ( @xmath39 ) the lunimosity function at 610  mhz was taken as identical to that at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the local starburst radio luminosity function was taken from sadler ( 2002 ) , who take a sample of 242 radio sources detected in the nvss which are identified as starburst galaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey . the sadler ( 2002 )",
    "radio luminosity function was shifted to 610  mhz assuming an average spectral index of @xmath38 , suitable for the optically thin synchrotron radiation expected from supernova remnants associated with rapid star formation . following previous authors ,",
    "the luminosity evolution was parametrized as @xmath40 .        in order to fit this model to the 610  mhz counts , and obtain useful errors on @xmath5 , we again follow previous authors and fix the contribution to the counts of the agn populations .",
    "the 610  mhz source counts above @xmath24 mjy are well described by the model of the combined agn population luminosity and evolution functions as taken from rowan - robinson ( 1993 ) . also , we assume zero density evolution , and hence the only parameter left free to vary is the power law index of the starburst population luminosity evolution ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we have performed a @xmath41 fit , and the best - fitting value is @xmath42 , where the errors are given at the 1@xmath4 level .",
    "when source counts are rising steeply with decreasing flux density it is likely that more sources will be scattered by the noise towards brighter fluxes than to dimmer fluxes .",
    "this effect is expected to be greatest at the flux limit of our survey . to quantify the effect that such eddington bias has on source counts",
    ", we use the best - fitting population model of section [ section : model ] extrapolated to @xmath43jy as a prediction of the source counts below the detection limit .",
    "a population of fake sources with a flux density distribution determined from this model were inserted randomly into a residual noise map .",
    "the input flux density of each source was reduced , dependent upon position , to account for the attenuation of the primary beam sensitivity .",
    "sources were then extracted from these maps and counts constructed from these detections , following the same method as used for the real sources in section [ section : construct ] , and the process repeated 10 times .",
    "the difference between the average detected differential source count and that of the input model gives an estimate of the _ net _ up - scatter , i.e. the eddington bias .",
    "only the lowest flux bin shows a significant offset , with the average measured differential source count overestimating the inserted model value by 21 percent . in order to make a first - order approximation to the true source counts we therefore reduced the observed counts in the lowest flux bin by 21 percent and refitted the model , obtaining a value of @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the 21 percent correction factor is actually slightly larger than we should be applying to return to the true source counts as it is based on an overestimate of the real value of @xmath5 , corresponding to a steeper unnormalised source count and hence to a larger number of up - scattered sources than is the case in reality .",
    "however the 21 percent factor is not a great deal too high as we can see by repeating the simulations described above , assuming @xmath44 .",
    "in this case we find that the simulated source counts exceeded the model , in the lowest flux bin , by 19 percent thereby almost , but not quite , returning us to our starting position .",
    "thus we adopt an intermediate correction factor of 20 percent to the counts in the observed lowest flux bin which , when refitted , still provides @xmath45 . the corrected source counts and best fitting model are shown in fig .",

    "a study of iras sources believed to be tracing starforming galaxies by saunders ( 1990 ) found evidence for luminosity evolution of @xmath50 .",
    "hopkins ( 2004 ) finds @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the powerlaw index of density evolution ) as the best - fitting evolutionary scenario when both 1.4  ghz source counts and other star formation rate indicators are considered simultaneously .",
    "the best - fitting value of @xmath5 at 610  mhz ( @xmath54 ) is therefore consistent , within errors , with the results from the plethora of measurements at 1.4  ghz .",
    "this agreement suggests that observations at both frequencies are probing similar source populations , and that the sources which consitute the sub - mjy bump can be explained by the an evolving population of starburst galaxies with steep ( @xmath55 ) radio spectra .",
    "the basic two population model used here may over simplify the true situation in faint radio sources .",
    "agn and starburst activity can occur simultaneously in the same galaxy , and their common requirement of gas reservoirs would indicate that they are not entirely independent .",
    "however , we have shown ( seymour 2004 , and this work ) that such a model does provide a reasonably good representation of the observed source counts at both 1.4  ghz and 610  mhz .",
    "in a @xmath24.5 hour 610  mhz observation of the 1@xmath56 / @xmath0 survey area , 223 sources are detected down to a 5 @xmath4 detection limit of 300 @xmath3jy within a 32 arcmin radius .",
    "we confirm that the 610  mhz source counts show the upturn in euclidean normalised differential counts below @xmath22  mjy familiar from extensive studies at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the 610  mhz counts are reasonably well fit with a model similar to those fit at 1.4  ghz , assuming a spectral index of @xmath57 for both steep spectrum agn and a population of starburst galaxies undergoing luminosity evolution which dominate below @xmath58 mjy . the best - fitting value for @xmath5 , the power law index of the starburst luminosity evolution , is @xmath54 .",
    "this is consistent with the determinations at 1.4  ghz .",
    "future deeper and wider observations at 610  mhz , will improve our understanding of the source counts at this frequency .",
    "future papers will consider the radio spectral properties of the sub - mjy radio population which , combined with other multi - wavelength agn / starburst discriminators will allow the study of the separate evolution of the two populations .",
    "we note that during the refereeing process , similar 610  mhz catalogues were presented by bondi ( 2006 , astro - ph/0611704 ) and garn ( 2007 , astro - ph/0701534 ) , though neither study models the populations seen at 610  mhz .",
