    "alternatively , we can construct @xmath93 by directly using the double - group representations of @xmath123 contained in the product representation @xmath226 .",

    "@xcite of course , in graphene we would have @xmath246 if the basis functions @xmath128 and @xmath129 were comprised of pure @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) orbitals . however , so coupling induces a mixing of the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath247 ( @xmath248 ) orbitals in graphene that contributes to @xmath240 in second order of so coupling .",
    "@xcite a second contribution to @xmath240 ( linear in so coupling ) stems from an so - induced coupling between the atomic @xmath18 and higher atomic orbitals such as @xmath249 states . @xcite",
    "these mechanisms refer to so matrix elements for states localized on the same atom .",
    "as so coupling originates from the steep gradients of the coulomb potentials in the atomic cores , these terms generally provide the dominant effect , @xcite though we see that such mechanisms are less effective in graphene . a third contribution to @xmath240",
    "is due to the second - nearest - neighbor coupling of the @xmath18 orbitals discussed in ref .  .",
    "recent first - principles calculations @xcite found @xmath250 , with this gap arising almost entirely from contributions from @xmath249 and higher orbitals .",
    "the sign of @xmath240 and , thus , the order of the bands @xmath141 and @xmath235 can not be inferred from our analysis .    unlike the case of inversion - asymmetric crystal structures such as zinc blende and wurtzite , so coupling in inversion - symmetric graphene does not give rise to spin splitting .",
    "hence , with spin taken into account , we get a two - fold spin degeneracy for all bands throughout the brillouin zone .",
