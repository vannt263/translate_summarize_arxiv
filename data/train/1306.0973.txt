    "<S> short - period exoplanets potentially lose envelope masses during their evolution because of atmospheric escape caused by the intense xuv radiation from their host stars . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a combined model of atmospheric mass loss calculation and thermal evolution calculation of a planet to simulate its evolution and explore the dependences on the formation history of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> thermal atmospheric escape as well as the roche - lobe overflow contributes to mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum initial planetary model mass depends primarily on the assumed evolution model of the stellar xuv luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we adapt the model to corot-7b and kepler-10b to explore the evolution of both planets and the maximum initial mass of these planets . </S>",
    "<S> we take the recent x - ray observation of corot-7 into account and exploring the effect of different xuv evolution models on the planetary initial mass . </S>",
