    "this interaction is strong and the linear in momentum relativistic ( dirac ) part of the single particle hamiltonian proportional to the fermi velocity ( @xmath0 ) dominates over a smaller non - relativistic ( schrdinger ) quadratic in momentum piece characterized by a mass ( m ) .",
    "by contrast , in the materials of interest for spintronics , the schrdinger contribution dominates over the weak dirac contribution . in a first approximation",
    ", the same minimal model hamiltonian can be used to describe both cases , but the magnitude of the parameters involved in the dirac and schrdinger contribution are very different .    in presently studied materials ,",
    "the schrdinger mass can vary from the order of the bare electron mass ( @xmath4 ) to one tenth its value and even less . while the fermi velocity @xmath0 is of order @xmath5 m / s in topological insulators , in spintronic materials",
    "it is less than a few times @xmath6 m / s and often much smaller.@xcite this large difference in the magnitude of the spin orbit coupling between these two classes of materials can lead to profound differences in their physical properties .",

    "11 ) means that interband optical transitions are only possible for energies between @xmath132 and @xmath133 but the application of these cut off on momentum in eq . (",
    "10 ) is the only effect of the thermal factors which , at zero temperature , have magnitude of one .",
    "this means that the remaining integral is identical to that for graphene leading to precisely the same absolute value of the universal background .",

    "here the relativistic energy scale given by the dirac term only is @xmath173 while the non relativity magnetic energy scale for @xmath174 is 0.116 mev , two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "secondly the interband optical peaks in @xmath15 remain to very high energies as in the case of graphene previously discussed in ref .",

    "is decreased to @xmath175 a splitting of the peaks in @xmath15 into pairs is seen .",
    "this arises because the schrdinger term breaks the particle hole symmetry of the pure relativistic case and the optical transition @xmath176 to @xmath177 no longer has the same energy as @xmath178 to @xmath179 .",
    "this splitting is even more pronounced when @xmath22 is decreased further to @xmath171 as in the top frame . in this case",
    "not all peaks can be easily identified as split pairs . of course even for @xmath174 , ( third frame down ) there should in principle be a splitting but here we have taken a smearing parameter @xmath170 which is enough to merge them so that a single peak is effectively seen .",

    "consequently the optical spectral weight under an allowed optical transition between ll which must be positive , is in all cases equal to the absolute value of @xmath188 .",

    "nevertheless it shows clearly that the optical spectral weight residing in the various optical lines is changed from the pure dirac case when a subdominant schrdinger piece is also present in the hamiltonian .    in the large @xmath179 limit",

    "is increased over the pure relativistic limit value because of the change in the electronic dispersion curves .",
    "this increase in chemical potential is a direct consequence of the narrowing of the cross - section of the conduction band cone due to the subdominant schrdinger term .",

    "is increased through a decrease in @xmath22 all intraband lines are seen to shift slightly to higher energies as compared to the pure dirac case ( which close to the @xmath174 curves ) .",
    "also the optical spectral weight contained in the intraband line increases as the schrdinger mass is decreased .",

    "differences in @xmath162 remain to high energies and these reflect the small schrdinger admixture which we have added to the hamiltonian .",
    "next we return to the issue of how optical spectral weight gets redistributed between inter and intra band when the chemical potential @xmath1 is varied i.e. a change in doping , without assuming @xmath230 .",
    "we begin with the case of @xmath147 because in that instance , as we have seen , we can get analytic results . in previous sections we showed that the drude weight is given by eq .",

    "the pure relativistic case is unique and special .     to an upper cut off @xmath98 ( in mev ) for four values of chemical potential @xmath236 mev ( solid black curve ) , @xmath237 mev ( dashed green curve ) , @xmath238 mev ( dash - dotted red curve ) and @xmath239 mev ( dotted blue curve ) . in all cases",

    "7 which gives the total spectral weight below @xmath98 ( @xmath162 ) under the real part of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath15 in units of @xmath240mev as a function of @xmath98 in mev .",
    "four cases are shown with @xmath90 tesla , @xmath170 , @xmath222 m/s and the schrdinger mass @xmath171 .",
    "the four values of chemical potential are ( solid black curve ) @xmath236mev , ( dashed green ) @xmath237mev , ( dashed dotted red ) @xmath238mev and ( blue dots ) @xmath239mev . for the first curve",
    "the open circles compare with the @xmath147 case which starts at a finite value at @xmath167 because we have assumed the clean limit and so the intraband transitions contribute a dirac delta function to the frequency dependent conductivity .",
    "@xmath162 then remains completely flat until the onset of the interband transitions set in at @xmath241mev given by eq .",
    "this is quite a lot smaller than the value of @xmath242mev .",
    "the curve for @xmath147 follows well the solid black curve for @xmath243 except of course that in this instance the drude is replaced by the intraband peak and so @xmath162 starts from zero at @xmath167 and becomes equal to the black dots only after all the spectral weight in this line has been picked up . above the interband onset both curves rise linearly with increasing @xmath98 with the slope of this line set by the value of the universal background .",
    "if we extrapolate it to @xmath167 we find that it intercepts the @xmath167 axis at a non zero value given by @xmath244 with  @xmath245 .",
    "for @xmath200 , @xmath246 and this intercept is equal to zero which applies only for the pure relativistic case .",
    "by contrast in topological insulators @xmath247 is not one .",
    "should one know independently the value of the chemical potential one could use the value of the intercept @xmath248 to determine @xmath249 which is a central parameter in assessing the deviations from the pure relativistic case expected in a given topological insulator .",
    "note with reference to the lower frame in fig . 6 that an extrapolation of the near linear region of the black curve for @xmath174 , to @xmath167 will give almost zero intercept and this reflect the fact that in this case the schrdinger correction to pure dirac is small .",
    "returning to the data in fig .",
    "7 , @xmath162 rises to a larger magnitude for the plateau between the saturation of the intraband spectral weight and the threshold for the interband transition as the chemical potential is increased .",
    "this reflects the fact that as @xmath1 increases , more interband lines are lost because of pauli blocking and some of their optical weight is transferred to the intraband line .",
    "the onset of the interband transition beyond the intraband plateau in @xmath162 increases with increasing @xmath1 but the linear rise above this critical photon energy has the same slope in all cases .",
    "the small variations about a straight line seen in this region reflect of course the underlying landau level structure which is smeared almost completely by the broadening @xmath170 . at higher energies",
    "all the curves become parallel to each other but are displaced upward as @xmath1 is increased . in graphene , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ 17 ] , the curves would all merge in this region in contrast to what we find here for topological insulators when the value of the subdominant schrdinger part to the hamiltonian is significant .",
    "it is the value of the intercept with the verticle axis of the straight line variation at large energies which sets the displacement between these parallel lines and as we have seen graphene corresponds to the limit of zero intercept .",
    "we have calculated the absorptive part of both longitudinal and transverse ( hall ) ac dynamic magneto conductivity for quadratic electronic bands modified by a small spin orbit coupling .",
    "this provides a mechanism for interband optical transitions between the split helical bands .",
    "these optical transitions are additional to the main intraband ( drude ) absorption which is the only process possible when the spin - orbit coupling is not present .",
    "we find that for the rather small values of fermi velocity representative of the semiconductors presently used in spintronic applications , the interband absorption is small and that this background is likely not to be seen as distinct from the main drude intraband absorption .",
    "however as the fermi velocity @xmath0 is increased a distinct interband background emerges which takes on the same universal values of @xmath158 as observed in grahene except for a degeneracy factor of 4 not applicable in this case .",
    "the universal background however is confined to a definite very limited range of photon energies with upper and lower cut off dependent on the value of the chemical potential and also on the magnitude of the magnetic field when @xmath17 is also present .",
    "comparison of these results with those obtained in the opposite limit , when instead the schrdinger term is a small perturbation on a dominant spin orbit term , provides new insight into the case of topological insulators .",
    "there , the interband transitions are much more prominent , extend to large energies and are cut off only by the band edge . for no magnetic field ( @xmath147 )",
    "we were able to obtain analytic results which are valid for any value of @xmath22 and @xmath0 and these confirmed aspects of our finite @xmath17 results .",
    "we showed that the interband background contains a total optical spectral weight of @xmath250 which is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this spectral weight is small when either @xmath22 or @xmath0 is small and it is large when both @xmath22 and @xmath0 are large as in topological insulators . in particular for @xmath140 we recover the known result for graphene where only the dirac contribution is present , and the interband transitions extend to the band cut off .",
    "when the chemical potential @xmath1 is increased , a well known result for graphene is that all the optical spectral weight lost in the interband transitions is found transferred to the intraband transitions .",
    "this conservation of spectral weight no longer applies when a subdominant schrdinger piece is added to a pure dirac hamiltonian . while these violations are small for typical parameters associated with present day known topological insulators , measuring them allows one to determine the critical parameter @xmath249 which provides the information on the expected deviations of optical properties from the pure dirac case . in the spintronic limit",
    "we find that the amount of spectral weight in the interband background is almost fixed while at the same time the intraband contribution increase with increasing chemical potential .",
