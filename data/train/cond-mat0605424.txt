    "d_-wave materials @xcite , and even the possibility for impurity localization of quasiparticles was discussed @xcite .",
    "traditionally , such effects were treated using certain forms of single - impurity approximation , as t - matrix approximation @xcite or its generalization to the self - consistent t - matrix approximation ( sctma ) @xcite .",
    "then , within the sctma scope , a finite limiting value of dos , @xmath28 , was predicted either in the born limit , @xmath29 @xcite , and in the unitary limit , @xmath30 @xcite , for impurity perturbation @xmath5 .",
    "however it was shown later that , for a properly defined sctma solution , @xmath31 should vanish ( at any finite @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "the issue of finite or zero limit for dos is of crucial importance for low temperature physics of real high-@xmath14 systems .",
    "thus , supposing existence of @xmath32 , p.a .",
    "lee arrived at the prediction that the quasiparticle electric a.c .",
    "conductivity @xmath33 in the static limit @xmath34 should tend to a _ universal _",
    "value @xmath35 @xcite , independent of impurity parameters at all !",
    "similarly , a universal limit was predicted for the ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature , @xmath36(\\b^{-1 } + \\b)$ ] @xcite ( where @xmath37 is the number of conducting planes per unit cell and @xmath38 the distance between them ) .",
    "but no such behavior would be possible for the above referred alternative of vanishing dos at @xmath39 .",
    "this alternative was predicted in various analytical forms : sublinear @xmath40 with @xmath41 @xcite ( also concluded from numerical solution of bogolyubov - de gennes equations @xcite ) , linear @xmath42 ( for non - magnetic impurities ) @xcite , or superlinear @xmath43 ( for magnetic impurities ) @xcite and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "it should be also mentioned that some field theory approaches to this problem even resulted in diverging dos : @xmath45 $ ] @xcite or @xmath46/|\\e|$ ] @xcite .",
    "up to the moment , the experimental checks for universal behavior in the low - frequency electric transport @xcite and low - temperature heat transport @xcite do not provided a definitive support for any of these scenarios .",
    "it is important to notice that either the sctma approach of refs . @xcite and the field - theory models of refs .",
    "@xcite are only justified if the relevant quasiparticle states are extended ( non - localized ) .",
    "this requires that a quasiparticle with wavevector @xmath18 have the mean free path @xmath47 longer than its wavelength @xmath48 , as expressed by the known ioffe - regel - mott ( irm ) criterion @xcite .",
    "also the derivation of the above mentioned universal limits fully relies on the kubo formula integrals over the _ extended _ states ( involving a certain lifetime @xmath49 for given quasiparticle velocity @xmath50 ) .",
    "but in presence of _ localized _ states , the concepts of mean free path and lifetime do not make sense for them , and the kubo formula should be reconsidered for the corresponding range of the spectrum , e.g. , as for hopping transport in semiconductors @xcite . fortunately , the analysis of dos can be done independently from the controversial issue of universal conductivity ( postponing it for more detailed future treatment ) .",
    "as to the limiting dos values , it was shown @xcite that the sctma approach in fact admits two solutions .",
    "one of them , called sctma-1 , leads to finite @xmath51 as given in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the other solution , sctma-2 , yields in vanishing @xmath52 .",
    "and only sctma-2 proves to satisfy the irm criterion at @xmath53 , thus appearing as the only valid sctma solution in this limit . applying the same check to the power law solutions @xmath40 ,",
    "one finds them to satisfy the irm criterion only if @xmath54 , which is not actually the case in refs . @xcite and @xcite ( for non - magnetic impurities ) .",
    "thus , it could be thought that the ambiguity is resolved in favor of the superlinearly vanishing sctma-2 dos .",
    "however the sctma ( or field - theoretical ) analysis can not be considered fully comprehensive for the real quasiparticle spectrum in a disordered system , if the localized states are also admitted .",
    "a more complete description is possible , noting that the sctma self - energy is only the first term of the so - called group expansion ( ge ) @xcite , where this term describes all the processes of quasiparticle scattering on _ isolated _ impurities . in accordance with the above irm check",
    ", such processes can not produce localized states near zero energy .",
    "but if the sctma contribution to dos vanishes in this limit , the importance can pass to the next terms of ge , related to scattering ( and possible localization ) of quasiparticles on random groups ( clusters ) of impurities .",
    "the essential point is that their contribution to dos is mostly defined by the _",
    "real _ parts of green functions which do not need self - consistency corrections and thus remain valid for the energy range of localized states ( where the irm criterion does not hold ) .",
    "the known approaches to impurity cluster effects in disordered _ d_-wave superconductors , either numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite , were contradictory about dos and did not conclude definitely on localization .",
    "a practical analysis of such effects within the ge framework for an _",
    "s_-wave superconductor was proposed recently @xcite , using a special algebraic technique in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "the present work develops a similar technique for a disordered _ d_-wave system in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "we shall consider two main types of impurities , non - magnetic ( nm ) and magnetic ( m ) , and show that only m - impurities can provide a finite ( but different from the sctma-1 value ) dos , replacing the sctma-2 solution in a narrow vicinity of the ( shifted ) nodal energy and manifesting onset of localization there .",
    "the latter should produce , instead of universal conductivity , its exponential suppression at sufficiently low temperatures .",

    "in the energy spectrum of a crystal with impurities , one can distinguish certain intervals where dos is dominated by contributions from band - like states , single impurities , impurity pairs , triples , etc . @xcite .",
    "then , for instance , in the pair - dominated energy interval , each discrete peak ( by an impurity pair at given separation @xmath70 in the lattice ) experiences small shifts , due to the effects by neighbor impurities of such a pair , different in different parts of the system .",

    "<S> the long disputed issue of the limiting value of quasiparticle density of states @xmath0 in a _ _ d-__wave superconductor with impurities ( _ vs _ its linear vanishing , @xmath1 , near the nodal point @xmath2 in a pure system with the gap parameter @xmath3 ) is discussed . using the technique of group expansions of green functions in complexes of interacting impurities , it is shown that finite @xmath4 value is possible if the ( finite ) impurity perturbation @xmath5 is spin - dependent ( magnetic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the found value has a power law dependence on the impurity concentration @xmath6 : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the normal metal density of states and @xmath9 is the least number of impurities in a complex that can localize nodal quasiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> this result essentially differs from the known predictions of self - consistent approximation : @xmath10 ( for the unitary limit @xmath11 ) or @xmath12 ( for the born limit @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we predict also existence of a narrow interval ( mobility gap ) around the fermi energy , where all the states are localized on proper impurity clusters , leading to exponential suppression of low - temperature kinetics .    </S>",
