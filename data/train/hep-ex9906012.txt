    "the experiments carried out in the last 15 years at petra , pep , tristan and recently also at lep and hera have shown convincingly that due to strong interactions the real photon has a nontrivial hadron  like structure . in these experiments",
    "incoming electrons or positrons acted as a source of virtual photons which were subsequently involved in hard collisions with partons from another photon or proton .",
    "most of these studies concerned the region of very small photon virtualities @xmath3 ( typically @xmath4  called photoproduction ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath3 the situation changes as photon has less time to develop its hadronic structure .",
    "the way the photon structure varies with @xmath3 holds important information on the interplay between perturbative and non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "contrary to @xmath5 colliders which are sensitive via deep inelastic @xmath6 scattering to the quark structure of the real photon , jet production at the @xmath0 collider hera is sensitive both to gluon and quark structure of photon .",
    "moreover the jet cross section at hera is large enough to allow us to investigate the structure not only of real @xmath7 but also of virtual photon ( @xmath8 in this paper ) .",
    "all results reported here were obtained in @xmath9 collisions at energies ( 27.6 + 820 ) gev .",
    "the dijet cross section in @xmath0 collisions at hera is sensitive to the gluon content of photon especially at lower @xmath11 .",
    "is the fraction of photon momentum carried by parton . ] to reach @xmath11 as low as 0.04 the inelasticity of the reaction was restricted to @xmath12 in photoproduction data of integrated luminosity @xmath13 .",
    "jets were obtained by the cdf cone algorithm with @xmath14 and accepted in the pseudorapidity range @xmath15 in laboratory frame .",
    "axis of the coordinate system points in the direction of incoming proton . ] the cross section @xmath16 from events with at least two jets with @xmath17 after pedestal subtraction and @xmath18 was corrected for detector inefficiencies using phojet and pythia .    to obtain the gluon density of the photon the dijet cross section",
    "was further unfolded to parton level using dagostini s program @xcite .",
    "the largest systematic error in the resulting effective parton density    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are the quark , antiquark and gluon densities in the photon , comes from the hadronic @xmath21 scale uncertainty and different treatment of soft parton interactions used in phojet and pythia .",
    "the both dominate at low @xmath11 .",
    "the measured effective parton density is almost independent of the hard scale defined by the @xmath2 of the partons .",
    "the gluon density is obtained from the effective parton density subtracting quark densities as given by the grv  lo parametrisation .",
    "the result of @xcite is shown in fig  [ fig : oliver ] together with the h1 analysis of high @xmath2 inclusive tracks @xcite .",
    "both measurements are consistent with the increase of gluon density in real photon at low @xmath22 .",
    "note that the high @xmath2 inclusive track and the jet analyses are subject to different detector systematics .",
    "the growth of @xmath23 at low @xmath11 agrees with the grv  lo parametrisation .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to investigate the evolution of the effective parton density ( 1 ) with @xmath3 and with the hard scale @xmath25 .",
    "jets were found using the inclusive @xmath26 algorithm .",
    "events were accepted if the two highest @xmath27 jets in the event were in the backward hemisphere of the @xmath28 cms frame with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are jet rapidities and @xmath31 their average .",
    "the constraints on jet @xmath27 were such that no jet has @xmath32 gev and the sum of jet @xmath27 s is always @xmath33 gev .",
    "the inelasticity of reaction was restricted to @xmath34 and virtuality of @xmath24 to @xmath35 .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the data sample is @xmath36 .",
    "the triple - differential jet cross section @xmath37 was measured @xcite , where @xmath38 is the mean transverse energy of the two highest @xmath27 jets . from the cross section a leading order effective parton density as a function of @xmath39",
    "was extracted . for unfolding @xcite",
    "the correlation matrix was used based on herwig and rapgap monte carlo samples .",
    "the largest systematic error @xmath40 in the parton density arises from model dependence ( hadronization uncertainty ) .",
    "the effective parton density was extracted in the kinematic range of @xmath41 and @xmath42 in bins of @xmath43 and @xmath11 with limitation @xmath44 .",
    "the parton density is approximately independent of @xmath45 , and within errors , it is consistent with the normalisation and logarithmic scaling violations characteristic of the photon structure .",
    "the logarithmic suppression with increasing @xmath3 as predicted by virtual photon structure gives a good description below @xmath46 ( fig  [ fig : tania ] ) .",
    "comparison with a @xmath47 pole model shows that the nonperturbative vdm component plays significant role only in the parton density of the real photon .",
    "when only a fraction of the photon momentum is involved in the hard collision then the remaining momentum is carried away by spectator partons .",
    "these partons fragment into a photon remnant which is expected to be approximately collinear with the original photon .",
    "there are at least two possible ways to study the properties of the photon remnant .",
    "one is to treat it as an energy deposit close to the direction of the photon , the other to find it as a low @xmath2 jet by jet algorithms . in the analysis @xcite the @xmath48 of photon remnant",
    "was measured as a function of the photon virtuality @xmath49 and @xmath50 gev of two jets using the deco @xcite jet algorithm .",
    "jets are accepted in pseudorapidity range of @xmath51 in @xmath28 cms and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 distribution @xcite of the photon remnant corrected for detector effects agrees better with herwig than rapgap models .",
    "the intrinsic momentum @xmath54 of the parton coming to the hard process is taken as gaussian with @xmath55 gev to describe relatively high @xmath56 gev observed in data .",
    "it was found that hadronization effects contribute @xmath57 gev to this value but do not change the @xmath53 dependence .",
    "fig  [ fig : alice ] shows the dependence of average @xmath58 of the photon remnant on the hard scale given by @xmath2 of jets .",
    "comparison of photoproduction ( @xmath59 ) and low @xmath3 ( @xmath60 ) data shows no significant dependence on the photon virtuality . on the other hand @xmath48 of the photon remnant",
    "is correlated with the hard scale of the process  it increases with @xmath2 of jets .",
    "for the virtual photon with @xmath61 the concept of photon structure is in principal not needed since a part of its effects is included in nlo diagrams .",
    "therefore the question arises whether in nlo the photon structure function is still needed for the description of data . to answer this question",
    "the dijet cross section was compared with nlo calculation of jetvip @xcite .",
    "jets were obtained by the cdf cone algorithm applied to data of integral luminosity of @xmath62 in the range @xmath60 .",
    "two jets with the highest @xmath27 had to fulfil conditions @xmath63 gev in the pseudorapidity range @xmath64 in the @xmath24p cms .    the @xmath65 distribution of inclusive dijet production in four @xmath3 bins is given in fig  [ fig : nlo ] @xcite .",
    "the data are corrected for detector inefficiencies .",
    "the curves represent nlo calculation by jetvip .",
    "the dashed line represents the contribution from unsubtracted nlo direct processes ( no structure function of the virtual photon  for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the full line corresponds to the full nlo calculation including also diagrams from resolved processes with grv - ho parton distribution functions .",
    "we see that for @xmath66 and @xmath67 the unsubtracted direct nlo calculation is systematically below the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the full nlo calculation ( solid curve ) is in a reasonable agreement with data in all four @xmath3 bins .",
    "since hadronization corrections are not included in the nlo parton level calculation , deviations from the measured cross section are expected .",
    "estimates show that they increase significantly at @xmath68 being at the level of @xmath69 at larger pseudorapidity .",
