    "transition to turbulence in cylindrical pipe flow is governed by one single dimensionless parameter , the reynolds number @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean flow speed along the pipe , @xmath3 the pipe diameter and @xmath4 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ( reynolds 1883 ) . despite the simplicity of the set - up",
    ", the reason for transition remains obscure due to the linear stability of the laminar hagen - poiseuille flow ( hagen 1839 , poiseuille 1840 ) and the sensitivity of the process to the exact shape and amplitude of disturbances present .",
    "in most experiments , transition is observed at @xmath5 ( e.g. wygnanski & champagne 1973 ) but can be triggered as low as @xmath6 ( peixinho & mullin 2006 ) or delayed to @xmath7 in very carefully controlled experiments ( pfenniger 1961 ) . until recently , the only firm theoretical result was the energy stability bound of @xmath8 ( joseph & carmi , 1969 ) below which _ all _ disturbances are guaranteed to decay monotonically .",
    "this is , however , more than an order of magnitude below the observed value for transition .    an important step forward in understanding the transition process was the discovery of disconnected solutions to the navier - stokes equations in a cylindrical pipe ( faisst & eckhardt 2003 , wedin & kerswell 2004 , kerswell 2005 , pringle & kerswell 2007 ) .",
    "these exact solutions are travelling waves ( tws ) which appear through saddle - node bifurcations as in other shear flows ( nagata 1990 , waleffe 1997,1998,2001,2003 ) .",
    "all these solutions are linearly unstable though they have a very low - dimensional unstable manifold .",
    "there is much interest in these solutions , as very similar structures have been observed transiently in experiments ( hof et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) and direct numerical simulations ( kerswell & tutty 2007 , schneider _ et al .",
    "_ 2007a , willis & kerswell 2008a ) .",
    "these states can generally be divided into ` upper - branch ' and ` lower - branch ' tws , based on whether they have high or low wall shear stress .",
    "lower branch solutions are believed to sit on a hypersurface that divides phase space into two regions : one where initial points lead directly to the laminar state , the other where initial conditions lead to turbulent episodes ( kawahara 2005 , wang _ et .",
    "_ 2007 , kerswell & tutty 2007 , viswanath 2008 ) .",
    "the simple translational behaviour of these travelling wave solutions is inherent to the method used to find them , and undoubtedly masks an even larger variety of more complex exact solutions .",
    "the boundary between laminar and turbulent trajectories - labelled @xmath0 hereafter - is formally a separatrix if the turbulent state is an attractor . at low @xmath9 , however , turbulence may ultimately decay after a long transient in which case the laminar state is the unique global attractor .",
    "then the boundary @xmath0 is generalised to the dividing set in phase space between trajectories which smoothly relaminarise and those which do undergo a turbulent evolution .",
    "@xmath0 is thought to be of codimension 1 in phase space but one can _ a priori _ not exclude a more complex fractal structure , as suggested by the dependence of lifetime on initial conditions in simulations of pipe flow ( faisst & eckhardt 2004 ) . trajectories which start in @xmath0 - hereafter called the ` edge ' following skufca et al .",
    "( 2006 ) - stay in @xmath0 for later times by definition and hence the long time dynamics are of obvious interest .",
    "the long time behaviour on @xmath0 has already been found to be a periodic solution in plane poiseuille flow in a pioneering study by toh & itano ( 1999 , see also itano & toh 2001 ) .",
    "skufca et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied a 9-dimensional model of plane couette flow ( pcf ) to reveal an attracting periodic orbit at low @xmath9 and an apparently chaotic state at higher @xmath9 .",
    "however , recent fully - resolved simulations have shown that the asymptotic behaviour is an attracting tw in pcf ( schneider et al .",
    "2008 , viswanath 2008 ) and a chaotic attractor in a short cylindrical pipe of length @xmath10 ( schneider et al .",
    "interestingly , this seemingly chaotic end state looks to be centered around an ` asymmetric ' tw ( pringle & kerswell 2007 , mellibovsky & meseguer 2007 ) . + the purpose of this paper is to explore the dividing hypersurface @xmath0 in pipe flow with the following objectives :    1 .   to establish that the dynamics restricted to this laminar - turbulent boundary explores many different saddle points embedded in it ; 2 .   to find evidence for heteroclinic or ` relative ' homoclinic connections between these saddle points ; 3 .",
    "to explore @xmath0 restricted by a discrete rotational symmetry in order to ascertain whether the limiting behaviour remains chaotic or can be a simple attractor ; 4 .   to develop a practical and general way to find tws and periodic orbits without detailed knowledge of their spatial structure .",
    "+    the works cited above employ a reduced computational domain for their calculations , imposing short - wavelength periodicity in one direction ( along the pipe , schneider et al .",
    "2007b ) or two ( in the spanwise and streamwise directions in plane couette flow , schneider et al . 2008 , viswanath 2008 ) .",
    "this is very much in the spirit of the minimal flow unit pioneered by jimenez & moin ( 1991 ) and used with considerable success to identify key mechanisms underpinning turbulence ( hamilton et al . 1995 ) . in this paper",
    ", we also adopt this same approach by concentrating on pipes up to @xmath11 long .",
    "the ensuing reduction in the degrees of freedom of the flow allows a much more detailed exploration of the flow dynamics albeit restricted to a subspace of strict spatial periodicity .",
    "this is a necessary preliminary to motivate a more carefully focussed study in much longer pipes which can capture spatially - localised turbulent structures ( e.g. priymak & miyazaki 2004 , willis & kerswell 2007 , 2008a ) but at considerable numerical cost still .",
    "flow structures found in the short pipes considered here also exist , of course , in a longer pipe but will be more unstable due to the greater degrees of freedom present there .",
    "it is also worth remarking that a recent study ( nikitin 2007 ) has shown how pipe flow is slow to lose its spatial periodicity when this is restriction is lifted .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the formulation and numerical methods used to simulate the flow in a pipe and to extract exact recurrent flow solutions .",
    "section 3 presents the results obtained using these in 7 subsections .",
    "subsection 3.1 recalls the method used to follow trajectories on @xmath0 and confirms that the limiting behaviour looks chaotic ( schneider et al .",
    "sections 3.2 and 3.3 discuss how near - recurrent states are identified and using a newton - krylov algorithm demonstrate that a number of unstable travelling waves are approached .",
    "subsection 3.4 offers evidence for the existence of a ` relative ' homoclinic connection between a travelling wave and the same wave rotated .",
    "subsection 3.5 looks for recurrent flow structures in @xmath0 restricted by a discrete rotational symmetry and identifies new exact travelling wave solutions .",
    "subsection 3.6 shows that within this subspace the limiting state of @xmath0 is a simple attractor .",
    "subsection 3.7 confirms that all the tws found in the earlier subsections are indeed embedded in the laminar - turbulent boundary .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion in section 4 .",
    "we consider the incompressible flow of newtonian fluid in a cylindrical pipe and adopt the usual set of cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 and velocity components @xmath13 . the domain considered here is @xmath14\\times[0\\!:\\!2\\pi]\\times[0\\!:\\!l]$ ] , where @xmath15 is the length of the pipe and lengths are in units of radii ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the flow is described by the incompressible three - dimensional navier - stokes equations @xmath17 the flow is driven by a constant mass - flux condition , as in recent experiments ( e.g. peixinho & mullin 2006 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodicity across the pipe length @xmath18 and no - slip on the walls @xmath19 .",
    "the basic tool for the numerical determination of exact recurrent states is the accurate time - stepping code used by willis & kerswell ( 2007,2008a ) .",
    "the velocity field is derived from two scalar potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 and the incompressible navier - stokes equations are re - written using the formulation introduced by marqus ( 1990 ) .",
    "the two scalar potentials are discretised using high - order finite differences in the radial direction @xmath23 and spectral fourier expansions in the azimuthal direction @xmath24 and axial direction @xmath25 .",
    "for example , the decomposition of the scalar potential @xmath21 at a radial location @xmath26 , @xmath27 , reads @xmath28 the positive integer @xmath29 refers to the discrete rotational symmetry @xmath30 of the flow ( trivially @xmath31 means no rotational symmetry is imposed ) .",
    "the resolution of a given calculation is described by a vector @xmath32 .",
    "it is adjusted until the energy in the spectral coefficients drops by at least 5 and usually 6 decades from lowest to highest - order modes .",
    "the time stepping is 2nd order accurate with @xmath33 updated using an adaptive method based on a cfl condition .",
    "the number of ( real ) degrees of freedom , which defines the dimension of phase - space , is @xmath34 .",
    "the set of all complex coefficients @xmath35 defines our phase - space with its usual euclidean norm @xmath36 .",
    "symmetries exhibited by tws such as the shift - and - reflect symmetry @xmath37 and the mirror symmetry ( e.g. pringle & kerswell 2007 , pringle et al .",
    "2008 ) @xmath38 are not imposed in the simulations .",
    "the spectral expansion defined above converts the navier - stokes equations into an autonomous dynamical system of the form @xmath39 travelling wave solutions are ` relative equilibrium ' solutions of the navier - stokes , steady in an appropriate galilean frame .",
    "it is numerically convenient to seek and interpret them as a special case of  relative periodic orbit \" ( rpo ) ( viswanath 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "we hence developed an algorithm to look for rpos defined as zeros of the functional @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the point at time @xmath42 on the trajectory starting at time @xmath43 from the point @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the point in phase space corresponding to the state @xmath46 shifted back in space by the distance @xmath47 in the axial direction and by the angle @xmath48 in the azimuthal direction .",
    "a shift by @xmath49 corresponds in phase - space to the transformation @xmath50 a zero of @xmath51 corresponds to a flow repeating itself exactly after a time t , but at a different location defined by @xmath47 and @xmath52 .",
    "a travelling wave solution is a rpo where there is a degeneracy between the shifts @xmath47 and @xmath52 , and the period @xmath42 .",
    "for the case of a tw propagating axially with speed @xmath53 , @xmath54 , where @xmath42 is an apparent period . to remove this degeneracy , we impose @xmath55 unless otherwise specified .",
    "as the majority of known tws do not rotate , @xmath56 is also assumed ( those that do rotate do so rather slowly , pringle & kerswell , 2007 ) .",
    "starting from a good initial guess for @xmath44 and an estimate of the period @xmath42 ( to be discussed in section [ sec : rec ] ) , we minimise the residual @xmath51 using a newton - krylov algorithm , based on a gmres algorithm ( saad & schultz , 1986 ) . the size of the dynamical system ( typically @xmath57 degrees of freedom ) necessitates the use of a matrix - free formulation .",
    "the use of an _ inexact _ krylov solver also leads to a significant gain in computation time ( we used the choice 2 in eisenstat & walker , 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , we embed the newton solver into a more globally convergent strategy in order to improve likeliness of convergence , using a double dogleg step technique ( dennis & schnabel , 1995 , brown & saad 1990 ) . for the special case of tws with a short period ,",
    "we assume full convergence when the normalised residual @xmath58 is less than @xmath59 .",
    "once a travelling wave solution is known , along with its axial propagation speed @xmath53 , it can be expressed as a steady solution in the frame moving at speed @xmath53 . in this galilean frame",
    ", the stability of the solutions can be studied numerically using an eigenvalue solver based on an arnoldi algorithm .",
    "this yields the leading eigenvalues whose real part , when positive , indicates the growth rate of infinitesimal perturbations to the exact solution in the moving frame .",
    "we present 4 ` edge ' calculations , each motivated by a different question . in the first ( see  [ sec : edge]-3 ) , the edge in a pipe length @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is calculated starting from a typical turbulent initial condition in order to investigate whether there are coherent structures buried in it .",
    "we are able to confirm the presence of what looks to be a chaotic attractor as found recently by schneider et .",
    "al . ( 2007b ) . in the second edge calculation (  [ sec : heteroc ] ) we look for numerical evidence of heteroclinic connections between saddle points by using a perturbed tw as an initial condition . in the third (  [ sec : m_02 ] ) we impose the discrete rotational symmetry @xmath62 on the flow to exploit the saddle structure of the subset of @xmath0 to reveal new tws which possess @xmath62-symmetry . in the fourth (  [ sec : attractor ] ) we look for evidence of multiple attracting tws to demonstrate that under a rotational symmetry constraint the large - time dynamics need not be chaotic .      in this subsection we choose a pipe with @xmath61 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 , set @xmath31 so that there is no restriction on the rotational symmetry , and take a numerical resolution of @xmath65 . for this value of @xmath9 , turbulence , when triggered , is sustained over the typical simulation time which is much longer that the time taken to relaminarise . in order to constrain a numerical trajectory to stay on the edge surface , @xmath0",
    ", we use a shooting method analogous to that first used in plane couette flow by toh & itano ( 1999 ) .",
    "we first produce a long turbulent trajectory and pick a state @xmath66 of relatively low three - dimensional disturbance energy @xmath67 ( defined as the kinetic energy in the streamwise - dependent fourier modes @xmath68 ) . initial states are then chosen from the line , @xmath69 parameterised by the real number @xmath70 and @xmath71 is an axial average .",
    "the initial condition @xmath72 is two - dimensional and hence does not trigger turbulence , whereas @xmath73 is the original turbulent state .",
    "this @xmath70-interval is then repeatedly halved with , at each stage , the new interval selected such that an initial condition corresponding to @xmath70 at the lower limit relaminarises , whereas that at the upper limit leads to large turbulent values of @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath70 is refined close to machine accuracy using double precision arithmetic , forcing the energy of the trajectory to stay at an intermediate level corresponding to the laminar - turbulent boundary for typical times of @xmath75 . at the values of @xmath9",
    "used here , the energy of this boundary is clearly distinct from those associated with turbulence and thus makes determination of @xmath70 unambiguous .",
    "once machine precision has been reached , the process is restarted from nearby states towards the end of the trajectory originating from neighbouring @xmath70 values .    the full trajectory , of duration @xmath76 ,",
    "does not show any sign of convergence towards a simple state but rather displays erratic and unpredictable dynamics , as found by schneider et al ( 2007b ) .",
    "we deliberately avoid the word ` turbulent ' as this refers to larger values of @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ e1 ] shows the time evolution of the @xmath67 .      despite the lack of regularity of the energy signals , inspection of all velocity components at several random locations in the pipe",
    "indicate clearly that the flow on @xmath0 is sometimes nearly periodic in time on short intervals . for the case",
    "@xmath77 , it is possible by eye to identify several temporal windows where all velocity components approximately oscillate with a given frequency ( see figure [ velz ] ) . within these windows",
    "the dynamics on the edge appear to be temporally correlated with a short period .",
    "a large number of snapshots were taken at times @xmath78 across the whole trajectory . to investigate the possibility of recurrence in the flow , each snapshot state @xmath79",
    "was used as an initial condition for time - stepping . the normalised distance in phase space between this initial point and its evolution in time was then examined for local minima .",
    "specifically , we define the scalar residual function @xmath80 where @xmath47 is a distance by which the state @xmath81 is shifted back in @xmath25 for comparison .",
    "we chose @xmath55 so that a value of @xmath82 for some @xmath83 means that the flow in the pipe is _ exactly _ the flow at time @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", @xmath79 lies on a periodic orbit of the system with the time interval @xmath85 being a multiple of the period ( for @xmath86 , a vanishing residual would indicate a _ relative _ periodic orbit ) .",
    "for the ease of calculation , most of the time we chose to neglect the possibility of recurrence occurring after a shift in the azimuthal direction @xmath24 , and therefore @xmath87 was imposed .",
    "typical plots of @xmath88 starting from different values of @xmath84 are displayed in figure [ res1 ] .",
    "every function @xmath89 attains a smallest local minimum which is defined as @xmath90 figure [ rmin1 ] shows how @xmath91 varies with the starting point .",
    "phases for which @xmath91 is small ( from experience below @xmath92 ) may be interpreted as approximate approaches to periodic orbits of the system by the edge trajectory .",
    "the alternating pattern of maxima and minima in @xmath91 is then the signature of a repellor - a set of states which attract trajectories before ultimately repelling them away . for hyperbolic dynamical systems ,",
    "trajectories are attracted towards one of these states along their stable manifold and ejected away along their unstable manifold ( see the sketch in figure [ phasespace ] ) .",
    "for the parameters here , 6 dips in the @xmath91-profile are suggestive of 6 approaches , denoted respectively by @xmath93 .",
    "parts of the trajectory linking one state to the next ( e.g. @xmath94 or @xmath95 ) may be located in the vicinity of heteroclinic connections between the two states , should such a connection exist , or a relative homoclinic connection for two successive states which are the same but for a shift .",
    "the notion of ` vicinity ' depends on the choice of the norm in phase space . here",
    ", a pragmatic approach is adopted : we use the expression ` @xmath46 is close to a periodic orbit @xmath96 ' to mean that the newton - krylov algorithm converges to the periodic orbit @xmath96 starting with the initial guess @xmath46 .",
    "we now analyse the neighbourhood of the points @xmath79 yielding a low value of @xmath91 looking for exact recurrent states for which @xmath91 exactly vanishes . starting from such initial guesses ,",
    "the newton - krylov algorithm defined in  [ sec : newton ] was used to further minimise @xmath91 .",
    "of the six different starting guesses a to f introduced in the previous subsection , excellent convergence was obtained in the cases @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , with @xmath91 being reduced down to @xmath101 .",
    "the converged states are labelled respectively @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 in order to distinguish them from the starting points @xmath106 , and to indicate the parameter @xmath107 .",
    "the cases @xmath108 and @xmath109 displayed only partial convergence to respectively @xmath110 and @xmath111 and it is not possible to say if there really are zeros of @xmath91 in this neighbourhood . despite ` globalisation ' improvements to the newton - krylov algorithm to improve convergence , sample starting guesses away from the candidates @xmath112 failed to converge .",
    "the converged states @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 all correspond to travelling wave solutions .",
    "close inspection of their spatial structure and dynamics shows that they are , in fact , the _ same _ travelling wave solution modulo a shift in the azimuthal direction : see figure [ plots1 ] .",
    "this state corresponds exactly to the ` asymmetric ' tw identified in pringle & kerswell ( 2007 ) whose @xmath25-averaged velocity field is strongly reminiscent of the chaotic state calculated by schneider et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "this resemblance has also been noted by mellibovsky & meseguer ( 2007 ) who used a different approach to infer the significance of this same asymmetric tw .",
    "interestingly , the present study at these parameter values did not find evidence of states with higher rotational symmetry in spite of the fact that such tws are known to be embedded in the edge ( see fig .",
    "4 of kerswell & tutty , 2007 ) .",
    "the search for recurrent states described above was initially undertaken with @xmath56 disallowing azimuthal propagation of the recurrent patterns . in the case",
    "@xmath97 , we experimented with allowing @xmath52 to be updated by the newton - raphson scheme .",
    "this involved solving an additional equation @xmath113 ( viswanath 2007 ) . using newton - krylov with the same starting guess @xmath97 but allowing the shift @xmath52 to be updated , produced convergence to another state @xmath114 which is distinct from @xmath102 .",
    "this state , despite a velocity profile very analogous to that of @xmath102 , rotates by an angle @xmath115 degrees after travelling one pipe length .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the bifurcation diagram obtained by pringle & kerswell ( 2007 ) for the asymmetric tw ( though here @xmath9 is much higher ) : for a given reynolds number , a branch of solutions with helicity is connected to the mirror - symmetric branch , and intersects the non - helical subspace twice .",
    "the solutions at the crossing points are non - helical but nevertheless possess a rotational propagation speed @xmath116 , like our solution @xmath114 .",
    "the fact that such a solution has been found here could be explained by the fact that the numerical code used does not allow helicity , hence the newton - krylov algorithm has no choice but to look for the intersection of the helical branch with a non - helical subspace .",
    "however , other attempts to find exact recurrent patterns with rotation invariably converged back to a non - rotating ( @xmath56 ) tw .",
    "the results so far indicate the possible existence of heteroclinic trajectories linking the exact states found . when the two consecutively visited states are the same modulo a shift in the azimuthal direction ,  relative \" homoclinic connection is a more appropriate term . in an attempt to find further evidence for such connections , a series of initial conditions sampling the unstable manifold of a tw were explored . the asymmetric travelling wave of pringle & kerswell ( 2007 ) was chosen ( i.e. @xmath102 ) with the parameters @xmath77 and orientated so that it was @xmath117-symmetric about the @xmath118 plane . in the corresponding @xmath117-symmetric subspace",
    ", the solution has exactly two unstable eigendirections , denoted by @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath119 being the most unstable one ( there are no unstable directions in the dual space of @xmath117-_anti_symmetric perturbations ) .",
    "these two vectors were normalised to have unit energy and an initial condition was defined as @xmath121 here , @xmath122 is a positive parameter chosen small enough that @xmath44 is effectively in the unstable manifold of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 suffices ) .",
    "the angle @xmath125 defines a plane spanned by @xmath119 and @xmath120 and vanishes in the direction of @xmath119 . for some values of the angle @xmath125 ,",
    "the trajectory starting at @xmath126 returns to the laminar state whereas for others , it becomes turbulent .",
    "boundary values of @xmath125 between these two behaviours lead to intermediate dynamics demonstrating that @xmath127 sits on the edge @xmath0 . in all cases",
    "the trajectory starts in the @xmath117-symmetric subspace , but after a finite time this symmetry is broken by numerical noise .",
    "a bisection method is used to determine ( to machine precision ) an angle @xmath125 for which the trajectory neither evolves to the laminar or turbulent state ( see figure [ heteroplot ] for a sketch of the method ) . the energy contained in the axially - dependent modes",
    "is displayed in figure [ e4 ] and the residual function @xmath128 in figure [ rmin4 ] . these show that @xmath91 increases exponentially but the energy changes little until @xmath129 .",
    "after this linear regime , @xmath91 continues to increase , then drops to a local minimum value of @xmath130 at @xmath131 before increasing again .",
    "when the state at the local minimum ( b4 in figure [ rmin4 ] ) was used as a starting point for the newton - krylov algorithm , @xmath91 smoothly decreased down to @xmath101 .",
    "the exact solution found was the asymmetric travelling wave again but now shifted by an angle of 51.56 degrees .",
    "on the basis that the newton - krylov method usually needs to be in the vicinity of an exact solution to converge to it , this suggests the existence of a relative homoclinic connection near the computed trajectory . collecting firmer evidence is difficult unless the dynamics is further restricted .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made along these lines in plane couette flow by gibson it et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who have demonstrated the existence of a heteroclinic connection between two steady solutions on @xmath0 for a minimal flow unit .",
    "the technique developed above to identify recurrent states in the edge can also equally be applied to the dynamics within a symmetry subspace . restricting the flow to be @xmath132-symmetric , for example ,",
    "improves the possibility of an edge trajectory coming close to some of the @xmath132-symmetric lower branch tws found to be in the edge by kerswell & tutty ( 2007 ) .",
    "there is also , of course , the possibility of discovering unknown branches of tws .",

    "interestingly , this edge trajectory , although seemingly chaotic , is much smoother than the corresponding ( same @xmath9 and @xmath107 ) edge trajectory for @xmath31 : compare figures [ e1 ] and [ e2 ] . of the 5 initial conditions for a newton - krylov search",

    "the exact recurrence states found , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( see figure [ plots2 ] ) , correspond to two new types of travelling wave branches distinct from those originally reported in faisst & eckhardt ( 2003 ) and wedin & kerswell ( 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath140 is especially interesting as it is the first tw found in pipe flow which is _ not _ @xmath117-symmetric .",
    "it does , however , possess a mirror symmetry @xmath142 where @xmath143 ( or equivalently @xmath144 because of the imposed @xmath62-symmetry ) for the snapshot shown in figure [ plots2 ] .",
    "in contrast , @xmath141 has three symmetries : two unimposed - @xmath117 and @xmath145 ( where @xmath146 defines the plane of shift-&-reflect symmetry ) - and one imposed - @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath141 is actually one member of a whole new class of _",
    "tws which have subsequently been uncovered ( the @xmath147-class , see pringle et al .",
    "these new waves are significant because they appear much earlier in @xmath9 than the originally discovered tws ( faisst & eckhardt 2003 , wedin & kerswell 2004 ) and their upper branch solutions look more highly nonlinear .      in this subsection ,",
    "the flow is again restricted to be @xmath62-symmetric but the pipe is halved in length ( @xmath148 so @xmath149 ) and @xmath9 reduced to @xmath150 ( resolution is @xmath151 ) .",

    "a new asymmetric tw which has a small but finite azimuthal phase speed has been discovered .",
    "* some evidence was gathered for a  relative \" homoclinic connection between the asymmetric tw and the same wave with a different orientation . *",
    "calculations within a @xmath62-symmetric subspace have revealed new branches of @xmath62-symmetric tw solutions .",
    "one ( @xmath140 ) is the first tw found _ not _ to be shift-&-reflect symmetric in pipe flow , while the others are members of new classes of _ highly_-symmetric tws ( pringle et al . 2008 ) .",
    "* the laminar - turbulent boundary restricted to @xmath62-symmetry has at least two simple local attractors in the form of tws at @xmath165 .",
    "+    our numerical experiments have shed some light on the dynamical structure of @xmath0 in pipe flow . when no symmetry is imposed , and the pipe is approximately @xmath11 long ( @xmath61 ) , trajectories which neither relaminarise nor become turbulent all look chaotic and visit some exact recurrent states in a transient manner . in all cases",
    "studied , these exact solutions appear to be specifically the asymmetric tws found by pringle & kerswell ( 2007 ) even though many other lower branch tws are embedded in @xmath0 ( kerswell & tutty 2007 ) .",
    "no rpos were found even though the numerical method was sufficiently general to find them , in addition to tws . whether this is because the rpos are rarely visited or just more difficult to isolate is unclear .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that chaos on the edge of pipe flow is structured around a set of unstable saddle points ( the tws ) linked together by heteroclinic or sometimes relative heteroclinic connections .",
    "an approximation to such a connection has been shown in subsection [ sec : heteroc ] .",
    "the resulting dynamical structure is likely to be a heteroclinic ( or homoclinic ) tangle , an efficient mechanism to produce chaotic trajectories in phase - space with the set of tws acting as a skeleton of the tangle . seen from this point of view , transition to turbulence from a given initial condition depends on the position of the initial state , in phase space , relative to the stable manifold of each exact state embedded in @xmath0 . when a trajectory approaches a travelling wave solution belonging to @xmath0 , its relative position to the boundary determines on which side of the edge the trajectory escapes , resulting in either relaminarisation or a turbulent transient ( see sketch in figure [ phasespace ] ) . +    .",

    "multiple local attractors appear in @xmath0 . a randomly - started trajectory , after a chaotic transient and approaches to states @xmath158 and @xmath170 , is attracted towards the tw solution @xmath164 .",
    "the fundamental difference between @xmath164 and all the other states mentioned so far lies in the number of unstable eigenvalues . when a tw has two or more unstable eigenvalues in a given subspace , the dimension of the intersection between its unstable manifold and the hypersurface @xmath0 is reduced by one but remains at least one .",
    "hence such a state remains a saddle point on @xmath0 : edge trajectories enter its vicinity along its stable manifold and escape along the unstable manifold .",
    "in contrast , when a state has only one unstable direction , this is necessarily normal to @xmath0 , so that the state becomes an attractor for dynamics restricted to the edge ( a relative attractor ) .",
    "we have shown that @xmath164 is one such tw , but there is at least one other , @xmath152 of kerswell & tutty ( 2007 ) .",
    "therefore we expect both these two states to be only _ local _ attractors on @xmath0 rather than global ones . in the cases of plane poiseuille and couette flow , a lower - branch solution exists which has only one unstable direction and is therefore a relative attractor ( toh & itano 1999 , itano & toh 2001 , wang _ et .",

    "while discrete rotational symmetry constraints might appear artificial , they have nevertheless served as a useful device for discovering new exact recurrent solutions ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the method developed here based on edge tracking , recurrence analysis and use of a newton - krylov algorithm , is a general approach for finding new exact recurrent solutions in any flow situation possessing subcritical behaviour .",
