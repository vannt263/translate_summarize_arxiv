    "water is predicted to be one of the most abundant species in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and , besides co , the main reservoir of oxygen . in warm regions ( @xmath9  k ) , where water sublimates from icy grain mantles , or is efficiently formed in the gas phase through reactions involving atomic oxygen , its gas - phase abundance may be as high @xmath10 with respect to h@xmath3 ( e.g. , ceccarelli et al .",

    "to model h@xmath0o lines , we use the spherically symmetric monte carlo radiative transfer code ratran ( hogerheijde & van der tak 2000 ) .",
    "the source model consists of a number of shells with varying h@xmath3 density , water abundance , temperature , turbulent velocity , and expansion velocity .",
    "from such a source model , ratran calculates a grid of spectra integrated along a pencil beam , which has to be convolved to the required spatial resolution . the molecular data ( einstein coefficients and collisional rates calculated by faure et al .",
    "2007 ) are taken from the lamda database ( schier et al .",
    "the source structure is taken from rolffs et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , based on apex line and continuum observations , assuming a power - law density structure and solving for the temperature distribution self - consistently .",
    "this spherically symmetric model does not account for the outflow .",
    "since the outflow features are dominant in several h@xmath0o spectra , we had modified the source model accordingly .    simply adding shells with a corresponding expansion velocity to the existing source model",
    "does not reproduce the outflow features appropriately .",
    "such an approach fails , because , as shown in paper i and  3.3.2 , only 17% of the continuum is covered by the optically thick outflow .",
    "furthermore , the outflow is collimated almost along the line of sight , whereas a modeling approach with an expanding shell would reproduce rather an isotropic outflow . to model the collimated outflow , we thus calculated two ratran models",
    ". the first model does not include any outflow features .",
    "the second one includes an isotropic outflow represented by a number of expanding shells . before convolving the grid of spectra with the beam size of the observations , we combined these two models to simulate the desired geometry .    the ratran model without an outflow",
    "was calculated using the source model from rolffs et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , with the water abundance as the only parameter . for the model with an outflow",
    ", we use the same input parameters as for the first model , but add a number of expanding shells representing the outflow .",
    "temperature , density , and water abundance in these additional shells are treated as free parameters .",
    "the output of both model calculations is a grid of pencil - beam spectra .",
    "we combine these two grids by taking spectra from the model with an outflow for points on the grid less than @xmath60 from the center , whereas , we use the results from the model without an outflow for points further away .",
    "the radius of @xmath60 was chosen to cover approximately 20% of the continuum , in agreement with previous results .",
    "this combined grid was convolved with a gaussian corresponding to the respective telescope beam size .",
    "an alternative , simpler approach is to take the output of the radiative transfer model without an outflow and add the result of a fourth order polynomial fit of the outflow based on the observed spectra , also correcting for the difference between the model and observed continuum .",
    "fits were done using velocities @xmath61 kms@xmath62 ( blue lobe ) and @xmath63 kms@xmath62 ( red lobe ) .",
    "this method gives better constraints on water abundance in the hot core and quiescent envelope , because uncertainties due to the emission from the outflow are minimized , but the model is not self - consistent .",
    "assuming a constant water abundance , the model fails to reproduce the observed line profiles , and we are forced to vary the abundance with temperature . for gas above 100  k , we derive a water abundance of @xmath64 , whereas below 100  k the abundance drops to @xmath65 .",
    "the h@xmath3o abundance below 100  k agrees fairly well with theoretical models , as well as results of other investigations ( e.g. , boonman et al .",
    "2003 ; chavarra et al .",
    "doty et al . (",
    "2002 ) predicts an h@xmath3o abundance @xmath66 even at dust temperatures above 100 k due to the destruction by ions , such as c@xmath67 , h@xmath67 , h@xmath68 , and he@xmath67 .",
    "however , their model does not include formation of water on grain surfaces , or continuous sublimation of ices infalling from the cold envelope toward the center of the protostar . other models , such as ceccarelli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and rodgers & charnley ( 2003 ) suggest a water abundance of @xmath10 in warm gas , which is approximately two orders of magnitude higher then our result . however , it is important to note that the temperature and the amount of hot gas might be overestimated in the ratran model due to the assumed geometry .",
    "the assumed spherical symmetry results in a lower escape probability of the cooling photons , than for other geometries .",
    "this lower escape probability may lead to an overestimation of the temperature in the inner part of the star - forming region .",
    "the water abundance in the outflow can not be determined , since the outflow model is mainly defined by features due to the warm and dense outflow , for which no independent mass estimate exists . however , the total number of water molecules in the outflow is @xmath69 , which results in a total outflow mass of @xmath70 m@xmath39 , assuming an h@xmath3o abundance of @xmath71 as found in the broad outflow ( paper i ) .",
    "thus the mass is only about 5% of the mass of the broad outflow as determined by leurini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which may explain why this outflow feature is not detected in co. we also compared the model results with observations of h@xmath2o and h@xmath1o , using an h@xmath0o / h@xmath2o abundance ratio of 500 and an h@xmath0o / h@xmath1o ratio of 1600 .",
    "the best fit results for our model are show in figures  8 and 9 .",
    "the results of models , where the outflow was only fitted and not actually modeled ( blue lines ) show that the main component is reproduced quite well .",
    "one exception is ortho - h@xmath3o @xmath72 , which is a factor of three stronger than predicted by our model .",
    "another exception is the para - h@xmath3o @xmath73 transition , which is predicted to be very week ( 0.015 k ) , with the observed line approximately seven times stronger ( 0.11 k at a velocity of 7.7 kms@xmath62 ) .",
    "one explanation could be that the @xmath73 line shows maser activity .",
    "alternatively this line could be also blended with other lines , especially considering the rather large line width ( 6.5 kms@xmath62 ) and taking into account the richness of the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "however , we could not identify potentially interfering lines in the major molecular spectroscopy databases ( jpl , pickett et al . 1998 ; cdms , mller et al .",
    "2005 ) .    for lines with very high optical depths ,",
    "i.e. , ortho - h@xmath3o @xmath44 or para - h@xmath3o @xmath43 , the model calculations predict some emission in the line wings , which is not seen in the observed spectra .",
    "modeling the outflow is difficult . with the exception of the ortho - h@xmath3o @xmath44 , where we can not find an acceptable model ,",
    "there is a _ qualitative _ agreement between the model and observed line shapes ( emission , absorption , or a p - cygni profile ) .",
    "however , there are significant _ quantitative _ differences between detailed line shapes and line strengths predicted by the model and the observations , which indicate a limitation of the one - dimensional approach",
    ". the lines of the rarer isotopologues are not well reproduced ( figure  10 ) .",
    "the strengths of the modeled h@xmath2o lines are typically only 60% of the observed ones , whereas modeled h@xmath1o lines are much too weak .",
    "this indicates that the warm material might reside in small , dense clumps and thus the optical depths of the water lines may be underestimated by the models .",
    "this shows that a much more realistic three dimensional radiative transfer model is required to fit the water lines properly , which in turn requires detailed interferometric spectral maps of the source .",
    "the h@xmath0o abundances in the cold envelope ( @xmath74  k ) and the foreground clouds of @xmath65 and @xmath75 , respectively , agree fairly well with model predictions for cold regions ( e.g. , ceccarelli et al .",
    "1996 , doty et al .",
    "2002 ) , where freeze - out takes place .",
    "chemical models also reproduce the water abundance of @xmath47 found in the broad outflow component , where we expect water ices to be sputtered from the dust grains .",
    "however , the water abundance we derive in the hot core ( @xmath76 ) is two orders of magnitude lower than the value predicted by chemical models for hot , high - density material .",
    "the hot core h@xmath3o abundance in ngc  6334  i derived here is in agreement with hifi studies of hot corinos in low - mass star forming regions ( e.g. , visser et al . 2012 ; kristensen et al .",
    "2012 ) , but in contrast to some previous studies of water in high - mass star forming regions ( melnick et al . 2010 ; chavarra et al . 2010 ; herpin et al . 2012 ) that found water abundances of order @xmath10 at temperatures above 100  k. a high water abundance in the warm gas is only expected if all water molecules sublimate from the dust grains and stay as h@xmath3o in the gas phase .",
    "a possible explanation for the low water abundances in ngc  6334  i are time dependent effects ",
    "water molecules may not have had enough time to fully desorb from the dust grains , or are quickly destroyed in the gas phase .",
    "another possibility is that the dust temperature is moderate , near the threshold for the water ice sublimation , and therefore a significant fraction of water molecules may still reside on the dust grains .",
    "in addition , the presence of small - scale structures , such as disks or fragmented dense cores , may lead to overestimating the amount of the _ warm _ h@xmath3 based on dust continuum observations  if the h@xmath3 column density is overestimated , the resulting h@xmath3o abundance may be underestimated .",
    "lines of the rare water isotopes suggest that the internal structure of this source may be more complex and , therefore , future , more detailed investigations of the h@xmath3o abundance have to take into account the detailed structure of the embedded cores .",
    "the two detected outflow components in ngc 6334  i are physically very different .",
    "the broad outflow , which has been previously detected in co ( leurini et al .",
    "2006 ) , is of moderate temperature ( @xmath77 k ) and density ( @xmath78 @xmath14 ) .",
    "the narrow outflow ( @xmath79  k , @xmath80 @xmath14 ) , which , to our knowledge , has not been identified in other tracers , is warmer and denser , which confirms that water is an excellent tracer of dense outflows ( santangelo et al .",
    "whether these two components are actually two different outflows , or different regions within the same outflow can not be conclusively answered .",
    "the fact that the central velocity of both outflow component is 10 kms@xmath62 points to the latter interpretation .    the ortho / para ratio in water is @xmath4 in the foreground clouds , as well as the outflow .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario , in which water molecules are formed with an ortho / para ratio of three , and the reactions which would cause a spin flip , such as those with h@xmath67 and h@xmath68 , are of minor importance .",
    "the abundances of the rarer water isotopologues are consistent with the elemental abundance ratios .",
    "the h@xmath2o / h@xmath1o ratio in the dense core is @xmath81 , in agreement with the ratio of 3.7 found in the broad outflow component ( paper i ) and , within the uncertainties , consistent with the @xmath49o/@xmath50o isotopic ratio .",
    "hdo is detected in the hot core , as well as the broad outflow component .",
    "the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in both regions is @xmath8 , a factor ten above the cosmic abundance of deuterium , and close to the value found in earth oceans .",
    "however , this ratio is much lower than that typically found in low - mass star forming regions ( @xmath82 , codella et al .",
    "2010 ) , and at the lower end of values found in other high - mass star forming regions ( bergin et al . 2010 ; comito et al .",
    "2003 , 2010 ; van der tak et al .",
    "hdo is formed in excess in cold clouds , either in the gas - phase or on dust grains , where many deuterated molecules are abundant , whereas at higher temperatures ( @xmath83  k ) hdo / h@xmath3o ratios similar to the one found here are predicted ( roberts & millar 2000 ) .",
    "the high hdo abundance in orion kl was interpreted as material recently desorbed from dust grains , and thus the high hdo / h@xmath3o ratio reflects the physical conditions from the past .",
    "thus the low hdo / h@xmath3o ratio in ngc  6334  i , in agreement with the relatively low water abundance , is another indication that most water , especially water formed during the cold early stages of star - formation , is still frozen - out onto dust grains .",
