    "kdv solitary waves interact nonlinearly such that @xcite their peaks either first merge together and then split apart if the speed ratio of the waves is greater than @xmath6 or first bounce and then exchange shapes and speeds if the speed ratio of the waves is less than @xmath6 .",
    "there are many different alternative ways to interpret this nonlinear interaction , such as the faster wave getting stretched while the slower wave is squeezed underneath it , or as the faster wave emitting an intermediate wave that is absorbed by slower wave .",
    "( see for a comprehensive survey of interpretations . )",
    "the same interaction properties also hold more generally for pair - wise collisions of any number of kdv solitary waves .",
    "solutions of the kdv equation describing collisions of @xmath7 solitary waves are called @xmath8-solitons and have been obtained by many different methods ( / auto - backlund transformations , nonlinear superposition formula , hirota bilinear equations , inverse scattering , dressing equations ) , all of which rely on the underlying integrability of the kdv equation , in particular the existence of a lax pair @xcite . an important consequence of this integrability is that kdv solitons have constants of motion consisting of mass , momentum , galilean momentum , and energy , which are defined by conserved integrals @xcite involving @xmath9 , plus an infinite number of higher - order `` energies '' ( involving higher order @xmath10-derivatives of @xmath11 ) @xcite .    in this paper , we study the collision properties of solitons of the modified kdv ( mkdv ) equation u_t + u^2 u_x + u_xxx = 0 [ mkdveq ] and its integrable @xmath0-invariant generalizations @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath11 , and @xmath14 denotes the modulus of @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary positive constants .",
    "these two generalizations are known to be @xcite the only complex versions of the mkdv equation that possess a lax pair with the same scaling symmetry t^3 t , xx , u^-1 u [ scalingsymm ] admitted by the mkdv equation .",
    "both generalizations also have an additional @xmath0 phase symmetry u(i ) u [ phasesymm ] in this form , all three equations , , share the same solitary wave solution ( / a @xmath17-soliton ) u(t , x ) = ( ( x - ct ) ) [ realsoliton ] where @xmath18 is the wave speed .",
    "as shown by the results in on constants of motion for equations of complex mkdv form , the solitary wave solution has mass , momentum and energy , which are given by counterparts of the kdv conserved integrals involving just @xmath19 ; in addition , although there is no counterpart of kdv galilean momentum for this solution , it has an analogous galilean energy given by a conserved integral which is related to the motion of center of momentum .    in the case of the real mkdv equation",
    ", the @xmath17-soliton has an up or down orientation corresponding to the plus or minus sign of @xmath11 , which comes from the discrete reflection symmetry @xmath20 of this equation .",
    "thus , there are two different types of real mkdv soliton collisions , where ( up to reflection ) the fast and slow solitons in the collision have either the same orientation or opposite orientations .    in both cases of the complex mkdv equations and , the sign of the @xmath17-soliton can be absorbed into an arbitrary constant phase u(t , x ) = ( i ) ( ( x - ct ) ) , = [ 1soliton ] due to the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "consequently , collisions of two complex mkdv solitons involve a relative phase angle , given by the difference of the phase angles of the fast and slow solitons in the collision .",
    "this relative phase therefore parameterizes the types of collisions .",
    "an interesting question we will study is whether the two phase angles are altered in a collision , / do the fast and slow solitons each get shifted in phase as well as in position ?    in , the @xmath1-soliton solution that describes collisions of fast and slow solitary waves for the mkdv equation is reviewed .",
    "the properties of these collisions depend only on the ratio of speeds and the relative orientation of the two waves .",
    "in particular , we show that if the waves have the same orientation then their nonlinear interaction in a collision either is a merge - split type when their speed ratio is greater than the value @xmath21 , or otherwise is a bounce - exchange type when their speed ratio is less than this critical value @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , if the waves have opposite orientations then their nonlinear interaction instead is a completely different type in which ( regardless of their speed ratio ) the slow soliton gradually is first absorbed and then emitted by the fast soliton . in all three interactions , we show that the net effect of the collision is solely that the faster wave is shifted forward in position while the slower wave is shifted backward in position , such that the center of momentum of the two waves is unaffected ( moving at a constant speed throughout the collision ) .    in",
    ", we consider the complex mkdv equation , which is commonly called the hirota - mkdv equation @xcite .",
    "we carry out an asymptotic analysis of the @xmath1-soliton solution describing collisions of fast and slow solitary waves .",
    "our results show that the interaction properties of the two waves depend only on their speed ratio and their relative phase angle such that a bounce - exchange type of interaction occurs when the speed ratio is less than a critical value given by a certain explicit function of the relative phase angle and that otherwise a merge - split or absorb - emit type of interaction occurs depending on whether the relative phase angle is less than or greater than a certain critical value in terms of the speed ratio of the waves . for each type of interaction",
    ", we find that the phase angles of the two waves remain unchanged and the only effect of the collision is to produce a respective forward and backward shift in the positions of the faster and slower waves .",
    "in particular , these shifts are found to depend only on the speeds of the two waves , but not on their phases angles , such that the center of momentum of the two waves moves at a constant speed throughout the collision .    in , we consider the other complex mkdv equation , which is known as the sasa - satsuma - mkdv equation @xcite .",
    "we write down the @xmath1-soliton solution in an explicit form parameterized by the speeds and phase angles of the fast and slow solitary waves ( which has not appeared previously in the literature ) . through an asymptotic analysis of this solution",
    ", we find the interesting new result that the phase angles of the two waves in a collision undergo a shift such that the relative phase angle changes sign .",
    "in addition , the positions of the fast and slow waves display a respective forward and backward shift which depends on both the speeds and the relative phase angle of the waves . we show that these position shifts preserve the center of momentum of the two waves in the collision , while the phase - angle shifts are related to an invariance property of @xmath1-soliton solution with respect to space - time reflection combined with phase conjugation .",
    "finally , we also derive the detailed interaction properties of the two waves .",
    "we show that the waves exhibit a bounce - exchange type of interaction only when their the relative phase angle is less than @xmath22 and their speed ratio is less than a critical value given by a certain explicit function of the relative phase angle ( which is different than the function arising for the hirota - mkdv @xmath1-soliton solution ) . for any speed ratio greater than this value , or for any relative phase angle greater than @xmath22 , we find that the waves exhibit a merge - split type of interaction if their relative phase angle is less than a certain critical value in terms of the their speed ratio ( which is again different than the critical angle found for the hirota - mkdv @xmath1-soliton solution ) , and that otherwise the waves exhibit an absorb - emit type of interaction .",
