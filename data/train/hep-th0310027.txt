    "[ intro ] since the discovery of the non perturbative role played by strings with dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite the boundary state formalism , first used in @xcite , has been further developed .",
    "it has proven to be useful in a number of situations such as , for example , in reading which supergravity fields are switched on in presence of branes @xcite or in analyzing the rolling of the tachyon ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "all the boundary states used were trivially a superposition of boundary states and they did not describe any open string interactions ( see however app .",
    "a of the first of @xcite ) : this can be rephrased technically by saying that the boundary state of @xmath0 branes was taken to be equal to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the boundary state of a single brane .",
    "this leaves the doubt whether it is possible to describe with the boundary state formalism open string interactions or a non trivial superposition of branes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that it is actually simple to describe open / open and open / closed string interactions within the closed string formalism and that it is also possible to describe with a unique boundary state a set of several parallel branes interacting among themselves in the open string channel : an example of the amplitudes described by the boundaries we consider can be seen in fig.s ( [ figure:3open-1closed ] , [ figure : disk-3open-1closed ] ) . in doing",
    "so we notice how the open string knows about the closed string already at the tree level .",
    "we will show this starting from mixed closed / open string amplitudes and then factorizing them in the closed channel in order to get boundary states which describe open string interactions expressed using closed string operators : the resulting boundary state ( see eq .",
    "( [ b_alpha ] ) ) is for equal parallel branes in generic position , i.e. when the branes are not superimposed and the low energy gauge group is a product of one @xmath3 for each brane .",
    "it is nevertheless easy to get the non generic situation with enhanced gauge group ( see eq .",
    "( [ b_alpha_cp ] ) ) .",
    "since it is possible to describe open string interactions with closed string formalism it is natural to ask whether it is possible to do the opposite , i.e. to describe pure closed string interactions within open string formalism .",
    "an almost positive answer is given in @xcite where closed string amplitudes ( with a special state insertions ) are obtained from an ordered sequence of d - branes located at imaginary time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ par1 ]",
    "we fix our notations ( see also appendix [ conventions ] ) by reviewing how to compute mixed open / closed string amplitudes in open string formalism and we comment also on how chan - paton factors emerge naturally when branes are moved from a generic position where they are parallel but non superimposed to a superimposed configuration .",
    "we then write the vertices which describe the emission of closed string states using only open string fields and vertices for the emission of open strings hanging between two parallel but separated branes up to cocycles .",
    "the cocycles are discussed in section [ par2 ] for both open and closed string formalism : they are necessary to ensure the vertices commutativity in both closed and open formalism and allow a consistent factorization of amplitudes .",
    "we start computing the cocycles in closed string formalism since the vertices for the emission of closed string states in open string formalism must reproduce the same opes as in the closed string sector .",
    "it is worth stressing that in order to achieve the full consistency of the theory is necessary not only to introduce cocycles but also to let @xmath4 ( which is the position of the @xmath5 boundary of the string when we t - dualize to a configuration where all space directions have dd boundary conditions or the wilson lines on the brane at @xmath5 when all directions are nn ) change after the emission of an open string .",
    "this change is also necessary and felt by closed string vertices when all boundary conditions are nn .",
    "moreover it is interesting to notice that cocycles are not invariant under t - duality and therefore amplitudes are determined up to an overall sign .    in section [ par3 ] using the classical techniques we perform the factorization of the open string formalism amplitudes into the closed string channel and we obtain the explicit form of boundary states describing a bunch of parallel branes interacting in the open channel .",
    "these boundary states can be used , for example , to recover mixed string amplitudes of one closed string state with many open string states simply by performing the product with the closed string state or to obtain one loop amplitudes by computing boundary - boundary interaction .",
    "finally in section [ par - conc ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "[ par1 ]    interactions among closed and open strings were extensively studied already in the early days of string theory @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite ademollo et al . constructed vertex operators for the emission of a closed string out of an open string , and computed the scattering amplitudes among @xmath6 closed and @xmath7 open strings at tree level .",
    "the topology of the string world - sheet corresponding to these amplitudes is that of a disk emitting @xmath7 open strings from its boundary and @xmath6 closed strings from its interior . as customary in those days",
    ", only neumann boundary conditions were imposed on the disk , and no target - space compactification was considered .",
    "this formalism was extended to the case of mixed neumann - neumann and dirichlet - dirichlet boundary conditions in a compactified target space in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find now useful to recall here these results also in order to fix our notations .",
    "we consider a bosonic string described by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) propagating in a partially compactified space - time with toroidal compact directions @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , to simplify the notation we will generically set all @xmath12 .",
    "both compact and non compact directions can have either nn or dd boundary conditions .",
    "the emission from the disk of an open string state with internal quantum numbers @xmath39 is described by a vertex operator @xmath40 up to a possible cocycle to be discussed later .",
    "the vector @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) must be interpreted as @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 in directions with nn boundary conditions and as @xmath45 in the ones with dd boundary conditions direction this requires a little explanation , see @xcite and also our further discussion in section 3.2 ) .",
    "the string endpoints can be attached on two different branes at a distance @xmath46 in such a dd direction .",
    "this changes the mass shell condition due to the energy coming from the tension of the stretched string while the vertex still must have conformal dimension one , hence we must explicitly act on the @xmath47 vacuum with an operator to get this distance . ] . in particular for compact nn directions we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the emission of a closed string state with momentum in non compact direction @xmath50 , momentum @xmath51 , @xmath52 in compact direction and left and right quantum numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 , is described by a vertex operator @xmath55 : the presence of a boundary on the world sheet imposes a relation between the left and right parts of @xmath56 which are not independent of each other .",
    "in fact it is possible to write @xcite instead : the two vertices @xmath57 and @xmath58 differ in fact by a phase @xmath59 which is non trivial in presence of compact directions .",
    "the answer is that the true vertices need a cocycle and that the two versions of the vertices must have different cocycles since they both must reproduce the closed opes . ]",
    "@xmath60 again up to a cocycle .",
    "we would like to stress that the vertex operator @xmath57 depends on a single set of oscillators ( _ i.e. _ those of the open string ) , and that each factor in eq .",
    "( [ wertex ] ) is separately normal ordered .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the vertex operators describing the emission of a closed string out of a closed string where there are two distinct sets of oscillators for the left and right sectors which only share the zero - mode in the non compact case .",
    "a simple and intuitive reason why it is possible to write closed string vertices using open string fields is that if we start with the free open string sigma model with whichever boundary condition we can always couple the graviton as @xmath61 and this means that the graviton vertex which follows from the weak coupling expansion @xmath62 can be expressed through the open string fields @xmath63 . in particular the quantum conformal properties required for a vertex implies its factorized form as shown in eq .",
    "( [ wertex ] ) for a generic closed string state . from the same argument this result applies to all the massless closed string excitations and it can be extended to massive states by ope .",
    "it is in this process that cocycles become unavoidable since otherwise the ope coefficients in closed and open formalism would differ by phases .    using the complete operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( i.e. with the cocycles included ) , the tree - level scattering amplitude among @xmath7 open and @xmath6 closed strings is given by @xmath66 ~\\prod_{j=1}^{n_c } d^2z_j   \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\langle 0 |~{\\rm t}\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n_o } { \\cal v}_{\\alpha_i}(x_i;k_i )   \\,\\prod_{j=1}^{n_c } { \\cal w}_{\\beta_{j l},\\beta_{j r}}(z_j , \\bar z_j ; k_{l~j } , k_{r~j } ) \\right )    volume of the projective group @xmath67 , t denotes the time ( radial ) ordering prescription , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are respectively the normalizations of the disk , of the open and of the closed vertex operators corresponding to a @xmath71 brane : they are explicitly given in appendix [ conventions ] .",
    "they are fixed so that the low energy limit of the previous amplitudes reproduces the corresponding field theoretical amplitudes of a theory living in @xmath72 spacetime dimensions with @xmath73 compact ones ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in eq .",
    "( [ ademampl ] ) the variables @xmath74 s are integrated on the real axis while the complex variables @xmath75 s are integrated on the upper half complex plane . in this expression",
    "we have not used chan - paton factors since we suppose the branes are in a generic position as in fig .",
    "[ figure:2branes ] , i.e. they are parallel but do not overlap ( hence we are restricting to the case of @xmath71 with @xmath76 ) and therefore the gauge group is a product of @xmath3 factors .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to introduce the chan - paton factors @xmath77 simply by performing the substitution @xmath78 when it is necessary , i.e. when the branes are not anymore in a generic position and they are stacked .",
    "the reason why we did not write the chan - paton factors in eq .",
    "( [ ademampl ] ) is that they are not necessary when branes are in a generic position .",
    "let us see why .",
    "a chan - paton factor is nothing but a matrix : in the simplest setting , i.e. for gauge group @xmath79 , we can take as the chan paton matrices @xmath80 .",
    "the matrices have one label @xmath81 for the brane where the string leaves from ( `` start brane '' ) and one label @xmath82 for the brane where the string ends ( `` end brane '' ) .    when computing an open string amplitude with chan - paton factors we first make a product of chan - paton matrices and this ensures that the end brane of a string is the start brane of the next one , then we take the trace of this product so that the brane where the last string ends is the brane where the first string originates .",
    "the result of the trace accounts for the degeneracy of diagram one is considering but in the generic setting this degeneracy is simply one therefore using the naive chan - paton factors in computing an amplitude involving @xmath0 branes in a generic position would yield the wrong degeneracy .",
    "in our case where the branes are in a generic position the role of the two labels can be taken by @xmath4 for the start brane and @xmath83 for the end brane . in computing amplitudes we have now to take care that the end brane of a string is the start brane of the next one since this is not anymore implied by matrix multiplication .",
    "the effect of momentum ( actually width ) conservation in dd directions in this formalism is to ensure that the sum of all string widths , defined each as @xmath84 , is zero : this is actually not a new constraint but a consistency condition . in the limit where some branes are superimposed , the brane position is not anymore enough to distinguish among them and it must be supplemented with a label , thus recovering chan - paton factors . it is interesting to note that amplitude ( [ ademampl ] ) is well defined even when there are some non compact directions with dd boundary conditions .",
    "when some non compact @xmath63 have dirichlet boundary condition it would seem that the correlator in ( [ ademampl ] ) be divergent since it is proportional to @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the would - be momentum vacua in the non compact dirichlet directions",
    ". these vacua @xmath86 should naively be normalized as @xmath87 since the corresponding directions are non compact but this is not the case .",
    "in fact we can normalize @xmath88 as @xmath86 is the only finite energy state because all the `` winding states '' have energy proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "this justifies the point of view that non compact dd directions must be understood as a limit of compactified ones , in particular the spectral decomposition of unity is then given by @xmath90 are the eigenstates of the corresponding @xmath91 .",
    "in this section we first determine the cocycles for closed string vertex operators in closed string formalism so that two closed string vertices commute with each other , then we fix the cocycles for closed string vertex operators in open string formalism by demanding that the normal ordering of the product of two closed string vertices be the same in both closed and open string formalism : this is done in order to be sure that it is possible to describe closed string emission in open formalism at all mass levels and that open / closed string amplitudes are correctly and consistently factorizable in the closed channel .",
    "we fix also the cocycles for open string emission vertices so that they commute with closed string ones . in doing",
    "so we realize that also @xmath4 , the quantity entering the left and right moving part of the open string fields given in eq.s ( [ xl - xr ] ) , has to change after the emission of an open string from the @xmath5 border and this change is fundamental even when open string has nn boundary condition ( see section [ explicit - example ] for an explicit example ) .",
    "all these cocycles and the transformation of @xmath4 turn out to be conceptually very important for a proper amplitudes factorization but of little practical importance as long as one is willing to drop phases in amplitudes .      as said before the first step is to determine the cocycles in the closed string formalism .",
    "a well defined cft for closed strings must satisfy at least the following criteria    1 .",
    "closed string vertices commute ; 2 .",
    "a proper behavior under hermitian conjugation .      for implementing the wanted properties we look for a solution of the form ( @xcite ) @xmath98 where the cocycles are given by @xmath99 we choose the coefficients @xmath100 to be matrices in order to be general .",
    "they have possibly only non vanishing entries in compact directions , e.g @xmath101 , since only when there are compact directions they are needed .",
    "they must be determined , as said before , so that two arbitrary vertices are mutually local , i.e. commute .",
    "this is also equivalent to the fact that the radial ordering of a product of vertices is given by a unique expression which can be derived by analytically continuing whichever particular ordering of the vertices is chosen to perform the computation .    in order to compute these matrices",
    "we consider the ordering of the product of two arbitrary vertices as @xmath102 where we have defined the phase @xmath103\\ ] ] and then we use the well known formula ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) ( see also appendix [ app_sds ] ) @xmath106_{\\mbox{an.con . } } = v(w;k_2)\\,v(z;k_1 ) e^{+i\\pi\\,sgn(arg(z)-arg(w))\\,2\\alpha'\\ , k_1 \\cdot k_2}\\ ] ] to compare with the product of the vertices in the opposite order @xmath107 and determine the unknown matrices . from the previous equations , as it is described in appendix ( [ details_cstr ] ) , we can deduce that the ( matrix ) coefficients in compact directions are @xmath108 where @xmath109 . in the rest of the paper",
    "we choose @xmath110 so that the cocycle in eq .",
    "( [ c_closed ] ) simply becomes where @xmath111 is the winding operator if one is willing to have vertices which are hermitian up to a phase and , hence , have a zamolodchikov metric not equal to the unity . ]",
    "@xmath112    the action of t - duality on the cocycle of the vertex is not trivial , since it exchanges the possible solutions available , i.e. a t - duality along the compact direction @xmath113 gives @xmath114 , @xmath115 or @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "the question is now whether we have different theories since different choices of cocycles yield amplitudes which differ by a phase .",
    "this question assumes that we read the actual effective theory vertices , signs included , from the string amplitudes . at first",
    "look we would answer yes since there is no way of redefining the fields of the effective action in a such a way that phases in front of amplitudes match , as it is easy to verify in the case of the three tachyons ( see eq .",
    "( [ 3 t ] ) in appendix ) . on the other side",
    "also loop corrections are proportional to the same phase of the tree level since moving the cocycles in front of the string of vertices yields the same numeric phase as in the tree level case ( this phase depends on external momenta only and does not depend on the number of handles ) times an operatorial cocycle like @xmath118 .",
    "now the above operatorial cocycle is identically @xmath119 since the numeric coefficients are zero because they are proportional to the sum of the external momenta which are conserved . because of this the would - be different theories we get give different s - matrix elements which nevertheless yield the same transition probability to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover the physical states created by the different vertices are the same .      a well defined cft for an open - closed string theory must satisfy at least the following 5 constraints :    1 .",
    "the open string vertices at @xmath5 and @xmath34 commute ; 2 .",
    "the open string emission vertex from @xmath5 commutes with the closed string vertices ; 3 .   in a similar way the open string emission vertex from @xmath34 commutes with the closed string vertices ; 4 .",
    "the closed string vertices in open string formalism must have the same `` ope '' as in closed string formalism , or more precisely we want the normal ordering of the product of two closed string vertices be formally equal to ( [ ope_closed ] ) , in particular we want the closed string vertices to commute ; 5 .   a proper behavior under hermitian conjugation .",
    "the previous constraints can fail only because of phases and these phases depend only on momenta therefore the problem amounts to find the proper cocycles and , as we discuss later , the proper shift of the @xmath4 ( which enters the definition of left and right moving part of the open string expansion given in eq.s ( [ xl - xr ] ) ) .    before writing the vertices it is worth stressing once again what discussed in section [ par1 ] : we want the closed string vertices be expressed using the open string operators only , i.e. closed strings are made of the same `` stuff '' of the open string they are emitted .",
    "we derive the vertices in appendix [ details_ostr ] , here we limit ourselves to write them explicitly @xmath120 along with the vertices for the emission from the @xmath34 boundary @xmath121 in this case the action of",
    "the cocycle simply means that we can substitute @xmath122_{zero~mode}=q-2\\alpha ' i p \\log(x ) \\rightarrow q-2\\alpha ' i p \\log ( |x |)$ ] and drop the cocycle .    while the previous vertices seem essentially the normal vertices , the closed string vertex does depend on @xmath4 since @xmath123 and @xmath4 changes along the worldsheet .",
    "this happens because we are taking the original point of view of @xcite according to which the `` stuff '' of the `` carrier '' string may change after the emission of another open string . because of this the closed string emission vertices do not change in form when written using the `` carrier '' string fields from which the closed string states are emitted but they do change when the actual `` carrier '' string fields are expressed using the fields of incoming `` carrier '' string .    the change of @xmath4 can be better appreciated by considering a carrier open string with dirichlet b.c . in at least one compact direction . in fig.s",
    "[ fig : y0-recoil ] we have pictured in two ways the interaction between an incoming open string stretched between brane 0 and brane 1 with another open string , the emitted string , stretched between brane 2 and brane 0 .",
    "the incoming string has dd b.c . @xmath124 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "the other string , which is emitted from the incoming one , stretches between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the result of the interaction is the outgoing string with @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the latter equation has a simple interpretation : when a string with dd b.c .",
    "is emitted from the @xmath5 border of the incoming open string the outgoing string has width equal to the sum of the incoming carrier string @xmath131 and the emitted string @xmath132 .",
    "this is taken care by the momentum @xmath133 conservation but the position of the @xmath5 border of the outgoing string is _ changed _ in such a way the position of the @xmath34 border is left unchanged , i.e. @xmath134",
    "the main point hence is that the open string changes its b.c .",
    "after the emission of a string from the @xmath5 boundary and therefore @xmath4 changes too accordingly .",
    "hence the closed string vertex does change when expressed using the incoming string fields . because of the expansions in eq.s ( [ xl - xr ] ) this change in @xmath4 means @xmath135 and @xmath136 hence the closed string vertex changes when inserted before or after the emission of the open string from the @xmath5 boundary .",
    "the proper commutation relation between a closed string and an open string emitted from @xmath5 then reads @xmath137_{an .",

    "since we are trying to ensure that all intermediate expressions be well defined with respect to vertices commutativity property and to keep track of how and where phases arise , the naive procedure adopted in ( @xcite,@xcite ) is not completely valid : details on how this can be accomplished are given in app .",
