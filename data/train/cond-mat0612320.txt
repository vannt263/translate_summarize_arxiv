    "during the past decade the field of molecular magnets has experienced a rapid evolution.@xcite nowadays a vast variety of species can be synthesized , ranging in size from 2 to more than 30 paramagnetic ions embedded in the host molecule.@xcite the fascinating properties of these new materials include hysteretic behavior,@xcite quantum tunneling of the magnetization,@xcite magnetocaloric,@xcite and magnetostrictive effects.@xcite    astonishingly , for several observables and not too low temperatures it is sufficient to treat magnetic molecules classically by applying the heisenberg model.@xcite this enables one to apply the powerful machinery of classical stochastic sampling methods .",
    "the metropolis algorithm @xcite has become the standard tool to calculate statistical classical properties of these nano magnets.@xcite recently , the wang - landau algorithm@xcite ( wl ) has been successfully applied to various problems in statistical physics and biophysics both to models with discrete @xcite as well as with continuous degrees of freedom.@xcite in this context the wl exhibits a superior feature in comparison to the metropolis algorithm . since the wl calculates the density of states ( dos ) , one can estimate thermodynamic observables such as the free energy and entropy for all temperatures using just one single simulation of the density of states .",
    "however , the calculation of the dos in energy space @xmath4 permits only to calculate thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature and at zero magnetic field , e.g. the zero - field specific heat , but not observables such as the magnetic susceptibility at non - vanishing field.@xcite for studying the magnetic properties of a system at arbitrary external magnetic field one has to calculate a joined dos @xmath3 in energy and magnetization space .",
    "once @xmath3 is known , properties like magnetization @xmath5 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 can be calculated at any temperature and any external magnetic field using again just one single simulation of the density of states.@xcite    in this article we introduce a self - adaptive version of the wl which allows to calculate the two - dimensional dos @xmath3 using a discrete binning scheme in the continuous energy and magnetization space . we demonstrate that the wl is capable to calculate efficiently all thermodynamic properties of rather large spin systems using the example of the magnetic keplerate molecule \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}.@xcite the dependencies of the thermodynamic observables both on temperature and external magnetic field can be obtained by only one single simulation .",
    "we conclude by discussing the problems arising at low temperatures and high magnetic fields .",
    "in the keplerate molecule \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } 30 iron  ( iii ) ions ( @xmath7 ) occupy the vertices of a perfect icosidodecahedron,@xcite see fig .",
    "[ f - a ] .",
    "the spins are coupled with their nearest neighbors by an isotropic and antiferromagnetic coupling of strength @xmath8",
    "k. the spectroscopic splitting factor is @xmath9.@xcite    fe@xmath1 } the vertices represent spin sites and the edges represent nearest neighbor interactions.,width=151 ]    we write the heisenberg hamiltonian as @xmath10 whereas @xmath11 directs that the sum is over distinct nearest - neighbor pairs , @xmath12 is an external magnetic field in @xmath13-direction , @xmath14 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath15 denotes classical vectors of length @xmath16.@xcite we use a self - adaptive @xcite scheme of the wl to calculate the two - dimensional dos @xmath3 , where @xmath17 denotes the heisenberg energy of a given spin configuration of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) without external magnetic field , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath5 is the magnetization in @xmath13-direction , which is defined as the sum over the @xmath13-components of all classical spin vectors : @xmath19 in contrast to the metropolis algorithm , where the acceptance probability of a new generated state is determined by @xmath20,1\\}$ ] , the wl is characterized by an acceptance ratio @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to energies before and after the transition .",
    "the original wl has been applied to models where the energy assumes only discrete values.@xcite since the heisenberg model consists of classical spin vectors which are continuously orientable , the possible energy and magnetization values are real numbers between the minimum and maximum energy and magnetization , respectively .",
    "thus , we discretize the continuous energy and magnetization range by the introduction of bins.@xcite we have chosen bins of uniform width of @xmath24  k in energy and @xmath25 in magnetization range . to speed up the simulation we divide the total energy range in eight overlapping intervals and follow the recipe in ref .   to avoid boundary effects",
    "a priori it is not known , which magnetization bins are accessible by the random walker in a certain energy interval . a striking feature of the wl is , that one does not have to know anything about the dos one wants to calculate .",
    "following the original wl , the random walker biases itself to explore the accessible energy and magnetization space .",
    "to do so , we have chosen the following procedure : at the beginning we perform a trial run for the desired energy interval .",
    "we introduce an initial dos @xmath26 and a reference histogram @xmath27 , and perform spin flips according the original wl procedure accepting and neglecting new spin configurations for a defined number of monte - carlo steps @xmath28 .",
    "one monte - carlo step corresponds to a single spin tilt event . each time",
    "a bin ( @xmath29 ) is visited the corresponding entries in @xmath30 and @xmath31 are updated , whereas @xmath32 is the initial modification factor . following this recipe",
    "the random walker triggers itself to explore the accessible energy and magnetization space for a predefined energy interval .     for the molecule \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}.",
    "@xmath33 defines the accessible energy and magnetization space .",
    "the grid shows the bins in energy and magnetization space.,width=226 ]    after @xmath28 steps have been performed we stop the initial run .",
    "now we continue with the normal wl for the same energy interval . as an initial guess for the dos we use @xmath34 .",
    "a new state is only accepted if the corresponding entry in @xmath27 is not zero , compare fig .",
    "[ f - b ] .",
    "in other words , we accept only states corresponding to bins in the energy and magnetization space which have already been visited during the initial run , otherwise the new generated state is neglected according to ref .  .",
    "in addition , the relative flatness of the accumulated histogram is only checked after all valid entries in the reference histogram have been visited at least one hundred times .",
    "of course the total runtime of the simulation as well as the accuracy of the finally calculated dos are very sensitive to a good choice of @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath28 is chosen very large , the random walker explores bins at the boundaries of the accessible energy and magnetization space , which are rarely visited .",
    "thus the dos for these entries is small and does not contribute significantly to the partition function .",
    "nevertheless , sampling of these states increases the total runtime of the simulation since a flat histogram is to be accumulated during the simulation . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath28 is chosen too small , the energy and magnetization space is sparsely explored and many bins of the accessible energy and magnetization space are not visited , resulting in an inaccurate estimate of the dos .",
    "thus , the question is to find a good tradeoff between runtime and accuracy of @xmath3 . to estimate a reasonable value for @xmath28 for each energy interval",
    ", we have chosen different values and counted the number of visited distinct bins in @xmath27 after finishing the initial run .",
    "it turns out that the number of visited bins shows some saturation behavior . after a critical number of steps",
    "the visited energy and magnetization space does not grow significantly any more .",
    "thus , after this critical number of steps has been reached we consider the accumulated @xmath27 to be a good estimate for the successive wl run . as the initial modification factor @xmath32 we have chosen a rather large value of @xmath35 and",
    "reduce @xmath32 in large steps.@xcite after finishing the initial run we perform 14 steps decreasing @xmath32 according to the recipe @xmath36{f_i}$ ] resulting in a final modification factor of 1.000000015 .",
    "after @xmath3 has been obtained , the magnetization @xmath37 as a function of temperature @xmath38 and external magnetic field @xmath39 can be calculated from @xmath40 the differential magnetic susceptibility @xmath41 can be computed by using the equation @xmath42.\\ ] ]    while without external magnetic field it is sufficient to calculate only the dos for negative energies , since states with positive energies due to their boltzmann factor @xmath43 practically do not contribute to the partition function , in the case of an external magnetic field also energy bins with a positive energy become important , since they might be low - lying in the case of an applied external field .",
    "thus it is required to calculate the dos over the full energy range of the system , if the properties at high magnetic fields are studied . the exact ground state energy for \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 }",
    "is known to be @xmath44  k,@xcite which is close to the lowest accessible energy bin of @xmath45  k. the classical ground state of the molecule is charactereized by relative angles of 120@xmath46 between nearest - neighbor spins.@xcite the possibility of generating such a spin configuration is practically zero , and thus an effective sampling of the dos near the ground state energy is not possible .",
    "the same is valid for the highest energy states of the molecule , where the probability of generating a spin configuration with all spins pointing in the same direction is unlikely .",
    "the highest energy bin visited during the initial run is @xmath47  k. as the criterion of flatness we used a relatively small value of 0.5 , and to further decrease the statistical error we perform four runs , calculate the magnetic properties for each of these runs and compute the mean value and mean standard deviation afterwards . on a personal computer ( intel , xeon , 2.60  ghz ) the sampling of the complete dos took about 120 hours of cpu time .    for a comparison of accuracy we performed extensive monte - carlo simulations using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we perform @xmath48 spin tilt trials to let the system reach equilibrium at a defined external magnetic field and temperature . afterwards for additional @xmath49 tilting trials the thermodynamic properties are computed .",

    "one notices that the low - energy boundary @xmath51 assumes a parabolic shape as observed for various systems.@xcite the region with @xmath52 at high energies indicates the global rotational symmetry of the system .",
    "one also notices that in the vicinity of the phase - space boundary the classical density of states grows very rapidly by orders of magnitude which explains why it is difficult to obtain very accurate results at the boundaries .",

    "figure  [ m_wl_metr_theory ] compares the magnetization at @xmath54  k and 4  k as a function of field for the wl and the metropolis simulations . as can be inferred from the figure , at a temperature of the order of the exchange coupling the wl reaches the same accuracy as the metropolis algorithm , but the latter has to be performed for each pair of variables @xmath55 , whereas with the wl the density of states has to be sampled only once in order to obtain the complete function @xmath56 .",

    "therefore , it will magnify inaccuracies of the simulated density of states .",
    "figure  [ suszvstb ] displays the susceptibility as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it can be seen that for temperatures higher than @xmath57 the behavior is rather smooth , but for lower temperatures a spiky behavior is observed which results from statistical fluctuations at the energy and magnetization space boundary . at @xmath58",
    "these fluctuations are still visible , but on average much smaller than the real minimum at about @xmath59,@xcite compare fig .",
    "[ suszvsb ] .",
    "clearly one can see that the dip in suszeptibility at about @xmath59 vanishes with increasing temperature.@xcite the spurious peak at @xmath60 and @xmath61 reflects the difficulty to obtain the density of states in close vicinity of the ground state . a comparison with metropolis simulations is shown is fig .",
    "[ suszvsb ] .",
    "the results obtained using both methods agree well .",
    "the fluctuations in the wl data are due to the missing bins in @xmath3 at the energy and magnetization space boundaries , since these features are apparent in all four wl runs .",

    "( color online ) specific heat @xmath62 as a function of temperature @xmath38 and external magnetic field @xmath39 . ]",
    "the last function we want to discuss in this paper is the specific heat @xmath62 as a function of temperature @xmath38 and external magnetic field @xmath39 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ shvstb ] the specific heat does not show too strong fluctuations at low temperature and fields below saturation .",
    "it seems that this observable is more robust against statistical fluctuations of the density of states than the susceptibility . in order to complete the discussion we display the specific heat also for magnetic fields above the saturation field where it shows strong fluctuations .",
    "they reflect magnified inaccuracies at the high energy boundary of @xmath3 and thus are spurious .    summarizing , one can say that the proposed self - adaptive version of the wang - landau algorithm can efficiently generate the density of states @xmath3 of a rather large spin system , such as the magnetic molecule \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}. the obvious advantage is that with one simulation of @xmath3 many thermodynamic observables can be evaluated as function of temperature and applied magnetic field .",
    "statistical fluctuations are apparent in the second derivatives of the two - dimensional dos , namely the specific heat and magnetic suszeptibility at low temperatures .",
    "these fluctuations can be minimized at the cost of computational time , by either increasing the number of bins or by a more strict flatness criterion .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that a fitting of the one - dimensional dos for a sampled energy interval by higher order polynomials results in a less fluctuating specific heat.@xcite nevertheless , it is stated , that this fitting procedure fails if one tries to extrapolate the dos outside the sampled energy interval using the fitting function .",
    "thus , further improvements are still needed to provide an effective sampling at the boundaries of @xmath3 . due to the fact that the density of states varies by many orders of magnitude it is clear that close to the boundaries of @xmath3 the statistics becomes poorer .",
