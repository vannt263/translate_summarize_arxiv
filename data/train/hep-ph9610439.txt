    "in the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) the neutrino masses are set to zero `` by hand '' . while all terrestrial experiments are consistent with this assumption , it is now clear that the solution of the solar neutrino problem requires nonzero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing @xcite .",
    "another motivation for neutrino masses comes from cosmology with the need of a hot dark matter particle in the few ev mass range or of a heavy ( @xmath3mev ) unstable particle @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath4-neutrino is an ideal candidate .",
    "however , astrophysics and cosmology provide also stringent limits for neutrino masses and lifetimes @xcite .",
    "in particular , the requirement that the neutrino energy density does not overclose the universe restricts the sum of the masses of all stable neutrino species to be less than @xmath5ev , where @xmath6 .",
    "in extended sms with neutrino mixing , neutrinos can decay by the process @xmath0 and , if the mass @xmath7 of the heavy neutrino is higher than @xmath2 , additionally by @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting lifetimes @xmath9 are , although strongly model - dependent , extremely long . in the simplest case",
    "where right - handed singlet fields @xmath10 are added to the sm the decay rate of the resulting dirac neutrinos is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the masses of the heavy and of the light neutrino , respectively . if we assume that the @xmath4-lepton dominates the sum over the internal leptons @xmath13 and that the elements of the mixing matrix @xmath14 are of order unity , eq .",
    "( [ tau_sm ] ) yields a lifetime @xmath15 years for @xmath16ev and @xmath17 .    since @xmath18 , neutrinos in the sm with lepton mixing",
    "can be treated as stable and the limit @xmath19ev applies .",
    "the principal reason for the extremely small decay widths of neutrinos is their small mass . obviously , the decay rate @xmath20 for the radiative decay has to be proportional to @xmath21 , and since for @xmath22 the only energy scale available is the mass of the heavy neutrino , it follows @xmath23 on purely dimensional grounds .",
    "this changes drastically if an external field is present .",
    "then , in the low - field limit @xmath24 the decay rates in magnetic fields @xmath25 depend only on the dynamical field parameters @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the momentum perpendicular to @xmath25 of the initial particle and @xmath28 are the critical fields of the charged particles , while in the strong field limit @xmath29 the decay rates can depend separately on @xmath30 and @xmath25 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the essential point is that the energy scale is set by the charged particles and not by the mass of the decaying particle .",
    "the best example for this mechanism is photon splitting @xmath31 .",
    "this process is forbidden in vacuum not only due to the furry theorem but also due to the zero mass of the photon . in an external field",
    "photon splitting is allowed and the energy scale is set by the charged particles running in the loop .",
    "for , e.g. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 the dominating contribution to the loop is that of the electron , and the decay rate is given by @xcite @xmath34    consequently , the decay of all light particles should be enhanced in strong external fields . for the example of the radiative decay of neutrinos this",
    "was shown for various external fields configurations by gvozdev _",
    "_ @xcite . in the case of a weak magnetic field @xmath35",
    ", they derived approximate decay rates valid for arbitrary momentum @xmath30 of the initial neutrino .",
    "however , in the strong field limit @xmath36 , they gave an asymptotic expression for the decay width valid only for @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "recently several authors proposed scenarios in which a strong magnetic field with @xmath38 in the early universe was created . among the ideas considered",
    "are the production of a magnetic field of @xmath39 g by the ferromagnetic yang - mills vacuum @xcite , of @xmath40 g during the electroweak phase transition @xcite , of @xmath41 g during hybrid inflation , where @xmath42 is the inflaton field with mass @xmath43 and higgs - coupling @xmath44 @xcite , inflation in string cosmology @xcite , etc .",
    "subsequently , several authors used nucleosynthesis to derive bounds on primordial magnetic fields @xcite . in these works , the effect of the magnetic field on the weak interaction rates @xmath45 and on the expansion rate of the universe was taken into account but the neutrinos were treated as stable .",
    "the limits obtained vary between @xmath46 g in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath47 g in ref .",
    "@xcite at the beginning of nucleosynthesis ( @xmath48mev ) .    obviously ,",
    "if the neutrino lifetime becomes of the order of the age of the universe at the time of nucleosynthesis or before , they can no longer be treated as stable . since the effect of a magnetic field is equivalent to an increase of the effective number of neutrino species @xmath49 , while the decay of a heavy neutrino before nucleosynthesis decreases @xmath49 from three to two , the limits obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite could be even weakened by taking into account neutrino decays .",
    "we consider the radiative decay of a heavy neutrino @xmath50 into a lighter neutrino @xmath51 and a photon @xmath52 in a strong magnetic field @xmath53 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose the magnetic field as @xmath54 and the three - momentum @xmath55 of the heavy neutrino perpendicular to @xmath56 , e.g. @xmath57 .",
    "the momenta of the light neutrino and of the photon are denoted by @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; the components perpendicular to @xmath25 have the index @xmath60 .",
    "if the energy of the heavy neutrino is small compared to the mass of the @xmath61-boson , @xmath62 , the four - fermion interaction can be used and the decay is described by the feynman diagram shown in fig .  1 . in this limit ,",
    "gvozdev _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found for the matrix element @xmath63 of the process @xmath0 @xmath64 where an effective matrix element @xmath65 and a function @xmath66 depending only on the ratio @xmath67 were introduced .",
    "the other abbreviations have the following meaning : the neutrino current @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the dual field tensor . for @xmath72",
    "the function @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 with @xmath75 where we corrected a typographical error ( in the argument of @xmath76 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ; a check of the relative signs in eq .",
    "( [ f>1 ] ) is given by the requirement @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the function @xmath73 can be analytically continued in the complex @xmath79 plane .",
    "then , for @xmath80 , the real part of @xmath73 follows simply as @xmath81 with @xmath82 while the imaginary part of @xmath73 is given by the dicontinuity across the branching cut starting at @xmath83 , viz .",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 using @xmath86 for @xmath87 , one sees that @xmath66 for @xmath80 given in ref .",
    "@xcite coincides  except for the sign of the term @xmath88with the real part given by us , but that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite missed to evaluate the imaginary part of @xmath73 .    in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case that the internal loop is dominated by the electron , i.e. that @xmath89 . in this case",
    ", the contribution of additional charged particles , e.g. from an enlarged higgs sector , to the sm can be neglected .",
    "therefore the decay rates will hold in the limit @xmath90 not only for the sm with lepton mixing but also for more general models of massive neutrinos . moreover , we set @xmath91 for simplicity .    the neutrino decay rate @xmath20 is given by @xmath92 averaging @xmath93 over spins , we obtain @xmath94   \\",

    "therefore the three particles propagate collinearly and the above expression reduces to @xmath98    the differential decay rate @xmath99 can be computed only for @xmath100 . moreover , as the singularities of @xmath101 at @xmath102 are not integrable , the total decay rate @xmath20 above the pair creation threshold is ill - defined .",
    "physically speaking , we have not taken into account the finite lifetime of neutrinos and photons in magnetic fields .",
    "usually , the finite lifetime is incorporated by the replacement of the energies @xmath103 by complexified energies @xmath104 in the denominators , where @xmath105 is the decay width of the state with energy @xmath103 .",
    "we note that , although this replacement seems natural , it is not unambiguous . to proceed , we assume that the decay widths of the neutrinos are neglectable compared to those of photons and insert the total decay width @xmath106 in the energy denominators of @xmath107 and @xmath108 . here",
    ", @xmath109 denotes the decay width of the process @xmath110 @xcite and @xmath111 the decay width of the process @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the two analytically tractable limits @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "the first approximation was already derived in ref .",
    "note that the energy dependence of the total decay rate is the same as that for photon splitting .",
    "we now discuss our numerical results , which were all computed using the approximation eq .",
    "( [ c - app ] ) and with @xmath121 , @xmath122 . in fig .",
    "2 the differential decay rate @xmath123 ( normalized to unity when integrated over the abscissa ) is shown for energies of the initial neutrino below ( left ) and above ( right ) the pair - creation threshold as a function of the energy @xmath124 of the emitted photon .",
    "the energy distribution between the photon and the light neutrino becomes more and more asymmetric for @xmath125 , and finally , for @xmath126 , the resonance for @xmath127 appears . for @xmath128 ,",
    "the differential decay rate has a plateau similar to the case of photon splitting .    a comparison between the total decay rate eq .",

    "( [ e<<m ] ) and its high - energy approximation eq .",
    "( [ e>>m ] ) is made in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the exact rate is well reproduced by the approximations except for small region around @xmath2 .    finally ,",
    "we have computed the lifetime @xmath4 of the heavy neutrino as a function of the age @xmath129 of the universe .",
    "hereby we have assumed that the magnetic field scales like @xmath130 , and used as the starting value @xmath131 the limits obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the onset of nucleosynthesis at @xmath132s .",
    "if the lifetime is below @xmath133 and the temperature @xmath134 of the universe lower than @xmath7 , the heavy neutrino decouples .",
    "decoupling occurs for @xmath135mev using @xmath136 g and for @xmath137mev using @xmath138 g .",
    "therefore , the frequently discussed @xmath4-neutrino with @xmath139mev @xcite is possible in this scenario without introduction of new interactions .",
    "we have presented the first analysis of the rate of radiative neutrino decay _ not _ restricted to momentum of the initial neutrino @xmath140 in the limit of strong magnetic fields @xmath36 .",
    "we have derived two simple approximations for the total decay rate valid for @xmath113 and @xmath114 in this limit .",
    "the decay rates obtained are extremely enhanced by the strong magnetic field . in particular , if a strong primordial magnetic field existed in the early universe , it is possible that a heavy neutrino with only standard model interactions may have decayed before the onset of nucleosynthesis .",
