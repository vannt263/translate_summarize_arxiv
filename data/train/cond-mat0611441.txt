    "the family of borocarbide superconductors @xmath12b@xmath0c , where @xmath13 is a rare - earth element and @xmath14 is a transition metal element ( mainly ni ) have been studied intensively after superconductivity in @xmath12b@xmath0c was discovered in 1994 @xcite . nevertheless , the nature and mechanism of superconductivity in borocarbides which have 3d electronic structure are still under debate .",
    "the most thermodynamic , transport and spectroscopic measurements @xcite give evidence that the superconducting ( sc ) state has an @xmath15-wave symmetry and the pairing is mediated by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "however , for nonmagnetic @xmath13 = lu and y compounds there are several properties mentioned in ref.@xcite , which when taken together , might be interpreted also as hints for unconventional @xmath16-wave or @xmath17-wave superconductivity .",
    "an anisotropic s - wave order parameter ( or s+g model ) was proposed for luni@xmath0b@xmath0c and yni@xmath0b@xmath0c in @xcite .",
    "anyhow , irrespective of the actual order parameter symmetry , there is clear evidence for a notable anisotropy of the sc gap in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite at least on parts of the complex fermi surface @xcite .",
    "using point - contact ( pc ) spectroscopy @xcite both the sc order parameter and the pc electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) function @xmath18 can be determined from the first and second derivatives of the @xmath19 characteristic of pc , respectively .",
    "the measurement of the second derivative of the @xmath19 for pc provides straightforward information as to the pc epi function @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath20 for conducting systems is a touchstone as to phonon - mediated superconductivity , which is governed by the value of the electron - phonon - coupling parameter @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the comparison of the experimentally determined @xmath20 with the calculated one can discriminate different theoretical models and approaches .",
    "thus the pc spectroscopy could be helpful to illuminate details of the epi in @xmath12b@xmath0c as well as to resolve non - phonon quasiparticle interactions .",
    "in addition , the sc gap determines the behavior of the @xmath19 curve of pc at the low biases of a few mv , which is widely used to derive the sc gap from routine fitting by the well - known blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) equations @xcite .",
    "these experimental information as to the sc gap and epi function is very useful for understanding the sc properties and the mechanism of superconductivity for the material under study .    up to",
    "now there are a few papers where yni@xmath0b@xmath0c has been investigated by pc spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the first four papers are devoted to study of the sc gap , while the pc epi spectra for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c were measured and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the main attention there was devoted to study the low energy part of the pc spectra and to so called `` soft '' mode at about 4 - 5mev in the electron - quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "however , the measured pc spectra were featureless above 20mv , although a number of pronounced phonon peaks are well resolved at higher energy by neutron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present more detailed data as to pc epi spectra of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c and as to directional measurements of the sc gap in this compound .",
    "the data were reported on m@xmath22s - htsc conference in dresden ( july 9 - 14 , 2006 ) and partially published in physica c @xcite .",
    "we have used single crystals of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c grown by a floating zone technique with optical heating @xcite . the sample has a residual resistivity of @xmath23 cm and a residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) about 40 .",
    "it becomes superconducting at about 15.4k with a transition width about 0.1k .",
    "pcs were established both along the c axis and along the a axis as well as in the basal plane close to the [ 110 ] direction by standard `` needle - anvil '' or `` shear '' methods @xcite . as a counter electrode cu or ag thin ( @xmath240.15 mm ) wires were used to study the sc gap via the mechanism of andreev reflection .",
    "a series of measurements were done using homocontacts between two pieces of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c . in this case",
    "the orientation of the contact axis with respect to the crystallographic directions was not controlled .",
    "the experimental cell was placed in a flow cryostat , enabling measurements from 1.5k up to @xmath4 and higher .",
    "pcs were created by touching the yni@xmath0b@xmath0c surface by sharpened cu and ag wires directly in the cryostat at liquid helium temperature . to establish homocontacts",
    "two pieces of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c were touched .",
    "an disadvantage of the `` needle  anvil '' method is the sensitivity of the contacts to mechanical vibrations and to change of temperature . as a result , temperature measurements have sustained about a quarter from total in four tens of the contacts investigated at liquid helium temperature .    using a technique of synchronous detection of weak alternating signal harmonics , the first harmonic of the modulating signal @xmath25 ( proportional to the differential resistance @xmath26 ) and the second harmonic @xmath27 ( proportional to @xmath28 )",
    "were recorded as a function of the bias voltage @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 can be expressed as follows : @xmath31 according to the theory of pc spectroscopy @xcite the second derivative @xmath32 of the @xmath19 curve of the ballistic contact at low temperatures is determined by the pc epi function @xmath33 : @xmath34 where e is the electron charge , @xmath16 is the pc diameter and @xmath35 , roughly speaking , reflects strength of the interaction of electrons with phonons .",
    "this interaction underlines the large - angle scattering ( back - scattering ) processes @xcite of electrons in the pc constriction . thus @xmath33 is a kind of transport epi function which selects phonons with a large momentum or umklapp scattering .",
    "the pc diameter @xmath16 , which enters in eq.([pcs ] ) , can be calculated by the wexler @xcite relation : @xmath36 which consists of a sum of ballistic ( sharvin ) and the diffusive ( maxwell ) terms . here",
    "@xmath37e@xmath22 corresponds to the free electron model , where @xmath38 is the fermi momentum and @xmath39 is the density of charge carriers . using data for @xmath40 cm and @xmath41=41 nm from @xcite",
    "the product @xmath42 is about 10@xmath43cm@xmath22 in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c .    from ( [ v2 ] ) and ( [ pcs ] )",
    "@xmath45 can be defined as : @xmath46 that is the measured ac voltage @xmath27 weighted by @xmath47 is directly proportional to the pc epi function @xmath45 .",
    "here it is necessary to mention that the finite temperature @xmath14 and the alternating voltage @xmath25 result in a smearing of the measured @xmath27 spectra .",
    "thus , the infinitely narrow spectral peak smears into a bell - shaped maximum ( see , e.g. @xcite ) with the width @xmath48^{1/2}. \\label{kt}\\ ] ] for example , the smearing of a pc spectrum measured at liquid helium temperature 4.2k and at ac voltage @xmath25 between 1 and 2mv , mainly used in our measurements , is between 2.6 and 4mv .",
    "the pc epi function @xmath49 should vanish above the maximum phonon energy @xmath50 , which is close to the debye energy @xmath51 , because of the lack of phonons with larger energy .",
    "therefore , according to ( [ pcs1 ] ) the pc spectrum @xmath30 should vanish above @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , measured pc spectra always have a nonzero almost constant value above the debye energy , the so - called background .",
    "the general nature of the background was understood by taking into account an accumulation of nonequilibrium phonons in the pc region created by the energized electrons .",
    "the details of the background calculations are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the most often semiempirical formula @xcite @xmath53 is used to describe the background . here for calculations of the energy dependent background an iterative procedure is applied taking as a first approximation for @xmath54 a curve , which continuously increases from zero to the maximal background value at @xmath55 .    in the case of a heterocontact between two metals the pc spectrum represents a sum of the contributions from both metals 1 and 2 weighted by the inverse fermi velocity @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the relative volume occupied by metal 1 in the pc .",
    "thus , using of heterocontacts enables also , e.g. , qualitative estimation of the relative strength of epi in the investigated material as compared to some standard or well known one .    according to the btk theory @xcite of conductivity of n - c - s heterocontacts ( here",
    "n is the normal metal , c is the constriction and s is the superconductor ) a maximum at zero - bias voltage and a double - minimum structure at about @xmath58e in the d@xmath59d@xmath60 curves manifest the andreev reflection processes at the n - s interface with a finite , so called , barrier strength parameter @xmath610 .",
    "the latter has a simple interpretation : it increases normal state resistance of the pc by a factor of ( 1+@xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , as it was mentioned , the minima position in d@xmath59d@xmath60 reflect roughly the sc gap value , which follows from the equations for the @xmath19 characteristics @xcite : @xmath63 where f(@xmath64 ) is the fermi distribution function .",
    "in general , @xmath65 characterizes reflection ( or transmission ) of the n - s interface , which is defined also by the mismatch of the fermi velocity @xmath66 .",
    "thus , even in the absence of a `` natural '' barrier @xmath65 is non zero and is given by @xmath67 the smearing of the experimental @xmath68 curves as compared to the calculated ones according to ( [ btkeq ] ) is usually attributed to quasiparticle dos n(@xmath69 ) broadening in the superconductor due to finite - lifetime . according to dynes et al .",
    "@xcite it can be taken into account by adding an imaginary part to the energy @xmath64 , namely , @xmath64 is replaced by @xmath70 in ( [ btkeq ] ) .",

    "the bottom curve ( measured at 15.1k  slightly below t@xmath75 ) demonstrates these almost suppressed ( sharp kink / peak ) features close to zero bias .",

    "we have selected the pc spectra for which the sc gap varies ( see fig.[y4 ] ) gradually from the maximal value of 2.5mev ( upper spectrum ) to the minimal one of 1.65mev ( bottom spectrum ) . however , no qualitative difference between pc epi spectra is observed .",
    "the spectra show a dominant maximum at about 12mv and a broad shallow maximum or hump centered around 50mv ( fig.[y1 ] ) .",
    "these maxima correspond well to the phonon dos maxima at 12 and 50mv of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c ( see fig.[y2 ] ) obtained by neutron diffraction @xcite . at the same time the pc spectra do not contain contributions from the other phonon maxima at 20 , 24 , 32mv and 100mv observed in the phonon dos . in this context",
    "we should mention that pc spectra of honi@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite display mentioned phonon maxima near 20 , 24 , 32mv .",
    "contrary , the pc spectra of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c above 12mv is monotonic and almost featureless , except of the mentioned 50mv feature . of course , the increase of noise with the voltage hides details of the spectra at higher energies .",
    "note also , that the spectra in fig.[y1 ] are measured in the normal state at 16k where the resolution due to the fermi level smearing is according to ( [ kt ] ) about 8mev which can mask fine features . however , as the upper insert in fig.[y1 ] shows , the spectrum measured at 4.5k ( solid curve ) with the resolution of about 4mev is similar to the other one ( dashed curve ) only it has a little bit sharper maximum at 12mv . even improving resolution below 3mv ( see fig.[y3 ] ) does not recover additional details of the spectra .",
    "it means that the instrumental broadening of the spectra does not play here a crucial role . in this respect",
    "we should note that according to recent data @xcite the strong epi gives rise to pronounced anomalies in the phonon dispersion curves of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c and concurrently to _ large line widths _ of certain phonon modes .",

    "no qualitative difference in the spectra of homo and heterocontacts is seen ( compare spectra in figs.[y1 ] and [ y2 ] ) .",

    "the main reason is that subtraction of the background for pc spectra with a high background level is not a straightforward procedure .",

    "similar to `` soft '' mode maxima are seen in the bottom spectrum in fig.[y1 ] and in the spectrum of 10.5@xmath71-contact in fig.[y2 ] , but they can be attributed to superconductivity which is not fully suppressed in these contacts .",
    "after subtracting the background from the measured pc spectra the epi function is established according to eq.([pcs1 ] ) ( see fig.[y3]b ) and the epi parameter @xmath21 is calculated , which is found to be about 0.1 . however , the calculation of @xmath78 from a pc spectrum is complicated for several reasons .",

    "it is seen that for two pcs with low gap value of about 1mev t@xmath75 is reduced as compared to the bulk one , therefore , a degradation of the sc state at the surface is likely responsible for the low gap value ( @xmath90 1mev ) rather than an anisotropy of the gap .",

    "the observed variation of the gap is such that the small gap ( @xmath1021.5mev ) is characteristic for the direction along the a - axis , while along the c - axis the gap is higher ( @xmath1022.3mev ) and similar or slightly larger gap is measured for the [ 110 ] direction . the directional variation @xmath11 along with the absence of marked anisotropy of pc epi spectra can be an issue of complex multiband ground state in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "multiband scenario for the sc state is also supported by the observation of the small gap and the excess current behavior for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c similar as in the two - gap(band ) superconductor mgb@xmath10 .",
