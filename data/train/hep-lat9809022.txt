    "a quantitative study of the qcd hadronic spectrum should include a study of states with excited orbital angular momentum .",
    "these states generally require non - local operators in order to construct observables with the correct symmetries .",
    "another topic of interest that goes beyond the determination of the ground state spectrum is a study of gluonic mesons : the glueballs and hybrid mesons . of special interest",
    "are the hybrid meson states with @xmath3 quantum numbers that are not allowed in the quark model , the so - called @xmath4 .",
    "these include the @xmath3 values @xmath5 , and @xmath1 .    in the quenched theory , the above mentioned topics",
    "have been investigated by two separate groups @xcite . here",
    "we report on an initial study of hybrid and @xmath6excited mesons in two flavour qcd .",
    "the aim of the study is to study the effects of dynamical quark effects .",
    "a separate study by the milc collaboration using improved actions is also underway @xcite .",
    "in order to construct lattice operators with the desired angular momentum or gluonic excitation , we have to combine representations of the ` spin ' cubic group ( coming from the quark spinors ) with the ` orbital ' cubic group ( coming from the spatial paths ) . following @xcite we study non - local gluonic fields in specific representations of the @xmath7 rotation group .",
    "we work on a @xmath8 lattice at @xmath9 = 5.6 using 2 degenerate wilson fermions .",
    "we use 4 @xmath10 values : 0.1560 , 0.1565 , 0.1570 and 0.1575 , which correspond to @xmath11/@xmath12 = 0.83 , 0.81 , 0.76 , 0.69 respectively . at each @xmath10 value",
    "we have around 200 independent configurations generated as part of the sesam collaboration endeavours . to improve statistics we additionally use a second time source at @xmath1311 .",
    "at each @xmath10 value we generate a set of local propagators consisting of sources for the quark at @xmath14 and at @xmath15 for the anti - quark , where @xmath16 = 1 and 11 . at the source",
    "the propagators are connected by a path @xmath17 consisting of fuzzed gluon links .",
    "the path @xmath17 is chosen to provide the desired angular momentum ( in the case of the @xmath18-excited mesons ) or the gluon excitation ( for the hybrid mesons ) .",
    "the resulting hadronic correlations are therefore also by definition gauge invariant .",
    "fuzzed links are used to improve the overlap with the ground state @xcite .",
    "an alternative procedure to the method used here is to study hybrid mesons using the continuum symmetries @xcite .",
    "= 7.5 cm -1 cm -6 mm",
    "@xmath18-excited mesons can be studied by choosing @xmath17 to be the straight product of fuzzed links connecting the quark and anti - quark at the source and sink . at the source both the direction ( here the z or 3 direction ) and the length ( = 6 )",
    "are fixed . at the sink ,",
    "on the other hand , we have three possible spatial directions , and the length @xmath19 can also be varied .",
    "we perform correlated 2-state fits to the effective mass and use as many operators ( i.e. different spatial link combinations and choices of @xmath19 ) as possible to constrain the fits as much as possible . as a typical example",
    "we show the results for the @xmath20 meson in fig .",
    "[ a1 ] .",
    "we are also able to determine the hyperfine splitting among the four states in the @xmath21wave multiplet , finding that the singlet state has the lowest mass , while the other three members have masses which are degenerate within the statistical errors .",
    "similar behaviour was observed in the quenched theory @xcite .",
    "hybrid mesons are by definition mesons with an excited gluonic component . from studies of static quarks",
    "it was found that the lowest lying hybrid states have colour flux from the quark to anti - quark excited in a transverse spatial plane  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by the choice of u - shaped paths of fuzzed links at the source and sink .",
    "these operators were also successfully used in a study of lighter quark masses in quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "the lowest lying gluonic excitations have spatial symmetries corresponding to @xmath22 = @xmath23 and @xmath22 = @xmath2 . combining these with the @xmath24 spin representations ,",
    "we obtain a range of possible @xmath3 values which include the spin - exotic quantum numbers @xmath0 , and @xmath1 which are not present in the quark model .      in our simulation",
    "the source necessarily again has longitudinal length ( @xmath25 ) = 6 fixed , while the transverse length ( @xmath26 ) is free . at the sink one can vary both ( @xmath19 and @xmath27 respectively ) . from earlier experience we found that the optimum choice of operators has ( @xmath28)=(6,6 ) at the source , while at the sink we use ( @xmath29 ) = ( 1,1 ) , ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) .",
    "the choice of ( 6,6 ) at both source and sink moreover gives an upper bound on the ground state mass .",

    "is again found to be the lightest state .",
    "this result is also found by the milc investigation @xcite . in order to convert the results into physical units we use @xmath36 gev determined from @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these values are given in the last column in tab .",
    "[ res ] .",
    "the estimate for the @xmath2 state agrees  within the given statistical uncertainty  with the value obtained in the quenched theory .",
    "one reason for this might be that the lattice volume ( @xmath37 1.4 fm ) is too small  the wave function of hybrid mesons is expected to be large .",
    "to investigate these finite volume effects a calculation of the hybrid spectrum on a @xmath38 lattice is currently under way .        in fig .",
    "[ order ] we show the ordering of the hybrid meson levels .",
    "the dashed lines represent @xmath18-excited states .",
    "the strong mixing of the hybrid mesons and standard mesons ( i.e. with no gluonic excitation ) with the same @xmath3 values , already seen in the quenched approximation , is also apparent here . in full qcd",
    "there are also other mixing effects : even exotic mesons can now mix with 4q ( @xmath39 ) states ( e.g. @xmath40 ) .",
    "these effects are currently under investigation .",
    "we are also planning to implement a third time source to reduce the statistical errors of the results presented above ."
