    "the recent experimental realization of graphene,@xcite a single - layer carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , has generated a great attention in the condensed matter community.@xcite graphene has an unique band structure with a linear dispersion relation of the low - lying excitations , which leads to many peculiar properties,@xcite such as its quasi - particles obeying the dirac - like equation and having the relativistic - like behaviors with zero rest mass , the hall plateaus having the half - integer values @xmath3 with the degeneracy @xmath4 . for the neutral graphene ,",
    "its fermi level passes through the dirac points , the six corners of the hexagonal first brillouin zone . by varying the gate voltage ,",
    "the charge carriers of graphene can be easily tuned experimentally .",
    "then the fermi level can be above or below the dirac points .",
    "very recently , some works have begun to investigate the transport behaviors of the graphene - superconductor junctions.@xcite while a metal coupled to a superconductor , the andreev reflection occurs in the interface between the metal and superconductor,@xcite in which the interface reflects an electron incident from the normal metal side as a hole and a cooper pair is created in the superconductor . for a bias below the superconductor gap , the andreev reflection determines the conductance of the metal - superconductor junction since the normal tunneling can not occur . in the usual metal - superconductor junction ,",
    "the andreev reflected hole retraces the path of the incident electron , so this andreev reflection is also called andreev retroreflection .",
    "but for the graphene - superconductor junction , beenakker recently found that a new kind of reflection ( specular andreev reflection ) occurs while the incident electron and reflected hole are at the conduction and valence bands , respectively.@xcite afterwards , many papers have studied the graphene and superconductor hybrid system , including the graphene - based normal - superconductor ( n - s),@xcite s - n - s,@xcite s - insulator - s,@xcite s - ferromagnet - s,@xcite and etc .",
    "several other effects due to the coupling of graphene and superconductor , such as josephson effect@xcite and multiple andreev reflection processes,@xcite have been theoretically analyzed .",
    "on the experimental side , good contacts between the superconductor electrodes and graphene have been realized,@xcite and the josephson current through a s - graphene - s junctions has been measured .",
    "a finite supercurrent was observed at zero charge density .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out theoretical study of the transport characteristics of a graphene nanoribbon - superconductor junction .",
    "there are four new aspects beyond the previous studies : ( i ) we study the system consisting of a graphene nanoribbon with a finite width coupled to the superconductor electrode .",
    "the previous theoretical papers only consider the infinite - wide graphene - superconductor junction or a graphene strip between two superconductor leads with the strip width much larger than the strip length . on the experiment side ,",
    "the graphene nanoribbon has been successfully fabricated , and the width of the nanoribbon can be in the order of ten or sub - ten nanometers.@xcite ( ii ) in our model , the graphene nanoribbon is directly coupled to the superconductor electrode , and the incident electrons from the graphene are allowed to enter into the superconductor electrode as the cooper pairs . in the previous papers , those authors only considered a pair potential in the graphene induced by depositing of a superconductor electrode on top of the graphene sheet .",
    "( iii ) we consider a perpendicular magnetic field applied to the graphene , as was done in a recent experiment.@xcite on the superconductor side , the magnetic field vanishes due to the meissner effect .",
    "( iv ) the effect of disorder on the transport property is investigated since in a real graphene sample , the disorder is always there to a certain degree .",
    "in fact , in the previous studies , the effects of disorder and magnetic field are thus far neglected .    by using the tight binding model and the nonequilibrium green function method ,",
    "the current and andreev reflection coefficient are obtained .",
    "both zigzag edge and armchair edge graphene nanoribbons are considered . for the zigzag edge and at a zero magnetic field , the linear conductance exhibits step structures for the narrow graphene ribbon . with a magnetic field , the conductance depends strongly on the system parameters . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the linear conductance shows plateaus at a high magnetic field . on the other hand , for the armchair edge , a zero - conductance region emerges because of the existence of an energy gap in the graphene nanoribbon .",
    "this zero conductance is robust against disorder .",
    "in addition , we also consider a finite - bias case , in which the andreev reflection coefficient and normal tunneling coefficient are investigated .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the model for graphene nanoribbon - superconductor junction is presented and the formalisms for calculating the current and the andreev reflection coefficient are derived . in section iii and iv , we study the linear conductance and the transport with a finite bias , respectively . finally , a brief summary is presented in section v.",
    "we consider the system consisting of a graphene nanoribbon coupled to a superconductor lead ( as shown in fig.1 ) with the hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the hamiltonians of the graphene region , superconductor lead , and coupling of the graphene and superconductor lead , respectively . for a semi - infinite graphene nanoribbon , @xmath9 in the tight - binding representation is of the form:@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the annihilation and creation operators at the discrete site @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the on - site energy which can be controlled by the gate voltage in an experiment .",
    "two kinds of edges , zigzag and armchair , are considered ( see fig.1a and 1b ) .",
    "the graphene ribbon is divided into two regions .",
    "the left - side of the semi - infinite region is without disorder and @xmath15 there .",
    "the disorder exists only in the center region of the graphene - nanoribbon ( see the box with the dotted - line in fig.1 ) .",
    "here we consider the on - site disorder causing by the nonmagnetic impurities or by the random potential difference of the substrate . due to the disorder , the on - site energy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the on - site disorder energy and @xmath17 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath18 $ ] with @xmath19 being the disorder strength .",
    "the size of the disorder region is described by the width @xmath20 and length @xmath21 . in fig.1a and 1b , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the second term in eq.(2 ) is the nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "when the graphene ribbon is under a uniform perpendicular magnetic field @xmath26 , a phase @xmath27 is added in the hopping elements , and @xmath28 with the vector potential @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "experimentally , it is possible to have the superconductor electrode in a good contact with the graphene.@xcite the electrons from the graphene can easily enter into the superconductor electrode as the cooper pairs or vice versa .",
    "so we consider that the graphene nanoribbon is directly coupled to the superconductor electrode .",
    "the superconductor electrode is described by a continuum model and it does not have the honeycomb structure of the graphene . then the hamiltonian @xmath7 is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the annihilation and creation operators in the superconductor lead with the momentum @xmath34 . here",
    "we consider the s - wave superconductor and @xmath35 is the superconductor gap .",
    "the superconductor region is without the magnetic field due to the meissner effect or that the magnetic field is only added in the graphene region .",

    "in this section , we consider the small bias limit and investigate the linear conductance .",
    "when the bias @xmath60 is smaller than the gap @xmath35 , the normal tunneling processes can not occur and @xmath103 for @xmath104 . then only andreev reflection processes contribute to the current , and the linear conductance @xmath105 at zero temperature . in the following ,",
    "we carry out numerical studies of graphene nanoribbons with both zigzag and armchair edges .",

    "the charge carrier of graphene is hole - like , and it is electron - like for @xmath110 . in the absence of a magnetic field ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "the conductance @xmath107 is approximately linear with @xmath112 due to the linear increasing of the carrier density . for a narrow graphene nanoribbon ( e.g. @xmath113 )",
    ", the conductance @xmath107 clearly shows the step structures because of the sub - bands from the finite width .",
    "when a sub - band passes through the fermi energy @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , a step appears . for @xmath113 , the width of the graphene ribbon",
    "is @xmath116 .",
    "the graphene ribbon with this width has been realized in a recent experiment.@xcite on the other hand , for a wide graphene nanoribbon ( e.g. @xmath117 ) , the step structures faint away due to the reduction of the interval of the sub - bands .",
    "while in the presence of a strong magnetic field , the conductance @xmath107 does not show a clear pattern and depends strongly on @xmath108 and the width @xmath20 ( see fig.2b ) . raising the disorder from zero , the conductance @xmath107 in the small - value region",
    "is increased while @xmath107 in the large - value region is decreased ( as shown fig.3 ) , meanwhile some plateaus emerge at moderate disorder strength , e.g @xmath118.@xcite these plateaus origin from the mixture of the electron and hole edge states , which will be discussed in detail in the last paragraph in this sub - section .",
    "fig.4 shows the linear conductance @xmath107 versus the on - site energy @xmath108 with a moderate disorder strength @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath107 exhibits the plateaus with or without a magnetic field . in absence of the magnetic field ,",
    "the conductance @xmath107 is similar to the disorder - free case ( compare fig.2a and fig.4a ) , and the plateaus of the conductance are equal - spaced in energy .",
    "these plateaus are from the discrete sub - bands . in a graphene sample , due to the linear dispersion relation ,",
    "the sub - bands are equal - spaced , so are the plateaus . for a wider graphene ribbon , the sub - bands are closer , then the width of the plateaus are smaller , so that the plateaus are fainted at large width ( e.g. @xmath117 ) . on the other hand , in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the width of conductance plateaus are independent to the width @xmath20 of the graphene ribbon , and the plateaus are always clear regardless of @xmath20 .",
    "now the plateaus are equal - spaced in the scale of @xmath119 , and the values of the conductance plateaus are determined by the filling factors @xmath1 of the landau level and the width @xmath20 of the graphene ribbon .",

    "in which the andreev reflection occurs .",
    "so the wider the graphene ribbon is , the larger the probability is for the andreev reflection . in the large @xmath20 limit ,",
    "the electron and hole edge states are well mixed , thus , the andreev reflection coefficient is @xmath2 , independent of any system parameters , such as the width @xmath20 , the on - site energy @xmath108 , the magnetic field strength @xmath100 , and the disorder strength @xmath19",
    ". then the conductance @xmath122 .      in this sub - section , the linear conductance @xmath107 in the armchair edge case is numerically investigated .",
    "fig.6 shows the conductance @xmath107 versus the on - site energy @xmath108 . without a magnetic field ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "@xmath107 increases linearly with the energy @xmath112 in the absence of disorder ( see fig.6a ) .",
    "the disorder evidently enhances the conductance @xmath107 in the small @xmath112 region ( see fig.6b ) , thus , @xmath107 departs from the linear relation with @xmath112 .",

    "this zero conductance @xmath107 region still exists in the presence of disorder ( e.g. @xmath118 ) .",
    "( ii ) the step structures from the sub - bands are not apparent , although the width of the graphene ribbon is @xmath126 for @xmath117 . for the zigzag edge case with this width the step structures",
    "are clearly seen ( see fig.2a and fig.4a ) .    with a magnetic field",
    ", the landau levels are formed and the conductance @xmath107 departs completely from the linear relation with @xmath112 . for the clean system ( @xmath106 ) ,",
    "the conductance is quite small at the smallest filling factor @xmath127 , and exhibits some peaks at the higher filling factors @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , etc ( see fig.6c ) . on the other hand , in the presence of disorder ( @xmath118 ) , the conductance @xmath107 shows plateaus and the plateau values are @xmath131 in the large width @xmath20 limit .",
    "this is because of the mixture of the electron and hole edge states and the andreev reflection coefficient is @xmath2 at large @xmath20 .",
    "the characteristics of the plateaus at the moderate disorder strength are similar to that of the zigzag edge graphene ribbon .",
    "fig.7 shows the conductance @xmath107 versus the width @xmath20 of the graphene ribbon for a moderate disorder strength . at zero magnetic field ,",
    "the conductance @xmath107 increases linearly with the width @xmath20 as appears in a classical system .",
    "but at a high magnetic field , although the conductance @xmath107 still increases with the width , a saturation value @xmath132 appears , same as in the zigzag edge case .",
    "in this section , the case with a finite bias is investigated . with the bias @xmath133 ,",
    "the normal tunneling processes also occur , and the current @xmath65 is : @xmath134 following , we numerically study the normal tunneling coefficient @xmath135 and andreev reflection coefficient @xmath136 for the zigzag edge graphene ribbon .",
    "fig.8 shows @xmath135 and @xmath136 versus the energy @xmath79 of the incident electron for the clean system .",
    "the normal tunneling coefficient @xmath135 is zero when @xmath104 because of the superconductor gap , and @xmath135 is near 1 at @xmath137 since there is no barrier at the interface of the superconductor and graphene .",
    "next , we focus on the andreev reflection coefficient @xmath136 . for zero magnetic field with @xmath111 , @xmath136 is almost zero for @xmath138 ( see fig.8a ) , implying that the specular andreev reflection is very weak at @xmath111 .",
    "but the usual andreev retroreflection still occurs , and @xmath136 is quite large for @xmath139 . with a magnetic field ( see fig.8c ) , both kinds of andreev reflections occur simultaneously , and @xmath136 is always finite regardless whether @xmath139 or @xmath140 .",
    "@xmath136 has a peak at @xmath141 and quickly decays for @xmath137 , which is similar to a normal metal - superconductor junction.@xcite    finally , the effect of the disorder on the normal tunneling coefficient @xmath135 and andreev reflection coefficient @xmath136 are studied .",
    "the normal tunneling coefficient @xmath135 is almost unaffected by a moderate disorder strength @xmath19 , @xmath135 is still zero for @xmath104 and near 1 for @xmath137 ( see fig.9b and 9d ) .",
    "however , the andreev reflection coefficient @xmath136 is evidently affected by the disorder ( see fig.9a and 9c ) . both specular andreev reflection and",
    "the usual andreev retroreflection occur , and @xmath136 is close to 0.5 in the whole range of @xmath104 .",
    "in summary , by using the non - equilibrium green s function method , the electron transport through the graphene nanoribbon - superconductor junction is investigated . both zigzag and armchair edge graphene nanoribbons are considered .",
    "the effects of a magnetic field and disorder on the transport property are discussed . in the clean system and without a magnetic field ,",
    "the linear conductance increases approximatively in a linear fashion with the on - site energy for the case with the armchair edge or the wide zigzag edge . in the presence of a magnetic field and moderate disorder",
    ", the linear conductance exhibits the plateau structures for both armchair and zigzag edge nanoribbons .",
    "the plateau value increases with the width of the graphene ribbon , but reaches a saturation at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the filling factor ) for the wide graphene ribbon .",
    "in addition , the case with a finite bias is studied , and the dependence of the andreev reflection and normal tunneling coefficients on the energy of the incident electron are discussed .",
