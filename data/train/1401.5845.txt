    "charmonium production has long been considered as a clean probe for the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) matter formed in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energy  @xcite , due to the color screening of heavy quark potential at finite temperature  @xcite . when the temperature of the medium becomes higher than the charmonium dissociation temperature @xmath4 , the initially produced charmonia will be destroyed .",
    "it is called the anomalous suppression  @xcite .",
    "therefore the comparison of the final yield of charmonia from heavy ion collisions to that from the corresponding nucleon - nucleon collisions can be used to extract the medium properties in high - energy nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "this anomalous suppression induced by the hot nuclear matter effect explains well the experimentally observed charmonium suppression at the super proton synchrotron ( sps )  @xcite . however , color screening is not the only hot medium effect in high - energy nuclear collisions . once the energy is sufficiently high , such as the collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ,",
    "many charm quarks are produced  @xcite .",
    "the initially uncorrelated charm quarks @xmath5 and @xmath6 can recombine into a charmonium . this process is called regeneration  @xcite . in high - energy nuclear collisions , these two effects are co - existing and their relative strength is energy dependent . at rhic",
    "it turns out that both suppression and regeneration processes are important for understanding the charmonium production  @xcite .    even before the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , the cold nuclear matter effects affect the charmonium production . usually three effects are considered in the literatures : ( 1 ) the change in the parton distribution function in nucleus which controls the initial parton behavior and strongly depends on the collision kinematics . in the small @xmath7 region , the nuclear parton distribution function",
    "is clearly suppressed compared to that of nucleon .",
    "that is called the shadowing effect  @xcite ; ( 2 ) cronin effect  @xcite which describes the initial gluon multi - scattering with the nucleons prior to any hard scattering and the quarkonium formation .",
    "the nature of such collisions can be described as brownian motion . as a result the transverse momentum distribution of the produced charmonia is broadened ; and ( 3 ) nuclear absorption via interaction between charmonia and the primary nucleons which leads to the normal suppression of charmonia  @xcite . both cronin effect and nuclear absorption",
    "have been studied in p+a collisions  @xcite , while a deep understanding of shadowing effect requires e+p and e+a collisions . in order to understand the charmonium production and",
    "extract properties of the medium created in high - energy nuclear collisions , one must take into account both cold and hot nuclear matter effects .",
    "lhc provides new data on the charmonium production in pb+pb collisions at colliding energy @xmath8 tev  @xcite . at lhc",
    "the initially produced charmonia are strongly suppressed by the hotter , larger and longer lived fireball , hence the regeneration becomes the dominant production source .",
    "different from rhic where the parton longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath9 is located in the interface between shadowing and anti - shadowing  @xcite regions and therefore the shadowing and anti - shadowing effect is not yet very strong ( the ratio of parton distribution function in a+a and p+p collisions is between 0.96 and 1.08 for charmonium transverse momentum @xmath10 gev / c , see fig.7 of ref.@xcite ) , the collisions at lhc with much smaller @xmath7 are in the strong shadowing region  @xcite , and the shadowing effect plays an important role in the study of charmonium production .    in the present study , we will extend our detailed transport approach for charmonium motion in qgp to self - consistently including both the cold and hot nuclear matter effects , and apply it to the charmonium production at lhc energy .",
    "the suppression and regeneration mechanisms in the hot medium are reviewed in section [ s2 ] , and the shadowing effect , the gaussian smearing treatment for the cronin effect , and the initial charmonium distribution are focused in section [ s3 ] .",
    "the comparison between the theoretical calculations and the experimental data are shown in section [ s4 ] .",
    "we summarize our study in section [ s4 ] .",
    "in order to extract information about the nature of the medium from charmonium production in heavy ion collisions , the medium created in the initial stage and the charmonia produced in the initial stage and in the medium should be treated both dynamically .",
    "we employ the well tested 2 + 1 dimensional version  @xcite of the ideal hydrodynamic equations @xmath11 to simulate the evolution of the almost baryon - free medium created at rhic and lhc , where @xmath12 is the energy - momentum tensor of the medium .",
    "the solution of the hydrodynamic equations provides the local temperature and fluid velocity of the medium which will be used in the charmonium regeneration and suppression .    to close the hydrodynamical equations one needs to know the equation of state of the medium .",
    "we follow ref.@xcite where the deconfined phase at high temperature is an ideal gas of gluons and massless @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks plus 150 mev massed @xmath15 quarks , and the hadron phase at low temperature is an ideal gas of all known hadrons and resonances with mass up to 2 gev  @xcite .",
    "there is a first order phase transition between these two phases . in the mixed phase",
    ", the maxwell construction is used .",
    "the mean field repulsion parameter and the bag constant are chosen as @xmath16=450 mev @xmath17 and @xmath18=236 mev to obtain the critical temperature @xmath19 mev  @xcite at vanishing baryon number density .",
    "taking the initialization in ref .",
    "@xcite for the hydrodynamic equations , we get the maximum temperature @xmath20 and @xmath21 mev of the medium at the initial time @xmath22 fm / c , corresponding respectively to the observed charge number density @xmath23 in mid rapidity and @xmath24 in forward rapidity by the alice collaboration  @xcite .    since a charmonium is so heavy , its equilibrium with the medium can hardly be reached , one usually uses a transport approach to describe the charmonium motion in the medium .",
    "the charmonium distribution function @xmath25 in the phase space @xmath26 at time @xmath27 in heavy ion collisions with impact parameter @xmath28 is controlled by the boltzmann - type equation @xmath29 considering the contribution from the feed - down of the excited states @xmath30 and @xmath31 to the finally observed @xmath2  @xcite , we should take into account the transport equations for all the charmonium states @xmath32 and @xmath31 , when we calculate the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "the lose and gain terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 describe the charmonium dissociation and regeneration , and the elastic scattering is neglected since the charmonium mass is much larger than the typical medium temperature . introducing proper time @xmath35 , space rapidity @xmath36 $ ] ,",

    "considering the gluon dissociation @xmath46 as the dominant dissociation process in the hot qgp , @xmath47 can be calculated by the gluon momentum integration of the dissociation cross section @xmath48 multiplied by the thermal gluon distribution @xmath49 and the flux factor @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the gluon energy , the cross section @xmath48 in vacuum can be derived through the operator production expansion with perturbative coulomb wave function  @xcite , and the cross section at finite temperature is estimated by taking the geometrical relation between the cross section and the average size of the charmonium state , @xmath53 .",
    "the averaged radius square @xmath54 for the bound state @xmath42 can be obtained from the potential model  @xcite , its divergence self - consistently defines a mott dissociation temperature @xmath4 which indicates the melting of the bound state due to color screening .",
    "the local temperature @xmath55 and the fluid velocity @xmath56 of the medium in the cross section and the gluon thermal distribution come from the solution of the ideal hydrodynamic equations ( [ hydro ] ) .",
    "the regeneration cross section is connected to the dissociation cross section @xmath48 via the detailed balance between the gluon dissociation and reversed process  @xcite . to obtain the regeneration rate @xmath57 ,",
    "we need also the charm quark distribution @xmath58 in the medium . from the experimental data at rhic and lhc ,",
    "the observed large quench factor  @xcite and elliptic flow  @xcite for charmed mesons indicate that the charm quarks interact strongly with the medium .",
    "therefore , one can reasonably take , as a good approximation , a kinetically thermalized phase space distribution @xmath59 for charm quarks , @xmath60 . neglecting the creation and annihilation for charm - anticharm pairs inside the medium , the spacial density of charm ( anti - charm ) quark number",
    "@xmath61 satisfies the conservation law @xmath62 with the initial density determined by the nuclear geometry @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the thickness functions at transverse coordinate @xmath66 defined in the glauber model  @xcite , and @xmath67 is the rapidity distribution of charm quark production cross section in p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for the charmonium transport equation ( [ trans2 ] ) can be obtained from a geometrical superposition of p+p collisions , along with the modification from the cold nuclear matter effect . for the charmonium production ,",
    "the cold nuclear matter effect includes usually the nuclear shadowing  @xcite , cronin effect  @xcite and nuclear absorption  @xcite . at lhc energy ,",
    "the collision time for two heavy nuclei to pass through each other is much shorter than the charmonium formation time and the qgp formation time , and one can safely neglect the nuclear absorption and just take into account the nuclear shadowing and cronin effect .",
    "the cronin effect broadens the momentum of the initially produced charmonia in heavy ion collisions . before two gluons fuse into a charmonium",
    ", they acquire additional transverse momentum via multi - scattering with the around nucleons , and this extra momentum would be inherited by the produced charmonium . inspired from a random - walk picture , we take a gaussian smearing@xcite for the modified transverse momentum distribution @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the path length of the two gluons in nuclei before their fusion into a charmonium at @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the longitudinal coordinates of the two nucleons where the two gluons come from , @xmath74 is the averaged charmonium transverse momentum square obtained from the gluon scattering with a unit of length of nucleons , and @xmath75 is the momentum distribution for a free p+p collision .",
    "the length @xmath76 is calculated from the nuclear geometry , and the cronin parameter @xmath74 is usually extracted from corresponding p+a collisions where the produced charmonia suffer from only cold nuclear matter effect . considering the absence of p+a data at lhc energy , we take @xmath77 gev@xmath78/fm from empirical estimations  @xcite .    assuming that the emitted gluon in the gluon fusion process @xmath79 is soft in comparison with the initial gluons and the produced charmonium and can be neglected in kinematics , corresponding to the picture of color evaporation model at leading order  @xcite , the longitudinal momentum fractions of the two initial gluons are calculated from the momentum conservation , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the charmonium rapidity .",
    "the free distribution @xmath82 can be obtained by integrating the elementary partonic processes , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the gluon distribution in a free proton , @xmath85 is the emitted gluon s rapidity , @xmath86 is the charmonium momentum distribution produced from a fusion process , and @xmath87 is the factorization scale of the fusion process .",
    "now we consider the shadowing effect .",
    "the distribution function @xmath88 for parton @xmath89 in a nucleus differs from a superposition of the distribution @xmath90 in a free nucleon .",
    "the nuclear shadowing can be described by the modification factor @xmath91 . to account for the spatial dependence of the shadowing in a finite nucleus",
    ", one assumes that the inhomogeneous shadowing is proportional to the parton path length through the nucleus  @xcite , which amounts to consider the coherent interaction of the incident parton with all the target partons along its path length .",
    "therefore , we replace the homogeneous modification factor @xmath92 by an inhomogeneous one @xmath93  @xcite @xmath94 with the definition @xmath95 .",
    "we employ in the following the eks98 package  @xcite to evaluate the homogeneous ratio @xmath96 , and the factorization scale is taken as @xmath97 .",
    "replacing the free distribution @xmath49 in ( [ fg ] ) by the modified distribution @xmath98 and taking into account the cronin effect ( [ cronin ] ) , we finally get the initial charmonium distribution for the transport equation ( [ trans2 ] ) , @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the nucleon distribution functions in the two colliding nuclei .",
    "now the only thing left is the distribution @xmath102 in a free p+p collision which can be fixed by data or by some empirical estimations .    since the charmonia in heavy ion collisions at lhc",

    "we have seen the strong competition between the charmonium suppression and regeneration in the centrality dependence of the @xmath2 yield . in order to see the charmonium production and suppression mechanisms more clearly in heavy ion collisions , we turn to the transverse momentum dependence of the yield .",

    "since bottom quarks are so heavy , their thermalization is unreasonable in nuclear collisions .",
    "while the total @xmath2 yield shown in fig.[fig3 ] is not sensitive to the bottom quark transverse momentum distribution , it may change remarkably the @xmath2 yield in a fixed @xmath111 bin , especially in a high @xmath111 bin where the bottom quark energy loss becomes important .",
    "inspired from the cms measurement  @xcite , we apply a b quench factor @xmath146 when calculating the non - prompt @xmath2s in the region of @xmath147 gev / c .",
    "heavy quarks are produced via hard scatterings and their initial momentum distribution is hard . through interation with the medium ,",
    "heavy quarks lose energy , and the corresponding @xmath148 distribution becomes steeper .",
    "since the medium is hot and dense , some of the charm quarks are even thermalized .",
    "considering that the regenerated charmonia from thermalized charm quarks in hot medium are mainly distributed in low momentum region , their contribution to the yield decreases with increasing transverse momentum , and therefore the band structure for the total result due to the uncertainty in regeneration disappears in the high @xmath111 bins @xmath147 gev / c and @xmath121 gev / c , see figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "as we have pointed out that the flat platform for semi - central and central collisions comes from the competition between the suppression and regeneration , it vanishes in the high @xmath111 bins due to the disappearance of the regeneration .",
    "the yield in high @xmath111 bins is characterized by the debye screening effect on the initially produced charmonia . in this case",
    ", there exists a kink for the nuclear modification factor which is located at @xmath149 ( fig.4 ) for @xmath147 gev / c at forward rapidity and @xmath150 ( fig.5 ) for @xmath121 gev / c in mid rapidity . before the kink , the temperature of the fireball is less than the @xmath2 dissociation temperature @xmath151 and there is @xmath152 , resulted from the fact that the decay contribution from the excited charmonium states to the finally observed @xmath2s is about @xmath153 .",
    "starting at the kink , the temperature is higher than @xmath151 and the @xmath2 suppression becomes more and more important in more central collisions .",
    "as one can see from figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , the kink at mid rapidity appears at a lower value of @xmath139 than that at forward - rapidity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the medium at mid rapidity is hotter and @xmath2 starts to melt at more peripheral collisions .",
    "the model results underestimate the high @xmath154 results a bit , see figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "part of the discrepancy may due to the fact we have not include the velocity dependence of the dissociation temperature . as discussed in  @xcite , fast moving charmonia tend to be melt at a higher temperature making the velocity dependence particularly important in high @xmath154 regions .       nuclear modification factor as a function of transverse momentum for 2.76 tev pb+pb collisions at forward rapidity and in different centrality bins .",

    "initially produced @xmath2s ( dot - dashed lines ) become important at high @xmath154 region .",
    "therefore , the competition between the suppression and regeneration depends strongly on the transverse momentum and collision centralities .",

    "note that without the regeneration as the second production source , the nuclear modification factor @xmath137 would decrease monotonously with increasing centrality and increases monotonously with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath156 for prompt @xmath2s at mid rapidity is shown in fig.[fig7 ] . while the cms data are in the high @xmath111 region where there is almost no contribution from the regeneration and the system",

    ", we assumed a thermalized charm quark distribution for the calculation of the regeneration rate , how good is this assumption and how does the charm quark thermalization affect the charmonium distribution ?",
    "the other question is how to separate the hot nuclear matter effect from the cold nuclear matter effect . to focus on the property of the hot medium , we hope to have a quantity which is sensitive to the hot nuclear matter effect but affected weekly by the cold nuclear matter effect . to these ends",
    ", we introduced a new nuclear modification factor for the transverse momentum  @xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are averaged transverse momentum square for @xmath2 in a+a and p+p collisions , respectively . to be different from the usually used nuclear modification factor @xmath137 for the yield",
    ", we take here @xmath3 as the ratio of the second moment of transverse momentum distributions .",
    "since the nuclear matter effect changes not only the size of the transverse momentum but also its shape , we focus on @xmath162 instead of @xmath163 .",
    "it is worthy to note that the second moment of the @xmath154 distribution is also sensitive to the cronin effect but not much affected by the parton distribution functions .",
    "the calculation and the comparison with experimental data at sps , rhic and lhc energies are shown in fig.[fig8 ] for two rapidity bins . in mid rapidity where the hot nuclear matter effect is most important , the ratio changes significantly with increasing colliding energy , @xmath164 see the upper panel of fig.[fig8 ] . at sps ,",
    "almost all the measured @xmath2s are produced through initial hard processes and carry high momentum .",
    "the continuous increasing with centrality arises from the cronin effect and leakage effect  @xcite .",
    "the latter is described by the third term on the left hand side of the transport equation ( [ trans2 ] ) and means that the high @xmath111 @xmath2s can escape from the hot medium . at rhic ,",
    "the regeneration starts to play a role and even becomes equally important as the initial production in central collisions  @xcite , the cancelation between the suppression and regeneration leads to a flat @xmath3 around unity . at lhc ,",
    "the regeneration becomes dominant , especially in central collisions . since the regenerated charmonia carry low momentum in comparison with the initial production , the more and more important regeneration results in a decreasing @xmath3 with increasing centrality .",
    "this tremendous change in the @xmath111 ratio comes from the nature of the hot medium at each corresponding collision energy .",
    "our calculation agrees well with the data at sps and rhic energies . at lhc energy",
    "there are currently no data at mid rapidity .",
    "the band structure at lhc is again from the uncertainty in the charm quark production cross section .",
    "note that , different from the ratio @xmath137 for the yield where the lower and higher borders of the band correspond to the smaller and larger cross sections , the relation between the two borders of @xmath3 and the cross section is in an opposite way , namely , the lower and higher borders here correspond to the larger and smaller cross sections . intuitively this is simple to understand : in the case of larger charm quark cross section , more @xmath2s are from the regeneration and then carry low momentum . to have a comparison with the lhc data , we calculated the ratio @xmath3 in the forward rapidity where the hot medium effect becomes weaker .",
    "in this case the trend of the ratio is still very different at rhic and lhc : with increasing centrality it goes up at rhic but drops down at lhc .",

    "the calculation agrees well with both the rhic and lhc data .",
    "for @xmath2s as a function of centrality at sps , rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the bands at lhc are due to the uncertainty in the charm quark cross section @xmath166 mb at forward rapidity ( lower panel ) and @xmath167 mb at mid rapidity ( upper panel ) , and the data are from na50  @xcite , phenix  @xcite and alice  @xcite collaborations . ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]     for @xmath2s as a function of centrality at lhc energy and at forward rapidity .",
    "the upper and lower panels are the comparisons between pqcd and thermal charm quark distributions and between with and without shadowing effect .",
    "the bands are again due to the uncertainty in the charm quark cross section @xmath166 mb , and the data are from the alice collaboration  @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    after a careful inspecting the centrality dependence of @xmath3 , one can find a common feature in all cases , namely , @xmath3 in peripheral collisions is always increasing as the centrality increases . in case",
    "the initial production is dominant , the ratio continues to increase , while strong regeneration from thermalized charm quarks pulls the ratio down below unity in more central collisions . in order to see",
    "if charm quarks are thermalized with the hot medium , we calculate now the ratio @xmath3 at lhc energy with a pqcd simulated charm quark distribution , shown in the upper panel of fig.[fig9 ] at forward rapidity .",
    "the thermal distribution is the limit of strong interaction between charm quarks and the medium , while the pqcd distribution taken from the simulator pythia  @xcite is the limit of no interaction . for the pqcd distribution , the charm quark energy loss",
    "is excluded , the initially produced charm quarks keep their high momentum in the medium , and therefore the regenerated charmonia will be no longer soft but carry high momentum . in this case , the averaged transverse momentum is enhanced at the forward rapidity and the ratio @xmath3 becomes larger than the one with thermal distribution , see the upper panel of fig.[fig9 ] . again",
    "the band is due to the uncertainty in the charm quark cross section . from the comparison with the alice data ,",
    "we conclude that charm quarks are thermalized in high - energy nuclear collisions at the lhc energy .    in the above calculations we have taken a reduction of @xmath136 for the charm and bottom quark distributions in the medium , due to the shadowing effect .",
    "this reduction leads to an extra charmonium suppression . supposing the total number of initially produced charm quarks is @xmath168 , the regenerated charmonium number is then proportional to @xmath169 if we do not take into account the shadowing effect and @xmath170 when the shadowing effect is included .",
    "however , the averaged transverse momentum square @xmath162 is a normalized quantity , it should not be so sensitive to the shadowing effect .",
    "the comparison between the calculations with and without considering the shadowing effect is shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "as we expected , the two bands are very close to each other and overlap partly .",
    "this indicates that the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 for charmonium transverse momentum can be used to extract the hot medium information with only small correction from the early shadowing effect .       for prompt ( upper panel ) and inclusive ( lower panel ) @xmath2s in @xmath8 tev pb+pb collisions .",
    "the calculation is with impact parameter @xmath171 fm , corresponding to the minimum bias event .",
    "the dot - dashed , dashed and solid lines represent the initial , regeneration and total contributions . in the lower panel ,",
    "the thick and thin lines indicate the total results including thermal bottom decay and pqcd bottom decay , respectively .",
    "the experimental data are taken from alice experiment  @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    since the elliptic flow originates from the geometric anisotropy in the configuration space and develops in the evolution of the hot medium , it is significant in semi - central collisions and approaches to zero in peripheral and central collisions . as far as the charmonium concern , those that produced from the initial collisions prior to the formation of the hot medium will not present any significant elliptic flow , see the dot - dashed line in the upper panel of fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "the regenerated @xmath2s , on the other hand , may inherit flow from the thermalized charm quarks , as shown by the dashed line . through interactions , the initial anisotropy in the configuration space",
    "is converted into the anisotropy in momentum space for all final hadrons .",
    "the full @xmath2 @xmath172 is shown as the solid line in the upper panel of fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "note that a sizable @xmath172 has been developed at lhc .",
    "unlike the light charged hadrons where @xmath172 persist with large values up to high @xmath154 region , the @xmath2 @xmath172 quickly drops to the value from initial production with @xmath173 .    up to now , our discussion on @xmath2 @xmath1 is focused on the prompt @xmath2 .",
    "once we include the @xmath2 from bottom quark decay , new scenarios arise .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[fig10 ] shows the elliptic flow @xmath172 for inclusive @xmath2s at forward rapidity where the bottom decay is included .",
    "as one can see in the plot , the @xmath2 @xmath1 from the decay of the initially ( or pqcd ) produced bottom quarks quickly falls to close to zero at @xmath174 gev / c .",
    "however , the @xmath2s from thermalized bottom decay show significant value of @xmath172 at high @xmath111 region . at this point ,",
    "the error of the experimental data is too large to draw any conclusion of bottom quark thermalization .",
    "our calculation predicts that future precise @xmath2 @xmath172 at high @xmath154 will provide important information on bottom production in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "we have studied the cold and hot nuclear matter effects on charmonium production in relativistic heavy ion collisions . in the framework of a transport approach for the charmonium motion plus a hydrodynamic description for the medium evolution , we calculated the charmonium transverse momentum distribution and the corresponding ratios @xmath137 and @xmath3 in different rapidity and centrality bins .",
    "our model calculations agree reasonably well with the experimental data at sps , rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we found that , in comparison with the often used nuclear modification factor @xmath175 , based on the charmonium yield , the newly defined nuclear modification factor @xmath158 , based on the charmonium transverse momentum distribution , is more sensitive to the nature of the hot medium and to the degree of heavy quark thermalization . when the colliding energy increases from sps to lhc , the @xmath111 @xmath3 changes dramatically from above unity and increasing as a function of collision centrality to below unity and decreasing versus centrality .",
    "different from the yield @xmath137 which is strongly affected by both the cold and hot nuclear matter effects , the @xmath111 @xmath3 is weekly affected by the shadowing effect .",
    "in addition , we observed that the @xmath2 elliptic flow @xmath172 for minimum bias events evolves from almost zero at rhic to a large value similar to that of light hadrons at lhc .",
    "the root for these observed dramatic changes is the formation of the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma and the thermalization of charm quarks in high energy nuclear collisions at the lhc energy .",
