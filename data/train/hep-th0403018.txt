    "if string theory is truly the right unified theory , it has to make contact with the real world by reproducing the standard model at low energies .",
    "one of the signatures of the standard model is the existence of three generations of leptons and quarks , and one of the early successes of string theory was a natural mechanism producing a multiplicity of generations minus antigenerations , in the context of heterotic string compactification on a calabi - yau threefold ( 3 ) @xmath5 , using simple topological properties of the 3 @xcite .",
    "subsequent work led to many generalizations and other constructions leading to grand unified theories with @xmath6 supersymmetry at a low scale , not to mention more radical alternatives . in many ways",
    "the simplest generalization is to keep as the starting point @xmath7 , @xmath6 supergravity / super yang - mills with @xmath8 or @xmath9 gauge group and with the stringy corrections needed for anomaly cancellation , and still compactify on a 3 , only generalizing by taking a general background gauge connection for a vector bundle @xmath10 satisfying anomaly cancellation constraints @xcite .",
    "these are often referred to as `` @xmath11 '' models from the world - sheet supersymmetry of the heterotic sigma model ; in nonperturbative heterotic string theory this class of models is further generalized @xcite , but the number of generations minus antigenerations , which we will denote @xmath12 , is still determined by the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "most of the other constructions , including type iia  and iib  orientifold constructions , are dual to these two constructions in a fairly clear way .",
    "this picture raises many questions , such as : for which choices of cy @xmath5 does there exist a three generation model ?",
    "how do we find its low energy lagrangian ? which choices lead to stable vacua with low scale @xmath6 supersymmetry ?",
    "if there are many , which additional criteria if any pick out the physically relevant one ? somewhat simpler but still relevant questions are , for a given cy @xmath5 , what are possible values of @xmath12 , and are vacua with different @xmath12 connected in the configuration space of string theory ?    in this paper we discuss whether vacua with different chiral matter spectrum , including standard models with different numbers of generations , are connected in string theory .",
    "previous work on this question includes that of kachru and silverstein @xcite who discuss a mechanism which connects such vacua through a non - trivial phase transition , whose ir behavior is governed by the dimensional reduction of the phase transition associated to the @xmath13 superconformal theory in six dimensions .",
    "further work supporting this idea appears in @xcite .",
    "one motivation for the present work is to refute a ( still ) common belief that the number of generations provides an `` index '' which in classical physics is conserved under continuous variations of the background , so that such transitions could only proceed through a phase transition .    this is false and in fact there is a very simple argument that all vacua obtained by making different choices of @xmath10 must be connected already on the classical level , without going through non - classical phase transitions",
    ". we will give this in more detail below , but the essence in the heterotic string construction is just the following .",
    "we recall that the low energy gauge group is the commutant in the ten dimensional gauge group ( say ) @xmath14 of the structure group @xmath15 of the bundle @xmath10 . to get a realistic grand unified gauge group ,",
    "we take @xmath10 to have structure group @xmath16 ( for example @xmath17 leads to unbroken @xmath18 ) .",
    "the number of generations is then @xmath19 , as follows from the index theorem @xcite .",
    "now for bundles with structure group @xmath16 , @xmath20 is a topological invariant . on the other hand ,",
    "if we allow general motions in configuration space ( possibly through a potential barrier ) , nothing prevents us from deforming the connection on @xmath10 into the full ten dimensional gauge group .",
    "now , for @xmath21 and @xmath22 bundles , @xmath20 is not a topological invariant ; in fact it can not even be defined : its definition uses the third order symmetric invariant @xmath23 , which does not exist for these lie algebras . indeed , as is familiar from other discussions @xcite , all @xmath21 vector bundles on a manifold @xmath5 of ( real ) dimension less than @xmath24 with a specified rank and second chern class @xmath25 are connected by smooth deformations .",
    "such a deformation will correspond to a path in the configuration space of the full string theory , connecting vacua with two possibly different values of @xmath12 .",
    "naively , this might be thought paradoxical as chiral matter can not be lifted by varying uncharged fields or parameters in a low energy effective lagrangian .",
    "the obvious loophole which this suggests is that chiral matter must be lifted by giving vevs to charged fields , as is familiar even in the standard model . when the gauge connection in @xmath10 deforms into @xmath21 ( or any larger group containing the original @xmath16 ) , some or all of the low energy gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "if the chiral matter is nonchiral under the remaining unbroken gauge symmetry , there is no barrier to giving it a mass . as an example , after a deformation breaking @xmath18 to @xmath26 , a chiral spinor in the @xmath27 of @xmath18 becomes a nonchiral spinor of @xmath26 , which can be lifted .",
    "the remaining question is how the chiral matter can remain massive when the original gauge symmetry is restored with different @xmath28 .",
    "the answer to this question is that the final result is a new model in which the original gauge symmetry is _ not _ restored .",
    "rather , an isomorphic but different copy of the gauge group becomes unbroken .",
    "one should think of the low energy gauge group as a small unbroken subgroup of a large ( even infinite dimensional ) gauge group , the group of all gauge transformations of @xmath21 gauge theory in six dimensions , almost all of which is broken by the background .",
    "even if the unbroken gauge groups @xmath15 are isomorphic on the two sides of the transition , they can be _ two different embeddings _ of this gauge group in the large gauge group .",
    "the minimal effective field theory realization of this phenomenon is in terms of @xmath29 gauge theory , with matter chosen to always break at least one copy of @xmath15 , and along the interpolating path break to a subgroup of @xmath15",
    ". we will exhibit such effective lagrangians in section 2 .",
    "these simple arguments more or less suffice for a basic physical understanding of the phenomenon .",
    "most of the paper is devoted to seeing how this works in string theory examples , using fairly elementary methods , and dispelling various paradoxes which arise .",
    "we also consider some more detailed questions .",
    "one of these is to ask what is the potential barrier to such a transition , a question which might enter in early cosmology or in using some hypothetical `` vacuum selection principle . '' at present there is no good proposal for such a principle , and at present we do not have good control over nonperturbative corrections to the potential , but the question is still interesting to consider .    one expects the mechanism of @xcite to involve no potential barrier , because it goes through a superconformal theory , with no preferred energy scale . as for the classical mechanism we discuss , on general grounds , one might expect variations of the gauge connection on a compact manifold of `` size '' @xmath30 to go through a potential barrier of height @xmath31 . this can be made small at large radius or strong coupling but would be non - zero .",
    "is it possible that examples exist with no potential barrier ? to get at this question , we discuss explicit string theory examples .",
    "we start in section 2 with toy models , gauge theory compactified on @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are easy to work out in full detail .",
    "the infinite dimensional gauge groups which arise here are the loop groups @xmath34 .",
    "one already finds on @xmath33 and @xmath35 that chirality change in a sense is possible .",
    "we then consider a more physical example , gauge theory compactified on @xmath35 .",
    "if one considers saddle points of the potential as vacua ( nonsupersymmetric and with tachyons ) , one can find paths between such vacua which are chirality changing .",
    "this theory sits in string theory compactified to eight dimensions , so already one can have chirality change in this extremely simple example .",
    "it can be made completely transparent by realizing the gauge theory on dirichlet branes and doing a t - duality : one has a simple picture of brane recombination which changes the intersection number .    in section 4",
    "we discuss aspects of the same problem on the quintic cy .",
    "we exhibit many vector bundles with different values of @xmath20 , which shows that such processes are possible here as well , and discuss the general problem of finding out which values of @xmath12 can arise .",
    "we check , using arguments given in the appendix , that there indeed exists a stable vector bundle with @xmath20 different from that that of the tangent bundle , which can be used in heterotic compactification .",
    "finally , we give an argument ( also in the appendix ) that the two term monad construction leads to a finite number of vector bundles satisfying the anomaly cancellation condition on a large class of calabi - yau manifolds .    in section 5",
    "we discuss a similar brane construction in using d6-branes in orientifolded type iia  theory , appearing in work of cvetic , shiu and uranga @xcite which in fact realizes such a classical chirality changing transition .",
    "we will go a bit further and prove that in a very similar construction , this transition in fact proceeds through supersymmetric configurations , and thus there is no potential barrier .",
    "we suspect this is fairly general and is true of the construction of @xcite as well .",
    "section 6 contains the conclusions and further directions for study .",
    "we start off by writing down effective lagrangians which illustrate the basic point . in four space - time dimensions , since the two chiralities of spinor are complex conjugate ( or , equivalently , since one can write majorana mass terms ) , chiral spinors only exist in gauge theory .",
    "the discussion is simplest if all spinors are taken to be weyl of one chirality ; then a theory is chiral if the spinors live in a complex representation of the gauge group .",
    "the same discussion applies to eight space - time dimensions .",
    "we will write @xmath6 supersymmetric effective lagrangians , being more relevant to the later discussion",
    ". one could expand in components and drop fields to get simpler non - supersymmetric examples .",
    "one can already have complex representations and chiral spinors in @xmath36 gauge theories , so these provide the simplest examples .",
    "a simple anomaly free chiral spectrum for @xmath36 gauge theory is to take one field @xmath37 with charge @xmath38 , and @xmath39 fields @xmath40 of charge @xmath41 .",
    "can we write a single lagrangian which allows interpolating between two such spectra with different @xmath38 ?    a simple example is the following .",
    "consider @xmath42 gauge theory with chiral multiplets @xmath43 of charge @xmath13 , @xmath44 of charge @xmath45 , @xmath46 of charge @xmath47 and @xmath48 of charge @xmath49 .",
    "we furthermore couple a copy of the chiral spectrum of our last paragraph with two different values of @xmath38 to the two different @xmath36 s .",
    "finally , we write a superpotential which forces the constraint @xmath50 for some scale @xmath51 , e.g. by introducing a lagrange multiplier or squaring the constraint .",
    "this theory has a moduli space of supersymmetric vacua , and in particular a vacuum in which @xmath52 , the first @xmath36 is unbroken and the first chiral spectrum is realized , and another vacuum in which @xmath53 , the second @xmath36 is unbroken and the second chiral spectrum is realized .",
    "this already varies the chiral spectrum but does not yet give mass to the chiral multiplets of the `` wrong '' gauge group .",
    "this can be accomplished by additional superpotential terms ; for example in the @xmath54 theory we can write @xmath55 which allows lifting almost all of the original chiral matter .",
    "more complicated superpotentials can tie @xmath56 to @xmath57 above and accomplish the same thing for @xmath58 .",
    "the broken @xmath36 is broken at the scale @xmath51 , so if this is large , a low energy observer will not see the broken @xmath36 . in examples arising from kaluza - klein compactification ,",
    "this scale will be @xmath59 , the inverse size of the internal space .",
    "the same mechanism could be used for nonabelian gauge groups as well , by postulating nonchiral matter analogous to @xmath57 sufficient to completely break either gauge group .",
    "a more economical mechanism would only require breaking to a subgroup under which the chiral matter becomes nonchiral .",
    "let us consider @xmath18 grand unified theory containing @xmath60 spinors @xmath61 in the @xmath27 .",
    "using the coupling @xmath62 , we can write a coupling to a vector @xmath63 as @xmath64 which can lift all the chiral matter at the cost of breaking to @xmath26 . again",
    ", this can be tied to other matter in a way which restores a different @xmath18 elsewhere .",
    "we refrain from going into more detail at this point as there are very few constraints on this problem from effective field theory .",
    "the only constraint on possible transitions in general @xmath6 supersymmetric or non - supersymmetric theories is the rather trivial one that if the total number of weyl fermions starts off even ( resp .",
    "odd ) , it must remain even ( resp .",
    "odd ) , as fermions can only be lifted in pairs .",
    "if one requires that some part of the gauge group remains unbroken or that some chiral multiplets remain massless along the transition , this could lead to further constraints , but no specific motivation for such conditions comes to mind .      let us proceed instead by considering specific constructions which arise from higher dimensional field theory or string theory .",
    "the simplest example is the compactification of @xmath65 gauge theory with @xmath66 vector bundle on @xmath67 . although much discussed in the literature and surely familiar to most readers",
    ", it is a good warm - up as it already illustrates in what sense the usual concepts of low energy gauge theory suffice to describe the situation , and the sense in which the true gauge group contains infinitely many copies of the low energy gauge group .",
    "let the @xmath32 have coordinate @xmath68 with periodicity @xmath69 .",
    "a solution of the yang - mills equation on @xmath32 is a flat connection , whose gauge invariant data is a choice of the holonomy @xmath70 up to conjugation . by applying a gauge transformation in the connected component of the identity one can bring @xmath71 to a constant connection @xmath72 , with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "permutation of the @xmath75 are also gauge transformations ( the weyl group )",
    ". a generic wilson line will break the gauge group to @xmath76 .",
    "there are also gauge transformation not continuously connected to the identity , which can shift any @xmath75 by an integer .",
    "thus the path @xmath77 with @xmath78 $ ] is a a closed loop in the moduli space , with unbroken @xmath79 symmetry at @xmath80 broken to @xmath36 at intermediate values .",
    "while in this example the two endpoints are physically equivalent models , there is a clear sense in which the two @xmath79 subgroups are different embeddings in a larger , infinite dimensional gauge group , in this case a loop group .",
    "let us see this by doing the kk reduction explicitly .",
    "the five dimensional gauge connection decomposes into a spacetime component and an internal space component , @xmath81 .",
    "choose the internal gauge connection to be flat and diagonal , as above .",
    "the fourier expansion of the spacetime components is @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 are hermitian , so @xmath85 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) . in term of the matrix element , this is @xmath86 .",
    "we expand the parameter @xmath87 of local gauge transformations in the same way .",
    "the four dimensional lagrangian for the vector bosons is then @xmath88)^2 \\\\              & = & \\sum_ntr[(-ina_\\mu^{(n)}+i[\\phi , a_\\mu^{(n)}])(ina_\\mu^{(-n ) }              + i[\\phi , a_\\mu^{(-n ) } ] ) ] \\\\              & = & \\sum_n \\sum_{i , j } [ ( \\theta_i-\\theta_j)-n]^2a_{ij}^{(n)}a_{ji}^{(-n)}.\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath89 terms provide mass terms for almost all of the low energy gauge bosons .",
    "note that whenever @xmath90 is an integer , the non - diagonal gauge bosons @xmath91 become massless , and part of the broken symmetry is restored .",
    "a flow from @xmath92 to @xmath93 will however complete the diagonal @xmath36 gauge symmetry ( for which the gauge bosons are always @xmath94 ) to @xmath79 using `` different '' off - diagonal gauge bosons @xmath91 and @xmath95 .    in the low energy theory ,",
    "this is just the standard higgs phenomenon , as can be seen by considering the gauge transformation : @xmath96 expanded in modes , this is @xmath97 if the @xmath75 are small , the @xmath98 transform inhomogeneously under the @xmath99 modes of the gauge symmetry , so they are the goldstone bosons for the broken gauge symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , for general @xmath75 one can unbreak `` different '' parts of the gauge group .",
    "although reduction on @xmath32 is not going to lead to chiral fermions , one can still see the sense in which massless matter at the two ends of the loop is `` different '' as well .",
    "the case of adjoint fermions is the same as above , while fundamental fermions would decompose into an infinite set of modes @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 charge @xmath103 and mass @xmath104 .",
    "again , any of these modes can appear as massless matter at a point where non - abelian gauge symmetry is restored .",
    "one can get a more geometric picture of the same result by considering a gauge theory on dirichlet branes wrapped on @xmath32 and performing t - duality , leading to dirichlet branes at points in the dual @xmath32 .",
    "the non - abelian gauge bosons arise as winding strings , and as we move a d - brane around the dual @xmath32 , `` different '' winding strings shrink to zero length .",
    "we will use this picture in other examples below .",
    "we put `` different '' in quotes as the two ends of the paths we are considering are in fact completely equivalent under large gauge transformation , a feature which will not be true in the real examples . in effective field theory",
    ", one can get a more illustrative example by adding additional terms to this effective lagrangian which spoil the large gauge symmetry , such as couplings to additional matter of the sort we postulated earlier .",
    "naively , one might think of the underlying gauge group as a simple infinite product of groups `` @xmath105 , '' while to describe a given path one might keep two of these groups ( say @xmath106 and @xmath107 to describe @xmath108 ) .",
    "this is _ not _ a correct interpretation of what we have described .",
    "rather , the gauge group is a loop group , and the diagonal gauge bosons always sit in the same cartan subalgebra .",
    "thus we have not described the physics in terms of a product of finite dimensional lie groups , but as an infinite dimensional lie group .",
    "one can certainly write a model which realizes one such path in terms of two groups @xmath109 , by postulating additional bifundamental matter which breaks down to the diagonal subgroup . however this matter is not present in the underlying kk theory as we have written it .",
    "one might try to postulate additional matter in hopes of simplifying the overall description , but it is not obvious to us that this is more natural than working with the loop group .    to some extent ,",
    "the general picture is similar for any compactification , with the `` true '' gauge group of the effective gauge theory arising from compactification of yang - mills with gauge group @xmath15 on an internal space @xmath5 being the group of maps from @xmath5 to @xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to get a global picture of this group for @xmath5 of dimension greater than 2 .",
    "one furthermore expects larger groups to appear for string scale @xmath5 .",
    "the most concrete version of this we know about appears in the work of giveon , porrati and rabinovici on @xmath110 supergravity - super yang - mills theories arising from toroidal compactification of the heterotic string @xcite .",
    "we next discuss @xmath33 and @xmath35",
    ". we will be more interested in @xmath35 , but the story for @xmath33 is simpler and illustrates the essential points . although @xmath33 is not ricci flat , one can realize gauge theory on this space in string theory , by wrapping branes on a minimal volume cycle with topology @xmath33 .",
    "these spaces can be given complex structures , to become @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively , so both cases can preserve supersymmetry , and both can be discussed in the language of algebraic geometry .",
    "we will return to this later .",
    "one can also appeal to the fairly complete mathematical analysis of atiyah and bott @xcite , which finds the general solutions to the yang - mills equations on riemann surfaces , and discusses how these sit in the total space of connections .",
    "the kk compactification of @xmath36 theory coupled with gravity on @xmath33 is discussed in @xcite .",
    "one can also do straightforward kk reduction .",
    "let us consider @xmath33 .",
    "on a two dimensional manifold , @xmath36 bundles are classified topologically by the first chern class @xmath113 , taking values in @xmath114 .",
    "physically this is a version of the dirac quantization condition . on the other hand ,",
    "there are no topological invariants of an @xmath66 bundle on a simply connected two dimensional manifold .",
    "we fix the rotationally symmetric metric on @xmath33 as @xmath115 , the corresponding volume form is @xmath116 , with @xmath117 .",
    "a simple @xmath36 connection on @xmath33 with @xmath118 and which solves the yang - mills equations can be written by postulating two patches , @xmath119 with @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "the connections in the two patches are @xmath123 this connection has @xmath124 , so @xmath125",
    ". we will refer to this line bundle ( and , making a slight abuse of language , this connection ) as @xmath126 , for reasons we discuss later .",
    "in fact , all solutions of the yang - mills equations on @xmath33 for any semisimple @xmath15 can be written as a direct sum of @xmath36 solutions @xmath127 , and thus can be specified by an unordered list of integers @xmath128  @xcite . for @xmath66 , the only constraint on these integers is @xmath129 .",
    "we will speak of such an @xmath66 connection as having `` split '' into @xmath36 connections , and the unordered list of @xmath128 as the `` splitting type . ''    as @xmath66 connections , the solutions with @xmath99 are not minima of the yang - mills action ( which becomes the four dimensional effective potential ) but are instead saddle points , with unstable ( tachyonic ) modes .",
    "this can be seen explicitly , or by appealing to the results of @xcite , who show that the number of unstable modes for such a solution is the index of the yang - mills functional at the critical point .",
    "for @xmath130 on a genus @xmath131 riemann surface , this is @xmath132 . on @xmath35 ,",
    "it is easy to see in a t - dual brane description , as we discuss below .",
    "this instability will not prevent us from using these solutions as simple toy examples of chirality change .",
    "after all , the question of whether chirality change is possible in effective field theory does not depend on whether the vacua under discussion are stable or not .",
    "when we get to the real examples on calabi - yau , we will find that this toy model does properly illustrate the basic phenomenon .",
    "rather , the question is whether these different solutions are topologically connected and lead to different spectra of chiral fermions in the low energy theory .",
    "now as @xmath76 connections , these connections are topologically distinct , and classified by the homotopy class of the transition function in @xmath133 up to weyl reflection ( here @xmath134 permutations ) . however , within the space of @xmath66 connections , any of these connections can be deformed into any other ; the transition function is classified by @xmath135 which is trivial . on the other hand ,",
    "since all solutions of yang - mills take the form we discussed , all of these deformations must pass through connections which do not solve the yang - mills equations .",
    "an example of a path in the space of @xmath79 gauge connections , corresponding to the deformation from @xmath136 to @xmath137 as @xmath138 varies from 0 to 1 , can be constructed as follows . because the two gauge connections on the two patches can be subject to arbitrary gauge transformations and their forms are not unique , we start from the intrinsic description of the vector bundle by gauge transition function defined at the intersection of the two hemispheres .",
    "its form is unique up to a constant su(2 ) transformation .",

    "let us explain in a bit more detail how this seemingly complicated expression is obtained .",
    "start from the identity transition function , a very natural deformation path @xmath146 at @xmath145 this is identity as required .",
    "but at @xmath140 this is not quite the right one : it differs from equation ( [ ontransfunc ] ) by a constant @xmath79 rotation",
    ". it can be easily fixed by multiplying @xmath147 by a coordinate independent path from identity to this constant matrix @xmath148 this produces the final form of the transition function presented above .",
    "there are several points worth commenting on .    *",
    "this smooth deformation goes through non - diagonal @xmath79 matrices , and therefore through non - diagonal connections .",
    "this is basically required by the single - value condition of the map on the equator . *",
    "this particular path goes through the trivial bundle @xmath149 , as the transition function at @xmath145 is the identity .",
    "this fits with the fact that the trivial bundles is generic in the moduli space of the @xmath150 vector bundles . on the other hand ,",
    "the moduli subspace which corresponds to nontrivial splittings has nonzero codimension and is not generic . in particular , any two different splitting types can be connected continuously through the trivial bundle phase as we did above . *",
    "it is possible to go directly from @xmath151 to @xmath152 by combining two such deformation together .",
    "specifically , we can construct the deformation path as @xmath153.\\ ] ] one can easily check that this is a smooth deformation of the su(2 ) transition functions .",
    "next we discuss the gauge connections .",
    "the gauge connections on the two patches are connected by a gauge transformation at the equator @xmath154 through transition function @xmath155 , as @xmath156 .",
    "the gauge connections on the two patches @xmath157 can be changed arbitrarily by gauge transformations .",
    "it turns out the `` symmetric '' choice in which @xmath158 does not give a smooth solution for the connections .",

    "this does not contradict the standard wisdom , as long as the initial variation of the field breaks the original @xmath36 gauge group , and a different @xmath36 is restored at the endpoint .    what is confusing ,",
    "is that it appears that both unbroken @xmath36 s at the two ends of the path have the same embedding ( [ eq : subgroup ] ) in the @xmath79 , and thus should correspond to the _ same _ @xmath36 gauge group in the effective theory .",

    "one again finds that direct sums of @xmath36 connections with non - zero field strength are ( unstable ) solutions of yang - mills with chiral fermion zero modes , whose number is given by the same formula ( [ eq : twodindex ] ) .",
    "chirality change is possible because the unbroken subgroup , associated to a covariantly constant scalar @xmath217 , is different for the different saddle points ( they can be written explicitly using theta functions ) .",
    "the @xmath35 picture can be made much more intuitive by realizing the gauge theory on branes and taking advantage of t - duality .",

    "we restrict to orthogonal torus ( so the metric is diagonal and @xmath220 is pure imaginary ) which is mapped into itself after t - duality .",
    "let us consider a simple example which embeds a @xmath36 connection with nontrivial field strength in the @xmath9 gauge group .",

    ", it is simplest to think of @xmath9 as embedded in @xmath225 , postulate the @xmath225 connection @xmath226 , and then impose a reality condition on the fields .",
    "this parallels the usual construction of type istring using the @xmath227 projection .",

    "let @xmath230 , any brane configuration on orbifold is lifted to @xmath231-invariant configuration .",
    "the gauge connection in the @xmath228 direction become the @xmath228 position of the branes in the dual picture .",
    "thus we have 16 branes described by @xmath232 and 16 brane images described by @xmath233 , or in terms of the a- and b - cycles , they wraps @xmath234 and @xmath235 respectively .",
    "there are @xmath236 intersection points between the two sets of branes , corresponding to k cpt pairs of chiral fermions in the @xmath27 and @xmath237 representation of @xmath238 .",
    "= 3.5 cm    a geometric picture of smooth change of chirality from @xmath239 to @xmath240 is shown in fig.[branea ] .",
    "the two sets of branes wrap the one cycle @xmath241+[b]$ ] and @xmath241-[b]$ ] respectively .",
    "as one deforms the branes , the chiral fermions living at the two points of intersection of the @xmath239 branes pair up and gain a mass proportional to the distance between the two sets of branes .",
    "the intermediate configurations are not minimal surfaces , and the corresponding gauge connections do not satisfy the yang - mills equation .",
    "furthermore , they will be irreducible @xmath79 connections , and the gauge group in the effective theory is broken to @xmath238 .",
    "finally when one reaches a minimal configuration again ( all the branes coincide with the o8-branes at one end of @xmath242 ) the gauge group is restored to @xmath9 .",
    "again sice the change of chirality ( in the case we just described it is actually disappearance of chiral fermions ) is accompanied with the change of gauge group , it can be understood as the higgs phenomena .    for general @xmath223",
    "the picture is essentially the same .",
    "we see that there are an infinite number of brane configurations , parameterized by @xmath243 and each carries @xmath236 chiral fermions , each connected by brane deformation .",
    "there are even more configurations , constructed by wrapping branes about the cycles @xmath244+k[b]$ ] . for @xmath245 , these are t - dual to irreducible connectionis with rank greater than one @xcite .    in this example , the infinite number of possibilities is clearly related to the fact that we are considering unstable configurations .",
    "the only consistent stable configurations are those in which all branes are parallel , which prevents the type of cancellations in the tadpole condition we are seeing here , and it is easy to see that these are finite in number .",
    "one hopes that this finiteness is true in higher dimensions as well .      to get a similar understanding in calabi - yau compactification",
    ", we will need better mathematical technology .",
    "most of our understanding in this case is for the special case of supersymmetric compactification of string theory , for which one can appeal to algebraic geometry and the theory of holomorphic bundles .    within the set of all vector bundles on a complex manifold",
    ", one can distinguish the holomorphic bundles , those for which ( in some basis ) the transition functions are holomorphic .",
    "the necessary condition for this is @xmath246 , so in one complex dimension any vector bundle can be treated this way .",
    "this is a great mathematical advantage as the problem of finding holomorphic bundles does not require solving differential equations ; it is purely algebraic .",
    "one can then go on to solve the yang - mills equations @xmath247 .",
    "to be a bit more precise , for holomorphic bundles the natural concept of gauge equivalence is more general ; one allows general gauge transformations @xmath248 ( or more generally a non - compact group obtained from the complexification of the original lie algebra ) , and the statement is that within this larger gauge orbit we can look for specific unitary connections which solve the yang - mills equations , here equivalent to @xmath249 .",
    "when one exists , it is unique up to standard ( unitary ) gauge equivalence ; the necessary and sufficient condition for it to exist is @xmath51-stability , as discussed in great detail in @xcite .",
    "a rank 1 holomorphic bundle is usually called a line bundle .",
    "the line bundles on @xmath250 are classified by the integer @xmath251 ( the degree ) , and can be written in terms of two patches and a transition function @xmath252 .",
    "the usual notation for such a line bundle is @xmath126 .",
    "one can equivalently say that @xmath253 for @xmath254 has as holomorphic sections functions of degree @xmath92 in the homogeneous coordinates on @xmath255 .",
    "the bundles with @xmath256 can be defined as the duals of these , or as bundles whose sections must have poles of total order @xmath257 .    as for @xmath258 bundles on @xmath250 ,",
    "these are classified by grothendieck s theorem : a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath10 can always be written in as a direct sums of line bundles , @xmath259 where the @xmath128 are uniquely determined ( again as an unordered list).one sometimes says that the bundle `` splits , '' and this decomposition is its `` splitting type . '' note that this is a finer classification than by topological type , and in fact is the same as our classification of solutions of the yang - mills equations , for reasons we will explain shortly .",
    "the theorem also classifies @xmath260 bundles : these are just the subset with @xmath129 .    as we said , on @xmath33 ( or any two dimensional compact manifold ) all @xmath260 bundles are continuously connected and are all equivalent to holomorphic bundles .",
    "thus it must be possible to make continuous transitions between elements of this discrete set of bundles .",
    "this seeming paradox is not hard to understand . consider a family of holomorphic bundles obtained by varying a complex parameter @xmath261 , defined by the transition functions @xcite @xmath262 for @xmath263 this is @xmath264 . on the other hand , for any @xmath265 it turns out that this is equivalent as a holomorphic bundle to @xmath266",
    "this can be seen from the decomposition @xmath267 the two matrices can be extended _ holomorphically _ to the unit disk centered around @xmath268 and @xmath269 respectively .",
    "the transition function on the equator is trivial up to gauge transformation on the two open patches , thus corresponds to trivial splitting types of the line bundles .",

    "this is indeed what happens .",
    "the general theorem states that the restriction of the rank 2 vector bundle e to any line @xmath285 , on which exactly k points of the set @xmath286 lie , splits in the form @xmath287 the generic splitting type of this bundle is @xmath288 .",
    "any rank one line bundle on @xmath250 is @xmath51-stable and thus admits connections solving the yang - mills equations , ( [ eq : spherecon ] ) .",
    "thus , all of the considerations of the previous sections using explicit gauge connections can be translated to this holomorphic context .",
    "we will see some of this in a calabi - yau example below .    to avoid confusion",
    ", one should keep in mind that despite the fact that the holomorphic bundles of different splitting type are connected by an infinitesimal variation of parameter @xmath261 , the corresponding solutions of the yang - mills equations are separated by a finite distance .",

    "in general , a family of solutions of hermitian yang - mills , only arises from a family of holomorphic bundles .",

    "we still need to check that in fact there are compactifications on the same cy with different numbers of generations which could be connected in this way .    to find such supersymmetric compactifications , we just need to find examples of semi - stable holomorphic bundles on the same cy whose chern classes differ only in @xmath28 .",
    "this is more or less already known from the study of @xmath11 models and is in any case easy to show using the techniques commonly used there , as we will do .",

    "even very basic questions of this type remain unanswered ; for example whether or not the number of calabi - yau threefolds is finite .",
    "a question of this type for which the answer is actually known is whether the @xmath16 bundles which satisfy the above requirements for heterotic string compactification , come with a finite or infinite number of distinct values of @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , there is a finite list of possible values .",
    "this follows for a theorem of maruyama @xcite , and more recent work of langer@xcite , which show that , having fixed the rank , @xmath311 and @xmath312 , there are a finite number of possible values of @xmath28 taken by semistable bundles .",
    "an intuitive explanation of the result is the following .",
    "one considers a hypersurface @xmath313 in the cy3 , and considers the restriction of @xmath10 to @xmath313 .",

    "if we ignore the spectator branes in these two configurations , the change can be described in terms of brane types as @xmath364 the f and g branes have double number than those listed in the table , because their @xmath358 image branes are themselves , which are also included in the equation .",
    "one would like to know how configurations i and iii are connected .",
    "we propose that they can be connected through configuration ii .",
    "the gauge groups and chiral spectrum of ii are as follows , @xmath365 one realization of the chirality change ( [ eq : onetothree ] ) proceeds in two steps as follows .",

    "chemical reaction , \" the chiral spectrum is changed .",
    "having narrowed down the deformation to a more specific process , one wonders whether this can be realized in a supersymmetric way . at first , the supersymmetric condition ( [ eq : susyangle ] ) on the angles of the brane seems very constrained .",
    "for example , in ( [ eq : twotothree ] ) , @xmath369 is fixed , which leaves only one deformation parameter , say @xmath370 , from solving the constraint . on the first @xmath35 , because of the periodicity of the torus , @xmath370 can only take discrete values , @xmath371 .",
    "this might suggest that the supersymmetric solutions are isolated  islands \" in the configuration space , and no supersymmetric deformation can connect them .",
    "however it is simple to see that at least some supersymmetric deformations are possible .",
    "the mclean theorem@xcite states that for a compact special lagrangian submanifold @xmath60 in a calabi - yau manifold , the moduli space of special lagrangian deformation of @xmath60 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath372 , where @xmath372 is the first betti number of @xmath60 . a heuristic argument for this uses supersymmetry and world - volume gauge theory . assume a d - brane wraps @xmath60 , which has a @xmath36 bundle on it .",
    "the flat wilson lines then parameterize the moduli space of dimension @xmath372 . paired with another moduli from minimal area of the string worldsheet in the calabi - yau with boundary on the slag wrapping the 1-cycle , they form a complex parameter .    now the orbifold @xmath373 is simply connected .",
    "this is clearly the case as all the one - cycles in the original @xmath374 are odd under a certain orbifold group element , and so all disappear after the orbifold projection .",
    "however all the special lagrangian 3-cycle @xmath46 discussed so far has the topology of the tori of real dimension three , and invariant under the whole orbifold group .",
    "this means that in the orbifold such a slag has moduli space of complex dimension three .",
    "a single wrapped d - brane must also have moduli space of complex dimension three .",
    "if multiple branes wrap the same slag submanifold , the moduli space will increase correspondingly , as the wilson lines can take value in @xmath375 gauge group now .",
    "the consideration of multiple wrapped branes brings us to another important point . in the case at hand ,",
    "one encounters not merely a single brane wrapping a slag , as one notices that there are large number of branes wrapping the same slag cycle in the solutions to the constraint equation given above .",
    "in addition , a brane s @xmath358 image is always present because of the orientifold action .",
    "thus the object to deform , is not certain singly wrapped slag submanifold , but the combined 3-cycle with different components wrapped by multiple branes .",
    "in particular , splitting and recombining are possible in this setup .",
    "let us now describe the supersymmetric deformation from i to ii ( [ eq : onetotwo ] ) .",
    "first observe that the branes involved ( b , d and g in our notation ) all wrap the same @xmath376-cycle in the third torus , i.e. @xmath369 , and thus remains the same though the deformation .",
    "so the deformation actually happens in four - dimensional complex space @xmath377 , and original special lagrangian 3-cycles reduce to slag 2-cycles .",
    "the advantage is that algebraic geometry technique can be applied , since slag in 4d space is just complex curve with respect to a different complex structure , as shown in @xcite , where the coordinate system is @xmath378 now it is easy to identify b , b , d and g type branes with complex curves in the new coordinate system , as @xmath379 the orientifold action @xmath358 acts as @xmath380 in the new coordinate system .",
    "= 3.5 cm    having realized the non - trivial part of the brane configuration as complex curves , the deformation is straightforward .",
    "the local picture is illustrated by figure [ braneb]@xcite .",
    "this picture of brane recombination , while preserving supersymmetry at every stage , is analyzed in detail in @xcite for the noncompact target space , which can be viewed as the local model for the process we describe here .    to get a global description , we realize the complex curve as complex intersection of the 4-tori @xmath368 with a hypersurface in the product of the projective space @xmath381 , deforming the hypersurface will results in a family of holomorphic curves that connects the two configurations .",
    "each @xmath35 is nonsingular , can be embedded as cubic curve in @xmath271 , which in terms of the homogeneous coordinates @xmath382 on @xmath271 is described by @xmath383 these equations define separately a bidegree @xmath384 and a @xmath385 divisor in @xmath381 , which are topologically @xmath386 and @xmath387 .",
    "their intersection will produce @xmath388 .",
    "notice that the two tori has the same complex structure , so @xmath389 and @xmath390 are the same for the two factors .",
    "the supersymmetric @xmath391 branes are complex curves in @xmath368 .",
    "we now find appropriate divisors in @xmath381 , so that their intersection with the two divisors [ eq : toriembed ] defining the two embedded tori will give these curves .",
    "for this purpose , we need the map from the tori to the homogeneous coordinates , which is through weierstrass @xmath392-function , @xmath393 , \\\\",

    "are mapped to @xmath398 and @xmath399 respectively from weierstrass function mapping in the coordinate patch @xmath400 .",
    "thus they can be identified with equation @xmath401 and @xmath402 respectively .",
    "there are complications from the degree counting in determining the actual number of wrapped d - branes .",
    "an elliptic curve has degree-3 in @xmath271 , which intersects degree-1 divisor @xmath402 at three points .",
    "further intersecting with the torus in the second @xmath271 , it produces 3 copies of the second torus , which is equivalent to three copies of g - type branes .",
    "similarly , @xmath401 corresponds to three copies of d - type branes .",
    "this is the common feature of embedding tori by weierstrass form : its intersection with any divisor will be multiple of three .",
    "we have arranged our brane solution meet this requirement . excluding the common factor of 4 for the possible orbifold images , the brane combination @xmath403 is described by intersection of the tori with the divisor @xmath404 the @xmath405 branes equations are @xmath406 . now under mapping by weierstrass function",
    ", it leads to @xmath407 and @xmath408 in @xmath381 .",
    "account for the degree , @xmath409 in the coordinate patch @xmath410 is @xmath411 .",
    "in homogeneous coordinates , this leads to equation @xmath412 because @xmath358 acts as @xmath413 , so above equation is invariant under @xmath358 , as it should .    both ( [ eq : divone ] ) and ( [ eq : divtwo ] ) are degree @xmath414 divisors on @xmath381 .",
    "orientifold action @xmath358 acts on the second torus only , @xmath415 , which can be lifted to @xmath271 as @xmath416 .",
    "so if the defining polynomial is even function of @xmath417 , it is automatically @xmath358 invariant .",
    "thus the family of hypersurface which both ( [ eq : divone ] ) and ( [ eq : divtwo ] ) belong to can be written as @xmath418 deformation within this family can make a transition from configuration i to ii .    the intersection of ( [ eq : divone ] ) and ( [ eq : divtwo ] ) with @xmath388 each has the topology of two torus intersecting at one point however the generic member of the family of the @xmath414 divisor intersecting with @xmath388 has quite different topology . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "this is specified by a configuration matrix @xmath419 where the first column specifies the dimensions of the product projective spaces , and the other columns specify the degrees of the divisors corresponding to each projective space .",
    "the configuration represents a family of complete intersections ( can be smooth or singular ) defined by three polynomial constraints specified by the configuration matrix .",
    "it is parameterized by the space of coefficients of the polynomials .",
    "a generic member of this family is a smooth complex curve .",
    "let us calculate the genus of this curve @xmath46 .",
    "let the khler forms of the two @xmath271 be @xmath420 and @xmath421 .",
    "the tangent bundle of @xmath46 is a sub - bundle of @xmath422 , @xmath423 , whose quotient is the vector bundle @xmath270 determined by the polynomials . in other words",
    ", there is an exact sequence @xmath424 this implies the relation of the total chern class @xmath425 the euler character is obtained from the coefficient of the volume form @xmath426 of @xmath381 , in the product @xmath427 which gives @xmath428 . by the familiar riemann - hurwitz formula for curves @xmath429 , this leads to genus of @xmath46 being 37 .",
    "now it is clear that the two configurations that we tried to connect holomorphically are really two degenerate limits of the same family of curves with genus @xmath430 .",
    "these degenerate configurations develop intersecting points which are singular . but these singular limits have a perfect classical interpretation in the gauge theory , that is the brane splits into multiple branes wrapping different supersymmetric cycles , together with intersections where chiral multiplets live .    as a last step of the proof of the supersymmetric transition realizing chirality change , one notice that the transition from ii to iii ( [ eq : twotothree ] )",
    "can be similarly proved .",
    "switching the role of the second torus with the third torus , it becomes the same process as the transition from i to ii .",
    "thus , we have an explicit example , in which by recombination and splitting , chirality change with isomorphic gauge groups takes place entirely in the moduli space of supersymmetric string vacua .",
    "we showed that string theory compactifications leading to low energy effective field theories with different chiral matter content are connected even at the classical level , in a way which can be understood from several viewpoints : effective field theory , higher dimensional gauge theory and brane constructions .",
    "the loophole in the naive argument that this is not possible is that the true effective field theory description of the situation is in terms of an infinite gauge group , which in the gauge theory examples is the group of all maps from the internal space to the ( finite dimensional ) gauge group , which contains many copies of any given low energy gauge group .",
    "chirality change takes place by breaking one copy of the low energy gauge group , and restoring a different copy with different chiral matter .",
    "we even found an example in which the transition takes place entirely on the supersymmetric moduli space , in iia  theory with d6-branes .",
    "again , there is no particular paradox in this . in a partially understood sense , this is mirror to similar transitions between type i  vacua ( via t - duality / mirror symmetry ) and the heterotic string ( via s - duality ) . on the other hand , detailed understanding of",
    "the mirror map usually involves @xmath431 corrections , leaving open the possibility that these corrections are required to get transitions purely through supersymmetric classical vacua .",
    "it would be nice to find an example of a transition purely in ten dimensional yang - mills theory ( we suspect it is possible ) .",
    "the larger question which this investigation set out to address is to what extent we can think of `` all '' or large sets of string theory compactifications as described by a single effective field theory , the `` effective field theory of everything , '' with all quantum effects already summarized in the effective lagrangian .",
    "such an effective field theory would have to contain an infinite number of fields , almost all of which are massive in any small region of configuration space , and would probably not be the best way to study any one compactification .",
    "nevertheless it might be very useful as a unifying and organizing concept behind the general discussion .",
    "one can try to propose specific formal realizations of this idea such as the explicit kaluza - klein expansion of higher dimensional gauge theory keeping all modes which can become massless anywhere in the region of configuration space of interest , a similar discussion based on world sheet considerations along the lines proposed for toroidal compactification of the heterotic string by giveon , porrati and rabinovici @xcite , a similar proposal based on string field theory , or otherwise .",
    "however , the main question which will determine whether there is an effective field theory of everything or not , is not a formal question .",
    "rather , it is the physical question of what type of phase transitions connect the different vacua of string / m theory .",
    "certain phase transitions can be easily described in effective field theory language , such as the coulomb - higgs transition .",
    "others can be so described by taking advantage of duality , such as the coulomb - confinement transition .",
    "while going beyond the traditional idea of effective field theory , a collection of effective field theories related by explicit dualities , with different theories appropriate in different regions of configuration space , would be a pretty concrete description of the situation .    while such a picture is often cited as the basic picture behind string / m theory duality , it is not yet clear whether one can use it in this literal form , as there is no guarantee that all of the phase transitions one needs to connect the different vacua are of this form .",
    "for example , there is no clear argument in supergravity that first order transitions are impossible ( indeed one can not take for granted standard considerations of minimizing the energy ) .",
    "another example is a phase transition associated with a non - trivial fixed point theory . while one should certainly not try to describe the physics of the phase transition itself by effective field theory , one might hope that there exists an effective field theory which describes all massive deformations of the fixed point theory and the configuration space in its vicinity .",
    "this is problematic in the case of a non - trivial fixed point theory which arises at the meeting point of several branches of moduli space , which individually are described by very different sets of degrees of freedom .",
    "the simplest effective field theory description would have to contain all of these degrees of freedom , and on each branch give mass to all fields associated with other branches .",
    "this is impossible if some of these theories are chiral .",
    "one might gain more possibilities by postulating dualities between some of these fields and others , but in any case there are many examples for which such a description is not known at present , and might be impossible .",
    "our present discussion suggests that , even in cases where this is impossible , it might still be possible to describe all of the branches within a single effective field theory , which connects them up along a different line of deformations",
    ". it would not be manifest that they are also connected through non - trivial phase transitions , but this information might be taken into account separately .",
    "one approach to show that this is impossible , would be to find an order parameter which could not change in effective field theory . in the case at hand",
    ", we showed that the number of generations is not the relevant order parameter . on the other hand",
    ", there is a candidate order parameter in the heterotic string construction .",
    "it is @xmath25 or equivalently the number of heterotic fivebranes .",
    "thus , to judge the connectedness of this moduli space in effective field theory , we must ask , is @xmath25 preserved under all processes which do not pass through non - trivial fixed point theories ? while true in the heterotic string , it is not at all obvious in the full string / m theory , again because there are dual descriptions , such as @xmath432 compactification , in which it is not obvious how to define this number .    as a final comment ,",
    "all of the connections we have been talking about between solutions of string theory are visible at low energy .",
    "a possibly more important question is whether there are simpler ways to connect solutions in a regime of large quantum and thermal fluctuations , such as one expects to describe early cosmology .",
    "though there is interesting work on the related question of time dependent interpolating solutions ( e.g. describing brane - antibrane annihilation ) , it seems to us that at present nothing is known about this last topic .",
    "perhaps the concrete pictures we have explored in this work could inspire some good questions here .",

    "the complex moduli space is parameterized by the map from @xmath436 to @xmath437 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath438 where @xmath439 and @xmath439 are homogeneous degree 3 polynomials in homogeneous coordinates @xmath440 of @xmath441 , and @xmath442 are homogeneous degree 2 polynomials .",
    "we first discuss the question whether generically v is a vector bundle .",
    "this is important for interpretation of this vector bundle as a perturbative heterotic string vacuum .",
    "the reason is that singular fibers corresponds to low dimensional branes as small instanton limit of the vector bundle , which signals the existence of the non - perturbative degrees of freedom .    to be rid of singular fibers ,",
    "the rank of the fibers of v must be constant over all of the calabi - yau space . because v is defined as the kernel of the map @xmath443",
    ", this is equivalent to the image of @xmath443 should have constant rank 2 at each point of calabi - yau .",
    "actually for @xmath433 on quintic , we have a stronger result , namely that v is generically a vector bundle on the whole @xmath441 , not merely on the quintic hypersurface .",
    "the proof goes as follows .",
    "assume at point @xmath444 , @xmath445 .",
    "this means that the six two - dimensional vectors @xmath446 are proportional to each other .",
    "this is true if and only if the five functions @xmath447 are all equal to zero at @xmath448 .",
    "so the position of singular fibers are the solutions to the 5 equations @xmath449 .",
    "generically , there is no solution to these equations as five divisors have no intersection on @xmath441 generically .",
    "thus we can always find the map @xmath443 such that v is a vector bundle .",
    "next we discuss the stability property of @xmath433 .",
    "we would like to know whether there exists a stable vector bundle in the same complex deformation class of v. this is again by analysis of f. we can only obtain partial results , namely , we can prove that if choosing appropriately , v is stable for a class of subsheaves which also has monad like description . in general the stability property of a vector bundle is a very hard problem practically , especially for high rank vector bundles at high dimensional space .",
    "in view of this difficulty , although we only can prove the stability partially , we feel that it is a strong evidence that v can be a n=1 perturbative heterotic string vacuum .",
    "a vector bundle is stable if all its subsheaves @xmath450 with strictly smaller rank satisfies the condition @xmath451 . here",
    "@xmath452 is called the slope of the vector bundle , and the stability criterion we use here is called slope stability condition .",
    "this is the appropriate stability condition at the large volume limit of the calabi - yau space , otherwise we should use the @xmath453-stability suitable for stringy calabi - yau .",
    "any vector bundle @xmath450 has injective resolution , which is a complex @xmath454 whose cohomology is trivial except at the first term .",
    "the vector bundles @xmath455 are injective objects in the derived category of torsionless sheaves . in case of @xmath441 ,",
    "these injective objects are simply direct sum of line bundles of various degrees , @xmath456 .",
    "for @xmath450 to be subsheaf of v means the following diagram commutes , @xmath457 on @xmath441 , a generic sheaf has an injective resolution with five terms , by analogous construction of koszul resolution .",
    "because of difficulty to list all of these sheaves , we will merely check those subsheaves of v such that they can be similar described as a kernel of a surjective map between two direct sum of line bundles .",
    "this is the same as saying v has the same description as v.    the injective resolution of a sheaf is not unique .",
    "we assume a minimal resolution of v. this means that we choose @xmath455 s to have minimal rank among all the equivalent injective resolutions of v. this condition , combined with the injection of map @xmath458 , yields the injection @xmath459 . but @xmath460 may has a nontrivial kernel , and yet the diagram still commutes .",
    "this causes possible complications .",
    "the potentially destabilizing subsheaf @xmath450 satisfies the following constraints :    1 .",
    "@xmath461 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath462 is injective ; 3 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath463 should all have nonnegative degrees .",

    "again , this is an over - determined set of equations , and generically there is no solutions .",
    "3 .   @xmath485 .",
    "this is the same as saying v contains @xmath467 as a sub - bundle .",
    "obviously , a generically f will involve both @xmath467 factors , and there should not be such nontrivial sub - line bundle n v. direct proof via dimension counting is very similar to case one , and we will omit the details .",
    "since we require that the resolution of @xmath450 is minimal , so if there is a factor @xmath467 in @xmath464 was involved trivially , there must be a resolution with smaller resolution without this factor .",
    "so we can just consider that @xmath464 only contains @xmath337 factors .",

    "there are no solutions generically .",
    "2 .   @xmath488 . by a trivial linear transformation of the two line bundles ,",
    "this decomposes into direct sum of two series .",
    "no solutions generically .",
    "3 .   @xmath489 .",
    "the only nontrivial case is @xmath490 .",
    "similar to case i.2 .",
    "there are 135 unknowns , but there are 270 equations .",
    "generically , there is no solution .",
    "4 .   @xmath491 .",
    "the nontrivial cases are @xmath490 or @xmath492.similar to case i.2 . there are 170 and 110 unknowns respectively , , and 340 equations for both case . again there is no solutions generically .",
    "all the other possibilities will involve the cases considered above .",
    "we can thus draw the conclusion that vector bundle @xmath433 is stable against a class of subsheaves that has can be similarly described as @xmath10 itself .",
    "in this section , following @xcite , we prove there are only finite number of solutions to the sets of holomorphic vector bundles which are described by monad construction and satisfy anomaly cancellation condition on a calabi - yau manifold described by intersecting hyperplanes in weighted projective space .    the rank - n vector bundle v is parameterized by two sets of positive integers @xmath493 constrained by @xmath348 where constant b is defined in ( [ qvalue ] ) and fixed by the second chern class of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "we define @xmath494 for convenience .",
    "\\(1 ) n is a finite positive integer .",
