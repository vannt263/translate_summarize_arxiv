    "the envelope moves away from the star .",
    "meanwhile , the central star heats up and ionizes the circumstellar gas .",
    "the remains of the envelope eventually disperse into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , while the central star cools off as a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "agb star evolution is intimately linked to its dust production .",
    "the circumstellar dust drives mass loss and shapes the circumstellar environments . while agb stars generally have spherically symmetric mass loss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most post - agb stars and pne show axisymmetric circumstellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "the axisymmetry is seen as a bipolar or hourglass - shaped reflection nebula , where the two lobes ( bubbles , jets ) of the nebula are separated by an equatorial waist , or torus .",
    "the onset of the axisymmetry is believed to occur very near the end of the agb phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while some pne are indeed spherical @xcite , these appear to be old nebulae , and it is increasingly evident that the majority of pne are aspherical , and that most are bipolar @xcite .",
    "a suggested mechanism for shaping pne is the generalized interacting stellar winds ( gisw ) model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model",
    "a circumstellar torus is present in the equatorial plane of the agb star .",
    "the exact origin of the torus is not specified , but is agreed to be somehow created by the slowly expanding agb wind .",
    "later , during the post - agb and pne phase , a faster wind interacts with this torus .",
    "the fast wind is blocked by the torus in the equatorial plane of the agb star , but may easily flow into the polar regions , creating a bipolar ( p)pn .",
    "the development of axisymmetry , and in particular the origin of the equatorial torus needed to create it in the gisw model , has been attributed to various mechanisms . here , the presence of a companion star , fast rotating agb stars , magnetic fields , and the compression of gas into the equatorial region by two jets have been considered in various ways .",
    "we will briefly discuss these mechanisms below .",
    "a companion star may have several effects .",
    "first , it may cause the agb star to spin - up ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this spin - up may lead to small deviations from spherical symmetry of the agb star itself , which are subsequently amplified in the dust condensation region due to the non - linear behavior and the strong temperature and density dependence of the dust formation process .",
    "this then leads to preferential mass loss along the equator .",
    "second , to spin - up an agb star , the companion must be close ( see sect.[sect : validityofassumptions ] for a quantification of the necessary proximity ) .",
    "if the companion is close however , and the agb star s mass loss rate is high enough , the companion may accrete mass and create jets in the process .",
    "this also leads to axisymmetry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . finally , the gravitational influence of a companion star may help shape the agb star s envelope into an axisymmetric geometry @xcite .",
    "several agb stars and pne show magnetic fields in their circumstellar environments , and these fields are often suggested to be the main agent responsible for creating axisymmetry .",
    "however , @xcite argues that a single star can not supply the energy and angular momentum to create the large coherent magnetic fields required for shaping the circumstellar wind , although magnetic fields may have a secondary role .",
    "equatorially enhanced densities are commonly attributed to the equatorially - enhanced mass loss of an agb star .",
    "however , they may also originate from the compression of gas into the equatorial region by bipolar jets .",
    "@xcite argue that the interaction of a slow agb wind with a collimated fast wind ( cfw ) blown by a main - sequence or white dwarf companion leads to equatorial density enhancements . here , the cfw originates from the accretion of the agb wind into a disk around the companion .",
    "the cfw forms two jets ( lobes ) along the symmetry axis which compress the slow agb wind near the equatorial plane , leading to the formation of a dense slowly expanding ring . later , after the cfw and slow agb wind cease , the primary star leaves the agb and blows a second , more spherical , fast wind .",
    "this wind is then collimated by the dense equatorial material and leads to a bipolar pn as described by the gisw model .",
    "while these various mechanisms for axisymmetric circumstellar structures may explain the shapes of pne , they do not address the time evolution of the shape of the circumstellar shell .",
    "in particular , they generally fail to address the fact that most agb shells are spherical ( and remain that way for most of the agb phase ) , whereas most post - agb objects ( and pne ) are bipolar ( or multi - polar ) .    in this paper",
    "we address the temporal changes in the axisymmetry of the circumstellar envelope , and in particular the development of the torus that is required in the gisw model . for this purpose",
    "we consider the scenario of an agb star that rotates at a sufficient angular speed at the start of the agb phase .",
    "next , as the star evolves , we assume that the rotational angular momentum of the agb star is somehow conserved . although simplistic , we will demonstrate that if the above conditions are met , some very important observational features of agb star axisymmtery evolution may be reproduced . in sect.[sect : modeldescription ] we discuss our model and the validity of its underlying assumptions . in sect.[sect :",
    "resultsofthemodel ] we discuss the results of the model .",
    "sect.[sect : conclusions ] lists our conclusions .",
    "we note that in order for what follows to succeed , the agb star needs to have a sufficiently large angular velocity at the start of the agb phase .",
    "this probably necessitates some sort of a spin - up , which will be discussed in sect.[sect : axisymmetryandstellarevolution ] .",
    "the mass - loss rate is affected by the escape velocity .",
    "a rotating sphere will tend to become oblate and will have a reduced gravitational acceleration , @xmath5 , at the equator compared to the pole . with a lower @xmath5 , the escape velocity is reduced and thus mass loss increases .",
    "therefore we need to consider the effect this will have on the structure / shape of the circumstellar shell and how this effect changes with time .",
    "we start by considering @xmath6 , which measures the ratio in effective gravity between the equator and poles of a rotating agb star . for a test - mass @xmath7 at the surface of the star",
    ", it is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath1 and @xmath10 are the mass and radius of the star .",
    "@xmath11 represents the angular velocity of the star at the equator .",
    "we next assume that the angular momentum of the agb star is conserved , i.e. @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the moment of inertia of the star . here",
    ", we adopt the notation that @xmath14 indicates the initial value of a given quantity @xmath15 , i.e. the value of @xmath15 right after the spin - up . assuming solid - body rotation through the stellar envelope , and that at all times the star s deviation from spherical symmetry is small , and ignoring the core s moment of inertia and increasing mass during agb evolution , we have @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the envelope s mass . from this",
    "it then follows that @xmath18 using eq.[eq : omegasquared ] and @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the luminosity and effective temperature of the star , we then find for @xmath6 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the core mass of the star .    using eq.[eq : rgrav2 ] , we may follow @xmath6 as a function of stellar evolution .",
    "since the agb star s deviations from spherical symmetry are amplified in the dust condensation region , the behavior of the degree of axisymmetry in the envelope may in principle be followed as a function of stellar evolution as well .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the mass density distribution in the equatorial and polar direction respectively , is a measure for the degree of axisymmetry in the envelope . if the exact relation between @xmath24 and @xmath6 is known , and if we assume that @xmath24 in first order only depends on @xmath6 ( see below ) , we may monitor @xmath24 with stellar evolution .",
    "while the relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath6 is non - trivial , we can still make an estimate for such a relation . modeled the structure of a stationary dust driven wind for a @xmath27 agb star ( @xmath28k , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) spun - up by a companion star to various angular velocities , up to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for the @xmath33 ( @xmath30 ) star . here , the spin - up leads to small deviations from spherical symmetry of the agb star itself , which are subsequently amplified in the dust condensation region due to the non - linear behavior and the strong temperature and density dependence of the dust formation process .",
    "the result is an axisymmetric envelope .",
    "the models of provide rotationally - modulated solutions for the structure of stationary dust - driven winds , both as a function of rotation rate and polar angle .",
    "the output of their models includes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the mass - loss rate ratio and terminal outflow - velocity ratio between the equatorial and polar direction",
    ".    using eq.[eq : rgrav ] and @xmath36 we calculated @xmath6 and @xmath24 for these models , in order to estimate a relation between them .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : figure1 ] .",
    "as expected , it can be seen that with decreasing @xmath6 , i.e. stronger deviations from spherical symmetry of the agb star , @xmath24 increases , i.e. the envelope becomes more axisymmetric . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will assume that this relation is valid for all agb stars .",
    "the validity of this assumption will be discussed below .",
    "( top ) , @xmath35 ( middle ) , and @xmath24 ( bottom ) as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the curves were calculated from detailed model results by .",
    "the calculations were done for a @xmath27 , @xmath28k , agb star for two different luminosities ( for a @xmath33 star , rotating up to @xmath31 , and a @xmath30 star , rotating up to @xmath32 ) .",
    "for details see the main text . ]",
    "we now briefly discuss the validity of the assumption of conservation of angular momentum of the star , and the assumption of the use of the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath24 found in fig.[fig : figure1 ] for all agb stars .",
    "the most important assumption in our model is that after the spin - up , the rotational angular momentum of the agb star is conserved .",
    "the validity of this assumption is uncertain , since there are various possible sinks and sources of angular momentum for the star .",
    "angular momentum will be lost from the star through its stellar wind ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this loss can be substantial , and may in principle remove all of the stars angular momentum . ignoring the magnetic influence beyond the stellar surface and the moment of inertia of the core relative to that of the envelop , and assuming solid body rotation through the envelope , @xcite showed that the amount of angular momentum in the envelope is proportional to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "for the upper agb @xmath39 . using the initial - final mass relation , which links the main sequence mass of a low or intermediate mass star with its final mass after the agb phase ( i.e. its wd mass ) , and assuming that the agb phase terminates",
    "when the stellar envelope s mass has been reduced to about @xmath40 , it can be shown that the envelope mass of a @xmath27 ( @xmath41 ) changes by a factor @xmath42 , i.e. the angular momentum of the star decreases by a factor @xmath43 ! the loss of angular momentum through the stellar wind is therefore important .",
    "other means by which the envelope may lose angular momentum include magnetic breaking and expansion of the convective envelope on the agb .",
    "sources of angular momentum for the envelope may be provided by companion stars / planets and the core of the star .",
    "first , at the expense of its orbital angular momentum , a low mass companion may feed angular momentum to the envelope during a common envelope phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the angular momentum of a companion of mass @xmath44 is given by @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is jupiter s mass and @xmath47 is the initial orbital separation .",
    "following @xcite , we may express the envelope s angular momentum as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant ( @xmath50 is appropriate for the upper agb ) .",
    "comparing eq.[eq : jp ] and eq.[eq : jenv ] shows that e.g. a @xmath51 companion star with an inital orbital separation of 1au may replace all of the rotational angular momentum lost by the envelope of a star with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "likewise , a @xmath56 companion star with an inital orbital separation of 1au may replace all of the rotational angular momentum lost by the envelope of a star with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the above illustrates that ( a substantial fraction of ) the angular momentum lost by the wind can in principle be replaced by a low mass companion star .",
    "second , @xcite argue that although the envelope of low- and intermediate - mass stars may be devoid of angular momentum ( i.e. non - rotating ) at the beginning of the thermally pulsing agb phase , stars with main sequence masses @xmath59@xmath60 can spin up their envelopes to rotational speeds of @xmath61 just prior to the pn ejection . here , the spin - up is caused by angular momentum from the core that _ leaks _ to the envelope during thermal pulses @xcite .",
    "the validity of our assumption of angular momentum conservation for the star thus remains to be seen .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate in the following section , if this condition is somehow met , some very important observational features of agb stars may be reproduced .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the scenario where the star s angular momentum is conserved , despite the uncertainty of this assumption .",
    "strictly speaking , the relationship found between @xmath24 and @xmath6 ( see fig.[fig : figure1 ] , lower panel ) is of course only valid for the @xmath27 agb star modeled above .",
    "still , it may not be unreasonable to assume that @xmath24 will in first order primarily depend on @xmath6 , since it is the deviation from axisymmetry of the agb star that leads to an axisymmetric envelope in the first place .",
    "if this assumption is correct , we may apply the obtained relationship to other stars as well , and generally study @xmath24 as a function of stellar parameters and evolution ( see below ) .",
    "if the assumption is invalid , the behavior of @xmath6 still provides information on the general behavior of @xmath24 for a given star , since deviations from spherical symmetry of the agb star will still be amplified in the dust condensation region . only the exact relation between @xmath6 and @xmath24",
    "may not be specified in this case .",
    "as agb stars evolve , their luminosity increases , while their mass and effective temperature decrease .",
    "following eq.[eq : rgrav2 ] , the effect of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is thus to increase @xmath6 ( i.e. lower the degree of axisymmetry ) over time , while the effect of @xmath1 will be to decrease @xmath6 ( i.e. increase the degree of axisymmetry ) over time . here",
    ", the stellar mass has the largest effect on @xmath6 and hence the axisymmetry in the envelope .",
    "while the luminosity of the star typically increases by a factor of 10 during agb star evolution , @xmath6 ( see eq.[eq : rgrav2 ] ) depends on @xmath62 , which only decreases by a factor of 3 .",
    "likewise , while @xmath6 depends on @xmath63 , the effective temperature typically decreases from 3500k to 2500k , so @xmath64 decreases at most by a factor 2 . in constrast",
    ", @xmath6 varies with the stellar mass as @xmath65 . assuming its tip of the agb envelope mass is @xmath66 , @xmath6 may therefore vary by a factor of about @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) over the lifetime of a @xmath27 ( @xmath41 ) star .",
    "the axisymmetry in the envelope will thus indeed be primarily affected by the stellar mass .       as a function of time for stars with initial masses of 1.5@xmath69 ( _ dashed _ ) , 3.5@xmath69 ( _ dashed dotted _ ) , 5.0@xmath69 ( _ dotted _ ) , and 7.0@xmath69 ( _ solid _ ) .",
    "for details see the main text . ]",
    "we now investigate the time evolution of @xmath24 under the influence of mass loss during the agb phase .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : figure2 ] for four stars with different main sequence masses .",
    "it is assumed that each star is spun - up to an initial rotational velocity of @xmath70 .",
    "this choice of initial rotational velocity ensures that , when combined with the other stellar parameters adopted for each star , @xmath6 is always in the range covered by the models of , therefore allowing a translation to @xmath24 to be made . after the spin - up",
    "each star has an initial luminosity of @xmath71 , an initial effective temperature of 3500k , an initial radius of @xmath72au , and an initial mass loss rate of @xmath73 .",
    "after spin - up , the stars lose mass according to @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the final mass loss rate , and the time @xmath76 is expressed in terms of the total agb lifetime , @xmath77 .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 may be found by specifying the onset of the sw phase , @xmath79 , which is also expressed in terms of @xmath77 .",
    "here we use @xmath80 where @xmath79 is estimated from detailed model results by @xcite , and @xmath77 and @xmath75 are adjusted such that the initial - final mass relation is satisfied for each star .",
    "then the mass of the star is found by @xmath81 the exact mass - loss rate as a function of time during the agb phase is unknown and difficult to determine .",
    "still , a key feature of it seems to be that most of the mass is lost near the end of the agb phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with our choice of @xmath82",
    "this condition is satisfied",
    ". we may now insert eq.[eq : mass ] into eq.[eq : rgrav2 ] to follow @xmath6 as a function of time .",
    "next , we use the results of fig.[fig : figure1 ] to translate @xmath6 into @xmath24 , yielding the results shown in fig.[fig : figure2 ] .",
    "note that we kept @xmath20 and @xmath21 constant at @xmath83 and @xmath84k in the above analysis ( where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not to be confused with @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) . as discussed earlier ,",
    "the effect of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are minor compared to the effects of the stellar mass .",

    "this result may naturally explain why most agb stars have spherically symmetric envelopes , while in the post - agb / pne phase axisymmetry seems common - place @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : figure2 ] also shows that the final degree of axisymmetry , i.e. the degree of axisymmetry at the end of the agb , increases with increasing main sequence mass .",
    "this result also seems to agree with observations .",
    "indeed , an optical imaging survey of post - agb stars by @xcite with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) seems to suggest that higher mass progenitor agb stars are more likely to show bipolar structure with a completely or partially obscured central star than low mass stars .",
    "this result seems to be reinforced by detailed radiative transfer calculations of @xcite for the post - agb stars hd161796 and iras17150 - 3224 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the onset of axisymmetry does not coincide with the onset of the sw phase .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : figure2 ] and table[tab : table1 ] .",
    "the onset of axisymmetry only becomes reasonably appearant ( i.e. @xmath24@xmath592 ) in the last few tens or hundreds of years , long after the start of the sw phase .",
    "this is in agreement with e.g. recent findings by @xcite .",
    "based on spitzer space telescope ( sst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations of ngc650 ( program id77 ) , @xcite shows that mass loss is nearly isotropic when the sw is turned on towards the end of the agb phase , and the sw mass loss precipitously decreases along the polar direction during the sw phase .",
    "the degree of axisymmetry that develops in the envelope will strongly depend on the initial rotational velocity of the agb star .",
    "generally , the rotation of single stars is expected to slow down significantly while they are on the main - sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and once these stars reach the agb phase they are believed to rotate too slowly for axisymmetries to develop . here , slow rotation is expected both with and without the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it is therefore often argued that a companion star is prerequisite to spin - up an agb star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanism adopted in this paper would benefit from the presence of such a binary companion , since it may spin - up the agb star , and be a source of rotational angular momentum for the agb star s envelope that is otherwise lost through the agb wind ( see sect.[sect : validityofassumptions ] ) .",
    "moreover , the requirement of a companion star would fit in nicely with the idea that binary interaction indeed plays an important role in shaping the axisymmetric structure of pne ( see sect.[sect : introduction ] ) , and recent observational results that strongly suggest that most or even all pne are in close binary systems @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in case of stars with main sequence masses @xmath59@xmath60 , the spin - up may be provided by angular momentum from the core of the agb star during thermal pulses ( see sect.[sect : validityofassumptions ] ) , in which case a companion star is not required .",
    "the thermal pulses will not provide the star with a spin - up at the start of the agb phase , since these pulses only occur late in the agb phase .",
    "however , they may efficiently spin - up the agb star near the end of the agb phase @xcite , during which the mechanism adopted in our paper may still apply . in this case",
    ", it seems more appropraite to use @xmath99 , since at the onset of the thermal pulses the mass of the envelope may already have been substantially reduced down to @xmath100 @xcite . here , the lower initial envelope mass will result in a lower degree of axisymmetry in the envelope , since @xmath6 ( see eq.[eq : rgrav2 ] ) will stay closer to unity .",
    "although the trends described for @xmath24 are in nice agreement with observations , the absolute values predicted for @xmath24 are somewhat low .",
    "for example , we predict a final value of @xmath101 for a @xmath102 main sequence star .",
    "in contrast , for the post - agb star hd161796 , which is believed to be of a low main sequence mass ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , @xcite find @xmath103 . also , we predict a final value of @xmath104 for a @xmath105 main sequence star , which is on the high mass end of agb stars .",
    "still , @xcite find for e.g. the high mass post - agb star iras17150 - 3224 @xmath106 , which is clearly much larger than predicted by our models .",
    "however , the trend of an increasing value of @xmath24 with increasing main sequence mass is the same",
    ".    there may be several reasons for our under - prediction of @xmath24 .",
    "first , the assumed initial rotational velocity of @xmath70 is rather low .",
    "as discussed earlier , this choice ensured that , when combined with the other stellar parameters adopted for our stars , @xmath6 is always in the range covered by the models of , therefore allowing a translation to @xmath24 to be made .",
    "this is a computational restriction however , and not a physical one .",
    "in fact , rotational velocities higher than we adopted may be expected ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "adopting a higher initial rotational velocity will increase @xmath24 .",
    "also , we have only considered the effects of mass thusfar .",
    "taking properly into account the effects of the luminosity and effective temperature of the star as well may also help increase @xmath24 .",
    "for example , we adopted a luminosity of @xmath83 for all stars .",
    "still , for stars with low main - sequence masses this luminosity may be too high .",
    "lowering it will help increase @xmath24 in this case . finally , the values of @xmath24 derived by @xcite for hd161796 and iras17150 - 3224 will depend on the details of their radiative transfer calculations .",
    "possibly , a different assumption of e.g. dust composition or grain size distribution may lower the values of @xmath24 derived by @xcite , in better agreement with our results .",
    "in this paper we addressed the temporal changes in the axisymmetry of agb star envelopes , and in particular the development of the torus that is required in the gisw model .",
    "for this purpose we considered the scenario of an agb star that rotates at a sufficient angular speed at the start of the agb phase .",
    "next , as the star evolves , we assumed that the rotational angular momentum of the agb star is somehow conserved .",
    "if the above condition is met , some very important observational features of agb star axisymmtery evolution may be reproduced .",
    "in particular compared to the star s increasing luminosity and decreasing effective temperature , the decreasing mass of the star primarily affects the axisymmetry of the envelope . adopting a representative mass loss history , where most of the mass is lost near the end of the agb phase , results in an increase of the envelope s axisymmetry over time .",
    "the strongest increase is only near the very end of the agb phase , explaining why most agb stars have spherically symmetric envelopes , while those of post - agb stars and pne are axisymmetric .",
    "also , the degree of axisymmetry at the end of the agb phase is found to increase with increasing main sequence mass , and the onset of axisymmetry only occurs after the onset of the sw phase .",
