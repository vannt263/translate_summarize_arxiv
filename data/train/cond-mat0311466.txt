    "during the past decade and a half there has been an intense search for new kinds of theories describing quantum condensed - matter systems .",
    "many experimental results have implied that strongly - correlated fermionic systems exhibit qualitatively new types of physical behavior .",
    "the now - classic example of this is the fractional quantum hall effect , where one of the striking consequences of strong correlations is that the laughlin quasiparticles have fractional charge and fractional statistics , even though though the microscopic degrees of freedom are electrons with integer charge and fermionic statistics [ ] .",
    "traditionally one classifies different phases in terms of order parameters which give a global characterization of the physical state . in turn",
    ", the local fluctuations of this order parameter field drive the phase transitions between ordered and disordered states of these systems .",
    "this viewpoint , pioneered by landau and his school , has been extremely successful in condensed matter physics and in other areas of physics , such as particle physics , through the powerful underlying concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking . much of the structure of modern theory of critical phenomena is based on this point of view [ ]",
    ".    however , there are many different experimentally - realizable phases ( and even more realizable theoretically ! ) in the fractional quantum hall effect , but no _ local _ order parameter distinguishes between them .",
    "these phases are incompressible liquid states which have a fully gapped spectrum and do not break any symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "the lack of a local order parameter led to many interesting discussions of the off - diagonal long - range order in the hall effect [ ] .",
    "one particularly elegant way of characterizing the order in the fractional quantum hall effect is as _ topological order _ [ ] .",
    "the topological order parameters are non - local ; they are expectation values of operators which are lines or loops . because of this",
    ", they can ( and do ) depend on topology : their value depends on the genus of the two - dimensional surface on which the electrons live .",
    "one interesting characteristic of a _ topological phase _ is that the correlation functions in the ground state do not depend on the locations of the operators , but only on how the loops braid through each other .",
    "in addition , the degeneracies of these non - symmetry breaking ground states on topologically non - trivial manifolds are determined by the topology of these manifolds [ ] .",
    "although so far the only unambiguous experimental realizations of topological phases are in the fractional quantum hall effect , there has been considerable effort to find , both theoretically and experimentally , condensed matter systems whose phase diagrams may exhibit topological ground states .",
    "much of the current work involves studying fractionalized phases in time - reversal invariant systems ( see e.g.  [ ] ) .",
    "one reason is that the",
    " normal state \" of high - temperature superconductors lacks an electron - like quasiparticle state in its spectrum .",
    "there are reasons to believe that frustrated magnets may also exhibit fractionalized behavior as well .",
    "a particularly well - known and simple model with a topological phase is the _ quantum dimer model _ , which was invented as a way of modeling the short - range resonating - valence - bond theory of superconductivity [ ] .",
    "the degrees of freedom of this two - dimensional model are classical dimers living on a two - dimensional lattice . with a special choice of hamiltonian ( called the rk point )",
    ", the exact ground - state wave function can be found [ ] .",
    "when the dimers are on the square lattice , the result is a critical point .",
    "if one deforms this special hamiltonian , one generically obtains ordered phases . however",
    ", a topological phase occurs in the quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice [ ] .",
    "when the quantum dimer model is in a topological phase , an effect analogous to fractionalization occurs [ ] .",
    "this is called spin - charge separation .",
    "one can view the dimers as being created by nearest - neighbor pairs of lattice electrons in a spin - singlet state . even though the fundamental degrees of freedom ( the electrons ) have both spin and charge",
    ", one finds that the basic excitations have either charge ( holons ) or spin ( spinons ) , but not both . to prove this occurs",
    ", one must show that if one breaks apart an electron pair ( dimer ) into two holons or two spinons , they are deconfined .",
    "for the triangular - lattice quantum dimer model , this was shown in ref . ;",
    "the analogous statement in terms of holon - holon correlators was proven in ref .. at a quantum critical phase transition between an ordered / confining phase and a disordered / deconfining phase ( or between different confining states ) , confinement is lost : the rk point is deconfining [ ] .",
    "the notion of spin - charge separation is one of the basic assumptions behind the rvb theories of high - temperature superconductivity [ ] , which effectively can be regarded as strongly - coupled lattice gauge theories . in @xmath1-dimensional systems spin - charge separation can only take place if these gauge theories are in a deconfined phase [ ] . in @xmath1-dimensions",
    "this is only possible for discrete gauge symmetries . for a continuous gauge group ,",
    "say @xmath2 or @xmath3 , @xmath1-dimensional gauge theories are always in a confining phase , unless the matter fields carry a charge higher than the fundamental charge so that the gauge symmetry is broken to a discrete subgroup [ ] .",
    "thus , the only consistent scenarios for spin - charge separation necessarily involve an effective discrete gauge symmetry , which in practice reduces to the simplest case @xmath0 .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that the low - energy sector of the deconfined phases of discrete gauge theories are the simplest topological field theories [ ] .",
    "many of these ideas have their origin in the conceptual description of confined phases of gauge theories as monopole condensates , and of their deconfined states as  string condensates \" [ ] . in gauge theories it has long been known that their phases can not characterized by a local order parameter , since local symmetries can not be spontaneously broken .",
    "the phases of gauge theories are understood instead in terms of the behavior of generally non - local operators such as wilson loops and disorder operators [ ] , a concept borrowed from the theory of the two - dimensional ising magnet [ ] .",
    "interesting as they are , the applicability of these ideas to the problem of high - temperature superconductivity and other strongly correlated systems is still very much an open problem .",
    "topological fractionalized ground states are not the only possible explanation of the unusual physics of the cuprates .",
    "in fact , when constructing local microscopic models of strongly - correlated systems which are suspected to have fractionalized phases , many theorists have found that instead these models have a strong tendency to exhibit spatially - ordered states , _",
    "_  valence bond crystals \" , which appear to compete with possible deconfined states .",
    "it is now clear that the regimes of strongly - correlated systems which may favor fractionalized phases also favor , and perhaps more strongly , non - magnetic spatially ordered states of different types , including staggered flux states [ ] , or @xmath4-density wave states [ ] , and electronic analogs of liquid crystalline phases [ ] .",
    "by now there are a number of examples of models with short - range interactions whose phase diagrams contain both fractionalized and spatially - ordered phases [ ] .",
    "it has recently been proposed that deconfined critical points may describe the quantum phase transitions between ordered nel states and valence bond crystals [ ] .    for several reasons ,",
    "most of the studies of topological order and quantum critical points have focused on examples with two spatial dimensions .",
    "the experimental reason is that the hall effect is two - dimensional , and typical strongly - correlated systems , such as the cuprate high - temperature superconductors , are often effectively two - dimensional . theoretically , it is because in two dimensions particles can have exotic statistics interpolating between bosonic and fermionic [ ] . a common characteristic of topological phases in two dimensions is the presence of exotic statistics , which occur in the fractional quantum hall effect [ ] .",
    "the statistics can even be non - abelian : in some cases , the change in the wave function depends on the order in which particles are exchanged [ ] .",
    "systems with non - abelian statistics are particularly interesting because they are useful for error correction in quantum computers [ ] .    in this paper we will discuss models with topological phases and ordered phases , as well as quantum phase transitions separating them .",
    "there has also been a great deal of interest in quantum critical points in and of themselves [ ] . at a quantum critical point ,",
    "the physics is of course scale invariant , but it need not be lorentz invariant .",
    "the quantum critical points discussed in this paper have dynamical critical exponent @xmath5 , instead of the usual @xmath6 of a lorentz - invariant theory .",
    "this allows for some striking new physics .",
    "the action of these @xmath5 quantum critical points is invariant under time - independent conformal transformations of the two - dimensional space .",
    "a remarkable consequence is that the _ ground - state wave functionals _ of the field theories discussed here are conformally invariant in space .",
    "this means that the ground state wave functional is invariant under any angle - preserving coordinate transformations of space . for two - dimensional space",
    ", there is an infinite set of such transformations , as is familiar from studies of two - dimensional conformal field theory [ ] . this sort of behavior is not common at all : the action of a field theory at a critical point is often scale invariant ( and also conformally invariant ) , but the ground - state wave functional itself in general is not .",
    "we dub critical points with this behavior _ conformal quantum critical points_.    one of the consequences of the conformal _ invariance _ of the ground state wave function is that all the equal - time correlators of the quantum theory are equal to suitable correlation functions of observables of a two - dimensional euclidean conformal field theory .",
    "we will exploit this connection in this paper quite extensively .",
    "however , just as important , conformal invariance of the wave function implies that the ground state of this @xmath1-dimensional theory at a conformal quantum critical point must have zero resistance to shear stress in the two - dimensional plane .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "consider an infinitesimal local distortion of the geometry of the two - dimensional plane represented by an infinitesimal change @xmath7of the two - dimensional metric , as is conventional in the theory of elasticity [ ] .",
    "let @xmath8 be the ground state wave function for the undistorted plane and @xmath9 be the ground state wave function in the distorted plane with two - dimensional metric @xmath10 . under this distortion",
    "the hamiltonian of the system changes by an amount @xmath11 to first order in perturbation theory in @xmath12 , the change of the ground state wave energy is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the exact ground state energy of the distorted system . on the other hand , the change of the norm of the ground state wave function @xmath15 is , to all orders in perturbation theory , given by [ ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ground state energy of the undistorted system .",
    "thus , the change of the norm @xmath15 is determined by the ( @xmath18 ) _ stress tensor _ @xmath19 of the @xmath1-dimensional theory @xmath20 on the other hand , we can regard @xmath21 as the partition function @xmath22 of a two - dimensional euclidean conformal field theory .",
    "this theory has an euclidean _ stress - energy _",
    "tensor , @xmath23 , defined by [ ] @xmath24 which essentially coincides with the _ stress _ tensor of the @xmath1-dimensional quantum field theory defined above .",
    "scale invariance , rotational invariance and conservation require that @xmath19 be a conserved ( divergence free ) symmetric traceless tensor .",
    "consequently , the effective hamiltonian ( as well as the action ) at this quantum critical point can depend on the spatial gradients of the field only through the  spatial curvature \" , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath25 in a scalar field theory .",
    "in other words , at a conformal quantum critical point for a scalar theory , the stiffness vanishes : the usual @xmath26 term is not possible .",
    "this means that the dynamical critical exponent of this quantum critical theory must be @xmath5 .",
    "we call such theories quantum lifshitz theories ; we will discuss such critical points in detail .",
    "in this paper we discuss lattice models which exhibit both ordered / confined phases and disordered / deconfined phases .",
    "we will also discuss the field - theory description of these phases and of the phase transitions . to simplify matters , and to be able to obtain exact results , we will introduce models whose ground - state wave function will be known exactly and whose properties we will be able to determine quite explicitly . in this sense , these models are a generalization of the quantum dimer model at the rk point .",
    "the basis of the hilbert space of these models is the configuration space of a two - dimensional classical statistical - mechanical system or euclidean field theory .",
    "each of these basis states is defined to be orthogonal with respect to the others .",
    "an arbitrary state in this hilbert space can therefore be described as some linear combination of these basis elements .",
    "describing the hilbert space in such a fashion is not particularly novel .",
    "the unusual feature of the models we will discuss is that the ground - state wave function can be expressed as in terms of the action or boltzmann weights of a _ local _ two - dimensional classical theory",
    ". the normalization of the wave function will then be the partition function or functional integral of the classical two - dimensional model .",
    "this special property is why the wave functionals at the critical points are have a time - independent conformal invariance at their critical points .",
    "the field theory of these conformal quantum critical points can be extended to describe nearby ordered and disordered phases , including their confinement properties .",
    "we will study this quite explicitly in a quantum generalization of the eight - vertex model .",
    "however , much of the physics we discuss should apply to topological phases and ( @xmath5 ) quantum critical points in general .",
    "we will also study theories with a continuous non - abelian symmetry .",
    "we show that , interestingly enough , it is very difficult to construct a non - trivial conformal quantum critical point with such a symmetry .",
    "we do find a hamiltonian whose ground state is the doubled chern - simons theory of ref .",
    "[ ] . this is a time - reversal invariant theory of interest in topological quantum computation and in ( ordinary ) supercondutivity ; it is in a gapped topological phase .    in section [ sec : scale - wf ]",
    "we discuss the simplest model with a scale - invariant critical wave function , the quantum dimer model at the rk point . here",
    "we also introduce the quantum lifshitz model , the effective field theory of these new quantum critical points . in section [ sec:2dwavefn ]",
    ", we generalize the relation between the quantum dimer model and the scalar field theory discussed in section [ sec : scale - wf ] to include perturbations which drive the system in to a quantum disordered / deconfined phase or to a ordered / confined phase . in section [ sec : q8v ] , we define the quantum eight - vertex model by finding a hamiltonian whose ground - state wave function is related to the classical eight - vertex model .",
    "this will allow us to find quantum critical lines with variable critical exponents separating a @xmath0-ordered phase from a topologically - ordered phase .",
    "it will also allow us to place a number of previously - known models , in particular that of ref .",
    "[ ] , in a more general setting .",
    "we show in detail how to use the known results from the baxter solution of the classical model to map out the critical behavior of the quantum theory .",
    "in particular we analyze in detail the confinement and deconfinement properties of the different phases and at criticality . in section",
    "[ sec : ymcs ] , we study the non - abelian case , and see that the strongly - coupled limit of yang - mills theory with a chern - simons term has a wave functional local in two - dimensional classical fields [ ] . this theory is in a phase with topological order . in three appendices",
    "we give details of the correlators of the quantum lifshitz field theory ( appendix [ app : gaussian ] ) , and of the gauge - theory construction of the quantum six - vertex ( appendix [ app : gauge ] ) and eight - vertex ( appendix [ app : z2gauge ] ) models .",
    "the simplest lattice model we discuss is the quantum dimer model ; the simplest field theory we dub the quantum lifshitz theory .",
    "they both provide very nice illustrations of the properties discussed in the introduction . in the quantum dimer model ,",
    "the space of states consists of close - packed hard - core dimers on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "a quantum hamiltonian therefore is an operator acting on this space of dimers , taking any dimer configuration to some linear combination of configurations . in every configuration",
    "exactly one dimer must touch every site , so any off - diagonal term in the hamiltonian must necessarily move more than one dimer . the simplest such operator is called a `` plaquette flip '' : if one has two dimers on opposite sites of one plaquette , one can rotate the dimers around the plaquette without effecting any other dimers .",
    "for example , for the @xmath27th plaquette on the square lattice one has @xmath28 the operator @xmath29 is defined as zero on any other dimer configuration around a plaquette ( i.e.  if the @xmath27th plaquette is not flippable ) .",
    "we define the operator @xmath30 as the identity if the plaquette is flippable , and zero otherwise .",
    "the rokhsar - kivelson hamiltonian for the quantum dimer model [ ] @xmath31 has the remarkable property that one can find its ground states exactly .",
    "they have energy zero , and every state ( in a given sub - sector labeled by global conserved quantities ) appears with equal amplitude in its ground - state wave function .",
    "these properties follow from the facts that @xmath32 is self - adjoint , and @xmath33 .",
    "hamiltonians of the form @xmath34 necessarily have eigenvalues @xmath35 obeying @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , if one can find a state annihilated by all the @xmath37 , then it is necessarily a ground state .",
    "the equal - amplitude sum over all states is indeed such a state . in the schrdinger picture ,",
    "the wave function for this state is easy to write down .",
    "define @xmath22 as the number of all dimer configurations in some finite volume .",
    "this is precisely the classical partition function of two - dimensional dimers with all configurations weighted equally .",
    "then the properly - normalized ground - state wave function for any basis state @xmath38 in the hilbert space ( any classical dimer configuration @xmath39 ) is @xmath40 the wave function of the quantum system is indeed related to the classical system .",
    "one can extend this sort of analysis to compute equal - time correlators in the ground state .",
    "one finds simply that these correlators are given by the correlation functions of the two - dimensional classical theory .",
    "thus for @xmath32 for dimers on the square lattice , one finds algebraic decay of the correlation functions [ ] . this model is then interpreted as a critical point between two ordered phases of the dimers [ ] .",
    "however , for the analogous hamiltonian on the triangular lattice , the classical two - dimensional correlators are exponentially decaying [ ] .",
    "one can also show that spinon - type excitations ( sites without a dimer ) are deconfined on the triangular lattice [ ] . this means the quantum dimer model with @xmath32 on the triangular lattice is interpreted as being in a `` liquid '' phase , which has a mass gap and exponential decay of interactions , but which has no non - zero local order parameter .",
    "such a relation between two - dimensional quantum theories is not limited to lattice models , nor are the ground - state wave functions required to be equal - amplitude sums over all configurations .",
    "we will construct now a simple ( non - lorentz invariant ) two - dimensional quantum critical field theory a theory whose ground state wave function represents a two - dimensional conformal theory .    consider a free boson @xmath41 in two spatial dimensions and one time dimension . instead of the usual hamiltonian quadratic in derivatives",

    "for this reason we will call the system with hamiltonian ( [ eq : hboson ] ) the _ quantum lifshitz model_. of particular relevance to our discussion is the long - ago observation by grinstein [ ] that this system is analogous to the two - dimensional euclidean free boson in that it represents a line of fixed points parametrized by @xmath46 .",
    "let us rederive this result by quantizing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hboson ] ) .",

    "the latter is a well - known conformal field theory , and its correlation functions are easily determined ( for convenience we give them explicitly in appendix [ app : gaussian ] ) .",
    "this two - dimensional critical field theory is conformally - invariant , so the equal - time correlators of the quantum theory must reflect this .",
    "this scalar field theory is therefore not only quantum critical but it also has a time - independent conformal invariance .",
    "the equal - time expectation values of the  charge operators \" @xmath67 $ ] , as well as the correlation functions of the dual vortex ( or  magnetic \" ) operators discussed in appendix [ app : gaussian ] , exhibit a power - law behavior as a function of distance , as expected at a quantum critical point .",
    "as shown also in appendix [ app : gaussian ] , their autocorrelation functions also exhibit scale invariance albeit with a dynamic critical exponent @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior of the equal - time correlator was shown earlier to occur in the quantum dimer model on the square lattice at the rk point : there is a massless `` resonon '' excitation , and the equal - time correlation functions for two static holons has a power law behavior equal to that of the monomer correlation function in the classical 2d dimer model on the square lattice .",
    "however , not all theories whose ground state can be found in this fashion need be critical with power - law behavior . as noted above , the quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice is not . as we will discuss in section [ sec:2dwavefn ] , adding say a mass - like term to @xmath55 in the scalar field theory gives a theory with exponentially - decaying correlations in the ground state",
    ". thus one can understand phase transitions in such theories as well , and we will explore several of these in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that when the quantum phase transition is continuous , the quantum critical points of generic theories of this type will have the basic structure of the quantum lifshitz model .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , only quantum lifshitz points can be conformal quantum critical points . and",
    "anisotropic 3d classical lifshitz points was considered recently in refs .",
    "[ ] . ]    in the next sections we will show that generalizations of this @xmath5 quantum lifshitz hamiltonian also describe the quantum phase transitions between generalizations of the valence bond crystal states and quantum disordered states which describe deconfined topological fluid phases ( provided these quantum phase transitions are continuous ) .",
    "notice that phase transitions from deconfined to confined , uniform and translationally - invariant states are described by the standard lorentz invariant @xmath6 critical point of gauge theories [ ] .",
    "these examples show that one can obtain precise information about some 2d quantum systems in terms of known properties of 2d classical systems .",
    "the trick of doing so is in finding a set of @xmath37 ( or @xmath55 in the continuum ) which annihilates the equal - amplitude state ( or some other desired state ) , and then defining @xmath68 [ ] .",
    "this seems like it should be possible to do for any classical 2d theory , and indeed , there are many known examples of this sort .",
    "however , it is not clear for a given 2d classical theory one can always find a hamiltonian which is both local and ergodic ( in this context , ergodic means that the hamiltonian will eventually take the system through all of phase space with a given set of conserved quantum numbers ) .",
    "it is also not clear that even if such a hamiltonian exists , whether it will have any physical relevance .",
    "moreover , this simple relation of the ground - state wave function of a 2d quantum system to a 2d classical system is not at all generic : the quantum dimer model with @xmath32 and this quantum lifshitz field theory are quite special . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us discuss briefly the ground - state wave functions of standard quantum field theories at a ( quantum ) critical point .",
    "consider first the most common case , the lorentz invariant @xmath69 field theory at criticality .",
    "below @xmath70 space - time dimensions this critical theory is controlled by its non - trivial wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "the resulting theory is massless and in general it has an anomalous dimension @xmath71 .",
    "scale and lorentz invariance fully dictate the behavior of _ all _ the correlation functions at this fixed point .",
    "general fixed point theories are scale invariant and , in addition , they exhibit an enhanced , generally finite - dimensional , conformal symmetry . it is a very special feature of @xmath72-dimensional lorentz - invariant fixed point theories that they exhibit a much larger , infinite - dimensional , conformal invariance .",
    "this enhanced symmetry leads to a plethora of critical behaviors in @xmath73 dimensions .",
    "in contrast , there are relatively few known distinct critical points in higher dimensions for lorentz - invariant field theories .",
    "it is well known that the knowledge of all the equal - time correlation functions determines completely the form of the ground state wave function , _",
    "i.e. _ in the schrdinger representation of the field theory [ ] . for a general theory , the ground - state wave function is a non - local and non - analytic functional of the field configuration .",
    "thus , at the wilson - fisher fixed point , which describes theories with only a global conformal ( scale ) invariance , the structure of the ground state wave function is quite complicated .",
    "for instance , the probability of a constant field configuration @xmath74 at a critical point has the universal form [ ] @xmath75 for a lorentz - invariant @xmath69 theory the universal critical exponent is given by @xmath76 , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are two non - universal constants .",
    "therefore , at criticality the wave function in general is a non - analytic non - local functional of the field configuration .",
    "in contrast , the ground - state wave function of a @xmath73-dimensional relativistic interacting fermions ( a luttinger liquid ) , which is a conformal field theory , has a universal non - local non - analytic jastrow - like power law factorized form [ ] consistent with the form found by the bethe - ansatz solution of the calogero - sutherland model [ ] . this structure is a consequence of the ( local ) conformal invariance of the @xmath73-dimensional theory . even in @xmath73 dimensions ,",
    "the wave function is generically non - local .",
    "in section [ sec : scale - wf ] , we showed how to find the exact ground - state wave functions of the quantum dimer model with rokhsar - kivelson hamiltonian @xmath32 , and the quantum lifshitz scalar field theory . in this section",
    ", we will describe their properties in more detail , and some simple generalizations .",
    "the ground states of @xmath32 are the sum over all classical dimer configurations in a sector with equal amplitudes [ ] .",
    "there are a number of useful generalizations to models where the ground state is still a sum over all states in a sector , but not necessarily with equal amplitudes .",
    "one interesting case is a quantum dimer model which interpolates between the square and triangular lattices .",
    "a triangular lattice can be made from a square lattice by adding bonds across all the diagonals in one direction .",
    "the classical dimer model on the square lattice can be deformed continuously into the triangular - lattice model by assigning a variable weight @xmath79 for allowing dimers along these diagonals : for @xmath80 we have the original square - lattice model , while @xmath81 gives the triangular - lattice one [ ] . there is a two - dimensional quantum hamiltonian which has the @xmath79-dependent classical dimer model as its ground state . for dimers on opposite sides of a plaquette of the original square lattice , the hamiltonian remains @xmath32 .",

    "precisely , its partition function and correlators can be written in terms of the pfaffian ( the square root of the determinant ) of known matrices [ ] .",
    "one can rewrite the pfaffians in terms of a functional integral over grassmann variables at every site on the lattice [ ] .",

    "another useful fact is that ( ignoring boundary conditions ) , a dirac fermion can be described in terms of two decoupled ising field theories . in the continuum , the holon can be written in terms of the product of the spin field in one ising model with the disorder field in the other ising model .",
    "taking @xmath79 away from zero amounts to giving one ising order field an expectation value , and the other disorder field an expectation value .",

    "we will also show that the energy of a state with two static sources grows linearly with their separation .",
    "we should also note here that the equal - time fermion correlation function has an exponential decay in this phase , suggesting that this phase may support massive fermionic excitations .",
    "2 .   _ the disordered ( deconfined ) phase _ : + from the exact solution of the classical model , we know that there is a _ disordered _ phase for @xmath261 ( @xmath262 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ eight ] ) .",
    "this is also a _ deconfined _ phase .",
    "this is most easily seen by taking a point deep in this phase , such as the kitaev point @xmath205 [ ] . in fact , all along the line @xmath170 and @xmath182 , the correlation length of the eight - vertex model is zero [ ] .",
    "all points in the disordered phase have this line as their rg stable fixed point ( all points on the line are equivalent ) .",

    "e. _ long - distance ) sector of this phase describes a _ topological _ @xmath0 deconfined theory , equivalent to the kitaev point .",
    "critical behavior _ : + the 2d _ quantum _ theory has lines of critical points @xmath210 ( and @xmath211 ) .",

    "notice that , since the energy of this quantum state is exactly zero ( by construction ) , the ground - state energy does not have singularities at the phase transitions .",
    "this is of course a peculiarity ( or rather a pathology ) of this model and it certainly non - generic : any perturbation leading to a non - vanishing energy will lead to singularities in the energy of the ground state .    in section [ critft ]",

    "thus near to the critical lines the effective field theory will be of the form ( [ qsg ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : hqq ] ) ; these field theories will have the correct critical exponents .",

    "unfortunately , these correlation functions can be computed exactly only along the free - fermion lines , by using pfaffian techniques .",
    "likewise correlation functions of off - diagonal operators ( _ e.g. _ flip operators ) can only be determined at some special points deep in the ordered and disordered phases by using directly the quantum eight - vertex hamiltonian . however , at or near the critical lines , the asymptotic behavior of the correlators can be found by using universality .",

    "the topological properties of the doubled theory have been recently discussed in depth by freedman _",
    "let us attempt first to construct a non - abelian version of the quantum lifshitz theory , which one might hope would still be a quantum critical theory .",
    "we will follow the same procedure as in the abelian case .",
    "since there are many two - dimensional euclidean critical points with non - abelian symmetry , the first thing to try is the above procedure for making a two - dimensional quantum theory from a two - dimensional classical theory .",
    "this procedure is indeed fairly general .",
    "one can easily construct a set of a appropriate projectors @xmath37 in a lattice model without local constraints .",
    "however , the caveat `` without constraints '' is quite important : many interesting classical lattice models have local constraints like in the dimer model and in the six- and eight - vertex models .",
    "this means that one must find a flip operator which respects the constraints .",
    "there is no guarantee that there is a set of flips which are both local and ergodic .",
    "this is particularly apparent in models where the two - dimensional degrees of freedom are closed loops . at a critical point , arbitrarily - long loops are an important part of the configuration space , so one must construct some sort of flip which still acts non - trivially but locally on these loops . in the continuum limit ,",
    "it is easy to imagine such flips , but it is not always obvious how to make them act consistently on the lattice .",
    "nevertheless , the rokhsar - kivelson hamiltonian and the quantum eight - vertex model provide examples of models where one can solve this problem .    for field theories ,",
    "the issue is similar .",
    "if a theory has an action @xmath153 and one ignores constraints such as gauge invariance , one can easily find projection operators @xmath55 which annihilate the state weighted by @xmath353 .",
    "for a single field @xmath44 , we have @xmath354 and the hamiltonian is defined via eq .",
    "( [ eq : hqq ] ) .",
    "this @xmath59 is hardly unique : one can multiply it on the left by any operator without changing the ground state .",
    "it is important to note that this construction is not always easy to implement .",
    "many interesting two - dimensional field theories do not have a simple - to - describe action : they are usually defined instead in terms of representations of an infinite - dimensional symmetry algebra such as the virasoro algebra , arising from conformal invariance [ ] .",
    "for example , the action of a @xmath355 coset model ( _ e.g. _ a conformal minimal model ) is written as a gauged wzw model such as we will discuss below ; one must then worry about the constraints of gauge invariance .    a point we wish to emphasize , however , is that even if one succeeds in constructing such a hamiltonian , the @xmath1-dimensional theory may be qualitatively very different from the classical two - dimensional theory .",
    "for example , the classical theory may be critical and have algebraically - decaying correlators , but the quantum theory may have exponentially - decaying correlators in the ground state .",
    "the reason is that quantum - ground - state correlators are weighted by @xmath99 , not @xmath356 . for the models discussed above",
    ", this has effects which are easy to take account of : it is the reason that the axes in figure [ eight ] are labeled by @xmath238 and @xmath239 instead of @xmath168 and @xmath4 .",
    "if however @xmath356 has a complex part , the effects can be much more dramatic .",
    "let us first discuss the simplest two - dimensional classical field theories with a non - trivial non - abelian symmetry .",

    "simple lie groups @xmath352 are curved : for example , @xmath3 as a manifold is isomorphic to a three - sphere .",
    "moreover , one finds that the trivial fixed point at @xmath365 is unstable , and the model has a finite correlation length proportional to an exponential in @xmath366 .",
    "correlators decay exponentially , not algebraically .",
    "the phenomenon where a naively dimensionless coupling becomes dimensionful due to loop corrections is known in the particle physics literature as dimensional transmutation ; it is familiar in condensed - matter physics in the kondo problem and the hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "another reason a gap should appear is that the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem does not allow goldstone bosons in two euclidean dimensions .",
    "one would obtain @xmath367 in a theory as the low - energy limit of a fermionic theory where one attempts to spontaneously break the chiral symmetry @xmath359 to its diagonal @xmath368 subgroup .",

    "this satisfies the theorem by having the low - energy excitations get a mass and restoring the symmetry to the full @xmath370 .",

    "the wzw model is critical , so one might guess that the quantum version with this wave function would also be critical , in the fashion of the theories in the previous sections .",

    "these correlators decay exponentially .",
    "we do note that when the level @xmath381 , one can use an alternate method to find the 2d wzw correlators in the ground - state of a quantum theory .",
    "all the fields of @xmath382 can be written in terms of @xmath383 free bosons [ ] .",
    "the combination of the corresponding quantum lifshitz theories will then have the @xmath382 correlators in its ground state .",
    "likewise , @xmath384 and @xmath385 can be written in terms of free majorana fermions .",
    "since the different bosons or fermions here do not interact , the physics is the same as that discussed earlier ; in particular the model is essentially free , and the excitations are abelian .",
    "since it is not possible to have a wave functional with @xmath386|^2 = e^{-i[g]}$ ] , we will need to work harder to find how the physics of the wzw model can arise in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "a connection between the wzw model and the wave functions of @xmath1-dimensional chern - simons gauge theory has long been known [ ] .",
    "chern - simons theory without any matter fields is a topological field theory : the physical states are wilson and polyakov loops , and their correlation functions do not depend on distance but only on topological properties of the loops .",
    "these correlators can be expressed in terms of the verlinde numbers , which also describe the ( chiral ) fusion rules of the wzw model [ ] .",
    "these topological field theories have been discussed in detail in many places .",
    "one discussion of issues closely related to those of interest here is the recent work of freedman _",
    "[ ] ; we will discuss the relation of our results to this paper in the next subsection .    in this subsection we will describe a wave functional which after squaring and averaging over fields indeed yields the wzw partition function .",
    "we will show that this wave functional is the ground state of a 2 + 1-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "this all sounds like exactly what we want for a quantum critical point , but in a gauge theory , physical observables must be gauge invariant .",
    "gauge - invariant states will turn out to have a gap , and gauge - invariant correlators in the ground state will be exponentially decaying . introducing a gauge field therefore will not yield a quantum critical point with non - abelian symmetry .",
    "it will yield , however , something just as interesting : an explicit hamiltonian for a theory in a topological phase .    before discussing construction of these wave functionals , which was done in great detail by witten [ ] and",
    "whose construction we will follow here , it is worthwhile to discuss first its physical meaning and to emphasize some well - known facts of chern - simons gauge theories [ ] .",
    "the ground state wave function of any field theory can be viewed as the quantum mechanical amplitude of some arbitrary state into the vacuum ( or ground state ) , _ i.e. _ what we normally call the vacuum state in a given representation . as such",
    "this amplitude is the functional integral of the quantum field theory on an open manifold bounded by the initial time surface .",
    "however , the partition function of a topological gauge theory such as chern - simons is only gauge invariant on a manifold without boundary .",
    "thus , the ground state wave function has a gauge anomaly . nevertheless , if the wave function is used to compute expectation values of _ gauge - invariant observables _ , the result is gauge invariant .",
    "the reason is that the computation of expectation values ( as well as all inner products ) involves the conjugate wave function , _",
    "i.e. _ the amplitude to evolve from the vacuum state in the remote past into the chosen state at the fixed time surface .",
    "consequently , the gauge anomaly cancels in the computation of the expectation values of gauge - invariant operators . in this way , at a formal level , the computation of expectation values leads to a formally  doubled \" theory even though the number of degrees of freedom has not changed . in subsection",
    "[ sec : doubled ] we will discuss a physically doubled theory which has a formal relation with what we do in this subsection .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the technical issues involved in this problem : the relevant discussion for the analysis done in this paper can be found in refs .",
    "we should note here that the gauge anomaly of the wave function is formally ( mathematically ) analogous to the gauge anomaly of chern - simons theory on manifold with a spatial edge . in the latter ,",
    "the anomaly is physical : to cancel the anomaly the gauge - invariant theory must include physical degrees of freedom residing at this @xmath73-dimensional boundary . in the incompressible fractional quantum hall fluid , this results in physical edge states [ ] .",
    "another important fact is that , since chern - simons gauge theory is a topological field theory , the partition function on a closed space - time manifold is independent of the metric . however , the boundary of the manifold and the choice of polarization break the general coordinate invariance of chern - simons theory .",
    "in particular , the choice of holomorphic polarization induces a conformal structure in the wave functional [ ] which is absent in other polarizations [ ] .",
    "we will see that the conformal wave function arises naturally in a specific theory , the strong - coupling limit of the yang - mills chern - simons theory .",
    "the wave functional of interest was discussed in depth by witten [ ] .",
    "it involves the wzw field @xmath357 coupled to a gauge field @xmath387 taking values in the lie algebra of @xmath352 .",

    "in other words , we find that the circulation around the plaquette at @xmath563 is given by @xmath566 .    in principle",
    ", we could go on to describe the eight - vertex model in a similar fashion .",
    "the main difference with the six - vertex model is that the constraint is no longer satisfied .",
    "one can introduce a matter field which has no - zero values on the @xmath4 vertices .",
    "in addition , a flip term which flips every plaquette has to be constructed . this flip term has to commute with the new constraint .",
    "it turns out that this is indeed possible , but the flip term will involve the conjugate of the matter field .",
    "also , one would need a potential term which gives weights plaquettes according to the vertices present on the plaquette .",
    "however , as there is a more natural gauge description , which is based on the @xmath567 symmetry of the eight - vertex model , we will discuss and use that description of the quantum eight vertex model in the next appendix .",
    "in this appendix , we will discuss a @xmath567 gauge theory which can be viewed as an extension of the kitaev model which incorporates vertex weights differing from unity .",
    "the model we will discuss is of the rokhsar - kivelson type , but it is not the simplest quantum generalization of the classical eight - vertex model , as we pointed out in section [ sec : q8v ] .      in this model , spins living on the bonds of the square lattice are the degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , on every link of the square lattice , we define a pauli algebra of @xmath568 hermitian matrices @xmath569 , where @xmath570 labels the three pauli matrices , and for a lattice site @xmath295 , we denoted the orientation of the link by @xmath571 ( @xmath283horizontal and @xmath284vertical ) .",
    "( thus , the degrees of freedom live half - way between the lattice sites @xmath295 and @xmath572 , where @xmath573 is a unit vector along the direction @xmath193 . )",
    "in what follows we will take the states @xmath574 ( an  up \" spin ) and @xmath575 ( a  down \" spin ) as the states which diagonalize @xmath323 ( instead of @xmath576 , as it is customary ) .",
    "the relation with the eight - vertex model is simple .",
    "up - spins correspond to arrows pointing up or to the right , while down spins correspond to arrows pointing down or to the left . around each vertex",
    ", the number of up - spins has to be even . in this section",
    ", we will denote the vertex by @xmath295 and the associated plaquette by its south - west corner @xmath295 .    for details , see ref .",
    "the constraint can written in a simple form @xmath577 the term which flips all the arrows around a plaquette can be written in terms of @xmath578 s @xmath579 this flip operator commutes with the constraint , because a vertex and a plaquette have either @xmath116 or @xmath118 common bonds .",
    "hence , both operators can be diagonalized simultaneously . in the model considered by kitaev [ ] ,",
    "equal weight is given to all types of vertices , so no term in the hamiltonian is required . to go beyond the point @xmath205 , we need a term which will weight the plaquettes according to the types of vertices present .",
    "thus , we will need to introduce operators which can discern among the various vertices .",
    "in addition , the  weight \" of the vertex depends on its position in the plaquette under consideration .",
    "let us start by giving the terms which give a non - zero contribution for @xmath580 and @xmath4 vertices respectively ( but zero otherwise ) .",
    "let us define the  vertex magnetizations \" @xmath581 with this notation , the projectors onto the vertices @xmath105 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath4 are just the squares of the vertex magnetizations of eq .",
    "( [ vms ] ) : @xmath582 it is straightforward to show that these operators act as projection operators on vertices of type @xmath105 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath4 respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ they yield @xmath120 when acting on the corresponding vertex and zero otherwise .",
    "it is elementary to check that @xmath583 where @xmath584 is the identity operator .",
    "we can now write down the potential term which assigns weights to the plaquettes in the same way as done by the projectors of section [ sec : q8v ] . flipping",
    "a plaquette will change a @xmath4 vertex to an @xmath105 vertex if the @xmath4 vertex is in the south - west or north - east `` even '' corner of the plaquette .",
    "a @xmath4 at the other `` odd '' corners will go to a @xmath167 under the flip . in short , @xmath585 , @xmath586 . for @xmath168 s",
    "this is opposite , namely @xmath587 , @xmath588 .",
    "the potential term will involve all four vertices around a plaquette , and thus we need to distinguish between the different position in the plaquette .",
    "this is achieved by the following , albeit rather cumbersome , term @xmath589 the potential term assigns potential energies to the plaquettes in the same way as is done by the projectors of section [ sec : q8v ] .",
    "that is , the potential is the product of vertex weights obtained by flipping the plaquette , divided by the product of the vertex weights of the plaquette itself . as mentioned before , the two - body terms only couple spins on the same sublattice .",
    "the most non - local terms in the potential energy term consist of eight - body interactions .",
    "of course , a plaquette potential energy term of this sort is needed , if one assigns weights to plaquettes as given in eq .",
    "respects rotational invariance ; the apparent asymmetry is due to the use of the vertex weights as labels . ] .",
    "note that for @xmath170 and @xmath182 ( or @xmath590 ) , the eight - body terms cancel each other .",
    "however , there will remain four and six - body interactions , which will mix different sublattices .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the @xmath567 gauge theory of the quantum eight vertex model is @xmath591 where the two terms are given by and .",
    "the states in this model have to satisfy the constraint .",
    "we can check these formulas in a few limits . for",
    "@xmath205 , each factor in will be @xmath120 when acting on states satisfying the constraint .",
    "hence , the potential term became the identity operator , which merely results in an energy shift , and thus we find back the kitaev model , as we must .",
    "another interesting limit is @xmath592 . as was discussed in section [ sec:8vqh ] , this limit gives a slight generalization of the six - vertex model , in the sense that plaquettes which have @xmath247 or @xmath248 will have finite energy , and they can be interpreted as static defects . as can be seen from the potential term [ q8vpotsig ] , plaquettes which have @xmath241 will be suppressed as they receive infinite energy .",
    "the flip term has to be modified , because we need to have a flip term which commutes with the constraint , which has become a stronger statement in the six - vertex case , namely ( c.f .",
    "@xmath593 the flip term which preserves the six - vertex constraints is @xmath594 where the raising and lowering operators ( in the representation we use ) are given by @xmath595 to make contact with the flip term for the eight - vertex model , we rewrite eq .   as @xmath596 the flip term for the six - vertex model is therefore precisely the flip term for the eight - vertex model minus the terms which cause the six - vertex constraint to be violated .",
    "it is easily checked that the six - vertex flip term eq .",
    "commutes with the constraint .",
    "we thus find that on the level of the wave function , the limit @xmath592 is smooth , as the amplitude of the configurations which contain @xmath4 vertices goes to zero .",
    "in addition , for @xmath597 , the flip term commutes with constraint , while for @xmath181 , the flip term commutes with the @xmath2 constraint .",
    "thus , the symmetry is enhanced from @xmath567 for @xmath598 to @xmath2 for @xmath181 , as was to be expected .",
    "we now have a rokhsar - kivelson generalization of the eight - vertex model , in a gauge - theory language .",
    "we can use this representation of our model to study the various phases .",
    "however , this is more easily done in a dualized version , as the dual takes the form of an ising model . in the dual picture , the spin degrees of freedom will live on the sites of dual square lattice , _ i.e. _ the centers of the plaquettes of the direct lattice .",
    "thus , we will label by @xmath563 the site of the dual lattice on the center of the plaquette labeled by @xmath295 ( its sw corner ) .",
    "of course , the potential term in the dual language will still be quite formidable .",
    "we will denote the dual pauli operators by @xmath599 and @xmath292 . to start with the flip term",
    ", the product of @xmath576 s around a plaquette becomes @xmath599 on the plaquette [ ] @xmath600 to see what happens with the constraint and the projector operators defined by eq .",
    "( [ vms ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ p - s ] ) we need the dual form of the @xmath323 s living on the links . in term of the dual variables",
    "@xmath292 , and using the notation of fig . [ fig : dual ] , the @xmath323 s are given by @xmath601    we thus easily find that the constraint is automatically satisfied ( again , going to the dual picture amounts to solving the constraint ) . also , it is trivial to show [ ] that the inverse relation , _ i.e. _ to express the dual lattice @xmath292 operators in terms of the @xmath323 operators of the original lattice is @xmath602 where @xmath603 is a set of links of the direct lattice pierced by a path @xmath604 on the _ dual _ lattice ending at the dual site @xmath563 ( but which is otherwise arbitrary ) ; see fig . [ dual - path ] .",
    "note that we need to choose the spin on one of the plaquettes ; all the others are subsequently determined by the @xmath605 s on the links . in terms of the dual variables , the projection operators for site @xmath295 , defined by eq .  ,",
    "take the form @xmath606 where @xmath607 and @xmath608 are given by @xmath609    the interaction in terms of these projectors has the same structure as in the spin representation of the classical eight - vertex model : it consists of two - body terms on interpenetrating sublattices , and a four - body term coupling the two sublattices .",
    "all the two - body interaction terms will only couple spins on the same sublattice .",
    "the four- and six - body interaction terms ( of which there are many ! ) , couple the sublattices .",
    "the same holds for the eight - body term , naturally .",
    "the dual form of the theory is @xmath610 where @xmath290 is given by , but now with the projectors given in eq .  .",
    "thus , formally this theory takes the form of a ( multi - spin ) ising model in a transverse field .",
    "however , the two - body interactions only couple spins on the same sublattices , together with the multi - spin terms conspire to change the quantum critical behavior from the conventional @xmath6 lorentz - invariant criticality of the standard ising model in a transverse field to the @xmath5 quantum critical behavior discussed in the rest of this paper .",
    "now that we found the dual version of our gauge theory , we would like to discuss the limits @xmath205 and @xmath181 . again , the first limit brings us back to the kitaev point , because the potential term becomes the identity operator again , and we are left with the very simple spin flip term of eq .",
    ", @xmath611 .",
    "the limit @xmath592 is however more complicated in this dual gauge theory .",
    "first of all , we now do need a constraint , which was not present for @xmath597 .",
    "moreover , the flip term now only can act , depending on the surrounding spins .",
    "let us start by dualizing the constraint eq .  , which results in @xmath612 obviously , the eight - vertex flip term @xmath613 does not commute with this constraint . to find a flip term which does commute with the constraint , we dualize the six - vertex flip term , which results in @xmath614 the factors in bracket",
    "can be seen to give a non zero result only on plaquettes which are flippable .",
    "hence , this flip term commutes with the constraint .",
    "of course , this can also be checked explicitly .",
    "apart from a factor @xmath615 , there are factors depending on the @xmath292 s coming form both the flip term and the constraint .",
    "the signs in this product conspire in such a way to render the commutator zero ."
