    "a dynamical system in contact with a reservoir has been a subject of wide attention in dissipative dynamics and irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the focal theme lies on the possible link between the rate of phase space volume contraction and the thermodynamically inspired quantities like entropy production , entropy flux , onsager coefficients etc . @xcite .",
    "while on the other hand it has been argued that the entropy production is related to the intrinsic properties of phase space structure of the dynamical systems through the lyapunov exponents @xcite , the traditional wisdom asserts that entropy production in a class of thermostatted hamiltonian system is defined @xcite as the work per unit time ( in the leading order ) done on the system by an external constraint under nonequilibrium steady state condition .",
    "recently based on a markovian description of a stochastic process daems and nicolis @xcite have critically analysed the two aspects from the consideration of an information entropy balance equation .",
    "the object of the present paper is to extend the treatment to colour @xcite and cross - correlated noise processes @xcite and to search for an appropriate signature of an intrinsic interplay between the noise properties of these processes and the dissipative characteristics of the dynamical system in the steady state entropy production and flux .",
    "we specifically consider the overall system to be open , i. e. , the noises are of external origin such that they do not , in general , satisfy fluctuation - dissipation ( f - d ) relations .",
    "whenever possible we allow ourselves to make a fair comparison with the standard results for closed systems .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we consider two types of external , stationary and gaussian noise processes namely , the ornstein - uhlenbeck and cross - correlated noise processes in terms of a fokker - planck description and set up an entropy balance equation to identify the drift term which reveales that in addition to dissipation constant it contains the essential properties of noise processes . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to explicit examples to calculate the entropy production .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "the langevin equations of motion in phase space for an n - degree - of - freedom system which is driven by the external colour noise process @xmath0 can be written as    @xmath1    @xmath2 is the number of degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "@xmath3 is the damping constant for i - th degree of freedom .",
    "@xmath4 are the corresponding co - ordinate and the momentum , respectively . while the presence of @xmath3 imparts a dissipative character in the dynamics , the stochastic forcing @xmath0 ensures a canonical distribution at equilibrium when the fluctuation - dissipation relation is satisfied .",
    "@xmath5 is hamiltonian of an initially the conservative system and is given by @xmath6    the masses of all the degrees of freedom have been set to unity .",
    "@xmath7 is the potential of the hamiltonian system .",
    "the term @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) refers to an external , gaussian colour noise for the i - th degree of freedom and follows the two time correlation function    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the correlation time and @xmath10 is the noise strength .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath0 can be conveniently expressed in terms of the white noise process @xmath11-for the i - th component    @xmath12    @xmath13    in case there exists no fluctuation - dissipation relation between @xmath3 and @xmath0 the system described by the eq .",
    "( 1 ) is sometimes termed as thermodynamically open @xcite .",
    "eq.(4 ) implies that @xmath0 can be treated as a phase space variable on the same footing as @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "thus the original @xmath16 dimensional stochastic system ( 1 , 3 ) now becomes a @xmath17 dimensional markovian process where eq .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) are written in a compact form    @xmath18    where @xmath19 @xmath20    and    @xmath21    the fokker - planck equation @xcite corresponding to langevin eq.(5 ) can be written as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the extended phase space probability distribution function .",
    "the extension is due to the inclusion of @xmath2 noise variables due to the external agency as phase variables .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that the above formulation contains the thermodynamically closed system as a special case where the internal noise strength @xmath10 is related to dissipation @xmath3 through the relation @xmath25 , where @xmath26 refers to the equilibrium temperature of the reservoir .",
    "next we consider a dynamical system driven by both additive and multiplicative noise processes @xmath0 and @xmath27 , respectively . the langevin equation for this process , in general",
    ", can be written as    @xmath28    @xmath29 contains the dissipative term as well as the external applied deterministic force , if any .",
    "@xmath30 is the coupling between the system and the multiplicative process . @xmath27 and @xmath0 are white , gaussian noise processes with the following correlation between them ;    @xmath31    @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the strength of multiplicative and additive noises , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 represents the cross correlation between them with the limit @xmath35 . the cross correlation between these noise processes",
    "is known to cause symmetry breaking leading to non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite in spatially extended systems and generate interesting ratchet motion @xcite in systems with symmetric potential under isothermal condition .",
    "the fokker - planck equation corresponding to langevin eq.(8 ) can be written as    @xmath36    where the drift for the @xmath37-th component @xmath38 is    @xmath39 +   d_{ii } ' \\frac{\\partial g_i^2(x_i)}{\\partial x_i } + 2 \\lambda_{ii } \\sqrt{\\alpha_{ii } d_{ii } ' } \\frac{\\partial g_i(x_i)}{\\partial x_i } \\label{e11}\\ ] ]    @xmath40 stands for the stratonovich and @xmath41 for the ito convention , respectively .",

    "information entropy @xmath49 is formally defined in terms of the phase space distribution function @xmath24 through the well - known relation    @xmath50    the above definition allows us to have an evolution equation for entropy . to this end",

    "the subscript @xmath56 of @xmath57 refers to steady state .",
    "it is therefore evident from eq.([e17 ] ) that    @xmath58    note that since we consider the system to be dissipative @xmath59 is negative and therefore @xmath54 turns out to be positive .",
    "it is now interesting to examine the entropy production when the dissipative system is thrown away from the steady state due to an additional weak applied force . to this end",
    "we consider the drift @xmath60 due to external force so that the total drift @xmath61 has now two contributions :    @xmath62    when @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath65 from @xmath57 in presence of nonzero small @xmath66 can be explicitly taken into account once we make use of the identity for the diffusion term @xcite    @xmath67 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left [ p_s \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\frac{p}{p_s}\\right ]   \\ ; \\ ; . \\label{e20}\\ ] ]    when @xmath64 the second term in ( [ e20 ] ) vanishes . in presence of additional forcing the eq.([e10 ] ) becomes , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70    here we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath42 is not affected by the additional forcing .",
    "the leading order influence is taken into account through the additional drift term in eq.([e21 ] ) .    under steady state condition @xmath71 and @xmath63 ,",
    "the second and the third terms in ( 21 ) vanish yielding    @xmath72    it is immediately apparent that @xmath73 refers to a current @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the steady state condition therefore reduces to an equilibrium condition ( @xmath76 ) if @xmath77 ( in the next section we shall consider two explicit examples to show that @xmath78 ) .",
    "this suggests a formal relation between @xmath79 and @xmath42 as @xmath80 where @xmath57 may now be referred to as the _ equilibrium _ density function in phase space .",
    "@xmath79 contains dissipation constant @xmath81 .",
    "depending on the problem it also depends on the correlation time @xmath9 of the colour noise or on the cross correlation @xmath82 between the noise processes .    to consider the information entropy balance equation in presence of external forcing we first differentiate eq.([e14 ] ) with respect to time and use eq.([e21 ] ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite one can show that in the new steady state ( in presence of @xmath83 ) , the entropy production ( @xmath84 ) and the flux ( @xmath85 ) like terms balance each other as follows : @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88    where we have put @xmath89 .    in the following section we shall work out the specific cases to provide explicit expressions for the entropy production and some related quantities due to external forcing for different kinds of open systems mentioned in the last section .",

    "we thus have    @xmath119    explicit evaluation shows @xmath120    where @xmath110 is given by eq.(38 ) .",

    "two different cases are noteworthy ;    \\(a ) @xmath148 or @xmath149 :    when relaxation time of the system greater than correlation time of external noise the entropy production @xmath84 decreases with increase of @xmath147 until @xmath150 .",

    "a plot of entropy production in the steady state vs correlation time therefore exhibits a minimum ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . it is thus apparent that in presence in presence of the nonequilibrium constraint the properties of noise processes as well as the dynamic characteristic of the system are important for entropy production .",

( 69 ) implies that for finite @xmath173 entropy production is an increasing function of the cross correlation ( i.e @xmath158 ) between the two noise processes .",
    "in this paper we have examined the role of noise properties of stochastic processes in entropy production under a steady state condition . as specific cases we have considered ornstein - uhlenbeck noise with finite correlation time and cross - correlated noises driving the dynamical system .",
    "based on an information entropy balance equation we have shown that the entropy production and flux like terms not only depend on the dissipative characteristics of the dynamics of the phase space of the dynamical system , particularly , the rate of phase space volume contraction , but also on the correlation time and strength of cross correlation of the noises . since the steady state entropy production is identified as a drift term in the fokker - planck description in the present formalism and the correlation time or the strength of cross - correlated noises make their presence felt in this term , it is not difficult to trace the origin of the role of interplay of dissipation and the properties of the noise processes . in view of the fact that the ornstein - uhlenbeck noise processes or the cross - correlated noise processes are commonly occurring situations in condensed matter physics and chemistry , we hope that the present analysis will be useful in irreversible thermodynamics in relation to dynamical systems , in general ."
