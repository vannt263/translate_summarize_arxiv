    "this paper is devoted to study some statistical aspects of the stabilization problem for two and three - dimensional oseen equations with help of feedback control defined on a part of the boundary that restricts a domain where the equations are determined .",
    "since for stabilization problem the case of unstable equations is interesting , we assume that oseen equations possess a solution that is exponentially growing as time @xmath0 , i.e. the solution is unstable .",
    "new approach to the problem of stabilization by feedback control was proposed by one of the authors of this paper in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "namely , construction of stabilization from a part of boundary for parabolic equation , 2d oseen equations as well as for 2d and 3d navier - stokes system was created in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this construction reduces solution of a stabilization problem to solving a mixed boundary value problem defined on an extended domain with zero dirichlet boundary conditions and with initial condition belonging to a stable invariant manifold defined in an neighborhood of steady - state solution , near which we stabilize our system . in the case of ( linear ) oseen equations , steady state solution equals to zero and invariant manifold is replaced on subpace @xmath1 invariant with respect to resolving semigroup and such that the solution going out initial condition @xmath2 tends to zero as time @xmath0 with the rate @xmath3 or faster .",
    "evidently , aforementioned mixed boundary value problem is not stable because if @xmath4 then solution @xmath5 outgoing @xmath6 goes away from @xmath1 ( and goes away from zero ) even if @xmath6 is arbitrarily close to @xmath1 . that is why straightforward application of proposed construction of stabilization to numerical simulation may not be successful , because unpredictable fluctuations inevitably arise in real calculations .",
    "this situation was analysed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite with help of the concept of real process introduced there .",
    "the method of damping of unpredictable fluctuations by some feedback mechanism was worked out in these papers and an estimate of stabilization for real process was obtained .",
    "this estimate is informative only when a norm of stabilized real process is not too small .",
    "but when this norm has the same order as norms of unpredictable fluctuations , aforementioned estimate became uninformative .",
    "actually in this situation behavior of stabilized real process became chaotic .",
    "the goal of this paper is just to investigate the behavior of stabilized real process in small neighborhood of zero .",
    "more precisely , we solve the problem of retention of stabilized flow near unstable state of equilibrium .",
    "to do this we impose additional assumption on unpredictable fluctuations .",
    "we suppose that they are independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables with probability distribution supported in a small neighborhood of origin for phase space . then the real process is described by a random dynamical system and forms a markov chain .",
    "our aim is to prove that this markov chain is ergodic , i.e. it possesses unique stationary measure invariant with respect to the corresponding markov semigroup .",
    "this gives us the possibility to calculate by well known formulas the statistical characteristics of stabilized real process and to make clear its behavior using these formulas .    during the last few years uniqueness of invariant measures for 2d navier - stokes equations",
    "have been proved by f.flandoli , b.maslovski @xcite , s.kuksin , a.shirikyan @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , w.e , j.mattingly , ya.sinai @xcite , s.kuksin @xcite , duan and goldys @xcite , and other authors .    to prove ergodicity of indicated markov chain we use recent results of s.kuksin , a.shirikyan @xcite and s.kuksin @xcite on uniqueness of invariant measures for 2d navier - stokes equations with random kick - forces where coupling approach was applied .    actually , it is enough for us to verify that random dynamical system arising in stabilization construction indicated above satisfies all conditions imposed in @xcite , @xcite on random dynamical systems .",
    "in section 2 we recall necessary information on stabilization method . in section 3",
    "we formulate the main results and present conditions imposed in @xcite , @xcite on random dynamical systems in a form convenient for our situation . in sections 4 - 6",
    "we verify that these conditions fulfil for rds corresponding to stabilization proceedure .",
    "we thank s.b.kuksin and a.shirikyan for useful discussion on ergodicity of navier - stokes equations .",
    "we thank also m.s.agranovich for allowing us to read the proof of his result announced in @xcite and formulated in lemma [ lemagr ] below before its publication .",
    "in this section we recall briefly results of @xcite-@xcite used below .",
