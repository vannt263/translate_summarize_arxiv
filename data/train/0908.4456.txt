    "quantum chromodynamics is the highly successful theory of the strong interaction of elementary particles .",
    "it is based on @xmath2 yang - mills theory , which is a non - abelian gauge theory invariant under the gauge group @xmath2 , and a set of spin-@xmath3 quarks , which form the fundamental representation of the gauge group .",
    "the @xmath2 degrees of freedom are referred to as `` color . ''",
    "the high - energy behavior of yang - mills theory is well - understood and leads to a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "gross , wilczek@xcite , and politzer @xcite discovered that at high energies ( or short distance scales ) , the interaction strength of yang - mills fields decreases to zero , a property known as asymptotic freedom .",
    "however , qcd is not well understood at low energies or large distance scales , i.e. , those comparable to @xmath4 ( @xmath5 cm ) , at which point perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "the interaction strength increases , and the energy required to separate quarks becomes infinite .",
    "this leads to the property of confinement , which is exhibited by the experimental absence of free quarks , but has not been demonstrated theoretically . at energy scales",
    "less than @xmath4 , qcd has to be replaced by an effective theory of composites of quarks in the form of color - neutral hadrons .",
    "the low - energy behavior of qcd can be examined through the effective potential .",
    "the effective potential is a function of the background yang - mills field which is minimized by the absolute lowest energy state of the physical system .",
    "this minimum defines the physical vacuum .",
    "the physical vacuum is considered trivial when the effective potential takes a minimum with a zero background yang - mills field .",
    "if the minimum of the effective potential occurs when the yang - mills field is non - zero , the vacuum state will consist of a non - zero background field . the first attempt to study the yang - mills vacuum in this manner was by savvidy@xcite in 1977 .",
    "savvidy introduced a background chromomagnetic field of constant field strength lying in the cartan algebra of the lie group @xmath6 .",
    "he found that the minimum of the one - loop effective action occurs at a non - zero value of the background field , which causes the vacuum to be infrared unstable .",
    "it was later pointed out by h.b .",
    "nielsen and p. olesen @xcite that the chromomagnetic vacuum discovered by savvidy has an energy density with an imaginary part , which implies that it has a tachyonic mode , leading to instability of the vacuum .",
    "further corrections@xcite were made to the chromomagnetic vacuum to show that the energy is lower when the chromomagnetic vacuum consists of tube - like domain structures , with the chromomagnetic field pointed along the axis of each tube .",
    "the finite width of the tubes serves as an infrared cutoff , which destroys the low - energy instability .",
    "the minimum energy density of this type of state has been found by @xcite to be a superposition of domains separated by a fixed distance .",
    "this model is known as the `` spaghetti vacuum . ''",
    "it is important to note that these calculations pertain to a chromomagnetic field in flat space . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the related problem of the stability of the yang - mills vacuum on a curved space .",
    "the addition of the curvature will make the operator corresponding to the second variation of the action positive definite for large enough values of curvature , which will change the tachyonic mode into a physical state and cause the vacuum to stabilize .",

    "instead of having eigenvalues that are linear in the magnetic field , our results show that on the two - sphere , the lowest eigenvalue of the laplacian will increase quadratically with the magnetic field and quadratically with the radius of the sphere , leading to the counter - intuitive result that the space most closely approximating the flat - space saviddy vacuum will have a minimum eigenvalue that will be farthest from being unstable .",
    "this effect is a topological phenomenon that requires further study .",
    "the next step in examining this model should be to calculate the full effective potential as a function of both the strength of the chromomagnetic field and the radius of the sphere .",
    "the absolute minimum of the effective potential would yield the absolute vacuum state of yang - mills . in our case",
    ", we would find a state that would be at least a local minimum of the vacuum , and possibly the absolute minimum .",
    "in this section , we find the eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath172 of the operator @xmath189 .",
    "they are given by regular solutions of the equation \\{--",
    "_ l } u ( ) = 0 .",
    "the label @xmath170 on @xmath172 is only a label here .",
    "it s allowed values will be found later . introducing the change of variables",
    "@xmath229 , the equation becomes u(x ) = 0 .",
    "we may make the substitution u(x ) = ( 1-x)^(1+x)^f(x ) , where = || , = || . to get the equation & & \\{(1-x^2 ) - [ ( 2- 2 ) + ( -2 - 2 - 2)x ] + & & + } f(x ) = 0 . by switching variables to @xmath230",
    ", we obtain the hypergeometric equation & & \\{z(1-z ) + [ ( 1 + 2 ) - 2(1 + + ) z ] + & & + [ ---(+ ) ^2 + r^2 ] } f(z ) = 0 .",
    "finally , introducing the notation a^= + + ( 1 + 4r^2)^1/2 , we obtain the solution f(z ) = f(a^+,a^- ; 1+|m - k| ; z ) , where the function @xmath231 is the hypergeometric function @xcite [ hypergeofn ] f(a , b;c;z ) = _ n=0^z^n .",
    "the notation @xmath232 denotes the pochhammer symbol ( a)_n = . in our case , it is easy to show that @xmath233 and @xmath234 , so the expression ( [ hypergeofn ] ) will diverge at @xmath235 unless the series terminates @xcite .",
    "regular solutions will exist only in the degenerate case when the series terminates and the hypergeometric function becomes a polynomial .",
    "this happens when at least one of the first two arguments of @xmath231 is a negative integer .",
    "thus , the only regular solutions occur when a^- = + + - ( 1 + 4r^2)^1/2 = -q , q = 0,1,2,  where @xmath236 is a non - negative integer .",
    "this yields the eigenvalues [ lambda ] = ( + + q ) ( + + q + 1 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath237 takes on the values + = \\{|m+k| + |m - k| } = \\{|m|,|k|}. then it can be directly seen from ( [ lambda ] ) that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath238 is _",
    "0 =     for integer values of @xmath163 , the quantity @xmath237 is always integer , and so the eigenvalues are [ eval_int ] _",
    "l = ( |k|+l)(|k|+l+1),l = 0,1,2,  degeneracies of these eigenvalues can be counted using ( [ lambda ] ) , ( [ eval_int ] ) , and the fact that @xmath96 is an integer . for any given value of @xmath170 , the @xmath239 cases @xmath240 correspond to @xmath241 .",
    "the @xmath242 cases @xmath243 correspond to @xmath244 , respectively .",
    "counting these cases , the total degeneracy @xmath245 of @xmath172 from ( [ eval_int ] ) is d_l = 2(|k|+l ) + 1 .",
    "first consider the case when @xmath237 is half - integer .",
    "the eigenvalues are then _",
    "l = ( |k|+l)(|k|+l+1),l = 0,1,2,  in this case , we must have @xmath246 , which corresponds to the cases @xmath247 .",
