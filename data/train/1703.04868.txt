    "in 1983 , vaughan jones discovered the famous jones polynomial that was an essentially new way of studying knots .",
    "it turned out that the explanation of the jones polynomial has to do with quantum theory .",
    "the interested reader is referred to other articles @xcite .",
    "lomonaco and kauffman introduced a knot mosaic system to set the foundation for a quantum knot system in the series of papers @xcite .",
    "their definition of quantum knots whose basic building block is a mosaic system , was based on the planar projections of knots and the reidemeister moves .",
    "they model the topological information in a knot by a state vector in a hilbert space that is directly constructed from knot mosaics .",
    "the authors , lee and lee have announced the progress of the research program on finding the total number of knot mosaics in the series of papers @xcite . we have developed a partition matrix argument to count small knot mosaics , and also generalized this argument to give an algorithm for counting all knot mosaics that uses recurrence relations of so - called state matrices .",
    "this algorithm is further generalized for the enumeration of finite two - dimensional regular lattice objects such as independent vertex sets @xcite , which is an outstanding unsolved combinatorial problem in statistical mechanics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a combinatorial extension of the definition of knot mosaics to graph theory , and an application of the algorithm for the enumeration of embedded graph mosaics . throughout this paper , a _ graph mosaic _ means a mosaic regular projection of embedded graphs ( possibly multiple components ) with vertices of valence 3 and 4 in 3-space @xmath0 .",
    "the requirement on the number of valence is necessary to superpose in mosaic shapes .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the set of the following sixteen symbols that are called _ graph mosaic tiles _ as in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this definition is an extended version of the definition of mosaic tiles for knots @xcite , which are the first eleven tiles @xmath2 through @xmath3 .",
    "the other five tiles are used to represent the vertices of valence 3 and 4 of a graph .        for positive integers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , an _",
    "@xmath6mosaic _ is an @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 of graph mosaic tiles .",
    "note that the set of all @xmath6mosaics has @xmath9 elements .",
    "a _ connection point _ of a graph mosaic tile is defined as the midpoint of a tile edge that is also the endpoint of a portion of a graph drawn on the tile .",
    "note that graph mosaic tile @xmath2 has no connection point , @xmath10 through @xmath11 have two , @xmath12 through @xmath13 have three , and @xmath14 through @xmath3 and @xmath15 have four .",
    "a mosaic is called _ suitably connected _ if any pair of graph mosaic tiles lying immediately next to each other in either the same row or the same column have or do not have connection points simultaneously on their common edge .    a _",
    "graph @xmath6mosaic _ is a suitably connected @xmath6mosaic without connection points on the boundary .",
    "then this graph @xmath6mosaic represents a specific graph diagram having vertices of valence 3 and 4 .",
    "three figures in figure [ fig2 ] represent a @xmath16mosaic , a graph @xmath17mosaic and the trefoil knot @xmath18mosaic .",
    "one of the natural problems in studying mosaic theory is the enumeration of certain type of mosaics .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the total number of graph @xmath6mosaics .",
    "remark that equivalent embedded graphs are counted as distinct if they are represented as mosaics in distinct ways .",
    "originally , lomonaco and kauffman proposed the problem finding the number of all knot mosaics @xcite . indeed",
    "the total number of knot mosaics indicates the dimension of the hilbert space of so - called quantum knot mosaics . in this paper",
    ", we present an algorithm producing the exact value of @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the sum of the hamming weights of the binary expansions of integers @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the hamming weight of the binary number is the number of 1 s in the string .",
    "for example , @xmath23 because the binary expansions of 11 and 14 are 1011 and 1110 . denote that @xmath24 is the identity matrix of size @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the lucas number .",
    "[ thm : graph ] for positive integers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the total number @xmath27 of all graph @xmath28mosaics is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath31entry of the @xmath32 magnified state matrix @xmath33 recursively obtained by @xmath34 for @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , where the @xmath37 state matrices @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are recursively obtained by @xmath42 @xmath43 for @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "due to theorem [ thm : graph ] , we get table [ tab1 ] of the first 8 terms of the precise values of @xmath47 .    1.21.1    .list of @xmath47 [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for a suitably connected @xmath6mosaic @xmath48 , we define an _ @xmath49state _ of @xmath50 by @xmath51 , and similarly define an _ @xmath52state _ of @xmath50 . for example , @xmath53 oxxoxxxo and @xmath54 oxoxoxoo for @xmath55 drawn in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that @xmath56 has possibly @xmath57 kinds of @xmath49states and @xmath57 kinds of @xmath52states .",
    "we arrange the elements of the set of all states in the reverse lexicographical order as before .",
    "a _ magnified state matrix _ @xmath33 for @xmath56 is a @xmath32 matrix @xmath58 where each entry @xmath30 is the number of all suitably connected @xmath6mosaics that have the @xmath59-th @xmath49state and the @xmath60-th @xmath52state in the set of @xmath57 states .    like a checkerboard",
    ", we divide @xmath33 into @xmath61 submatrices @xmath62 , @xmath63 , each of which indicates a @xmath37 state matrix for the set of suitably connected @xmath6mosaics that have the @xmath64-th @xmath65state and the @xmath66-th @xmath67state in the set of @xmath68 states .",
    "we write @xmath69 $ ] as a @xmath70 matrix whose entries are also @xmath37 matrices .",
    "all submatrices are related to all possible @xmath61 choices of @xmath65states and @xmath67states .",
    "[ prop : mn ] for the set @xmath56 of all suitably connected @xmath6mosaics , the associated magnified state matrix @xmath33 is obtained by @xmath34 for @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "note that for the initial condition of this recursion formula , we may start at @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "we use induction on @xmath5 .",
    "first , we establish the magnified state matrix @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "a suitably connected @xmath77mosaic has two choices of @xmath65state and @xmath67state each among x or o. these letters are related to the last letters of the words of the @xmath49state and the @xmath52state of the mosaic .",
    "therefore the 11quadrant of @xmath75 counts only suitably connected @xmath77mosaic whose ( @xmath65state , @xmath67state ) is ( x , x ) .",
    "this means that it is @xmath38 .",
    "similarly the 12 , 21 and 22quadrants of @xmath75 are @xmath41 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath78 $ ] , @xmath79 , satisfies the statement .",
    "we follow the proof of proposition 3 in @xcite with some extension .",
    "let @xmath80 be a suitably connected @xmath81mosaic in @xmath82 .",
    "also let @xmath83 be the suitably connected @xmath84mosaic obtained by deleting the rightmost column of @xmath80 , and @xmath85 be the suitably connected @xmath77mosaic obtained by taking only the rightmost column of @xmath80 .",
    "then the @xmath86state of @xmath83 must be the same as the @xmath87state of @xmath85 as shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "let @xmath88 $ ] for @xmath89 . now consider the 21quadrant of @xmath90 , for example .",
    "its entries are @xmath91 submatrices @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 . associated suitably connected @xmath95mosaics @xmath80 have the following property that the last letters of their @xmath49states and @xmath52states are o and x , respectively .",
    "this means that the @xmath65state and the @xmath67state of the rightmost column @xmath85 are o and x , respectively as drawn in the figure .",
    "furthermore the associated @xmath83 must have the @xmath64-th @xmath65state and the @xmath66-th @xmath67state where @xmath96 and @xmath97 for this example .",
    "this is because the @xmath64-th state and the @xmath66-th state are obtained from the words of the @xmath98-th state and the @xmath99-th state by ignoring their last letters o and x , respectively .",
    "let @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 . among suitably connected @xmath95mosaics counted in each entry @xmath104 ,",
    "the number of such mosaics whose @xmath86state of the @xmath105-th column ( or equally @xmath87state of the rightmost column ) is the @xmath106-th state in the set of @xmath107 states is the product of @xmath108 and @xmath109 . since all @xmath107 states can be appeared as states of connection points where @xmath83 and @xmath85 meet , we get @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that @xmath111",
    ". therefore @xmath112 similarly we multiply @xmath38 , @xmath41 and @xmath40 instead of @xmath39 for the 11 , 12 and 22quadrants of @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "we finish the proof .",
    "each suitably connected @xmath6mosaic of @xmath56 can be extended to several graph @xmath28mosaics by adjoining proper graph mosaic tiles surrounding it , called boundary graph mosaic tiles , as illustrated in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "indeed the number of all possible extended graph mosaics only depends on the number of connection points on the boundary edges .",
    "for example , as drawn in the figure , there are exactly three ways to extend to graph mosaics if a suitably connected mosaic has two connection points on the boundary .",
    "this is a different aspect to knot mosaics , for which there are always two ways to extend regardless of the number of connection points on the boundary , known as the two fold rule .",
    "let @xmath50 be a suitably connected @xmath6mosaic that has @xmath65 connection points on the boundary .",
    "we name these connection points by @xmath118 clockwise on the boundary . to get a new graph @xmath28mosaic , we adjoin @xmath119 boundary graph mosaic tiles surrounding @xmath50 so that the new one has to be also suitably connected and does not have connection points on the new boundary . as drawn in figure [ fig8 ] , each pair of consecutive connection points , say @xmath120 ( we use 1 for @xmath121 if @xmath122 ) , is either joined by an arc on the boundary tiles between them or not .",
    "the former is called _ bridged _ and the latter _",
    "unbridged_. the right figure illustrates simplified graphical symbols of arcs on a portion of boundary graph mosaic tiles . note that any successive pairs @xmath123 and @xmath124 can not be unbridged simultaneously because of suitable connectedness .",
    "@xmath125 is indeed the number of all possible choices of determining bridged or unbridged on @xmath65 pairs of consecutive connection points with a restriction that any successive pairs can not be unbridged simultaneously .",
    "the readers find that @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 by simple drawings ( figure [ fig7 ] explains @xmath126 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath128 so that 1 and @xmath129 are different",
    ". now we give a pictorial proof as illustrated in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "we consider three situations of @xmath50 each of which has @xmath65 , @xmath130 or @xmath129 connection points on its boundary edges for counting @xmath125 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "the left five stacks in the figure indicate all five possibilities of bridged or unbridged on three pairs @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 of consecutive connection points between @xmath136 and 1 .",
    "the middle three stacks and the right two stacks indicate all three and two possibilities of bridged or unbridged on two pairs @xmath133 and @xmath137 , and a pair @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "focus on the line segments indicating bridged or unbridged on the upper three stacks of the left and the middle figures .",
    "we notice that , in each line segment , both pairs @xmath133 s for @xmath125 and @xmath131 are simultaneously either bridged or unbridged , and also both pairs @xmath139 for @xmath125 and @xmath137 for @xmath131 are simultaneously either bridged or unbridged . in each case ,",
    "@xmath125 and @xmath131 involve the same number of choices of determining bridged or unbridged on their rest @xmath140 pairs @xmath141 through @xmath142 extended properly .",
    "this implies that the total number of choices associated with these upper three cases among @xmath125 choices is exactly the same as @xmath131 .",
    "now consider the line segments on the bottom two stacks of the left and the right figures .",
    "in both figures , two pairs @xmath133 and @xmath135 for @xmath125 and a pair @xmath138 for @xmath132 are simultaneously either bridged or unbridged . in each case",
    "we have the same number of choices determining bridged or unbridged on the rest pairs as before .",
    "this implies that the total number of choices associated with these two cases among @xmath125 choices is the same as @xmath132 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be any positive integers . consider the set @xmath56 of all suitably connected @xmath6mosaics and the associated magnified state matrix @xmath144 , @xmath145 , obtained from propositions  [ prop : m1 ] and [ prop : mn ] .",
    "by the definition of the magnified state matrix , each entry @xmath30 counts the number of all suitably connected @xmath6mosaics that have the @xmath59-th @xmath49state and the @xmath60-th @xmath52state in the set of all @xmath57 states .",
    "note that the total number of elements of @xmath146 is the sum of all entries of @xmath33 because all rows represent all @xmath57 @xmath49states and all columns represent all @xmath57 @xmath52states of mosaics of @xmath56 .    from the definition of the order of states , the @xmath59-th state in the set of @xmath57 states",
    "is obtained as follows : ( 1 ) take the binary numeral system of @xmath21 , ( 2 ) replace the numbers 0 and 1 by the letters x and o , respectively , ( 3 ) write the word in reverse , and then ( 4 ) adjoin the letter x repeatedly at the end of the word until the total number of the letters of the word is @xmath147 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the total number of letter 1 s appeared in the binary numeral systems of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this guarantees that a suitably connected mosaic that has the @xmath59-th @xmath49state and the @xmath60-th @xmath52state has @xmath20 connection points on the boundary .",
    "therefore each suitably connected mosaic of @xmath146 that has the @xmath59-th @xmath49state and the @xmath60-th @xmath52state can be extended to exactly @xmath148 graph @xmath28mosaics . by proposition [ prop :",
