    "recent discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in soft gamma - repeaters @xcite may be opening up an exciting possibility into studying neutron stars by methods of seismology .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the crustal torsional vibration frequencies are determined by the shear modulus of the solid neutron star crust .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to calculate this quantity .",
    "the bulk of the neutron star crust is made of fully ionized ions ( of varying charge @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 ) in crystalline state , immersed in a nearly uniform strongly degenerate electron gas . more specifically",
    ", the ions form a crystal , if the local temperature @xmath3 falls below the melting temperature @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the ion sphere radius ( @xmath7 is the ion number density , @xmath8 ) .",
    "typically one assumes that the ion crystal is of body - centered cubic ( bcc ) type , as this structure is preferable thermodynamically for strictly uniform electron background .",
    "the state of the electron subsystem depends on matter density .",
    "we shall limit ourselves to such ( not too low ) densities , where electrons are degenerate and ions are completely pressure ionized ( @xmath9 g @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the ion mass number ; see for discussion * ? ? ?",

    "at these densities the model of uniform charge - compensating background of electrons is reasonably good .",
    "it gets progressively better with the growth of density becoming especially accurate at @xmath12 g @xmath10 , where electrons are ultrarelativistic .",
    "the crystal of fully ionized ions with the uniform background of electrons is known as the coulomb crystal .    in inner crust , at densities above the neutron drip density @xmath13 g @xmath10 , in addition to the coulomb crystal of ions and electrons , there are neutrons not bound in the atomic nuclei .",
    "the details of neutron interactions with nuclei are not known very well .",
    "it seems plausible that the properties of a strictly static crystal , i.e.  a crystal with nuclei fixed at their lattice nodes , are determined by coulomb forces .",
    "by contrast , the motion of nuclei about the lattice nodes may be affected by the presence of neutrons .",
    "lacking a good model of this effect , we shall assume that it can be described by an effective nucleus mass and renormalized ion plasma frequency within the framework of the coulomb crystal model .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is thus to study the shear modulus of the coulomb crystal .",
    "the groundwork for this problem was laid down by @xcite , who calculated the shear modulus of the static bcc coulomb lattice .",
    "more recently , @xcite calculated the shear modulus of the bcc coulomb crystal taking into account the motion of ions about their lattice nodes . in that work",
    "shear modulus was found numerically with the aid of monte carlo simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by the nature of the method ,",
    "the motion of ions was treated classically .",
    "@xcite further remarked that quantum effects were not important due to the smallness of the ion plasma temperature compared to the typical lattice electrostatic energy .",
    "finally , @xcite calculated the shear modulus of the coulomb crystal taking into account weak electron screening in the thomas - fermi model .",
    "this calculation was done numerically using molecular dynamics method . again",
    "the motion of ions was strictly classic .",
    "in this paper we shall use the thermodynamic perturbation theory to find the shear modulus of the coulomb crystal with ion motion included in the harmonic lattice model framework .",
    "unlike numerical methods of @xcite and @xcite this approach is capable of tackling quantum effects .",
    "the quantum effects are known to be important especially for lighter elements at higher densities .",
    "quantum effects in the problem of coulomb crystal elastic moduli are studied for the first time .",
    "in addition to the outermost envelope of the external crust , the coulomb crystal model fails in the ` nuclear pasta ' region of the inner crust at densities @xmath14 g @xmath10 , where nuclei become nonspherical .",
    "estimates of the shear modulus in this layer were reported by @xcite .    besides neutron star crusts , the coulomb crystals are expected to form in solid cores of white dwarfs , to which the present results thus also apply .",
    "a coulomb crystal is composed of ions with charge @xmath1 , arranged in a crystal lattice with equilibrium lattice sites @xmath15 , immersed in a rigid background of electrons ( charge @xmath16 ) .",

    "we have extended our calculations into this temperature range for the sake of a qualitative discussion .",
    "obviously , the further we go into the overheated crystal regime , the less accurate our results become due to the growing importance of anharmonic effects . in accordance with the general picture of fig .  [ mu_ph ] , where the phonon contribution into the effective shear modulus is negative and grows by absolute value with temperature , the total effective shear modulus drops and , eventually , reaches zero at @xmath272 .",

    "[ mu_tot ] by the dashed line .",
    "the electron screening was described by the thomas - fermi ( tf ) model . by its nature",
    "the molecular dynamics approach does not take into account quantum effects .",
    "we observe a decrease of the shear modulus ( with respect to the classic dotted curve ) reflecting the fact that the crystal with screened coulomb potential is less tightly bound than the pure coulomb crystal .",
    "it is well known that to lowest order in electromagnetic coupling , the screening by relativistic degenerate electrons is described by the ( rpa ) dielectric function of @xcite . the resulting effective ion - ion potential is more complex than the simple yukawa potential arising in the tf model .",
    "electron screening affects both properties of the static lattice and the phonon modes .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the tf model overestimates the correction to the lattice electrostatic energy as compared to the more accurate rpa model .",
    "by contrast , the properties of the phonon modes obtained in the tf and rpa models are very similar . since the main contribution to the effective shear modulus comes from the electrostatic energy ,",
    "we expect , that calculations of @xcite in the tf model overestimate the importance of the electron background compressibility . it would be interesting ( and is not difficult ) to calculate the electrostatic contribution to the effective shear modulus using the full rpa model .",
    "we have calculated elastic shear coefficient @xmath159 and effective direction averaged shear modulus @xmath162 for neutron star crust matter .",
    "both coefficients are sums of a static lattice term and a term originating from the motion of ions about their lattice nodes .",
    "while the static lattice contributions ( table [ fuchs ] ) were well known previously , only numerical simulations existed for the ion motion terms . using thermodynamic perturbation theory , we have expressed the ion motion terms via integrals over the first brillouin zone of quantities given by rapidly convergent lattice sums , eq .  ( [ stabgl ] ) .",
    "the integrals were then evaluated numerically and the results were fitted by simple analytic formulae , eqs .",
    "( [ fit ] ) and ( [ fits ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of the numerical methods ( monte carlo and molecular dynamics ) is their ability to include anharmonic effects to all orders .",
    "the main advantage of the perturbation theory is its ability to include quantum effects ( within the framework of the harmonic lattice model ) , greater transparency of the results and much lesser computer time requirements .",
    "the anharmonic effects can also be taken into account in the perturbative approach , but that would make all the equations much more cumbersome even if only the lowest order anharmonic term is retained . summarizing , we can say that numerical simulations and perturbation theory ideally complement each other as well as serve for mutual verification .",
    "if quantum effects are included , one finds that the ion motion contribution can be decomposed into two parts .",
    "one of them corresponds to zero - point ion motion and is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the other corresponds to thermal ion motion and is @xmath273 at low temperatures and @xmath0 at high temperatures .",
    "the high @xmath3 asymptote is what one obtains , if the calculation is purely classic . at low temperatures",
    "the thermal term is negligible compared to the zero - point term , and thus the @xmath251 asymptote seems rather unimportant . our fitting formulae ( [ fit ] ) and ( [ fits ] ) reproduce exactly the high @xmath3 and zero - point limits .",
    "if quantum effects are excluded , our results agree well ( cf .  dots and bars in fig .",
    "[ mu_tot ] ) with monte carlo simulations of @xcite .",
    "the only discrepancy of about 3% occurs at @xmath263 , where anharmonic effects are at their strongest ( and also the error bars of the monte carlo simulation are at their largest ) . if quantum effects are included , then the main difference with the monte carlo results is due to the zero - point contribution to the ion motion term .",
    "compared to the total shear modulus , that also includes the static lattice part , this contribution is important for lighter elements at higher densities , where the ion plasma temperature is not entirely negligible with respect to the typical coulomb ion interaction energy .",
    "we have demonstrated that neither @xmath159 nor @xmath162 have any contributions from subsystems whose partial free energies are functions of particle number density only ; that both coefficients are the same whether they are evaluated at constant temperature or entropy ; we have also proven an identity linking phonon pressure with a coefficient of dynamic matrix expansion in powers of displacement gradients , eq .",
