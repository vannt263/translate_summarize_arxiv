    "the star ls 1135 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 = -@xmath9 07 09 \" ) , a member of the ob association bochum 7 ( vela ob 3 ) , was discovered by corti et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter cnm ) to be a single - lined binary ( sb1 ) system with an orbital period of 2.7532 days .",
    "the spectrum was classified as o6.5v ( ( f ) ) .",
    "the rather high amplitude of the radial velocity variations and the lack of detected spectral lines of the secondary component led cnm to suggest that the secondary might be an early b type star .",
    "magnitudes and colors for ls  1135 from photoelectric photometry have been published by moffat & vogt ( 1975 ) as @xmath10 , and by drilling ( 1991 ) as @xmath11 .",
    "ls  1135 was found to be a photometrically variable star in the `` all sky automated survey '' ( asas ) ( cf . pojmaski 2003 ) .",
    "it is catalogued as an eclipsing system , and a period of 2.7532 days was found independently in the photometric data , in perfect agreement with the period obtained from the radial velocities by cnm . the fact that ls  1135 is an eclipsing binary , motivated us to search for signatures of the secondary component by reinspecting the spectra used by cnm .",
    "here we report the discovery of the spectral lines of the secondary , and calculate for the first time a double  lined radial velocity orbit and a set of values of the main physical parameters of the components of ls  1135 .",
    "these are based on a simultaneous analysis of the photometric light curve and radial velocity variations of both components by means of the wilson - devinney ( w  d ) code ( wilson & devinney 1971 , wilson 1990 , wilson & van hamme 2004 ) .",
    "asas ( cf . pojmaski 2002 )",
    "has been monitoring photometrically a large part of the sky down to stellar magnitude @xmath12 .",
    "the asas instrument was upgraded in late 2000 , being then called asas-3 ( pojmaski , 2001 ) .",
    "the current configuration obtains images with a wide - field ( 8@xmath138 x 8@xmath138 ) ccd camera , using a standard @xmath14 filter .",
    "the scale ( @xmath15 ) of the system results in sub - sampled images , which are suitable to be analyzed through aperture photometry .",
    "figure  [ dss1 ] shows a 4 x 4 region of the sky around ls  1135 .",
    "ls  1135 , catalogued as asas 084350 - 4607.2 , is classified as an eclipsing binary of type esd / ed ( semi - detached / detached ) in the asas-3 catalog of variable stars , available in the internet ( cf .",
    "asas web site ) .",
    "we have retrieved from the asas-3 database the @xmath14 photometric data of ls  1135 observed between 2000 , november , and 2005 , july .",
    "the light curve is shown in figure  [ asasvlc ] .",
    "the data in this figure correspond to @xmath14 values measured with the 3 pixel (= 46\".5 ) aperture .",
    "we selected 313 data values corresponding to this aperture because they show the light curve with the lowest dispersion of data points , and avoid the introduction of third light due to the star located 27  to the s - w of ls 1135 ( see fig .",
    "[ dss1 ] ) .",
    "we note that there are several much fainter stars included in the photometric aperture . taking into account that according to the `` the tycho-2 catalogue of the 2.5 million brightest stars '' ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) , the magnitude difference between ls 1135 and the neighbour at 27  to the s - w is @xmath16 2.3 magnitudes , the other stars included in the aperture appear to be more than 5 magnitudes fainter than ls 1135 .",
    "thus their contribution to the total light would be less than 1% , which has been ignored in our analysis .",
    "the zero point calibration used by asas photometry is based on the hipparcos photometry ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "photographic and digital spectra in the blue spectral region , as previously described by cnm , were used in our study of ls 1135 .",
    "we have re  examined those spectra observed near the quadratures of the orbital motion in a search for spectral signatures of the secondary component .",
    "we found that some of the hei absorption lines appear double near the maximum radial velocity separation of the components .",
    "we could measure the radial velocities from these lines due to the secondary component in ten spectra .",
    "the values of these radial velocities were obtained fitting gaussians to the spectral lines within the iraf routine _ splot _",
    ", and are tabulated in table  [ trv ] according the heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) of observations .",
    "the instrumental configuration is given in column 3 , following the notation from table 1 in cnm .",
    "typical errors in the determination of the radial velocities of the faint lines of the secondary component are rather large , @xmath1640  km  @xmath17 .",

    "as a first step to estimate values of the physical parameters of the components of the binary system ls  1135 , we determined a double  lined radial velocity orbit for the binary .",
    "for this we adjusted circular orbits to the complete set of radial velocities i.e. those published by cnm for the primary , and the values listed in table  [ trv ] for the secondary . because the radial velocities of the secondary component have considerably larger errors , they were assigned lower weight . for the determination of the orbital elements we used an improved version of the code originally published by bertiau & grobben ( 1969 ) .",
    "eccentricity was fixed to 0.0 since both minima in the light curve appear symmetrically separated .",
    "we also calculated an orbital solution leaving the eccentricity as a free parameter .",
    "this solution gave a very small value of the eccentricity , comparable with the error of the circular orbit .",
    "we have therefore adopted @xmath19 for further analysis in this paper .",
    "the initial value for the period was set to 2.7532 days from the previously published single  lined radial velocity orbit .",
    "the value obtained for the double  lined radial velocity orbit resulted in almost the same value , namely 2.753205 @xmath20 days .",
    "the values of the orbital parameters are presented in table  [ tbert ] .",
    "these values are to be considered as preliminary estimates , awaiting more accurate radial velocities for the secondary component from high resolution spectra with higher signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "we used the phoebe package tool ( pra & zwitter , 2005 ) for the light curve ( lc ) and differential corrections ( dc ) fits .",
    "asas photometric data and radial velocities of both components of the binary system were used to adjust the model .",
    "the code was set in mode 2 for detached binaries with no constraints on the potentials ( except for the luminosity of the secondary component ) .",
    "the simplest considerations were applied for the emission parameters of the stars in the model , i.e. stars were considered as black bodies , approximate reflection model ( mref=1 ) was adopted , and no third light or spots were included .",
    "gravity darkening exponents @xmath30 and bolometric albedos @xmath31 were set for radiative envelopes .",
    "we used the square root limb darkening law .",
    "bolometric and @xmath14 band limb darkening coefficients were taken from van hamme ( 1993 ) .",
    "we adopted the mass ratio @xmath32 from our radial velocity orbit .",
    "the temperature for the primary component was set to the corresponding value from the spectral type-@xmath5 calibration tables published by martins et al .",
    "@xmath33 was fixed in this value and @xmath34 was computed with the model fit .",
    "we considered that the system has a circular orbit and that both components rotate syncronously ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the radial velocity of the centre of mass of the binary system was fixed in the value obtained from the radial velocity orbit .",
    "photometric data were weighted from the original magnitude errors provided by the asas database taking the weight as @xmath36 , in such a way that the observations with the lowest magnitude error had @xmath37 .",
    "we then generated synthetic light and radial velocity curves by means of the @xmath38 program of the w - d code , and adjusted them to the observations . in order to get a better delineated light curve",
    ", we proceeded to calculate normal points of the asas photometric data taking 0.02 phase bins .",
    "a weighted average of the magnitudes was computed for every bin , using the individual errors provided by asas database .",
    "a typical @xmath39 is present in each mean point for the aperture considered in this paper .",
    "the results of our best fitting model are depicted in figures  [ cl ] and [ vr ] together with the normal points of the asas light curve of ls  1135 , and the observed radial velocities of both components , respectively .",

    "this epoch does not correspond to a time of minimum light .",
    "we obtained the time corresponding to the principal eclipse with the w - d model as an output of the dc program . in this way",
    "both photometric and radial velocity data contribute to this result .",
    "the epoch was selected being approximate to the time provided by asas .",
    "the ephemeris for the main minimum of the ls  1135 binary system then results as follows :    @xmath54",
    "we have obtained in this work a first approximation to estimate the absolute physical parameters of the ls  1135 o - type binary system . from a simultaneous analysis of the radial velocities and the light curve with the w ",
    "d code , we find the following :    * fixing the @xmath5 of the primary component to the value corresponding to its spectral type , namely o6.5v , from the best fitting w  d model we find @xmath5 @xmath55 for the secondary component .",
    "this value corresponds approximately to a spectral type b1v , according to the scales of different authors ( b@xmath56hm - vitense , 1981 ; schmidt - kaler , 1982 ; crowther , 1997 ) . *",
    "the inclination of the orbital plane of the system relative to the sky plane was found to be @xmath57 according the best fitting w  d model . with this value of @xmath29",
    ", we have obtained values for the individual masses of the primary and secondary components @xmath58 and @xmath59 and for the mean radii @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "both components appear to be well inside their respective roche lobes , and therefore ls  1135 is a detached binary still on the main sequence .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries with accurate elements at the high mass end of the main sequence are exceedingly few in number , and are very much needed as the benchmarks of theoretical stellar models .",
    "thus ls  1135 appears as an excellent candidate for an accurate determination of physical parameters in a high mass binary system . within the uncertainties , the first values of physical parameters of the binary components of ls  1135 which we have determined are in fair agreement with recent tabulations of galactic o star parameters based on models of stellar atmospheres ( cf .",
    "martins et al . 2005 ) . of course , for more accurate values a better defined light curve is needed , as well as spectra with higher signal - to - noise ratio for a more accurate determination of the radial velocities of the secondary component . *",
    "it is also interesting to mention that the mass ratio which we have obtained from the radial velocities @xmath62 , if confirmed , would be among the lowest values recorded for o type main sequence binaries .",
    "therefore , the physical parameters of the primary o6.5v type component would be better defined in this case , since the perturbations introduced by the secondary component on the spectral behaviour of the primary would be minor as compared to binary systems with similar components .",
