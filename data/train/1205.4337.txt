    "in last few years , inclusive neutrino scattering from nuclear targets has become a hot topic .",
    "interest has been spurred by the anomaly observed in recent neutrino quasi - elastic scattering data on @xmath2c  @xcite , i.e.  the excess , at relatively low energy , of measured cross section relative to theoretical calculations .",
    "analyses based on these calculations have led to speculations that our present understanding of the nuclear response to charge - changing weak probes may be incomplete  @xcite , and , in particular , that the momentum transfer dependence of the axial form factor of the nucleon , specifically the cutoff value of its dipole parameterization  @xcite , may be quite different from that obtained from analyses of pion electro - production data  @xcite and measurements of the reaction @xmath3 in the deuteron at quasi - elastic kinematics  @xcite and of @xmath4 and @xmath5 elastic scattering  @xcite ( @xmath6 gev versus @xmath7 gev ) .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the calculations on which these analyses are based use rather crude models of nuclear structure  fermi gas or local density approximations of the nuclear matter spectral function  as well as simplistic treatments of the reaction mechanism , and should therefore be viewed with skepticism .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate cross sections for inclusive neutrino scattering off deuteron in a wide energy range , from threshold up to 1 gev .",
    "the motivations for undertaking such a work are twofold .",
    "the first is to provide a benchmark for studies of electro - weak inclusive response in light nuclei we intend to carry out in the near future .",
    "the second motivation has to do with plans  @xcite , still under development , to determine the neutrino flux in accelerator - based experiments from measurements of inclusive cross sections on the deuteron .",
    "in particular , in charged - current neutrino capture on deuteron , the final states @xmath8 can be measured , in principle , very well . clearly , accurate predictions for these cross sections are crucial for a reliable determination of the flux .",
    "a number of studies of neutrino - deuteron scattering at low and intermediate energies ( @xmath9 mev ) were carried out in the past decades , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of work done up to the mid 1990 s .",
    "these efforts culminated in the nakamura _",
    "s 2001 and 2002 calculations of the cross sections for neutrino disintegration of the deuteron induced by neutral and charge - changing weak currents .",
    "these calculations were based on bound- and scattering - state wave functions obtained from last - generation realistic potentials , and used a realistic model for the nuclear weak current , including one- and two - body terms .",
    "the vector part of this current was shown to provide an excellent description of the @xmath10 radiative capture cross section for neutron energies up to 100 mev  @xcite , while the axial part was constrained to reproduce the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath11-decay  @xcite .",
    "the nakamura _",
    "_ studies have played an important role in the analysis and interpretation of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) experiments  @xcite , which have established solar neutrino oscillations and the validity of the standard model for the generation of energy and neutrinos in the sun  @xcite .    in the present work",

    "@xcite , but include refinements in the modeling of the weak current  which however , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , will turn out to have a minor impact on the predicted cross sections  and extend the range of neutrino energies up to 1 gev .",
    "while the theoretical approach is essentially the same , nevertheless the way in which the calculations are carried out in practice is rather different from that used in those earlier papers , which relied on a multipole expansion of the weak transition operators , and evaluated the cross section by summing over a relatively large number of final two - nucleon channels states .",
    "in contrast , we evaluate , by direct numerical integrations , the matrix elements of the weak current between the deuteron and the two - nucleon scattering states labeled by the relative momentum @xmath12 ( and in given pair spin and isospin channels ) , thus avoiding cumbersome multipole expansions .",
    "differential cross sections are then obtained by integrating over @xmath12 ( and summing over the discrete quantum numbers ) appropriate combinations of these matrix elements , i.e.  by calculating the weak response functions . the techniques developed here for the deuteron should prove valuable",
    "when we will attempt the green s function monte carlo calculation of these response functions ( or rather , their laplace transforms  @xcite ) in @xmath13 nuclei .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : xsect ] and appendix  [ app : app1 ] we present the neutrino and antineutrino differential cross sections expressed in terms of response functions , while in sec .",

    "in this work , we have studied inclusive neutrino scattering on the deuteron up to neutrino energies of 1 gev , by using a realistic description of two - nucleon interactions and weak currents .",
    "two - body terms in the latter increase the calculated cross sections with one - body currents by less than 10% over the whole energy region for both the nc- and cc - induced processes .",
    "interaction effects in the two - nucleon continuum final state are found to be negligible for neutrino energies @xmath1 mev .",
    "this suggests that fairly realistic estimates for these cross sections in light nuclei ( and at relatively high neutrino energies ) may be obtained in calculations based on the plane - wave impulse approximation .",

    "experimentally they produce distinctive final states and give important contributions to total neutrino cross sections above pion - production threshold",
    ". it would be interesting to include these channels in future",
    ".    it should be possible to use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods  @xcite to study neutrino response functions , and associated sum rules , in light nuclei within the same ( realistic ) dynamical framework adopted here . indeed , `` exact '' calculations of this type  @xcite led to a quantitatively accurate description of the quasi - elastic electromagnetic response functions measured in @xmath227 and 4 nuclei .",
    "in particular , they showed that the charge - exchange character of the nucleon - nucleon interaction leads to shifts of longitudinal and transverse strength at higher excitation energies , thus providing a quenching of the response in the quasi - elastic peak region .",
    "this mechanism , however , is more than offset in the transverse channel by two - body currents , in particular those associated with pion exchange , and hence the response is enhanced over the entire quasi - elastic spectrum . it will be interesting to see the extent to which these considerations will remain valid in the weak sector probed in neutrino scattering , and possibly provide an explanation for the observed anomaly in the @xmath2c data .",
