    "there are several theoretical works suggesting that phase separation is a characteristic of the hubbard model , and therefore an intrinsic property of the cuo@xmath5 planes.@xcite moreover , it has been suggested that the phase separation , possibly in the form of strips , can explain many of the unusual properties of the cuprates and leads to the superconductivity ( for example , ref .",

    "nmr study in ybco@xmath7 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 showed no phase separation at all.@xcite direct detection of charge inhomogeneity in ybco@xmath7 is nearly impossible since stm measurements are very difficult due to oxygen loss in vacuum , and surface problems .",

    "this ybco compound has narrow nqr resonance lines , which allows us to distinguish between different in - plane copper [ cu(2 ) ] and associate each line with a local environment .",
    "we then apply two additional nqr based methods called nutation spectroscopy and angle dependent nqr ( adnqr ) .",
    "the two methods are set to measure the quadrupole interaction asymmetry parameter @xmath0 and the tilt angle @xmath1 of the nqr main principle axis @xmath22 from the crystal axis @xmath23 .",

    "( [ malpha ] ) gives @xmath168 .",
    "this is the main finding of this work .",
    "we used nutation spectroscopy and adnqr to measure the quadrupole interaction asymmetry parameter @xmath0 and tilting angle @xmath1 of the main component of the efg principal axis @xmath169 from the crystallographic @xmath170 direction .",
    "calculations show that nutation spectroscopy powder patterns for oriented powder are very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 , but they are not very sensitive to @xmath1 for @xmath1 up to @xmath171 . in contrast , the adnqr line shape is sensitive to both @xmath10 and @xmath1 . in other words , adnqr is sensitive to any breaking of the axial symmetry . however , it is difficult to determine both @xmath1 and @xmath0 from adnqr alone",
    ". the combination of the two methods can give a very good estimate on both parameters .",
    "we implement these techniques on the in - plane cu atom of the ybco compound with different doping levels .",
    "we conclude that for both ybco@xmath144 and ybco@xmath159 , @xmath0 is approximately zero for all cu(2 ) resonance frequencies .",
    "however , the adnqr showed that for the underdoped sample there is a clear difference between the cu(2 ) neighboring a cu(1 ) in a full chain as in a fully doped sample [ cu(1)@xmath14 ] and the cu(2 ) neighboring a cu(1 ) in an empty or a half filled chain [ cu(1)@xmath5-cu(1)@xmath16 ] .",
    "this difference can result from a small change in the efg principal axis @xmath28 with respect to the lattice directions @xmath23 .",
    "the motivation for these experiments was to measure possible charge inhomogeneity or electronic phase separation in the ybco compound .",
    "both the nutation spectroscopy and the adnqr for the cu(2 ) from a fully oxygenized local environment cu(1)@xmath14 , even for lower averaged doping , show a homogeneous charge distribution in the plane .",
    "our combined experiments also imply that only for cu(2 ) neighboring a cu chain with missing oxygen cu(1)@xmath174 or cu(1)@xmath16 is the principle axis @xmath28 of the efg tensor not along @xmath23 , namely , @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , only from the point of view of a cu(2 ) in ybco@xmath175 neighboring a cu(1)@xmath5 or cu(1)@xmath16 , are the @xmath176 and @xmath80 crystallographic directions less identical than in ybco@xmath177 this means that any charge inhomogeneity in the plane is correlated directly with the o dopant atoms , and therefore can not be an intrinsic property of the cuo@xmath178 planes alone .",

    "our result for the ybco compound reinforces the surface experiments done on bi-2212 .",
