    "it has been shown in the paper that two weighting methods , based on rather different principles and approaches , are in fact equivalent not only for complete pairwise comparison matrices , as lundy , siraj and greco @xcite recently proved , but also for incomplete ones .",
    "the geometric mean of weight vectors calculated from all spanning trees has been proved to be logarithmic least squares optimal .",
    "the advantages rooted in the definition of the two methods , namely the clear interpretation of taking all spanning trees into account , and the optimality by a well understood objective function ( lls ) , have now been united .",
    "the only difference is in computational complexity .",
    "the logarithmic least squares problem can be solved from a single system of linear equations ( the coefficient matrix is the laplacian ) , while the list of all spanning trees can be exponentially long .",
    "an important consequence of the paper is that future analyses of weighting methods should not distinguish between the incomplete lls and the geometric mean of weight vectors from all spanning trees .",
