    "<S> a monte carlo simulation of the @xmath0 @xmath1 theory in the broken phase is performed on a hypercubic lattice in search of an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the region of the cutoff theory where the interaction is strong as it is there that a resonance would be expected to have a better chance to form . in that region </S>",
    "<S> the presence of an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance with mass below the cutoff is excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> y epsf    \\1 . </S>",
    "<S> truein    1.5 truein    the simplest effective theory describing low energy pion nucleon interactions is described by a chiral langrangian , and involves the three pion fields @xmath4 , the scalar field @xmath5 , the two nucleons , their interactions , and the dimensionful pion decay constant @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 , although it has never really been seen , may exist in nature as a broad and quite heavy ( @xmath7 ) isospin i=0 , spin j=0 resonance . in that setting </S>",
    "<S> , it was natural to ask whether the presence of the @xmath8 resonance was a consequence of the pion interactions or of some more fundamental interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> since the earliest such theory ( gell  mann levy sigma model  ) becomes an o(4 ) @xmath1 theory if the nucleon fields are neglected , this question reduces to whether or not the o(4 ) @xmath1 theory can sustain an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance in the broken phase .    today , in a very different setting </S>",
    "<S> , this same question is of interest again . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar sector of the minimal standard model is also a four component @xmath1 theory in the broken symmetry phase . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent of the @xmath5 resonance is the higgs particle , the three pions are the goldstone bosons , the pion decay constant is the weak scale @xmath9 , and the scattering of longitudinally polarized vector bosons behaves exactly the same way as a scaled up version of @xmath10@xmath10 scattering ( equivalence theorem  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the higgs , like the @xmath5 , is quite heavy and broad and may avoid detection at ssc . on the other hand , if the four component @xmath1 theory does indeed contain an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance , then since the @xmath8 resonance , as it appears in nature , is quite strong , its equivalent in the scalar sector of the minimal standard model may have a good chance to be detected at ssc . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it becomes very important to know if another `` signature '' of the scalar sector , besides the higgs resonance , is awaiting discovery at ssc .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier attempts   to answer this question used analytical approximations such as pade approximants and found that an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance is present in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear , however , whether or not the presence of this resonance is an artifact of the approximations used and therefore the question of the existence of an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance in the theory has yet to receive a conclusive answer .    </S>",
    "<S> we report here on a monte carlo simulation to shed new light on this old question  . </S>",
    "<S> the o(4 ) @xmath1 theory has the lattice action @xmath11 and was simulated on the lattice in the @xmath12 limit . in that limit , </S>",
    "<S> the theory has the strongest interactions and a resonance probably has a better chance to form .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulation was done on a hypercubic lattice @xmath13 of spatial extension @xmath14 and time extension @xmath15 using an incomplete heat bath algorithm   on the cm-2 machine at scri . since , on a finite lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the symmetry breaking changes from configuration to configuration , the same approach as in  @xcite was used to disentangle the massive scalar field @xmath5 from the goldstone modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass @xmath16 of the @xmath5 field was measured using standard techniques . to measure the energy of the lowest laying state in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 channel , an operator carrying these quantum numbers needs to be constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest such operator is : @xmath17 where summation over repeated indices is assumed , @xmath18 are the isospin indices , @xmath19 is the totally antisymmetric tensor , @xmath20 is the @xmath21th euclidean unit vector of the time slice @xmath22 , and @xmath23 $ ] is the z - component spin index . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the time slice connected correlation function of this operator gives a very weak signal . to get a better signal </S>",
    "<S> an operator that extends over several lattice spacings needs to be constructed using a trial wave function for the two  pion state . </S>",
    "<S> the `` bag '' and `` bound state '' meson wave functions were considered  . </S>",
    "<S> the latter gave a better signal with an affordable cost in computer time and was therefore used for the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> using as a trial wave function for the two pions at relative position @xmath24 , the hydrogen wave function @xmath25 , an @xmath2 , @xmath3 operator with total 3-momentum zero was constructed : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a three - dimensional cubic box centered at the origin and contained in @xmath22 , @xmath28 is the `` bohr radius '' in lattice units , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the azimuthal and polar angles of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the @xmath33 spherical harmonic ( up to a multiplicative normalization constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath28 can be given any value . </S>",
    "<S> a very large @xmath28 will cause the exponential to decrease very slowly and then the sum over @xmath24 will have to be carried out over a box @xmath27 as large as @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> since this can increase the computer time significantly , a smaller @xmath28 has to be used so that the size of the box that contains the important contribution from the exponential can be made smaller . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath28 can not be made very small because the signal becomes weaker as @xmath28 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> an optimal choice of @xmath28 and @xmath27 was found to be @xmath34 , and @xmath27 extending from @xmath35 to @xmath36 in each of the three directions . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath37 couples to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 states . the energy of the lowest laying state in this channel can be found by looking at the time slice connected correlation function @xmath38 of this operator .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulation was done on an @xmath39 and @xmath40 lattice and for three values of the hopping parameter @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> these values were chosen so that a wide range of @xmath16 will be covered ( they also coincide with some of the values used in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation values of @xmath42 , were measured .    </S>",
    "<S> .energy @xmath43 in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 channel . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath44 was fitted for a few different ranges of @xmath45 , and the resulting energies @xmath43 , together with the @xmath46 per degree of freedom for each fit are given in table 1 for the @xmath47 and @xmath48 lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective energy @xmath49 , for the two time slices at t-1 and \u0010t , is plotted versus t for the three values of @xmath50 in figures 1 ( @xmath47 ) and 2 ( @xmath48 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of t omitted from those plots had an @xmath49 with very large error .    </S>",
    "<S> in a two - pion @xmath2 , @xmath3 state with zero total 3momentum , the lowest 3momentum a pion can have has one component equal to @xmath51 and two equal to @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the next one has two components equal to @xmath51 and one equal to @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 channel is therefore expected to contain levels with energies close to the energies of these states , but slightly different because of the interaction . for the @xmath47 lattice , </S>",
    "<S> these levels have energies @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , and are denoted by the dotted lines y    =    in figure 1 . from this figure , it is clear that the observed energy levels are very close to the levels of two free pions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for smaller @xmath45 , the levels are close to @xmath55 , and for larger @xmath45 they are close to @xmath56 . because the free two  pion levels are not very well separated at @xmath47 , the observed levels are probably a mixture of the two lowest ones . in that sense , the energies in table 1 for the @xmath47 lattice are probably a mixture as well . the fact that the observed levels correspond to a two  pion state and not to a resonance is also greatly supported by the fact that these levels change only slightly from @xmath57 to @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> after all , in that range @xmath16 varies from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . therefore , if a resonance is present it must have energy larger than @xmath61 and is either too heavy ( for example , heavier than @xmath62 ) to be observed with this method , y    =    or is `` hiding '' between @xmath63 and @xmath62 . that the latter is not the case </S>",
    "<S> can be seen by looking at the energy levels obtained for the @xmath48 lattice . from figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that there are no energy levels below @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since the two lowest free two  pion states are well separated in this lattice , the lowest energy level is clearly visible in this figure . </S>",
    "<S> it is true that the limited statistics give @xmath49 only up to @xmath65 , but because the lowest level is well separated from the next one , the correlated @xmath46 fit gives a good estimate of the energy of this level . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers given in table 1 are indeed very close to the lowest free two  pion energy @xmath66 and do not seem to change much for the different values of @xmath50 .    from this analysis it is evident that if an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance exists for @xmath67 , it is unphysical since it must have energy larger than the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> of course there is always the possibility that a resonance with energy below the cutoff does exist , but , because the overlap of the operator in eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 with an @xmath69 , @xmath3 resonance may have been much smaller than its overlap with the free two pion states present in that channel , it was not possible to observe with the statistics and lattices used . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is unlikely that this is the case since the operator in eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 is more appropriate for a resonance than for a free two particle state .    </S>",
    "<S> for the theory of gell - mann and levy of low energy pion processes the @xmath67 region corresponds to the region where the @xmath5 particle mass is greater than approximately @xmath70 ( or equivalently the cutoff is less than approximately @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> ( or @xmath72 ) is made through the renormalized coupling constant @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath74 for this value of @xmath50 was taken from  . ] since @xmath16 is expected to be much larger than @xmath70 , it is clear from the results that the existence of the @xmath8 resonance in nature can not be accounted for by this low energy theory alone ( in contrast to  ) .    for the scalar sector of the minimal standard model </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath75 region corresponds to where the higgs mass is greater than approximately @xmath76 ( or equivalently the cutoff is less than approximately @xmath77 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs mass is of course not known but its upper bound is placed at around @xmath78 ( hypercubic lattice triviality bound ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the existence of an @xmath2 , @xmath3 resonance can be excluded with confidence for values of the higgs mass above @xmath79 . for @xmath80 ( higgs mass @xmath81 ) </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the interaction becomes weaker and hence it is safe to say that if a resonance could not form for @xmath67 , where the interaction is stronger , it is unlikely that it will in this region either . </S>",
    "<S> for this reson it was not deemed necessary to investigate the @xmath80 region . a numerical simulation for @xmath80 not only is not necessary , but it would also be very costly since larger lattices will have to be used ( the correlation length becomes larger than approximately @xmath82 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it must be emphasized that these conclusions are valid only within the realm of the scalar sector of the minimal standard model . </S>",
    "<S> it is of course still possible that the physics that enters at higher energies may be able to produce such a resonance in very much the same way the physical @xmath8 particle owes its existence to qcd . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance if it exists due to some higher energy theory it would have energy determined by that theory . in fact , it is possible that the energy of this resonance is determining the cutoff energy of the minimal standard model .    </S>"
