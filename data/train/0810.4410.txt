    "within the last few years , the properties of massless and massive `` relativistic '' particles have been probed in magneto - optical experiments carried out on several carbon - based systems : graphene monolayer@xcite and bilayer,@xcite multi - layer epitaxial graphene,@xcite as well as bulk graphite.@xcite these experiments offer an important insight into the electronic structure of these materials , in particular , they directly demonstrate the unusual @xmath0-scaling of landau levels ( lls ) of dirac fermions . naturally , these experiments stimulated intensive theoretical work in this area.@xcite    recently , remarkable experiments have been performed on the same systems without applied magnetic field .",
    "a universal value of optical conductivity was demonstrated in graphene@xcite as well as in bulk graphite.@xcite the optical response of graphene monolayer and bilayer samples as a function of the gate voltage was reported in several experimental works , see refs .  , and this topic was addressed also theoretically.@xcite first results of time - resolved optical experiments on multi - layer graphene are also available.@xcite    in this paper , we present a direct comparison of the magneto - transmission spectra taken on a thin layer of bulk graphite and multi - layer epitaxial graphene .",
    "we focus on spectral features exhibiting a @xmath0-dependence , which corresponds to the optical response of dirac fermions , and show that there are essential differences in the spectra of both materials .",
    "the investigated multi - layer graphene sample was prepared by thermal decomposition on the carbon face of a 4h - sic substrate@xcite and contains around @xmath1100 graphene layers .",
    "the thin layer of bulk graphite was prepared by simple exfoliation as described in ref .  .",
    "as no significant difference in fir optical response of natural graphite and hopg was found,@xcite we present only results taken on natural graphite due to its higher crystalline quality .",
    "both samples were characterized using micro - raman . in the case of multi - layer",
    "epitaxial graphene , the raman signature of decoupled layers , equivalent to a single flake of exfoliated graphene,@xcite as well as of additional graphite residuals were found , see ref .  .",
    "the raman spectra taken on a thin graphite layer dominantly showed a multi - component 2d band typical of many bernal - stacked sheets , but some minor traces of decoupled layers were found , see the discussion in ref .  .",
    "to measure the fir transmittance of the sample , the radiation of globar , delivered via light - pipe optics to the sample and detected by a si bolometer placed directly below the sample , was analyzed by a fourier transform spectrometer .",
    "all measurements were performed in the faraday configuration with the magnetic field applied normal to graphene / graphite layers .",
    "all the spectra were taken with non - polarized light in the spectral range of 5 - 350  mev , limited further by several regions of low tape transmissivity or the sic opacity , see grey areas in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "a comparison of the transmission spectra taken on multi - layer epitaxial graphene and a thin layer of bulk graphite is presented in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] . starting with results taken on multi - layer layer graphene in fig .",
    "[ comparison]a , a series of absorption lines is observed and denoted by roman letters , following the notation introduced in ref .  .",
    "assuming the ll spectrum of graphene , @xmath2 , together with the corresponding selection rules for dipole - allowed transitions @xmath3 , the observed absorption lines b , c , d , e and f can be clearly identified as inter - ll transitions l@xmath4l@xmath5 and l@xmath6l@xmath7 with @xmath8 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the fermi velocity is found to be @xmath9  m.s@xmath10 .",
    "hence , these results are fully consistent with a model of 2d dirac fermions and individual sheets in multi - layer epitaxial graphene indeed behave as if they are electronically decoupled .",
    "this was recently explained by a random mutual rotation of adjacent sheets in this material.@xcite similar spectra were also measured on a single sheet of exfoliated graphene,@xcite however , the fermi velocity seems to be enhanced by amount of  @xmath1110% and these data also suggest some influence of electron - electron interaction , not observed in transmission spectra of multi - layer epitaxial graphene .",
    "the results obtained on a thin layer of bulk graphite , see fig .",
    "1b , are more complex .",
    "basically , all the absorption lines observed in multi - layer graphene are also found in spectra of bulk graphite with practically the same fermi velocity @xmath12  m.s@xmath10 .",
    "this justifies the same notation using the roman letters .",
    "in addition to these lines , another series of transitions , denoted by greek letters and clearly exhibiting the @xmath0-dependence , is present in transmission spectra .",
    "these lines can not be assigned to any dipole - allowed transitions between lls in graphene . nevertheless , the energies of the additional lines @xmath13 and @xmath14 exactly match to transitions symmetric around the dirac point , l@xmath4l@xmath15 , with indices @xmath16 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath17 line can be identified as transitions l@xmath18l@xmath19 .    to explain the absorption lines denoted by the greek letters we have to abandon the simplified model of 2d dirac fermions and consider the full band structure of bulk graphite . according to the standard swm model,@xcite dirac fermions",
    "are located in the vicinity of the @xmath20 point , where the bands @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the doubly degenerate @xmath23 are close to the fermi level . if the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath24-axis of the crystal , landau levels or more accurately , landau bands are created , see fig .",
    "[ asymmetry ] , having at the @xmath20 point ( @xmath25 ) an analytical form@xcite ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the pseudogap , i.e. the distance of @xmath21 ( and also @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 bands at @xmath25 and @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is related to the fermi velocity as @xmath31 .",
    "the form of lls   implies several important @xmath20 point - related optical properties of graphite .",
    "it suggests that the ll energy spectrum typical of graphene is present also at the @xmath20 point in graphite , when the pseudogap @xmath32 is small in comparison to the energies of the lls .",
    "experimentally , @xmath32 is found to be significantly below 10  mev , see refs .  , and therefore , the magnetic fields above 100  mt are sufficient to insure this condition . on the other hand , each ll in eq .   is ( with the exception of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) doubly degenerate , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "[ asymmetry ] .",
    "this double degeneracy is in addition to the spin and valley degeneracies present in graphene . obviously ,",
    "taking account of the same selection rules @xmath3 , we obtain a considerably richer set of possible dipole - allowed transitions for graphite in comparison to graphene .",
    "for instance , the transition l@xmath37l@xmath38 is strictly forbidden in graphene , nevertheless the absorption line at this energy ( @xmath39 transition ) is observed in bulk graphite at the @xmath20 point due to the dipole - allowed transitions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "[ asymmetry]b .",
    "similarly , the lines @xmath42 and @xmath14 are detected due to transitions @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 and 3 , respectively . the remaining @xmath17 line can be identified as @xmath46 and @xmath47 . hence , the presence of absorption lines denoted by greek letters is qualitatively consistent with the standard swm model of graphite",
    ". nevertheless , we are aware of inconsistency of our results with predictions of koshino and ando.@xcite they expect that for graphite layer with several tens or more bernal - stacked sheets , the intensities of @xmath0-dependent absorption lines should be negligible in comparison with spectral features arising in massive electrons around the @xmath48 point , which evolve nearly linearly with @xmath49 .",
    "another difference of spectra figs .",
    "[ comparison]a and b is an apparent asymmetry of the b line in bulk graphite at low magnetic fields , whereas the equivalent line in the spectra of multi - layer graphene remains perfectly symmetric . to explain this difference",
    ", we must extend our considerations to the near vicinity of the @xmath20 point and take into account the @xmath50-dependence of lls .",
    "such ll structure calculated within the standard swm model is shown in fig .",
    "[ asymmetry]a , where the two components , b@xmath51 and b@xmath52 of which the b line consists , are denoted by arrows .",
    "note that the relatively low value of the pseudogap @xmath32 does not allow to directly resolve the splitting of the b line into these components . at low magnetic field ,",
    "when the landau band @xmath53 is nearly parallel with @xmath54 and/or when it is partially or completely located above the fermi level , we can expect rather asymmetrical shape of the b line with a well - pronounced high energy tail due to the transition @xmath55 . with increasing magnetic field , this asymmetry should gradually disappear , as indeed observed experimentally , see  fig .  [ comparison]b . from the lineshape",
    ", we roughly estimate the position of the fermi level slightly below @xmath11 - 20  mev , but the situation is here complicated by the fact that also decoupled graphene layers in graphite , revealed by the raman spectroscopy or detected in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments,@xcite can contribute to the final shape of the b line .",
    "note , that for the sample of multi - layer graphene investigated here , the fully symmetrical b line survives in transmission spectrum down to magnetic fields of 40  mt , when the fermi level is located at @xmath117  mev from the dirac point.@xcite the presented transmission experiment thus probes mainly undoped graphene sheets ( @xmath56  @xmath57 ) , which are located further from the sic substrate .",
    "the layer(s ) in the immediate vicinity of the substrate are highly conductive ( above @xmath58  @xmath57 ) and can be probed in transport experiments.@xcite    analogous considerations based on the shapes of landau bands in the vicinity of the h point , can also qualitatively explain the significant differences in widths of individual absorption lines . for instance , the c line is roughly three times broader in comparison to the @xmath39 line , see fig .",
    "[ comparison]b , in spite of the fact that they both originate in the same lls . for a simple explanation of this fact",
    ", we just need to realize that the @xmath39 line is composed of transitions @xmath59 and @xmath41 .",
    "if we take account of the near vicinity of @xmath60 , we find out that both pairs of these lls are nearly parallel , see fig .",
    "[ asymmetry]b , and give thus a rather sharp @xmath39 line in comparison to the c line .",
    "this line is composed of transitions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "[ asymmetry]c , which occur between pairs of lls having their derivatives of opposite signs , which causes the broadening of the c line .",
    "this explanation can be straightforwardly generalized for all transitions , giving qualitative explanation of the differences in linewidths simply using the standard swm model .    in principle , another and even more appealing interpretation of our data could assume that we actually see the response of decoupled graphene layers instead of the @xmath20 point of bulk graphite",
    ". the presence of additional `` greek '' lines in spectra could be then a consequence of some perturbation of the graphene system leading to a relaxation of the selection rules @xmath3 . even though the appearance of some decoupled graphene sheets in our sample",
    "is very likely , we have the following arguments to support our `` bulk '' interpretation : i ) our experiments@xcite were performed on several samples prepared from two different types of bulk graphite and the almost identical results , concerning the presence , position , lineshape and mainly mutual intensities of all the @xmath0-scaled absorption lines were obtained .",
    "ii ) the `` greek '' transitions show significantly smaller linewidth in comparison to `` roman '' ones , e.g. compare lines @xmath39 and c , which is unlikely to be caused by any perturbation relaxing the selection rules in graphene .    in both materials , spectral features evolving nearly linearly with @xmath49",
    "are also observed , see low energy part of spectra in figs .",
    "[ comparison]a and b , and represent thus an evidence for massive particles . in bulk graphite , can we relate these transitions to the @xmath48 point , i.e. to massive electrons , as discussed already in ref .  .",
    "the optical response of massive electrons in the magnetic field was thoroughly analyzed e.g. in refs .  .",
    "in case of multi - layer graphene , the spectral features linear in @xmath49 can not be explained unless some part of the sample is created from bulk graphite or at least from few - layer graphene stacks .",
    "indeed , the traces of bernal - stacked layers were found in micro - raman experiment , as mentioned above .",
    "we have compared the optical response of dirac fermions in bulk graphite and multi - layer epitaxial graphene in low magnetic fields .",
    "whereas the results obtained on multi - layer graphene fully correspond to expectations for dipole - allowed transitions in a 2d gas of dirac particles , the transmission spectra taken on bulk graphite appear to be more complex .",
    "the standard slonczewski - weiss - mcclure model is found , in the latter case to be sufficient to explain the existence of all absorption lines scaling as @xmath0 as well as their individual lineshapes ."
