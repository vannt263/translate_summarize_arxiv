    "the studies of strongly correlated electrons in transition metal oxides ( tmos ) focus traditionally on @xmath0 materials @xcite , mainly because of high - temperature superconductivity discovered in cuprates and more recently in iron - pnictides , and because of colossal magnetoresistance manganites .",
    "the competition of different and complex types of order is ubiquitous in strongly correlated tmos mainly due to coupled spin - charge - orbital where frustrated exchange competes with the kinetic energy of charge carriers .",
    "the best known example is spin - charge competition in cuprates , where spin , charge and superconducting orders intertwine @xcite and stripe order emerges in the normal phase as a compromise between the magnetic and kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "remarkable evolution of the stripe order under increasing doping is observed @xcite and could be reproduced by the theory based on the extended hubbard model @xcite .",
    "hole doping in cuprates corresponds to the removal of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "similarly , hole doping in a simplest system with the orbital order in @xmath8 configuration removes locally orbital degrees of freedom and generates stripe phases which involve orbital polarons @xcite .",
    "it was predicted recently that orbital domain walls in bilayer manganites should be partially charged as a result of competition between orbital - induced strain and coulomb repulsion @xcite , which opens a new route towards charge - orbital physics in tmos .",
    "we will show below that the stripe - like order may also occur in doped spin - orbital systems .",
    "these systems are very challenging and their doping leads to very complex and yet unexplored spin - orbital - charge phenomena @xcite .",
    "a prerequisite to the phenomena with spin - orbital - charge coupled degrees of freedom is the understanding of undoped systems @xcite , where the low - energy physics and spin - orbital order are dictated by effective spin - orbital superexchange @xcite and compete with spin - orbital quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "although ordered states occur in many cases , the most intriguing are quantum phases such as spin @xcite or orbital @xcite liquids .",
    "recent experiments on a copper oxide ba@xmath9cusb@xmath10o@xmath11 @xcite have triggered renewed efforts in a fundamental search for a quantum spin - orbital liquid @xcite , where spin - orbital order is absent and electron spins are randomly choosing orbitals which they occupy . a signature of strong quantum effects in a spin - orbital system is a disordered state which persists down to very low temperatures .",
    "a good example of such a disordered spin - orbital liquid state is as well fesc@xmath10s@xmath12 which does not order in spite of finite curie - weiss temperature @xmath13 k @xcite , but shows instead signatures of quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "spin - orbital interactions may be even more challenging  for instance previous attempts to find a spin - orbital liquid in the kugel - khomskii model @xcite or in linio@xmath10 @xcite turned out to be unsuccessful .",
    "in fact , in the former case certain types of exotic spin order arise as a consequence of frustrated and entangled spin - orbital interactions @xcite , and a spin - orbital entangled resonating valence bond state was recently shown to be a quantum superposition of strped spin - singlet covering on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "in contrast , spin and orbital superexchange have different energy scales and orbital interactions in linio@xmath10 are much stronger and dominated by frustration @xcite . hence the reasons behind the absence of magnetic long range order are more subtle @xcite . in all these cases orbital fluctuations play a prominent role and spin - orbital entanglement @xcite determines the ground state .",
    "the role of charge carriers in spin - orbital systems is under very active investigation at present . in doped la@xmath14(sr ,",
    "ca)@xmath15mno@xmath9 manganites several different types of magnetic order compete with one another and occur at increasing hole doping @xcite .",
    "undoped lamno@xmath9 is an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator , with large @xmath16 spins for @xmath17 ionic configurations of mn@xmath18 ions stabilized by hund s exchange , coupled via the spin - orbital superexchange due to @xmath19 and @xmath7 electron excitations @xcite .",
    "the orbital @xmath19 degree of freedom is removed by hole doping when mn@xmath18 ions are generated , and this requires careful modeling in the theory that takes into account both @xmath17 and @xmath2 electronic configurations of mn@xmath18 and mn@xmath20 ions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the orbital order changes radically with increasing doping in la@xmath14(sr , ca)@xmath15mno@xmath9 systems at the magnetic phase transitions between different types of magnetic order @xcite , as weel as at la@xmath21ca@xmath22mno@xmath9/bifeo@xmath9 heterostructures , where it offers a new route to enhancing multiferroic functionality @xcite . the double exchange mechanism @xcite triggers ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic phase at sufficient doping ; in this phase the spin and orbital degrees of freedom decouple and spin excitations are explained by the orbital liquid @xcite .",
    "due to distinct magnetic and kinetic energy scales , even low doping may suffice for a drastic change in the magnetic order , as observed in electron - doped manganites @xcite .    a rather unique example of a spin - orbital system with strongly fluctuating orbitals , as predicted in the theory @xcite and seen experimentally @xcite , are the perovskite vanadates with competing spin - orbital order @xcite . in these @xmath7 systems @xmath23 orbitals are filled by one electron and orbital order of active @xmath24 orbitals is strongly influenced by doping with ca ( sr ) ions which replace y ( la ) ones in yvo@xmath9 ( lavo@xmath9 ) . in this case",
    "finite spin - orbit coupling modifies the spin - orbital phase diagram @xcite .",
    "in addition , the af order switches easily from the @xmath25-type af ( @xmath25-af ) to @xmath26-type af ( @xmath26-af ) order in the presence of charge defects in y@xmath14ca@xmath15vo@xmath9 .",
    "already at low @xmath27 doping the spin - orbital order changes and spectral weight is generated within the mott - hubbard gap @xcite .",
    "although one might imagine that the orbital degree of freedom is thereby removed , a closer inspection shows that this is not the case as the orbitals are polarized by charge defects @xcite and readjust near them @xcite .",
    "removing the orbital degree of freedom in vanadates would be only possible by electron doping generating instead @xmath28 ionic configurations , but such a doping by charge defects would be very different from the doping by transition metal ions of the same valence considered below .    also in @xmath1 materials spin - orbital physics plays a role @xcite , as for instance in ca@xmath29sr@xmath15ruo@xmath12 systems with ru@xmath20 ions in @xmath4 configuration @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that unconventional magnetism is possible for ru@xmath20 and similar ions where spin - orbit coupling plaus a role @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , these systems are not similar to manganites but to vanadates where one finds as well ions with active @xmath7 orbitals . in the case of ruthenates",
    "the @xmath30 ru@xmath20 ions have low @xmath31 spin as the splitting between the @xmath7 and @xmath19 levels is large .",
    "thus the undoped ca@xmath10ruo@xmath12 is a hole analogue of a vanadate @xcite , with @xmath7 orbital degree of freedom and @xmath31 spin per site in both cases .",
    "this gives new opportunities to investigate spin - orbital entangled states in @xmath7 system , observed recently by angle resolved photoemission @xcite .",
    "here we focus on a novel and very different doping from all those considered above , namely on a _ substitutional _ doping by other magnetic ions in a plane built by transition metal and oxygen ions , for instance in the @xmath32 plane of a monolayer or in perovskite ruthenates or vanadates . in this study",
    "we are interested primarily in doping of a tmo with @xmath7 orbital degrees of freedom , where doped magnetic ions have no orbital degree of freedom and realize _",
    "orbital dilution_. in addition , we deal with the simpler case of @xmath0 doped ions where we can neglect spin - orbit interaction which should not be ignored for @xmath1 ions .",
    "we emphasize that in contrast to manganites where holes within @xmath19 orbitals participate in transport and are responsible for the colossal magnetoresitance , such doped hole are immobile due to the ionic potential at @xmath0 sites and form defects in spin - orbital order of a mott insulator .",
    "we encounter here a different situation from the dilution effects in the 2d @xmath19 orbital system considered so far @xcite as we deel with magnetic ions at doped sites .",
    "it is challenging to investigate how such impurities modify locally or globally spin - orbital order of the host .",
    "the doping which realizes this paradigm is by either mn@xmath20 or cr@xmath18 ions with large @xmath33 spins stabilized by hund s exchange , and orbital dilution occurs either in a tmo with @xmath34 ionic configuration as in the vanadium perovskites , or in @xmath1 mott insulators as in ruthenates .",
    "it has been shown that dilute cr doping for ru reduces the temperature of the orthorhombic distortion and induces fm behavior in ca@xmath10ru@xmath14cr@xmath15o@xmath12 ( with @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "it also induces surprising negative volume thermal expansion via spin - orbital order .",
    "such defects , on one hand , can weaken the spin - orbital coupling in the host , but on the other hand , may open a new channel of interaction between the spin and orbital degree of freedom through the host - impurity exchange , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bond_schem ] .",
    "consequences of such doping are yet unexplored and are expected to open a new route in the research on strongly correlated oxides .",
    "ion with no orbital degree of freedom and spin @xmath33 substitutes @xmath4 one with spin @xmath31 on a bond having specific spin and orbital character in the host ( gray arrows ) .",
    "spins are shown by red arrows and doubly occupied @xmath7 orbitals ( doublons ) are shown by green symbols for @xmath36 and @xmath37 orbitals , respectively .",
    "( b ) if an inactive orbital along the bond is removed by doping , the total spin exchange is af .",
    "( c ) on the contrary , active orbitals at the host site can lead to either fm ( top ) or af ( bottom ) exchange coupling , depending on the energy levels mismatch and difference in the coulomb couplings between the impurity and the host .",
    "we show the case when the host site is unchanged in the doping process .",
    "[ fig : bond_schem ] ]    the physical example for the present theory are the insulating phases of @xmath5 hybrid structures , where doping happens at @xmath38 transition metal sites , and the value of the spin is locally changed from @xmath31 to @xmath33 . as a demonstration of the highly nontrivial physics emerging in @xmath5 oxides , remarkable effects have already been observed , for instance , when ru ions are replaced by mn , ti , cr or other @xmath0 elements .",
    "the role of mn doping in the srruo ruddlesden - popper series is strongly linked to the dimensionality through the number @xmath39 of ruo@xmath10 layers in the unit cell .",
    "the mn doping of the srruo@xmath9 cubic member drives the system from the itinerant fm state to an insulating af configuration in a continuous way via a possible unconventional quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "doping by mn ions in sr@xmath40ru@xmath10o@xmath41 leads to a metal - to - insulator transition and af long - range order for more than @xmath42 mn concentration @xcite .",
    "subtle orbital rearrangement can occur at the mn site , as for instance the inversion of the crystal field in the @xmath19 sector observed via x - ray absorption spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering studies indicate the occurrence of an unusual @xmath43-type antiferromagnetism in doped systems ( planar order with fm zigzag chains with af order between them ) with moments aligned along the @xmath37 axis within a single bilayer  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the more extended @xmath1 orbitals would _ a priori _ suggest a weaker correlation than in @xmath0 tmos due to a reduced ratio between the intraatomic coulomb interaction and the electron bandwidth . nevertheless , the ( effective ) @xmath44-bandwidth is reduced by the changes in the @xmath0-@xmath45-@xmath0 bond angles in distorted structures which typically arise in these materials .",
    "this brings these systems on the verge of a metal - insulator transition @xcite , or even into the mott insulating state with spin - orbital order , see fig .",
    "[ fig : host ] .",
    "hence , not only @xmath1 materials share common features with @xmath0 systems , but are also richer due to their sensitivity to the lattice structure and to relativistic effects due to larger spin - orbit @xcite or other magneto - crystalline couplings .",
    "-af spin order coexisting with @xmath25-ao orbital order in the @xmath32 plane of an undoped mott insulator with @xmath4 ionic configurations .",
    "spins are shown by arrows while doubly occupied @xmath23 and @xmath46 orbitals ( @xmath37 and @xmath36 doublons , see text ) form a checkerboard pattern .",
    "equivalent spin - orbital order is realized for v@xmath18 ions in @xmath47 planes of lavo@xmath9 @xcite , with orbitals standing for empty orbitals ( holes ) . ]    to simplify the analysis we assume that onsite coulomb interactions are so strong that charge degrees of freedom are projected out , and only virtual charge transfer can occur between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ions via the oxygen ligands . for convenience ,",
    "we define the orbital degree of freedom as a _ doublon _ ( double occupancy ) in the @xmath30 configuration .",
    "the above @xmath0 doping leads then effectively to the removal of a doublon in one of @xmath7 orbitals which we label as @xmath48 ( this notation is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and explained below ) and to replacing it by a @xmath49 ion . to our knowledge , this is the only example of removing the orbital degree of freedom in @xmath7 manifold realized so far and below we investigate possible consequences of this phenomenon .",
    "another possibility of orbital dilution which awaits experimental realization would occur when a @xmath7 degree of freedom is removed by replacing a @xmath34 ion by a @xmath28 one , as for instance by cr@xmath18 doping in a vanadate  here a doublon is an empty @xmath7 orbital , i.e. , filled by two holes .    before presenting the details of the quantitative analysis ,",
    "let us concentrate of the main idea of the superexchange modified by doping in a spin - orbital system .",
    "the @xmath28 ions have singly occupied all three @xmath7 orbitals and @xmath33 spins due to hund s exchange .",
    "while a pair of @xmath28 ions , e.g. in srmno@xmath9 , is coupled by af superexchange @xcite , the superexchange for the @xmath50 bond has a rather rich structure and may also be fm .",
    "the spin exchange depends then on whether the orbital degree of freedom is active and participates in charge excitations along a considered bond or electrons of the doublon can not move along this bond due to the symmetry of @xmath7 orbital , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond_schem ] .",
    "this qualitative difference to systems without active orbital degrees of freedom is investigated in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the main outcomes of our analysis are : ( i ) the determination of the effective spin - orbital exchange hamiltonian describing the low - energy sector for the @xmath5 hybrid structure , ( ii ) establishing that a @xmath2 impurity without an orbital degree of freedom modifies the orbital order in the @xmath4 host , ( iii ) providing the detailed way how the microscopic spin - orbital order within the @xmath4 host is modified around the @xmath2 impurity , and ( iv ) suggesting possible spin - orbital patterns that arise due to periodic and finite substitution ( doping ) of @xmath1 atoms in the host by @xmath0 ones .",
    "the emerging physical scenario is that the @xmath0 impurity acts as an orbital vacancy when the host - impurity coupling is weak and as an orbital polarizer of the bonds active @xmath7 doublon configurations when it is strongly coupled to the host .",
    "the tendency to polarize the host orbitals around the impurity turns out to be robust and independent of spin configuration . otherwise , it is the resulting orbital arrangement around the impurity and the strength of hund s coupling at the impurity that set the character of the host - impurity magnetic exchange .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the effective model describing the spin - orbital superexchange at the @xmath5 bonds which serves to investigate the changes of spin and orbital order around individual impurities and at finite doping .",
    "we arrive at a rather general formulation which emphasizes the impurity orbital degree of freedom , being a doublon , and present some technical details of the derivation in appendix a. the strategy we adopt is to analyze first the ground state properties of a single @xmath2 impurity surrounded by @xmath4 atoms by investigating how the spin - orbital pattern in the host may be modified at the nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites to the @xmath0 atom .",
    "this study is performed for different spin - orbital patterns of the @xmath1 host with special emphasis on the alternating fm chains ( @xmath26-af order ) which coexist with @xmath25-type alternating orbital ( @xmath25-ao ) order , see fig .",

    "we address the impurity problem within the classical approximation in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfa ] . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , there are two nonequivalent cases which depend on the precise modification of the orbital order by the @xmath0 impurity , doped either to replace a doublon in @xmath36 orbital ( sec .",

    "starting from the single impurity solution we next address periodic arrangements of @xmath0 atoms at different concentrations .",
    "we demonstrate that the spin - orbital order in the host can be radically changed by the presence of impurities , leading to striped patterns with alternating fm / af domains and islands of fully fm states . in sec .",

    "in this section we consider a @xmath0 impurity in a strongly correlated @xmath1 tmo and derive the effective @xmath54 spin - orbital superexchange .",
    "it follows from the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals via oxygen @xmath45 orbitals due to the @xmath55 hybridization . in a strongly correlated system",
    "it suffices to concentrate on a pair of atoms forming a bond @xmath56 , as the effective interactions are generated by charge excitations @xmath57 along a single bond @xcite . in the reference @xmath1 host",
    "both atoms on the bond @xmath56 are equivalent and one considers , @xmath58 the coulomb interaction @xmath59 is local at site @xmath60 and we describe it by the degenerate hubbard model @xcite , see below .",
    "we implement a strict rule that the hopping within the @xmath7 sector is allowed in a tmo only between two neighboring orbitals of the same symmetry which are active along the bond direction @xcite , and neglect the interorbital processes originating from the octahedral distortions such as rotation or tilting .",
    "indeed , in ideal undistorted ( perovskite or square lattice ) geometry the orbital flavor is conserved as long as the spin - orbit coupling may be neglected .",
    "the interorbital hopping elements are smaller by at least one order of magnitude and may be treated as corrections in cases where distortions play a role to the overall scenario established below .",
    "the kinetic energy for a representative @xmath0-@xmath45-@xmath1 bond , i.e. , after projecting out the oxygen degrees of freedom , is given by the hopping in the host @xmath61 between sites @xmath60 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 here @xmath64 are the electron creation operators at site @xmath60 in the spin - orbital state @xmath65 .",

    "only two out of three @xmath7 orbitals are active along each bond @xmath67 and contribute to @xmath68 , while the third orbital lies in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath69 axis and thus the hopping via oxygen is forbidden by symmetry .",
    "this motivates a convenient notation as follows @xcite , @xmath70 with the @xmath7 orbital inactive along a given direction @xmath71 labeled by the index @xmath69 .",
    "we consider a 2d square lattice with transition metal ions connected via oxygen orbitals as in a ruo@xmath10 @xmath32 plane of ca@xmath10ruo@xmath12 ( srruo@xmath9 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) orbitals are active along the @xmath74 ( @xmath36 ) axis , while @xmath75 orbitals are active along both @xmath76 axes .    to derive the superexchange in a mott insulator , it is sufficient to consider a bond which connects nearest neighbor sites , @xmath77 .",
    "below we consider a bond between an impurity site @xmath78 occupied by a @xmath0 ion and a neighboring host @xmath1 ion at site @xmath79 .",

    "the remaining terms contribute to the multiplet structure and are of importance for the correct derivation of the superexchange which follows from charge excitations , see below .",
    "finally , we include a local potential on the @xmath1 atom which encodes the energy mismatch between the host and the impurity orbitals close to the fermi level and prevents valence fluctuations on the @xmath1 ion due to the @xmath0 doping .",
    "this term has the following general structure , @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the low energy processes is derived from @xmath94 ( [ hub ] ) by a second order expansion for charge excitations generated by @xmath81 , and treating the remaining part of @xmath94 as an unperturbed hamiltonian .",

    "a direct consequence is that the parity constraint together with the unbalance between the spin at the host and the impurity sites leads to a nonvanishing total projection of the spin and angular momentum with respect to a symmetry axis , e.g. the @xmath245 axis .",
    "it is worth to note that a fixed parity for the impurity spin means that it prefers to point in one direction rather than the other one which is not the case for the host s spin and angular momentum .",

    "[ fig : diag](a ) is preserved at this value of spin - orbit coupling , however firstly , the transitions between the phases are smooth and secondly , the subtle differences between the two qfs@xmath36 , qaf@xmath36 and qaf@xmath37 phases are no longer present .",
    "this also refers to the smaller value of @xmath236 , i.e. , @xmath278 , but already for @xmath280 the out - of - plane moments are so strongly suppressed ( except for the impurity moment in the qfs@xmath221 phase ) and the orbital polarization is so weak ( i.e. , almost spherical ellipsoids ) that typically the only distinction between the phases can be made by looking at the in - plane spin correlations and the average spin - orbit , @xmath297 . in this limit",
    "we conclude that the phase diagram is ( partially ) melted by large spin - orbit coupling but for lower values of @xmath236 it is still valid .",
    "we have derived the spin - orbital superexchange model for @xmath2 impurities replacing @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) ions in the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) host in the regime of mott insulating phase .",
    "although the impurity has no orbital degree of freedom , we have shown that it contributes to the spin - orbital physics and influences strongly the orbital order .",
    "in fact , it tends to project out the inactive orbitals at the impurity - host bonds to maximize the energy gain from virtual charge fluctuations . in this case",
    "the interaction along the superexchange bond can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic , depending on the ratio of hund s exchange coupling at impurity ( @xmath302 ) and host ( @xmath303 ) ions and on the mismatch @xmath125 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 atomic energies , modified by the difference in hubbard @xmath304 s and hund s exchange @xmath305 s at both atoms .",
    "this ratio , denoted @xmath133 ( [ eq : etai ] ) , replaces here the conventional parameter @xmath306 often found in the spin - orbital superexchange models of undoped compounds ( e.g. , in the kugel - khomskii model for kcuf@xmath9 @xcite ) where it quantifies the proximity to ferromagnetism . on the other hand ,",
    "if the overall coupling between the host and impurity is weak in the sense of the total superexchange , @xmath126 , with respect to the host value , @xmath127 , the orbitals being next to the impurity may be forced to stay inactive which modifies the magnetic properties  in such cases the impurity - host bond is always antiferromagnetic .    as we have seen in the case of a single impurity , the above two mechanisms can have a nontrivial effect on the host , especially if the host itself is characterized by frustrated interactions , as it happens in the parameter regime where the @xmath26-af phase is stable .",
    "for this reason we have focused mostly on the latter phase of the host and we have presented the phase diagrams of a single impurity configuration in the case when the impurity is doped on the sublattice where the orbitals form a checkerboard pattern with alternating @xmath37 and @xmath36 orbitals occupied by doublons .",
    "the diagram for the @xmath37-sublattice doping shows that in some sense the impurity is never weak , because even for a very small value of @xmath175 it can release the host s frustration around the impurity site acting as an orbital vacancy . on the other hand , for the @xmath36-sublattice doping when the impurity - host coupling is weak , i.e. , either @xmath175 is weak or @xmath133 is close to @xmath191 , we have identified an interesting quantum mechanism releasing frustration of the impurity spin ( that can not be avoided in the purely classical approach ) .",
    "it turned out that in such situations the orbital flips in the host make the impurity spin polarize in such a way that the @xmath26-af order of the host is completely restored .",
    "the cases of the periodic doping studied in this paper show that the host s order can be completely altered already for _ rather low _ doping of @xmath51 , even if the @xmath175 is small . in this case",
    "we can stabilize a ferrimagnetic type of phase with a four - site unit cell having magnetization @xmath307 , reduced further by quantum fluctuations .",
    "we have established that the only parameter range where the host s order remains unchanged is when @xmath133 is close to @xmath191 and @xmath308 .",
    "the latter value is very surprising as it means that the impurity - host coupling must be large enough to keep the host s order unchanged  this is another manifestation of the orbital vacancy mechanism that we have already observed for a single impurity .",
    "also in this case the impurity spins are fixed with the help of orbital flips in the host that lift the degeneracy which arises in the classical approach .",
    "we would like to point out that the quantum mechanism that lifts the ground state degeneracy mentioned above and the role of quantum fluctuations are of particular interest for the periodically doped checkerboard systems with @xmath309 doping which is a challenging problem for future research .",
    "from the point of view of generic , i.e. , non - periodic doping , the most representative cases are those of a doping which is incommensurate with the two - sublattice spin - orbital pattern . to uncover the generic rules in such cases , we have studied periodic @xmath52 and @xmath53 doping .",
    "one finds that when the period of the impurity positions does not match the period of 2 for both the spin and orbital order of the host , interesting novel types of order emerge .",
    "in such cases the elementary cell must be doubled in both lattice directions which clearly gives a chance of realizing more phases than in the case of commensurate doping .",
    "our results show that indeed , the number of phases increases from 4 to 7 and the host s order is altered in each of them .",
    "quite surprisingly , the overall character of the phase diagram remained unchanged with respect to the one for @xmath51 doping and , if we ignore the differences in configuration , it seems that only some of the phases got divided into two versions differing either by the spin bond s polarizations around impurities ( phases around @xmath191 ) , or by the character of the orbitals around the impurities ( phases with inactive orbitals in the limit of small enough product @xmath310 , versus phases with active orbitals in the opposite limit ) .",
    "orbital polarization in this latter region resembles orbital polarons in doped manganites @xcite  also here such states are stabilized by the double exchange @xcite .",
    "a closer inspection of underlying phases reveals however a very interesting degeneracy of the impurity spins at @xmath52 that arises again from the classical approach but this time it can not be released by short - range orbital flips .",
    "this happens because the host s order is already so strongly altered that it is no longer anisotropic ( as it was the case of the @xmath26-af phase ) and there is no way to restore the orbital anisotropy around the impurities that could lead to spin - bonds imbalance and polarize the spin . in the case of lower @xmath53 doping such an effect",
    "is absent and the impurity spins are always polarized , as it happens for @xmath51 .",
    "it shows that this is rather a peculiarity of the @xmath52 periodic doping .    indeed",
    ", one can easily notice that for @xmath52 every atom of the host is a nearest neighbor of some impurity .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath51 we can find three host s atoms per unit cell which do not neighbor any impurity and for @xmath53 there are sixteen of them .",
    "for this reason the impurity effects are amplified for @xmath52 which is not unexpected although one may find somewhat surprising that the ground state diagrams for the lowest and the highest doping considered here are very similar .",
    "this suggests that the cooperative effects of multiple impurities are indeed not very strong in the low - doping regime , so the diagram obtained for @xmath53 can be regarded as generic for the dilute doping regime with uniform spatial profile .",
    "for the representative case of @xmath51 doping , we have presented the consequences of quantum effects beyond the classical approach .",
    "spin fluctuations are rather weak for the considered case of large @xmath31 and @xmath33 spins , and we have shown that orbital fluctuations on superexchange bonds are more important .",
    "they are strongest in the regime of antiferromagnetic impurity - host coupling ( which suggests importance of entangled states @xcite ) and enhance the tendency towards frustrated impurity spin configurations but do not destroy other generic trends observed when the parameters @xmath133 and @xmath175 increase .",
    "increasing spin - orbit coupling leads to qualitative changes in the spin - orbital order . when hund s exchange is small at the impurity sites , the antiferromagnetic bonds around it have reduced values of spin - orbit coupling term , but the magnetic moments reorient and survive in the @xmath32 planes , with some similarity to the phenomena occurring in the perovskite vanadates @xcite .",
    "this quenches the magnetic moments at @xmath0 impurities and leads to almost uniform orbital occupancies at the host sites .",
    "in contrast , frustration of impurity spins is removed and the impurity magnetization along the @xmath37 axis survives for large spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the _ orbital dilution _ considered here influences directly the orbital degrees of freedom in the host around the impurities .",
    "the synthesis of hybrid compounds having both @xmath0 and @xmath1 transition metal ions will likely open a novel route for unconventional effects in complex materials .",
    "there are several reasons for expecting new scenarios in mixed @xmath5 spin - orbital - lattice materials , and we pointed out only some of them . on the experimental side ,",
    "the changes of local order could be captured using inelastic neutron scattering or resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) .",
    "in fact , using rixs can also bring an additional advantage : rixs , besides being a perfect probe of both spin and orbital excitations , can also ( indirectly ) detect the nature of orbital ground state ( supposedly also including the nature of impurities in the crystal ) @xcite . unfortunately , there are no such experiments yet but we believe that they will be available soon",
    ".    short range order around impurities could be investigated by the excitation spectra at the resonant edges of the substituting atoms .",
    "taking them both at finite energy and momentum can dive insights into the nature of the short range order around the impurity and then unveil information of the order within the host as well . even if there are no elastic superlattice extra peaks one can expect that the spin - orbital correlations will emerge in the integrated rixs spectra providing information of the impurity - host coupling and of the short range order around the impurity .",
    "even more interesting is the case where the substituting atom forms a periodic array with small deviation from the perfect superlattice when one expects the emergence of extra elastic peaks which will clearly indicate the spin - orbital reconstruction . in our case an active orbital diluted site can not participate coherently in the host spin - orbital order but rather may to restructure the host ordering @xcite . at dilute impurity concentration",
    "we may expect broad peaks emerging at finite momenta in the brillouin zone , indicating the formation of coherent islands with short range order around impurities .",
    "we also note that local susceptibility can be suitably measured by making use of resonant spectroscopies ( e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , electron spin resonance ( esr ) , nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) , muon spin resonance ( @xmath311sr ) , _ etcetera _ ) that exploit the different magnetic or electric character of the atomic nuclei for the impurity and the host in the hybrid system .",
    "finally , the random implantation of the muons in the sample can provide information of the relaxation time in different domains with unequal dopant concentration which may be nonuniform .",
    "for the given problem the differences in the resonant response can give relevant information about the distribution of the local fields , the occurrence of local order and provide access to the dynamical response within doped domains .",
    "the use of local spectroscopic resonance methods has been widely demonstrated to be successful when probing the nature and the evolution of the ground state in the presence of spin vacancies both for ordered and disordered magnetic configurations @xcite .    in summary , this study highlights the role of spin defects which lead to orbital dilution in spin - orbital systems .",
    "using an example of @xmath2 impurities in a @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) host we have shown that impurities change radically the spin - orbital order around them , independently of the parameter regime . as a general feature",
    "we have found that doped @xmath2 ions within the host with spin - orbital order have frustrated spins and polarize the orbitals of the host when the impurity - host exchange as well as hund s exchange at the impurity are both sufficiently large .",
    "this remarkable trend is independent of doping and is expected to lead to global changes of spin - orbital order in doped materials . while the latter effect is robust , we argue that the long - range spin fluctuations resulting from the translational invariance of the system will likely prevent the ground state from being macroscopically degenerate , so if the impurity spins in one unit cell happens to choose its polarization then the others will follow . on the contrary , in the regime of weak hund s exchange @xmath2 ions",
    "act not only as spin defects which order antiferromagnetically with respect to their neighbors , but also induce doublons in inactive orbitals .",
    "finally , we remark that this behavior with switching between inactive and active orbitals by an orbitally neutral impurity may lead to multiple interesting phenomena at macroscopic doping when global modifications of the spin - orbital order are expected to occur .",
    "most of the results were obtained in the classical approximation but we have shown that modifications due to spin - orbit coupling do not change the main conclusion .",
    "we note that this generic treatment and the general questions addressed here , such as the release of frustration for competing spin structures due to periodic impurities , are relevant to double perovskites @xcite . while the local orbital polarization should be similar , it is challenging to investigate disordered impurities , both theoretically and in experiment , to find out whether their influence on the global spin - orbital order in the host is equally strong .",

    "<S> we investigate the changes in spin and orbital patterns induced by magnetic transition metal ions without an orbital degree of freedom doped in a strongly correlated insulator with spin - orbital order . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we study the @xmath0 ion substitution in @xmath1 transition metal oxides in the case of @xmath2 doping at either @xmath3 or @xmath4 sites which realizes _ orbital dilution _ in a mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> although we concentrate on this doping case as it is known experimentally and more challenging than other oxides due to finite spin - orbit coupling , the conclusions are more general . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the effective @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) superexchange in a mott insulator with different ionic valencies , underlining the emerging structure of the spin - orbital coupling between the impurity and the host sites and demonstrate that it is qualitatively different from that encountered in the host itself . </S>",
    "<S> this derivation shows that the interaction between the host and the impurity depends in a crucial way on the type of doubly occupied @xmath7 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that in some cases , due to the quench of the orbital degree of freedom at the @xmath0 impurity , the spin and orbital order within the host is drastically modified by doping . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity acts either as a spin defect accompanied by an orbital vacancy in the spin - orbital structure when the host - impurity coupling is weak , or it favors doubly occupied active orbitals ( orbital polarons ) along the @xmath5 bond leading to antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic spin coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this competition between different magnetic couplings leads to quite different ground states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the case of a finite and periodic @xmath0 atom substitution , it leads to striped patterns either with alternating ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic domains or with islands of saturated ferromagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> we find that magnetic frustration and spin degeneracy can be lifted by the quantum orbital flips of the host but they are robust in special regions of the incommensurate phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> orbital quantum fluctuations modify quantitatively spin - orbital order imposed by superexchange . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the spin - orbit coupling can lead to anisotropic spin and orbital patterns along the symmetry directions and cause a radical modification of the order imposed by the spin - orbital superexchange . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are expected to be of importance for future theoretical understanding of experimental results for @xmath1 transition metal oxides doped with @xmath2 ions . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest how the local or global changes of the spin - orbital order induced by such impurities could be detected experimentally . </S>"
