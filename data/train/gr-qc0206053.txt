    "quantization consists in turning functions on the phase space of a given classical system into operators acting on a hilbert space associated with the quantized system . to construct this map",
    ", one selects a set of ` elementary ' observables ( like @xmath1 in quantum mechanics ) which generate all functions on the phase space and form a subalgebra of the classical poisson algebra .",
    "this subalgebra has to be mapped homomorphically into the quantum operator algebra , turning real observables into selfadjoint operators ( i.e. , one is looking for a @xmath2-representation of a suitable subalgebra of the classical poisson algebra on the quantum hilbert space ) .",
    "such a procedure is provided by general quantization schemes ( most relevant for quantum geometry is algebraic quantization @xcite , others are geometric quantization @xcite or group theoretic quantization @xcite ; in this context , see also @xcite for a discussion of allowed representations in the last scheme ) , but the issue of more complicated , composite expressions is left open . in general , composite operators are built up from the elementary ones in a way following the classical expression .",
    "however , at this point quantization ambiguities arise which render a unique quantization impossible .",
    "the most obvious problem is the following one : since the symplectic structure on the classical phase space is non - degenerate , the operator algebra must be non - abelian which leads to factor ordering ambiguities for composite operators .",
    "more generally , the origin of quantization ambiguities is that classical relations need not hold exactly after quantization ( in fact , not all classical relations can be exact at the quantum level ; an exact correspondence is required only for the algebraic and reality conditions mentioned above ) .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite a given classical expression using some classical identity and quantize the original and the rewritten expression ; if the classical identity is violated at the quantum level , the result will be two different operators for the same classical expression .",
    "one can only require that both operators coincide in some ( classical ) limit involving @xmath3 , but in a regime where quantum effects are important they can be quite different from each other .",
    "those ambiguities can be fixed only by comparing with experimental observations or , in the absence of experiments , by internal consistency .",
    "if qualitative predictions involving quantum effects are done , they need to be checked for independence of possible ambiguities .    in many systems ,",
    "quantization ambiguities can be largely ignored since interesting observables are relatively simple .",
    "for instance , a standard hamiltonian in quantum mechanics of the form @xmath4 is free of factor ordering ambiguities .",
    "another example is that of generators of symmetries which have a distinguished representation for the system in question , like the gauss constraint in yang ",
    "mills theories . in canonical quantum gravity",
    "( see @xcite for a recent review ) , however , the situation is different : its dynamics is governed by the hamiltonian constraint which is a complicated expression and does not generate a simple symmetry of functions on the space manifold . for a long time the problem of finding even one well - defined quantization had remained out of reach ; only recently has an operator been given in quantum geometry @xcite . this was made possible by using classical reformulations of some components of the classical constraint which brought the expression into a form suitable for a quantization . as discussed above , those reformulations also open the door for quantization ambiguities and their effects have to be studied carefully .    in quantum geometry ,",
    "basic variables are holonomies along curves in space associated with the ashtekar connection @xmath5 , and the densitized triad @xmath6 . whereas the area of a surface or the volume of a region in space can be written as functionals solely of the densitized triad , and so have fairly unambiguous quantizations @xcite , other geometric operators and",
    "also the hamiltonian constraint contain the co - triad @xmath7 which can not be quantized directly .",
    "instead , the classical identity ( with the gravitational constant @xmath8 , the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xmath9 @xcite , and the volume @xmath10 ) @xmath11 is used @xcite which can be quantized by using the known volume operator , expressing the connection via holonomies , and turning the poisson bracket into a commutator .",
    "it is even possible to turn singular classical expressions containing inverse powers of @xmath12 into well - defined operators because inverse powers of the volume can be absorbed into the volume appearing in the poisson bracket .",
    "this is the mechanism which leads to well - defined , finite matter hamiltonians @xcite and also plays an important role for the absence of cosmological singularities @xcite .    using classical reformulations of this kind gives rise to quantization ambiguities .",
    "classically we have the relation @xmath13 ) of @xmath14 as a poisson bracket , and the right hand side using the basic @xmath15 ( which has been done to derive the standard volume operator @xcite ) resulting in very different operators .",
    "more generally , we can insert @xmath16 which holds for any non - degenerate triad , into an arbitrary classical expression and obtain a different quantization .",
    "( if we want to absorb negative powers of @xmath12 into the poisson brackets to obtain a well - defined operator , the power @xmath17 should be chosen to be positive , but is arbitrary otherwise . )",
    "this is the first type of ambiguity studied in this paper .",
    "there is a second , quite distinct ambiguity which appears in the same expression @xmath18 for @xmath14 . for the quantization of @xmath19",
    "we have a unique choice , but as mentioned the connection components have to be expressed via holonomies since those are basic in quantum geometry . initially ,",
    "only holonomies in the fundamental representation of @xmath0 have been used , but as first exploited in @xcite , one can choose an arbitrary representation as long as one compensates by a constant prefactor ( which just depends on the spin of the representation ) .",
    "this constitutes a second one - parameter family of ambiguities .    in the full theory ,",
    "operators reflecting these ambiguities are difficult to study explicitly since , e.g. , the volume operator which plays a prominent role in this kind of quantization is complicated and its spectrum is not known explicitly .",
    "therefore , here we study those ambiguities within isotropic quantum geometry @xcite , where the complete volume spectrum has been derived explicitly @xcite . in this context",
    "we can compute all relevant operators and their spectra and decide whether or not there are internal constraints on the ambiguities .",
    "one result which has implications for the full theory is that the spin chosen for the representation of holonomies can not be too high if almost classical behavior at reasonably large volumes is to be preserved .",
    "the considerations are also of interest within cosmological models : for a singularity - free evolution @xcite it is necessary that operators for the inverse scale factor @xcite or inverse volume annihilate the state @xmath20 which corresponds to the classical singularity .",
    "since this state is also annihilated by the volume operator , a simultaneous annihilation by the inverse volume can not correspond to classical behavior and so could be expected to be sensitive to quantization ambiguities . in particular , the eigenvalue in @xmath20 must be zero , not just finite as expected if the curvature divergence is regularized in the quantum theory .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the eigenvalue is in fact zero for the particular quantization discussed there , and the following general explanation has been presented .",
    "the procedure sketched above leads to expressions where @xmath21 appears within a poisson bracket .",
    "since a poisson bracket acts as a derivative on its two arguments , there will always be factors of @xmath22 ( which only matter if one looks at the behavior at the classical singularity ) .",
    "if the rest of the expression is expected to have a finite quantization in @xmath20 , it will be pushed to zero by the sign factor .",
    "( there is no general proof , however , since the classical expression involves the undefined quantity `` @xmath23 '' ) .",
    "still , since this result is crucial for a singularity - free evolution , it has to be checked against possible quantization ambiguities .",
    "the quantization of the inverse scale factor and related operators makes use of the reformulation of @xmath14 and so we can use the ambiguities , discussed above , to shed some light on this issue .",
    "it turns out that all operators in the families of ambiguities studied here annihilate the state @xmath20 , and so the predictions of loop quantum cosmology concerning the fate of the classical singularity are robust .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the following section we recall the basic formulas of isotropic loop quantum cosmology , mainly the action of operators which will be used later . using this framework ,",
    "a quantization of the inverse volume will be introduced in section [ amtriad ] which realizes the first quantization ambiguity , followed in section [ amhol ] by a quantization of the inverse square root of the scale factor realizing the second ambiguity .",
    "the choice of these particular powers of the scale factor is just to obtain simple quantizations which can be studied easily . for other expressions",
    "the same steps can be repeated and we can also combine both families of ambiguities in one operator . finally , consequences regarding the full theory and quantum cosmology are discussed in section  [ concl ] .",
    "to find symmetric states one needs to know the general form of connections and triads invariant under the given action of the symmetry group on space @xcite . in the case of homogeneity @xcite , invariant connections and triads have the form @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dual one - forms and vector fields on space which are left - invariant under the symmetry group . for homogeneity , the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 are arbitrary constants , but for isotropic models they must have the form @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an internal @xmath0-triad which is rotated under gauge transformations , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the only gauge invariant parameters with the symplectic structure @xmath35 ( using the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xmath9 ) .",
    "the isotropic triad component @xmath34 can be any real number ; its sign determines the orientation of the triad .",
    "it is related to the scale factor @xmath36 , which appears as the isotropic co - triad component @xmath37 , through @xmath38 ( note that we also have a sign in @xmath36 due to the two possible orientations ) .    in the connection representation ,",
    "gauge invariant isotropic states are represented as function of the single parameter @xmath33 ; an orthonormal basis is given by @xcite @xmath39 basic multiplication operators are given by the three holonomies @xmath40 which are all gauge rotations of each other .",
    "the action of operators containing these holonomies can always be computed using the basic relations @xmath41 for geometrical operators we also need the volume operator whose action is @xcite @xmath42 it will appear mainly in the form of a commutator with a holonomy : @xmath43 & = & \\hat{v}-\\cos({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c ) \\hat{v }   \\cos({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c)- \\sin({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c ) \\hat{v } \\sin({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c)\\\\   & & - 2\\lambda_i^i\\tau_i \\left(\\sin({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c ) \\hat{v } \\cos({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c)-   \\cos({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c ) \\hat{v } \\sin({{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}c)\\right)\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term of this sum has the action @xmath44 which directly shows its eigenvalues .",
    "an example for an operator containing these expressions is the inverse scale factor operator of @xcite .",
    "one starts by writing @xmath45 in terms of isotropic co - triad components and uses the identity ( [ cotriad ] ) for @xmath46 .",
    "the quantization then proceeds by using the volume operator , writing the connection components in terms of holonomies and turning the poisson bracket into a commutator .",
    "important for the finiteness of the resulting operator is that the determinant of @xmath46 , by which we have to divide in the classical expression , can be absorbed into the volume appearing in the poisson bracket .",
    "thus , the inverse scale factor has a well - defined quantization even though the volume operator has eigenvalue zero .",
    "this procedure is a common technique in quantum geometry @xcite , which uses ( [ cotriad ] ) as an essential ingredient . since it applies to a large number of interesting quantities which are not simple functions of the basic operators , it is not surprising that one has to reformulate the original classical expression , and quantization ambiguities are to be expected .",
    "we start with the first kind of ambiguities mentioned in the introduction , namely the one resulting from a possible violation of the classical relation @xmath47 at the quantum level . for illustrative purposes we discuss an operator",
    "whose absolute value on non - degenerate states is a quantization of the inverse volume @xmath48 .",
    "the volume operator ( [ vol ] ) has eigenvalue zero , and so its inverse does not exist as a densely defined operator .",
    "however , as in @xcite we can use the techniques developed in @xcite to quantize the inverse volume ; in fact this has already been done for matter hamiltonians in @xcite where the first step is to replace @xmath49 by @xmath50 . here",
    "( [ triadrel ] ) has been used , and this reformulation allows to apply ( [ cotriad ] ) and a subsequent quantization to a well - defined operator .",
    "we are going to follow the same procedure in the reduced model of isotropic quantum geometry , but allowing arbitrary powers as in ( [ ambig1 ] ) .",
    "this leads us to @xmath51 where we used the relation @xmath52 for the homogeneous co - triad which is the analog of ( [ cotriad ] ) ( see @xcite for a derivation which takes care of the sign of @xmath53 ) . in the next step we absorb the volume in the denominator into the @xmath19 appearing in the poisson brackets and write the contraction of the coefficients @xmath28 in the @xmath0-indices as a trace over a product of @xmath54 : @xmath55 note that we distributed the volume in the denominator symmetrically over the three poisson brackets ; choosing a different way gives rise to another ambiguity which is briefly discussed below .",

    "quantum geometry provides a natural procedure @xcite to quantize classically divergent quantities like the inverse volume resulting in bounded operators : writing co - triad components as poisson brackets between holonomies and the volume allows one to absorb inverse powers of the volume . since the poisson bracket acts as a derivative on @xmath175 with respect to triad components , there will always be a factor of the sign of @xmath176 which is defined to be zero for degenerate triads ( the sign appears explicitly in our definitions of @xmath81 and @xmath177 in ( [ rkdef ] ) , ( [ sjdef ] ) ) .",

    "note that the presence of the sign is a direct consequence of the techniques which lead to well - defined operators ; it has no effect in the classical limit since the classical description requires non - degenerate triads .",
    "whereas in the first family of ambiguities ( section [ amtriad ] ) the suppression of the classical divergence was located at only a few states close to the classical singularity ( fig .  [ vinv ] ) , in the second family it took place in a large range ( section [ amhol ] ) depending on the parameter @xmath109 ( fig .  [ ainv ] ) .",
    "an immediate consequence is that @xmath109 can not be arbitrarily large if we want to have classical behavior at observable scales .",
    "while this still leaves a large freedom in the possible values , it severely limits the applicability of one conclusion of @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the idea was to _ use _ the ambiguity to find a hamiltonian obeying a ` crossing symmetry ' @xcite , but it was shown that this is not possible for any finite value of @xmath109 . the only open possibility is to take an infinite linear combination of hamiltonian constraint operators with different @xmath109 , reaching arbitrarily large values .",
    "the results of the present paper imply that this would spoil the classical limit of the theory unless the coefficients in the series which defines the constraint drop off very fast for large @xmath109 . while it is true that any term for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath109 in the series has the correct classical limit at large volume , i.e.  if @xmath178 , unfortunately we have to perform the @xmath179 limit first if we define the constraint as an infinite series , and we can never fulfill the condition @xmath178 .    choosing large values for the parameters of the quantization ambiguities can lead to observable effects . to see this , we take the operators for inverse powers of the isotropic volume as models for more complicated expressions in the full theory ( most notably , matter hamiltonians which all involve the quantization techniques employed here ) . instead of the total volume in our formulas , we would have the relevant scale of the physical process under investigation .",
    "( another aspect which is not considered here is that semiclassical states should be used which are peaked in both the connection and the triad ; see @xcite for proposals .",
    "here we are working with eigenstates of the triad which give an unsharp connection , but we can interpret the present results as lower bounds for corrections since states which do not have sharp values for the triad would have an additional uncertainty which can only increase correction terms . ) correction terms to classical behavior are obtained by expanding expectation values in a parameter which is given by the planck length divided by the relevant length scale .",
    "qualitative calculations for quantum gravity corrections in matter hamiltonians have been done in @xcite where the coefficients in an expansion have been assumed to be of order one ( see also @xcite for a proposed derivation from the full theory which goes beyond a purely phenomenological analysis ) .",
    "if this is the case , one can hope to find observational evidence for deviations from the classical structure of space - time only if the corrections are of first order in the planck length .",
    "however , if one does not introduce parity violating terms into the semiclassical states used for the calculation @xcite , the corrections start at second or fourth order @xcite , depending on the assumed properties of semiclassical states , the latter of which coincides with our formulas ( [ rkexpand ] ) and ( [ sjnexpand ] ) ( one can see that the high order of those corrections is related to the conservation of parity : @xmath180 in ( [ rkn ] ) and @xmath159 in ( [ sjn ] ) are either even or odd in @xmath83 and so their absolute values are parity invariant ; this implies that expansions of these formulas in @xmath181 can only contain even powers , which translates to corrections at least of the order @xmath182 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of the present paper demonstrate that the magnitude of coefficients in the correction terms can depend significantly on quantization ambiguities .",
    "therefore , before one can make precise predictions one must find a way to fix the ambiguities . as the expansions ( [ rkexpand ] ) and ( [ sjnexpand ] ) show , the fundamental scale for correction terms is effectively given by @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively , rather than just by @xmath185 .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is fixed by computations of black hole entropy @xcite and smaller than one , so the only free parameters are the ambiguity parameters @xmath17 and @xmath109 ( in the families considered here ) .",
    "choosing large values for these parameters will lift the effective fundamental scale and thereby increase correction terms .",
    "note that this mechanism does not affect the planck scale which still controls the discreteness of space . but",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath109 control the set - in of deviations from classical behavior , and by choosing large values we can have corrections to classical behavior at arbitrary scales even in regions where the discreteness of space is insignificant .",
    "however , one has to expect additional constraints on the parameters since large values also modify the formulas at small scales : in the @xmath17-family , large values of the parameter blow up curvatures at small @xmath83 ( recall that @xmath186 increases exponentially in @xmath17 ) , whereas the @xmath109-family leads to a behavior ( [ sjnsmall ] ) for @xmath83 smaller than @xmath109 , which is very different from the inverse square root of the scale factor which is approached at large volume .",
    "it may be surprising that a quantization ambiguity in quantum gravity can have observable effects at ordinary scales rather than just at the planck scale .",
    "however , the classical limit @xmath3 always includes a large volume limit @xmath187 because the relation @xmath188 would imply zero volume otherwise @xcite .",
    "therefore , exact classical behavior can only be expected in this limit in which we have @xmath178 for any fixed @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , at observable scales the classical limit would not have been performed completely and so quantum effects there are less surprising .",
    "so far , we have only discussed kinematical aspects .",
    "since quantizations of the hamiltonian constraint @xcite also contain the characteristic commutator , they have the same ambiguities .",
    "ambiguities in the commutator itself affect the coefficients in the constraint equation in a way as discussed previously .",
    "but the constraint also contains additional holonomies which quantize components of the curvature of @xmath5 and do not appear in the form of commutators with the volume operator .",
    "this part of the constraint generates the structure of the discrete time evolution equation as a difference equation @xcite , whereas the commutator only affects the coefficients appearing in the equation . for the holonomy",
    "part we only have the second ambiguity by choosing higher representations , which we studied in section [ amhol ] . if we use a representation ( [ hmatrix ] ) with spin @xmath109 for all holonomies , each one will contribute factors @xmath189 with @xmath17 between @xmath190 and @xmath109 acting as multiplication operators .",
    "in flat models , we have four holonomies , so the highest power occuring in a multiplication operator is @xmath191 which maps a state @xmath116 as in ( [ n ] ) to @xmath192 . after transforming to the triad representation @xcite",
    ", this leads to a difference equation of order @xmath193 ( reaching from @xmath194 to @xmath195 ; this is only the counting for the euclidean part , the order in the lorentzian constraint will be twice as large ) .",
    "thus , choosing a large @xmath109 implies a large number of independent solutions .",
    "even though most of them ( @xmath196 ) are non - pre - classical ( i.e.  changing significantly at the planck scale , see @xcite ) and have to be excluded for a semiclassical analysis , a small number of those solutions seems preferable which would allow only small values for @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , a better understanding of the status of non - pre - classical solutions could reduce the freedom in quantization ambiguities .    note , however , that the ambiguity parameters @xmath109 in the gravitational and the matter hamiltonian need not be identical . in particular , the matter hamiltonian can have a large @xmath109 even if one is forced ( or prefers ) to use a small @xmath109 for the gravitational part .",
    "the matter hamiltonian then has a significantly different dependence on the scale factor @xmath36 at small volume which generically leads to inflation @xcite .",
