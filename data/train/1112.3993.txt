    "a classical problem is to determine the optimal configurations of @xmath2 points @xmath3 on the unit sphere @xmath4 , i.e. configurations which minimize some energy function , @xmath5 natural choices of the kernel @xmath6 are the riesz kernels , @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the geodesic distance between @xmath9 .",
    "the assumption @xmath10 ensures that the riesz function @xmath11 is integrable .",
    "the minimal energy is denoted by @xmath12 for background on this problem , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the problem of minimizing energy is of interest on any compact riemannian manifold , although it seems mainly to have been studied on the standard sphere .    of course , it is a very demanding problem to determine the actual optimizers .",
    "related problems are to find the asymtotics of the minimial energy as @xmath1 and to determine the properties of asymptotically minimizing configurations , which are sometimes called elliptic fekete points .",
    "for instance , to minimize energy the points must be well - separated and equidistributed with respect to the volume form .",
    "this article is concerned with the expected energies @xmath0 of the zero sets of gaussian random systems of holomorphic polynomials and their generalizations to any compact khler manifold .",
    "thus , we do not study optimal configurations but rather consider the separation and equidistribution properties of configurations defined by random zero sets as measured by the energies .",
    "our results generalize those of a recent pair of articles @xcite in the complex one dimensional case , which showed that the zeros of gaussian random holomorphic polynomials of one complex variable are asymptotic energy minimizing configurations to a certain order in @xmath2 .",
    "the results are reviewed in  [ zh ] .",
    "such polynomials are holomorphic sections of @xmath13 , the @xmath2th power of the hyperplane bundle over the riemann sphere .",
    "it has been known for some time that in complex dimension one , the zeros of random polynomials of degree @xmath2 ( or of any holomorphic sections ) repel each other so that the nearest neighbors are almost always of order @xmath14 apart .",
    "more precisely , the probability of pairs being @xmath15 apart can be determined from the scaling asymptotics of the two - point correlation function of zeros in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ` empirical measure of zeros ' defined by @xmath16 tends to the ` equilibrium measure ' given by the riemannian area form @xcite .",
    "the leading order asymptotics of the energy mainly reflect this repulsion and equidistribution .",
    "repulsion and equidistribution are not sufficient to ensure that random zero point configurations asymptotically minimize energy , and indeed one would not expect a random configuration to do as well as a carefully chosen one .",
    "but in complex dimension one , random zero sets do surprisingly well ( see  [ zh ] ) .    in this article , we consider the expected energies of the zero ses of a random full system of @xmath17 holomorphic polynomials on a complex projective space @xmath18 of any dimension .",
    "in fact , we consider the problem for sections of ample holomorphic line bundles @xmath19 over general khler manifolds , and moreover for systems of @xmath20 holomorphic sections .",
    "we refer to the case of a full system of @xmath17 polynomials in complex dimension @xmath17 , whose simultaneous zero set is ( almost surely ) a discrete set of points , as the _ point case _ or equivalently as the _ discrete case_.    in higher dimensions , we do not expect the complex zeros in the discrete case to asymptotically minimize energy .",
    "they do become equidstributed with respect to the equilibrium measure but they are not well separated . as recalled in ",
    "[ pcc ] , the scaling limits of the pair correlation function of zeros were calcuated in @xcite in all dimensions and co - dimensions .",
    "the results show that , in the point case , the zeros almost ignore each other with only a slight repulsion at very close distances in dimension 2 , and they in fact attract or clump together in higher dimensions .",
    "the results of this article give a somewhat different perspective on the separation of the zeros as reflected by energy asymptotics , or more precisely on the distance of zeros from the discriminant variety of polynomial systems with a double root ( see  [ config ] ) .    before stating our results on expected energies ,",
    "let us review what is known about the minimum energies of configurations of points in the point case so that we can compare expected energies to minimal energies .",
    "first , we review results on @xmath21 .",
    "we caution that different authors use slightly different normalizations of the radius of the sphere and the choice of riesz kernels and the coefficients of the asymptotic energies reflect these choices .",
    "in @xcite , the authors consider the energy with @xmath22^s},\\,\\,\\ , ( s\\neq 0 ) ; \\ ; \\mbox{resp . }   \\;\\ ; g_0(z , w )   =    \\log \\frac{1}{[z , w ] } , \\,\\,\\,\\ , ( s=0).\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 $ ] is the chordal distance between two points on @xmath24 rather than the geodesic distance as in ( [ riea ] ) .",

    "the asymptotic energy @xmath30 on the standard @xmath4 was further studied in @xcite .",
    "theorem 3.1 of @xcite asserts that if @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 then for the standard @xmath4 one has @xmath33 for certain explicit constants @xmath34 .",

    "i.e. the kernel of @xmath40 on the orthogonal complement of the constant functions , n. elkies proved the general lower bound @xmath41 proofs can be found in @xcite . in complex dimension one ,",
    "the lower bound follows from mahler s inequalities @xcite .",

    "we continue to denote them by @xmath60 , leaving it to the context to make clear how may factors of @xmath52 are involved .",
    "product measure corresponds to choosing @xmath20 independent random sections , hence a gaussian random system .",
    "we define @xmath0 to be the expected ( average ) value of the energy of the zeros of gaussian random sections chosen from the ensemble @xmath63 . in the discrete case , @xmath64    before stating our results in the discrete case , we recall the results of @xcite when @xmath65 . in the special case of the standard metric on @xmath4 and with the logarithm riesz energy , it is proved in @xcite that @xmath66 in our notation , @xmath4 is the khler manifold @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) is the fubini - study metric and the holomorphic line bundle @xmath55 is hyperplane line bundle @xmath70 ; the area of @xmath71 equals @xmath72 , hence is the round @xmath4 of radius @xmath73 .",
    "the expected energy of @xmath2 randomly chosen points ( i.e. from the binomial point process ) equals @xmath74 thus , the @xmath75 term reflects the lower energy of well - separated points .    to be precise , q. zhong @xcite obtained general asymptotic results for any khler metric on any riemann surface , where the energy was defined in terms of the green s function , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the robin function such that @xmath78 .",
