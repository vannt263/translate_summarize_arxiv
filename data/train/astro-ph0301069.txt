    "much has been learned about the mass distribution and internal dynamics of galaxies by modeling their observed kinematics with solutions of the jeans equations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the jeans equations connect the second - order velocity moments ( or the velocity dispersions , if the mean streaming motion is known ) directly to the density and the gravitational potential of the galaxy , without the need to know the phase - space distribution function @xmath0 . in nearly all cases there",
    "are fewer jeans equations than velocity moments , so that additional assumptions have to be made about the degree of anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , the resulting second moments may not correspond to a physical distribution function @xmath1 .",
    "these significant drawbacks have not prevented wide application of the jeans approach to the kinematics of spherical and axisymmetric galaxies .",
    "many ( components of ) galaxies have triaxial shapes ( @xcite , @xcite ) , including early - type bulges , bars , and giant elliptical galaxies . in this geometry , there are three jeans equations , but little use has been made of them , as they contain six independent second moments , three of which have to be chosen ad - hoc ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an exception is provided by the special set of triaxial mass models that have a gravitational potential of stckel form . in these systems ,",
    "the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation separates in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates ( @xcite ) , so that all orbits have three exact integrals of motion , which are quadratic in the velocities .",
    "the three mixed second - order velocity moments vanish , so that the three jeans equations for the three remaining second moments form a closed system .",
    "bell ( @xcite ) was the first to derive the explicit form of these jeans equations .",
    "he showed that they constitute a highly symmetric set of three first - order partial differential equations for three unknowns , each of which is a function of the ellipsoidal coordinates , but he did not derive solutions .",
    "when it was realized that the orbital structure in the triaxial stckel models is very similar to that in numerical models for triaxial galaxies with cores ( @xcite , @xcite ) , interest in the second moments increased , and the jeans equations were solved for a number of special cases .",
    "these include the axisymmetric limits and elliptic discs ( @xcite , @xcite ) , triaxial galaxies with only thin tube orbits ( @xcite ) , and the scale - free limit ( @xcite ) . in all these cases",
    "the equations simplify to a two - dimensional problem , which can be solved with standard techniques after transforming two first - order equations into a single second - order equation in one dependent variable .",
    "however , these techniques do not carry over to a single third - order equation in one dependent variable , which is the best that one could expect to have in the general case . as a result",
    ", the latter has remained unsolved .",
    "we have solved the two - dimensional case with an alternative solution method , which does not use the standard approach , but instead uses superposition of singular solutions .",
    "this approach can be extended to three dimensions , and provides the general solution for the triaxial case in closed form .",
    "we present the detailed solution method elsewhere ( @xcite ) , and here we summarise the main results . in ongoing work",
    "we will apply our solutions , and will use them together with the mean streaming motions ( @xcite ) to study the properties of the observed velocity and dispersion fields of triaxial galaxies .",
    "we define confocal ellipsoidal coordinates ( @xmath2 ) as the three roots for @xmath3 of @xmath4 with ( @xmath5 ) the usual cartesian coordinates , and with constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath9 are ellipsoids , and surfaces of constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 are hyperboloids of one and two sheets , respectively .",
    "the confocal ellipsoidal coordinates are approximately cartesian near the origin and become conical at large radii , i.e. , equivalent to spherical coordinates .",
    "we consider models with a gravitational potential of stckel form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary smooth function .",
    "this potential is the most general form for which the hamilton  jacobi equation separates ( @xcite , @xcite ) all orbits have three exact isolating integrals of motion , which are quadratic in the velocities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are no irregular orbits , so that jeans theorem is strictly valid ( @xcite ) , and the distribution function @xmath0 is a function of the three integrals .",
    "therefore , out of the six symmetric second - order velocity moments , defined as @xmath14 with density @xmath15 , the three mixed moments vanish , and we are left with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , related by three jeans equations .",
    "these were first derived by lynden ",
    "bell ( @xcite ) , and can be written in the following form ( @xcite )    - - & = & g_1 ( , , ) , [ eq : jeanstriaxial_lambdas ] + - - & = & g_2 ( , , ) , [ eq : jeanstriaxial_mus ] + - - & = & g_3 ( , , ) , [ eq : jeanstriaxial_nus ]    where we have defined the diagonal components of the stress tensor @xmath19 and the functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on the density and potential ( [ eq : formstackelpotential ] ) as @xmath23 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 follow from @xmath20 by cyclic permutation @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , the three jeans equations follow from each other by cyclic permutation .",
    "the stress components have to satisfy the following continuity conditions @xmath25 at the focal ellipse ( @xmath26 ) and focal hyperbola ( @xmath27 ) , respectively .",
    "we prefer the form ( [ eq : definitionstautau ] ) for the stresses instead of the more common definition without the square root , since it results in more convenient and compact expressions . in self - consistent models ,",
    "the density @xmath15 equals @xmath28 , with @xmath28 related to @xmath29 by poisson s equation .",
    "the jeans equations , however , do not require self - consistency , so that we make no assumptions on the form of @xmath15 other than that it is triaxial , i.e. , a function of @xmath30 , and that it tends to zero at infinity .",
    "when two or all three of the constants @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath7 in ( [ eq : defellipsiodalcoord ] ) are equal , the triaxial stckel models reduce to limiting cases with more symmetry and thus with fewer degrees of freedom .",
    "solving the jeans equations for oblate , prolate , elliptic disc and scale - free models reduces to the same two - dimensional problem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , of which the simplest form is the pair of jeans equations for stckel discs    - & = & g_1 ( , ) , [ eq : jeanselliptic_lambdas ] + - & = & g_2 ( , ) , [ eq : jeanselliptic_mus ]    with at the foci ( @xmath26 ) the continuity condition @xmath33 in this case the stress components and the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath34 where @xmath21 follows from @xmath20 by interchanging @xmath35 , and @xmath15 denotes a surface density .    the two jeans equations ( 8) can be recast into a single second - order partial differential equation in either @xmath36 or @xmath37 , which can be solved by employing standard techniques like riemann s method ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". however , these standard techniques do not carry over to the triaxial case , and we therefore introduce an alternative method , based on the superposition of singular solutions .",
    "we consider a simpler form of ( 8) by substituting for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we refer to solutions of these simplified jeans equations as _",
    "singular solutions_. singular solutions can be interpreted as contributions to the stresses at a fixed field point @xmath40 due to a source point in @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sourcepointcontribution ] ) . the full stress at the field point can be obtained by adding all source point contributions , each with a weight that depends on the local density and potential .",

    "we then construct a linear combination of these particular solutions by integrating over @xmath47 .",
    "we choose the integration contours in the complex @xmath47-plane , such that the boundary conditions ( [ eq : dischombc1and2 ] ) are satisfied simultaneously .",
    "the resulting homogeneous solutions are complex contour integrals , which can be evaluated in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind , @xmath48 , and its derivative @xmath49 , as @xmath50 we obtain a similar system of simplified jeans equations by interchanging the expressions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the singular solutions of this simplified system follow from ( [ eq : functionalformssllandsmm ] ) by interchanging @xmath35 and @xmath53 at the same time .    to find the solution to the full jeans equations ( 8) at @xmath40 , we multiply the latter singular solutions and ( [ eq : functionalformssllandsmm ] ) by @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively , and integrate over @xmath56 : @xmath57 ( fig .",

    "we are thus free to specify either of the two stress components at @xmath58 .",
    "the singular solution method introduced in the previous section can be extended to three dimensions to solve the jeans equations ( 4 ) for triaxial stckel models .",
    "although the calculations are more complex for a triaxial model , the stepwise solution method is similar to that in two dimensions .",
    "we simplify the jeans equations ( 4 ) by setting two of the three functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 to zero and the remaining equal to @xmath63 . in this way",

    "if we furthermore take @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the integration volume becomes the three - dimensional extension of @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sourcepointcontribution ] ) .    whereas the volume integral in ( [ eq : generaltriaxsolstt ] ) already solves the inhomogeneous jeans equations ( 4 ) , the three area integrals are needed to obtain the correct values at the boundary surfaces @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . on each of these surfaces",
    "the three stress components are related by two of the three jeans equations ( 4 ) and the continuity conditions ( [ eq : triaxialcontcond ] ) .",
    "since the ( weight ) functions @xmath87 are known for given @xmath15 and @xmath29 , this means that the solution ( [ eq : generaltriaxsolstt ] ) yields all three stresses everywhere in the triaxial model , once one of the stress components is prescribed on the three boundary surfaces .",
    "if we take @xmath81 and @xmath88 , the contributing boundary surfaces reduce to the single @xmath89-plane , containing the long and the short axis of the galaxy .",
    "this compares well with schwarzschild ( @xcite ) , who used the same plane to start his numerically calculated orbits from .",
    "eddington ( @xcite ) showed that the velocity ellipsoid in a triaxial galaxy with a separable potential of stckel form is everywhere aligned with the confocal ellipsoidal coordinate system in which the equations of motion separate .",
    "bell ( @xcite ) derived the three jeans equations which relate the three principal stresses to the potential and the density .",
    "solutions were found for the various two - dimensional limiting cases , but with methods that do not carry over to the general case , which remained unsolved .",
    "we have presented an alternative solution method , based on the superposition of singular solutions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this approach , unlike the standard techniques , can be generalised to solve the three - dimensional system .",
    "the resulting solutions contain complete ( hyper)elliptic integrals , which can be evaluated in a straightforward way .",
    "the general jeans solution is not unique , but requires specification of principal stresses at certain boundary surfaces , given a separable triaxial potential and a triaxial density distribution ( not necessarily the one that generates the potential ) .",
    "these boundary surfaces can be taken to be the plane containing the long and the short axis of the galaxy , and , more specifically , the part that is crossed by all three families of tube orbits and the box orbits .",
    "the set of all jeans solutions ( [ eq : generaltriaxsolstt ] ) contains all the stresses that are associated with the physical distribution functions @xmath90 , but , as in the case of spherical and axisymmetric models , also contains solutions which are unphysical , e.g. , those associated with distribution functions that are negative in some parts of phase space .",
    "the many examples of the use of spherical and axisymmetric jeans models in the literature suggest nevertheless that the jeans solutions can be of significant use .",
    "while triaxial models with a separable potential do not provide an adequate description of the nuclei of galaxies with cusped luminosity profiles and a massive central black hole ( @xcite ) , they do catch much of the orbital structure at larger radii , and in some cases even provide a good approximation of the galaxy potential .",
    "the solutions for the mean streaming motions , i.e. , the first velocity moments of the distribution function , are helpful in understanding the variety of observed velocity fields in giant elliptical galaxies and constraining their intrinsic shapes ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that the projected velocity dispersion fields that can be derived from our jeans solutions will be similarly useful , and , in particular , that they can be used to establish which combinations of viewing directions and intrinsic axis ratios are firmly ruled out by the observations .",
    "it is remarkable that the entire jeans solution can be written down by means of classical methods .",
    "this suggests that similar solutions can be found for the higher dimensional analogues of ( 4 ) , most likely involving hyperelliptic integrals of higher order .",
    "it is also likely that the higher - order velocity moments for the separable triaxial models can be found by similar analytic means , but the effort required may become prohibitive ."
