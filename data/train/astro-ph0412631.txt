    "quasars are intrinsically bright and preferentially located at relatively high redshift .",
    "they are , therefore , naturally suited for exploring the structure of the distant universe out to redshifts @xmath23 , a regime not easily accessible from existing wide - field galaxy surveys . while surveys of the universe up to @xmath24 have significantly advanced in recent years using lyman break - galaxies and lyman-@xmath25 emitters ( e.g. , @xcite ; ouchi et al .",
    "2004a ; ouchi et al .",
    "2004b ) , they remain limited in terms of the areas they cover ( barely extending to @xmath26 ) . as such they are not well suited to measuring the large scale clustering at high redshift ( i.e.  they are sample variance limited ) .",
    "quasar samples , in contrast , can be surveyed over very large volumes and , therefore , play an important and complementary role in measuring the evolution of structure in the universe on the largest accessible scales .",
    "the primary goal of this quasar clustering analysis is to directly probe and quantify the large - scale structure of the universe on scales up to a few @xmath27gpc , where @xmath28 denotes the hubble constant in units of @xmath29 .",
    "eventually such analyses may enable us to answer fundamental questions including the homogeneity of the universe on gpc scales or the validity of the cosmological principle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also the clustering signal provides important clues to the formation and evolution of quasars themselves and may shed light on the growth history of their central massive black holes .",
    "although there are several seminal papers addressing quasar clustering ( @xcite ) , those previous quasar samples were fairly small which limits their statistical power in constraining large scale structure .",
    "the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz:@xcite ) and the sdss are among the largest statistical samples which should significantly advance the statistics of quasar clustering analysis .",
    "this is the first of a series of sdss quasar clustering papers and is aimed at exploring the impact of the baryon density and the cosmological constant on the quasar 2pcf on scales of @xmath30mpc . in this sense ,",
    "our current approach is quite complementary to the existing galaxy clustering studies by the sdss collaboration ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ; pope et al .",
    "the samples and techniques are complementary : the galaxies and quasars are selected using different algorithms , they explore vastly different volumes , the number densities of the objects are very different , and they cover very different redshift ranges",
    ". it would be interesting to see if both data sets yield consistent results on constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we will address the dependence of the quasar 2pcfs on redshift and luminosity and comparison with those of galaxies and agns in a separate paper @xcite . to be specific",
    ", we compute the 2pcf of quasars from sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ) on scales from 8@xmath27mpc to 2@xmath27gpc and perform statistical analyses that pay particular attention to the embedded baryonic signature . from recent progress in the theoretical and observational understanding of the initial conditions present in the early universe ,",
    "the 2pcf of the matter is well described .",
    "two characteristic scales in the matter 2pcf , @xmath31 , are present at approximately 100@xmath32 ; the baryon bump and the zero - crossing point ( denoted by @xmath33 in what follows ) .",
    "these features are sensitive to the baryon density parameter , @xmath5 , and the matter density parameter , @xmath34 , where we define @xmath35 , with @xmath7 being the density parameter of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "we derive constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath8 assuming a spatially flat universe ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) throughout this paper . our attempt may be partially interpreted as yet another cosmological test to determine the values of @xmath5 and @xmath8 independent of existing methods . in this respect ,",
    "our current results discussed below are not stringent enough to improve the previous constraints .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the attempt to look for the baryonic signature in the cosmological distribution of quasars is of scientific interest on its own .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss;@xcite for a technical summary ) provides the largest homogeneous sample of quasars currently available , and thus is best suited for our current purpose .",
    "the wide - field five band photometric system ( @xcite ) enables the identification of quasars with high efficiency and completeness .",
    "the precision astrometry @xcite maintains the accuracy of the clustering analysis even in 100@xmath37 scale .",
    "the sdss is also excellent in terms of the homogeneity of the spectroscopic sample because its spectroscopic targets are selected consistently on the basis of their photometric data .",
    "the details of quasar target selection algorithm are described by @xcite , and the spectroscopic tiling algorithm is described by @xcite .      the spectroscopic sample of quasars in the dr4 is selected according to several different spectroscopic target selection criteria ( see table 27 of @xcite ) .",
    "we consider only the point sources , and extract our quasar sample for the current analysis on the basis of four conditions ; first , to ensure a homogeneity of the sample , we choose those spectroscopic quasars whose `` primtarget '' flag ( see table 6 of @xcite ) indicates either `` qso_cap '' or `` qso_skirt '' ( see fig.1 and section 3.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "second , their @xmath3-band magnitude corrected for the galactic reddening should satisfy @xmath38 , which are the limits used by the quasar target selection algorithm . we adopt the reddening correction of @xcite .",
    "although this correction is calculated adopting the typical spectrum energy distribution of elliptical galaxies and the old sdss filter response functions the resulting difference is negligibly small .",
    "third , the redshift limits of this sample are @xmath39 . in the sdss photometric system , the color locus of quasars in the redshift range @xmath40 crosses the stellar locus and thus the survey completeness becomes significantly degraded in that redshift range .",
    "this defines the upper redshift limit of our sample .",
    "the lower limit is chosen so that the absolute magnitude of all the selected quasars should be brighter than -23 in i - band .",
    "finally , we exclude the southern sky region because the selection of the region is different from that of the northern sky .",
    "the total number of selected quasars is 19986 .",
    "the sdss photometric data have two different versions ; `` best '' version denotes the highest quality data at the time of the data release , while `` target '' version is the data at the time the target selection algorithm was run for that part of the sky ( i.e. , the photometric data may be updated at the time of the data release ) .",
    "our current sample uses the `` primtarget '' flag which is based on the `` target '' version .",
    "in reality , however , the two versions may lead to some systematic effect due to the mismatch of the time - dependent selection function .",
    "we compared best and target using the sdss data release 3 ( dr3 : see @xcite ) qso catalog @xcite , and found that the difference does not affect the resulting 2pcfs within the current errorbars ( see fig.[fig : sdss_n1 ] below ) .",
    "we note that our sample in the dr3 region slightly differs from dr3 qso catalog @xcite because we have not manually inspected all objects classified by the _ pipeline _ as quasars .",
    "the number of quasars in a subset of our dr4 sample that is located in the dr3 region is 16656 , out of which 32 objects are not listed in the catalog of @xcite and 9 objects have incorrect redshifts .",
    "this difference of the quasar samples , however , has a negligible effect on the estimated 2pcf as will be shown below .",
    "the equatorial coordinate distribution of our quasar sample is plotted in figure [ fig : quasar - distribution ] , and a projected wedge diagram of the quasars is shown in figure [ fig : wedge_quasar ] .",
    "figure [ fig : m_z ] shows the scatter plot of redshift and @xmath3-band absolute magnitude ( _ upper panel _ ) and the redshift histogram ( _ lower panel _ ) .    giving the errorbars in fig.[fig : sdss_n1 ] , the photometric completeness , fiber collisions and the effect of errors in the reddening correction are not supposed to change our result .",
    "those issues will be fully addressed by @xcite who found that none appears to significantly affect the quasar 2pcfs presented below .",
    "we use the landy - szalay estimator @xcite in computing the 2pcf from the quasar sample : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the number of corresponding pairs of quasars and random particles that are normalized by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , respectively ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the numbers of quasars and random particles ) .",
    "the accuracy and convergent properties of the landy ",
    "szalay estimator are discussed in the appendix of @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution of random particles is determined so as to reproduce that of the quasars .",
    "the latter is estimated by averaging over a finite width of redshift , @xmath50 .",
    "we find that other choices of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 result in almost identical @xmath54 .",
    "the number of random particles , @xmath49 , is about 600,000 , which is found to provide robust estimates of @xmath54 on the scales @xmath55 .",
    "we evaluate the covariance matrix , @xmath56 , from 40 jack - knife re - samplings ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to ensure the statistical significance ,",
    "the comparison between the observed and the predicted 2pcfs needs to be done after the finite binning of the pair - separation .",
    "empirically , we compute the 2pcfs at 6 different binning offsets ; the @xmath3-th boundary of the @xmath57-th binning offset ( @xmath58 ) is defined as @xmath59 we then compute the averaged 2pcfs of theoretical predictions ( described in section 3 ) as follows : @xmath60 in practice , for a given @xmath57-th offset of the binning , we use bins whose boundaries satisfy @xmath61 for the following analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : sdss_n1 ] plots the 2pcfs of our samples for the @xmath62 binning offset adopting @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we also plot the 2pcfs of a subset of our dr4 sample that is located in the dr3 region , and two 2pcfs of best and target samples of the dr3 quasar catalog @xcite for comparison .",
    "the four sets of 2pcfs agree with one another to within 1@xmath10 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we show the 2pcfs in log - log plots . in order to show the negative part of 2pcfs",
    ", we plot the range of @xmath66 in the lower panel of each figure by taking the logarithm of its absolute value .",
    "since the baryon bump is the counterpart of the acoustic oscillation peaks in a matter power spectrum , the analysis using the 2pcf should , in principle , be equivalent to that with the power spectrum .",
    "nevertheless we perform the analysis with the 2pcf for the following two reasons .",
    "the first advantage is based on the different behavior of the baryonic signature in the power spectrum and 2pcf .",
    "while the acoustic oscillation peaks in a matter power spectrum show up in several overtones , they translate coherently to the baryon bump in the 2pcf roughly at one specific scale .",
    "thus the resulting signature is expected to be more prominent in the 2pcf .",
    "the second is related to the inevitably complicated geometry of the survey volume boundary .",
    "strictly speaking , the estimate of the power spectrum from the observed sample has to assume a periodic boundary condition unless resorting to a very sophisticated estimation methodology ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2pcf can be reliably estimated by taking account of the arbitrary boundary shape of the survey volume in a relatively straightforward fashion .",
    "for this purpose , we simply distribute random particles over the survey volume according to the selection function of quasars ( the lower - panel of fig.[fig : m_z ] ) and perform standard pair - counting .",
    "this is why we adopt the 2pcf in the present analysis .    in locating the baryon bump and the zero - crossing point , it is important to have accurate predictions of the matter 2pcf .",
    "here we adopt an empirical fitting formula for the cdm transfer function incorporating the effect of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model of 2pcfs depends on @xmath34 and @xmath5 and not on @xmath8 , while the estimate of the observed 2pcfs requires the values of @xmath34 and @xmath8 . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "therefore , we adopt a spatially - flat universe , @xmath67 , and choose @xmath5 and @xmath8 as two model parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : baryon ] shows @xmath68 for different values of @xmath5 ( @xmath8 is fixed to @xmath69 ) .",
    "baryon bumps are always visible around @xmath70mpc ( except for the case of @xmath71 ) and their height and position are sensitive to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : lambda ] also plots @xmath68 but for different values of @xmath8 assuming @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath33 is very sensitive to @xmath8 and , to a lesser extent , to @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : hubble ] shows the dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath28 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath33 is quite insensitive to the value of the hubble constant . if @xmath71 , the cdm linear matter spectrum is approximately given as a universal function of the scaled wavenumber , @xmath72 implying the scaling of @xmath73 \\propto ( \\omega_{\\rm m}h)^{-1}$ ] ( see also @xcite for related discussion on the parameter dependence ) .",
    "we made sure that this scaling holds for @xmath74 but is replaced by a different empirical relation of @xmath75 \\propto \\omega_{\\rm m}^{-1 } = ( 1-\\omega_\\lambda)^{-1}$ ] for @xmath76 ( the second equality comes from our assumption of the spatially flat universe ) .",
    "we note here that the above feature may be very useful in breaking the degeneracy in the constraints on @xmath34 and @xmath28 .      in order to predict the observable 2pcf of quasars @xmath77 from the matter 2pcf @xmath78",
    ", one has to take into account three major effects , ( i ) the light - cone effect , ( ii ) redshift - space distortion and ( iii ) quasar biasing .",
    "since the formulation and the prescription of incorporating these effects have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , we simply summarize the results below .",
    "since the current quasar sample extends from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , the clustering evolution within the survey volume can not be neglected ; for instance , the linear growth rate of density fluctuations , @xmath81 , in the universe with @xmath82 and @xmath19 varies from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "this implies that the corresponding matter 2pcf in the linear regime evolves by a factor of @xmath85 ^ 2 \\approx 3.1 $ ] between the two edges of the survey volume .",
    "although we could reduce the effect in principle by dividing the entire sample into several subsamples in a narrow redshift range , it would appreciably degrade the statistical significance of the result .",
    "this is why one has to carry out the proper averaging procedure in predicting @xmath77 theoretically . to be specific ,",
    "we follow the formula described by @xcite : @xmath86 ^ 2\\xi_{\\rm qso}(s , z ) } } { \\displaystyle \\int^{z_{\\rm max}}_{z_{\\rm min}}dz \\frac{dv_c}{dz}\\left[\\phi(z ) n_0(z)\\right]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the redshift range of the survey , @xmath89 is the differential comoving volume element , @xmath90 is the selection function of quasars , @xmath91 is the number density of quasars , and @xmath92 is the 2pcf of quasars in redshift space at @xmath93 .    in practice ,",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ eq : xilc_qso1 ] ) as @xmath94 in the above expression , @xmath95 is the redshift number distribution of quasars which is directly estimated from the data ( lower panel of fig.[fig : m_z ] ) , and @xmath89 can be easily computed once a set of cosmological parameters is specified .",
    "the next task is to convert the theoretical predictions in real space to those in redshift space .",
    "since the current paper focuses on scales beyond @xmath96mpc , the nonlinear effect ( i.e. , fingers of god ) is not important and we may just consider the kaiser effect @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote the quasar pair - separations ( comoving ) in real and redshift spaces , respectively , @xmath100 is the scale factor , and @xmath101 is the biasing factor of quasars at @xmath93 as described below .",
    "this expression assumes the distant - observer approximation , and can be justified for pair - separations less than @xmath102 on the sky @xcite . for reference , at the median redshift of @xmath103 , the comoving scale subtended by an angle of @xmath102 is @xmath104mpc in the @xmath105 and @xmath13 model .",
    "this is why we only use the bins less than 502 @xmath27mpc where the distant - observer approximation can be reasonably justified .",
    "the quasar biasing could be fairly complex in principle , but again in the linear regime that we consider here , one can safely assume the scale - independent and linear bias ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath106 ^ 2\\xi_{\\rm m}(r , z ) = \\left[{b_{\\rm qso}(z)}\\right]^2 d(z)^2 \\xi_{\\rm",
    "m}(r,0 ) .\\ ] ] then it should be emphasized here that all the above three effects ( the light cone effect , the redshift - space distortion , and the quasar biasing ) are linear in a sense that equations ( [ eq : xilc_qso2 ] ) to ( [ eq : xibias_qso ] ) yield a linear relation between the quasar 2pcf in redshift space on the light - cone and the matter 2pcf in real space at @xmath16 .",
    "in particular the three effects simply change the amplitude of the matter 2pcf but none changes the positions of the baryon bump and the zero - crossing scale .",
    "this is valid only in the linear regime , and significantly simplifies the analysis .",
    "consequently we can simply introduce an effective biasing factor , @xmath107 : @xmath108 and @xmath109 we note a possible systematic effect that gives rise to scale - dependence in the effective bias : if mean redshifts of quasar pairs which contribute to small - scale and large - scale correlations are significantly different , the biasing measured on the light - cone may acquire artificial scale - dependence .",
    "in other words , the redshift dependence of the selection function combined with that of the _ scale - independent _ bias may induce additional scale - dependence in the effective bias .",
    "for instance , @xcite discussed in detail how the luminosity dependence yields such scale - dependence of biasing using a subset of the dr2 sdss galaxy catalog . in the current sample ,",
    "however , this is not a serious problem for two reasons .",
    "first , while the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering is well established @xcite , it is not yet clear that quasars also exhibit similar strong dependence on their intrinsic properties .",
    "@xcite , for instance , find no significant luminosity dependence in the clustering of 2df qsos .",
    "second , as is clear from the qso distribution plot and @xmath110 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : quasar - distribution ] and [ fig : wedge_quasar ] ) , all separation bins of the 2pcf that we use in the analysis are not dominated by those in any specific redshift range , rather they are contributed equally over the entire redshift range . to be more specific ,",
    "we compute the mean redshifts of pairs , @xmath111 , at separation bins of @xmath99 assuming @xmath105 and @xmath13 .",
    "we find ( @xmath111 , @xmath99 ) = ( 1.40 , @xmath112mpc ) , ( 1.41 , @xmath113mpc ) , ( 1.41 , @xmath70mpc ) , ( 1.41 , @xmath114mpc ) , ( 1.41 , @xmath115mpc ) , ( 1.42 , @xmath116mpc ) , and ( 1.41,@xmath117mpc ) .",
    "this reasonably justifies the fact that we neglect the luminosity dependence of quasar biasing .",
    "thus we proceed as follows ; first we specify the values of @xmath118 , @xmath8 , and @xmath28 , then compute @xmath119 . since we assume",
    "the spatially flat model , @xmath34 is given as @xmath120 .",
    "as discussed below , we do not have to specify the value of @xmath14 , the top - hat mass fluctuation amplitude at @xmath15mpc , as long as we do not intend to solve for @xmath121 .",
    "second we evaluate @xmath77 from the quasar sample using the same values of @xmath34 , @xmath8 , and @xmath28 . finally , we compute the @xmath122 of the observed and the model 2pcfs by varying the value of @xmath107 . in doing so , we use both diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the inverse matrix of the covariance matrix and the subscripts , @xmath3 and @xmath125 , are indices of separation bins .",
    "we repeat the above procedure for @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and derive constraints on the two parameters .",
    "we adopt @xmath65 as a fiducial value , but also show results for @xmath128 and @xmath129 as well , although the @xmath28-dependence is very weak .",
    "the resulting constraints are independent of the value of @xmath14 and also of the evolution model of @xmath121 .",
    "nevertheless it is also interesting to estimate the quasar biasing factor even in a model - dependent manner .",
    "we adopt a simple evolution model by @xcite : @xmath130 this model neglects the possible luminosity / color dependence of quasar biasing and the finite lifetime of quasars , and may need to be improved to some extent ; we note that @xcite find no significant luminosity dependence in the clustering of 2df qsos .",
    "nevertheless equation ( [ eq : frybias ] ) gives us a useful measure of the expected degree of the quasar spatial biasing at @xmath16 .",
    "in performing the statistical analysis , we recompute @xmath131 for different values of @xmath8 ( @xmath127 at an interval of @xmath132 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sdss_lambda ] shows the observed 2pcfs of the sdss quasars for several different values of @xmath8 ( the @xmath62 binning offset ) . each data point and associated errorbar",
    "is slightly shifted horizontally for clarity . unlike in figures [ fig : baryon ] to [ fig : hubble ] , the baryon bump is not directly visible due to the large bin size . because of the statistical limitation , we also do not directly detect the anti - correlation that is predicted beyond a scale of 200@xmath27mpc ( in the case of @xmath12 and @xmath13 universe ) .",
    "however , we find that there is a break in the slope of the 2pcf around 100@xmath27mpc . while @xmath54 is always positive on the scales less than 100 @xmath27mpc , it is not inconsistent to be negative on the larger scale for any sets of cosmological parameters that we surveyed here .",
    "thus this break may be interpreted to put a lower limit on the zero - crossing scale of @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig : binning ] shows the 2pcfs of sdss quasars using the 6 different binning offsets ( @xmath63 and @xmath133 ) .",
    "the break of @xmath54 around 100@xmath27mpc is quite robust against the different choice of the binning .",
    "since the data at different bins are strongly correlated , we do not use this entire dataset for our analysis ; this is just to show that the binning makes little difference . in what follows ,",
    "we perform statistical analysis for the @xmath62 and @xmath134 offsets , separately .    figure [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 1 ] shows the corresponding contours of @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the value of @xmath107 which minimizes @xmath122 for a given set of @xmath5 and @xmath8 , and @xmath137 is the global minimum value in @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath107 parameter space .",
    "the three curves represent the 68% , 95% and 99.7% confidence levels .",
    "figure [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 25 ] is the same plot but employs the @xmath134 binning offset ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : binning ] ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters inferred from the wmap results @xcite are in agreement with our constraints in figures [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 1 ] and [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 25 ] at the 68% confidence level . given these uncertainties , therefore",
    ", we express our constraints as allowed regions of @xmath5 and @xmath8 . for this purpose",
    ", we fit the mean and @xmath138 contours as straight lines and obtain @xmath139 for the @xmath62 binning offset ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2_bin030 - 1 ] ) , and @xmath140 for the @xmath134 binning offset ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2_bin030 - 25 ] ) .",
    "these fitted lines are also plotted in figures [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 1 ] and [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 25 ] . the differences of the slopes of contours between the @xmath62 and @xmath134 binning offsets mainly come from the smallest - scale behavior of @xmath141 , but the resulting constraints are fairly insensitive to the different binning offsets ( compare figs . [",
    "fig : chi2_bin030 - 1 ] and [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 25 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of our constraints on the hubble constant is illustrated in figure [ fig : hubble_chi2 ] .",
    "the upper and lower panels are derived by employing the @xmath62 and @xmath134 offsets , respectively .",
    "the left and right panels show the results for @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , and the central panels plot the results for @xmath65 ( identical to figures [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 1 ] and [ fig : chi2_bin030 - 25 ] ) for comparison . except for the small difference ,",
    "the overall conclusion is that our constraints are very insensitive to the choice of @xmath28 .",
    "finally , let us consider the corresponding biasing parameter of quasars implied from the current study .",
    "unfortunately the current sample can not constrain the redshift - dependence on the bias evolution .",
    "thus we have to specify the value of @xmath14 ( at z=0 ) and the evolution model of quasar biasing as well , although all the constraints presented above are independent of those assumptions . for simplicity and clarity ,",
    "we adopt @xmath18 and @xmath142 .",
    "then we find that @xmath107 is @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "if we define a `` mean '' quasar bias as @xmath145^{-1},\\ ] ] we find that @xmath146 ( the mean redshift of the sample is @xmath147 ) .",
    "this is a measure of the degree of quasar clustering if the quasar biasing is _ independent of redshift_. we think this result is consistent with @xcite .",
    "if we adopt another bias evolution ( eq.[[eq : frybias ] ] ) instead , the current quasar sample is fitted to have @xmath148 .",
    "we have presented the first result of the sdss quasar clustering analysis . in particular",
    "we have focused on the behavior of the quasar two - point correlation functions ( 2pcf ) at large scales , and explored the embedded baryonic signature through the overall shape of the quasar 2pcf .",
    "the measurement is still statistically limited , but we found that the zero - crossing scale of the quasar 2pcfs is larger than @xmath70mpc .",
    "the estimated quasar 2pcfs are in good agreement with those predicted in linear theory combining the light - cone effect , the redshift - space distortion and the scale - independent linear biasing model .    to proceed further , we have attempted to derive joint constraints on the baryon density parameter @xmath5 and the cosmological constant @xmath8 under the assumption of the spatially flat universe .",
    "our constraints are approximately expressed by the relation : @xmath149 at the 2@xmath10 confidence level ( @xmath62 binning offset ) . while the statistical significance is not competitive ,",
    "the constraint is consistent with the independent results from other observations such as wmap @xcite within the @xmath150 level .",
    "the current analysis can be improved in many different ways ; to consider non - flat ( @xmath151 ) models , to explore a more general equation of state of the universe than the cosmological constant ( e.g. , yamamoto 2004 ) , to consider the anisotropy of the 2-dimensional correlation function @xcite , to incorporate the gravitational nonlinearity effect which is not important on @xmath152mpc scales but still can not be entirely neglected ( changbom park , private communication ) , to take into account the finite angular size of the pair - separation ( i.e. , without adopting the distant - observer approximation ; see matsubara 2000 ) , and to elaborate on the statistical modeling , in particular , the error estimation .",

    "the wedge diagram of the current quasar sample , figure [ fig : wedge_quasar ] , clearly illustrates the isotropy and homogeneity of the universe viewed over large scales , in marked contrast to the complex clustering pattern of the local universe traced by galaxies ( e.g. , fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the most impressive lesson that we have learned from the current analysis may be the fact that we can indeed decipher cosmological information on @xmath5 and @xmath8 which is imprinted in the apparently almost homogeneous distribution of quasars at such high redshifts .",

    "<S> the redshift range of the sample is @xmath1 ( the mean redshift is @xmath2 ) and the reddening - corrected @xmath3-band apparent magnitude range is @xmath4 . due to the relatively low number density of the quasar sample , the bump in the power spectrum due to the baryon density , @xmath5 , </S>",

    "<S> where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the density parameters of dark matter and the cosmological constant , we combine the observed quasar 2pcf and the predicted matter 2pcf to put constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> our result is fitted as @xmath9 at the 2@xmath10 confidence level , which is consistent with results from other cosmological observations such as wmap . </S>",
    "<S> the `` mean '' bias parameter of our quasar sample is @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 is the top - hat mass fluctuation amplitude at @xmath15mpc . </S>",
