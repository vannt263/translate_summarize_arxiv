    "one of the most exciting aspects of dawson  watanabe superprocesses is their connection to quasilinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) with singular boundary condition .",

    "establishing such a direct connection is the main goal of this paper .",
    "the connection we find is direct insofar as it avoids the use of hjb equations and instead uses a probabilistic verification argument based solely on the log - laplace equation for a certain @xmath0-functional of a superprocess .",
    "while the standard verification argument relies on the existence of smooth solutions to the hjb equation , whose existence is often very difficult to establish , the `` mild solutions '' provided by the log - laplace functionals of superprocesses are ideally suited for carrying out the verification argument .",
    "they are also superior to the commonly used viscosity solutions , because the latter do not go well along with it calculus due to their possible lack of smoothness .",

    "we assume here that @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a strictly positive function and @xmath7 is a nonnegative additive functional of the ( time - inhomogeneous ) markov process @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xmath10-a.s .",

    "also , as we will explain in section [ financesection ] , problems of this type have recently appeared in the context of mathematical finance . in the next section",
    "we will give some heuristic arguments that explain the connection of this problem with quasilinear pdes with singular terminal condition that are related to superprocesses .",

    ", we will need a sharp _ upper _ bound on @xmath35 for @xmath38 close to @xmath39 .",

    "these bounds may be of independent interest .",

    "let @xmath41 be a square - integrable martingale , which will be interpreted as the price process of an asset . in the linear almgren ",
    "chriss market impact model , a strategy @xmath14 as described above is interpreted as the policy of an investor who wishes to liquidate @xmath42 shares of the asset throughout the time interval @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "this liquidation creates price impact so that the investor trades at price @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a constant and the process @xmath6 describes the intraday liquidity fluctuations ; see @xcite , @xcite and the survey @xcite for details .",

    "this is a straightforward exercise when @xmath48 is constant and strategies are deterministic , but not so easy when strategies are adapted .",
    "the reason for this difficulty is the time inconsistency of the mean - variance functional , which precludes the use of control techniques ; see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .    as a way out",
    ", one can use an infinitesimal re - optimization process as in section  6.4 of @xcite or other , more generally available arguments such as those in @xcite or @xcite to replace the original , time - inconsistent problem by a time - consistent approximation .",
