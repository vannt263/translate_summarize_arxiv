    "one of the major problems in modern astrophysics is to determine physical parameters of stars , masses and ages , and their kinematics .",
    "whereas various methods exist , most of them are not suitable for large stellar samples .",
    "thus the most common approach is fitting to stellar evolution models , i.e. , comparison of an observed location of a star in the @xmath9 plane with isochrones or evolutionary tracks for a given metallicity and @xmath10-enhancement .",
    "this method demands stellar atmospheric parameters as an input , which can be derived from photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or spectroscopy @xcite , or some combination thereof ( e.g. application to sdss / segue data in * ? ? ?",
    "the drawback of photometry is that it depends on reddening , which is difficult to estimate , and demands calibration of metallicity and alpha - enhancement on spectroscopic data .",
    "additionally , information on gravity is not obtained directly , a quantity needed to accurately determine distances .",
    "the alternative and preferable method is to use spectroscopy directly , that allows a consistent determination of all atmospheric quantitites , effective temperature , surface gravity , and element abundances , simultaneously .",
    "thus , it minimizes the the total error caused by various sources of uncertainties inherent to different methods of parameter determination .    with the advent of large - scale stellar surveys such as rave @xcite , gcs @xcite , sdss / segue @xcite , gaia - eso @xcite",
    "much attention has been devoted to developing sophisticated statistical methods to best exploit the available spectroscopic and photometric information .",
    "the basic technique of isochrone fitting ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or a combination of complementary techniques @xcite , have evolved into more systematic methods that can be applied to very large amounts of data .",
    "different alternatives based on a frequentist approach ( e.g. @xcite ) or bayesian analysis of ever increasing sophistication @xcite have been presented and their advantages and disadvantages discussed @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "spectrophotometric determination of masses , ages , and distances for late - type stars is nowadays routinely applied in large - scale stellar surveys and , although with different implementations , lies at the core of almost all studies aimed at characterizing stellar populations in the milky way , both in the intrinsic stellar properties such as age - metallicity relations @xcite as well as in their kinematical properties @xcite .",
    "however , in these studies little or no attention has been given to the physical accuracy of stellar atmospheric parameters , which , in one way or another , always rely on models describing radiative transport in stellar atmospheres . in spectroscopy ,",
    "all theoretical grids of synthetic stellar spectra for late - type stars have been computed based on the assumptions of local thermodynamic and 1d hydrostatic equilibrium ( hereafter 1d lte ) .",
    "these are , for example , the widely - used synthetic spectra grids by @xcite , which rely on the kurucz 1d lte model atmosphere and radiative transfer codes .",
    "however , recent observational and theoretial studies revealed substantial systematic biases in basic stellar parameters at low metallicity and/or gravity caused by the breakdown of lte and 1d hydrostatic equilibrium approximations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it must be pointed out that these biases are ubiquitous , and affect the results obtained from the analysis of high- and low - resolution spectra .",
    "the reason is that departures from 1d he and lte often change equivalent widths ( or , equivalently , line indices ) , and consequently abundances inferred from a diagnostic spectral feature .",
    "this effect does not vanish with a decreasing spectral resolution , which merely alters the line profile shape without affecting the total energy absorbed in a line .",
    "although no detailed quantitative estimates have been performed so far , one may also expect a non - negligible impact on certain photometric indices . as a consequence ,",
    "it is completely unknown whether , and how , systematic errors in basic stellar parameters caused by the assumptions of 1d lte impact the inferred stellar properties , that is , in our context , ages , masses , and distances .    in ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper 1 ) , we presented a comprehensive study of systematic errors in the determination of spectroscopic stellar parameters arising from using the classical method of excitation - ionization balance of fe@xmath11i and fe@xmath11ii lines based on 1d lte model atmospheres .",
    "based on the results for the large sample of metal - poor stars ( @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath12 ) selected from the rave catalogue , we concluded that the impact of using inaccurate effective temperature scale and neglecting the effects of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) on the determination of gravities and metallicities leads to systematic biases of up to @xmath13 k in effective temperature , @xmath14 dex in surface gravity and @xmath15 dex in metallicity can be obtained by independent means , i.e. , from high - quality photometry with a careful correction for reddening .",
    "a more reasonable way is to resort to standard methods relying on global @xmath16 minimization , as e.g. in @xcite , using , however , the synthetic grids computed completely in nlte . such a code is currently being developed by one of the co - authors and will be applied to a large dataset of low - resolution spectra . ] . in this work ,",
    "we use results from paper 1 to analyze the impact of using physically accurate spectroscopic stellar parameters on the determination of their masses , ages , and distances .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : section  [ sec : obs ] gives details on the observational data and the different techniques used in the determination of basic spectroscopic parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] is a brief description of the grid of stellar evolution models computed for this work . in section  [ sec : bayes ] we describe the novel bayesian method we apply to obtain masses , ages and , distances , and discuss the limitations , particularly imposed by the degeneracy of stellar models on the observational plane .",
    "we present the results in section  [ sec : results ] and compare them with those published by the rave collaboration .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we summarize the impact of our findings in the broader context of galactic structure studies and emphasize the absolute need of accurate spectroscopic stellar parameters in order to fully exploit the enormous amount and quality of data emerging from large - scale stellar surveys .",
    "[ sec : obs ]    the observed dataset was taken from @xcite and it comprises the core of the sample used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper 1 ) as well .",
    "these stars were originally selected for high - resolution observations based on data obtained by the radial velocity experiment survey ( rave ; @xcite ) in order to study the metal - poor thick disk of the milky way .",
    "high signal - to - noise spectra for these stars were obtained using high - resolution echelle spectrographs ( @xmath17 and s / n @xmath18 per pixel ) at several facilities around the world . for the present work",
    ", the final sample contains 254 stars in the metallicity range . with respect to the full sample",
    ", we have excluded horizontal branch candidates because the grid of stellar models used here extends only up to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "also , stars with have not been considered to avoid large extrapolations from the grid of nlte corrections that extends down to @xmath19 @xcite stellar parameters were determined using two different techniques , as described in detail in paper 1 and summarized below .",
    "first , we apply the classical method of 1d lte excitation - ionization equilibrium of fe@xmath11i and fe@xmath11ii , which relies on the minimization of the abundance trends with reduced line equivalent widths and lower level excitation potential .",
    "@xmath20 and microturbulence are optimized to establish excitation balance , and @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] are found by simultaneously requiring ionization balance .",
    "notwithstanding the physical limitations due to the assumptions of 1d lte , the method is still in widespread use today because of its simplicity and easiness of implementation .",
    "in the second approach , substantial efforts were made to improve the accuracy of basic stellar parameters in the attempt to minimize the above - mentioned systematic errors .",
    "firstly , effective temperatures were determined from different methods available for cool stars ( such as the balmer lines , semi - empirically calibrated photometry ) .",
    "the final , optimal , @xmath20 is that derived from the weighted averaging of different methods . in a second step , we recomputed gravities and metallicites relaxing the lte assumption and adopting the new @xmath20 scale .",
    "the nlte corrections were applied to fe@xmath11i abundances using the new wrapper code to moog .",

    "note that these are the absolute errors ( systematic + internal ) on the accuracy of our stellar parameters .",
    "similar errors bars are typically quoted in standard techniques .",
    "however , usually those represent the internal precision of a method only .",
    "the results obtained by the lte - fe method are affected by much larger systematic errors . in the paper 1",
    ", we contrasted our results for stars with surface gravities and temperatures determined by independent techniques , i.e. , from accurate _",
    "hipparcos _ parallaxes and interferometry .",
    "we found that while the lte - fe surface gravities were systematically too low by @xmath24 dex , the nlte - opt surface gravities were in agreement with astrometric values to @xmath25 dex .",

    "bayesian inference offers a powerful way to characterize a system by allowing the incorporation of prior knowledge into the statistical analysis in an objective way . in the context of our problem , i.e. determination of fundamental stellar parameters ,",

    "a key advantage of bayesian inference is that , as expressed before , it allows using prior knowledge about the problem being considered .",
    "priors are particularly important when a quantity of interest , affected by the prior , has noticeable changes within the range of observational uncertainties where the likelihood does not change much .",
    "a typical example , originally discussed by @xcite and further expanded by @xcite , is the different evolutionary speed of stellar models that populate the same region of observed parameters .",
    "when this is not accounted for , as in methods purely based on maximum likelihood , the results are biased towards faster evolutionary phases , a bias known as the terminal - age bias @xcite .    to illustrate here the importance of using information not contained in the likelihood , we present a similar example .",
    "let us assume a star has the following observed parameters : and . for simplicity ,",
    "we exclude metallicity in this example by fixing it to [ fe / h ] @xmath75 . in the top panel of fig .",

    "first , we perform a standard maximum likelihood analysis ( hereafter , ml ) to determine the stellar mass and age based on monte - carlo sampling .",
    "we create synthetic distributions of @xmath20 and @xmath0 assuming gaussian distributions of errors and search for the best - fit model in all evolutionary tracks of the assumed metallicity . the resulting mass and age distributions",
    "are shown in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : example_bayes ] , respectively .",
    "the mass distribution shows a bimodality with a secondary peak and a tail extending towards larger masses ( @xmath76 ) . the age distribution shows a dominant peak at very low ages ( @xmath77 ) clearly seen in the inset that zooms in in this age range",
    "there are two other local maxima at about 4.3  gyr and 4.8  gyr , but with much lower relative probabilities than the solution at very low age .",
    "thus the ml results indicate a strong preference for the pms solution for the observed parameters .    while it can not be completely ruled out that the star is on the pms , considerations of the shortness of this evolutionary phase render this possibility , a priori , not very likely .",
    "a brute force way of taking this into consideration is to directly eliminate pms models from the analysis .",
    "we impose this restriction by removing all stellar models with ages @xmath78  myr . in this way , while the best - fit model is still determined purely from its ml , we are already using prior information by assuming the chance of observing a pms star is negligible ( actually null , although this also is a wrong assumption ! ) . results for this exercise",

    "[ fig : example_bayes ] . in the mass distribution",
    ", the tail at high masses vanished since its origin was purely from the pms models .",
    "the same is true for the ages : the unrealistically large peak at @xmath79 myr disappeared , and the peaks at 4.3  gyr and 4.8  gyr are now the dominant features , but their relative weight is still the same as in the pure ml analysis and the older peak , associated with stars entering the sgb still dominates .    the results of the bayesian analysis for our fiducial star are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example_bayes ] ( middle and bottom panels , solid black line ) . as in the case of the ml case ,",
    "three peaks are present but the maximum probability in each of them reflects information not contained in the ml analysis . the pms solution , although possible , is now strongly disfavoured , whereas the ms solution is now the most likely one and it outweighs the sgb solution .",
    "the bayesian mass distribution ( middle panel ) is similar to the ml no - pms case .",
    "the vanishing contribution of the pms is now easy to understand from the eq .",
    "[ eq : ageprob ] . the probability for a given mass",
    "is obtained by marginalizing the posterior pdf over all possible ages . the stellar tracks with high masses , which contribute in the observational box with the pms ,",
    "are strongly disfavoured because of the short duration of this phase .",
    "however , the pms solution still has a non - negligible probability in the age distribution .",
    "the widths of the peaks reflect evolutionary speed in each phase , with pms evolution being about @xmath80 times faster than late ms evolution and early sgb a few times faster than late ms .",
    "there is one important aspect related to the interpetation of the height of the peaks in the bayesian age pdf . strictly speaking ,",
    "when determining the probability of a given age @xmath81 using equation  [ eq : ageprob ] , there is no information on the speed of stellar evolution because we are looking at a time snapshot .",
    "as stated by @xcite , the relative heights of the peaks in the age distribution are determined by how closely packed evolutionary tracks of different masses are around the observational error box ( i.e. , the region over which likelihood is significant and varies little ) . where variations in stellar mass introduce small changes on the location of a stellar model ( for the same age )",
    ", the integrand in equation  [ eq : ageprob ] will vary slowly when integrating in mass .",
    "thus , the interpretation of the height of the peaks as depending on the evolutionary speed of stars is not straightforward .",
    "it only follows if slow evolutionary speeds are associated with regions on the observational plane where small changes in mass produce small changes in the observational quantities the determine the likelihood . as stated above , the unique direct manifestation of a slowly evolving phase in the age pdf is the width of the peaks in the distribution .       band . on the left results are shown for a turn - off star and , on the right for a star on the red giant branch . in the latter case ,",

    "[ fig : pdf ] .",

    "garstec ` tracks were used in this work , whereas @xcite adopted padova isochrones .",
    "also , the approach followed in that study is esentially a nearest neighbor technique , however with the important difference that the isochrones were resampled to a uniform spacing in age to account for the variable speed of stellar evolution , and a weighing scheme to include , for example , the impact of the initial mass function . in this respect",
    ", their analysis also makes use of priors . * @xcite neglected reddening in their distance determinations .",
    "we used the reddening values following @xcite ; also comparison with the interstellar nad lines in our high - resolution spectra indicates that reddening is not negligible for many stars .",

    "the differences between @xmath27 parameters and those from the rave dr3 pipeline are shown in fig .",

    "we also show the differences @xmath27 and @xmath26 for the same stars in grey empty squares .",
    "rave dr3 parameters show a very large spread with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , the spread is much larger than with respect to the @xmath26 parameters .",
    "clearly it is not possible to single out specific factors which cause the spread ; however , some conclusions can be drawn . in most cases , the rave dr3 @xmath0 values",
    "are clearly underestimated for giants with @xmath123 up to @xmath124  dex and one case as large as 1.3  dex .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the metal - poor stars , in qualitative agreement with the differences between the @xmath27-@xmath26 parameters for the same stars .",
    "the same is true for subgiants ; in most cases the dr3 gravities are underestimated . for dwarfs , on the other hand",

    "@xcite arrive at the same conclusion comparing dr3 gravities with stellar models .    as a consequence of the differences in stellar parameters , particularly changes in @xmath0 , the distances we obtain from the @xmath27 parameters are systematically _ smaller _ than the rave dr3 data ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the most distant metal - poor giants , the offset is of the order @xmath125 percent .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : rave_vs_us_dist ] , which shows that beyond 1.5  kpc all @xmath27 distances but one are smaller than those derived in @xcite .",
    "for a few dwarfs in the immediate solar neighborhood , the results are opposite , as expected from the sign of the @xmath0 corrections .",
    "the overall trend is very clear and the qualitative similarity with the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath26 distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_abs ] ) is striking .",
    "these results provide alarming evidence that the rave dr3 stellar parameters are affected by the systematic error caused by the 1d lte assumption in spectroscopic parameter determinations .",
    "test calculations for the caii near - ir triplet using the mean 3d model atmospheres from @xcite indicate that these spectral lines are strongly affected by the @xmath126 differences , while the near - ir fe i lines are mostly affected by nlte .",

    ". the effects are clearly present irrespectively of the spectral resolution .",
    "we close this section with a few comments related to the two different validations that @xcite presented for distance determination from rave data .",
    "the first one is a comparison with hipparcos stars present in their catalogue with trigonometric errors smaller than 20% and spectroscopic distance errors smaller than 32% .",
    "these results are shown in figure  3 in @xcite and a large spread is present in the comparison . even if no systematic difference was found , as noted by the authors , almost all these stars dwarfs with a solar - like metallicity ( [ m / h]=@xmath134 ) , exactly the case where we do not expect large nlte effects .",
    "the second test consisted in comparing about 14 stars in 7 open clusters with known distances .",
    "again , all these clusters have solar - like metallicity @xcite and we do not expect nlte effects to play a central role . in any case , we note that distances derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table  2 ) for the cluster stars deviate from the cluster distances by anything between -20 to + 40% .",
    "these stars were reanalyzed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table  3 ) and results show a similar spread , although in a few cases distance determinations are also quite different from those in @xcite .",
    "it is simply not possible to try to establish confidence in spectroscopically derived parameters , particularly at low metallicities and gravities , by extrapolating confidence gained by means of tests performed in very different regimes , e.g. at solar metallicity .",
    "this paper is the second in the series where we explore the influence of different methods on the determination of basic and fundamental stellar parameters for fgkm stars .",
    "the main goal is to understand to what extent our knowledge about stars , their surface and interior structure , is biased by inferences derived from classical model atmospheres with their simplifying assumptions ( 1d hydrostatic and local thermodynamic equilibrium , lte ) , which have been used as a basis for spectroscopic characterization of stars over the past @xmath135 years .     and @xmath27 parameters .",

    "[ fig : sphere],title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    in paper 1 , we developed a novel nlte - opt technique to determine accurate effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity from a stellar spectrum and then applied the method to a large sample of stars selected from the rave survey .",
    "the principal components of the method are ( i ) the use of a robust effective temperature scale from the analysis of balmer line wings and , ( ii ) the determination of surface gravities and metallicities by solving physically - realistic nlte radiative transfer in fe lines .",
    "this avoids substantial systematic uncertainties in parameters introduced by the commonly - used approximation of lte .",
    "a comparison of the new nlte - opt stellar parameters to that obtained from the standard method of 1d lte excitation - ionization balance of fe , lte - fe , revealed important differences ranging from @xmath136 k to @xmath5 ( subgiants , rgb ) in @xmath137 , @xmath122 to @xmath14 dex in @xmath0 , and @xmath100 to @xmath15 dex in [ fe / h ] .    in this paper , we focus on the determination of evolutionary parameters of stars , masses and ages , and their distances . we develop a robust bayesian technique using state - of - the - art evolutionary tracks computed with the ` garstec ` code @xcite .",

    "test comparisons of results obtained with our bayesian scheme with other similar studies confirm its reliability and accuracy .",

    "the _ classical method _ of lte excitation - ionization balance of fe , as a rule , underestimates @xmath144 , @xmath0 , and [ fe / h ] of fgkm stars . as demonstrated in paper 1 , for the most metal - poor giants ,",

    "is skewed towards the more metal - rich domain ( by @xmath146[fe / h ] @xmath147 dex ; @xcite ) .",
    "* lte - fe stellar parameters result in overestimated distances compared to the nlte - opt results , and the bias depends on the metallicity and evolutionary stage of a star .",

    "the distances to metal - poor subgiant and turnoff stars are in error by a factor of @xmath149 .",
    "only more metal - rich turn - off stars are barely affected by this bias .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] shows the spatial heliocentric distribution of the stars in our sample determined with @xmath26 ( top panel ) and @xmath27 ( bottom panel ) parameters and makes evident the large impact of using inaccurate stellar parameters for deriving spectrophotometric distances , in particular for giants with @xmath150 .",
    "the overall distribution of distances in our sample steepens towards smaller distances as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_histo ] . as a consequence ,",

    "this is not surprising : metal lines that dominate the near - ir rave spectra are known to be strongly affected by nlte effects ( sect .",
    "[ sec : ravecomp ] ) and our test calculations with mean 3d models also show that the lines are sensitive to the @xmath151 atmospheric structure differences . as a result ,",
    "more distant stars ( predominantly metal - poor giants ) have larger dr3 distances compared to our values ( fig .",

    "+ in this respect , it is very interesting to interpret our results in the light of the findings by @xcite where the authors concluded , based on simple analytical considerations that distances for sdss / segue metal - poor stars are systematically overestimated .",
    "consistent with the arguments presented in that study , our calculations predict that the systematic error in @xmath0 and , thus , distance increases with decreasing metallicity ; [ fe / h ] is affected too , although at a lesser degree .",
    "thus , there will be two effects .",
    "first , more metal - poor stars will appear more luminous and thus more distant , which may be mis - interpreted for a very metal - poor outer stellar population .",
    "this goes in the direction of explaining why this component would appear to be more metal poor than the inner halo component .",
    "second , the systematic error in distance may propagate into the error in transverse velocity , causing the effect of a star on a retrograde orbit .",
    "this strengthens the claim by @xcite that the available observational evidence for a counter - rotating galactic halo component @xcite is weak . *",
    "masses and ages are likewise affected in a systematic way by the differences between nlte - opt and lte - fe , although there is not a one - to - one mapping of the change in mass to the change in age .",
    "in the lte - fe method , the majority of stars appear younger and slightly more massive .",
    "the difference with nlte - opt is of the order @xmath153 m@xmath154 .",
    "the ages are inaccurate by anything between @xmath8 and @xmath105 percent . in this respect",
    ", it will be interesting to re - investigate the _ age - metallicity _ relation in the solar neighborhood , which is usually drawn from stellar samples with spectroscopic metallicities and ages obtained by simple isochrone fitting .",
    "stellar parameters to estimate distances .",
    "[ fig : dist_histo],width=321 ]    we emphasize that , contrary to a wide - spread impression , departures from lte and 1d hydrostatic equilibrium will affect low- and high - resolution spectra .",
    "the reason is that these effects change equivalent widths ( or , equivalently , line indices ) , and consequently abundances inferred from a diagnostic feature .",
    "this can not be compensated by decreasing resolution of a spectrum , which merely alters the line profile shape without affecting the total energy absorbed in a line .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the accuracy of the stellar parameters ( @xmath155 , @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] ) is crucial to obtain reliable masses , ages , and spectroscopic distances for late - type stars .",
    "our findings lead to the inevitable conclusion that using the adequate @xmath20 scale and accounting for the deviations from lte and 1d hydrostatic equilibrium in stellar atmospheres is of fundamental importance if we want to achieve an accurate characterization of stellar populations .",
    "until now , most of the work in the community has gone into developing sophisticated statistical methods to extract the largest possible amount of information from large - scale stellar surveys .",
    "although these efforts are undoubtedly valuable , they will not cure the major problem affecting the final distributions of masses , ages , metallicities , distances , which arises because systematic errors in basic stellar parameters dominate .",
