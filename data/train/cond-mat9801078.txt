    "electronic properties of nanostructures can be effectively investigated by making use of the interaction between electrons and phonons .",
    "there has been done much experimental work on the response of nanostructures to nonequilibrium ballistic phonons and to surface acoustic waves , see for example refs .   and references therein .",
    "in this paper , however , we concentrate on the reverse effect , namely on the emission of acoustic phonons from a nanostructure carrying an electric current .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to investigate the spectral and spatial distribution of generated phonons as a function of the voltage across a one - dimensional ( or quasi - one - dimensional ) channel .",
    "the concrete results are obtained for the case of a channel defined in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface of a semiconductor heterostructure by means of a split - gate at negative potential .",
    "phonon emission from various nanostructures has been extensively studied ( see e.g.refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "however , we are not aware of any work on emission of acoustic phonons from a biased quantum wire .    using the landauer - bttiker - imry approach,@xcite we consider a ballistic quantum channel that connects two thermal reservoirs , each of which being in an independent equilibrium state . as was recently shown,@xcite most of the heat from a current through the channel",
    "is generated in the reservoirs.@xcite nevertheless , because of finite electron - phonon interaction inside the channel , part of the heat should be generated by the nanostructure itself via emission of phonons . in the equilibrium there is a detailed balance between the emitted and absorbed phonons .",
    "however , our situation is nonequilibrium , as the distributions of electrons penetrating into a biased quantum channel from the leads are characterized by different chemical potentials .",
    "therefore the phonon emission prevails over the absorption . such phonon emission results in nothing else than the aforementioned generation of heat inside a ballistic nanostructure .",
    "it is a complicated problem to calculate the electron - phonon coupling constant for a realistic nanostructure because of position - dependent screening ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ secnonuniform ] ) .",
    "we do not attempt here to solve it and assume the coupling constant to be known .    in sec .",
    "[ secuniform ] we consider phonons that are generated inside a long , uniform channel .",
    "the effects of smooth edges are considered in sec .",
    "[ secnonuniform ] . as a result",
    ", one can describe the phonon emission from realistic quantum channels , which usually contain a long uniform part with smoothly increasing width near the edges .",
    "in a uniform channel , the electron states can be represented as @xmath0 where the normalization length @xmath1 is assumed as the channel length ( i.e.  the distance over which the potential drops ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively , @xmath4 is the @xmath2 component of the electron quasimomentum , and @xmath5 is the wave function of transverse quantization , the energy being @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the electron effective mass , and @xmath8 is the bottom of the @xmath9-th transverse band . to be concrete ,",
    "we consider a channel defined by a split - gate in a gaas - algaas heterostructure , and therefore assume the system to be mechanically uniform in the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "consequently , we consider bulk 3d acoustic phonons with the displacement @xmath10 .",
    "this assumption should be modified in the case of acoustically nonuniform quantum wires where confined modes can be present ( see e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "however , the main features of phonon generation remain similar .",
    "the matrix element for phonon - induced transitions is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the phonon wave vector .",

    "let us consider intraband transitions within a given subband @xmath9 .",
    "the limitation is expressed by the inequalities @xmath69 , where @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "consequently , if eq .",
    "( [ cos1 ] ) is satisfied , then phonons with frequency @xmath66 and propagation direction @xmath42 are generated provided the bias voltage exceeds the threshold given by @xmath71    let us investigate the frequency region in which phonon generation is possible at least at some angle for a given @xmath48 and @xmath49 . if @xmath72 , then the function @xmath73 ^ 2/2m$ ] varies between the value @xmath74 and zero as the angle @xmath42 goes from zero to the upper limit from eq .",
    "( [ cos1 ] ) .",
    "we may thus summarize the above inequalities by stating that phonon generation from transitions within the subband @xmath9 will take place ( for at least some propagation angles ) in the frequency range @xmath75    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the dependence of the phonon emission rate @xmath76 on the bias voltage is shown .",
    "thresholds in the bias voltage are apparent .",
    "if the voltage is further increased , new subbands will contribute to the phonon emission [ see eq .",
    "( [ vthreshold ] ) ] .",
    "consequently , the generation rate is a steplike function of the bias voltage .",
    "there will be equally high steps corresponding to intraband transitions , and a small modification from interband transitions .",
    "the typical rate ( corresponding to each step ) is @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",

    "it is seen that the character of the angular dependence is changed at the threshold .",
    "there is a sharp cutoff at the upper limiting angle corresponding to @xmath91 , see eq .",
    "( [ cos1 ] ) .",
    "this cutoff could be made more realistic ( that is , smoother ) by taking into account the scattering of electrons by a short - range impurity potential . as was shown in ref .",
    ", such a potential has the effect of a smearing of the momentum conservation law .",
    "furthermore , we have neglected the angular dependence of the coupling constant @xmath22 , which depends on the acoustic properties of the substrate .",

    "[ fig5 ] one can see the angular dependencies of the generation rate for three different values of the applied voltage .",
    "they are not quite similar to the case of intraband transitions .",
    "there is no phonon emission in the forward direction , because the matrix element @xmath104 vanishes for @xmath105 .",
    "the threshold values of voltage are shifted .",
    "furthermore , the upper limiting angle is in this case due to the condition that the initial momentum @xmath106 must be positive .",

    "the edges of the channel play a specific role .",

    "we will show that the phonons with a given frequency and propagation direction can be generated only near specific points where the local energy and quasimomentum conservation laws are met .",
    "consequently , the phonons emitted from the edges bear information about the position - dependent band gaps between the modes of transverse quantization .    consider an adiabatic quantum channel with the width depending on coordinate @xmath2 .",

    "as we are dealing with a nonuniform channel , we must take into account the effect of screening .",
    "the electrons in the wide regions of the channel are more mobile than those in the narrow regions .",
    "therefore , the screening of the electron - phonon interaction , and thus the coupling strength , will depend on the position .",
    "we may take this effect into account by multiplying the function @xmath129 in the transition amplitudes by a dimensionless factor @xmath130 .",
    "this factor , which will be less than 1 , is determined by the screening of the piezoelectric field or deformation potential field by the electrons inside the leads and the channel . in",

    "however , if the channel width is of the order of the effective bohr radius @xmath131 , then the screening inside the channel is not too strong .",
    "the screening of the effective field in realistic gated structures is far from being satisfactory understood , the more so that we are actually dealing with a nonstationary effect .",

    "<S> the generation rate of acoustic phonons of a particular frequency and direction of propagation is a steplike function of the applied bias voltage , with threshold voltages that are calculated in the paper . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted phonons have a characteristic angular distribution which changes significantly at the thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage dependence of the generation rate is shown to be sensitive to the shape of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spectral and spatial distributions of the emitted phonons bear information both on electron - phonon coupling in the vicinity of the device and on characteristics of the electron spectrum . </S>"
