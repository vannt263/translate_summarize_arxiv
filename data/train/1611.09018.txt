    "then we shall consider the following four types of rises .",

    ". we shall show that @xmath50 of these three formulas , the most interesting is the formula for @xmath48 which equals the number of paths of length @xmath7 in the plane that start and end at the origin and which stay in the first quadrant that consists only of steps of the form @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this number was first computed by kreweras in @xcite .",

    "we have not been able to find an explicit formula for @xmath49 but we shall show that we can develop a system of recursions that will allows us to compute @xmath49 .    the main tool that we will use to compute these generating functions is the homomorphism method as described in @xcite .",
    "the homomorphism method derives generating functions for various permutation statistics by applying a ring homomorphism defined on the ring of symmetric functions @xmath55 in infinitely many variables @xmath56 to simple symmetric function identities such as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the generating functions for the homogeneous and elementary symmetric functions , respectively : @xmath60    the outline of the this paper is as follows .",
    "first in section 2 , we shall briefly review the background on symmetric functions that we need . in section 3 , we shall prove ( [ risgf ] ) . in section 4",

    "in section 5 , we will compute @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 which combined with the results of section 4 will allow us to compute the generating functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "in this section , we give the necessary background on symmetric functions that will be used in our proofs .    a partition of @xmath7 is a sequence of positive integers @xmath61 such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "it is well known that @xmath75 is an algebraically independent set of generators for @xmath76 , and hence , a ring homomorphism @xmath77 on @xmath55 can be defined by simply specifying @xmath78 for all @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath79 is a partition of @xmath7 , then a @xmath65-brick tabloid of shape @xmath80 is a filling of a rectangle consisting of @xmath7 cells with bricks of sizes @xmath81 in such a way that no two bricks overlap .",

    "it follows that in the expansion @xmath110 , we need only consider partitions @xmath65 of @xmath111 of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a partition of @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath114    next our goal is to give a combinatorial interpretation to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : ris3 ] ) .",
    "first we are interested in the set of permutations @xmath115 which consists of all permutations @xmath116 such that @xmath117 for @xmath118 . one way to think of this set",
    "is that it is the set of permutations that arise from a forest @xmath119 such that the label of the right - most element in @xmath34 is less than the label of the root of @xmath35 .",
    "for example , if @xmath120 , then we are asking for labellings of the poset whose hasse diagram is pictured at the top figure [ fig : poset ] .",
    "we want to find the set of all labellings of the nodes of this poset such that when there is an arrow from a node @xmath121 to a node @xmath122 , then the label of node @xmath121 is less than label of node @xmath122 .",
    "this is equivalent to finding the set of all linear extensions of the poset .",
    "we have given an example of such a labeling on the second line of figure [ fig : poset ] and its corresponding permutation in @xmath123 in the third line of figure [ fig : poset ] .",
    "given an element of @xmath124 , we let @xmath125 that is , @xmath126 keep track of the number of rises between pairs of the form @xmath127 and @xmath128 .    we claim that @xmath129 this is easy to prove by induction .",
    "first , it easy to check that there are exactly two permutations in @xmath130 , namely , 123 and 132 so that @xmath131 as claimed .",
    "now suppose that our formula holds for @xmath132",
    ". then consider figure [ fig : rising1 ] where we have redrawn the poset so that the positions correspond to the elements in @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to see that the label of the left - most element must be one since there is a directed path from that element to any other element in the poset .",
    "there must be a rise from @xmath133 to @xmath134 so we add a label @xmath121 below that position .",
    "next consider node which has label 2 . if 2 is the label of the second element , then the label of the third element must be 3 since there is a directed path from that element to any of the other unlabeled elements in the poset at this point . in this case",
    "@xmath135 so we add a label @xmath121 below that position . if the label of the second element is @xmath136 where @xmath137 , then the label of the third element must be 2 since there is a directed path from that element to any of the other unlabeled elements in the poset at this point .",
    "we have @xmath138 ways to choose @xmath136 . in this case",
    "the pair @xmath139 is not a rise so that that we do not add a label @xmath121 below that position .",
    "thus our choices of labels for the binary shrub @xmath140 gives rise to a factor of @xmath141 in our sum .",
    "note that once we have placed the labels on @xmath140 , the remaining labels are completely free .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath142    this given , we can interpret the extra factor of @xmath143 in @xmath144 as adding a label @xmath145 on every third element except the last one . in figure",
    "[ fig : rising1 ] , we indicate this by putting such labels at the top of the diagram .",
    "we are now in a position to give a combinatorial interpretation to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : ris3 ] ) .",
    "that is , we first choose a brick tabloid @xmath146 consisting of bricks whose size is a multiple of 3 .",

    "@xmath292      one way to think of the set @xmath293 is that it is the set of permutations that arise from a forest @xmath119 such that the root elements are increasing from left to right .",
    "for example , if @xmath120 , then we are asking for labellings of the poset whose hasse diagram is pictured at the top figure [ fig : posetb ] where , when there is an arrow from a node @xmath121 to a node @xmath122 , then the label of node @xmath121 to be less than label of node @xmath122 .",
    "we have given an example of such a labeling on the second line of figure [ fig : posetb ] and its corresponding permutation in @xmath123 in the third line of figure [ fig : posetb ] .",
    "thus we can think of @xmath293 as the set of linear extensions of the poset whose hasse diagram is of the form pictured in figure [ fig : posetb ] .",
    "we claim that @xmath294 this is easy to prove by induction .",

    "it is easy to see that the label of the left - most root element must be 1 since there is a directed path from that element to any other element in the poset .",
    "then we can choose the remaining two elements in @xmath140 in @xmath297 ways and we have two ways to order the leaves of @xmath140 .",
    "thus we have @xmath298 ways to pick @xmath140 .",
    "once we have picked the labels of @xmath140 , the remaining labels for @xmath22 are completely free . thus if follows that @xmath299    thus by theorem [ thm : gen ] , @xmath300    we can use this generating function to compute the initial terms of the sequence + @xmath301 .",
    "@xmath302    it follows from the generating function @xmath303 that @xmath304 in fact this is easy to see directly .",
    "suppose that we are given a permutation @xmath305 .",
