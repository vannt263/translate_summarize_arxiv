    "<S> thus we focus in the doping region identified by @xmath10 ev ( the energy - zero being at the dirac point ) .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the electron - phonon coupling parameter and the electron - phonon coupling contribution to the electron self - energy in doped graphene . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we give an explicit demonstration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 in ref . @xcite . from the electron self - energy we obtain the spectral - weight function and the arpes spectra . </S>",
