    "the discrete formulation of gravity proposed by t.  regge in 1961 @xcite has been deployed in a wide variety of settings , from probing the foundations of gravity and the quantum realm @xcite to numerical studies of classical gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "regge calculus continues to be used in new and diverse ways ; recent examples include ricci flow @xcite and as an explanation of dark energy @xcite .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the regge calculus model of the vacuum kasner cosmology first considered by lewis @xcite , with the goal of gaining insight into the continuum limit of this discrete approach to gravity . in a general setting the structural differences between a continuous manifold and a discrete simplicial lattice lead to difficulties in directly comparing the regge and einstein equations or their solutions , with a single regge equation per edge in the lattice compared with ten einstein equations per event in spacetime .",
    "we expect many more simplicial equations than einstein equations in a general simulation , and some form of averaging must be expected before the equations ( or their solutions ) can be compared .",
    "lewis @xcite studied both the kasner and spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmologies using a regular hypercubic lattice .",
    "we only consider the kasner solution in this paper , where the high degree of symmetry , without the added complication of matter , allows explicit examination of the regge equations in the continuum limit . by aligning the degrees of freedom of the lattice with the continuum metric components ,",
    "lewis was able to avoid the issue of averaging and make direct comparisons between the regge equations and the kasner - einstein equations in the continuum limit .",
    "unfortunately , lewis was only able to recover one of the four einstein equations in this limit , and even this was only possible after the equations were carefully averaged @xcite . without this averaging",
    "it is not clear that the equations obtained by lewis actually represent the kasner cosmology .",
    "we show that lewis neglected a vital portion of the simplicial curvature arising from the two - dimensional spacelike lattice faces that lie on constant time hypersurfaces .",
    "the kasner cosmology has zero intrinsic curvature on constant time hypersurfaces , so the lattice curvature concentrated on spacelike faces ",
    "measured on a plane with signature `` -+ '' orthogonal to the face  make an important contribution to the total lattice curvature .",
    "we show that when these curvature terms are included , the discrete equations exactly reproduce the kasner - einstein equations in the limit of very fine triangulations without the need to average .",
    "in addition to reconsidering lewis analytic work on the spatially flat , anisotropic kasner cosmology @xcite , we construct numerical solutions to the discrete and continuous - time lattice equations .",
    "this builds on the previous work of collins and williams @xcite and brewin @xcite on highly symmetric , continuous time , closed flrw cosmologies , and the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional numerical study of the kasner cosmology by gentle @xcite with discrete time and coarse spatial resolution .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the continuum kasner solution .",
    "the kasner solution @xcite is a vacuum , homogeneous , anisotropic cosmological solution of the einstein equations with topology @xmath0 .",
    "appropriate slicing creates flat spacelike hypersurfaces , while the global topology allows non - trivial vacuum solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "the kasner metric may be written in the form @xcite @xmath1 where the functions @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are determined by the vacuum einstein equations @xmath5 note that the equation @xmath6 is a first integral of the remaining equations .",
    "the kasner metric components are @xmath7 where the kasner exponents @xmath8 are unknown constants . with",
    "this choice of metric functions the vacuum kasner - einstein equations reduce to two algebraic constraints , @xmath9 leaving a one parameter family of kasner cosmologies .",
    "the kasner solutions are the basis of the mixmaster cosmologies @xcite , which may be regarded as a series of kasner - like epochs undergoing an infinite series of `` bounces '' from one set of kasner exponents to the next .",
    "it is conjectured that these asymptotic velocity term dominated models embody the generic approach to singularity in crunch cosmologies , and it has been shown that the bounces represent a chaotic map on the kasner exponents @xcite .",
    "we follow lewis and build a discrete approximation of the kasner spacetime using a highly symmetric lattice of rectangular prisms .",
    "the regularity of the lattice implements homogeneity , while the rectangular prisms allow a degree of anisotropy .",
    "the complete four - geometry is constructed by extruding the initial three - geometry forward in time and filling the interior with four - dimensional prisms .",
    "each flat @xmath10 hypersurface consists of a single rectangular prism with volume @xmath11 , where opposing faces are identified to give the global topology .",
    "this prism is subdivided into @xmath12 regular prisms with edge lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and where the subscript @xmath16 labels the cauchy surface at time @xmath17 .",
    "the three - geometry is joined to a similar structure at time @xmath18 , where the prisms have edge lengths @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this structure is shown in figure [ fig : block ] .",
    "time evolution of the initial surface maintains homogeneity , so within the worldtube of each prism there exists a local freely - falling inertial frame . in the coordinates of this frame",
    "the coordinates of vertex @xmath22 in figure [ fig : block ] can be written as @xmath23 and similarly , the coordinates for vertex @xmath24 ( the counterpart of @xmath22 on the next hypersurface ) are @xmath25 the spacetime interval along the time - like edge joining @xmath22 and @xmath24 is defined to be @xmath26 , and thus @xmath27 where the difference operator is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "note that the requirement that @xmath29 implies a restriction on the choice of @xmath30 for a given value of the `` resolution '' parameter @xmath31 .",
    "homogeneity guarantees that identical expressions hold for all timelike edges joining the spacelike hypersurfaces labeled @xmath17 and @xmath32 .",
    "the discrete spacetime curvature in regge calculus is manifest on the two - dimensional faces on which three - dimensional blocks hinge @xcite , and is represented by the angle deficit ( the difference from the flat space value ) measured in the plane orthogonal to the face .",
    "there are two distinct classes of two - dimensional faces , or hinges , in the lattice : timelike areas formed by evolving a spacelike edge forward to the next hypersurface , and the rectangular faces of the prisms on @xmath33 slices .",
    "the timelike trapezoids formed when the spatial edge @xmath34 is carried forward in time from the hypersurface labeled @xmath17 to @xmath32 , face @xmath35 in figure [ fig : block ] , has area @xmath36 which is real since @xmath37 . likewise , the spacelike hinge @xmath38 shown in figure [ fig : block ] , consisting of the edges @xmath34 and @xmath39 , has area @xmath40 with the other spacelike and timelike hinges defined similarly .",
    "turning now to the curvature about these faces , we note that there are four distinct three - dimensional prisms which hinge on the timelike face @xmath35 .",
    "each of these is formed by dragging one of the two - dimensional faces containing the edge @xmath41 forward in time .",
    "this includes the prisms @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the remaining two prisms hinging on @xmath35 are not shown in figure [ fig : block ] .",
    "the homogeneity of the lattice ensures that the four hyper - dihedral angles that surround the hinge @xmath35 are the same .",
    "denoting each of these angles as @xmath44 , the angle defect ( or deficit angle ) about the timelike face @xmath35 is @xmath45 which measures the deviation of the total angle from the flat - space value of @xmath46 .",
    "the hyper - dihedral angle @xmath47 is @xmath48 with analogous definitions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the hyper - dihedral angles about the remaining classes of spacelike hinge .    to measure the deficit angles about the spacelike faces ,",
    "consider the curvature @xmath51 about the hinge @xmath38 .",
    "since this hinge is spacelike , the hyper - dihedral angles are boosts in the plane with signature @xmath52 orthogonal to the hinge .",
    "the deficit angle for a spacelike hinge is @xcite @xmath53 where the summation is over all boosts @xmath54 which surround the hinge .",
    "the boost between the two three - dimensional prisms which hinge on @xmath38 , namely @xmath42 and @xmath55 , is @xmath56 and the hinge @xmath38 is surrounded by four such boosts , two identical boosts above and two below . thus the final deficit angle measured about @xmath38 is @xmath57    further details on calculating the deficit angles about a spacelike hinge are contained in a recent paper by brewin @xcite .",
    "we note that this type of hinge was not included in the calculations of lewis @xcite , leading to errors in the resulting regge equations .",
    "we return to this issue below .",
    "the vacuum regge equations take the form @xcite @xmath58 where the sum is over all triangles @xmath59 with area @xmath60 that contain the edge @xmath61 , and @xmath62 the deficit angle about triangle @xmath59 .",
    "each edge in the lattice yields a single regge equation , but the homogeneity and anisotropy of our model imply that there is one distinct equation for each of the four classes of edge in the lattice .",
    "the regge equation associated with an individual timelike edge @xmath63 involves six timelike lattice faces , and has the form @xmath64 which is the discrete counterpart of ( [ eqn : kasnert ] ) , the einstein field equation @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , the regge equation which corresponds to the single spatial edge @xmath34 involves six lattice faces : two spacelike faces with area @xmath65 , two with area @xmath66 , plus the timelike faces formed by evolving @xmath34 both forwards and backwards in time .",
    "the vacuum regge equation is @xmath67 with similar expressions for the equations arising from the spacelike edges @xmath39 and @xmath14 .    using the geometric information collected in section [ sec : lattice ]",
    "we obtain a single regge equation for each class of edge on the @xmath16th hypersurface , namely @xmath68 which correspond to the lattice edges @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the structure of the regge equations ( [ eqn : regget])-([eqn : reggez ] ) is worth considering .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : regget ] ) , associated with the timelike edge @xmath63 , involves edges on , and between , two neighbouring hypersurfaces , whereas ( [ eqn : reggex])-([eqn : reggez ] ) involve information on and between three consecutive spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "thus ( [ eqn : regget ] ) is a first - order constraint , while ( [ eqn : reggex])-([eqn : reggez ] ) are second - order difference equations .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the equations derived by lewis @xcite , who neglected the curvature associated with spacelike hinges , and was thus unable to derive the spatial equations ( [ eqn : reggex])-([eqn : reggez ] ) .",
    "after correctly obtaining ( [ eqn : regget ] ) , lewis found that he could only make sense of the truncated spatial equations by considering a careful average .",
    "this averaging resulted , once again , in the timelike equation ( [ eqn : regget ] ) . without the spatial curvature terms @xmath73 , @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath51 lewis was unable to build the second - order regge equations ( [ eqn : reggex])-([eqn : reggez ] ) .    before examining the continuum limit of the regge model we consider solutions of the discrete equations .",
    "initial data is constructed at @xmath75 to match the continuum kasner solution as far as possible .",
    "taking the exact initial data to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , we mimic the properties of the exact solution in the lattice by setting @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an unknown parameter . this form is chosen to maintain the continuum condition @xmath83 to first order , which is physically equivalent to using the degrees of freedom in the initial data to generate linear expansion in the volume element . with these initial data",
    "the regge constraint ( [ eqn : regget ] ) is solved for the single parameter @xmath82 .",
    "a typical solution of the discrete regge equations is shown in figure [ fig : discrete_solutions ] for the case @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the solution to the initial value problem in this case is @xmath86 , which represents a roughly @xmath87 change in the initial rate of change of @xmath34 compared to the exact estimate .",
    "the evolution of the initial data is shown in figure [ fig : discrete_solutions]a , while [ fig : discrete_solutions]b shows the evolution of the fractional error in the regge solutions compared with their exact counterparts .",
    "the fractional error in all edges remains in the @xmath88 range , and can be shown to shrink as the time step is reduced .",
    "the residual error in the first - order regge constraint ( [ eqn : regget ] ) is defined as @xmath89 and is a measure of the consistency amongst the regge equations .",
    "figure [ fig : discrete_solutions]c shows @xmath90 as a function of time with @xmath91 , and clearly the residual @xmath90 remains small throughout the evolution .",
    "we repeated this process with different @xmath92 to estimate the rate at which @xmath90 reduces as @xmath92 tends to zero .",
    "figure [ fig : discrete_solutions]d shows second - order convergence in the mean value of @xmath90 over @xmath93 as the timestep is reduced .",
    "we explore the issue of convergence in more detail in the following sections .",
    "many of the early applications of regge calculus to highly symmetric spacetimes considered the differential equations that arise in the limit of continuous time and discrete space @xcite . in this section",
    "we derive the continuous time regge equations and compare them with the results of lewis @xcite before considering numerical solutions .",
    "the continuous - time regge model is developed from the discrete equations in section [ sec : regge ] in the limit of small @xmath92 , with the assumption that spatial edges in the lattice approach continuous functions of time .",
    "for example , the spacelike edge @xmath34 is viewed as the value of a continuous function @xmath94 evaluated at @xmath95 .",

    "these are shown above to be second order accurate approximations of the einstein equations in both space and time .",
    "we expect from ( [ eqn : reggecontt ] ) that the leading order error in the regge constraint is first order in @xmath92 . however , the coefficient of that error term is a linear combination of the regge equations we are solving ( to leading order ) , and thus the _ coefficient _ of @xmath115 is itself zero to second order in @xmath92 .",

    "the averaging process was chosen to obtain the first order regge equation ( [ eqn : regget ] ) , but lewis was still unable to derive the remaining spatial equations ( [ eqn : reggex])-([eqn : reggez ] ) .",

    ", these simulations did not enforce the homogeneity and anisotropy of the kasner model throughout the evolution , yet displayed second - order convergence to the continuum solution .",
    "these numerical simulations considered the convergence of solutions , rather than equations , and so are complementary to our analysis",
    ".    in general applications of regge calculus that utilize a simplicial lattice there will be many more regge equations ( one per lattice edge ) than einstein equations ( 10 per spacetime event ) .",
    "the direct comparison between individual regge and continuum equations considered in this paper would not be possible , or even desirable .",
    "we expect that an appropriate average of the regge equations would still correspond to the einstein equations in the continuum limit @xcite , and several such averaging schemes have been suggested .",
    "brewin considered a finite - element integration of the weak - field einstein equations over a simplicial lattice ( discussed in @xcite ) , and suggested that the vertex - based equivalent of the vacuum einstein equations are @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a vector oriented along edge @xmath61 in a coordinate system based at vertex @xmath121 .",
    "the outer summation is over all triangles which meet at @xmath121 , and the inner sum is over the edges on each triangle .",
