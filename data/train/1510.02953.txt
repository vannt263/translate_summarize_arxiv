    "the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) lagrangian shares the symmetries of the lagrangian of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) . since symmetries are nowadays considered as the most important properties of a lagrangian , it has been used for many studies of ground - state properties of strongly interaction matter at zero temperature , as well as at finite temperatures and finite chemical potentials .",
    "this includes the studies of the hadron - parton transition and of the color - flavor locking .",
    "it has also been used very successfully in the past to study meson and baryon properties as functions of the temperature and of the baryon density like hadron masses , widths and decay constants .",
    "the njl lagrangian contains quark fields but no gluon fields .",
    "the quarks interact by a four - point interaction .",
    "recently the standard njl lagrangian has been extended to the polyakov njl ( pnjl ) which includes gluons on a mean - field level  @xcite .    having a four - fermion interaction the ( p)njl lagrangian is not renormalizable .",
    "it does also not confine the quarks into colorless objects .",
    "therefore it is a challenge to describe the transition of a plasma of quarks and antiquarks to hadrons with such an approach .",
    "usually the calculations using the ( p)njl lagrangian have been performed at the mean - field level .",
    "going calculationally beyond the mean field by including systematically the fluctuations , the meson contribution to the equation of state could be identified  @xcite .    in these short proceedings",
    "we can not cover all these developments and therefore , we refer to the recent reviews for details  @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the steps which are necessary to develop a transport theory from the ( p)njl lagrangian . after having introduced",
    "the lagrangian in section 2 , discuss in section 3 how this approach is extended to finite temperature and density and present the calculation of the masses of quarks , mesons and baryons at finite temperature .",
    "section 4 contains the outline of the covariant transport theory which can be built with the help of the njl lagrangian . in section 5",
    "we present first results of this transport theory in comparison with experimental data of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "section 6 , finally , concludes this lecture with a summary .",
    "the thermal properties of qcd , the theory of strong interactions , can presently only be calculated computationally ( `` lattice qcd '' ) , and this can be done exclusively for the case of grand canonical systems with zero chemical potential .",
    "this allows for the determination of the equation of state and other thermal properties , but already the thermal properties of the constituents of the theory are not precisely known . in addition , only few of the transport coefficients which can shed light on the evolution of a system out of ( but close to ) equilibrium are yet calculated on lattice - qcd with still considerable error bars .",
    "if one wants to study the dynamics of strongly interacting matter , one has therefore to rely on effective theories .",
    "one of these effective theories is the njl model based on the lagrangian ( in the su(3 ) version ) @xmath0 \\   \\ [ \\bar{\\psi}\\textcolor{blue}{_k } \\textcolor{green}{\\gamma_\\mu } \\textcolor{red}{t^{a ' } } \\textcolor{blue}{\\delta_{kl } } \\psi \\textcolor{blue}{_l } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   h \\det_{ij } \\ [ \\bar{\\psi}_i ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) \\psi_j ] - h \\det_{ij } \\ [ \\bar{\\psi}_i ( 1 + \\gamma_5 ) \\psi_j ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 are spinors of quarks of flavor @xmath2 .",
    "the second term is a four - point interaction in dirac ( green ) , color ( red ) and flavor ( blue ) spaces .",
    "this term can be related to perturbative qcd by realizing that it describes in born approximation the interaction of two quark currents mediated by a gluon whose mass is large as compared to the momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "this term is followed by the t hooft determinant which gives rise to the @xmath3 symmetry breaking .",
    "@xmath4 are the color su(3 ) gell - mann matrices with @xmath5 .",
    "the mass of the strange quarks is different from that of up and down quarks which are considered as degenerated .",
    "being an effective model of qcd the njl lagrangian respects the symmetries of the underlying theory , in particular the @xmath6 global symmetries of the massless qcd lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath7 symmetry leads to the baryon number conservation , while the chiral symmetry @xmath8 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath9 at low temperatures .",
    "the @xmath3 symmetry is broken by the axial anomaly .",
    "after performing a fierz transformation  @xcite this lagrangian can be reexpressed in a convenient way to describe the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 interactions .",
    "the @xmath13 sector of the effective theory will allow us to describe mesons .",
    "for instance , the pseudoscalar sector of the interacting lagrangian ( [ eq : lex ] ) reads ( all repeated indices are to be summed ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a coupling constant .",
    "we will take @xmath16 as a free parameter to be fixed by comparing our results with the experimental hadron spectrum .",
    "the flavor gell - mann matrices @xmath17 follow the normalization @xmath18    the fierz transformation produces diquarks as well .",
    "we detail here the lagrangian describing the scalar diquark sector @xmath19 and the one for the axial diquark sector @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are coupling constants ( related to the original @xmath23 but taken here as free parameters ) and @xmath24 represents the charge - conjugation operator .",
    "finally , we have denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 the antisymmetric and symmetric su(3 ) flavor matrices , respectively ; and by @xmath27 the antisymmetric color matrices . in particular , the presence of the latter reflects that the diquarks can not be color singlets .",
    "the ( p)njl lagrangian has several parameters which have to be fixed . in our calculation",
    "we take those of table  [ tab : param ] .    [",

    "this means that all our parameters are fixed by vacuum hadron masses and decay constants .",
    "we would like to stress , and this is the great advantage of the ( p)njl model , that no other parameters are needed to describe hadron masses at finite temperature and density , the pressure , trace anomaly and entropy density as a function of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the cross sections for scattering among quarks and antiquarks and the hadronization cross sections .",
    "finally the whole transport approach and its prediction for the observables do not need more than these parameters .",
    "to calculate the hadron properties at finite temperature , we use the imaginary time formalism with the prescription @xmath42 with @xmath40 the temperature and @xmath43 the fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath44 .    to account for the finite baryonic density we can introduce a quark chemical potential by adding to the lagrangian the term @xmath45 where @xmath46 contains the quark chemical potentials ( which can be alternatively expressed in terms of the baryon , charge , and strangeness chemical potentials , @xmath47 ) . in this work",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a vanishing chemical potential @xmath48 .    in the pnjl model an effective potential @xmath49 ,",
    "is added to the effective njl lagrangian @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is a function of the polyakov loop @xmath52 @xmath53 and its complex conjugate , which are taken to be homogeneous fields .",

    "mesons are obtained as poles of the quark - antiquark scattering amplitude in the complex - energy plane .",
    "the scattering amplitude is the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation , formally displayed in fig .",
    "[ bethes ]        @xmath70 ( where the indices refer to the quark flavor ) and which is solved in the random - phase or brueckner approximation ( which are the same for local four - point interactions ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the meson flavor channel .",
    "the kernel @xmath73 reads @xmath74 with the vertex factors containing color , flavor and spin matrices @xmath75 as well as a combinatorial factor of 2 .",
    "the dirac structure whose indices we have omitted in the bs equation can be chosen to be @xmath76 for scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : pmesons ] displays the masses of mesons and their constituent quarks as a function of the temperature for @xmath77 . we see that the quark masses ( eq .  [ mesonm ] ) are about the constituent quark masses ( @xmath78 ) at low temperature and decrease as a function of the temperature due to the melting of the quark condensate . at very large temperature",
    "they are very close to the bare mass .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons are the goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral - flavor symmetries of qcd , and are therefore little influenced by the temperature . at low temperature",
    "their masses are lower than that of the two constituent quarks , and therefore they are the thermodynamically relevant degrees of freedom . beyond the mott temperature",
    "the sum of the constituent quark masses is lower than the mass of the meson which develops a width because it may decay into its constituents .",
    "the mott temperatures of @xmath79 s and @xmath80 s are not identical but close by . beyond the mott temperature",
    "the quarks are the thermodynamically relevant quantities and a plasma of quarks and antiquarks is formed .",
    "diquarks can form together with a third quark color neutral baryons  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath81 we will consider both the octet and decuplet flavor representations of baryons .",
    "scalar diquarks ( those belonging to flavor @xmath82 representation ) and axial diquarks ( @xmath83 ) will be used to build up the baryon octet and decuplet states , respectively , according to the decomposition , @xmath84    the starting point to describe baryons is the fadeev equation  @xcite : @xmath85 where the baryon wave function is denoted by @xmath86 and it carries a quark index ( @xmath87 ) , diquark index ( @xmath88 ) , and a possible spin index @xmath89 .",
    "the kernel reads  @xcite @xmath90 with a first term which accounts for the free quark and diquark propagators ( see right panel of fig .  [",

    "we do not attempt here to justify the form of the fadeev equation ( [ eq : fadeev ] ) and we refer the reader to the original papers  @xcite to learn the rigorous derivation and to learn more details .",
    "nevertheless , we can provide a simple motivation for eq .",
    "( [ eq : fadeev ] ) : if we denote by @xmath93 the full baryon propagator , one can form a dyson equation by taking @xmath94 as the leading order approximation ( free propagation ) , and then considering @xmath95 as the elementary interaction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : motiv ] ) .        the dyson equation can be symbolically written as @xmath96 whose solution reads @xmath97 the baryon masses are now extracted as the poles of the baryon propagator , so one needs to solve @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the baryon wave function .",

    "deviations from the experimental values are smaller than 5% .",
    "this is astonishing in view of the fact that besides the parameters fixed already by the meson sector only one new parameter enters , the diquark coupling constant .",
    "we observe as well that with increasing temperature the baryon mass decreases and become finally unstable at the temperature where the lines end .",
    "we have seen that at high temperatures quarks and antiquarks are the essential degrees of freedom whereas at low energies the formation of mesons are thermodynamically preferred because the quark condensate becomes large at low temperature and hence the quarks become heavy .",
    "mesons , on the contrary , become unstable at high temperature and develop a width due to their decay into quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the question we address in this section is how a finite size system develops , when we have brought it to a high temperature where the system is characterized by the quark degrees of freedom . in order to answer this question we need a transport theory .",
    "we could start out with a hydrodynamical approach but since we are interested not in the energy and particle density but in the processes by which quarks and antiquark pairs form mesons during the expansion and how the observables fluctuate in the vicinity of the phase transition , we search for a transport theory in which the time evolution of the quarks is addressed i.e. a molecular dynamics approach .",
    "the smallness of the quark mass at high temperature requires that this approach is covariant .      the starting point for the nonrelativistic equations of motion",
    "is the time evolution equation for a function @xmath102 defined on the @xmath103-dimensional phase space : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath106 is the poisson bracket of @xmath102 and @xmath107 , defined as @xmath108 if we replace @xmath102 by either @xmath109 or @xmath110 ( which do not depend explicitly on time ) we recover the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath111 which give , for a initial condition ( @xmath112 ) , the desired trajectory of the particle in the phase space . for the later discussion it is important to note that eqs .",
    "( [ hameq ] ) are the differential equations for the trajectory in the @xmath103 dimensional phase space on which the energy @xmath113 is conserved .",
    "equation  ( [ hameq ] ) can not directly be made covariant containing the fourth component of the coordinate and of the energy - momentum 4-vector .",
    "therefore , for the relativistic equations of motions we have to go back to the poisson equations for 4-vectors @xmath114 because in a dynamical system @xmath115 and @xmath116 depend on the time evolution parameter @xmath117 , these quantities have to be taken at equal time @xmath117 .",

    "thus we need _ constraints _ to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the relativistic phase space from @xmath128 to @xmath103 .",
    "these constraints @xmath79 have to be poincar - invariant quantities .",

    "we obtain @xmath142 whereas in the second @xmath143 in both cases we have @xmath144 .",
    "these examples show the essential property of relativistic kinematics : in order to determine a trajectory in the 6n+1 dimensional phase space we have to impose constraints but these constraints are not unique .",
    "different choices of the constraints yield a different time evolution of the system .",
    "thus the time evolution in the 6n+1 dimensional phase space is not uniquely defined and other criteria like cluster separability have to be addressed .",
    "this method can be extended to a system of @xmath145 interacting particles  @xcite . in the ( p)njl approach",
    "the interaction is expressed by the change of the mass of the quarks , eq .",
    "( [ mesonm ] ) . assuming that the system is locally not far from equilibrium we calculate the local temperature of the environment in which the quark is localized . knowing the temperature we can determine the masses . after having determined the masses of all particles we use the energy constraints to calculate the trajectories . for a given initial condition and using the temperature and density dependent masses of the ( p)njl approach we can then follow the trajectories of all particles using poincar invariant kinematics .",
    "if created in heavy - ion collisions , the qgp will expand rapidly .",
    "therefore , the cross sections between the constituents become dominant over the mean - field properties of the theory . in the njl model",

    "these cross sections have the typical size of perturbative - qcd cross sections , a couple of milibarns , if we are away from the mott temperature .",

    "in summary , we have presented in this lecture the whole way from the definition of the ( p)njl lagrangian to a transport approach based on this lagrangian which can be compared with experimental data and other theories .",
    "the transport approach does not need any additional input as compared to the ( p)njl lagrangian whose parameters are fixed by vacuum values of meson masses and decay constants . for a given initial condition for the expansion of a quark - antiquark plasma , which we borrow from the phsd approach because it can presently not be calculated , in this transport approach the predictions for the observables are close to the experimental results ( and close to that obtained in the phsd approach ) .",
    "future steps will be to include baryons in the transport approach and to include the interaction between gluons , presented by the polyakov loop and the quarks , which has recently been calculated in a dyson - schwinger approach .",
    "this interaction will bring the equation of state of the p(njl ) approach close to that of recent lattice gauge calculations .",
