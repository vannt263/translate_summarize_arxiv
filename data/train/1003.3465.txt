    "multiband ground - based photometry plays a central role in a variety of forefront topics in astrophysics .",
    "examples include mapping the expansion history of the universe with type ia supernovae , determining redshifts to galaxies and clusters using photometric redshifts , monitoring the spectral evolution of gamma ray bursts , and detecting and characterizing extrasolar planets with transits .    a specific contemporary scientific objective that requires a clear understanding of system sensitivity across filter bands is using type ia supernovae to probe the history of cosmic expansion .",
    "imagine that the spectrum of supernova emission were concentrated in a narrow wavelength range , @xmath0 .",
    "observing supernovae at increasing redshift would move the center of emission into redder passbands . in order to precisely compare the luminosity distance vs.  redshift",
    ", we must clearly have a careful calibration of the _ relative _ sensitivity across the passbands of interest , with a well - understood metrology foundation . ascertaining the equation of state parameter @xmath1 of the dark energy , and searching for any variation with redshift ,",
    "will require supernova flux measurements with percent or better _ precision _ ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "the snls collaboration has assessed photometric calibration as the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in their program to measure the equation of state parameter @xmath2 of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "another opportunity for exploiting high accuracy astronomical flux measurements will arise with the launch of the gaia astrometric satellite mission , which should provide @xmath3 stars with distances accurate to better that 0.1% @xcite . providing a commensurate _ accuracy _ for",
    "photometric measurements will allow for detailed comparisons between observed stellar luminosities and model atmospheres .",
    "these ground - based photometric measurements face a number of calibration challenges .",
    "one is knowing the instrumental sensitivity as a function of wavelength .",
    "another is accounting for absorption and scattering in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the traditional methodology of photometric calibration uses some combination of ( 1 ) observations of standard sources at the same airmass as the program objects , or ( 2 ) measurements of extinction coefficients in the passbands of interest . in this approach ,",
    "the spectra of celestial sources constitute ( often implicitly ) the standard for the measurement .",
    "these spectrophotometric standards are either based on ground - based blackbody measurements made decades ago @xcite , or in the case of da white dwarfs , on theoretical model atmospheres ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "since broadband ccd photometry of celestial sources takes an integral of photon flux across a broad optical passband ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 , for example ) , it is an ill - posed problem to infer the system sensitivity function vs. wavelength from broadband photometric data alone , especially through a variable atmosphere .",
    "the determination of the effective system throughput has often been done in a piecemeal fashion , taking benchtop measurements of filter transmission , optical catalog values for reflectivity and glass transmissions , and vendor descriptions of typical detector quantum efficiency ( qe ) .",
    "the cumulative systematic errors in this procedure limit the precision that can be achieved , and this approach lacks resolution at the pixel scale . attempting to adjust passbands determined in this fashion to match observations to synthetic photometry is ambiguous : should the passbands be broadened , shifted up or down in wavelength , or should a grey multiplicative scaling be applied ?    in order to address these concerns , and to push towards an improvement in photometric precision and accuracy , @xcite advocated breaking the spectrophotometric calibration problem into two distinct measurements : 1 ) the determination of instrumental sensitivity , using laboratory - calibrated detectors as the fundamental metrology standard , and 2 ) measuring directly the optical transmission of the atmosphere .",
    "we will focus here on our implementation of a technique for measuring , _ in situ _ , the relative throughput of the entire panstarrs apparatus , relative to a calibrated photodiode .",
    "we can forgo the use of a celestial calibration _",
    "source _ in favor of a well calibrated _ detector _ as the fundamental metrology reference for astronomical photometry",
    ". national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) has calibrated silicon photodiode quantum efficiencies at the 10@xmath6 level .",
    "this is an order of magnitude more precise than any celestial spectrophotometric source , either empirical or theoretical .",
    "in fact , the primary si metrology reference for electromagnetic flux is now detector - based rather than source - based @xcite .",
    "there is ongoing progress at nist in extending both the wavelength range and accuracy of detector calibration for metrology applications .",
    "we assert that no celestial spectrophotometric source currently offers a photon spectral distribution that is known at the @xmath7 level , and the prospect of achieving this precision is one of the main attractions of the method described here .",
    "this paper presents promising initial results from an integrated measurement of the total system throughput .",
    "we use full - pupil illumination with monochromatic calibration light to measure the entire optical train of the apparatus , including the mirror , corrector optics , filter and detector .",
    "the spatial resolution is at the pixel scale , with 1 nm spectral resolution .",
    "an earlier realization of this technique , with the mosaic imager on the 4 meter blanco telescope at ctio , was described in @xcite .    the determination of and correction for variation in atmospheric transmission is a significant challenge .",
    "a companion paper @xcite describes progress in the precise determination of atmospheric transmission .",
    "we also refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of this issue .",
    "the pierre auger collaboration has implemented @xcite a comprehensive suite of atmospheric monitoring instruments for the calibration of optical transmission in atmospheric fluorescence detection of high energy cosmic rays , and we advocate taking a similar approach for optical and infrared astronomical observations .    the merits of achieving improved photometric accuracy are spelled out in @xcite , and there is considerable work under way to achieve improved accuracy and precision .",

    "@xcite discussed the merits of a satellite - based calibration source , which would provide an opportunity to determine both atmospheric transmission and apparatus throughput in the same measurement , providing the satellite could be accurately tracked by the telescope .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey has used monochromatic light to measure and monitor the spectral sensitivity function of the sdss camera when removed from the telescope @xcite .",
    "our approach uses full aperture illumination of the entire optical system rather than measuring only the camera s response .",
    "we are not currently attempting to establish an absolute calibration of the panstarrs system , in units of photons @xmath8 s@xmath9 nm@xmath9 , but rather to establish the _ relative _ system throughput across wavelength , in arbitrary units .",
    "a specific example of the importance of understanding the relative photometric zeropoints across filters is when type ia supernovae are used to map out the history of cosmic expansion .",
    "a complete understanding of the effective system passband , and the associated zeropoints , is essential .",
    "type ia supernova cosmology is one of the many science objectives planned for the panstarrs survey .",
    "a single measurement of absolute detection efficiency , at one wavelength , would suffice to place the data presented here onto an absolute flux scale .",
    "an approach to full - aperture determination of absolute detection efficiency is described by the auger collaboration in @xcite .",
    "the calibration technique described here can be used in conjunction with more traditional photometric calibration methods . using a diversity of calibration methodologies",
    "provides an opportunity to assess consistency and to quantify potential sources of systematic error .",
    "this approach is not limited to imaging instruments .",
    "spectrophotometric sensitivity functions for dispersive instruments can be acquired in a similar fashion .",
    "a specific motivation for our calibration program is the requirement of knowing the system throughput well enough to perform high confidence color determination for the panstarrs survey .",
    "as described below , this technique also allows us to monitor filter transmission curves ( to check for variation due to hygroscopic effects , for example ) , and any other changes in instrumental performance .",

    "we have implemented the calibration philosophy outlined in @xcite , which exploits the availability of well - calibrated detectors to characterize astronomical apparatus .",
    "the reader is strongly encouraged to consult that paper for a full description of the motivation of this approach , and the related formalism .",
    "our system uses the smooth and well - characterized detection efficiency of a nist - calibrated photodiode as the standard against which we calibrate the apparatus .",

    "more recent work at nist @xcite extends high precision calibration out to 1.6 @xmath14 m , with the prospect of achieving 0.01% accuracy.,width=528 ]    an overall conceptual diagram of the arrangement of the apparatus is shown in figure [ fig : system_diagram ] .",
    "we project light from a tunable laser onto the flat - field screen in the dome .",
    "this screen provides full - aperture illumination of the panstarrs telescope .",
    "we measure the flux from the screen with a calibrated photodiode .",
    "we then compare the flux detected by each pixel in the instrument to that detected by the calibrated photodiode .",
    "performing this measurement at a succession of discrete wavelengths allows us to determine full system throughput as a function of wavelength . by interspersing calibration images with equivalent exposure times taken with the laser off",
    ", we can compensate for flux from ambient light in the dome .",
    "the panstarrs system is a high etendue wide - field imaging system , designed for dedicated survey observations .",
    "the system is installed on the peak of haleakala on the island of maui in the hawaiian island chain .",
    "routine observations are conducted remotely , from the waiakoa laboratory in pukalani .",
    "we provide below a terse summary of the panstarrs survey instrumentation .",
    "further details can be obtained from the project s web site .",
    "the panstarrs optical train uses a 1.8  meter diameter @xmath15/4.4 primary mirror , and a 0.9  m secondary .",
    "the resulting converging beam then passes through two refractive correctors , a @xmath16  cm  @xmath17  cm interference filter , and a final refractive corrector that is the dewar window .",
    "the panstarrs imager @xcite comprises a total of 60 @xmath18 pixel detectors , with 10  @xmath14 m pixels that subtend 0.258  arcsec .",
    "the total field of view of the system is 3.3 degrees .",
    "the detectors are back - illuminated ccds manufactured by lincoln laboratory .",
    "the detectors are read out using a stargrasp ccd controller @xcite , with a readout time of 7 seconds for a full unbinned image .",
    "the ccds in the panstarrs camera are deep - depletion devices , 75  @xmath14 m thick , which increases the qe in the region around 1  @xmath14 m and minimizes the effect of fringing from sky lines .",
    "the instrument has a filter changing mechanism that contains 6 large - format interference filters , _",
    "g , r , i , z , y _ and _",
    "w_.    the temperature of the ccd array was -75c , for the data presented here . for the @xmath5 band , where the red edge of the passband is partially defined by the falling silicon qe curve ,",
    "the detector qe is temperature sensitive .",
    "we made explicit note of the temperature registered by the stargrasp controller for each flat - field image obtained .",
    "in the future we expect to measure the temperature dependence of the system efficiency , arising in the detectors because of this phonon - assisted photoconversion regime in silicon .",
    "the shutter for the gigapixel array is a dual - blade linear curtain shutter , that provides millisecond - accuracy timing information on actual shutter open times .",
    "this accuracy and repeatability is important for proper background subtraction if ambient light correction is substantial .",
    "our method ensures that the shutter is fully open during the interval over which we inject laser light , so even instruments with iris - type shutters could be calibrated with minimal shutter artifacts .",
    "light from the tunable laser was transported through an optical fiber to a back - illuminated flat - field screen .",
    "a photodiode with a transimpedance amplifier was used as a coarse light level monitor , and was useful for adjusting the light intensity to the desired level .",
    "the calibrated photodiode monitored the light emanating from a portion of the screen , and was fed into an integrator circuit as described in more detail below .",
    "a shutter was used to interrupt the light into the source fiber .      1 .",
    "set desired wavelength , 2 .   open camera shutter , 3 .",
    "wait 1 sec , 4 .",
    "open laser shutter , 5 .   when time or flux threshold satisfied , close laser shutter , 6 .",
    "wait 1 sec to ensure full light dose received by camera , and to obtain post - laser ambient light level in photodiode signal , 7 .",
    "close camera shutter and read out image 8 .",
    "obtain another image and photodiode series , for same camera shutter open time , with laser off , for ambient light compensation .",
    "the tunable laser was located on level 1 of the panstarrs dome .",
    "a multimode optical fiber , na=0.3 , with low oh content , with a diameter of 1.5  mm , and clad in semirigid conduit ( ceramoptic part number sma2/wf1500/1590t30/ss/20.0 m ) carried the laser light up through the telescope structure and onto an optical bench assembly that was mounted above the flat field screen .",
    "one challenge posed by the panstarrs system is that the space available in the dome is minimal . to achieve a full - pupil illumination of the telescope",
    ", we constructed a projector box that is mounted on the inner wall of the enclosure .",
    "this illuminates a transmissive flat - field screen ( obtained from the day - lite corporation ) that sends calibration light into the front of the telescope .",
    "we illuminated the rear of the flat - field screen by sending light that emerged from the fiber through the optical layout shown in figure [ fig : launchoptics ] .",
    "the panstarrs enclosure and telescope can not perform independent rotations in azimuth .",
    "the telescope is always in the plane of the enclosure slit .",
    "the calibration screen and projector box are therefore mounted `` behind '' the enclosure slit , and the elevation axis of the telescope is rotated past vertical , to 125 degrees from the horizon , to point at the screen .",
    "each unvignetted element of area @xmath19 on the flatfield screen illuminates every pixel of the imager , since the optical system maps angles at the pupil to position in the focal plane .",
    "each pixel of the imager correspondingly receives light that emanates from the everywhere on the screen , at the angle of arrival that maps onto that pixel .",
    "different regions of the focal plane receive flux from slightly different areas of the illumination screen , but as long as the screen surface brightness distribution is independent of wavelength we can reliably measure the relative spectral response of each pixel .    as long as the illumination pattern on the screen is independent of wavelength , at the 10% level , the laser illumination allows us to determine ( at the 1% level or better ) the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity of _ each _ pixel .",
    "we can correct for the nonuniform illumination in our laser dome flats in the same way illumination corrections are traditionally used to correct dome flats .",
    "we have also installed a digital micromirror array in the projection box , that can be fed with an optical fiber , and we intend to use this to quantitatively assess the effect of screen illumination non - uniformities . operating the calibration system in this fashion is the equivalent of projecting an image using a digital projector , except the light source can be either a white light source , or monochromatic light from the tunable laser .",
    "this capability was not employed for the results presented here , and so the entries in the systematic error budget due to illumination non - uniformity contain estimates , for the time being .",
    "we used an ekspla nt242 opo laser as a tunable source of monochromatic light .",
    "a 1 khz pulsed nd : yag laser at 1.064 @xmath14 m is the initial source of photons .",
    "this light passes through a pair of non - linear optical crystals that upconvert the light to @xmath10=355 nm .",
    "these uv photons are then run through an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) that splits each uv photon into a pair of photons , conserving both energy and momentum .",
    "the orientation of the opo crystal relative to the incident beam can be adjusted so as to select a specific wavelength of interest .",
    "the wavelength of the output beam can thereby be tuned over a wavelength range of 210  nm to 2.3  @xmath14 m .    from the photon pair produced , the upper or lower frequency light is selected by exploiting the fact that these two beams have orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "there is a `` degeneracy point '' in the opo system at @xmath202  @xmath21  355  nm = 710  nm where the opo power drops , but this did not pose a significant problem . for wavelengths @xmath22 410 nm the ekspla",
    "laser uses up - converted light from opo emission at 2@xmath10 , and both the output power and spectral purity are considerably less favorable .",
    "we elected in this run not to extend our measurements below 410 nm , pending the installation of a short - pass filter in the beam .",
    "although the light emitted from the ekspla nt242 opo is polarized , as the light is transmitted through the optical fiber its polarization becomes randomized .",
    "the 5 nsec ekspla nt242 opo pulses have the advantage that the coherence length of the laser light is correspondingly short , so the light on the flatfield screen shows no evidence of speckle patterns that would afflict a continuous narrowband source .",
    "the spectral breadth of the tunable light is about 0.1 nm at 400 nm and 0.5 nm at 1 @xmath14 m .",
    "the light intensity from the ekspla nt242 opo is somewhat adjustable .",
    "the nd : yag laser has a variable time delay between the flashlamp pulse and the q - switch driven dump of the laser cavity . changing this time delay varies the intensity of the light emitted by the nd : yag laser , and hence the intensity of the tuned light as well .",
    "we used a spectrograph from ocean optics ( model jaz ) to monitor the wavelength of the light being sent to the flat - field screen .",
    "we used this spectrograph in conjunction with a hg - ar line lamp module ( ocean optics hg-1 ) which constitutes our primary wavelength standard .",
    "we tuned the ekspla nt242 opo to a succession of wavelengths that corresponded to lines emitted by the arc lamp source , and we compared the line centroids for the laser light to those from the arc lamps .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab : lambda ] .",
    "the table shows the line used , the ekspla nt242 opo setting , the reported centroids for the laser and arc lamp , and the magnitude of the centroid difference .",
    "the ekspla nt242 opo wavelengths are accurate to @xmath23  0.2  nm , comparable to the intrinsic line width of the laser . the wavelength calibration of the laser is more accurate than the wavelength solution of the spectrograph , but we stress that the spectrograph was used only as a _ differential _ instrument , comparing the wavelengths of the arc lamp to that emitted by the laser .",
    "we conclude from this synthetic photometry exercise that we can expect half - percent level @xmath24 band zeropoint shifts between the center and the edge of the field , even after flat - fielding , for a given stellar type . looking across stellar types ( from o to m class stars ) we can expect systematic zeropoint differences at the percent level , between the center and the edge of the field .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , knowing the system throughput for each pixel and for each wavelength will allow us to account for these effects in detail .",
    "this suggests that pushing the photometric precision beyond the 1% level will likely require a more sophisticated flat - fielding approach , that takes full advantage of the system s measured spectral response function ( as well as a determination of atmospheric transmission ) . also , the determination of `` illumination corrections '' , by rastering a source around the focal plane and requiring consistent results , will be psed - dependent at the percent level .",
    "we are now in a position to quantitatively assess various flat - fielding schemes , such as performing a joint analysis of photometric data from all bands , that take into account the position - dependence ( and also , if needed , time - dependence ) of the system s response function .",
    "finally we note that a full - aperture calibration taken of a distant source of known radiance , even at just one wavelength , would suffice to determine the single overall multiplicative term we need to extend these measurements to an absolute calibration of the panstarrs system .",
    "this would require appropriate knowledge and correction for atmospheric transmission , but the single wavelength could be judiciously chosen ( such as @xmath25  nm , also convenient for laser diode sources ) to coincide with good detector qe as well as high and stable atmospheric transmission .",

    "the dedication and competence of the scientific and technical staff of panstarrs project were essential to the success we report here .",
    "in particular we are grateful to will burgett , robert calder , ken chambers , greg gates , tom melsheimer , jeffrey morgan , and shannon waters for their invaluable assistance .",
