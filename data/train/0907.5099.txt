    "deep x  ray extragalactic surveys constitute an extremely useful tool to detect the population of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , to investigate their time evolution , and to shed light on their triggering mechanisms . moreover , hard x  ray surveys are capable to detect all but the most absorbed ( compton thick ) agns .",

    "this anticorrelation is found to be significant in a wide range of photometric redshifts , with a similar first grade polynomial function fitting in different redshift bins .",

    "the range of c ( and x / o ) is the same in all six bins , i.e. basically independent of redshift .",

    "@xcite found that the presence of a nuclear point source could have a significant bias on concentration measurements to higher values , although the authors do not quantify it .",
    "however , the influence of the nuclear point source in the concentration indexes has been investigated in hst counterparts of chandra sources by @xcite , finding that the agn host concentration differences are truly related to differences in the host galaxy structure and not to the nuclear point - source flux contribution , quantifying the possible influence at c in @xmath810% .",
    "we have extended this analysis to ground - based data , by building several galaxy models ( elliptical , lenticular , early , intermediate and late spirals ) , convolved with an hst - like psf ( a gaussian function with fwhm@xmath360.043arcsec ) and a ground - like psf ( fwhm@xmath361.0arcsec ) representative of our data , adding in both cases different fractions of an unresolved nuclear source ( nucleus / total fraction up to 50% ) and deriving the corresponding abraham concentration indexes . even though the range of c of ground - like data shrinks considerably with respect to",
    "that observed in hst - like data , we observe that hst and ground concentration indexes are very tightly linearly correlated and , that the variation of c is dominated by the host galaxy morphology and not by the nuclear component contribution .",
    "both results suggest that the influence of this bias in the anticorrelation is small .",
    "we derive that the maximum effect of the nuclear point source on c is about 7% in hst - like models and less than 3% in ground - like ones .",
    "+ _ - seeing , apparent brightness and size .",
    "_ optically fainter objects tend to show lower concentration indexes , and this effect is enhanced with poorer seeing .",
    "in fact , this correlation is observed in our data : the apparent magnitude and logc are linearly correlated .",
    "a weak tendency that apparently smaller objects have lower concentration indexes is present in our data , affecting mainly late type galaxies . besides the observational bias effect",
    ", this tendency could be also partially intrinsic ( as in the case of the apparent brightness ) , showing that intrinsically smaller objects have lower c. in order to test if c is still a good tracer of the host galaxy morphology , we have performed an independent classification based on visual inspection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "there is a good agreement between the results derived from the combination of the concentration and asymmetry indexes and those obtained by inspection .",
    "therefore , even taking into account that apparent brightness and seeing effects play an important role , we are still confident that c is a good tracer of galaxy morphology , and that , on average , lower concentration indexes are tracing later morphological types .",
    "moreover , we performed a preliminary analysis of public hst / acs images of the egs field @xcite , obtaining the i - band optical fluxes and concentrations ; we combined the optical information with the aegis egs x  ray public data @xcite , obtaining a clear anticorrelation between the x / o ratio and c , in all four aegis x  ray energy bands .",
    "we used the millennium - ii simulations database ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) in order to perform further tests of the existence of an anticorrelation between x / o and c. the mock catalog we used , contained in the mpagalaxies database , is the table delucia2006a @xcite .",
    "we worked with more than 700000 galaxies , dividing them in the same redshift ranges as in fig .",
    "[ xo_c ] . we obtained the r - band bulge - to - total flux ratio ( b / t ) for all simulated galaxies ;",
    "this parameter is proportional to the galaxy light concentration .",
    "the x / o ratios are calculated from the catalog s x  ray bolometric luminosities and the r - band bulge fluxes .",
    "[ fig_virgo_mill ] represents the obtained relationship for more than 60000 simulated galaxies with z@xmath300.4 .",
    "a clear anticorrelation can be seen for all b / t values except for pure bulge galaxies ( i.e. with log(b / t)@xmath37 - 0.25 ) , whose real population should be very small , so we do not expect to have a significant number of these galaxies in our real sample . in the log(b / t )",
    "interval @xmath38[-1.5,-0.2 ] , where most of our objects are located , this clear anticorrelation can be confirmed , showing that less - concentrated or less bulge - dominated objects ( later hubble types ) have higher x / o@xmath39 flux ratios . finally , for galaxies with log(b / t)@xmath35 - 1.5 , we can expect to be below our x  ray detection limits .",
    "there is a significant number of outliers , mostly found below the observed anticorrelation .",
    "all these objects show properties of small , dwarf or satellite galaxies ( small maximum rotational velocitiy , reduced virial and stellar mass and hot / cold gas content , low sfr ) and low bolometric x  ray luminosities , well below 10@xmath40ergs@xmath22 , making most of them undetectable at our sensitivity thresholds . in our sample , only 3% of all x  ray emitters with optical counterparts have x  ray luminosities lower than 10@xmath40ergs@xmath22 , in the observed 0.5 - 4.5kev energy range .",
    "figure  [ fig_virgo_mill ] shows a clear difference in x  ray luminosity between the galaxies belonging to the anticorrelation sequence , and to the outliers",
    ". however , there are examples of outliers found observationally ( see section [ sec_discussion ] ) .",
    "all the tests performed , described in sections [ cubsec_bias ] and [ virgo_millennium ] , suggest that the observed anticorrelation can not be solely attributed to biases , but also to a true physical effect . deriving a possible explanation",
    "requires understanding the physical connections between the observables c and x / o .",
    "+ there is a tight correlation between the c@xmath41 concentration index ( reflecting morphologies of bulges ) and the mass of the central supermassive bh , showing that more concentrated galaxies have more massive bhs @xcite .",
    "the abraham concentration index c used in this work is not the most effective tracer of bulge morphologies ; however , all the tests performed so far suggest that c is a parameter good enough to trace the galaxy light concentration and that , on average , higher concentration indexes are tracing more concentrated objects ( or earlier morphological types ) , while lower concentration indexes are tracing later morphological types .",
    "moreover , c and c@xmath41 concentration index are monotonically correlated .",
    "we analyzed the morphology of sxds x  ray emitters with optical counterparts using galsvm @xcite .",
    "we obtained gini and moment of light ( m@xmath42 ) , finding a clear correlation between these parameters and c , indicating again that higher values of c are tracing earlier hubble types . on the other hand",
    ", there is a tight correlation between gini and m@xmath42 with c@xmath41 concentration index ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ on the other hand , the physical connections of the x / o flux ratio are not so evident , but as shown below it could be interpreted as an indicator of the eddington ratio .",
    "as already mentioned , our sample is predominantly made of nucleus / bulge dominated sources .",
    "thus we can distinguish between two possible cases : + - if the nuclear luminosity dominates that of the host galaxy , the x / o ratio can be thought as a measure of the x  ray to optical spectral index , @xmath43 . on the other hand",
    ", there is a strong correlation between the hard / soft x ",
    "ray spectral index , @xmath44 , and the eddington ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath45 has not been thoroughly studied in large samples of agn , but a linear correlation has been found between both spectral indexes in a sample comprising 22 out of 23 quasars in the complete the palomar - green x  ray sample with z@xmath270.4 and m@xmath46@xmath27 - 23 @xcite . if this last correlation holds for our sample , x / o could be tracing the eddington ratio in the large nuclear luminosity limit .",
    "+ - if the host galaxy luminosity is large when compared with the nuclear luminosity ( @xmath47 ) , the x / o ratio can be thought as a lower limit of the x  ray - to - bulge luminosity ratio , that is in turn a ( weak ) measure of the agn eddington ratio @xmath48 , assuming that the x  ray luminosity represents the nuclear luminosity and the bulge luminosity is proportional to the bulge mass ( and therefore to m@xmath49 ) .",
    "+ hence , we can guess a correlation between x / o ratio and the energy production efficiency of the agn measured by the eddington ratio . under these assumptions , the galaxy light concentration vs. x / o flux ratio relation traces the correlation between the nuclear bh mass and the eddington ratio .",
    "this result could therefore suggest that more concentrated or bulge - dominated ( early - type ) galaxies , having poor matter supply to feed the activity , have lower eddington rates than those of late - type , with larger reservoires of the material for agn feeding . +",
    "this suggested approach is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "they found that agns with large smbh ( m@xmath49@xmath373@xmath1910@xmath50m@xmath51 ) , have low x ",
    "ray luminosity and eddington rate @xmath52 1 , and conversely , that smaller smbh have higher luminosity in x  rays and eddington rate @xmath38 1 , which corresponds to a more efficient accretion rate . +",
    "our approach is also consistent with the results of @xcite , which studied the m@xmath49 and eddington rates of a sample of 135 double  peaked broad line agns .",
    "they obtained that if the separation between the line peaks decrease ( this separation is directly related with the fwhm of the line , and correlated with the m@xmath49 ) , the eddington rate increases .",
    "+ @xcite found an anticorrelation between the mass of a smbh and the infrared - to - eddington luminosity ratio , l@xmath53/l@xmath54 , for a sample of type 1 ulirgs and nearby qsos , which again could be consistent with our approach .",
    "the anticorrelation is interpreted as a link between the mass of a smbh and the rate of mass accretion onto a smbh , normalized by the agn eddington rate , which indicates that the growth of the bh is determinated by the external mass supply process , and not the agn eddington - limited mechanism , changing its mass accretion rate from super - eddington to sub - eddington .",
    "+ nevertheless , as pointed out in section [ virgo_millennium ] there are observational examples of outliers of this anticorrelation , showing that massive elliptical galaxies can have high accreting bhs , and that late - type galaxies can host weakly accreting engines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
