    "our understanding of how black holes ( bhs ) evolve inside star clusters has a long and varied history . following the classic work by @xcite",
    ", it was suggested that old ( @xmath1 ) globular clusters ( gcs ) can not retain a significant bh population up to the present day .",
    "it was argued that , due to the much higher mass of the bhs compared to typical stars , the bhs will quickly ( @xmath2 ) mass segregate to form an isolated subcluster that is dynamically decoupled from the gc . due to the small size , high density , and small number of objects in the subclusters , relaxation and strong encounters",
    "were expected to eject the majority of bhs on a timescale of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , at most a few bhs would remain in the old gcs observed in the milky way ( mw , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , it was argued that if significant numbers of bhs are present in today s gcs , a subset of them might be in accreting binary systems , and detectable as x - ray sources .",
    "however , observations of luminous x - ray sources in the mw gcs prior to 2012 suggested that _ all _ of these sources are accreting neutron stars and not bhs , consistent with the theoretical expectation at the time .",
    "this classical picture started to change with recent discoveries of bh candidates in extragalactic gcs , characterized by their super - eddington luminosities and high variability on short timescales @xcite .",
    "more recently , with the completion of the upgraded vla , surveys combining radio and x - ray data for the mw gcs detected quiescent bhs by comparing their radio and x - ray luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the mw gcs containing the detected bh candidates show large ranges in structural properties , indicating that the retention of bhs may be quite common .",
    "several recent or ongoing surveys promise much richer observational constraints on this question ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to be detectable either via electromagnetic signatures or via gravitational waves ( gw ) from bh ",
    "bh mergers , the bhs must be in binary systems with very specific ranges of properties .",
    "although dynamical interaction can enhance the production of binaries containing a bh ( bbhs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , modern simulations find that the fraction of bhs in binaries is typically low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , it has been argued that detection of just a few bh candidates in gcs indicates the existence of a much larger population of bhs that are not detectable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , recent numerical studies have found that bh ejection is not nearly as efficient as was previously thought . in these studies",
    ", it has been shown that the bh subcluster does not stay decoupled from the rest of the cluster for prolonged periods .",
    "the same interactions that eject bhs from the subcluster also cause it to expand and re - couple with the rest of the cluster , dramatically increasing the timescale for bh evaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "most recently , @xcite showed that the presence of a significant number of bhs can dramatically alter the overall dynamical evolution of gcs . through repeated cycles of core - collapse and core re - expansion , bh - dynamics acts as a significant and persistent source of energy . on the other hand",
    ", the clustered environment and high frequency of strong scattering interactions , especially involving binaries , can change the numbers and properties of bbhs that form inside clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both of these aspects intricately depend on several physical processes , many of which lack strong observational constraints .",
    "for example , the distribution of the natal kicks the bhs receive can control how many of them will be directly ejected from the gcs immediately upon formation .",
    "natal kicks also control the fraction of bhs that may retain their binary companions after sn .",
    "the high end of the stellar initial - mass function ( imf ) determines how many bhs a cluster can form .",
    "the binary fraction and binary orbital properties can alter the binary stellar evolution of a bbh ( or their progenitors ) as well as the rate at which they take part in dynamical encounters .",
    "in addition , the ratio between the bh mass and the average stellar mass , also directly set by the imf , determines the timescale for bhs to sink to the center .",
    "answers to a wide variety of questions , such as how many bhs and bbhs can a gc retain at present , how many bbhs it can form over its whole lifetime , at what rate do bhs and bbhs get ejected from the clusters , and how do the bhs affect the overall evolution of the clusters , can potentially depend on these initial assumptions .",
    "hence , we must understand the sensitivity of our models to initial conditions and assumptions that are poorly constrained by existing observations .    in this study , we vary the initial assumptions affecting the high - mass stars and bhs , that are usually considered  standard \" in theoretical studies of clusters , within their observational uncertainties . in particular ,",
    "we vary the stellar imf , the birth - kick distribution for the bhs , and the primordial binary fraction and the binary properties for massive stars . we also vary the assumed prescription for mass loss via stellar winds .",

    "we call this our `` standard '' model and denote it as s ( table  1 , 2 ) .",
    "our standard model initially has @xmath5 stars .",
    "the position and velocities of the stars are set according to a king profile with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the commonly - used imf presented in @xcite , and use the central value for each slope in the different mass ranges between @xmath7@xmath8 to assign masses to these stars . in model",
    "s we assume an initial binary fraction @xmath9 .",
    "this is realized by randomly selecting the appropriate number ( @xmath10 ) of stars , independent of their masses or positions in the cluster , and assigning binary companions to them .",
    "the mass of the secondary ( @xmath11 ) is drawn from a uniform distribution with a lower limit taken from the assumed imf , @xmath12 , and an upper limit equal to the mass of the primary ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "note that , although all initial binaries are locally hard , dynamical evolution can make them soft at a later time , either by increasing the local velocity dispersion of other stars ( typically in the core ) or by moving the binary from its initial location to where the velocity dispersion is higher ( due to mass segregation ) .",
    "such soft binaries are maintained in all our simulations until strong scattering encounters disrupt them .",
    "the initial orbital eccentricities for the binaries are drawn from a thermal distribution .",

    "we assume momentum ( @xmath21 ) conserving kicks for bhs following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "bhs formed via the direct collapse scenario do not get any natal kicks , since there is no associated explosion or mass loss .",

    "below we describe how we vary the above - mentioned initial assumptions . in each case",
    "we describe only the assumptions we change relative to the baseline model s , with all other initial conditions held constant .",
    "one source of uncertainty in setting up the initial conditions is whether the binary fraction depends on the stellar mass .",
    "we create two models , f0  and f1 , varying the fraction of high - mass stars ( @xmath23 ) that are initially in binaries ( @xmath24 ) . in models",
    "f0  and f1 , we adopt limiting initial values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ( table  1 , 2 ) .",

    "in f0  and f1 , the distributions for the mass ratios ( @xmath32 ) and the orbital properties are identical to model s.    in addition to the binary fraction in high - mass stars , the binary orbital properties can potentially affect both the formation and interaction rate of bhs in a cluster .",
    "the observed distributions of initial separations and @xmath32 for binaries may have significant uncertainties and selection biases . to understand the effects of these initial assumptions , we create a set of models where we vary the initial binary properties of the high - mass ( @xmath23 ) stars . in these models , we assume that the initial @xmath33 following the observational constraint provided in @xcite .",

    "it has been widely accepted that the neutron stars get large natal kicks when they form via core - collapse sn .",
    "however , the magnitudes of natal kicks imparted to bhs , is still a matter of debate .",
    "observational constraints come from modeling the kicks required to explain the positions and velocities of known bh x - ray binaries ( xrb ) in the mw galactic potential .",
    "detailed analysis of individual bh xrbs results in widely varying constraints on their natal kick magnitudes .",
    "instead of modeling individual systems , @xcite and @xcite have performed population synthesis using different assumptions of natal kick distributions and compared their results with the positions of the observed bhs in the mw .",
    "they have found that bhs may get large kicks , perhaps even as large as the neutron stars formed via core - collapse sn .",
    "in addition , they have not found evidence of a mass - dependent kick distribution , which would be expected for the widely used @xmath21-conserving kick prescription .",
    "recent theoretical study of core - collapse sn by @xcite also suggests that the birth kicks may not be directly correlated with the bh mass . in short",
    ", the distribution of formation kicks for bhs is largely uncertain , even at the qualitative level .",
    "in addition to the one used in s , we create models with three different natal kick distributions for the bhs .",
    "these models assume that the kick magnitudes are independent of the bh masses and @xmath22 , and are drawn from a maxellian given by @xmath38 .",

    "* and the references therein ) .",
    "of course , the number of bhs a cluster can form is directly dependent on the number of massive bh - progenitor stars it initially contains .",
    "this , in turn , is directly dependent on the stellar imf , especially the power - law slope of the imf near the high - end of stellar masses . as described earlier , our standard models use the central values for the imf slopes from @xcite .",

    "we vary @xmath44 within the quoted @xmath47 uncertainties , and create models with @xmath49 ( denoted using the string  if \" ) and @xmath50 ( denoted using the string  is \" ) in table  1 , 2 .",
    "the details of how stars lose mass to stellar winds is complicated and hard to model theoretically .",
    "most stellar evolution prescriptions instead model the mass and metallicity - dependent stellar winds by calibrating the wind - driven mass loss to catalogues of observed stars .",
    "the assumed wind prescription dramatically affects the mass of the bh progenitor at the time of sn , which in turn determines the mass of the resultant bh .",

    "[ fig : kick_comp_clusprop ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , clusters modeled with other natal kick distributions , where the bhs essentially receive much lower kicks compared to the neutron stars formed via core - collapse sn , do retain large numbers of bhs all the way through @xmath72 .",

    "the same initial cluster can evolve to a final observational state with @xmath69 and @xmath70 varying by orders of magnitude , simply because of changes in the assumed natal kick distribution for its bhs ( table  3 ) .",
    "the significant number of retained bhs can also expand the cluster closer to its tidal radius , making the cluster more prone to disruption from galactic tides .",
    "for example , with otherwise the exact same properties , at @xmath104 , clusters with relatively larger @xmath89 expand more ( e.g.  sr1zand k3r1z ) , and dissolve much earlier than @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand , with the same initial conditions , model clusters with relatively lower @xmath89 are safe from tidal disruption even at @xmath104 ( e.g. , k1r1 , k2r1 ; table  3 ) .    in general , the larger the value of @xmath89 , the lower the final total mass of the cluster .",
    "this is because higher @xmath89 expands the cluster more and a more expanded cluster loses more mass due to galactic tides .",
    "the exact amount of expansion , mass loss , and the final cluster mass also depends on the metallicity ( @xmath51 ) of the cluster , since the metallicity controls the wind - driven mass loss and the resulting mass of the bh population .",
    "higher @xmath51 leads to the formation of lower - mass bhs , and as a result the overall expansion due to bh ejections is reduced .",
    "the adopted wind prescription yields a similar effect .",
    "while the strong wind prescription leads to a higher mass loss at early times compared to the weak wind prescription , the latter leads to the formation of more massive bhs in a cluster than the former . as a result ,",

    "in this study we have explored how identical initial clusters can diverge in their evolution depending on various ill - constrained initial assumptions affecting the high - mass stars , including the high - end slope ( @xmath44 ) of the imf , the distribution of natal kicks for bhs , the binary fraction and the binary orbital properties for massive stars , and the prescriptions adopted for stellar winds .",
    "using monte carlo simulations we have studied the effects of each of these assumptions from three different perspectives : ( 1 ) how they affect the global evolution of star clusters and their final observable properties ; ( 2 ) how they affect the binary fraction of bhs and the numbers of different types of bh binaries ; and ( 3 ) how these assumptions affect the number and properties of merging bh  bh binaries that could be detected as gw sources .",
    "we find that , even when we start from the same initial cluster model , variations in these initial assumptions can alter the number of retained bhs , @xmath89 , at any given time by orders of magnitude ( e.g. , tables  3 , 4 ) .",
    "this difference in @xmath89 can then change the overall dynamical evolution of the host star cluster , dramatically altering its lifetime and , if it survives to the present , its final observable properties ( fig.s  [ fig : nbh_rcobs][fig : rv_imfspread_comp_clusprop ] ) .",

    "all primordial binaries containing bh progenitors are quickly disrupted .",
