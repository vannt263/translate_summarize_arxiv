    "the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the rigid couplings and soft parameters in susy gauge theories play a crucial role in applications . actually , all predictions of the mssm are based on solutions to these equations in leading and next - to - leading orders @xcite .",
    "typically , one has three gauge couplings , one or three yukawa couplings ( for the case of low or high @xmath0 , respectively ) and a set of soft couplings .",
    "in leading order , solutions to the rge for the gauge couplings are simple ; however , already for yukawa couplings , they are known in an analytical form only for the low @xmath0 case , where only the top coupling is left . moreover , even in this case solutions for the soft terms look rather cumbersome and difficult to explore  @xcite .    in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that solutions to the rge for the soft couplings follow from those for the rigid ones in a straightforward way .",
    "one takes the solution for the rigid coupling ( gauge or yukawa ) , substitute instead of the initial conditions their modified expressions @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the grassmannian parameters , and expand over these parameters .",
    "this gives the solution to the rges for the soft couplings .",
    "hereafter the following notation is used : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the gauge and yukawa couplings , respectively , and @xmath8 are the soft masses associated with each scalar field .",
    "this procedure , however , assumes that one knows solutions to the rge for the rigid couplings in the analytic form .",
    "for instance , in the case of the mssm in the low @xmath0 regime this allows one to get solutions for the soft couplings and masses simpler than those known in the literature  ( see  @xcite ) . at the same time , in many cases such solutions are unknown .",
    "actual examples are the mssm with high @xmath0 and nmssm .",
    "one is bound to solve the rges numerically when the number of coupled equations increases dramatically with the soft terms being included .    below",
    "we propose simple analytical formulae which give an approximate solution to the rge for yukawa couplings in an arbitrary susy theory with the accuracy of a few per cent . performing the grassmannian expansion in these approximate solutions one can get those for the soft couplings in a straightforward way . as an illustration we consider the mssm in the high @xmath0 regime .",
    "one can immediately see that approximate solutions obtained in this way possess infrared quasi - fixed points  @xcite which can be found analytically .",
    "they appear in the limit when the initial values of the yukawa couplings are much larger than those for the gauge ones .",
    "then , one can analytically trace how the initial conditions for the soft terms disappear from their solutions in the above   mentioned limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we consider the mssm in the low @xmath0 regime , where all solutions are known analytically and describe briefly the grassmannian expansion . in sect .",
    "3 , we present our approximate solutions for the yukawa couplings and obtain those for the soft terms",
    ". we also present numerical illustration and compare approximate solutions with the numerical ones .",
    "the fixed point behaviour is discussed .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the explicit formulae for the soft couplings and masses are given in appendices .",
    "consider the mssm in the low @xmath0 regime .",
    "one has three gauge and one yukawa coupling .",
    "the one - loop rg equations are @xmath9 with the initial conditions : @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "their solutions are given by  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 to get solutions for the soft terms , it is enough to perform the substitution @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the initial conditions in ( [ sol ] ) and expand over @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "expanding the gauge coupling in ( [ sol ] ) up to @xmath18 one has ( hereafter we assume @xmath19 ) @xmath20 performing the same expansion for the yukawa coupling and using the relations @xmath21 one finds the well - known expression  @xcite @xmath22 to get the solution for the @xmath23 term , one has to make expansion over @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "this can be done with the help of the following relations : @xmath24 as a result one has  @xcite @xmath25\\!.\\ , \\label{si}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is much simpler than what one finds in the literature  @xcite , though coinciding with it after some cumbersome algebra .",
    "one can also write down solutions for the individual masses using the grassmannian expansion of those for the corresponding superfield propagators .",
    "for the first two generations one has @xmath26 where @xmath27 the third generation masses get a contribution from the top yukawa coupling @xmath28 where @xmath29 is related to @xmath30 ( [ si ] ) by @xmath31 \\\\   & = & \\frac{\\sigma_0-a_0 ^ 2}{1 + 6y_0f}+\\frac{(a_0-m_{1/2}6y_0(te - f))^2}{(1 + 6y_0f)^2 }   -m_{1/2}^2\\frac{6y_0}{1 + 6y_0f}t^2\\frac{de}{dt}- \\sigma_0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with analytic solutions ( [ sol],[a],[si ] ) one can analyze asymptotic and , in particular , find infrared quasi - fixed points  @xcite which correspond to @xmath32 @xmath33\\!. \\label{sf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can clearly see that the dependence on @xmath34 and @xmath35 disappears from ( [ yf])-([sf ] ) .",
    "some residual dependence on @xmath36 is left for the soft masses and partially cancels with that of @xmath29 .",
    "below we demonstrate how the same procedure works in the case of approximate solutions . as a realistic example we take the mssm in the high @xmath0 regime .",
    "the one - loop rge for the yukawa couplings in this case look like @xmath37 since the exact solution is absent and might be too cumbersome , we look for an approximate one in a simple form similar to that of ( [ sol ] ) .      in choosing approximate solutions we follow the idea of @xcite where",
    "an approximate solution for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ignoring @xmath40 has been proposed .",
    "our suggestion is to consider separate brackets for each propagator entering into the yukawa vertex .",
    "then , one has the following expressions for the yukawa couplings : @xmath41^{1/a }     [ 1 + 2by_{t0}f_t]^{1/b } [ 1 + 3cy_{t0}f_t]^{1/c } } , \\quad   \\frac 1a \\!+\\ ! \\frac 1b \\!+\\ ! \\frac 1c\\!=\\!1",

    "the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 are arbitrary and their precise values are not so important .",
    "when yukawa couplings @xmath53 are small enough , one can make expansion in each bracket , and the dependence of these coefficients disappears .",

    "it leads to an obvious modification of the formulae",
    ".    one can get also the corresponding solutions for the individual soft masses .",
    "this can be achieved either by grassmannian expansion of the corresponding brackets in ( [ y1])-([y3 ] ) , or by expressing the masses through the @xmath23s in an exact way .",

    "it is worth mentioning that for small @xmath64 ( around @xmath73 and below ) the accuracy is very good ( fractions of per cent or better ) .",

    "however , if one keeps @xmath64 in the range @xmath78 the accuracy for @xmath38 remains better than @xmath67 , and for @xmath39 and @xmath71 better than @xmath76 .",
    "the particular case considered above seems to have the worst accuracy .",
    "this is not surprising since our approximate formulae are supposed to work best of all when all three yukawa couplings are nearly equal .",
    "if we keep @xmath79 and the relative ratios less than @xmath80 , we get an average error of less than @xmath81 for @xmath38 , about @xmath81 for @xmath39 and @xmath76 for @xmath71 . this statement is illustrated in fig.[errandm ] .",
    "for each yukawa coupling we have plotted the error as a function of @xmath82 in the range @xmath83 .",
    "the ratios are kept within the region @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "further on , we narrow the range of initial values up to @xmath86 because the errors ( defined as in ( [ defer ] ) ) come to an asymptotic value for @xmath87 and almost vanish for @xmath88 . the comparison of numerical and approximated solutions is shown in fig.[evays ] for three different sets of @xmath64 s .",
    "the approximate solutions follow the numerical ones quite well , preserving their shape , and they have a high accuracy , especially in the case of equal yukawa couplings at the gut scale . however , as can be seen from the top of fig .",
    "[ evays ] , one can take arbitrary initial conditions for the yukawa couplings , in particular those which are needed to fit the @xmath89 masses , and to use our approximate solutions for these purposes .",
    "for the soft couplings , @xmath90 , we take the initial values at the gut scale to be @xmath91 and leave @xmath64s in the narrow range as above .",
    "then , we get an accuracy of @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 . for @xmath95",
    "the approximation is worse when @xmath96 is taken to be negative or smaller than @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "[ evays ] ) , but things go better for large initial values of @xmath96 and we get an accuracy of about @xmath98 . again",
    "it should be mentioned that this is an accuracy at the end point where @xmath99 itself is close to 0 and the accuracy defined as ( [ defer ] ) merely gives an odd hint of the precision . along the curves",
    "the accuracy is much better . in fig.[evays ] we have plotted the behaviour of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath99 for three different initial values of @xmath96 , namely @xmath100 and for one set of @xmath64s . as for the @xmath23 s , keeping the range of parameter space for @xmath64 and @xmath96 as above , we get an accuracy of typically @xmath101 for @xmath102 ( even better for fairly equal @xmath64s ) . for @xmath103",
    "the precision is around @xmath70 . with @xmath104",
    "we get into the same troubles as for @xmath95 .",
    "the approximation becomes good ( about @xmath76 ) only for a large enough ratio of @xmath105 .",
    "the approximation errors for @xmath90 s and @xmath23 s are linked with those for @xmath68 .",
    "if one considers only the sets of small initial values for @xmath64 ( less than @xmath73 ) , then @xmath23 s are approximated with a precision better than @xmath106 , regardless of the @xmath96 values .",
    "the precision for @xmath23 increases with @xmath96 , but this dependence is not so striking as the one on @xmath64 .    the approximate formulae for the soft masses may be derived from @xmath23 using ( [ a1])-([a7 ] ) . in this case",
    "the approximate solutions give an accuracy of about @xmath107 for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath92 for @xmath110 .",
    "for the higgs masses we get a good approximation ( of about @xmath81 on average ) for @xmath111 , and a satisfactory one for @xmath112 ( typically @xmath76 ) .",
    "this accuracy is almost insensitive to the @xmath96 variation ( we took it to be in the range @xmath113 ) and on the ratio @xmath114 ( taken to be @xmath115 ) .",
    "the slepton masses ( see fig . [ errandm ] ) are not approximated properly in an analogous way .",
    "this is mainly due to the less accurate approximation of @xmath116 .    as a concluding remark on numerical analysis",

    "the explicit expressions are presented in appendix b.    we see that the irqfp behaviour is sharply expressed for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ fpays ] ) , and our approximate solution describes the fixed point line well .",
    "the same takes place for the corresponding @xmath90s and @xmath23s . for @xmath119 and @xmath120 the accuracy is worse , however , the solution is still reliable .",
    "the soft mass terms there exhibit the same irqfp behaviour , though some residual dependence on the initial conditions is left in full analogy with the exact solutions in the low @xmath0 case .",
    "the approximate solutions allow one to calculate the irqfp analytically .",
    "one can see that the fixed points for the soft terms naturally follow from the grassmannian expansion of our approximate solutions ( [ yfp1])-([yfp3 ] ) and they inherit their stability properties , as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the behaviour of @xmath23s essentially repeats that of the yukawa couplings in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the existence of the irqfps allows one to make predictions for the soft masses without exact knowledge of the initial conditions .",
    "this property has been widely used ( see , for example , @xcite ) and though the irqfps give a slightly larger top mass when imposing @xmath121 unification , it is still possible to fit the quark masses within the error - bars and to make predictions for the higgs and sparticle spectrum @xcite .",
    "this explains general interest in the irqfps .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that the approximate solutions presented above reproduce the behaviour of the yukawa couplings with good precision in the whole integration region and for a large range of initial values .",
    "relative accuracy is typically a few per cent and is worse only at the end of the integration region mainly due to the smallness of the quantities themselves .",
    "moreover , we have shown how the approximate solutions for the soft terms and masses follow from those for the rigid couplings .",
    "this demonstrates how the grassmannian expansion , advocated in @xcite , works in the case of approximate solutions as well .    for illustration",
    "we have considered universal initial conditions for the soft terms . in recent time there appeared some interest in non - universal boundary conditions .",
    "non - universality can also be included in our formulae at the expense of changing ( [ tayl ] ) and ( [ init ] ) using the same substitution rules , see ( [ g ] ) and ( [ y ] ) .    since the form of our approximate solutions",
    "has been `` guessed '' ad hoc starting from some reasonable arguments , there is no direct way to improve them .",
    "however , one can imagine more constructive derivation of those solutions which would allow one to make corrections .",
    "needless to say that it is enough to construct a solution for the rigid terms .",
    "solutions for the soft terms will follow automatically .",
