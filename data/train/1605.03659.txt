    "the driving mechanism of collimated outflows or jets with relativistic speeds which are observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , gamma - ray bursts , and galactic microquasars is one of the major problems in astrophysics .",
    "a most widely discussed model is based on blandford - znajek ( bz ) process , the electromagnetic energy extraction from a rotating black hole ( bh ) along magnetic field lines threading it @xcite .",
    "this process produces poynting - dominated outflows , which may be collimated by the pressure of the surrounding medium such as the accretion disk and the disk wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the particles in the outflow can be gradually accelerated depending on the geometrical structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which is consistent with the recent observational implications from the radio jet in the giant elliptical galaxy m87 @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "bz process was proposed by a pioneering paper of @xcite , who found steady , axisymmetric , force - free solutions of kerr bh magnetosphere in the slow rotation limit where the outward angular momentum ( am ) and poynting fluxes are non - zero along the field lines threading the event horizon .",
    "this was followed by demonstrations of analytical and numerical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) solutions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . however , the physical mechanism how the fluxes are created in the electromagnetically - dominated plasma has not been clearly explained .",
    "in contrast , the origin of pulsar winds is identified definitely with the rotation of the matter - dominated central star .",
    "the rotation velocity of the matters of the star @xmath0 and the magnetic field threading the star @xmath1 provide the electromotive force @xmath2 on charges , maintaining the electric field @xmath3 and the poloidal electric currents ( with the toroidal magnetic field @xmath4 ) which form the outward poynting flux @xmath5 in the magnetosphere . as its feedback , the rotation of the stellar matters slows down @xcite ( see also a review in * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tt14 ) .",
    "bz process , working in the electromagnetically - dominated bh magnetosphere , does not include any matter - dominated region in which the poloidal magnetic field is anchored .",
    "one should also note that the toroidal magnetic field can not be produced in vacuum just by the rotation of the space - time @xcite .",
    "then how the electric field and currents forming the am and poynting fluxes are created and how the bh rotational energy is reduced in bz process are not simple problems and have been still matters of debate .",
    "see recent discussions in @xcite ( hereafter k09 ) and @xcite .    among the numerous calculations , the force - free numerical simulations performed by @xcite ( hereafter k04 ) are most insightful for investigating the essential points on the origin of the fluxes .",
    "tt14 extended the arguments in k04 and k09 and analytically showed that for open magnetic field lines threading the ergosphere in the steady , axisymmetric kerr bh magnetosphere , the situation of no electric potential difference with no poloidal electric current ( i.e. no outward am or poynting flux ) can not be maintained .",
    "the origin of the electric potential differences is ascribed to the ergosphere .",
    "it was also shown that for the open field lines threading _ the equatorial plane in the ergosphere _ , the poloidal currents are driven by electric field ( perpendicular to the magnetic field ) stronger than the magnetic field in the ergosphere , where the force - free condition is violated ( see also section  [ sec : equat ] below ) .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly discuss the field lines threading the event horizon .",
    "some theorists consider that the membrane paradigm @xcite is useful for effectively understanding the production mechanism of the am and poynting fluxes for such field lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this interprets the condition at the horizon as a boundary condition @xcite and the horizon as a rotating conductor which creates the potential differences and drives the electric currents in an analogy with the unipolar induction for pulsar winds explained above .",
    "however , the horizon does not actively affect its exterior , but just passively absorbs particles and waves @xcite .",
    "the condition at the horizon should be interpreted as a regularity condition ( * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanism of producing the steady am and poynting fluxes has to work outside the horizon , making the physical quantities consistent with the regularity condition .",
    "for such a causal flux production , some other theorists proposed a scenario that certain types of negative energies ( as measured in the coordinate basis , i.e. as measured at infinity ) created outside the horizon flows towards the horizon , resulting in the positive outward energy flux .",
    "this is an analogy with the mechanical penrose process , in which the rotational energy of a bh is extracted by making it absorb negative - energy particles @xcite .",
    "however , mhd simulations demonstrate that no regions of negative particle energy are seen in the steady state @xcite , although a transient inflow of negative particle energy is possible as a feedback from generation of an outward mhd wave @xcite .",
    "the role of _ negative electromagnetic energy density _ in the steady state has been discussed recently ( k09 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the concept of ` advection of the steady field ' is ambiguous .",
    "below we show that the sign of the electromagnetic energy density depends on the coordinates , and thus the negative field energy is not physically essential ( see section  [ sec : negative_em ] below ) .",
    "we argue that the causal production mechanism of the electromagnetic am and poynting fluxes can not be fully understood by investigating only the steady - state structure .",

    "the steady outward poynting flux should be interpreted just as a result of the currents flowing in the plasma with the electric potential differences .",
    "the outward poynting flux at the horizon in the ks coordinates does not violate causality , because the steady fluxes carry no information .",
    "the bh loses its rotational energy directly by this outward poynting flux without being mediated by any infalling negative - energy objects , as described in figure  [ fig : summary ] .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that our analysis is based on several assumptions ( see sections  [ subsec : magnetosphere ] , [ sec : penrose ] , and [ sec : unsteady ] ) .",
    "our arguments for the particle motions near the equatorial plane and in the toy model are required to be justified by numerical simulations . as for the electromagnetic field ,",
    "the principal assumption is @xmath80 in the steady state .",
    "it is still debated whether this condition is satisfied in the steady state at the boundary between the inflow and the outflow ( i.e. at @xmath379 in our toy model ) @xcite and even in the whole bh ( or pulsar ) magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "this issue is closely related to radiation physics , which should be resolved for validating theories on bz process by observations @xcite .",
