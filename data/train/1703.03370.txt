    "load modelling and identification are of great importance to the security and stability of power systems .",
    "while the accurate models are available for generators , transmission lines and control devices , load modeling is still a challenging and open subject due to the fact that electric load at each substation is an aggregation of numerous individual loads with different behaviors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , the poor measurements , modeling , exchange information , as well as the uncertainties in customers behaviors / devices further result in load uncertainties @xcite . indeed , load uncertainty is one of the main factors that affect the accuracy of the power dynamic models implemented by system operators over the world@xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the load uncertainty comes from both model structure and parameter values .",
    "it has been shown in previous literature @xcite-@xcite that the use of different load models leads to different and even contradictory results for dynamic stability studies . even though the applied model structure is verified ,",
    "different parameter values may also yield different damping performances in small signal stability @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "for instance , different time constants of loads may lead to either asymptotically stable system or systems experiencing oscillations ( i.e. , hopf bifurcation occurs)@xcite . both load modelling and",
    "parameter identifications are essential in studying the dynamic behaviors of power systems .",
    "this paper mainly focuses on parameter identification for a generic dynamic load model that is suitable for small signal stability analysis .",
    "different methods for dynamic load parameter identification have been proposed , which can be classified into two categories : component - based approach @xcite and measurement - based approach @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the latter approach is more commonly applied because real - time load variations and dynamic characteristics can be taken into account@xcite .",
    "measurement - based model identification is typically solved through optimization methods that minimize the error between the measured output variables and the simulated ones .",
    "in particular , the nonlinear least - square curve fitting method has been implemented in @xcite@xcite-@xcite .",
    "genetic algorithms , neural network - based methods and other heuristic techniques have been applied in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the optimization - based methods are time consuming and thus can not be implemented online@xcite .",
    "more importantly , all those methods require measurement data from dynamic behaviors of system under big disturbances ( e.g. , during faults ) , which is not always available @xcite .",
    "indeed , the variation of load parameters may be much faster than the occurrence rate of natural disturbances @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel measurement - based method for dynamic load identification in ambient conditions , which does not require the existence of large disturbance .",
    "particularly , the method combines the statistical properties extracted from pmu measurements and the inherent model knowledge , and is able to provide fairly accurate estimations for parameter values in near real - time .",
    "note that a generic dynamic load model is implemented in this paper which is suitable for the purposes of small signal stability analysis and damping performance @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the proposed method can be implemented in online security analysis to provide up - to - date dynamic load parameters accurately .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectionmodel ] introduces the power system stochastic dynamic model .",
    "particularly , the generic dynamic load model used in small signal stability is presented .",
    "section [ sectionmethod ] elaborates the proposed method for estimating parameters of dynamic loads .",
    "section [ sectioncasestudy ] presents the validation of the proposed method through numerical simulations .",
    "the impact of measurement noise is also investigated .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are given in section [ sectionconclusion ] .",
    "although we focus on load models , generator models are also incorporated to provide more realistic simulations .",
    "specifically , the classical generator model which can reasonably represent the dynamics of generator in ambient conditions is implemented .",
    "the power system buses are numbered as follows : load buses : @xmath0 , and generators : @xmath1 . particularly , to include the effects of the loads , the structure preserving model @xcite@xcite is used :    where    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a novel method to estimate parameter values of dynamic load from ambient pmu measurements .",
    "the accuracy and robustness of the method have been demonstrated through numerical studies . unlike conventional methods",
    ", the proposed technique does not require the existence of large disturbance to systems , and thus can be implemented continuously in daily operation to provide up - to - date dynamic load parameter values . in the future",
    ", we plan to further validate the method by using real pmu data and extend the method to estimate dynamic load parameters without knowing their static characteristics .",
