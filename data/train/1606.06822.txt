    "bio - functionalized nanoparticles are emerging as highly versatile platforms upon which to develop the new theranostic and tailored imaging modalities needed in the era of personalized medicine @xcite .",
    "these nanoscale agents , smaller than most subcellular structures , open the prospect of detecting and imaging a spectrum of diseases with enhanced sensitivity , and offer a means of targeting the delivery and controlled release of pharmaceutical payloads @xcite .",
    "enabling such advanced applications will require a detailed understanding of the chemical interface of a nanoparticle in vivo , configuring its complex interaction with , for instance , the extracellular matrix , disease processes , or the tumor microenvironment .",
    "magnetic resonance ( mr ) techniques are well - suited for probing bio - chemical reactions involving nanoparticles in vivo , but challenging in the limit of small concentrations , where interactions at the nanoparticle interfacial surface lead to only fractional changes in the dominant signal arising from the surrounding fluid @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in isolating signals that are derived specifically from the nanoparticle surface has led to new techniques based on hyperpolarization to enhance the sensitivity of mr spectroscopy , mostly via the use of surface - bound radicals @xcite .",
    "these techniques have been extended to dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) of liquids using both extrinsic @xcite and intrinsic @xcite nanoparticle defects . in the case of nanodiamond ( nd ) , a biocompatible nanoscale allotrope of carbon @xcite , the rich surface chemistry @xcite",
    "is ideally suited to binding small molecules such as proteins , ligands , antibodies , or therapeutics , making it a promising substrate for loading and targeted delivery applications @xcite .",

    ", we demonstrate that @xmath1h nuclear spins from liquid - state compounds including water , oil , acetic acid , and glycerol mixtures can be hyperpolarized using x - band microwaves at room temperature via contact with free - electron impurities on the surface of nanodiamond . rather than the overhauser mechanism usually seen in the polarization of liquids ,",
    "we observe a dnp frequency spectrum that is indicative of the solid - effect , in which the polarized @xmath1h spins are those that are adsorbed on the nanodiamond surface .",
    "further , by combining low field ( @xmath2 @xmath3 1 t ) spin relaxation measurements and hyperpolarization we demonstrate that it is possible to determine the extent to which the nd surface is saturated by its liquid environment . in combination with modalities based on hyperpolarized @xmath0c in the nd core @xcite ,",
    "these results are likely of use in enabling in vivo approaches to monitor the binding and release of biochemicals from the functionalized nd surface .",

    "1b . the sp@xmath6 carbon phase results in free electrons and provides a surface for liquid adsorption .",
    "we observe more sp@xmath6 hybridized carbon in smaller nds than larger nds , due to the much higher surface to volume ratio .",
    "air oxidation @xcite of the nds etches away some of the surface , removing sp@xmath6 hybridized carbon and surface electrons .",
    "much of the functionality of nd , including its fluorescence , magnetic field sensitivity , and use as an mri contrast agent stems from the presence of impurities and unbound electrons in the crystal lattice or nanoparticle surface . for dnp applications these intrinsic free - radicals provide a means of hyperpolarizing nuclear spins @xcite , but also open pathways for spin relaxation @xcite .",
    "for the smaller nds , the dominant electronic defects are carbon dangling bonds on the surface , contributing a broad spin-1/2 component in an electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectrum , ( see black trace in fig .",
    "air oxidation of the nds removes some of these surface electrons , resulting in a decrease in the broad spin-1/2 component in the spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "other components of the esr spectrum include a narrow spin-1/2 component ( yellow ) , attributed to defects in the core of the nd and a p1 center component ( green ) which results from a substitutional nitrogen atom with the electron hyperfine coupled to the @xmath13n spin .",
    "increasing the diameter of the nds shrinks the surface to volume ratio and reduces the relative amplitude of the broad and narrow spin-1/2 components . at the same time , the larger nds have more p1 centers in the core .",
    "we first examine whether the presence of these free electron spins on the diamond surface can be identified by mixing the nanoparticles with various liquids containing @xmath1h spins at @xmath14 330 mt . in this configuration ,",
    "the presence of free electrons on the nd surface enhances the spin relaxation ( with characteristic time @xmath15 ) of the surrounding @xmath1h from the liquid , as shown for the case of water in fig .",
    "1e ( and supplementary figs . 1 - 2 ) . consistent with the esr measurements , we find that this relaxivity effect is more prominent for small nds , which have a larger surface to volume ratio , and a higher number of surface spins .",
    "we note that although the relaxivity effect is small when compared to commonly used contrast agents based on metal conjugates @xcite , it is significant enough to enable @xmath15-weighted imaging when using concentrations of order 1mg / ml .",
    "turning now to a key result of the paper , we make use of room temperature hyperpolarization as a means of further probing and identifying the spins at the liquid - nanodiamond interface . in contrast to high - field hyperpolarization modalities that aim to increase the mr signal for enhanced contrast , our focus here is the spectrum of the polarization with frequency , enabling different hyperpolarization methods to be distinguished .",
    "the overhauser effect , for instance , is commonly observed when polarizing liquid compounds comprising molecules that undergo rapid translational and rotational diffusion .",
    "this mechanism relies on scalar and dipolar relaxation pathways to build up a nuclear polarization when driving at the electron larmor frequency , @xmath16 , resulting in positive or negative enhancement depending on the electron - nuclear coupling .",
    "in contrast , if the nuclear and electron spins are bound such that the primary mode of nuclear spin relaxation is via the same electrons used for polarizing @xcite , then hyperpolarization occurs via the solid - effect , cross - effect , or thermal - mixing mechanism , see fig . 2a and 2b .",

    "the fit to the data ( grey line ) is based on the esr trace linewidths for the broad and narrow spin-1/2 impurities in the nd .",
    "the hyperpolarization spectrum is consistent with that given by the solid effect .",
    "enhancement is given by the hyperpolarized signal divided by the signal with microwaves off . ]    using the naturally occurring electrons on the surface of nds , we are able to hyperpolarize the @xmath1h spins in a range of liquid - nanodiamond compounds including water , oil , acetic acid , and glycerol mixtures , despite their variation in chemical polarity . the data presented in fig .",
    "2c is representative of the effect , showing in this case @xmath1h hyperpolarization from oil ( sigma o1514 ) mixed with 25 nm nd .",
    "the data clearly exhibit the signature of hyperpolarization via the solid - effect , with a positive signal enhancement when driving at @xmath17 and a negative signal enhancement at @xmath18 .",
    "no enhancement is seen at @xmath19 = @xmath20 , as would be expected if the overhauser effect was contributing to the hyperpolarization and there is no enhancement in liquid solutions without nds .",
    "the presence of the solid - effect provides a strong indication that the signal enhancement stems from hydrogen spins that are adsorbed at the nanodiamond surface .",
    "similar behavior is observed when hyperpolarizing other liquid - nanodiamond mixtures ( see supplementary fig 3 ) .",
    "we also note that the enhancement scales inversely with nanoparticle size ( see supplementary fig 4 . ) , a further indication that dnp is mediated via spins on the nd surface and consistent with the relaxivity measurements presented in fig .",
    "we further examine the hyperpolarization spectrum as a function of magnetic field over the range @xmath2=300mt-500mt , as shown in fig 3a .",
    "the position of the enhancement peaks follow @xmath17 and @xmath18 with a peak splitting of @xmath19 = 2@xmath21 ( black dashed lines ) at low magnetic fields , ( see fig .",
    "small deviations from the predicted splitting are evident , potentially due to a contribution from the cross effect or thermal mixing mechanism . a contribution from thermal mixing and the cross effect",
    "is expected given the esr spectrum contains a broad spin-1/2 component that is wider than the nuclear larmor frequency .",
    "surprisingly , we also observe that the @xmath1h signal enhancement increases with magnetic field , as shown in fig .",
    "this dependence with field is currently not understood , given that the solid- and cross - effect enhancements are expected to scale in proportion to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively @xcite .",
    "field - dependent spin relaxation of electrons , as well as a narrowing of the esr line with increasing field , may lead however , to more efficient hyperpolarization .    .",

    "4a , the @xmath1h spins in the bulk of the liquid comprise one bath , with the other being those spins that are absorbed on the surface of the nanodiamond , in contact with free electrons .",
    "we isolate the independent contribution to the signal from each bath by comparing spin relaxation as a function of water concentration and in the presence of hyperpolarization using the pulse sequences shown in fig . 4b and 4c .",
    "consistent with the behavior expected for two spin baths , the relaxation decay exhibits a bi - exponential dependence with a short @xmath15 and long @xmath15 , as shown by the black curve in fig .",

    "f ) * summary of the @xmath1h t@xmath8 relaxation times in water - nd mixtures as a function of water concentration .",
    "we always observe a short component to the relaxation ( @xmath28ms ) and we begin to observe a long component ( @xmath29ms ) for inversion experiments once @xmath7 60 @xmath4l of water is added to the nd .",
    "data points are exponential and double exponential fits to five relaxation experiments : inversion recovery ( black ) , positive enhancement then relaxation ( red ) , negative enhancement then relaxation ( yellow ) , positive enhancement then inversion recovery ( blue ) , and negative enhancement then inversion recovery ( green ) . ]    inserting a hyperpolarization ( hp ) pulse in place of the usual inversion recovery sequence leads to a small enhancement of the signal that rapidly decays , irrespective of the concentration of water in the system .",
    "this behavior , taken together with the relaxation measurements , suggests that hyperpolarization is again limited only to those nuclear spins absorbed on the nd surface , consistent with dnp occurring via the solid - effect .",
    "further , this data puts a bound on the extent to which diffusion can transport hyperpolarized spins from the nd surface to the bulk of the liquid . since no signal enhancement is ever observed in the long - time component of the relaxation , we conclude that the hyperpolarized spins that are bound to the surface are unable to diffuse into the bulk before relaxing . in further support of this picture , fig .",
    "4f shows that relaxation ( without hyperpolarization ) , suddenly switches from a single exponential to bi - exponential decay when the amount of water exceeds 60 @xmath4l ( black dots ) .",
    "this behavior is symptomatic of any sequence that contains an inversion recovery pulse ( black , green , or blue dots ) , since the pulse acts on both the spins on the surface and those in the bulk ( see supplementary figs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "hyperpolarization without inversion recovery however , acts only on nd - surface spins and always leads to fast , single - exponential decay independent of the amount of water .",
    "a complimentary picture emerges when nanodiamond is mixed with oil .",
    "we again conclude that the system comprises two distinct baths with different spin dynamics , in this instance by examining how the signal is enhanced by hyperpolarization beyond the thermal contribution , @xmath24s = s@xmath30 - s@xmath31 , shown in red in fig .",
    "5a . in the limit of no oil ,",
    "5b shows that there is no enhancement in the signal since the electrons on the nd surface can not hyperpolarize @xmath1h spins elsewhere in the system .",
    "increasing the amount of oil has two effects .",
    "firstly , more oil leads to a steady increase in the number of spins in contact with electrons on the nd surface , thus increasing the hyperpolarized signal and @xmath24s .",
    "secondly , the additional oil in the mixture also increases the signal from spins in thermal equilibrium s@xmath31 , either at the surface or in the bulk of the liquid . to account for both the hyperpolarized and thermal contributions to the signal , fig .",
    "5b also shows the enhancement @xmath32 = @xmath24s / s@xmath31 as a function of the amount of oil ( blue ) .",
    "similar to the case of the nd - water mixture , we observe a transition in behavior around 60 @xmath4l , where the contribution from hyperpolarization begins to saturate and adding further liquid simply leads to dilution .",
    "we speculate that the liquid concentration at which this transition occurs provides information about the packing density of nd , viscosity , and extent of diffusion present in the mixture .",
    "future efforts may exploit such identifiers to signal the adsorption and desorption of nd payloads such as chemotherapeutics .    ) , the hyperpolarized nmr signal ( s@xmath33 ) , and the difference in these signal ( @xmath24s ) .",

    "solid lines are either exponential fits ( 50 nm , 75 nm and 125 nm nd ) or double exponential fits ( 18 nm and 25 nm nd ) to the data . the data has been corrected for heating effects [ see methods section ] .",
    "the polarization build up times are : 18 nm nd : @xmath34=72ms , @xmath35=4.7s ; 25nmnd : @xmath34=72ms , @xmath35=4.4s ; 50 nm nd : @xmath36=46ms ; 75nmnd : @xmath36=45ms ; 125 nm nd : @xmath36=32ms .",
    "data has been normalized such that 0 corresponds to the signal with no microwaves , and 1 corresponds to saturation of the fast component of the polarization build - up . ]    the combined data - sets for water and oil nanodiamond mixtures suggest that hydrogen spins become attached to the nd surface and remain there for times that are long compared with hyperpolarization and relaxation processes . to test this picture further , we examine lastly how the signal enhancement depends on the time over which microwaves are applied to produce hyperpolarization .",
    "the signal is observed to grow mostly between 10 and 100ms of hyperpolarization , saturating for longer times , as shown in fig .",
    "this saturation is consistent with the surface adsorbed @xmath1h spins undergoing little diffusion into the bulk liquid and thus blocking the surface from being further replenished with new , unpolarized spins . in this regime",
    ", the surface bound spins will reach a steady - state enhancement that is determined by the rates of hyperpolarization and relaxation .",
    "nanodiamonds below 50 nm in size exhibit this saturation in signal , but then undergo a slight further enhancement for hyperpolarization times longer than 1 second . this surprising behavior could be partially explained by diffusion in the oil - nd mixture that becomes enhanced for small diamonds .",
    "a further possibility is that the timescale over which @xmath1h spins remain adsorbed on the surface is reduced for nds below a certain size .",
    "the use of nanodiamond in a biological context is now widespread @xcite , given they are essentially non - toxic , exhibit a readily functionalized surface as well as attributes that enable new imaging and tracking modalities . here",
    ", we have focused on the spin interactions of the nd surface and liquid interface at room temperature , making strong use of nuclear hyperpolarization to uncover aspects of the dynamics that are otherwise challenging to observe . beyond a new means of characterization ,",
    "the use of such hyperpolarization techniques offer a means of detecting the presence or absence of adsorbed compounds , of use in targeted delivery and release of chemotherapeutics . extending this approach into the spectroscopic domain , either correlating chemical shift or relaxation times , would enable the possibility of distinguishing local environments and compounds interacting with the nd surface .",
    "given the long relaxation times and significant @xmath0c hyperpolarization that is possible with nanodiamond @xcite , the surface spin interactions investigated here open the prospect of transferring polarization from the nd - core to the surface .",
    "in this mode , intrinsic surface electrons can act to mediate polarization transfer between @xmath0c storage and @xmath1h spins for detection .",
    "such an approach is amenable to techniques based on microfluidics @xcite .    in conclusion",

    "<S> the widespread use of nanodiamond as a biomedical platform for drug - delivery , imaging , and sub - cellular tracking applications stems from their non - toxicity and unique quantum mechanical properties . here </S>",
    "<S> , we extend this functionality to the domain of magnetic resonance , by demonstrating that the intrinsic electron spins on the nanodiamond surface can be used to hyperpolarize adsorbed liquid compounds at room temperature . by combining relaxation measurements with hyperpolarization , </S>",
    "<S> spins on the surface of the nanodiamond can be distinguished from those in the bulk liquid . </S>",
    "<S> these results are likely of use in signaling the controlled release of pharmaceutical payloads . </S>"
