    "the rapid development of the theory of quantum information has revived the interest in open quantum systems in connection , on one side , to the decoherence phenomenon and , on the other side , to their capacity of generating entanglement in multi - partite systems interacting with their environments .",
    "quantum entanglement represents the physical resource in quantum information science which is indispensable for the description and performance of such tasks like teleportation , superdense coding , quantum cryptography and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore the generation , detection and manipulation of the entanglement continues to be presently a problem of intense investigation .    when two systems are immersed in an environment , then , besides and at the same time with the quantum decoherence , the environment can also generate a quantum entanglement of the two systems and therefore an additional mechanism to correlate them @xcite",
    ". in certain circumstances , the environment enhances entanglement and in others it suppresses the entanglement and the state describing the two systems becomes separable . the structure and properties of the environment may be such that not only the two systems become entangled , but also such that a certain amount of entanglement survives in the asymptotic long - time regime .",
    "the reason is that even if not directly coupled , the two systems immersed in the same environment can interact through the environment itself and it depends on how strong this indirect interaction is with respect to the quantum decoherence , whether entanglement can be generated at the beginning of the evolution and , in the case of an affirmative answer , if it can be maintained for a definite time or it survives indefinitely in time @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study , in the framework of the theory of open quantum systems based on completely positive dynamical semigroups , the dynamics of the continuous variable entanglement for a subsystem composed of two identical harmonic oscillators interacting with its environment .",
    "we are interested in discussing the correlation effect of the environment , therefore we assume that the two systems are independent , i.e. they do not interact directly .",
    "the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the quantum dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state .",
    "the organizing of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the notion of the quantum dynamical semigroup is defined using the concept of a completely positive map . then we give the general form of the kossakowski - lindblad quantum mechanical master equation describing the evolution of open quantum systems in the markovian approximation .",
    "we mention the role of complete positivity in connection with the quantum entanglement of systems interacting with an external environment . in sec .",
    "3 we write and solve the equations of motion in the heisenberg picture for two independent harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment .",
    "then , by using the peres - simon necessary and sufficient condition for separability of two - mode gaussian states @xcite , we investigate in sec .",
    "4 the dynamics of entanglement for the considered subsystem . in particular , with the help of the asymptotic covariance matrix , we determine the behaviour of the entanglement in the limit of long times . we show that for certain classes of environments the initial state evolves asymptotically to an equilibrium state which is entangled , while for other values of the parameters describing the environment , the entanglement is suppressed and the asymptotic state is separable .",
    "we analyze also the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity , which characterizes the degree of entanglement of the quantum state .",

    "@xmath14 has to preserve the von neumann conditions for all times .",
    "it follows that @xmath13 must have the following properties :    @xmath15 for @xmath16 @xmath17 i. e. @xmath18 must preserve the convex structure of @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    the time evolution @xmath23 for closed systems must be a group @xmath24 we have also @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the trace norm when @xmath27 .",

    "these mappings have a strong positivity property called complete positivity : @xmath36    in the axiomatic approach to the description of the evolution of open quantum systems @xcite , one supposes that the time evolution @xmath37 of open systems is not very different from the time evolution of closed systems .",

    "positivity property guarantees the physical consistency of evolving states of single systems , while complete positivity prevents inconsistencies in entangled composite systems and therefore the existence of entangled states makes the request of complete positivity necessary @xcite .    a bounded mapping @xmath64 which satisfies @xmath65 and @xmath66 is called dissipative .",
