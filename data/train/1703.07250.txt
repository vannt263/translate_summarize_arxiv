    "we write for the @xmath36-th mode in the asymptotic region @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the transversal coordinate ( within the surface ) and @xmath83 the longitudinal coordinate ( perpendicular to the surface ) , respectively .",

    "we start with the definition of @xmath77 in eq .   right above . using the `` translation '' operator @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the shift in the parameter @xmath4",
    ", we can write for the scattering matrix , @xmath90 for small deviations @xmath91 we can thus approximate , @xmath92 where we neglected terms of the order @xmath93 with @xmath94 . the derivation of @xmath79 as needed for the construction of @xmath78",
    "can then be expressed as follows , @xmath95 with @xmath96 , it follows for @xmath78 , @xmath97 as discussed in the main text , the gws - operator @xmath78 measures the shift in @xmath98 the wave experiences due to the scattering process .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , we define here the variable @xmath4 as a tunable _ property of the incident wave _ rather than that of the system .",
    "this means that , when , e.g. , spatially moving the scattering system , as in the case when @xmath99 , the parameter @xmath83 refers to the position of the incident wave relative to the system . moving the scattering region in the positive @xmath83-direction",
    "while keeping the incoming wavefronts unmoved thus corresponds to a variation of @xmath100 ( in analogy to active / passive transformations ) .",
    "for this case , the expectation values of @xmath101 read as follows @xmath102 where we used @xmath103 in order to emphasize that the operator of the conjugate variable is now the momentum .",
    "for the case where the system consists of @xmath104 scatterers at positions @xmath41 ( also the boundaries of the scattering region are considered as individual scatterers ) , the gws - operator @xmath105 reads as follows @xmath106 where @xmath107 stands for the partial gws - operator corresponding to the positions of the individual scatterers .",
    "the sum of all these operators @xmath107 is identical to the operator @xmath105 , and thus measures the total @xmath108-shift as discussed above [ see eq .  ] .",
    "hence , each of the summands @xmath107 measures the contribution to the total shift in @xmath108 , that can be attributed to the respective scatterer at position @xmath41 .    by analogy to eq .",
    "we now make the conjecture ( to be verified numerically below ) that the expectation value of the partial gws - operator @xmath107 can be written as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the incoming wave from the asymptotic regions .",
    "the vector @xmath111 , on the other hand , represents the local incoming wave directly impinging on the @xmath36-th scatterer and @xmath112 is the local wave emanating directly from the considered scatterer .",

    "@xmath114 are the momentum operators in the basis of incoming and outgoing waves .",
    ".   thus means , that the operator @xmath115 measures the momentum difference @xmath40 between the local incoming and outgoing waves directly at the shifted scatterer by means of the scattering matrix of the whole system . for @xmath110 being an eigenstate of the partial gws - operator , the expectation value in eq .",
    "is just the corresponding eigenvalue , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "this operator would thus provide us with a unique tool to extract information about the local scattering process by making use of information that is available in the asymptotic regions .     and @xmath117 , where the gray shaded area represents the refractive index @xmath118 .",
    "the whole system is divided into three regions : @xmath119 is the scattering matrix of the region on the left - hand side of the shifted scatterer ( indicated by the black dashed double - arrow ) and @xmath120 is the scattering matrix on the right - hand side of the shifted scatterer .",

    "[ which is the 1d version of eq .",

    "we test eq .   for many random configurations by assuming that @xmath119 , @xmath113 and @xmath120 are symmetric and unitary random matrices drawn from the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) . for the wavenumber @xmath124 and the position of the shifted scatterer we use random values .",
    "note , that shifting a scatterer only changes the free propagation length before and after the actual scattering region  a quantity which we tune explicitly in our numerics .",
    "we calculate the eigenvalues @xmath133 of the gws - operator for each configuration and compare them to the expression on the right - hand side of eq .  , for which the local amplitudes @xmath111 and @xmath131 are accessible numerically .",
    "we find excellent agreement between these two calculated quantities , i.e. , the maximal squared absolute error never exceeds @xmath135 for all 1000 system configurations studied  a deviation which is extremely small compared to the value of @xmath124 that is of the order of @xmath136 .    to show that eq .",

    "[ fig:2d_system ] in which several transverse lead modes can propagate . also here",
    "we test the numerical agreement between the left - hand side of eq .   with its right - hand side for many random configurations , in analogy to the 1d procedure described above .",
    "the difference in 2d is , however , that all scattering matrices have dimension @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the number of propagating modes . in our simulations",
    "we take @xmath119 , @xmath120 from th cue , but the scattering matrix for the middle part , @xmath113 , is obtained by an explicit numerical calculation for a single scatterer randomly placed in a 2d waveguide @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath107 through shifting this scatterer ( in propagation direction ) for each random configuration . in this way",
    "we obtain excellent agreement between the @xmath107-eigenvalues [ left - hand side of eq .  ] and",
    "the local momentum shift [ right - hand side of eq .  ] , which are independently calculated with our numerics . as in 1d , we find that the maximal squared absolute error stays below @xmath135 for all system configurations , which is again small compared to the mode wavevectors that are of the order of @xmath136 .",
    "this verifies our assumption that the gws - operator connects asymptotic quantities stored in the scattering matrix of the system with local wave amplitudes at the shifted scatterer . for reasons of simplicity",
    ", we shifted the scatteres in the 1d and 2d verification in propagation direction .",
    "however , in the derivation of @xmath78 in eq .  , no direction is distinguished from another one , such that eq",
    ".   also holds for shifting the scatterer in any other direction ( such as the transverse direction considered in the experiment ) .     and",
    "its corresponding contour lines are projected onto the plane underneath .",
    "the whole system is again divided into three regions : @xmath119 is the scattering matrix of the region on the left - hand side of the shifted scatterer ( indicated by the red dashed double - arrow ) and @xmath120 is the scattering matrix on the right - hand side of the shifted scatterer . @xmath113 describes the scattering at the shifted scatterer only . @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the global incoming and outgoing wave amplitudes from the left / right asymptotic region and the incoming / outgoing amplitudes directly at the shifted scatterer are labeled with the superscript @xmath36.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      as in our experiment , where we only have access to a subpart of the full scattering matrix @xmath1 , we use the non - hermitian gws - operator ( 4 ) based on the system s transmission matrix @xmath59 in order to find states that focus on or omit a designated scatterer .",
    "eigenstates of both , the hermitian gws - operator @xmath107 as well as the non - hermitian operator @xmath141 used in the experiment are to first order invariant with respect to a change of the position of the chosen scatterer ( up to a global factor ) .",
    "note that eigenstates of @xmath107 generally require injection from both leads , whereas eigenstates of @xmath141 are injected only from one lead .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath107 are real and correspond to the local momentum shift as shown above .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath141 , however , are complex but can still be related to the local momentum shift as we will show in the following : writing the hermitian gws - operator @xmath107 in its block structure @xmath142 we consider now the upper left @xmath143-block , which takes the explicit form @xmath144 , with @xmath59 and @xmath145 being the transmission and reflection matrix , respectively .",
    "calculating the expectation value of @xmath107 for a wave entering only from the left lead , i.e. , @xmath146 , we end up with @xmath147 , where @xmath40 is the local momentum difference . using the expression for @xmath148 ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath149 .",
    "calculating now the expectation value of @xmath143 for an eigenstate of @xmath141 ( in the following we will omit the eigenstate index for the sake of readability ) and resolving for the complex eigenvalue @xmath150 of @xmath141 yields @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the global transmittance of the eigenstate . as in the case of the wigner - smith time - delay operator , one can show that the eigenvalue can also be written in the following form @xcite @xmath153 where the real part is the derivative of the global transmitted scattering phase @xmath154 and the imaginary part can be interpreted as the change in the global output intensity with respect to a change of the local position of the @xmath36-th scatterer .",
    "it is worth noting that this relation still holds for a variation of a local parameter rather than a global one as in the case of time - delay .",
    "the reason for this is that in both the global and the local case the output vector is invariant to first order with respect to a change in a certain parameter ( e.g. , @xmath9 or @xmath41 ) . comparing eq .",
    "with now shows that the imaginary part of @xmath150 can be related to ( global ) reflections , i.e. , @xmath155 which have been omitted in the construction of @xmath141 .",
    "however , the reflection term in eq .   also features a real part which means that the real part of @xmath150 is not just given by @xmath156 .    to assign further meaning to the real part of @xmath150 , we write , in analogy to the time - delay operator , the expectation value of @xmath107 as a sum of derivatives of the scattering phases of each mode weighted with its corresponding output intensity @xcite and split the sum into two parts .",
    "one part covers the reflected waves and the other one covers the transmitted waves , respectively : @xmath157 where @xmath138 is the number of modes . for the evaluation of this expectation value with a @xmath141-eigenstate",
    ", we use the fact that the transmitted phase derivatives are the same for all modes , i.e. , @xmath158 . thus",
    ", bringing this factor in front of the sum , using @xmath159 and resolving for the real part of @xmath150 gives @xmath160 eq .",
    "shows that the real part of the @xmath141-eigenvalue , @xmath161 , contains both the momentum shift @xmath40 as well as the global reflectivity of each mode multiplied by the corresponding phase derivatives .",
    "thus , the desired correlation between a small / large @xmath162 ( or @xmath163 ) and a small / large momentum shift @xmath164 is not as obvious as for the eigenvalues of @xmath107 .",
    "we therefore investigate with our numerical approach ( see above ) , which quantity based on @xmath150 shows the strongest possible correlation with @xmath40 .",
    "testing several different expressions , we find the best results for @xmath163 and @xmath165 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_dkt2 ] ) .",
    "specifically , the probability for finding the two states ( out of ten ) with the highest / smallest values of @xmath165 among the states with the three highest / smallest @xmath163 is 99.9%/91.7% in our 2d random matrix model featuring 10 modes and 1000 random configurations .",
    "this observation allows us to relate the eigenvalues of @xmath141-eigenstates with its focusing strength even without knowledge of the reflection matrix .",
    "as we show in the next section , it is also possible to go beyond such a semi - empirical analysis by applying a special projection procedure to our @xmath141-operator , which restores a strong correlation between @xmath162 and @xmath164 itself .     versus @xmath165 for a waveguide with 10 modes .",
    "the blue circles show the distribution for all 1000 disorder configurations and the red dots correspond to a typical distribution of a single configuration .",
    "a correlation between @xmath163 and @xmath165 can clearly be observed.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    [ [ wave - expectation - values - of - q_x_i - for - singular - transmission - matrices - t ] ] wave expectation values of @xmath141 for singular transmission matrices @xmath59 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    since the construction of the non - hermitian operator @xmath141 involves the inverse of the transmission matrix @xmath59 , we have to deal with the problem that @xmath59 can become singular .",
    "this occurs , e.g. , when transmission channels are closed . as a result",
    ", a straightforward inversion of the transmission matrix fails , requiring instead the evaluation of an effective inverse by projecting the transmission matrix onto a subspace of highly transmitting channels .",
    "for the projection procedure we make use of a singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the transmission matrix @xmath166 , where the matrices @xmath167 and @xmath168 contain column - wise the left and right singular vectors and the matrix @xmath169 contains the singular values @xmath170 on its diagonal . in a next step , we pick a certain subset of large singular values @xmath171 and corresponding left and right singular vectors @xmath172 and @xmath173 . with these matrices",
    "we can construct an effective inverse @xmath174 , where @xmath175 .",
    "projecting also the derivative of @xmath59 onto this subspace , using the proper projection operators @xmath176 and @xmath177 , we arrive at the following generalized construction rule for our operator @xmath178 which turns into our original expression for @xmath141 if all transmission channels , i.e. , all singular values , are taken into account .",
    "apart from applying this procedure to non - invertible transmission matrices , it can also be used to restore a correlation between @xmath179 and @xmath164 since the projection on highly transmitting channels suppresses the reflection term in eq .",
    "and increases the global transmittance of @xmath180-eigenstates . in order to numerically verify this",
    ", we again consider many random 2d configurations as above and look at the statistical correlation between these two quantities with and without cutting away reflecting channels . to quantify the strength of this correlation",
    ", we look at the probability for finding the state with the highest / smallest @xmath164 among the states with the two highest / smallest @xmath179 . without svd",
    "these probabilities are 63.7%/79.3% , whereas the application of our procedure using the five highest transmitting states ( out of ten ) yields 95.5%/88.3% .",
    "this verifies that projecting onto highly transmitting channels provides the possibility to restore a correlation between @xmath179 and @xmath164 .      for the processing of the data measured in the experiment we fourier filter the transmission signal between the antenna array and the scanning antenna .",
    "the resulting intensity data are treated with a discrete two dimensional convolution of the form , @xmath181 with @xmath182 to generate fig .  2 and 3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath183 denotes the intensity of the measured transmission signal and @xmath184 is called the convolution kernel , which in our case takes only closely neighboring measurements ( pixels ) into account .",
    "note that @xmath185 and @xmath186 are discrete quantities corresponding to the coordinates of the grid - holes of the scanning antenna .",

    "<S> . while the frequency - insensitive principal modes are the eigenstates of the time - delay operator @xmath2 ( involving a frequency derivative ) , the class of states we introduce will be the eigenstates of a corresponding operator @xmath3 , where the parameter @xmath4 stands , e.g. , for the position of a movable scatterer . </S>",
    "<S> what is special about our new approach is that the eigenstates of @xmath5 are not only insensitive to a small change of @xmath4 , but that the associated eigenvalues indicate how strongly the corresponding conjugate quantity to @xmath4 is affected by the scattering process . </S>",
    "<S> this insight allows us to maximally focus on or maximally avoid a specific target inside multiply scattering media just based on the medium s scattering matrix @xmath1 and its variation due to a shift of the target particle that one aims to focus on .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by reviewing the principal modes remarkable property of being insensitive with respect to a change in frequency of the incident wave . the corresponding eigenvalue equation for the principal modes @xmath6 ( given as a coefficient vector in a certain basis ) and for the proper delay times @xmath7 reads as follows , @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the frequency . in a waveguide system , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] , the incident principal modes can be decomposed into waves injected from the left and right lead respectively , i.e. , @xmath10 . for a unitary scattering matrix , @xmath11 , the time - delay operator @xmath0 is hermitian with real eigenvalues @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> using the input - output relation @xmath12 , we can rewrite eq .   for a ( static ) time - delay eigenstate @xmath6 evaluated at a chosen frequency @xmath13 @xmath14 the expression on the right - hand side of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> states that the output vector of a principal mode , @xmath15 , retains its original orientation when shifting the input frequency in the vicinity of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , translates into output patterns that are invariant ( to first order ) with respect to a frequency change ( apart from a complex global factor ) . </S>",
    "<S> an aspect of the above derivation that has so far been unexploited is the fact that the derivative in eq .   does not necessarily have to be taken with respect to the frequency . </S>",
    "<S> in other words : the symbol @xmath9 can in principle represent any other parametric dependence of the scattering matrix and the stability property of the corresponding principal modes will still hold with respect to a variation of this new parameter . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we shift our attention to a whole class of generalized wigner - smith ( gws ) operators @xmath16 in which the frequency @xmath9 is replaced by the arbitrary parameter @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also expect that these gws operators may have interesting connections to earlier works where statistical properties of parametric variations of the scattering matrix have been studied @xcite .    while the eigenstates of @xmath5 are invariant with respect to a small parametric shift of @xmath4 already by construction [ as in eq .   with @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> , we still need to clarify how to interpret the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> already from the dimensions it is clear that @xmath18 must be associated with the conjugate variable to @xmath4 , in the same way as the delay time @xmath19 is the conjugate quantity to the frequency @xmath9 . to make this more evident </S>",
    "<S> we now define @xmath20 as the corresponding conjugate operator and assume that the parameter @xmath4 is global . </S>",
    "<S> it follows after a short derivation ( see supplemental material @xcite ) , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the output vector and @xmath23 denotes the expectation value evaluated in the input / output scattering state . following eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath5 is the appropriate operator to measure the shift in the conjugate variable to @xmath4 , which the wave experiences due to the scattering process  in perfect analogy to the time - delay operator measuring a shift in time , i.e. , in the conjugate quantity of the frequency @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> one specific example for such a global parameter @xmath4 could be the displacement in @xmath24-direction ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) of the entire scattering landscape from its initial position . </S>",
    "<S> the conjugate variable to the position is the momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues @xmath26 of the operator @xmath27 then measure the momentum shift ( in @xmath24-direction ) that the corresponding eigenstates experience as a result of scattering at the entire potential landscape . solving the eigenvalue problem for the operator @xmath27 thus provides us with an orthogonal and complete basis of eigenstates that are sorted by this momentum shift . to be more precise </S>",

    "<S> note that a large momentum shift requires that the wavefront of the incident eigenstate is back - scattered significantly at the target position @xmath41 , which is equivalent to focusing on the @xmath36-th scatterer . on the other hand , when the wave does not get scattered at the target at all ( e.g. , by not reaching the @xmath36-th scatterer ) , the momentum transfer will , correspondingly , be very small . in this way the gws operator @xmath39 provides us the means to focus on a designated scatterer inside a disordered medium or to omit this target simply by generating an eigenvector of the gws operator corresponding to a large or small eigenvalue , respectively .     </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to eigenstates of @xmath54 , the eigenstates of @xmath42 feature injection only from one lead , i.e. , @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted state , i.e. , the outgoing state to the right , can be calculated via @xmath65 . specifically , when adapting eq .   to feature the complex eigenvalues @xmath66 of @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> , we have for the corresponding transmitted states @xmath67 since the construction of the operator @xmath42 involves only the transmission matrix ( the reflected part is omitted ) , its complex eigenvalues @xmath68 do no longer correspond directly to the local momentum shift @xmath69 at the brass scatterer ( see details in the supplemental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do find , however , that a strong correlation between these two quantities persists ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s3 in @xcite ) , basically since the trace left in the transmission matrix by moving the target scatterer is in itself already quite indicative of the focus on this target . since this trace in the transmitted signal appears both in the phase and amplitude of a @xmath70-eigenstate as measured , respectively , by the real ( @xmath71 ) and imaginary ( @xmath72 ) parts of @xmath68 , we work with the absolute value of @xmath68 to quantify this trace . </S>",

    "<S> we can thus apply the concept we derived for the hermitian gws operator @xmath54 also to its non - hermitian counterpart @xmath42 with the essential difference being that the eigenvalues are now complex and sorted by their absolute value .    following this protocol also in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> we first measure the transmission amplitudes @xmath60 for two slightly different positions of the brass scatterer ( @xmath55 ) . </S>",

    "<S> in a next step we evaluate the eigenstates of @xmath42 and inject them directly through the antenna array at the input port . to test if our focusing protocol works successfully , we then measure the intensity distribution of the microwave field in the vicinity of the brass scatterer by an additional scanning antenna . </S>",
    "<S> this antenna is attached to a movable arm and enters through a grid of holes ( 5@xmath48 mm @xmath45 5@xmath48 mm ) in the top plate of the waveguide ( extending @xmath76 mm into the cavity ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : focus ] and [ fig : omission ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the displayed intensity profiles demonstrate very clearly that the largest eigenvalues correspond to states focusing on the target , see top row in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : focus ] . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates with the smallest eigenvalues , in turn , produce intensity patterns which are reduced almost to noise level in the vicinity of the target , see top row in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : omission ] . as an additional test of our protocol </S>",
    "<S> , we also recorded the wave intensity patterns after removing the brass scatterer altogether . in case of the focusing states </S>",
    "<S> such an intervention drastically changes the overall configuration of the intensity profiles , with intensity maxima near the position of the removed scatterer remaining clearly visible , see bottom row in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : focus ] . in the case of the states that avoid the brass scatterer , </S>",
    "<S> the wave intensity pattern remains almost unchanged as a whole when the scatterer is removed , see bottom row in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : omission ] . for the sake of clarity </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize here that the measurement of the intensity distribution in the interior of the investigated system serves only for demonstration purposes and is not necessary for implementing our protocol in the first place .    to summarize , we present here an extension of the wigner - smith time - delay operator to a whole class of operators with the exciting property of providing eigenstates that focus on or avoid a designated target inside a disordered medium . </S>",
    "<S> these generalized wigner - smith ( gws ) operators require the information stored in a system s scattering matrix , but , as we show here , a construction based on the transmission ( or reflection ) matrix alone still maintains its useful features . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the transmission matrix of a system has meanwhile not only been demonstrated for the presented case of microwaves , but also for acoustics @xcite , seismology @xcite , and recently also for optics @xcite . as a `` guidestar '' @xcite for focusing deep in the multiple scattering regime , </S>",
    "<S> we use a movable scatterer inside the medium whose spatial shift leaves conspicuous traces in the measured transmission matrix that we exploit for our protocol . in the practical applications that we envision for future implementations , the spatial shift of the target scatterer could , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , result from the self - propelled movement of an object inside an otherwise static medium or be excited from the outside through an ultrasound focal spot that can be conveniently scanned through the medium ( see @xcite for recent implementations ) . since , </S>",
    "<S> in particular , many biological media are turbid for optical light but only weakly scattering for ultrasound , such optical focusing techniques enabled by ultrasound have recently already been successfully explored in biomedical imaging ( see @xcite for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> so far , however , these techniques had to rely on `` optical phase conjugation '' techniques to time - reverse a scattered wave to a scattering target . </S>",
    "<S> our new approach has the advantage that it works without such a time - reversal mirror for light and that the degree of focusing can be tuned up to the point where a target inside a medium can be entirely avoided rather than focused on </S>",
    "<S> . the latter feature may be particularly attractive for imaging techniques for which it is imperative that certain parts of an imaged tissue do not get exposed to radiation . while the presented experiment using ten guided modes serves as a proof - of - principle demonstration </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the full potential of the method can be exploited once many modes are accessible as in the optical domain using spatial light modulators @xcite .    </S>",
