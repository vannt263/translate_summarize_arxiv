    "the idea here is that , while ucds are rapid rotators ( mohanty & basri @xcite , bailer - jones @xcite ) with likely periods of 310hrs , heterogeneous variations in opacity on a shorter timescale could account for the observed signature . in an earlier review of the literature , bailer - jones @xcite",
