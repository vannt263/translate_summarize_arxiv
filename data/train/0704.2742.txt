    "the high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductor can be considered a doped two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator with strong coulomb repulsion . @xcite most commonly , one accepts that the physics of the cuprates can be understood within the simplest one - band models of strong correlated systems such as the hubbard and @xmath2 models .",
    "it seems impossible to obtain analytic solutions for the ground states of these 2d models .",
    "therefore , a variational approach based on a choice of an appropriate trial wave function can be considered as a natural way to solve the cuprate problem .",
    "@xcite    the wave function of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) ground state @xcite derived from gutzwiller projected @xcite @xmath3  -  wave ground state of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) model eliminates a possibility of double occupancy of a site ( _ no double - occupancy constraint _ ) and corresponds to extremely strong on - site correlations .",
    "a great many of important results , obtained within the rvb approach , can be considered as a ground of the physics of the cuprates .    however , the problem is complicated by the fact that , in a strong correlated system , ground state energies of different ordered states may be close to each other : @xcite @xmath3  -  wave superconductor ( dsc ) , staggered flux phase , @xcite spin and charge density waves ( sdw and cdw , respectively ) and some others .",
    "@xcite account of the competition and coexistence of such ordered states within extremely simplified models by numerical tools leads to a wide variety of phase diagrams .",
    "it is clear that , among them , one can always find the diagrams reminding those typical of the cuprates .",
    "various approximations within the on - site coulomb repulsion models often lead to antipodal conclusions concerning a possibility of the superconducting ( sc ) state itself .",
    "@xcite the complete suppression of the double occupancy under gutzwiller s projection promotes a rise of an insulating rather than sc order . in this connection ,",
    "laughlin @xcite has proposed an alternative approach to clarify the problem of the superconductivity of the cuprates . instead of numerical study of a highly simplified hamiltonian , he suggested to select a reasonable ground state in order to determine the hamiltonian leading to such a state .    to take into account a realistic on - site repulsion , the ground state of laughlin s gossamer superconductor @xcite is chosen in the form of an incomplete projected bcs @xmath3  -  wave state with partially suppressed double occupancy .",
    "hamiltonian with such an exact forethought ground state , along with strong on - site repulsion , manifests an attractive term which can lead to dsc state .",
    "@xcite    gossamer superconductivity of the underdoped compound can be associated with a band of states with relatively low spectral weight inside a pronounced insulating forbidden band so that the chemical potential turns out to be pinned near the middle of this band .",
    "@xcite    the repulsion - induced dsc state is highly sensitive to electron dispersion .",
    "@xcite the simplest tight - binding approximation taking into account only the nearest neighbors ( @xmath4  -  model ) seems to be insufficient , therefore , it is necessary to consider more complicated dispersion with the next nearest neighbor terms ( @xmath5  -  model ) .",
    "numerical study shows @xcite that the stable dsc state corresponds to hopping integral ratio @xmath6 within a narrow range near @xmath7 .",
    "just the same value of @xmath6 is consistent with available angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data .",
    "@xcite    as follows from the @xmath8 approach to the rvb problem , @xcite it is necessary to consider doublets of fermions and bosons to realize the spin - charge separation correctly .",
    "@xcite two minima of the @xmath8 boson dispersion are relative to the points ( @xmath9 ) and ( @xmath10 ) in the 2d brillouin zone , @xcite therefore , the sc pairing channel corresponding to large pair momentum should be taken into account along with the cooper channel corresponding to zero pair momentum .",
    "geshkenbein et al .",
    "@xcite have assumed that an enhancement of the scattering between the saddle points of electron dispersion results in the fact that the electron - electron interaction with large momentum transfer can be `` less repulsive '' with respect to small transfer .",
    "therefore , in the vicinities of the saddle points , fermions may be paired into bosons .",
    "such noncoherent preformed pairs arising near the antinodal arcs of the fermi contour ( fc ) might exist in the pseudogap state of underdoped cuprates as a normal bose liquid .",
    "@xcite    the fc outside of the arcs corresponds to unpaired fermions coexisting with the preformed pairs .",
    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the preformed pairs with large momentum due to their interaction with unpaired particles results in the sc gap on the whole of the fc .",
    "the sc state that arises in such a way describes reasonably rather wide ( intermediate with respect to bcs and bec limiting cases ) fluctuation region above @xmath1 .",
    "instabilities in 2d strong correlated electron system were investigated within the @xmath5    model at small @xmath11 by renormalization - group ( rg ) methods @xcite using a discretization of the fc into a finite number of patches .",

    "the singularities in the insulating and sc channels corresponding to zero and @xmath17 pair momenta , respectively , are found to be logarithmic in the case of small but nonzero @xmath18 .",
    "such a case corresponds to approximately nested fc disposed close to saddle - point van hove singularity .",
    "rg approach , involving the nesting effects , @xcite gives a possibility to select singular contributions into pairing channels but remains corresponding pre - exponential factors to be undetermined .",

    "thus , there should be two sc gap parameters related to large and zero pair momentum , respectively .",

    "@xcite    in the case of nested fc , the kohn singularity transforms into the peierls one with strong anisotropy of @xmath31 .",

    "dotted line shows magnetic brillouin zone boundary .",
    "shaded : dark narrow ovals correspond to vicinities of peierls singularity of screening ; light half - ovals designate extended saddle point vicinities . ]    in the case of phonon - mediated pairing with account of coulomb repulsion , @xcite the nl of the order parameter coincides with the boundary enclosing the domain of dynamic constraint . in this domain , attraction dominates logarithmically weakened repulsion in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this nl is disposed everywhere outside of the fc , therefore , mirror nesting of the fc can be considered as the only condition of the @xmath50  -  pairing under attraction .",
    "peierls enhancement of the pairing interaction results in a strong anisotropy of the nl disposed close to the fc inside @xmath99 .",
    "this corresponds to an increase in the dominant part of @xmath99 that mainly contributes into the logarithmic singularity in the self - consistency equation and thus increases a magnitude of @xmath130 ( it is clear , that @xmath150 should be much lesser than @xmath39 ) .    since the sc order parameter arising in the @xmath50  -  channel",
    "is essentially momentum - dependent , there are three characteristic lines of zeroes : 1 ) the pfc on which kinetic energy of the pair equals zero , @xmath151 ; 2 ) the nl of the order parameter determined by @xmath152 ; 3 ) the curve on which quasiparticle group velocity changes sign , @xmath153 .",
    "these three lines may have common points of intersection inside @xmath99 , therefore , the nl can be disposed both above and below the pfc .",
    "this results in qualitatively different non - monotonic momentum dependence of coherence factors @xmath154 for two kinds of directions in the @xmath49  -  space intersecting at first the pfc and then the nl and vice versa . under pairing repulsion , the scattering across the nl turns out to be dominating in comparison with scattering inside or outside the nl in accordance with suhl inequality eq.([9 ] ) .    due to the fact that @xmath132 in the strong pseudogap state , coherence factors in diagonal gorkov function ( [ 19 ] ) may overlap each other near the pfc even above @xmath1 . on the contrary ,",
    "the bcs coherence factors are step - wise functions without an overlap in the normal fermi liquid state .",
    "the sc state that arises below @xmath1 should be described by both diagonal and off - diagonal ( anomalous ) gorkov functions .",
    "taking into account the fact that mean - field ( averaged over random phases ) pseudogap parameter @xmath131 vanishes whereas mean - field sc condensate parameter @xmath155 below @xmath1 , one can introduce off - diagonal gorkov function @xmath156 in a phenomenological way similar to that we use to obtain diagonal gorkov function ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "this function describes the odlro state @xcite and can be written as @xmath157 factor @xmath139 is defined inside each of the crystal equivalent domains of kinematic constraint @xmath158 where @xmath159 in the case of tetragonal symmetry of cuprate planes .",
    "paired states with large total momenta @xmath160 , both coherent and non - coherent , arise exactly inside these domains .",
    "parameters @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are identical for any of @xmath158 differing only by the domain of definition of @xmath49 .    in the whole of the brillouin zone , the sc order parameter in the mixed representation , @xmath164 , can be presented as a superposition , @xmath165 where @xmath166 is center - of - mass radius - vector , coefficients @xmath167 should be chosen in accordance with the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "as a function of @xmath166 , order parameter ( [ 23 ] ) arising in the @xmath50  -  channel turns out to be spatially modulated similar to fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state .",
    "@xcite such a modulation with relatively short wavelength reflects a variation of @xmath50  -  pair density and can be associated with a pair density wave with a checkerboard order in cuprate planes .",
    "thus , the @xmath50  -  pairing leads to a microscopic ground of the pair density wave concept introduced phenomenologically by zhang .",
    "@xcite    the sc order parameter can be expanded over the eigenfunctions of pairing operator ( [ 7 ] ) , @xcite @xmath168 in the simplest case , repulsion - induced sc pairing can be described by two - component order parameter , so that two complex components , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , form the order parameter structure in the framework of ginzburg - landau phenomenology .",
    "absolute values and relative phase of the components are connected with the relative motion of @xmath50  -  pair .",
    "as follows from ginzburg - landau equation system for two - component order parameter , @xcite two qualitatively different sc states become admissible .",
    "one of them corresponds to constant value @xmath171 of the relative phase of the components that is generic for repulsion - induced superconductivity .",
    "the other state , with the relative phase different from @xmath172 , can be related to a change of the phase of the wave function of @xmath50  -  pair due to a rise of internal magnetic field of spontaneous orbital currents .",
    "such currents can be associated @xcite with insulating orbital antiferromagnetic order , for example , in the form of ddw .",
    "superposition ( [ 23 ] ) mixes , in particular , two paired states with opposite momenta , @xmath50 and @xmath173 .",
    "it is clear that particles composing pairs with these momenta can compose pairs with zero momentum .",
    "thus , the cooper channel appears to be associated with the @xmath50  -  channel in accordance with symmetry consideration .    in such a case , mean - field order parameters @xmath174 and",
    "@xmath146 corresponding to the cooper and @xmath50  -  channels , respectively , should be the solution to a self - consistency equation system .",
    "this system degenerates into two independent equations ( each of them determines one of the order parameters ) if one neglects the interconnection of the channels .",
    "then , one would obtain temperatures , @xmath1 and @xmath175 , of transitions into the states with order parameters @xmath146 and @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "let us assume that @xmath176 even in the case when attractive phonon - mediated pairing contributes to the cooper channel .",
    "then , sc transition temperature @xmath1 can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) .    at @xmath177 , there arises sc order due to @xmath50  -  pairing with order parameter @xmath146 defined in relatively small vicinities of the pfc where factor @xmath139 is close to unity .",
    "inside this temperature range , cooper pairing on the whole of the fc should be induced by @xmath50  -  pairing . in this case , the magnitude of @xmath174 has to be small in comparison with the magnitude of @xmath146 .",
    "thus , _ biordered _ sc state arising in such a way should be described by two order parameters , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , defined in the vicinities of the pfc and entire fc , respectively . as temperature decreases from @xmath1 down to @xmath180 , cooper ordering with order parameter @xmath179 exists as induced by the @xmath50  -  channel of sc pairing . in this case , the superfluid density turns out to be approximately proportional to the pfc length .",
    "opening of the cooper channel at @xmath180 leads to a considerable increase in @xmath179 and , as a result , in the superfluid density which becomes proportional to the whole of the fc length at @xmath181 .    in the vicinities of the pfc ,",
    "two branches ( @xmath182 ) of strong anisotropic quasiprticle spectrum of the biordered superconductor can be written in the form @xmath183 here , we take into account the fact that kinetic energy of @xmath50  -  pair ( [ 4 ] ) is equal to kinetic energy of cooper pair , @xmath184 two - gap spectrum ( [ 25 ] ) , with the lesser gap @xmath185 observable at excitation energies up to the greater gap @xmath186 , should be apparent at @xmath181 . above the greater gap the spectral weight transfers from the low to high - energy branch of quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "diagonal and off - diagonal gorkov functions of the biordered sc state preserve their form , eq.([19 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) , respectively , with the exception of the fact that sc order parameter @xmath178 has to take into account both sc pairing channels .",
    "thus , these two channels result in two coexisting odlro states .",
    "most likely , cooper channel , including both coulomb and phonon - mediated pairing , can not result in a rise of qss .",
    "therefore , sc gap parameter turns out to be bcs - like everywhere on the fc with the exception of the pfc on which the unconventional @xmath50  -  channel is opened .",
    "symmetry of the biordered sc state is determined by eqs.([23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) where @xmath187 should be considered as the components of momentum dependent order parameter arising as a result of both cooper and @xmath50  -  pairing .",
    "one can approximately represent the gap parameter in the conventional form @xmath188 where momentum dependent magnitude @xmath189 reflects mainly strongly anisotropic contribution of the @xmath50  -  pairing .",
    "upper ( lower ) sign in eq.([27 ] ) corresponds to extended @xmath190(@xmath3 )  -  wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "it should be noted that , in the case of peierls enhanced @xmath50  -  pairing , nodal line of order parameter @xmath126 may pass through the center of the corresponding domain of kinematic constraint .",
    "this results in the fact that order parameter @xmath126 differs in sign on the opposite parts of the pfc .     and",
    "@xmath1 are phase transition temperatures corresponding to neel af and unconventional sc orders , respectively ; @xmath143 is strong pseudogap ( spg ) crossover temperature , @xmath191 bounds the region of weak pseudogap ( wpg ) state .",
    "high doping and temperature state corresponds to normal fermi liquid ( fl ) . on top ,",
    "there are shown doping ranges in which one can expect a rise of qss , qss together with bs and bs . ]",
    "we believe that biordered superconductivity may be generic for such superconductors as doped cuprate compounds .",
    "unconventional features of these compounds , especially , universality of their phase diagram ( fig.4 ) , can be associated with evolution of the fc and pairing interaction with doping .",
    "it is clear that singular contribution to coulomb pairing interaction is sensitive to doping dependent form of the fc .",
    "therefore , one can suppose that oscillating real - space pairing potential @xmath192 varies with doping in such a way that only noncoherent qss of sc pairs arise under extremely low doping .",
    "this corresponds to strong pseudogap penetrating into insulating region of doping below the onset of superconductivity at @xmath193 . in underdoped region @xmath194 , along with qss",
    ", there is a bound state .",
    "both bound state energy @xmath195 and qss decay @xmath118 increase with doping so that , near optimal doping @xmath196 , pair - break energy approximately coincides with the energy corresponding to the loss of phase coherence .",
    "thus , in overdoped regime @xmath197 , pairing interaction can result in only bound state .    as doping increases",
    ", the @xmath50  -  channel may be dominated by the cooper channel and overdoped sc state can manifest properties inherent in conventional bcs state . when doping exceeds @xmath196 , a decrease in @xmath1 down to @xmath198 at @xmath199 can be also associated with doping dependence of the pairing interaction .",
    "this interaction becomes more repulsive at @xmath200 as the fc gradually leaves the vicinity of the extended van hove saddle point .",
    "a suppression of the phonon - mediated component of the sc pairing may have the same origin , effective increase in repulsion can result in the fact that inequality ( [ 10 ] ) can be reversed because of not too large ratio @xmath201 typical of cuprates .    there is rather strong evidence that , in underdoped cuprates , dimensionless ratio @xmath202 considerably exceeds universal bcs value @xmath203 .",
    "@xcite here , @xmath204 has meaning of the sc energy gap extrapolated down to @xmath52 . in underdoped biordered superconductor",

    "taking into account the fact that @xmath1 is determined by @xmath50  -  pairing only and @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are , generally speaking , of the same order , one can easily conclude that ratio @xmath202 may considerably exceed @xmath203 ( observed in ref.@xcite values @xmath209 ) . in overdoped regime ,",
    "strong pseudogap parameter @xmath210 and the cooper channel dominates @xmath50  -  pairing .",
    "therefore , @xmath202 should be close to @xmath203 in accordance with the bcs theory .",

    "; conversely , off - condensate particle density decreases .",
    "drude - like behavior of the coherent contribution into optical conductivity @xmath213 , observed below @xmath1 , can be connected with rather high off - condensate density ( experimental data available @xcite show that spectral weight of the off - condensate particles may exceed spectral weight of the sc condensate below @xmath1 ) . at @xmath181 , drude component of the optical conductivity of biordered superconductor , @xmath214 ,",
    "should be suppressed due to shedding of the off - condensate particles into the condensate of cooper pairs .",
    "all homologous cuprate series investigated demonstrate universal dependence of @xmath1 on the number of @xmath216 layers in the unitary cell , @xmath217 , with maximum at @xmath218 .",
    "@xcite strong initial increase in @xmath217 can not be associated with local real - space pairing interaction .",
    "weak interlayer tunnelling can explain this feature qualitatively by rather small effective enhancement of the coupling constant .",
    "@xcite coulomb pairing with finite screening length ensures strong correlation between electrons in the nearest - neighbor layers and results in a quantitative explanation of @xmath217 leading to almost triple increase of the coupling constant .",
    "@xcite    doping dependent isotope effect , observed in cuprate superconductors , @xcite is highly sensitive to sample quality and reflects the contribution of phonon - mediated component to the sc pairing interaction .",
    "depending on the interrelation between coulomb and phonon - mediated contributions , @xcite the exponent of the isotope effect on @xmath1 can be close to both zero , in the case of dominating repulsion , and bcs limit in the opposite case of dominating phonon - mediated attraction .",
    "relative isotope shift , negligible above optimum doping , increases with underdoping .",
    "we believe that this can be considered as an indirect evidence in behalf of the fact that , in the case of low doping , coulomb correlation effects dominate phonon - mediated contribution to the @xmath50  -  channel which determines @xmath1 in biordered superconductor .",
    "the isotope effect on the london penetration depth @xmath219 , absent within the bcs theory , also turns out to be enhanced with underdoping .",
    "@xcite the penetration length is weakly sensitive to isotope substitution in a wide temperature range well below @xmath1 .",
    "then , starting from @xmath220 , the isotope shift on @xmath219 increases gradually at @xmath221 .",
    "as @xmath222 , such a behavior of isotope effect on @xmath219 can be associated with temperature and doping dependence od superfluid density inherent in the biordered sc state .",
