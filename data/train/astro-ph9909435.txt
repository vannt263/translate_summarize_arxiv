    "many ideas about the nature of @xmath1-ray bursts have been discussed during last 25 years after the burst discovery ( for a review , see blaes 1994 , harding 1994 , hartman 1995 ; dermer & weiler 1995 , fishman & meegan 1995 , greiner 1998 , piran 1998 ) . among these ideas",
    ", there was a suggestion that the sources of @xmath1-ray bursts ( grbs ) are at cosmological distances , i.e. at a redshift @xmath5 ( usov & chibisov 1975 , van den berg 1983 , paczyski 1986 , goodman 1986 , eichler et al .",
    "1989 ) . after the batse data became available ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) , the idea of a cosmological origin of grb sources has come to be taken very seriously ( e.g. , paczyski 1991 , fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "recent detections of absorption and emission features at a redshift @xmath6 in the optical afterglow of grb 970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) and at redshift @xmath7 in the host galaxy of grb 971214 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) clearly demonstrate that at least some of the grb sources lie at cosmological distances .",
    "a common feature of all acceptable models of cosmological @xmath1-ray bursters is a relativistic wind as the source of grb radiation .",
    "the lorentz factor , @xmath8 , of such a wind is about @xmath9 or even more ( e.g. , fenimore , epstein & ho 1993 , baring & harding 1997 ) .",
    "a very strong magnetic field may be in the plasma outflowing from cosmological @xmath1-ray bursters ( usov 1992 , 1994a , b , thompson & duncan 1993 , blackman , yi & field 1996 , vietri 1996 , katz 1997 , mszros & rees 1997a , dai & lu 1998 ) .",
    "below , we discuss both thermal and non - thermal radiation from relativistic strongly magnetized winds that are plausible sources of cosmological @xmath1-ray bursters .",
    "the energy output of cosmological @xmath1-ray bursters in @xmath1-rays typically is @xmath10 ergs ( e.g. , wickramasinghe et al . 1993 , tamblyn & melia 1993 , lipunov et al . 1995 ) and may be as high as @xmath11 ergs ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) or even more ( kulkarni et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these estimates assume isotropic emission of grbs .",
    "such a high energetics of cosmological @xmath1-ray bursters and a short time scale of @xmath1-ray flux variability call for very compact objects as sources of grbs ( hartmann 1995 , piran 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "these objects may be either millisecond pulsars which are arisen from accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs in close binaries ( usov 1992 ) or differentially rotating disk - like objects which are formed by the merger of a binary consisting of two neutron stars ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 , narayan , paczyski & piran 1992 ) .",
    "such very young fast - rotating compact objects have two possible sources of energy which may be responsible for the radiation of cosmological grbs .",
    "these are the thermal energy of the compact objects and the kinetic energy of their rotation .",
    "the thermal energy may be transformed into @xmath1-rays by means of the following sequence of processes ( for review , see piran 1998 ) : ( 1 ) emission of neutrinos and cooling of the object ; ( 2 ) absorption of neutrinos @xmath12 and formation of a fireball which mainly consists of electrons and positrons ; ( 3 ) expansion of the fireball and formation of a relativistic shell , @xmath13 ; ( 4 ) interaction of the shell with an external medium and acceleration of electrons to very high energies ; and ( 5 ) generation of @xmath1-rays by highly accelerated electrons .    the maximum thermal energy , @xmath14 , of very young compact objects is high enough to explain the energy output of cosmological gbbs , @xmath15 a few @xmath16 ergs . however , the fraction of the thermal energy that is converted into the energy of the electron - positron fireball and then into the kinetic energy of the relativistic shell is very small and can not be essentially more than @xmath17 ( goodman , dar & nussinov 1987 , eichler et al .",
    "1989 , janka & ruffert 1996 , piran 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the efficiency of transformation of the kinetic energy of a relativistic shell into radiation can not be more than @xmath18% ( blandford & eichler 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , neutrino powered winds outflowing from very young compact objects may be responsible for the radiation of cosmological grbs only if they are well collimated , with opening angle about a few degrees or even less .",
    "for both neutron stars and post - merger objects , such a collimation of neutrino powered winds is very questionable ( woosley 1993 , piran 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the rotational energy of compact objects at the moment of their formation may be comparable with the thermal energy , @xmath19",
    ". the efficiency of transformation of the rotational energy to the energy of a relativistic strongly magnetized wind and then to the energy of high - frequency radiation may be as high as almost 100% ( see usov 1994a , b ; blackman et al .",
    "1996 and below ) .",
    "for some time the theoretical expectation has been that rotation powered neutron stars ( pulsars ) should generate collimated outflows ( e.g. , benford 1984 , michel 1985 , sulkanen & lovelace 1990 ) .",
    "the crab , vela , psr b1509 - 58 and possible psr b1951 + 32 all show evidence that this is indeed the case ( hester 1998 , gaensler et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "if the energy flux from the source of grb 990123 in the direction to the earth is only about ten times more than the energy flux averaged over all directions , the model of grbs based on the rotation powered winds can easily explain the energetics of such an extremal event as grb 990123 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "such an anisotropy of emission from the burst sources does nt contradict available data on grbs ( e.g. , perna & loeb 1998 ) . in the case of typical grbs with the energy output of @xmath10 ergs",
    ", this model can explain their energetics even if the emission of grbs is nearly isotropic .",
    "therefore , the rotational energy of compact objects is a plausible source of energy for cosmological grbs , not the thermal energy .    in many papers ( e.g. , usov 1992 , thompson & duncan 1993 , blackman et al .",
    "1996 ; kluniak & ruderman 1998 ) , it was argued that the strength of the magnetic field @xmath20 at the surface of compact objects may be as high as @xmath21  g or even more .",
    "such a strong magnetic field leads to both deceleration of the rotation of the compact object on a time scale of seconds and generation of a strongly magnetized wind that flows away from the object at relativistic speeds , @xmath22 ( e.g. , usov 1994a ) .",
    "the outflowing wind is poynting flux@xmath23dominated , i.e. , @xmath24 , where    @xmath25    is the luminosity of the compact object in the poynting flux , @xmath26 is its luminosity in both electron - positron pairs and radiation , @xmath27 is the speed of light , @xmath28 is the radius of the compact object and @xmath29 is its angular velocity ; @xmath30 cm and @xmath31 s@xmath32 for both millisecond pulsars and post - merger objects . for compact objects with extremely strong magnetic fields , @xmath33 g , it is expected that @xmath34 is @xmath35 ( usov 1994a ) .",
    "a plausible magnetic topology for a relativistic magnetized wind outflowing from an oblique rotator ( @xmath36 ) with a nearly dipole magnetic field is shown in figure  [ fig1_u ] ,    where @xmath37 is the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes .",
    "near the rotational poles , the wind field should be helical ( e.g. , coroniti 1990 ) .",
    "this is because the magnetic flux originates in a single polar cap .",
    "near the rotational equator , the toroidal magnetic field of the wind should be striped and alternates in polarity on a scalelength of @xmath38 cm .",
    "these magnetic stripes are separated by thin current sheets @xmath39 . off the equator ,",
    "the magnetic flux in the toward and away stripes is unequal if @xmath40 . in other words , in the striped region ,",
    "the wind field is a superposition of a pure helical field and a pure striped field with nearly equal magnetic fluxes in adjacent stripes .",
    "since the luminosity of a @xmath1-ray burster in a relativistic magnetized wind drops in time , @xmath41 , the wind structure at the moment @xmath42 is similar to a shell with the radius @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a numerical index , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 s is the characteristic time of deceleration of the compact object rotation because of the action of the electromagnetic torque and the torque connected with the generation of gravitational radiation ( usov 1992 , yi & blackman 1998 ) .",
    "the thickness of the shell is @xmath47 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in the shell is about    @xmath48    where @xmath49s@xmath50 cm is the radius of the light cylinder .    for relativistic , strongly magnetized winds with @xmath51 ergs s@xmath32 and @xmath52 ,",
    "the optical depth of the outflowing electron - positron plasma near the compact objects is very high , up to @xmath53 ( usov 1994a ) . in this case , the electron - positron plasma and radiation are in quasi - thermodynamic equilibrium . during outflow ,",
    "the electron - positron plasma accelerates and its density decreases ( e.g. , paczyski 1986 , goodman 1986 ) . at a distance @xmath54 from the compact object , where the optical depth for the bulk of the photons is @xmath55 , the radiation propagates freely .",
    "the radius of the wind photosphere is @xmath56 cm , and the lorentz factor of the outflowing plasma at the photosphere is @xmath57 ( see   3 ) .    at the distance",
    "@xmath58    the magnetic field of the wind is frozen in the outflowing plasma ( usov 1994a , blackman & yi 1998 ) , and there is no reason for powerful non - thermal radiation to be generated .    at @xmath59 ,",
    "the wind density is not sufficient to screen displacement currents , and the striped component of the wind field is transformed into large - amplitude electromagnetic waves ( laemws ) ( usov 1975 , 1994a , b , blackman et al .",
    "1996 , melatos & melrose 1996a , b ) .",
    "outflowing particles are accelerated in the field of laemws and generate powerful synchro - compton radiation ( see   4 ) .    at @xmath60 ,",
    "the magnetic field is helical everywhere in the outflowing wind ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . such a relativistic strongly magnetized wind expands more or less freely up to the distance    @xmath61    at which deceleration of the wind due to its interaction with an ambient medium becomes important ( rees & mszros 1992 ) , where @xmath62 is the density of the ambient medium and @xmath63 is the kinetic energy of the outflowing wind , @xmath64 .",
    "it was suggested by mszros and rees ( 1992 , 1993 ) that in the process of the wind @xmath23 ambient medium interaction at @xmath65 , an essential part of the wind energy may be transferred to high - energy electrons and then to high - frequency ( x - ray and @xmath1-ray ) emission .",
    "this suggestion was recently confirmed by numerical simulations ( see smolsky & usov 1996 , 1999 , usov & smolsky 1998 and   5 ) .    summarizing , in relativistic strongly magnetized winds there are three regions where powerful radiation of grbs may be generated .",
    "the first radiating region is the wind photosphere that is at the distance @xmath56 cm from the compact object .",
    "the second radiating region is at the distance @xmath66 cm . in this region ,",
    "the striped component of the wind field is transformed into laemws .",
    "the third radiating region is at the distance @xmath67 cm where deceleration of the wind due to its interaction with the ambient medium becomes important .",
    "below , we consider radiation from all these regions .",
    "for a spherical optically thick electron - positron wind , the radius of the photosphere is ( paczyski 1990 )    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the temperature of the electron - positron plasma at @xmath70 in the comoving frame , @xmath71 ergs @xmath72 k @xmath73 s@xmath32 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and and @xmath74 is the mean lorentz factor of the ourflowing plasma at @xmath70 .    since @xmath75 and @xmath76",

    "therefore , any energy that is inherited by particles and radiation at the distance to the compact object a few times smaller than @xmath54 will be thermalized before it is radiated at @xmath70 .",
    "the temperature that corresponds to the blackbody - like radiation from the wind photosphere is    @xmath81    the mean energy of thermal photons is @xmath82 . for typical parameters of the wind sources , @xmath83 g ,",

    "the flux of particles at @xmath87 is ( paczyski 1990 )    @xmath88    where @xmath89 @xmath90 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "equations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) yield    @xmath91    from equations ( 1 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) , we can see that the total energy flux of the wind in electron - positron pairs at @xmath92 is a very small part of the luminosity of the compact object in both electron - positron pairs and radiation at the moment of its formation , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the electron mass .",

    "the plasma density decreases in proportion to @xmath99 while the critical density is @xmath100 . at the distance @xmath101 that is given by equation ( 3 ) , the plasma density is equal to the critical density , @xmath102 . at @xmath103  cm ,",
    "the plasma density is not sufficient to screen displacement currents , and the striped component of the wind field is transformed into laemws due to development of magneto - parametric instability ( usov 1975 , 1994a , b , blackman et al .",

    "dominated wind is purely striped just as vacuum magnetic dipole waves ( michel 1971 ) , and almost all energy of the wind is radiated in x - rays and @xmath1-rays at @xmath108 ( usov 1994a , blackman et al .",
    "1996 , blackman & yi 1998 ) . in this case",
    ", the total energy output in hard photons per a grb may be as high as @xmath110 a few @xmath16 ergs .    at @xmath111 , when the bulk of the wind energy is transferred into @xmath1-rays at @xmath108 and the residual energy of the wind at @xmath60 is small , afterglows which are generated at @xmath112 and accompany grbs are weak irrespective of that the grbs themselves may be quite strong .",
    "this may explain the fact that x - ray , optical and radio afterglows have been observed in some strong grbs but not in others ( e.g. , piran 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "for consideration of the interaction between a relativistic magnetized wind and an ambient medium , it is convenient to switch to the co - moving frame of the outflowing plasma ( the wind frame ) . while changing the frame , the magnetic and electric fields in the wind are reduced from @xmath113 and @xmath114^{1/2 } \\simeq b$ ] in the frame of the @xmath1-ray burster to @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the wind frame . using this and equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) ,",

    "synchro - compton radiation of high - energy electrons closely resembles synchrotron radiation ( e.g. blumenthal & tucker 1974 , smolsky & usov 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , to model the spectrum of synchro - compton radiation , we replace the fields of laemws @xmath230 and @xmath231 by a constant magnetic field which is equal to the mean field of laemws @xmath232 .",
    "the energy losses of electrons in such a magnetic field are governed by ( landau & lifshitz 1971 )            where @xmath236 is the distribution function of high - energy electrons in the region ahead of the wind front per unit area of the front at the moment @xmath157 , @xmath237 is the rate of production of high - energy electrons per unit area of the front , and @xmath238 is the average spectrum of high - energy electrons which are injected into the region ahead of the front .",

    "for this radiation , the characteristic energy of photons is in the batse range ( band et al .",
    "1993 , schaefer 1994 , 1998 , fishman & meegan 1995 , preece et al .",
    "the spectrum of synchro - compton radiation displays a continuous hard to soft evolution , in agreement with observational data on grbs ( bhat et al .",
    "1994 ) .    to fit the observed spectra of grbs , for accelerated electrons it was usually taken either a three - dimensional relativistic maxwellian distribution ( katz 1994a , b ) or a sum of a three - dimensional relativistic maxwellian distribution and a suprathermal power - law tail ( tavani 1996a , b ) .",
    "the thermal character of the electron distribution ( or its part ) is consistent with our results ( see   5.3 ) . in our simulations ,",
    "we observe a two - dimensional relativistic maxwellian distribution of accelerated electrons .",
    "however , the difference between 2d and 3d maxwellian distributions does not change the calculated spectrum of synchrotron radiation significantly ( jones & hardee 1979 , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .    in many papers ( see , for a review piran 1998 ) ,",
    "the interaction of a relativistic wind with an ambient medium and non - thermal radiation generated at @xmath171 were considered in the frame of the conventional model which was based on the following assumptions .",
    "\\(1 ) two collisionless shocks form : an external shock that propagates from the wind front into the ambient medium , and an internal shock that propagates from the wind front into the inner wind , with a contact discontinuity at the wind front between the shocked material .",
    "the idea about formation of two collisionless shocks near the front of a relativistic wind outflowing from a cosmological @xmath1-ray burster is based mainly on both theoretical studies which have shown that collisionless shocks can form in a rarified plasma ( e.g. , tidman & krall 1971 , dawson 1983 , quest 1985 ) and the fact that such shocks have been observed in the vicinities of a few comets and planets ( e.g. , leroy et al .",
    "1982 , livesey , kennel & russell 1982 , omidi & winske 1990 ) . undoubtedly , collisionless shocks exist and can accelerate electrons to ultrarelativistic energies in many astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants and jets of active galactic nuclei",
    ". however , for the wind parameters which are relevant to cosmological grbs ( see   2 ) , formation of collisionless shocks in the vicinity of the wind front is very questionable , especially if @xmath8 is as high as @xmath262 or more ( e.g. , smolsky & usov 1996 , 1999 , mitra 1996 , brainerd 1999 ) . as to an internal shock",
    ", it can not form in a poynting flux - dominated wind , in principle ( e.g. , kennel , fujimura & okamoto 1983 , kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "our model of the wind @xmath23 ambient medium interaction qualitatively differs from the conventional model which is based on the assumption that an external collisionless shock forms just ahead of the wind front .",
    "although it might seem that observational consequences of our model must differ from observational consequences of the conventional model significantly , this is not the case .",
    "moreover , we can see that all the listed assumptions of the conventional model except of the first one are confirmed by our simulations .",
    "there is only a modification that laemws are embedded in the region ahead of the wind front instead of magnetic fields , and highly accelerated electrons generate high - frequency emission of grbs via synchro - compton radiation .",
    "however , in our case synchro - compton radiation closely resembles synchrotron radiation .",
    "therefore , if in the conventional model of grb emission from the shocked region ahead of the wind front the mechanism of electron acceleration by a relativistic collisionless shock is replaced by the mechanism of electron acceleration at the wind front , this model will remain otherwise practically unchanged .    at @xmath263 ,",
    "the outflowing wind slows down due to its interaction with the ambient medium , and when the lorentz factor of the wind front is about several tens or less , an external shock may form just ahead of the front .",
    "we believe that the afterglows which are observed in @xmath211 s after some grbs result from acceleration of electrons by such shocks as it is generally accepted ( mszros & rees 1997b , vietri 1997 , waxman 1997 , wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ) ."
