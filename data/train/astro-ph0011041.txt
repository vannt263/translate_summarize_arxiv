    "dwarf galaxies in the local group ( lg ) clearly obey a morphology - density relation .",
    "close to the milky way and m31 we find early - type dwarf galaxies , namely faint ( @xmath0 ) low surface brightness dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) and more luminous ( @xmath1 ) , higher surface brightness dwarf ellipticals ( des ) .",
    "all these galaxies are nearly devoid of gas , contain dark matter and mainly old stars and are supported by velocity dispersion ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 , hereafter fb94 ; mateo 1998 , hereafter ma98 ; grebel 1999 , hereafter gr99 ; van den bergh 1999 ) . among them",
    "draco and ursa minor have the highest dark matter densities ever measured ( lake 1990 ) . on the outskirts of the lg we find similarly faint ( @xmath2 -18 ) and dark matter dominated dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) , that are gas rich , star - forming systems with disk - like kinematics ( ma98 , van den bergh 1999 , gr99 ) .",
    "previous attempts to explain the origin of dsphs in the lg have relied on gas dynamical processes to remove the gas in dirrs .",
    "gas stripping may result either because of the pressure exerted by an external hot gaseous medium in the halo of the milky way ( `` ram pressure '' ) ( einasto et al .",
    "1974 ) or because of internal strong supernovae winds ( dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "however , ram pressure would require an external gas density that is several orders of magnitude higher than recently inferred for the milky way ( murali 2000 ) and supernovae winds can not explain the existing morphology - density relation .",
    "moreover , such dissipative mechanisms would remove the gas but would not directly alter the structure and kinematics of the pre - existing stellar component .",
    "however , the light follows an exponential profile in both dsphs and dirrs ( faber & lin 1983 ; irwin & hatzdimitriou 1995 ; ma98 ) and a positive correlation between surface brightness and luminosity is shown by both types of dwarfs ( fb94 ) , suggesting an evolutionary link between them .",
    "is there a mechanism that can transform dwarf galaxies between morphological classes or must we accept the idea that dsphs are fundamentally different from dirrs ?    within rich galaxy clusters",
    ", fast fly - by encounters with the largest galaxies can transform a disk system into a spheroidal or s0 galaxy in just 3 - 4 gyr ( moore et al . 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "if the halos of bright galaxies were scaled down versions of galaxy clusters then this `` galaxy harassment '' would be equally important within them .",
    "however , whereas rich clusters contain over thirty large ( @xmath3 ) perturbing galaxies , the milky way and m31 have only a couple of satellites sufficiently massive to harass the other dwarf galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al . 1999 ) as a result , the rate for effective satellite - satellite fly - by encounters is less than one in every 10 gyr ( the lmc and the smc being a notable exception ) .",
    "thus , we are left only with the repeated action of tidal forces from the primary galaxy as an evolutionary driver .",
    "these operate on the orbital timescale , which is of order of 3 - 4 gyr in both clusters and galactic halos .",
    "however , given the relatively low age of large , virialized clusters , galaxies have typically approached the cluster center only once by the present time , while dsphs satellites have had sufficient time to complete several close tidal encounters with the milky way , as stellar ages imply that the latter was already in place 10 gyr ago ( van den bergh 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we use very high resolution n - body + sph simulations performed with the parallel binary treecode gasoline ( dikaiakos & stadel 1996 ; wadsley et al .",
    "2000 ) to follow the evolution of small galaxies resembling dirrs as they move on bound orbits in the tidal field of the massive dark matter halo of the milky way .",
    "the milky way halo is modeled as the fixed potential of a truncated isothermal sphere with a total mass @xmath4 inside a radius of @xmath5 kpc , consistent with both recent measures based on radial velocities of distant satellites ( wilkinson & evans 1999 ) and with generic models of structure formation ( peebles et al .",
    "the core radius is @xmath6 kpc and the resulting circular velocity at the solar radius is @xmath7 km / s .",
    "= 8truecm    our simulated galaxies are modeled as exponential disks of stars with a toomre parameter @xmath8 embedded in truncated isothermal dark matter halos ( see hernquist 1993 ) . the number of particles in the disk is 50,000 while that in the halo ranges from 250,000 to @xmath9 .",
    "such high resolution in the halo reduces considerably numerical heating of the disk due to massive halo particles , as was tested by evolving our models in isolation for 5 gyr .",
    "the scale - lengths and masses of the stellar disk and dark matter halo are chosen so that the satellites follow the observed b band tully - fisher relation ( hoffman et al .",
    "1996 ; zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ) and have realistic rotation curves ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; cote et al . 1997 ) , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the determination of general scaling properties of galaxies becomes more uncertain at the very faint end .",
    "current structure formation models predict that the mass @xmath10 and scale radius @xmath11 of halos ( and of their embedded disks ) vary with redshift as @xmath12 for a fixed value of the circular velocity @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( mo et al",
    ". 1998 ) .",
    "= 8truecm    the scaling with redshift reflects the fact that low mass halos form at early epochs and have higher characteristic densities because the average density of the universe was higher .",
    "galaxies with total masses",
    "@xmath15 10@xmath16 @xmath17 should typically form at @xmath18 ( lacey & cole 1993 ) and should live in halos with a central dark matter density @xmath19 0.3 @xmath20 , comparable to what inferred for gr8 , an extremely faint lg dirr ( carignan et al .",
    "the model with the smallest mass ( `` gr8 '' ) was built following these prescriptions .",
    "the models cover the entire luminosity function of irregulars in the lg ( ma98 ) with stellar masses of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 = -11.2 , `` gr8 '' ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath22=-16.23 , `` m2 '' ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath22=-18 , `` m1 '' ) . at fixed disk mass ( either m1 or m2 )",
    "we also vary the disk scale length , obtaining high surface brightness ( hsbs , @xmath25 mag arcsec@xmath26 , m1h and m2h ) or low surface brightness satellites ( lsbs , @xmath27 or @xmath28 mag arcsec@xmath26 , m1la , m2la , m2 lb ) for a total of six different models ( we always assume @xmath29=2 for the stellar disk and set the halo core radius equal to the disk scale length ; see de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "the gr8 model was obtained by rescaling model m1la for @xmath30 .",
    "the disk scale - length @xmath31 is only @xmath32 pc for gr8 , while those of the other models are , respectively , @xmath33 or @xmath34 kpc ( hsbs ) and @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 kpc ( lsbs ) .",
    "the total mass - to - light ratios at @xmath38 ( close to the peak of the rotation curves ) are , respectively , @xmath39 ( hsbs ) , @xmath40 ( lsbs ) and @xmath41(gr8 ) .",
    "as the milky way halo is modeled as an external potential , dynamical friction is neglected , which is a good approximation for satellites @xmath42 times less massive than the primary halo ( colpi et al .",
    "satellites start at the virial radius of the primary ( their apocenter ) as if they were infalling for the first time , moving on orbits whose ratio between apocenter and pericenter ranges from 4 to 10 , in agreement with simulations of galaxy and cluster formation ( ghigna 1998 ) .",
    "orbital periods are typically of the order of @xmath43 gyr , but are as short as @xmath44 gyr in the run with gr8 , because this model was evolved in a milky way potential scaled down in size and mass as expected at @xmath30 .",
    "the inclination and spin of the disk relative to the orbital plane are randomly selected . in",
    "total 40 different runs were performed .      as the dwarfs approach pericenter ( typically of 40 - 70 kpc )",
    "lsbs lose most of their dark matter halo and stars , due to their low density halos and large disks , and become weakly bar unstable .",
    "hsbs suffer modest stripping and their more self - gravitating disks develop a strong bar .",
    "the gr8 model is barely stripped owing to its very dense halo and its small disk radius .",
    "minimal stripping keeps its disk more self gravitating compared to the structurally similar lsb and thus a fairly strong bar can develop after the second pericenter passage .",
    "mass stripping for the various models is reflected in the evolution of their circular velocity profiles ( figure 1 ) .",
    "after completion of 2 - 3 orbits in 7 gyr , our `` tidally stirred '' dwarf galaxies bear a striking resemblance to the real dsphs ( right panel in figure 2 ) : direct tidal heating coupled with the buckling of the bar due to bending instabilities ( raha et al . 1991 ) transmute the small disks into spheroids supported by velocity dispersion instead of rotation ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the gr8-like dwarf , falling into the milky way halo around redshift 2 , suffers several ( 5 ) strong tidal shocks by the present time and is thus transformed despite being extremely compact .",
    "= 8truecm    on average the final @xmath45 ( i.e. the ratio of the rotational to random velocity ) inside the half mass radius @xmath46 drops mean values @xmath47 and @xmath48 varies in the range @xmath49 km s@xmath50 , as observed for dsphs and des in the lg ( ma98 ) . the largest of these values are typical of hsb remnants and are comparable to the velocity dispersion measured for the des associated to m31 ( ma98 ; kormendy 1987 ) . only when the satellite is initially in retrograde rotation with respect to its orbital motion we measure a final @xmath45 still close to 1 .",
    "the surface brightness profiles remain close to exponential ( figure 1 ) , although with a smaller scale - length ( typically by a factor of @xmath51 ) .",
    "the remnants of hsbs exhibit a more pronounced steepening of the profile inside @xmath46 because stars more efficiently lose angular momentum due to the strong bar instability .",
    "a from this set of more than 40 runs a clear trend emerges : _ lsbs evolve into objects resembling dsphs while hsbs transmute into des_.      dwarf irregular galaxies have in general extended gaseous disks with an average total hi - to - stellar mass ratio larger than one ( hoffman et al . 1996 ) : however , within the optical radius ( @xmath19 3 @xmath31 ) , the neutral hydrogen fraction often drops to only @xmath52 of the stellar mass ( jobin & carignan 1990 ; cote et al .",
    "in some of our model galaxies we include a gaseous disk of 20,000 particles which only extends out to the radius of the stellar disk ( material lying outside this radius is entirely stripped according to the collisionless runs ) and whose mass is 30% of the total baryonic mass ( the gas density drops to zero at a radius @xmath53 to mimic the `` holes '' found in many dirrs ) .",
    "the dynamics of gas are implemented using an sph scheme and radiative cooling for a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium ( wadsley et al .",
    "the initial temperature of the gas is set at 5000 k.    = 8truecm    we place an lsb satellite ( model m2la ) on a 9:1 orbit : @xmath54 of the gas is stripped after two pericenter passages and is never reaccreted , while the rest is torqued by the weak bar and gradually flows to the center : the surface density profile of the gas bound to the system steepens remarkably at each pericenter passage due to tidal compression and torques .",
    "we then use the kennicutt s law ( kennicutt 1998 ) to determine the star formation rate from the gas surface density .",
    "we also take into account the reduction of the gas mass as it is converted into stars .",
    "the resulting star formation history has two main peaks roughly separated by the orbital time of the dwarf ( @xmath55 gyr ) ( figure 4 ) , as recently found for leo i and carina ( hernandez et al . 2000 ) .",
    "after 10 gyr the star formation is suppressed because of gas consumption .",
    "the stronger bar instability in an hsb ( model m2h ) placed on the same orbit funnels more than @xmath56 of the gas to the center at the first pericentric passage , giving rise to a starburst ten times stronger than the bursts in the lsb and using up all the gas in @xmath51 gyr . as the strength of the bar instability seems to determine the type of star formation history , including gas in the gr8 model would lead to a result qualitatively similar to that of the hsb .",
    "interestingly , in the lg both the des and the extreme dsphs like draco and ursa minor formed the bulk of their stellar population during a single early episode ( ma98 : gr99 ) .",
    "finally we convolve the star formation history with the passive luminosity evolution of the stellar component resulting from population synthesis models ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) for low - metallicity systems ( 1/4 of the solar value ) .",
    "the multiple bursts are modeled as decreasing exponential laws with amplitude and time constants constrained by the numerical results .",
    "the resulting total b band luminosities and stellar mass - to - light ratios of the final remnants are in good agreement with those of observed dsphs .",
    "figure 5 summarizes the main observable properties of the simulated satellites projecting them on the fundamental plane ( fb94 ) .",
    "the remnants of lsb satellites resemble dsphs like fornax or sagittarius ( @xmath57 ) , while hsbs transform in the bright des ( @xmath58 ) , having a final central surface brightness higher than that of observed dirrs with the same luminosities and therefore matching another observational constraint ( fb94;ma98 ) .",
    "the total ( including dark matter ) final mass - to - light ratios are in the range @xmath59 .",
    "remarkably , our model can reproduce the properties of even the most extreme dsphs , draco and ursa minor .",
    "in fact , as the dark matter halo of gr8 is barely affected by tides ( figure 1 ) , the remnant ( @xmath60 ) has a final mass - to - light ratio still @xmath61 and the central dark matter density is still around @xmath62 pc@xmath63 , matching the structural parameters inferred for draco and ursa minor ( ma98 ) .      `` tidal stirring '' naturally leads to the spatial segregation of dirrs versus dsph as its effectiveness depends strongly on the distance from the primary .",
    "how important is our assumption of a massive and extended dark matter halo surrounding the milky way ?",
    "when we adopt a `` minimal '' dark halo truncated at 50 kpc ( with mass @xmath64 ; little & tremaine 1987 ) , tides are too weak and the final remnants are still rotationally flattened ( @xmath65 ) . instead , within a halo as massive and extended as implied by theories of galaxy formation ( peebles 1989 ) , our dirrs models transform into dsphs even on orbits with apocenters larger than 200 kpc , explaining the origin of even the farthest dsphs as leo i and leo ii .    though rather speculative at this stage , it is tempting to relate hsb satellites observed during the strong bursting phase to the population of blue compact dwarfs identified by guzmn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) at intermediate redshift .",
    "redshift surveys will establish if bursting dwarfs have nearby massive companions .",
    "extended tidal streams of stars originate from our simulated dwarfs ( fig .",
    "2 ) with a maximum surface brightness of just 30 mag arcsec@xmath26 ( b band ) .",
    "spectroscopic evidence for stellar streams from the dsph carina has been recently claimed ( majewski et al .",
    "future astrometric missions , like sim and gaia ( gilmore et al .",
    "1998 ; helmi et should reveal such faint features and will also carry out high - quality measurements of proper motions for many satellites of the milky way , thus providing a test for the orbital configurations used in this model .",
    "our model successfully explains the origin of dsphs once all observational constraints are taken into account : they evolved from dirrs that entered the halo of the milky way or m31 several gyr ago moving on plunging orbits and suffered stirring by the tidal field of the large spirals ."
