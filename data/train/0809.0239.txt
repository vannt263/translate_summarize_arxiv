    "chaotic transport arises naturally in hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space .",
    "achieving the control of these systems by restoring local conserved quantities is a long standing and crucial problem in many branches of physics ( in particular , in plasma physics and fluid dynamics ) .",
    "a method for controlling continuous hamiltonian flows has been developed based on the following idea : to find a small control term @xmath0 for the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is integrable ) , in order to have a more regular dynamics for the controlled hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "two approaches have been developed  : a global control aims at making the controlled hamiltonian @xmath4 integrable ; a local control restores a particular invariant torus ( local integrability ) .",
    "both approaches give a control term of order @xmath5 .",
    "let us stress that this method of control differs from other methods by the fact that the controlled dynamics is hamiltonian : this makes it relevant to the control of inherently hamiltonian systems such as beams of charged test particles in electrostatic waves , two - dimensional euler flows or the geometry of magnetic field lines .",
    "these two control methods have been developed for continuous time flows  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the global control for symplectic maps has been proposed . in this article",
    ", we explicit the local control method for symplectic maps .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we derive the expression of the control term for area - preserving maps generated by a generating function in mixed coordinates . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we apply the local control of area - preserving maps to two examples  : the standard map and the tokamap .",
    "we consider two - dimensional symplectic maps @xmath6 on the cylinder @xmath7 which are @xmath8-close to integrability  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "our aim is to find a small control term @xmath0 such that the controlled symplectic map @xmath9 has an invariant curve .",
    "we consider area - preserving maps obtained from a generating function of the form @xmath10 the map reads @xmath11 here @xmath12 denotes the partial derivative of @xmath13 with respect to the action ( first variable ) and @xmath14 denotes the partial derivative of @xmath13 with respect to the angle ( second variable ) .",
    "we expand the map around a given value of the action denoted @xmath15 .",
    "the generating function after the translation is  : @xmath16 we rewrite the generating function as  : @xmath17 where @xmath18 we notice that @xmath19 for all @xmath20 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath21 . our aim is to modify the generating function with a control term @xmath0 of order @xmath22 such that the controlled map has an invariant curve around @xmath23 .",
    "we consider the controlled generating function @xmath24 where we notice that the control term @xmath0 we construct does only depend on the angle @xmath25 .",
    "the controlled map is given by @xmath26    we perform a change of coordinates generated by @xmath27 which maps @xmath28 into @xmath29 , and @xmath30 into @xmath31 .",
    "the mapping becomes @xmath32 we choose the function @xmath33 such that @xmath34 by expanding @xmath35 in fourier series , i.e.  @xmath36 , this reads @xmath37 the control term is constructed such that the mapping in the new coordinated has @xmath38 as an invariant curve . in order to do this , we define the function @xmath39 implicitly by @xmath40 the angle @xmath41 is obtained when @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sm0eq2 ] ) the expression of the control term is such that @xmath43 > from the expression of @xmath44 given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : expw ] ) , it is straightforward to check that if @xmath45 is of order @xmath8 then @xmath46 is of order @xmath22 . since @xmath47 is of order @xmath8 ( again if @xmath45 is of order @xmath8 )",
    "then @xmath48 is of order @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 is of order @xmath22 .",
    "the controlled mapping becomes @xmath50 it is straightforward to see from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pra0 ] ) that if @xmath42 then @xmath51 by definition of @xmath39 and hence @xmath38 .",
    "since we assume that the mapping is invertible , the curve @xmath38 is preserved by iteration of the map .",
    "consequently , the controlled map ( [ eqn : cmapeq1])-([eqn : cmapeq2 ] ) has the invariant curve with equation @xmath52    next , we derive an approximate control term by only keeping the order @xmath22 . the expansion of @xmath49 gives the expression of @xmath53  : @xmath54    _ remark 1 _ : if we assume that @xmath44 is only a function of the actions , the control term @xmath0 is @xmath55 where @xmath39 is defined implicitly by @xmath56 .",
    "_ remark 2 _ : if the time step of the map is equal to @xmath57 , i.e. , if we consider controlled maps generated by @xmath58 the generating function is given by @xmath59 we define the operator @xmath60 and @xmath61 as the pseudo - inverse of @xmath62 given from @xmath63 .",
    "the projector @xmath64 is defined accordingly .",
    "hence the solution for @xmath33 is @xmath65 the control term is @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "we expand the expression of the control term and we neglect the order @xmath57  : @xmath68 since @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the pseudo - inverse of @xmath72 .",
    "this expression of the control term corresponds to the one obtained by the local control of hamiltonian flows in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a phase portrait of this map for @xmath78 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm1 ] .",
    "there are no kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori ( acting as barriers in phase space ) at this value of @xmath8 ( and higher ) .",
    "the critical value of the parameter @xmath8 for which all kam tori are broken is @xmath79 .",
    "the tokamap  @xcite has been proposed as a model map for toroidal chaotic magnetic fields .",
    "it describes the motion of field lines on the poloidal section in the toroidal geometry .",
    "this symplectic map @xmath89 , where @xmath75 is the toroidal flux and @xmath25 is the poloidal angle , is generated by the function @xmath90 it reads @xmath91 where @xmath92 is called the @xmath93-profile . in our computation , we choose @xmath94 and @xmath95 . a phase portrait of this map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tok1 ] .    we select a given value @xmath15 of the action @xmath75 for the localization .",
    "the tokamap is then generated by a function @xmath96 of the form given by eq .",
