    "properties of the normal state  of high @xmath1 superconducting cuprates in the vicinity of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) are not consistent with the landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "such unusual effects as the linear dependence of the resistivity on temperature , the linear tunnelling conductivity as a function of voltage , almost frequency and temperature independent backgrounds in the raman - scattering intensity , constant thermal conductivity , and a very large nuclear relaxation time are similar in all @xmath2 based high-@xmath1 compounds .",
    "this region is usually referred to as strange metal .    in",
    "the pioneering work varma et al @xcite have proposed a marginal fermi liquid  ( mfl ) phenomenology that allowed them to describe the unusual experimental findings surprisingly well .",
    "the theory is based on the assumptions that 1 ) electrons are scattered by unknown bosonic excitations characterized by a retarded propagator @xmath3 where @xmath4 is momentum , @xmath5 is frequency and @xmath6 is temperature , 2 ) the imaginary part of this propagator has the form@xmath7where @xmath8 is the density of states per unit volume and per spin direction , and @xmath9 is a high energy cutoff .",
    "later , abrahams and varma @xcite have demonstrated that the marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) assumption described results of angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite very well , too ( see , also ref . ) .    in spite of the evident success in describing the experiments gurvitch , iye , ando , albenque , cooper , the final agreement on the origin of the bosonic mode specified by eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) seems to be lacking so far .",
    "the strange metal behavior is attributed to quite different phenomena like , e.g. , existence of spontaneous orbital currents @xcite , quantum criticality near antiferromagnetic transition @xcite and many others .    a recent discovery of the charge modulation in cuprates julien , ghiringhelli , chang , achkar , sebastian , leboeuf , blackburn , cominstm signals a competition between the superconductivity and a charge density wave ( cdw ) in the pseudogap region of the phase diagram of cuprates .",
    "many important experimental findings of these works can be explained emp , sachdev13a , mepe , hayward , wang in the framework of the so - called spin - fermion ( sf ) model introduced earlier @xcite for description of electron - electron interaction in the vicinity of qcp .",
    "in particular , it has been proposed in ref . that the pseudogap ( pg ) state arises as a consequence of the competition between the superconducting and a charge modulated state .    experimentally , increasing the temperature and doping one passes from the pseudogap state to a strange metal state described by the mfl phenomenology .",
    "assuming that the pseudogap state can be understood in terms of the sfmodel it is natural to use this model also for description of the neighboring  strange metal state .",
    "however , the correlation function of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations used in the sf model is definitely different from the one given by eq .",

    "( [ a1 ] ) , can nevertheless be derived from the sf model for the antiferromagnet - normal metal quantum phase transition in 2d .",
    "however , in order to achieve this goal one should introduce into the model a disorder reducing the antiferromagnetic correlations at large distances .",
    "it is argued that such a disorder is intrinsically present due to doping and , being sufficiently smooth , does not contribute to the residual resistivity .",
