    "the most important physical observable for probing the thermal , dynamic , and magnetic properties of stellar atmospheres is the emerging radiation . aside from its intensity",
    ", the radiation is characterized by a given polarization state , which contains crucial information about the magnetic fields present in the atmosphere . although the magnetic field is known to play a key role in the atmosphere of the sun and other stars , our empirical knowledge of its intensity and orientation is still largely unsatisfactory , and basically limited to the deepest layers ( the photosphere ) .",
    "this explains the importance of developing new techniques for magnetic field diagnostics , based on the accurate measurement and interpretation of the polarization properties of the radiation field .",
    "each line of the solar spectrum gives information on the physical properties of the solar atmosphere at a certain height range , depending on the opacity of the atmosphere at the frequency of the line in question .",
    "as examples , the sr  i line at 4607   can be used to obtain information on the sun s photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the lower chromosphere can be studied via the sr  ii line at 4078   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interpreting these stokes profiles requires solving a radiative transfer problem out of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) , which becomes more complex if , besides the well - known zeeman effect , we wish to model the impact of scattering polarization and its modification due to the presence of a magnetic field ( hanle effect ) .",
    "a solid theory for the generation and transfer of polarized radiation , based on a first - order perturbative expansion of the atom - radiation interaction within the framework of quantum electrodynamics , is today available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ll04 ) . within this theory ,",
    "the scattering of a photon , which is intrinsically a second - order process , is described as a temporal succession of independent absorption and re - emission processes ( markov approximation ) .",
    "this case , generally referred to as the limit of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) is strictly correct either when collisions are extremely efficient in relaxing any possible correlation between the frequencies of the incoming and outgoing photons , or when the pumping field is spectrally flat ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "nonetheless , it can be shown that even when the above - mentioned conditions are not strictly verified , the limit of crd represents in any case a suitable approximation for modeling the center of the spectral lines , where the hanle effect takes place .",
    "this theory , on the other hand , turns out to be unsuitable to model the wings of strong spectral lines , where coherent scattering and partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) effects play a fundamental role .",
    "different theoretical approaches suitable to describe coherent scattering processes have been proposed during the last years .",
    "one is based on the kramers - heisenberg scattering formula .",
    "this approach was initially proposed by @xcite , and it has been recently extended to increasingly complex atomic models in the presence of arbitrary magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another approach , also suitable to describe complex atomic models in the presence of arbitrary magnetic fields , is based on the heuristic idea of metalevels ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a new quantum mechanical approach , capable of considering higher - order processes through a diagrammatic treatment of the atom - radiation interaction , has been recently proposed by @xcite.the coherency of scattering can be relaxed through two different physical mechanisms : the doppler effect and collisional processes .",
    "doppler redistribution must always be considered when going from the atomic frame to the observer s one .",
    "its inclusion in the above - mentioned approaches does not present particular difficulties from the theoretical point of view , although it leads to rather complex mathematical expressions . on the contrary",
    ", the generalization of these approaches so to include collisional processes is not trivial , and it is still under investigation .",
    "a theoretical approach based on a perturbative expansion of the atom - radiation interaction , which includes collisional redistribution , has been proposed by @xcite for the case of a two - level atom .",
    "this approach , which is based on the redistribution matrix formalism , is the starting point of our work .",
    "we consider a two - level model atom with an unpolarized and infinitely sharp lower level .",
    "this atomic model is not only of academic interest , but is suitable to model various strong resonance lines of diagnost relevance , such as the sr  i line at 4607   , or the ca  i line at 4227   .",
    "indeed , we observe that the lower levels of these lines , having total angular momenta @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , can not be polarized ( in particular , they can not carry atomic alignment ) by definition can be polarized ( they can carry atomic orientation ) if the incident radiation is circularly polarized . in this work ,",
    "we asume that collisional depolarization is always sufficiently strong so to destroy any atomic orientation that might be induced in the ( long - lived ) lower level of these resonance lines ] . moreover , these levels are the ground levels of the corresponding atomic species , so that the assumption that they are infinitely sharp is a very good approximation .    in this work the solar atmosphere is modeled as one - dimensional , static , and plane - parallel . though considering the atmosphere as dynamic and three - dimensional is a much more realistic treatment for the generation and transfer of polarized radiation , the approach presented here is a suitable first step , in which much faster calculations can be performed , yielding many insights into the physical mechanisms involved .    in sect .",
    "[ sec_form ] , we present the starting equations , written in the atomic reference frame , with the quantization axis directed along the magnetic field , and we discuss their transformation into an arbitrary reference frame . obtaining the emergent intensity and polarization requires finding the self - consistent solution of the statistical equilibrium ( se ) equations for the atomic state , and of the radiative transfer ( rt ) equations .",
    "this is done through an iterative method that is described in sect .",
    "[ sec_iter ] , together with the numerical tools that have been developed and implemented , considering the particular characteristics of the problem under investigation .",
    "when prd phenomena are taken into account , the emitted radiation at a given frequency does not depend only on the incoming radiation at that specific frequency ( as would happen for coherent scattering ) , nor does it depend on a frequency - averaged radiation field ( as in crd ) . in consequence ,",
    "the iterative scheme has to consider that all frequencies are coupled to one another in the scattering process .",

    "the intensity is greater at line center when using the crd approximation than when prd is considered .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood as follows . in the limit of crd",
    "the scattered radiation at a given frequency depends on a weighted average of the incoming radiation over the whole line profile , and it thus takes into account that , for an absorption line , the intensity increases going from the core to the wings . on the contrary , in the limit of cs",

    "prd phenomena relax such coherency , relating the scattering radiation to the incoming one , but over an interval that is generally smaller than the one considered in the crd case .",

    "the same behavior can be seen when comparing prd and crd calculations of the fractional linear polarization @xmath206 profiles .",
    "[ stokesfig1 ] clearly shows that the difference between crd and prd calculations is , as expected , rather small in the sr  i 4607   line .",

    "the results shown for this line are in agreement with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "although the sr  i line at 4607   forms in the photosphere , where the density of neutral hydrogen ( the main responsible for elastic collisions ) is rather high , at the line center and for a line - of - sight with @xmath230 , the coherence fraction @xmath94 is 0.624 , which means that @xmath111 still represents the dominant contribution . the good agreement between prd and crd calculations is due to the fact that this is medium / weak spectral line without extended wings outside the doppler core .",
    "indeed , it has to be recalled that when doppler redistribution is taken into account , the emergent profiles produced by @xmath111 and @xmath125 in the line core are very similar ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed discussion of the behavior of the two redistribution functions depending on the optical thickness of a spectral line in the core and in the wings can be found in @xcite .    the sr  ii @xmath200   line forms much higher in the atmosphere , where the density of perturbers is noticeably lower",

    "the contribution of @xmath111 thus largely dominates in the core . in this region , however , the crd limit still provides a rather good approximation since , as previously pointed out , @xmath111 and @xmath125 produce similar emergent profiles once doppler redistribution is taken into account . unlike the sr  i @xmath219   line , this line presents very extended wings outside the doppler core , where the optical thickness remains considerable . in this region ,",
    "the two redistribution functions have a different behavior , and they give rise to emergent polarization profiles very different from one another .",
    "it has to be noticed that the difference between the crd and prd @xmath206 profiles remains significant in the near wings also at wavelengths where the contribution of @xmath111 is no longer the dominant one ( see the coherence fraction at frequency point c ) .",
    "the three peak structure found in stokes @xmath206 , with a small dip in the central one , is characteristic of coherent scattering and can not be found in the crd limit .",
    "notice also that for both lines considered in the figure , there is a non - zero @xmath206 profile in the far wings which is produced by continuum scattering .",
    "when the magnetic field is not too strong ( e.g. , outside sunspots ) , the splitting of the magnetic sublevels due to the zeeman effect is generally much smaller than the doppler width of the line . under this circumstance ,",
    "it is customary to neglect the zeeman splitting of the energy levels in the emission and absorption profiles , as this leads to a significant simplification of the problem . under this assumption , which is generally referred to as the weak - field approximation",

    "for the same reason , @xmath0 is zero in this case ( see the following section ) . at line center ,",
    "the polarization in both cases is identical up to 50 g , and there is a very small discrepancy at 100 g due to a small contribution from the zeeman effect .",
    "in the wings , however , a clear magnetic depolarization can be observed when the weak field approximation is considered .",
    "this is an artificial effect caused by the fact that we are neglecting the zeeman splitting in the emission profile , and so the hanle depolarization factor no longer cancels the magnetic field dependence in the wings ( see sect .",
    "10.4 of ll04 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "it is important to note that , though the weak field approximation is reliable in the line core ( as long as the conditions for its validity are met ) , when there are extended polarization signals in the wing - as often occurs when considering the effects of prd on modeling strong resonant lines - one must be cautious in considering the effects of the magnetic field with this approximation .",
    "the results for stronger fields are not shown because when zeeman splitting is neglected there is no change in the polarization profiles once we have reached hanle saturation .",
    "we consider now the emergent @xmath206 and @xmath1 profiles of the sr  ii line at 4078   , calculated for a los with @xmath230 , in the presence of a magnetic field with @xmath198 and @xmath237 ( i.e. , a magnetic field almost longitudinal for the considered los ) .        as can be observed in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ stokesfig3 ] , weak magnetic fields , even considerably below the hanle critical field , produce a clear depolarization of the wings of the calculated @xmath206 profiles , and give rise to positive lobes in the wings of the @xmath1 profiles .",
    "these effects become larger and extend further out into the line wings as the field strength grows . at first glance",
    ", this magnetic sensitivity of the line wings may appear surprising , as we know that the hanle effect vanishes in the wings , and the contribution of the zeeman effect to @xmath238 and @xmath239 is expected to be negligible for these field strengths .",
    "indeed , this magnetic sensitivity has nothing to do with such effects , but it is a magneto - optical effect , due to the term @xmath0 . as it is clear from eq .  , this term couples @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and produces a rotation of the plane of linear polarization as the radiation propagates through the atmospheric material ( faraday rotation ) .",
    "we recall that in the absence of lower level polarization ( as in our case ) , @xmath0 is zero unless a magnetic field with a longitudinal component is present .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 is proportional to the ( antisymmetric ) faraday - voigt profile : it is thus zero at the line center , but has very extended wings , where it can be even larger than the absorption coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "this explains why the magnetic sensitivity shown by our calculations is so clear in the line wings , while it disappears in the core of the line .",
    "our physical interpretation of this effect is clearly supported by the results obtained by neglecting the magneto - optical effects caused by the @xmath0 coefficient appearing in the propagation matrix of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . as shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ stokesfig3 ] , when @xmath0 is set to zero the line core signal shows exactly the same behavior as when this term is taken into account , while in the wings there is no depolarization at all in @xmath206 , and no signal appears in @xmath1 .",
    "it should be observed that in our calculations we have considered an almost longitudinal field , constant throughout the whole atmosphere , a scenario that is particularly suitable for the illustration of this physical effect .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in the hanle - zeeman calculation a stokes @xmath240 profile is produced , and it can be seen that it is not affected by the @xmath0 ( as can be easily deduced from eq .  [ rte ] ) . moreover , for this geometry and field strength , @xmath241 and @xmath242 are too weak to produce any appreciable change in the emerging circular polarization ( see fig .",

    "such profiles can not be found in the limit of crd , which however keeps representing a quite good approximation for modeling the line - center amplitude of both intensity and scattering polarization signals . while in the atomic reference frame",
    "coherent scattering effects play an important role also in the line center , in the observer s frame the effects of doppler redistribution cause the crd approximation to be suitable to estimate the polarization at the line center .",

    "<S> the spectral line polarization encodes a wealth of information about the thermal and magnetic properties of the solar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> modeling the stokes profiles of strong resonance lines is , however , a complex problem both from the theoretical and computational point of view , especially when partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) effects need to be taken into account . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we consider a two - level atom in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary intensity ( hanle - zeeman regime ) and orientation , both deterministic and micro - structured . </S>",
    "<S> working within the framework of a rigorous prd theoretical approach , we have developed a numerical code which solves the full non - lte radiative transfer problem for polarized radiation , in one - dimensional models of the solar atmosphere , accounting for the combined action of the hanle and zeeman effects , as well as for prd phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> after briefly discussing the relevant equations , we describe the iterative method of solution of the problem and the numerical tools that we have developed and implemented . </S>",
    "<S> we finally present some illustrative applications to two resonance lines that form at different heights in the solar atmosphere , and provide a detailed physical interpretation of the calculated stokes profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in strong resonance lines sensitive to prd effects the magneto - optical @xmath0 terms of the stokes - vector transfer equation produce conspicuous @xmath1 wing signals along with a very interesting magnetic sensitivity in the wings of the linear polarization profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the weak - field approximation has to be used with caution when prd effects are considered . </S>"
