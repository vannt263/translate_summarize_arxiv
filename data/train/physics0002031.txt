    "path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations are useful for extracting exact results on many - body quantum systems @xcite . in principle , pimc methods can be used to study both equilibrium as well as dynamical problems .",
    "but in the cases of fermions and real - time dynamics , pimc suffers from the notorious `` sign problem '' which renders such simulations unstable .",
    "this sign problem manifests itself as an exponential decay of the signal - to - noise ratio for large systems or long real times @xcite .",
    "its origin is at the heart of quantum mechanics itself , namely the interference of different quantum paths contributing to the path integral might be destructive due to exchange effects or due to the oscillatory nature of the real - time evolution operator . besides approximate treatments @xcite the sign problem has remained unsolved .",
    "very recently , a new strategy has been proposed as a possible approach to a complete solution of the sign problem .",
    "this so - called multi - level blocking ( mlb ) algorithm @xcite is a systematic implementation of the simple blocking idea  by sampling `` blocks '' instead of single paths , one can _ always _ reduce the sign problem @xcite . defining a suitable hierarchy of blocks by grouping them into different `` levels '' , crucial information about the phase cancellations among different quantum paths can then be recursively transferred from the bottom to the top level . given sufficient computer memory , such an approach was shown to be able to eliminate the sign problem in a stable and exact manner @xcite . but to date , the mlb algorithm has only been formulated to solve the sign problem in pimc simulations with nearest - neighbor interactions along the trotter direction .",
    "this situation is encountered under a direct trotter - suzuki breakup of the short - time propagator .    in this paper , we report an extension of the mlb approach to the case of effective actions that may include arbitrarily long - ranged interactions",
    ". such effective actions that are non - local in trotter time may arise from degrees of freedoms having been traced out , e.g. , a harmonic heat bath @xcite , or through a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , e.g. , in auxiliary - field mc simulations of lattice fermions @xcite .",
    "remarkably , because such effective actions capture much of the physics , e.g. , symmetries or the dissipative influence of the traced - out degrees of freedom , the corresponding path integral very often exhibits a significantly reduced `` intrinsic '' sign problem compared to the original ( time - local ) formulation .",
    "the present generalization of the mlb algorithm was developed to take advantage of this fact .",
    "we note that in a pimc simulation with only nearest - neighbor interactions along the trotter direction , the original mlb approach @xcite is more efficient than the method described below , which therefore should be used only for time - non - local actions .",
    "to be specific , we focus on the dynamical sign problem arising in real - time pimc computations here . the modifications required to implement the method for fermion simulations are then straightforward .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ gen ] the general strategy to deal with long - ranged interactions in a mlb scheme is outlined .",
    "a detailed exposition of the computational method can be found in sec .",
    "[ mlbsim ] .",
    "we have studied the real - time dynamics of the celebrated spin - boson system @xcite using this approach .",
    "details about this application , performance issues related to the sign problem , and numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ spinboson ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ conc ] offers some conclusions .",
    "we consider a discretized path integral along a certain contour in the complex - time plane . in a typical real - time calculation , there is a forward branch from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the maximum time studied in the simulation , followed by a branch going back to the origin , and then by an imaginary - time branch from @xmath0 to @xmath3 .",
    "we focus on a `` factorized '' initial preparation where the relevant degrees of freedom , denoted by @xmath4 , are held fixed for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "that implies that the imaginary - time dynamics must be frozen at the corresponding value , and we only need to sample on the two real - time branches .",
    "note that such a nonequilibrium calculation can not proceed in a standard way by first doing an imaginary - time qmc simulation followed by analytic continuation of the numerical data @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath4 at a given time may be discrete or continuous variables .    using time slices of length @xmath6 , we combine forward [ @xmath7 and backward [ @xmath8 path configurations at time @xmath9 into the configuration @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "the configuration at @xmath0 is held fixed , and for @xmath1 we must be in a diagonal state , @xmath12 . for an efficient application of the current method , it is essential to combine several neighboring slices @xmath13 into new `` blocks '' .",
    "for instance , think of @xmath14 as a new `` slice '' @xmath15 , @xmath16 as another slice @xmath17 , and so on . combining @xmath18 elementary slices into a block @xmath19 , instead of the original @xmath20 slices we have @xmath21 blocks , where @xmath22 is the number of mlb `` levels '' . in actual applications",
    ", there is considerable freedom in how these blocks are defined , e.g. if there is hardly any intrinsic sign problem , or if there are only few variables in @xmath23 , one may choose larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "additional flexibility can be gained by choosing different @xmath18 for different blocks .",
    "say we are interested in sampling the configurations @xmath24 on the top level @xmath25 according to the appropriate matrix elements of the ( reduced ) density matrix , @xmath26 \\ } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the effective action under study and @xmath28 is a normalization constant so that @xmath29 due to the time - non - locality of this action , there will be interactions among all blocks @xmath19 .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) denotes either an integration over continuous degrees of freedom or a discrete sum . in the case of interest here ,",
    "the effective action is complex - valued and @xmath30 represents an oscillatory phase factor ( @xmath31 for the fermion sign problem ) .",
    "the `` naive approach '' to the sign problem is to sample configurations using the positive definite weight function @xmath32 and to include the oscillatory phase in the accumulation procedure .",
    "precisely this leads to the exponentially fast decay of the signal - to - noise ratio with @xmath2 .",
    "the proposed mlb simulation scheme starts by sampling on the finest level @xmath15 , so only variables in the first block corresponding to @xmath33 are updated . during this procedure ,",
    "interference among different paths will take place .",
    "since only relatively few degrees of freedom are sampled , however , the resulting interference information can be quantified in a controlled way by employing so - called `` level-@xmath34 bonds '' ( here @xmath15 ) . as long as @xmath18 is chosen sufficiently small",
    ", the interference can not lead to numerical instabilities , and the sign cancellations occuring while sampling on level @xmath15 can thus be synthesized and transferred to the level @xmath17 , where the sampling is carried out next . here",
    "the procedure is repeated , and by proceeding recursively up to the top level @xmath25 , this strategy can eliminate the sign problem .",
    "the main bottleneck of the method comes from the immense memory requirements , since one needs to store and update the level-@xmath34 bonds on all levels during the monte carlo sampling ( see below for details ) . to summarize , the main idea of our approach is to subdivide the allowed interferences among the quantum paths into small subunits ( blocks ) such that no sign problem occurs when ( stochastically ) summing over the paths within each subunit .",
    "the basic observation underlying our method is therefore almost trivial : the sign problem does not occur in a sufficiently small system .",
    "the nontrivial computational task then consists of bringing together the interference signals from different blocks , which is done by recursively forming blocks on subsequent higher levels .    instead of the `` circular '' structure of the time contour inherent in the trace operation , it is actually more helpful to view the problem as a linear chain , where the proposed mlb scheme proceeds from left to right . in the case of local actions with only nearest - neighbor interactions along trotter time ,",
    "a different recursion scheme was implemented in refs.@xcite which is close in spirit to the usual block - spin transformations used in renormalization group treatments of spin chains . for both mlb implementations , however , the underlying blocking idea is identical , and the non - locality of the effective action studied here only requires one to abandon block - spin - like transformations in favor of the `` moving - along - the - chain '' picture .",
    "below we assume that one can decompose the effective action according to @xmath35   = \\sum_{\\ell=1}^l w_\\ell[\\bbox{s}_\\ell,\\ldots,\\bbox{s}_l ] \\;.\\ ] ] all dependence on a configuration @xmath19 is then contained in the `` partial actions '' @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "one could , of course , put all @xmath38 , but the approach becomes more powerful if a nontrivial decomposition is possible .",
    "in the following , we describe in detail how the mlb algorithm for effective actions is implemented in practice .",
    "the mc sampling starts on the finest level @xmath15 , where only the configuration @xmath39 containing the elementary slices @xmath33 will be updated with all @xmath40 remaining fixed at their initial values @xmath41 . using the weight function @xmath42 =   |\\exp\\{-w_1[\\bbox{s}_1 , \\bbox{s}_2 ^ 0 , \\ldots , \\bbox{s}_l^0]\\}| \\;,\\ ] ]",

    "for @xmath46 , the algorithm simply reproduces the naive approach .",

    "such coherence effects can then strongly influence the low - temperature dynamics .",

    ", we have focussed on real - time simulations here , but believe that a similar approach can also be helpful in many - fermion computations , e.g. , in auxiliary - field fermion simulations of lattice fermions .",
    "the practical usefulness of the approach was demonstrated by computing the nonequilibrium real - time dynamics of the dissipative two - state system . here",
    "the effective action ( influence functional ) arises by integrating out the linear heat bath . for a heat bath of the ohmic type , at @xmath124 the corresponding interactions among different time slices decay only with a slow inverse - square power law .    in the present implementation of mlb , the basic blocking idea operates on multiple time scales by carrying out a subsequent sampling at longer and longer times . during this procedure ,",
    "the interference information collected at shorter times is taken fully into account without invoking any approximation .",
    "under such an approach , at the expense of large memory requirements , the severity of the sign problem can be significantly relieved .",
