    "preferential attachment random graphs are randomgraphs that evolve by sequentially adding vertices and edges in a random way so that connections to vertices with high degree are favored .",
    "particular versions of these models were proposed by @xcite as a mechanism to explain the appearance of the so - called power law behavior observed in some real world networks ; for example , the graph derived from the world wide web by considering webpages as vertices and hyperlinks between them as edges .    following the publication of @xcite , there has been an explosion of research surrounding these ( and other ) random growth models .",
    "this work is largely motivated by the idea that many real world data structures can be captured in the language of networks [ see @xcite for a wide survey from this point of view ] .",
    "however , much of this work is experimental or empirical and , by comparison , the rigorous mathematical literature on these models is less developed [ see @xcite for a recent review ] .    for preferential attachment models ,",
    "the seminal reference in the mathematics literature is @xcite , in which one of the main results is a rigorous proof that the degree of a randomly chosen vertex in a particular family of preferential attachment random graph models converges to the yule ",
    "simon distribution .",
    "corresponding approximation results in total variation for this and related preferential attachment models can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we study the distribution of the degree of a fixed vertex in two preferential attachment models . in model",
    "1 we start with a graph @xmath0 with two vertices labeled one and two with an edge directed from vertex two to vertex one .",
    "given graph @xmath1 , graph @xmath2 is obtained by adding a vertex labeled @xmath3 and adding a single directed edge from this new vertex to a vertex labeled from the set @xmath4 , where the chance that @xmath3 connects to vertex @xmath5 is proportional to the degree of vertex @xmath5 in @xmath1 ( here and below degree means in - degree plus out - degree ) .",
    "model  2 is one studied in @xcite and allows for self - connecting edges .",
    "there , we start with a graph @xmath6 with a single vertex labeled one and with an edge directed from vertex one to itself . given graph @xmath1 , graph @xmath2",
    "is obtained by adding a vertex labeled @xmath3 and adding a single directed edge from this new vertex to a vertex labeled from the set @xmath7 , where the chance that @xmath3 connects to vertex @xmath8 is proportional to the degree of vertex @xmath5 in @xmath1 ( a loop at a vertex contributes two to its degree ) and the chance that vertex @xmath3 connects to itself is @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the degree of vertex @xmath5 in @xmath1 under either of the models above .",
    "our main result is a rate of convergence in the kolmogorov metric ( defined below ) of @xmath11 to its distributional limit as @xmath12 .",
    "although the literature on these models is large , there is surprisingly little known about these distributions .",
    "the fact that these limits exist for the first model has been shown by @xcite and @xcite and the same result for both models can be read from @xcite by relation to a generalized plya urn , although the existing descriptions of the limits are not very explicit . a further related result from @xcite ( and",
    "the only main result there having bearing on our work here ) is that for large @xmath5 , the distribution of @xmath10 is approximately geometric with parameter @xmath13 , with the error in the approximation going to zero as @xmath14 . thus it can be seen that if @xmath15 and @xmath14 , then the distribution of @xmath16 converges to a rate one exponential ; cf . proposition  [ prop3](iii ) below .    the primary tool we use here to characterize the limits and",
    "obtain rates of convergence is a new distributional transformation for which the limit distributions are the unique fixed points .",
    "this transformation allows us to develop a new variation of stein s method ; we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for introductions to stein s method .    to formulate our main result we first define the family of densities @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the gamma function and @xmath19 denotes the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind ( also known as the kummer @xmath20 function ) [ see @xcite , chapter 13 ] .",
    "propositions  [ prop1 ] and  [ prop3 ] below imply that @xmath21 is indeed a density for @xmath22 and we denote by @xmath23 the distribution function defined by the density  @xmath21 .",

    "theorem  [ thm1 ] will follow from a more general result derived by developing stein s method for the distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the key ingredient to our framework follows from observing that @xmath23 is a fixed point of a certain distributional transformation which we will refer to as the `` @xmath38-transformed double size bias '' ( @xmath38-tdsb ) transformation , which we now describe .",
    "recall for a nonnegative random variable @xmath39 having finite mean we say @xmath40 has the _ size bias distribution _ of @xmath39 if @xmath41 for all @xmath42 such that @xmath43 [ see @xcite and @xcite for surveys and applications of size biasing ] . if in addition @xmath39 has finite second moment , then we will write @xmath44 to denote a random variable having the size bias distribution of @xmath40 .",
    "alternatively we say @xmath44 has the _",
    "double size bias distribution _ of @xmath39 and it is straightforward to check that @xmath45 although not used below , it is also appropriate to say that @xmath44 has the _ square bias distribution _ of @xmath39 since ( [ ] ) 2 implies that we are biasing @xmath39 against its square . this terminology is used in @xcite and @xcite albeit under a different notation .",
    "now , we have the following key definition .    [ def1 ] for fixed @xmath22 let @xmath46 and  @xmath47 be two independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath48 $ ] , and let @xmath49 be a bernoulli random variable with parameter @xmath50 independent of @xmath46 and  @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath38-transformed double size biased _",
    "( @xmath38-tdsb ) distribution of @xmath39 , if @xmath53 where @xmath44 , the double size bias of @xmath39 , is assumed to be independent of  @xmath54 .",
    "our next result implies that the closer a distribution is to its @xmath38-tdsb transform , the closer it is to the @xmath23 distribution . besides the kolmogorov metric we also consider the wasserstein metric between two probability distribution functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , defined as @xmath55    [ thm2 ] let @xmath39 be a nonnegative random variable with @xmath56 and let @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath52 have the @xmath38-tdsb distribution of @xmath39 and be defined on the same probability space as @xmath39 .",
    "then if @xmath57 , @xmath59 and , for any @xmath60 , @xmath61.\\ ] ] if @xmath58 then @xmath62 and , for any @xmath60 , @xmath63.\\ ] ]    as can easily be read from the work of section  [ sec1 ] ( in particular , propositions  [ prop1 ] and  [ prop3 ] ) , the distributions @xmath23 can roughly be partitioned into three regions where similar behavior within the range can be expected : @xmath58 , @xmath64 and @xmath57 .",
    "the theorem only covers the first and last cases as this is what is needed to prove theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "analogs of the results of the theorem hold in the region @xmath64 , but we have omitted them for simplicity and brevity .    from lemma  [ lem12 ] below and the fact that for @xmath65 with bounded derivative @xmath66 we see that for @xmath57 or @xmath58 and all @xmath67 , @xmath68 choosing @xmath69 yields @xmath70 thus we can obtain bounds in the kolmogorov metric if @xmath71 is appropriately bounded with high probability or in expectation .    [ rem1 ] it follows from lemmas  [ lem5 ] and  [ lem15 ] below that @xmath72 if and only if @xmath73 .",
    "in the case that @xmath74 , @xmath54 is uniform on @xmath75 and proposition  [ prop3 ] below implies that @xmath36 is distributed as the absolute value of a standard normal random variable .",
    "thus we obtain the interesting fact that @xmath76 for @xmath20 uniform @xmath75 and independent of @xmath44 if and only if @xmath39 is distributed as the absolute value of a standard normal variable .",
    "this fact can also be read from its analog for the standard normal distribution [ @xcite , proposition 2.3 ] : @xmath77 for @xmath78 uniform @xmath79 and independent of @xmath80 if and only if @xmath39 has the standard normal distribution [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "although there are general formulations for developing stein s method machinery for a given distribution [ see @xcite ] , our framework below does not adhere to any of these directly since the characterizing operator we use is a second order differential operator [ see ( [ ] ) 23 and ( [ ] ) 25 below ] . for the distribution @xmath23 , the usual first order stein operator derived from the density approach of @xcite [ following @xcite ] is a complicated expression involving special functions .",
    "however , by composing this more canonical operator with an appropriate first order operator , we are able to derive a second order stein operator ( see lemma [ lem7 ] below ) which has a form that is amenable to our analysis",
    ". this strategy may be useful for other distributions which have first order operators that are difficult to handle .",
    "the usual approach to developing stein s method is to decide on the distribution of interest , find a corresponding stein operator and then derive couplings from it .",
    "the operator we use here was suggested by the @xmath38-tdsb transform which in turn arose from the discovery of a close coupling in the preferential attachment application .",
    "we believe this approach of using couplings to suggest a stein operator is a potentially fruitful new strategy for extending stein s method to new distributions and applications .    there have been several previous developments of stein s method using fixed points of distributional transformations .",
    "@xcite develop stein s method using the zero - bias transformation for which the normal distribution is a fixed point .",
    "letting @xmath20 be a uniform @xmath75 random variable independent of all else , @xcite and @xcite develop stein s method for the exponential distribution using the fact that @xmath39 and @xmath81 have the same distribution if and only if @xmath39 has an exponential distribution [ @xcite and @xcite also use this property ] .",
    "we will show below that @xmath39 and @xmath82 have the same distribution if and only if @xmath39 is distributed as the absolute value of a standard normal random variable ( see also remark  [ rem1 ] above ) . in this light",
    "this paper can be viewed as extending the use of these types of distributional transformations in stein s method .",

    "we discuss various properties and alternative representations of @xmath23 , in section  [ sec2 ] we develop stein s method for @xmath23 and prove theorem  [ thm2 ] and in section  [ sec3 ] we prove theorem  [ thm1 ] by constructing the coupling needed to apply theorem  [ thm2 ] and bounding the appropriate terms .",
