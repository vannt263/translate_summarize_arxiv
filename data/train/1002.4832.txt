    "a fundamental market model was proposed by walras in 1874 @xcite .",
    "independently , fisher proposed a special case of this model in 1891 @xcite , where a market comprises of a set of buyers and divisible goods .",
    "the money possessed by buyers and the amount of each good is specified .",
    "the utility function of every buyer is also given .",
    "the market equilibrium problem is to compute prices and allocation such that every buyer gets the highest utility bundle subject to her budget constraint and that the market clears .",
    "recently , much work has been done on the computation of market equilibrium prices and allocation for various utility functions , for example @xcite .",
    "the payoff ( _ i.e. _ , happiness ) of a buyer depends on the equilibrium allocation and in turn on the utility functions and initial endowments of the buyers . a natural question to ask is , can a buyer achieve a better payoff by feigning a different utility function ?",
    "it turns out that a buyer may indeed gain by feigning !",
    "this observation motivates us to analyze the strategic behavior of buyers in the fisher market .",
    "we analyze here the linear utility case described below .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of buyers , and @xmath1 be the set of goods , and @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the money possessed by buyer @xmath4 , and @xmath5 be the total quantity of good @xmath6 in the market .",
    "the utility function of buyer @xmath4 is represented by the non - negative utility tuple @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the payoff , she derives from a unit amount of good @xmath6 .",
    "thus , if @xmath9 is the amount of good @xmath6 allocated to buyer @xmath4 , then the _ payoff _ she derives from her allocation is @xmath10 . market equilibrium or market clearing prices @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the price of good @xmath6 , and equilibrium allocation @xmath13_{i\\in\\mathcal b , j\\in\\mathcal g}$ ] satisfy the following constraints :    * * market clearing : * the demand equals the supply of each good , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 . *",
    "* optimal goods : * every buyer buys only those goods , which give her the maximum utility per unit of money , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath17 then @xmath18 .    in this market model , by scaling @xmath8 s appropriately , we may assume that the quantity of every good is one unit , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath19 .",
    "equilibrium prices are unique and the set of equilibrium allocations is a convex set @xcite .",
    "the following example illustrates a small market .",
    "[ eg1 ] consider a 2 buyers , 2 goods market with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the equilibrium prices of this market are @xmath24 and the unique equilibrium allocation is @xmath25 .",
    "the payoff of both the buyers is @xmath26 .    in the above market , does a buyer have a strategy to achieve a better payoff ?",
    "yes indeed ,",
    "buyer @xmath27 can force price change by posing a different utility tuple , and in turn gain .",
    "suppose buyer @xmath27 feigns her utility tuple as @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 , then coincidentally , the equilibrium prices @xmath30 are also @xmath31 .",
    "the unique equilibrium allocation @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "now , the payoff of buyer @xmath27 is @xmath34 , and that of buyer @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "note that the payoffs are still calculated w.r.t .",
    "the true utility tuples .",
    "this clearly shows that a buyer could gain by feigning a different utility tuple , hence the fisher market is susceptible to gaming by strategic buyers .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium prices w.r.t .",
    "the true utility tuples may not be the actual operating point of the market .",
    "the natural questions to investigate are : what are the possible operating points of this market model under strategic behavior ?",
    "can they be computed ?",
    "is there a preferred one ?",
    "this motivates us to study the nash equilibria of the _ fisher market game _ , where buyers are the players and strategies are the utility tuples that they may pose . +   + * related work . *",
    "shapley and shubik @xcite consider a market game for the exchange economy , where every good has a trading post , and the strategy of a buyer is to bid ( money ) at each trading post .",
    "for each strategy profile , the prices are determined naturally so that market clears and goods are allocated accordingly , however agents may not get the optimal bundles .",
    "many variants @xcite of this game have been extensively studied . essentially , the goal is to design a mechanism to implement walrasian equilibrium ( we ) , _ i.e. _ , to capture we at a ne of the game .",
    "the strategy space of this game is tied to the implementation of the market ( in this case , trading posts ) .",
    "our strategy space is the utility tuple itself , and is independent of the market implementation .",
    "it is not clear that bids of a buyer in the shapley - shubik game correspond to the feigned utility tuples . in word auction markets",
    "as well , a similar study on strategic behavior of buyers ( advertisers ) has been done @xcite . + * our contributions .",
    "* we formulate the fisher market game , the strategy sets and the corresponding payoff function in section [ fmg ] .",
    "every ( pure ) strategy profile defines a fisher market , and therefore market equilibrium prices and a set of equilibrium allocations .",
    "the payoff of a buyer may not be same across all equilibrium allocations w.r.t . a strategy profile , as illustrated by example [ eg2 ] in section [ fmg ] .",
    "furthermore , there may not exist an equilibrium allocation , which gives the maximum possible payoffs to all the buyers .",
    "this behavior causes a conflict of interest among buyers .",
    "a strategy profile is said to be _ conflict - free _",
    ", if there is an equilibrium allocation which gives the maximum possible payoffs to all the buyers .",
    "a strategy profile is called a nash equilibrium strategy profile _ ( nesp ) _ , if no buyer can unilaterally deviate and get a better payoff . in section [ gen ] , we show that all nesps are conflict - free . using the equilibrium prices , we associate a bipartite graph to a strategy profile and show that this graph must satisfy certain conditions when the corresponding strategy profile is a nesp .",
    "next , we define _ symmetric _ strategy profiles , where all buyers play the same strategy .",
    "we show that a symmetric strategy profile is a nesp iff it is conflict - free .",
    "it is interesting to note that a symmetric nesp can be constructed for a given market game , whose payoff is the same as the fisher payoff , _",
    "i.e. _ , payoff when all buyers play truthfully .",
    "example [ eg5 ] shows that all nesps need not be symmetric and the payoff w.r.t .",
    "a nesp need not be pareto optimal ( _ i.e. _ , efficient ) .",
    "however , the fisher payoff is always pareto optimal ( see first theorem of welfare economics @xcite ) .",
    "characterization of all the nesps seems difficult ; even for markets with only three buyers .",
    "we study two - buyer markets in section [ ne ] and the main results are :    * all nesps are symmetric and they are a union of at most @xmath37 convex sets . *",
    "the set of nesp payoffs constitute a piecewise linear concave curve and all these payoffs are pareto optimal .",
    "the strategizing on utilities has the same effect as differing initial endowments ( see second theorem of welfare economics @xcite ) .",
    "* the third - party mediation does not help in this game .",
    "some interesting observations about two - buyer markets are :    * the buyer @xmath4 gets the maximum payoff among all nash equilibrium payoffs when she imitates the other , _ i.e. _ , when they play @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the true utility tuple of the other buyer .",
    "* there may exist nesps , whose social welfare ( _ i.e. _ , sum of the payoffs of both the buyers ) is larger than that of the fisher payoff ( example [ eg6 ] ) .",
    "* for a particular payoff tuple , there is a convex set of nesps and hence convex set of equilibrium prices .",
    "this motivates a seller to offer incentives to the buyers to choose a particular nesp from this convex set , which fetches the maximum price for her good .",
    "example [ eg7 ] illustrates this behavior .",
    "most qualitative features of these markets may carry over to oligopolies , which arise in numerous scenarios .",
    "for example , relationship between a few manufacturers of aircrafts or automobiles and many suppliers .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ con_fut ] that it is highly unlikely that buyers will act according to their true utility tuples in fisher markets and discuss some directions for further research .",
    "as defined in the previous section , a linear fisher market is defined by the tuple @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a set of buyers , @xmath43 is a set of goods , @xmath44 is the true utility tuple of buyer @xmath4 , and @xmath45 is the endowment vector .",
    "we assume that @xmath46 and the quantity of every good is one unit .",
    "the _ fisher market game _ is a one - shot non - cooperative game , where the buyers are the players , and the _ strategy set _ is all possible utility tuples that they may pose , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the set of all strategy profiles is @xmath48 . when a strategy profile @xmath49 is played , where @xmath50 , we treat @xmath51 as utility tuples of buyers @xmath52 respectively , and compute the equilibrium prices and a set of equilibrium allocations w.r.t .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "further , using the equilibrium prices @xmath55 , we generate the corresponding _ solution graph _ @xmath56 as follows : let @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the node corresponding to the buyer @xmath59 and @xmath60 be the node corresponding to the good @xmath61 in @xmath56 .",
    "we place an edge between @xmath58 and @xmath60 iff @xmath62 , and call the edges of the solution graph as _ tight edges_. note that when the solution graph is a forest , there is exactly one equilibrium allocation , however this is not so , when it contains cycles . in the standard fisher market (",
    "_ i.e. _ , strategy of every buyer is her true utility tuple ) , all equilibrium allocations give the same payoff to a buyer .",
    "however , this is not so when buyers strategize on their utility tuples : different equilibrium allocations may not give the same payoff to a buyer .",
    "the following example illustrates this scenario .",
    "[ eg2 ] consider the fisher market of example [ eg1 ] .",

    "the payoffs corresponding to these allocations are @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "note that there is no allocation , which gives the maximum possible payoff to both the buyers .",

    "such an @xmath79 is called a * _ conflict - free allocation_*.    when a strategy profile @xmath49 is not conflict - free , there is a conflict of interest in selecting a particular allocation for the play .",
    "if a buyer , say @xmath80 , does not get the same payoff from all the equilibrium allocations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath81 , then we show that for every @xmath82 , there exists a strategy profile @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , such that @xmath85 ( section [ crp ] ) .",

    "then , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is a tree ; the cycle of example [ eg2 ] is broken .",
    "hence there is a unique equilibrium allocation , and @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , if a strategy profile @xmath53 is not conflict - free , then for every choice of allocation @xmath73 to decide the payoff , there is a buyer who may deviate and assure herself a better payoff .",
    "in other words , when @xmath53 is not conflict - free , there is no way to choose an allocation @xmath79 from @xmath72 acceptable to all the buyers .",
    "this suggests that only conflict - free strategies are interesting .",

    "in this section , we prove some necessary conditions for a strategy profile to be a nesp of the fisher market game defined in the previous section .",
