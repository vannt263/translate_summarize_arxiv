    "estimating the neutrino mass is one of the main challenges of cosmology today .",
    "according to the standard model of particle physics , neutrinos are weakly interacting massless particles .",
    "however , the experiments on the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos tell us that neutrinos can not be massless .",
    "oscillation experiments can only measure the differences in the squared masses of the neutrino eigenstates @xmath3 and not the absolute mass scale .",
    "the current data imply @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these measurements provide a lower limit for the sum of neutrino masses of @xmath6 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "now that cosmology has entered the `` precision era '' and the cosmological parameters can be constrained at a percent level , observations of the universe can assist in the quest for neutrino mass , since neutrinos affect the evolution of the universe in several observable ways .",
    "after thermal decoupling , relic neutrinos constitute a collisionless fluid , where the individual particles free - stream with the characteristic thermal velocity . as long as neutrinos are relativistic ,",
    "the free - streaming scale is simply the hubble radius .",
    "when they become non - relativistic , their thermal velocity decays , and the free - streaming scale is equal to @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dimensionless hubble parameter , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the cosmological constant and the matter density parameters , respectively , evaluated at @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the neutrino mass . the physical effect of free - streaming is to damp neutrino density fluctuations on scales @xmath13 , where neutrinos can not cluster due to their large thermal velocity .",
    "this affects the matter power spectrum since neutrinos do not contribute , for @xmath14 , to the gravitational potential wells produced by dark matter and baryons .",
    "hence the power spectrum is reduced by a factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the neutrino mass fraction .",
    "for the same reason , the growth rate of dark matter perturbations is suppressed and acquires a scale dependence @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass has non - trivial effects also on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies altering the redshift of matter - radiation equality , if @xmath17 is kept fixed .",
    "this translates into an overall modification of the amplitude and the location of the acoustic peaks .",
    "a change in the matter density would instead affect the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface @xmath18 , and the slope of the cmb spectrum at low multipoles , due to the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "many works attempted to measure neutrino mass combining different cosmological probes ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "one of the latest constraints come from recent planck results @xcite , that put an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses , @xmath19 . using instead large scale structure probes",
    ", @xcite find that @xmath20 , combining measurements from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) cmass dr11 with wmap9 .",
    "so they exclude massless neutrinos at @xmath21 , and including weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurements the significance is increased to @xmath22 .    among large scale structure probes , redshift - space distortions ( rsd )",
    "are one of the most promising ways to measure the neutrino mass .",
    "rsd are caused by galaxy peculiar velocities . when galaxy distances are computed from redshift measurements , assuming that the total velocity relative to the observer comes only from the hubble flow , one obtains a distorted density field .",
    "this distortion effect is clearly imprinted in the two - point correlation function of galaxies .",
    "in particular , the iso - correlation contours appear squashed along the line of sight ( los ) on linear scales , while non - linear motions produce an elongation effect known as fingers of god . the distortions on linear scales can be quantified by the distortion parameter @xmath23 which is the ratio of the growth rate of structures and their linear bias factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is strictly related to the matter density parameter , since @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the linear growth factor @xcite . therefore , rsd provide the possibility to recover some important information about the dynamics of galaxies and the amount of matter in the universe .",
    "massive neutrinos strongly affect the spatial clustering of cosmic structures : as shown , for instance , in @xcite , when assuming the same amplitude of primordial scalar perturbations , the average number density of large scale structures ( lss ) is suppressed in the massive neutrino scenario , and the halo bias is enhanced with respect to the massless case .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath27 decreases in the presence of massive neutrinos , due to their free - streaming which suppresses structure formation .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath28 , which describes the cumulative effect of non - linear motions , is reduced by an amount that increases with @xmath29 and @xmath30 . moreover , free - streaming massive neutrinos induce also a scale dependence in the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "finally , also the rms of the galaxy peculiar velocity is reduced with respect to the massless case , since both the growth rate @xmath31 and the matter power spectrum enter the bulk flow predicted by linear theory ( @xcite ) .    at intermediate scales ( @xmath32 \\lesssim 100 $ ] ) and low redshifts , these effects are degenerate with the amplitude of the matter power spectrum , parameterised by @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , the differences between the values of @xmath28 in a @xmath34 and a @xmath35 models are significantly reduced if the two cosmologies are normalised to the same value of @xmath33 .",
    "nonetheless , the relative difference between the theoretical values of @xmath28 in these two models , at @xmath36 , is @xmath37 , for @xmath38 , which corresponds to the precision reachable by future redshift surveys in measuring the redshift space distortion parameter at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "rsd can thus contribute to constrain the total neutrino mass , helping to disentangle the degeneracies with other cosmological parameters .",
    "the aim of this work is to exploit rsd to constrain cosmological parameters through a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) procedure and make forecasts on the statistical accuracy achievable with future cosmological probes .",
    "some attempts have been recently made to produce forecasts based on rsd using numerical simulations .",
    "for example , used mock surveys extracted from the millennium simulation to estimate the errors affecting measurements of the growth rate .",
    "they found a scaling relation for the relative error on the @xmath28 parameter as a function of the survey volume and mean density .",
    "this formula has been later refined by @xcite .",
    "the authors analysed the same catalogues of dark matter haloes used in the present work , extracted from a snapshot of the basicc simulation @xcite at @xmath40 , finding that the parameter @xmath28 can be underestimated by up to @xmath41 , depending on the minimum mass of the considered haloes .",
    "they also proposed a new fitting formula , that aims at separating the dependence of the statistical error on bias , density and volume : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    here",
    "we follow a similar approach to study how the error on cosmological parameters depends on the survey parameters , focusing in particular on the neutrino mass fraction .",
    "the main differences with respect to the work of @xcite are the following :    * we use a theoretical real - space correlation function obtained from the dark matter power spectrum instead of the deprojected one ; * we use the multipoles of the correlation function rather than the full two - dimensional correlation function ; * we use an mcmc likelihood analysis to estimate parameters .",
    "the combination of monopole and quadrupole is fundamental to break the degeneracy between the halo bias and @xmath0 , and thus to constrain the neutrino mass fraction , as we will discuss later in detail .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in  [ sec basicc ]",
    "we describe the basicc simulation and the method adopted to select the subsamples . in  [ sec method ]",
    "we describe the modellisation of the correlation function , the construction of the covariance matrix , and the approach used for the estimation of the best - fit parameters . in ",
    "[ sec res ] we present our results , showing the dependence of the errors on the simulation parameters , providing a fitting formula similar to eq .",
    "( [ bianchi_form ] ) .",
    "finally , in  [ sec concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "one of the building blocks of our work is the basicc simulation , the barionic acoustic oscillation simulation produced at the institute for computational cosmology @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of using numerical simulations is that we know a priori the value of the parameters we want to measure .",
    "moreover , simulations solve the problem of having only one universe available for observations .",
    "indeed it is possible to construct many mock catalogues , assuming the same cosmological parameters , and repeat the measurements for each of them . in particular , comparing the theoretical values of the parameters we want to measure with the mean of their measured estimates , we can assess the systematic errors due to the method , while the scatter between measurements gives us an estimate of the expected statistical errors .",
    "the basicc simulation has been explicitly designed to study bao features in the clustering pattern , so its volume is large enough to follow the growth of fluctuations on a wide range of scales . at the same time",
    ", its mass resolution is high enough to allow splitting the whole box in sub - cubes with the typical volumes of ongoing surveys , still preserving a good statistics on the scales which are central in the present analysis .",
    "the basicc simulation is made up by @xmath45 dark matter particles of mass @xmath46 , in a periodic box of side @xmath47 .",
    "the cosmological model adopted is a @xmath48 model with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the dark matter haloes are identified using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath53 times the mean particle separation .",
    "we consider only haloes with a minimum number of particles per halo of @xmath54 , so that the minimum halo mass is @xmath55 .",
    ".properties of the halo catalogues used in the analysis .",
    "@xmath56 is the minimum number of particles per halo ; @xmath57 is the corresponding threshold mass ; @xmath58 is the number of haloes with @xmath59 ; @xmath60 is the number density , computed as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the simulation volume ; @xmath63 is the bias value . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab errors ]    regardless these still open issues , the presented fitting formula can be used to forecast the precision reachable in measuring the neutrino mass fraction with forthcoming redshift surveys .",
    "recent constraints on neutrino mass came from different cosmological probes .",
    "for example , the latest planck results @xcite put an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses @xmath64 , and , in combination with lss surveys , the following constraints have been obtained : @xmath65 @xcite , @xmath66 @xcite and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "if we consider that a euclid - like survey should be able to cover a volume of @xmath68 , targeting a galaxy sample with bias @xmath69 and density @xmath70 , the neutrino mass fraction can be measured with a precision of @xmath71 .",
    "this value translates into an accuracy of @xmath72 , smaller than the one quoted into the euclid red book @xcite , obtained with the fisher matrix method from bao measurements .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that our predictions have been derived using very different probes and methodology , but most of all because we kept fixed many of the relevant cosmological parameters such as , for example , @xmath73 and the initial scalar amplitude of the power spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "predictions for other surveys are reported in table [ tab errors ] .",
    "overall , our analysis confirms that the two - point correlation function in redshift space provides a promising probe in the quest for neutrino mass .",
