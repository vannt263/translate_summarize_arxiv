    "a branching process is a very simple population model ( introduced in @xcite ) where particles breed and die ( independently of each other ) according to some random law . at any time , this process is completely characterized by the total number of particles alive .",
    "branching random walks ( in short , brws ) add space to this picture : particles live in a spatially structured environment and the reproduction law , which may depend on the location , not only tells how many children the particle has , but also where it places them .",
    "the state of the process , at any time , is thus described by the collection of the numbers of particles alive at @xmath1 , where @xmath1 varies among the possible sites . in the literature one can find brws both in continuous and discrete time .",
    "the continuous - time setting has been studied by many authors ( see @xcite just to name a few ) along with some variants of the process ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the discrete - time case has been initially considered as a natural generalization of branching processes ( see @xcite ) . the definition of discrete - time brw that we give in section  [ subsec : discrete ] is sufficiently general to include the discrete - time counterpart that every continuous - time brw admits .",
    "since every continuous - time brw and its discrete - time counterpart have the same asymptotic behavior , it suffices to provide results for the discrete - time case . on the other hand",
    ", continuous - time examples naturally yield discrete - time ones .",
    "our definition also includes as particular cases : brws with independent diffusion ( where particles are first generated and then dispersed independently according to a diffusion matrix @xmath2 , see section  [ subsec : discrete ] and equation  ) ; brws with no death ( where each particle has null probability of having no children ) ; brws whose total number of particles behaves as a branching process ( where the law of the number of offspring does not depend on the site , we call these brws locally isomorphic to a branching process , see section  [ subsec : fbrws ] ) .    the basic question which arises studying the brw is whether it survives with positive probability and , in this case , if it visits a given site infinitely many times .",
    "the first question asks whether there is global survival , that is , with positive probability at any time there is someone alive _ somewhere _ ) ; while the second question deals with local survival , that is , whether with positive probability the process returns infinitely many times to some fixed sites .",
    "it is clear that the probability of global survival is larger or equal to the probability of local survival .",
    "if the probability of global survival is strictly larger than the one of local survival , then the latter may be positive or null . in the first case",
    ", we say that there is non - strong local survival , in the second case there is pure global survival .",
    "when on the contrary , the probabilities of global and local survival are equal and strictly positive , we say that the brw has strong local survival . hence , strong local survival means that the events of local and global survival coincide ( but for a null probability set ) and have positive probability .",
    "the interest on the strong local behavior is fairly recent ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study some properties of the strong local survival , comparing them with the corresponding ones of local and global survival .    as in the case of branching processes , the main tool is that probabilities of extinction are fixed points of an infinite - dimensional generating function @xmath0 ( see sections  [ subsec : genfun ] for the definition and [ subsec : survivalprob ] for its link to the extinction probabilities ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , unlike the branching process case , it is not true that @xmath0 has at most two fixed points , even in the irreducible case ( where with positive probability a particle at site @xmath1 can have a progenies at site @xmath3 , for all @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) . indeed , we prove this indirectly by providing examples of irreducible brws which survive locally but with a smaller probability than the one of global survival ( hence non - strong locally , see examples  [ ex : nonstronglocalfbrw ] and [ ex : nonstronglocalfbrw2 ] ) and directly by an explicit construction of three fixed points for the @xmath0 of a certain brw ( remark  [ rem : spataru ] ) . by corollary",
    "[ cor : finitebrw ] we have that in the irreducible case a sufficient condition for the existence of at most two fixed points for @xmath0 is the finiteness of the set of vertices .    in the particular case where there is no branching",
    ", one gets a random walk and the role of @xmath0 and its fixed points is played by the transition matrix and the harmonic functions , respectively .",
    "it is thus natural to look for a maximum principle in the context of branching random walks as well ( see proposition  [ pro : maximumprinciple ] ) . as an application",
    ", we have that in the irreducible case , pure global survival is independent of the starting vertex .",
    "this is also true for local and global survival , but it does not hold for strong local survival , unless that the probability of having zero children is positive for all sites or if the brw is quasi transitive ( see sections  [ subsec : fbrws ] and [ subsec : survivalprob ] and corollary  [ pro : qtransitive ] ) .",
    "example  [ exm : irreduciblenotstrongeverywhere ] shows that we may have strong local survival starting from some vertices and non - strong local survival starting from others .",
    "the speed of reproduction of a continuous - time brw is proportional to a positive parameter @xmath4 ( see section  [ subsec : continuous ] ) .",
    "it is easily seen that the probability of local and global survival are nondecreasing functions with respect to @xmath4 ; thus local and global survival are monotone properties ( meaning that if one of them holds for some @xmath5 then it holds for all @xmath6 ) and it is possible to define the local and global critical parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see section  [ subsec : continuous ] ) .",
    "we show that monotonicity in @xmath4 does not hold for strong local survival and it is thus impossible in general to define a strong local critical parameter : for the irreducible brw in example  [ rem : nonstrongandstrong ] if @xmath4 is small enough or large enough there is strong local survival but in a intermediate interval for @xmath4 there is global and local survival with different probabilities .",
    "here is the outline of the paper . in section",
    "[ sec : basic ] we give the necessary definitions and some basic facts about discrete - time brws ( section  [ subsec : discrete ] ) , continuous - time brws ( section  [ subsec : continuous ] ) , the infinite - dimensional generating function @xmath0 , defined on @xmath9^x$ ] associated to a brw ( section  [ subsec : genfun ] ) and the special class of @xmath10-brws ( section  [ subsec : fbrws ] ) .",
    "this class contains properly the class of brws on quasi - transitive graphs ( which were studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we also exhibit the explicit expression of @xmath0 in a particular case of brw with independent diffusion ( equation  ) and of brw with no death constructed from a brw with death disregarding all particles with finite progenies ( equation  ) . moreover in section  [ subsec : genfun ] we state a maximum principle for the solutions of the equation @xmath11 , including all fixed points of @xmath0 ( proposition  [ pro : maximumprinciple ] )",
    ".    section  [ sec : survival ] is devoted to the study of all the types of survival .",
    "we first recall , in section  [ subsec : local ] , results on local and global survival ( theorems  [ th : discretesurv ] and [ th : continuoussurv ] ) . in section  [ subsec : survivalprob ]",
    "extinction probabilities are seen as fixed points of the generating function @xmath0 .",
    "theorem  [ rem : strongconditioned ] gives equivalent conditions for strong local survival , in terms of extinction probabilities , which are useful to prove that strong local survival is not monotone . from the maximum principle",
    "we derive theorem  [ th : fgraph ] , which describes some properties of fixed points of @xmath0 for @xmath10-brws , and corollaries  [ cor : finitebrw ] and [ pro : qtransitive ] .",
    "corollary  [ pro : qtransitive ] shows that for an irreducible , quasi - transitive brw , there are only three possible behaviours ( independently of the starting vertex ) : global extinction , pure global survival or strong local survival .",
    "thus , in this case strong local survival is monotone and the critical parameter is @xmath7 . a characterization of strong local survival in terms of the existence of a solution of some inequalities involving the generating function @xmath0 is given by theorem  [ th : menshikovvolkov ] .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] is devoted to examples and counterexamples . for a continuous - time irreducible @xmath10-brw ,",
    "the existence of a pure global phase is equivalent to nonamenability ( see section  [ subsec : discrete ] and section  [ subsec : stronglocal ] ) .",
    "nevertheless in general nonamenability neither implies nor is implied by the existence of a pure global phase ( example  [ exm : amenable ] ) .",
    "finally we show ( examples  [ ex : nonstronglocalfbrw ] and [ ex : nonstronglocalfbrw2 ] ) that even fairly simple brws ( such as irreducible brws with independent diffusion and with offspring distribution independent of the site ) may have non - strong local survival .",
    "this implies that , even in the irreducible case , the generating function @xmath0 may have more than two fixed points in @xmath9^x$ ] and disproves a result in @xcite ( see remark  [ rem : spataru ] ) .",
    "we start with the construction of a generic discrete - time brw @xmath12 ( see also @xcite where it is called _ infinite - type branching process _ ) on a set @xmath13 which is at most countable ; @xmath14 represents the number of particles alive at @xmath15 at time @xmath16 . to this aim",
