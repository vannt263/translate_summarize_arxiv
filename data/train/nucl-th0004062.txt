    "the zr isotopes undergo a clear and smooth shape transition with increasing neutron number .",
    "the isotopes which are displayed in figure [ fig : exp](a ) span from pure spherical nuclei that can be described in terms of simple shell - model configurations to the strongly deformed nucleus @xmath8zr .",
    "evidence for coexisting shapes has been reported around @xmath9zr @xcite . in the intermediate region , both @xmath6zr and @xmath7zr present evidence for sub - shell closure .",
    "these isotopes have a remarkably large gap between the ground state and the @xmath10 level , @xmath11 mev in @xmath6zr and @xmath12 mev in @xmath7zr .",
    "they also have a relatively low level density below 3 mev .",
    "empirically , the zr isotopes are fairly well established .",
    "lhersonneau and collaborators have recently performed careful experimental studies of the zr isotopes and neighbouring nuclei , and they have made major contributions to the identification of levels in @xmath13zr and @xmath14zr @xcite .    for comparison the empirical sr spectra are sketched in figure [ fig : exp](b ) .",
    "the sr isotopes differ from the zr isotopes by only two protons but are qualitatively quite different . compared to zr the sr isotopes have a much smoother behaviour with a stable @xmath15 spacing similar to that observed in tin .",
    "large gaps due to sub - shell closure as observed in @xmath6zr and @xmath7zr do not occur in sr .",
    "however , as in zr there is a clear transition from spherical to deformed shape around @xmath2 .",
    "the low - lying spectrum of @xmath9sr is a nearly perfect rotational band .",
    "it is a theoretical challenge to describe a sequence of isotopes with such big changes in the structure from one nucleus to another as in zr . for a proper description of the zr isotopes one",
    "has to allow for proton excitations .",
    "in particular , the protons seem to play a dominant role in the @xmath16 state .",
    "thus , the common choice of inert core has been @xmath5sr , though with large variations in the size of model space , truncation scheme and effective interactions , refs .",
    "the early calculation by auerbach and talmi @xcite was carried out with valence protons filling the ( @xmath17 ) oribitals and valence neutrons filling the ( @xmath18 ) orbital . in particular",
    "if one wants to describe more neutron rich zr isotopes a larger model space is required as the interaction between ( @xmath19 ) protons and ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) neutrons becomes increasingly important @xcite . to our knowledge the present work is the first shell - model calculation of the zr - isotopes which includes nuclei up to @xmath7zr within a non - truncated @xmath22 @xmath23 model space and with a fully realistic effective interaction .",
    "we will in the present work perform a systematic shell - model study of the zr isotopes from n=50 to n=58 , and will in particular pay attention to the nuclei around the closure of the neutron @xmath24 and @xmath25 sub - shells , @xmath26zr . in several works we have performed thorough analyses of the effective two - body interaction .",
    "we have derived shell - model effective interactions based on meson exchange models for the free nucleon - nucleon interaction , using many - body perturbation theory as described below .",
    "the systems that have been studied are reaching from the oxygen region to the tin isotopes and the n=82 isotones , refs .",
    "@xcite . for the lighter systems , such as the @xmath27- and @xmath28-shell nuclei",
    ", we obtained markedly better results for nuclei with one kind of valence nucleons than for nuclei with both kinds .",
    "for the heavier systems we have so far restricted ourselves to nuclei with like valence nucleons , such as the sn isotopes and the @xmath29 isotones . this way we have managed to keep the dimensionality of the eigenvalue problem within tractable limits .",
    "further , we have seen the need for establishing confidence in the @xmath30 interaction before considering systems with both valence protons and neutrons , where the proton - neutron interaction may play a crucial role .",
    "in fact , the zr isotopes represent a challenge on both these accounts .",
    "let us in terms of a simplified model like the weak coupling scheme , in which the proton - neutron interaction is assumed to be weak , see if one can gain insight into the qualitative properties of this interaction . in figure",
    "[ fig : wc ] we demonstrate the validity of this scheme by seeing how well it describes properties of @xmath31zr . in column one the empirical spectrum of @xmath32zr ( dashed lines ) , which represents the proton degrees of freedom ,",
    "is put on top of the @xmath32sr spectrum ( solid lines ) , which represents the neutron degrees of freedom .",
    "this would represent the @xmath33zr spectrum in the weak coupling limit and should be compared with the empirical @xmath33zr spectrum in column two .",
    "similarly the weak coupling spectra @xmath34zr and @xmath35zr are compared with the empirical @xmath36zr and @xmath6zr spectra , respectively .",
    "most states in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr are well reproduced by the weak coupling scheme .",
    "the model does however collapse in @xmath6zr , due to the presumed closure of the @xmath18 sub - shell which does not have a counterpart in @xmath36sr .",
    "the fact that the weak coupling scheme is fairly successful in describing @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr leads us to believe that the proton - neutron part of the effective interaction is either rather weak or state - independent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we give a summary of the calculation of the effective interaction and the shell model .",
    "then the results are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "3 and conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the aim of microscopic nuclear structure calculations is to derive various properties of finite nuclei from the underlying hamiltonian describing the interaction between nucleons .",
    "when dealing with nuclei , such as the zr isotopes with @xmath37 , the full dimensionality of the many - body schrdinger equation @xmath38 becomes intractable and one has to seek viable approximations to eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_a ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_a ] ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a state @xmath41 in the hilbert space .",
    "one is normally only interested in solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_a ] ) for certain low - lying states .",
    "it is then customary to divide the hilbert space into a model space defined by the operator @xmath42 and an excluded space defined by a projection operator @xmath43 @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the size of the model space and such that @xmath46 .",
    "the assumption is that the low - lying states can be fairly well reproduced by configurations consisting of a few particles occupying physically selected orbitals , defining the model space . in the present work ,",
    "the model space to be used both in the shell - model calculation and in the derivation of the effective interaction is given by the proton orbitals @xmath47 and @xmath19 and the neutron orbitals @xmath48 , @xmath18 , @xmath49 , @xmath21 and @xmath50 .",
    "( [ eq : full_a ] ) can then be rewritten as a secular equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 now is an effective hamiltonian acting solely within the chosen model space .",
    "the term @xmath53 is the unperturbed hamiltonian while the effective interaction is given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , ...  being effective one - body , two - body , three - body interactions etc .",
    "it is also customary in nuclear shell - model calculations to add the one - body effective interaction @xmath55 to the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian so that @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "this allows us to replace the eigenvalues of @xmath60 by the empirical single - particle energies for the nucleon orbitals of our model space , or valence space .",
    "thus , the remaining quantity to calculate is the two- or more - body effective interaction @xmath61 . in this work",
    "we will restrict our attention to the derivation of an effective two - body interaction @xmath62 using the many - body methods discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and briefly reviewed below .",
    "our procedure for obtaining an effective interaction for the zr isotopes starts with a free nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath63 which is appropriate for nuclear physics at low and intermediate energies . at present",
    ", there are several potentials available .",
    "the most recent versions of machleidt and co - workers @xcite , the nimjegen group @xcite and the argonne group @xcite have all a @xmath64 per datum close to @xmath65 . in this work we will thus choose to work with the charge - dependent version of the bonn potential models , see ref .",
    "the potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite is an extension of the one - boson - exchange models of the bonn group @xcite , where mesons like @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and the fictitious @xmath71 meson are included . in the charge - dependent version of ref .",
    "@xcite , the first five mesons have the same set of parameters for all partial waves , whereas the parameters of the @xmath71 meson are allowed to vary .",
    "the next step in our perturbative many - body scheme is to handle the fact that the strong repulsive core of the nucleon - nucleon potential @xmath72 is unsuitable for perturbative approaches .",
    "this problem is overcome by introducing the reaction matrix @xmath73 given by the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation @xmath74 where @xmath70 is the unperturbed energy of the interacting nucleons , and @xmath53 is the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the operator @xmath75 , commonly referred to as the pauli operator , is a projection operator which prevents the interacting nucleons from scattering into states occupied by other nucleons . in this work",
    "we solve the bethe - goldstone equation for five starting energies @xmath70 , by way of the so - called double - partitioning scheme discussed in e.g. , ref .",
    "the @xmath73-matrix is the sum over all ladder type of diagrams .",
    "this sum is meant to renormalize the repulsive short - range part of the interaction .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the particles must interact with each other an infinite number of times in order to produce a finite interaction .",
    "finally , we briefly sketch how to calculate an effective two - body interaction for the chosen model space in terms of the @xmath73-matrix . since the @xmath73-matrix represents just the summmation to all orders of ladder diagrams with particle - particle intermediate states , there are obviously other terms which need to be included in an effective interaction .",
    "long - range effects represented by core - polarization terms are also needed .",
    "the first step then is to define the so - called @xmath76-box given by @xmath77 the @xmath76-box is made up of non - folded diagrams which are irreducible and valence linked .",
    "a diagram is said to be irreducible if between each pair of vertices there is at least one hole state or a particle state outside the model space . in a valence - linked diagram",
    "the interactions are linked ( via fermion lines ) to at least one valence line .",
    "note that a valence - linked diagram can be either connected ( consisting of a single piece ) or disconnected . in the final expansion including folded diagrams",
    "as well , the disconnected diagrams are found to cancel out @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the cancellation of unlinked diagrams of the goldstone expansion @xcite .",
    "these definitions are discussed in refs .",
    "we can then obtain an effective interaction @xmath78 in terms of the @xmath76-box @xcite , with @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 refer to the effective interaction after @xmath82 and @xmath83 iterations .",
    "the zeroth iteration is represented by just the @xmath76-box .",
    "observe also that the effective interaction @xmath84 is evaluated at a given model space energy @xmath70 , as is the case for the @xmath73-matrix as well .",
    "here we choose @xmath85 mev .",
    "moreover , although @xmath76 and its derivatives contain disconnected diagrams , such diagrams cancel exactly in each order @xcite , thus yielding a fully connected expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fd ] ) .",
    "less than @xmath86 iterations were needed in order to obtain a numerically stable result .",
    "all non - folded diagrams through third order in the interaction @xmath73 are included . for further details ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective two - particle interaction can in turn be used in shell - model calculations .",
    "our approach in solving the eigenvalue problem is the lanczos algorithm , which is an iterative method that gives the solutions of the lowest eigenstates .",
    "the technique is described in detail in refs . @xcite .",
    "the shell - model code developed by us is designed for an @xmath87-scheme slater determinant ( sd ) representation .",
    "even with a rather restricted single - particle basis the size of the shell - model problem grows rapidly with increasing number of active valence particles .",
    "table [ tab : dimension ] shows how the number of configurations in an sd - basis grows with the number of valence particles acting within the ( @xmath3 ) proton shell and the ( @xmath4 ) neutron shell relative to the @xmath5sr - core . note that the @xmath7zr system consists of more than 26.000.000 basis states . only a few years ago shell - model calculations on such systems were not tractable .",
    "even with today s fast computers and effective algorithms this kind of calculation is still rather time consuming .",
    "the single - neutron energies are taken to be those deduced from @xmath88sr in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the literature",
    "the single - proton energy splitting @xmath89 varies from 0.839 mev to 1.0 mev @xcite .",
    "as the final results show little sensitivity to variations within this energy interval we let the @xmath19 single - proton energy relative to @xmath47 be 0.9 mev .",
    "the single - particle energies used in this work are listed in table [ tab : sp ] .",
    "in this section we present the calculations of the zr isotopes .",
    "firstly , we analyze some systematics of the even zr isotopes .",
    "the results are displayed in figures [ fig:92 - 94zr ] and [ fig:96 - 98zr ] ( for some selected states ) and in more detail in tables [ tab:90 - 92zr ] , [ tab:94 - 96zr ] and [ tab:98zr ] .",
    "then , we proceed with the discussion of the odd zr isotopes , in figure [ fig:97zr ] and tables [ tab:91 - 93zr ] and [ tab:95 - 97zr ] .",
    "a major aim is to investigate the effective interaction that has been derived for this mass region .",
    "since the odd nuclei are generally more sensitive to the underlying assumptions made , this may give an even more severe test of the interaction and the foundations on which our model is based . at the end of this section",
    "we discuss problems concerning the binding energies . in order to study the effect of the proton degrees of freedom we have also performed a more restricted calculation , considering only valence neutrons with respect to a @xmath32zr - core .",
    "the experimental spectra of the two nuclei , @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr , show very similar features .",
    "the shell - model calculation does also provide @xmath90 , @xmath10 and @xmath91 levels in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr with quite similar features , although the three levels are too compressed compared to their experimental counterparts .",
    "comparison of the results obtained with @xmath32zr- and @xmath5sr - cores indicates that these levels are little affected by proton excitations . in @xmath6zr the calculated @xmath90 , @xmath10 and @xmath91 levels are still too compressed , though not as pronounced as in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr , while in @xmath7zr the calculated spectrum is more open than the experimental one .",
    "the energy of the empirical @xmath92 level , figure [ fig : exp](a ) , is monotonously reduced with increasing neutron number . in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr the calculated @xmath92 level is obtained at about 2 mev , while in @xmath6zr and @xmath7zr the @xmath92 level is obtained much too high at about 3.5 mev . due to the extension of the model space from a @xmath32zr - core to a @xmath5sr - core the @xmath92 level in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr undergoes a considerable lowering , yielding results close to the experimental values . from the occupation numbers in table [ tab : occupation ]",
    "it is clear that the @xmath92 state undergoes a structural change from @xmath36zr to @xmath6zr .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath48 orbitals start to play a more important role . for comparison ,",
    "the observed @xmath92 levels in sr , figure [ fig : exp](b ) , are all situated around 2 mev .",
    "their calculated counterparts are located too high , at about 3 mev excitation energy .",
    "the structure of the @xmath92 level in zr is totally different from the structure in sr , figure [ fig : sr ] .",
    "let us look in detail into these states by comparing the @xmath92 levels in @xmath33sr and @xmath36zr .",
    "both nuclei have four valence neutrons . in @xmath33sr",
    "the dominant configuration is @xmath93_{j=3^{-}}$ ] whereas in @xmath36zr the dominant configuration is @xmath94_{j=3^{-}}$ ] .",
    "the difference can be ascribed to the single - particle energies . in zr",
    "the @xmath92 state is created by exciting a proton into the @xmath19 orbital instead of exciting a neutron into the @xmath50 orbital . because the @xmath50 orbital is located very high in the single - particle spectrum",
    "it is more favourable to excite a proton rather than a neutron .",
    "the situation for the @xmath95 level is more stable throughout the whole sequence of zr isotopes , with empirical values between 2.5 and 3.0 mev .",
    "the @xmath32zr - core calculations provide level energies that are 1.0 - 1.5 mev too high , while the @xmath5sr - core calculations give energies too low by about 1 mev .",
    "this state consists predominantly of configurations with a proton excited into the @xmath19 orbital and the neutrons remaining in the lowest possible single - particle orbitals .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , there are strong variations in the structure from one nucleus to another , reflected in for instance the @xmath15 spacing .",
    "qualitatively we reproduce the variation in the @xmath15 spacing quite well , as shown in figure [ fig:2-pluss ] , although in @xmath96zr the gap is @xmath97 kev less than the experimental spacing .    in spite of clear differences in the experimental zr and sr spectra , the shell - model calculation provides rather similar results",
    ". the calculated zr spectra are in far better agreement with experimental data than the calculated sr spectra , which may indicate that the core is in a different condition in the two systems . in sr",
    "the core seems to be relatively soft , whereas in zr the two additional protons tend to stabilize the core .",
    "the proton degrees of freedom are crucial in order to describe certain energy levels . for example",
    ", the first excited @xmath16 state in @xmath33zr has strong components of proton excitations . from the occupation numbers in table [ tab : occupation0 ] we see that the character of @xmath90 state is totally different from the @xmath16 state .",
    "the proton parts of their wave functions are almost orthogonal to each others . in the ground state",
    "the protons are most likely to be found in the @xmath47-orbital , while for the excited @xmath98-state it is more probable to find the protons in the @xmath19-orbital . however , in @xmath6zr the two shell - model @xmath98 states have nearly the same proton structure , almost pure @xmath99 configuration .",
    "the @xmath98 levels in @xmath7zr show similar structure as in @xmath6zr , but the @xmath16 state has slightly stronger @xmath19 mixing than in @xmath6zr .",
    "the third @xmath98 state in both @xmath6zr and @xmath7zr have @xmath100 as the predominant proton configuration .",
    "the change in the proton configuration with increasing neutron number was observed in pick - up experiments by saha _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "clear signs of sub - shell closure are seen in @xmath6zr and also in @xmath7zr , due to filling of the @xmath18 and the @xmath48 orbitals , respectively . from @xmath36zr",
    "to @xmath6zr the gap between the ground state and the @xmath10 state is doubled .",
    "the experimental @xmath101 gap increases , from 0.919 mev in @xmath36zr to 1.751 mev in @xmath6zr , and the calculated gap is also more than doubled , from 0.520 mev to 1.426 mev . in @xmath7zr",
    "the calculated spacing is larger than the experimental one .",
    "the experimental @xmath15 spacing is 1.223 mev , and the corresponding calculated spacing 1.463 mev .",
    "the @xmath6zr ground state @xmath18 occupation number is 5.66 , and in @xmath7zr the @xmath18 and @xmath48 occupation numbers are 5.76 and 1.87 , respectively .",
    "the total impression of the @xmath7zr shell - model results displayed in figure [ fig:96 - 98zr ] is disappointing . only the @xmath10 level is reasonably reproduced . as an alternative to the extremely time and",
    "space consuming calculation presented in figure [ fig:96 - 98zr ] , we may close the @xmath18 orbital and perform a @xmath36sr - core shell - model calculation of the system . the results , shown in table [ tab:98zr ] , are much improved .",
    "experimental and calculated e2 transition rates are tabulated in table [ tab : e2 ] . in order to bring the theoretical results into agreement with the measured @xmath102 transition rates we have employed effective charges of 1.8@xmath103 and 1.5@xmath103 for the protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the effective charges obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , however a bit overestimated compared to the fitting to data on @xmath33mo and @xmath104zr done by halse in ref .",
    "to be mentioned , the calculation of effective charges based on perturbative many - body methods @xcite gives much smaller values , @xmath105 and in the range @xmath106 for the proton and neutron effective charge , respectively .",
    "we adopt halse s effective value of the oscillator parameter @xmath107 fm .",
    "the value was choosen by reference to measurements for the radii of the single - particle orbitals in @xmath88sr and of the charge distributions in @xmath108mo , refs . @xcite and @xcite .    with effective charges and the oscillator parameter",
    "as described above , the transition rates between yrast states are fairly well reproduced . in the former discussion",
    "we have focused on the @xmath16 state , in particlular its proton structure . in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr",
    "we totally fail in reproducing the transition rates involving the @xmath16 state .",
    "the experimental transition rates between @xmath16 and @xmath10 in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr are relatively strong , 14.3(5 ) and 9.3(4 ) w.u .",
    ", respectively , whereas the calculated transition rates are two to three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "similarly , in @xmath7zr there is an experimental transition rate between @xmath109 and @xmath10 with strength 51(5 ) w.u .",
    "the corresponding calculated transition rate is negligible .",
    "in fact , the occupation numbers in table [ tab : occupation0 ] show that the @xmath109 state in @xmath7zr has similar proton structure to the @xmath16 state in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr .",
    "leaving out the neutron contributions , as done in column 6 of table [ tab : e2 ] , by setting the effective neutron charge equal to zero , we observe that the proton part of the wave function contributes more to the transitions involving the excited @xmath98 states than what it does to the other transition rates .",
    "the contribution is however far from sufficient and there is a cancellation effect between the proton and neutron contributions .",
    "contributions to the transition rates between yrast states do on the other hand mainly stem from the neutron degrees of freedom . in conclusion",
    ", it seems that the @xmath16 states in @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr and the @xmath109 state in @xmath7zr contain strong collective components not reproduced by the present shell model calculation .",
    "it is somehow surprising to notice that the shell model gives a much better description of the odd than of the even zr isotopes .",
    "the reproduction of the low - lying positive parity states are overall satisfactory .",
    "on the other hand the shell model has some problems in describing the negative parity states .",
    "several of the negative parity states in @xmath110zr are calculated up to 1 mev too low .",
    "only a few negative parity states are known in @xmath111zr .",
    "thus a detailed comparison is difficult , but the @xmath112 state is reproduced in nice agreement with experiment .",
    "we will make a detailed study of @xmath113zr .",
    "this nucleus is not too simple and not too complex ( two protons and three neutrons outside the closed core ) , and useful information can therefore be extracted from a few central and relatively simple configurations .",
    "the shell - model calculation provides three states below 600 kev , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . from experiments ,",
    "only two states are known , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "there are however theoretical arguments supporting a low - lying @xmath116-state .",
    "the configuration that requires the least energy has all particles in the lowest possible single - particle orbital . in the case of @xmath113zr the two protons occupy the @xmath47 single - particle orbital , and couple to @xmath117 .",
    "the three neutrons occupy the @xmath18-orbital @xmath118 .",
    "the three neutrons can then couple to @xmath119 , @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "such states will be located well below 1 mev .",
    "the lowest experimental @xmath121 candidate observed up to now is seen at 1.46 mev .",
    "as many as four @xmath122 states are observed within a small energy interval of 250 kev in the region from 0.95 mev to 1.22 mev .",
    "this observation has no shell - model counterpart .",
    "our calculation provides only one @xmath122 level at 1.40 mev .",
    "we already pointed out that our model has difficulty in describing the negative parity states .",
    "consider for example the structure of the @xmath112 state in @xmath113zr , which comes 500 kev lower than the experimental position .",
    "odd parity states are constructed by configurations with an odd number of particles in negative parity states . within our model , protons can occupy the @xmath47-orbital and neutrons can occupy the @xmath50-orbital to produce negative parity states .",
    "both the first and second excited @xmath123 states in @xmath113zr are predominantly based on the proton configuration @xmath124 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath112 state in the other zr isotopes .",
    "finally , we examine @xmath13zr .",
    "as we would expect for a system caught in between two `` magic '' nuclei we recognize pronounced single - particle structure . from the occupation numbers , listed in table [ tab : occ ] ,",
    "we see that both the ground state , @xmath125 , and the next level , @xmath126 , are pure one - quasiparticle states built on a full @xmath18-orbital , i.e. @xmath6zr - core .",
    "also the @xmath127 state is a one - quasiparticle state with the @xmath18-orbital nearly closed , though its calculated position is about 0.7 mev too high .",
    "this means that a somewhat lower single - particle energy @xmath128might be more appropriate for our effective interaction .",
    "the @xmath129 state can be regarded as a @xmath18-hole state relative to the @xmath7zr - core .",
    "all in all the yrast states apart from @xmath130 are very well reproduced . in the other , non - yrast states , the @xmath6zr - core breaks up and",
    "two neutrons are distributed equally among the @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals .",
    "the binding energies calculated by the formula @xmath131 are plotted in figure [ fig : be ] . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : be ] ) @xmath82 is the number of valence neutrons .",
    "the experimental binding energies show a parabola structure with a minimum at @xmath6zr , whereas the calculated binding energies increase linearly down to @xmath7zr . with increasing neutron number the systems become far too strongly bound .",
    "this phenomenon of overbinding of nuclear systems when effective interactions from meson theory are used has been much discussed in the literature , for example in ref .",
    "the solutions to the problem has been that such matrix elements must be modified in order to reproduce the binding energies correctly .",
    "the so - called centroid matrix elements should be corrected in order to reproduce experiment .",
    "however , there is no well - defined recipe for doing this .",
    "the curve labeled `` no pn - int '' in figure [ fig : be ] shows the binding energies with the proton - neutron interaction switched off .",
    "now , the systems are too weakly bound , which tells us that the proton - neutron part of the interaction contributes strongly to the overbinding .",
    "we have made the pn - interaction less attractive by adding an overall constant to the diagonal matrix elements .",
    "this will not affect the excitation energies relative to the ground state .",
    "the constant is chosen such as to fit the experimental binding energy of @xmath32y .",
    "thus , a constant 0.3 mev added to the original diagonal proton - neutron matrix elements , @xmath132 , gives binding energies as shown in figure [ fig : be ] , labeled `` modified pn - int . '' .",
    "the fit to the experimental values are much improved , although there is a linear rather than parabolic dependence on the particle number .",
    "in this work we have performed a full @xmath133 proton and @xmath134 neutron shell - model calculation of the zirconium isotopes ranging from n=52 to n=60 . for the first time we present results from calculations with a proton - neutron effective interaction in such heavy nuclei .",
    "we have succeeded in obtaining a qualitative reproduction of important properties , although there are also shortcomings .",
    "the odd isotopes are very well described by our shell model , in fact better than the calculated even isotopes . both for the odd and the even nuclei we have difficulties in reproducing the negative parity states well .    for comparison",
    "we have presented shell - model results for the neighbouring strontium isotopes .",
    "the qualitative features are much better reproduced in zr than in sr .",
    "for example , the shell model fails in reproducing the very stable @xmath135 spacing in sr . differently from zr",
    ", there is no sign of n=56 and n=58 sub - shell closures in sr .",
    "the quality of the closed - shell core ( @xmath5sr ) may in fact be different for the two sets of isotopes .",
    "it is likely that the additional protons in zr give a more balanced system and serve to stabilize the core . in sr",
    "the core seems to be softer and more unstable .",
    "the empirical zr spectra can to a certain extent be interpreted in a weak coupling scheme .",
    "the isotopes @xmath33zr and @xmath36zr are well described in terms of this model , which in turn indicates that the proton - neutron interaction should not be too strong .",
    "the simple weak coupling picture collapses however in @xmath6zr .    in order to obtain results for @xmath7zr , we performed calculations that are extremely heavy and time consuming .",
    "all the efforts gave final results that were far off , and in fact a much simpler calculation based on a @xmath36sr - core provided results in better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the occupation numbers give a hint that the @xmath21 and the @xmath50 neutron orbitals are of minor importance .",
    "the major properties are in fact fairly well described within a reduced basis @xmath136 @xmath137 .    in order to further test the wave functions we calculated e2 transition rates in the even zr isotopes .",
    "transitions between yrast states are fairly well reproduced , whereas transitions involving certain excited @xmath98 states are calculated far too small , indicating that these states contain strong components not accounted for by the present shell model .    as in other mass regions we fail in reproducing bulk properties such as the binding energies . with increasing number of valence nucleons the systems",
    "become far too strongly bound .",
    "we have demonstrated that this problem can be cured by simple adjustments of some selected matrix elements .",
    "the calculations have been carried out at the ibm cluster at the university of oslo .",
    "support for this from the research council of norway ( nfr ) is acknowledged .",
    "the low - lying experimental and calculated energy - levels in @xmath138zr are listed in tables [ tab:90 - 92zr ] , [ tab:94 - 96zr ] and [ tab:98zr ] .",
