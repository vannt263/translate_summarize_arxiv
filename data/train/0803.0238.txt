    "black - hole binaries are primarily observed to be in two main spectral states ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review on the spectral states and the related variability ) . in the hard / low state",
    ", the spectrum can be approximately described as a hard power - law , with the typical photon index of @xmath2 , and a high energy cutoff above @xmath3 kev @xcite , and only a weak soft x - ray component .",
    "the likely physical origin of that spectrum is thermal comptonization of some soft photons by a hot plasma with @xmath4 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hot plasma may be identified as an inner hot accretion disc surrounded by a truncated outer cold disc , which provides seed photons for comptonization @xcite . on the other hand , in the soft / high state ,",
    "the spectrum consists of a soft blackbody - like component , which dominates the luminosity , and a hard x - ray power - law tail with a photon index @xmath53 with no detectable high energy cutoff .",
    "while the soft component is consistent with the emission of a cool accretion disc extending close to the innermost stable orbit , the nature of the hard power - law tail is less clear .",
    "detailed modeling of spectra and long - term variability shows that it is well represented by comptonization of soft photons by a hybrid plasma , i.e. , containing both thermal and non - thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "this plasma may exist in the form of active , time - varying , regions above the cold disc @xcite .",
    "in addition , during transitions between those two states , black - hole binaries also show the state called intermediate or very high . in each state , there are significant spectral and flux variations on a variety of time - scales .",
    "the temporal variability of a black hole system is different in the hard and soft spectral states . during the hard state , the power spectrum ,",
    "@xmath6 , is approximately a broken power law with the breaks at the frequencies of @xmath7 hz and @xmath8 hz @xcite , whereas the power spectrum in the soft state is approximately a power law with a high frequency cutoff above @xmath9 hz @xcite .",
    "in addition , discrete features , referred to as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , are often observed .",
    "attempts have been made to identify the centroid frequencies of these qpos with frequencies at specific radii of the disc , which could either be the truncation radius @xcite or the radius of a resonance between the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies @xcite .",
    "these intriguing interpretations do not generally address the origin of the continuum variability .",
    "detailed but empirical fitting of the power spectra using lorentzian functions reveal that the continuum variability is complex in nature .",
    "often three or more components ( with a total of nine or more parameters ) are required to adequately describe the spectra @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that this apparent complexity appears because the lorentzian function may not be an adequate description of the variability . in the framework of the active flare model",
    ", the continuum variability can be explained by the rise and fall time scales of the flares and the frequency at which they occur @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation does not make a direct connection with the characteristic dynamic frequencies of the accretion disc .",
    "the accretion process in a disc occurs via angular momentum loss through turbulence , which nature and origin remain uncertain . in the standard accretion disc model @xcite , this uncertainty is parametrized by approximating the turbulent behavior as an effective viscosity providing a stress proportional to the local pressure .",
    "while such a prescription may indeed provide a reasonable approximation to the time - averaged disc , the effect of turbulence on time - dependent properties of the disc is much more uncertain .",
    "@xcite showed that if the viscosity parameter varies at each disc radius with a local characteristic frequency , the accretion rate in the inner disc fluctuates with the flicker - noise behaviour , i.e. , with @xmath10 .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the observed power - law of the soft - state of black hole systems . also , it explains the x - ray variability observed mostly at low frequencies in spite of the characteristic frequencies of the inner disc , where the x - rays originate , being much higher .",
    "such a generic model where variability propagates from larger radii to smaller ones can also explain the observed frequency - dependent photon - energy lags in cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the observed linear rms - flux relationship @xcite .    in these models ,",
    "a high frequency break in the power spectrum is likely to correspond to a characteristic frequency at the innermost radius .",
    "since the break observed in the soft state is typically at @xmath11 hz , @xcite suggested that this corresponds to the viscous time scale of the inner disc .",
    "@xcite have generalized this model by invoking a power - law variation of the viscosity parameter with radius , and used a specific form for the local perturbations .",
    "they show that the observed power spectra of black hole systems can be explained by a model with two components , corresponding to the outer disc and an inner hot region .",
    "a crucial element of such models , as noted by @xcite , is that the time scale for the variations should be as long as the viscous one in order to explain the observed high frequency break . on the other hand ,",
    "the main characteristic time scale is the epicyclic one , which is significantly shorter .",
    "@xcite note that even the characteristic magnetic dynamo time scale is also expected to be significantly smaller than the viscous one .",
    "if the dissipation is driven by turbulence induced by magnetic instabilities , it is that dynamo time scale which should dominate the observed variability . @xcite and @xcite provide a solution to this problem by suggesting that large scale outflows can only occur when weak random events in different disc annuli by chance give rise to a coherent poloidal field .",
    "the time scale for that is much longer than the local dynamo one .",
    "it is then these large scale outflows that govern the observed slow variability .",
    "those authors have developed a specific disc model incorporating the stochastic dynamo action as well as jet / wind outflows .",
    "their numerical results suggest that it may also explain observed variability of black hole systems .    in all these models ,",
    "the variability is associated with the unknown turbulence and not with the characteristic dynamic time scales of the disc .",
    "on the other hand , the _ simplest _ variability model would associate it with epicyclic oscillation at each radius , with the net variability due to a superposition of these oscillations . in this approach , even if variability at large radii induces some low frequency fluctuations in the inner regions @xcite , the dominant local power should correspond to the epicyclic time scales .",
    "however , such a natural model in its simple version would predict a much higher break frequency than that observed .    in this work ,",
    "we propose that these natural oscillations do indeed occur , but a damping , viscous - like , effect , suppresses the high frequencies .",
    "a likely reason for the viscous damping is the same turbulence that causes the viscous dissipation .",
    "thus , contrary to the models mentioned above where the observed variability is primarily due to variations in the turbulent viscosity and/or dynamo effects , the variability in our model is due to the natural dynamic oscillations of a disc but damped by viscous - like effects ( perhaps also the turbulence ) .",
    "based on this idea , we have developed a simple framework that explains the power spectra of black - hole binaries in the soft state .",
    "we limit the analysis to this state , where , as mentioned earlier , an optically - thick disc extends nearly to the last stable orbit .",
    "although most of the observed variability in the soft state occurs in the high energy photons , and hence it should be associated with active regions or flares , it is expected that the underlying disc is still the main driver of the variability ( e.g. , via magnetic buoyancy ) .",
    "we assume that the disc variability at each radius is governed by a damped harmonic oscillator at the corresponding epicyclic frequency .",
    "this dynamic variation induces both linear and non - linear responses in the emitted radiation .",
    "the total observed variability of a source is then a sum of these contributions , weighted by the relative contribution of the radiation from a given radius .",
    "we find that the predicted power spectrum is completely determined by only three effective parameters including normalization , and it can explain the different spectral shapes observed for cyg x-1 in the soft state . whereas a degeneracy between the black hole mass and the damping factor does not allow the determination of the mass of the system , the model constrains it to @xmath0@xmath1 , which is consistent with other mass measurements .    in section [ model ]",
    ", we describe the model . in section",
    "[ fits ] , we compare the predicted power spectra with observations from _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) . in section [ rms - flux ] , we discuss implications of our results for the relationship between the rms and the flux . in section [ discussion ] , we briefly discuss and summarize the results .",
    "the variability of a dynamic quantity , @xmath12 , at each radii of the accretion disc is assumed to be governed by a damped harmonic equation , @xmath13 where @xmath14/x_0 $ ] is the normalized fractional variation , with @xmath15 being an average of @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath16 is a stochastic driving term and @xmath17 is the epicyclic frequency , which for the schwarzschild metric equals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the mass of the black hole .",

    "thus , the observed linear component of the power spectrum corresponding to an annular radius , @xmath27 , is @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fourier transforms of @xmath32 , @xmath24 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that in the frequency range of interest , the driving fluctuations , @xmath16 , are dominated by a @xmath33 noise such that @xmath34 valid for @xmath35 greater than a low frequency cutoff , @xmath36 .",

    "the radial extent of these active regions is not clear , and , in particular , the energy dissipated in them as a function of radius remains unknown .",
    "thus , it is difficult to obtain the form of the weight function , @xmath48 , from first principles .",

    "this corresponds to the maximum epicyclic frequency , @xmath61 , equation ( [ epicyclic ] ) , which is achieved at @xmath62 , very close to the maximum of the gravitational energy dissipation rate , @xmath48 , equation ( [ g_r ] ) . in the time domain , we can define the corresponding time scale as @xmath63 ms .",
    "observationally , it roughly corresponds to the shortest e - folding time scales seen yet ( which happened in the soft state ) from cyg x-1 @xcite .    for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , which is a consequence of the form of driving variability of @xmath66 .",
    "as @xmath50 increases , the system becomes more damped , and the spectrum shows a cutoff at a frequency @xmath67 . for large values of @xmath68 ,",
