    "a wealth of results on qcd in @xmath1 annihilation emerged from the lep experiments .",
    "the main emphasis of these studies was on high - statistics 3-jet configurations . however , in the second part of lep running and with the advent of nlo calculations for @xmath2jets , a new class of studied appeared yielding high precision results using multijet events .",
    "the most basic observable characterising multijet configurations are jet rates . as an example the 5-jet rate measured at lep1 by aleph @xcite",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aleph5j ] .",
    "the presented data are corrected for acceptance and detector resolution effects to the hadron level .",
    "hadronisation corrections , relevant for comparisons with nlo calculations , are not applied at this stage but shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aleph5j ] to indicate their size .",
    "the experimental systematic uncertainties are between one and two @xmath3 in the central part and increasing toward the phase space edges .",
    "the measurements are compared to various leading - log generators , which generate higher jet multiplicity only in the cascade of parton showers . again in the peak region a reasonable agreement is observed .",
    "jet rates exhibit a clear dependence on the value of @xmath0 , since at leading order @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution of jet rates at a fixed value of @xmath5 with centre - of - mass energy hence reveals the running of @xmath0 , as demonstrated by a measurement of l3 @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l3j ] .    , width=377 ]",
    "naturally the class of observables receiving most of attention beyond 3-jets are the 4-jet observables .",
    "4-jet production receives contributions from double - bremsstrahlung and gluon splitting diagrams , the latter into gluonic and quarkonic final states , each of them contributing with a different color factor ( ratio ) .",
    "this color structure can be measured by combining different angular observables constructed in the 4-jet system in order to extract the color factor ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 with nominal qcd su(3 ) values @xmath8=3 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . on top of this residual dependence on the color factors the perturbative predictions for differential distributions receive an overall normalisation factor in powers of @xmath0 , yielding at nlo a prediction of the following form : @xmath11 + { \\cal o}(\\eta^4)\\ ; ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\eta(\\mu)=\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)\\cdot c_f}{2\\pi}\\ ; , \\ ] ] for a generic 4-jet observable @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the analyses determine usually the color factors and @xmath0 simultaneously , using fits to both angular variables with a particular sensitivity to the color factor ratios and event - shape- / jetrate - type observables with better sensitivity to @xmath0 .",
    "the distributions of representative observables of each class are shown for the angular correlations in fig .",
    "[ fig : a34 ] and for the 4-jet rate in fig .",
    "[ fig : ar4 ] .",
    "0.48 0.9 0.9        0.91        simultaneous analyses have been carried out recently by aleph @xcite and opal @xcite yielding results summarised in table  [ tab : colfac ] .",

    "the value of @xmath0 is lower and the one of @xmath13 much higher .",
    "this can also bee seen in the confidence level contour plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : l3asa0 ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainties for the measurement using the d - parameter are also significantly larger .",
    "this seems to indicate that , although a reasonable qualitative description is obtained , additional terms are needed to achieve a good quantitative description .     vs. @xmath0 for power correction analyses to event - shape",

    "multijet observables , mostly based on 4-jet configurations , have given access to precision measurements of @xmath0 and the qcd color factors .",
    "a wealth of experimental data on 4-jet event - shape variables is available from lep and awaiting higher order qcd calculations to be analysed .",
    "currently , only the d - parameter has been analysed for power corrections yielding mildly discrepant results .",
    "this is to be confirmed by further analyses of other 4-jet event shapes . beyond 4-jets ,",
    "jet rates have been measured for up to 6 jets and for certain multijet - configurations dedicated observables like the jet - resolution parameter @xmath14 are available for 5- and 6-jets .",
    "the potential of these high jet multiplicity events is still to be explored .",
