    "let us derive the corresponding relation from this condition . as cs contribution is negligible at very high @xmath1 regime @xcite",

    "when @xmath1 is large , at least one of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 needs to be large . as we are considering a dilute - dense collision , the contribution from the region where @xmath75 is large should be less important , which implies we can take the collinear limit for the proton side and give @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the gluon collinear pdf and @xmath80 are collinear limit of @xmath81 which have been calculated in @xcite . because @xmath82 decreases as inverse powers of @xmath83 , the dominant contribution for eq",
    ".   comes from two regions , either @xmath76 is small or @xmath84 is small .",
    "it is clear that @xmath80 must be a symmetric function under the transformation @xmath85 , thus , in either case , we can set @xmath76 to be zero in @xmath80 and it becomes independent of @xmath76 .",
    "then we can perform the @xmath76 integration in eq .",
    ", which gives @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 defined in eq",
    ".   behaves as @xmath87 note that , although we have used the collinear approximation to derive the above relation , the relation holds much better than the collinear approximation itself , which is caused by the cancellation between the contributions to the numerator and denominator of @xmath2 from large @xmath75 region .",
    "it is known that mv model with rcbk equation gives @xmath88 at high @xmath89 limit @xcite , we therefore have @xmath90 , where at the last step we assume that the @xmath91 is not significantly larger than @xmath92 and thus the ratio of saturation scales is not changed too much by evolution . following these steps",

    "<S> this may be anticipated because , for a given @xmath1 , small @xmath6 logs are less important at lower energies . </S>",

    "<S> since these data are integrated over @xmath1 , the low @xmath1 region dominates and the cgc+nrqcd formalism at lo should apply . both lhc </S>",
    "<S> data and forward rhic data are well covered by our uncertainty band ; the central value for mid - rapidity rhic data however is slightly below the band . for this data point </S>",
    "<S> , our theory curves should have a larger systematic uncertainty because our framework is most reliable for dilute - dense collisions corresponding to high energies and forward rapidities . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : pt - pa ] and [ fig : y - pa ] are similar to those in p+p collisions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we should be able to describe the @xmath2 ratio , which we shall now discuss .    </S>",
    "<S> a key point is that the the large uncertainties for ldmes , feed down contributions and velocity corrections , largely cancel in the ratio of each nrqcd channel contributing to @xmath71 production . </S>",
    "<S> the band spanned by different channels should be able to bracket the @xmath2 value for @xmath38 production . with this method , the bounded value of @xmath2 extracted for @xmath38 production is independent of the ldmes and their statistical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially noteworthy since independent extractions of the ldmes from present data are not feasible ; their magnitudes , especially between the various co channels , can vary significantly . </S>",
    "<S> finally , since the cem is a special case of nrqcd with the choice of certain ldmes @xcite , our calculation of @xmath2 will also cover the range of cem predictions . </S>",
    "<S> in this sense , the range of theoretical estimates of @xmath2 for @xmath0 production are independent of the @xmath38 hadronization model and are directly sensitive to the short distance physics .    </S>",
    "<S> we will employ here the principal channels for @xmath38 production given by nrqcd power counting  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : rpa - alice ] and [ fig : rpa - rhic ] , where a 5% systematical error is assumed for each channel to account for the approximation in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 of all co channels approaches 1 at high @xmath1 , confirming that condition eq .   </S>",
    "<S> indeed is satisfied by the full theoretical calculation . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 of the cs channel @xmath19}}}}$ ] increases to be larger than 1 at high @xmath1 . since forming a color singlet requires two gluons from the target , the additional gluon exchange from the nucleus , at high @xmath1 , is enhanced relative to that from a proton ( by an amount that is proportional asymptotically to the ratio of their saturation scales at the rapidity of interest ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as we find the contribution of the cs channel is small relative to the co terms in both p+p and p+a collisions , it does not affect our estimate of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the band representing the @xmath2 spanned by the co channels corresponds to our result for @xmath2 of @xmath0 production .    </S>",

    "<S> our results suggest that the @xmath2 data , in a future global analysis within the cgc / nlo+nrqcd framework , can help constrain the ldmes more stringently , thereby providing a further test of nrqcd .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we have shown here that @xmath0 spectra in p+a collisions both at rhic and the lhc are well described by our cgc+nrqcd computations . </S>",
    "<S> the two free non - perturbative parameters are related by eq .  ; </S>",
    "<S> further , the value of the initial nuclear saturation scale @xmath46 is consistent with the values that best describe fixed target e+a dis data . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the @xmath2 @xmath1 data lie within the bands spanned by our computations for the different color octet channels is a strong evidence for the robustness of our framework since these curves are insensitive to details of how heavy quark pairs hadronize to form the @xmath0 . the results in this paper , when combined with those in @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> several outstanding questions remain . </S>",
