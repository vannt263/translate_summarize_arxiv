    "the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) revealed a great wealth of new objects with soft x - ray spectra .",
    "our optical identification of a sample of these sources has led to a significant increase in the number of known polars ( beuermann 1998 , thomas et al .",
    "detailed x - ray and optical follow - up studies allow us to determine their orbital periods , magnetic field strengths , accretion geometry , etc .",
    "this leads to a largely increased data base of known polars which is important for studying the general properties of these systems as well as their evolution .",
    "apart from this it is important to study individual objects in great detail as many of the new systems have remarkable characteristics such as extremely short periods and high magnetic field strengths ( see burwitz et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "rxj0501.7 - 0359 (= 1rxsj050146.2035927 ) was detected as a soft ( hardness ratio @xmath6 ) , bright ( @xmath7 cts / s ) , and variable x - ray source in the rass ( voges et al .",
    "1996 ) . as its optical counterpart ,",
    "we have identified an eclipsing @xmath0mag polar located at ra = @xmath8 , dec = @xmath9 .    here , we present the analysis of our large amount of follow - up observations of this new object : optical v - band ccd photometry with the dutch 0.9-m telescope and time - resolved spectroscopy with efosc2 at the eso / mpi 2.2-m telescope on la silla , chile , infrared j , h , and k photometry with magic at the 3.5-m telescope on calar alto , spain , and x - ray data with rosat using both the pspc and the hri .",
    "the optical light curves show a strong modulation which could be caused either by cyclotron beaming or by variations of the effective emitting area of the accretion stream as seen from different angles during the orbit .",
    "the light curve also features a deep total eclipse of the accreting white dwarf and the stream by the secondary star and a pre - eclipse dip , possibly due to the accretion stream crossing our line - of - sight towards the accretion region ( cf .",
    "[ licu ] , top panel ) .    from our optical , ir , and spectrophotometry ,",
    "we have derived 16 mid - eclipse timings between august 1993 and january 1996 .",
    "these were used to determine the orbital period of rxj0501.70359 very precisely and lead to the following ephemeris : @xmath10 from the optical spectra we have determined radial velocities of the narrow and broad components of the balmer ( h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 ) and the heii4686   emission lines .",
    "the average radial velocity curve yields an amplitude k@xmath13km / s for the narrow component ( cf .",
    "[ rvcurve ] ) .",
    "maximum redshifts of the broad and narrow components occur at orbital phases 0.02 and 0.12 , respectively .",
    "assuming a roche - lobe filling secondary star , kepler s laws define a relation between the orbital period @xmath14 of a cv and the mass @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 of the secondary ( eq . 1 in beuermann et al .",
    "1998 ) . as rxj0501.7 - 0359 is probably a system which has been born in the period gap , its secondary can not be much evolved . therefore , the theoretical mass - radius relation for zams stars with solar metallicity ( baraffe et al .",
    "1998 with fit parameters from beuermann and weichhold 1998 , eq .",
    "5 ) provides a valid second relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "combining both equations gives the mass - period relation @xmath17 from which we obtain @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the mass and radius of the secondary in rxj0501.7 - 0359 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding mass - function is shown in fig .  [ masses ] .",
    "the duration of the eclipse , @xmath20min @xmath21 , provides a second constraint for the inclination @xmath22 and the mass ratio @xmath23 in this system ( see fig .",
    "[ masses ] ) . combining both constraints the valid values for @xmath22 and @xmath24",
    "are restricted to the very narrow ranges @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ masses ] ) . finally , using @xmath27 and @xmath24 we get @xmath4 for the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "besides atomic emission lines , our optical spectra of rxj0513.70359 generally show a smooth continuum ( top and middle panel in fig .",
    "[ ospec ] ) . only during one observing run",
    "some hump structure might be present during the orbital phases 0.80.95 ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ ospec ] ) .",
    "we have tentatively identified these features as the 5th and 6th cyclotron harmonics corresponding to a magnetic field strength of @xmath5 mg in the accretion region . given the weakness of the possible cyclotron signatures ,",
    "the field strength of rxj0501.7 - 0359 , however , has still to be regarded as uncertain .",
    "the x - ray data show a very strong modulation with a bright phase lasting for about half of the orbital cycle ( phases 0.350.75 , cf .",
    "[ licu ] ) .",
    "this on - off modulation is most likely caused by the accretion pole disappearing behind the limb of the white dwarf .",
    "two component ( blackbody + thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath28kev fixed ) model fits to the rosat pspc x - ray spectra which cover mainly the bright phase yield a blackbody temperature @xmath29ev with an absorption column density of @xmath30atoms/@xmath31 which is slightly above the galactic value of @xmath32 ( 3@xmath33 errors are given ) .",
    "the accretion geometry of rxj0501.70359 appears to be intriguing as the x - ray bright phase occurs around the superior conjunction of the white dwarf .",
    "this implies that the visible accreting pole must be located on the white dwarf hemisphere pointing away from the secondary star .",
    "we thank the rosat team for its enduring work which resulted in the all - sky - survey data base and the staff at the la silla and calar alto observatories for their competent assistance during our observing runs .",
    "this work was supported by the dlr under grant 50or92105 and , in part , by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft under grant re 1100/3 - 1 .",
