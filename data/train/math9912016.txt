    "+ if @xmath6 , @xmath120 is quasihomogeneous by results of victor goryunov in @xcite when @xmath20 and by our proposition  [ classification ] when @xmath50 . + suppose @xmath502 has more than one branch . if @xmath32 is not transverse to @xmath538 , then by [ classi ] , either @xmath22 and @xmath32 are both prisms on morse singularities , or @xmath120 is equivalent to @xmath342 for some @xmath0-codimension 1 germ @xmath161 . in the first case",
    "@xmath120 is plainly quasihomogeneous . in the second ,",
    "we apply the inductive hypothsis to conclude that @xmath161 is quasihomogeneous .",
    "since we are in the nice dimensions , @xmath161 has a quasihomogeneous versal unfolding @xmath649 , and by [ morpri ] , @xmath120 is equivalent to @xmath342 .",
    "clearly this is quasihomogeneous .    if @xmath22 is transverse to @xmath539 and vice versa , then by [ banana ] the pullback @xmath161 of @xmath22 by @xmath539 , and the pull - back @xmath295 of @xmath32 by @xmath538 , both have codimension 1 . by the induction hypothesis , @xmath161 and @xmath295 are both quasihomogeneous . by [ bin ]",
    ", @xmath159 is equivalent to @xmath340 ; again , as we are in the nice dimensions , @xmath161 and @xmath295 have weighted homogeneous @xmath0-versal unfoldings with unfolding parameter with positive weight ; a representative of @xmath340 constructed from these ingredients is evidently weighted homogeneous . in the next result , we do not distinguish between @xmath19 and @xmath18 , for the reasons described at the start of section [ concatenation ] .",
    "the proof follows exactly the same scheme as the preceding proof .",
    "the starting point for the induction is now the fact that mono - germs of @xmath0-codimension 1 have @xmath19 or @xmath18 equal to 1 , by our proposition [ rep ] for @xmath8 , and by the fact ( proved in @xcite ) that @xmath877-codimension in the nice dimensions , for quasi - homogeneous germs @xmath38 with @xmath9 .",
    "since the result is already proven in case all branches have @xmath9 , we assume at least one branch has @xmath8 .",

    "the conclusion now follows by theorem [ conc1](2 ) for @xmath342 and by theorem [ conc2](3 ) for @xmath340 .",
    "again , the proof is by induction on @xmath873 .",
    "the result is proven for mono - germs in @xcite ( for @xmath9 ) and in [ rep ] above for the case @xmath50 .",
