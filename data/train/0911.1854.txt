    "since its experimental realization , bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases has been offering opportunities to research macroscopic quantum phenomena .",
    "especially , one of the most fascinating macroscopic quantum phenomena is the josephson effect between two bose - einstein condensations(becs ) trapped in a double - well potential , which is called the bose - josephson junction(bjj ) .",
    "bjj has been realized experimentally , which allowed direct observation of the dynamics of macroscopic wavefunctions directly@xcite .",
    "though in bjj the spatial coherence of becs is focussed , the josephson effect occurs not only between spatial separated becs but also between internal degrees of freedom in a single bec . in particular , the josephson - like effects between atomic and molecular states have been discussed theoretically@xcite@xcite@xcite . in this paper , we consider atom - molecule becs in a double - well potential . in this two component bjj ,",
    "the internal atom - molecule tunneling has significant influence on the ground state property and dynamics .",
    "as shown later , this internal tunneling induces the localized ground states . as for the dynamics",
    ", the multi - degree of freedom of this system permits chaotic dynamics , by adding the atom - molecule tunneling as a new degree of freedom .",
    "first , we explain the semiclassical dynamics of bjj . in a single component bjj ,",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom are the relative particle number and the relative phase , so the dimension of the system is two . since the trajectories in the phase space can not intersect with each other , significantly complex trajectories",
    "can not exist in 2d systems .",
    "however , in higher dimensional systems , the trajectories in the phase space travel around much more freely than 2d dynamical systems .",
    "this leads to richer dynamical behaviors in a two component bjj , and the chaotic dynamics can occur .    in general full - quantum systems , although the chaotic dynamics can not occur(see ref . 5 and references there in )",
    ", the quantum signature of the semiclassical non - periodicity appears in the level spacing distribution@xcite . in our system",
    ", we can control the multiplicity of degrees of freedom by varying the atom - molecule internal tunneling strength .",
    "based on these considerations , we investigate the statistical property of energy spectra and compare the semiclassical and full - quantum dynamics .",
    "in this section , we explain our model and approximations . the second - quantized hamiltonian for bose atoms and molecules",

    "furthermore , we introduce the four - mode approximation , which concentrates on condensate modes only , and neglect the effect of the particles occupying other modes . then , field operators can be approximated as @xmath8 , where @xmath9(@xmath10 ) are the wavefunctions of the atomic(molecular ) condensate modes in the left well and the right well respectively .",
