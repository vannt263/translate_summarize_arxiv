    "field theories in two spatial dimensions have long been recognized as important for understanding several physical phenomena that can be well approximated as planar ones , such as high temperature superconductors and the fractional quantum hall effect . in the last years",
    "there has been an enormous interest in these two dimensional systems in condensed matter physics . in particular ,",
    "a large number of important new phenomena discovered recently in condensed matter lies in this class .",
    "as examples we can cite the metal - insulator transition ( mit )  @xcite and graphene , an isolated single atomic layer of carbon , in which electron transport is essentially governed by dirac s relativistic equation  @xcite .",
    "it is then feasible to treat many of these planar ( or quasi planar ) systems in condensed matter in terms of quantum field theory models for fermions in 2 + 1 dimensions ( two space like and one time like coordinates ) .    among the many field theory models useful for understanding a plethora of phenomena in condensed matter systems , those that include a four - fermion interaction",
    "have been extensively used in the context of studies of planar systems . in particular ,",
    "nambu - jona - lasino type of models  @xcite in 2 + 1 dimensions and , among them , the gross - neveu ( gn ) model  @xcite , have been employed to study these systems .",
    "for example , the gn model has been considered as an appropriate model to study low energy excitations of high temperature superconductors  @xcite , while analogous models with generic quartic fermionic interactions have also been used to study quantum properties of graphene  @xcite .    in these planar systems , gn field theory models for fermionic interactions",
    "are commonly used to study their symmetry properties , in particular chiral symmetry breaking and restoration , at finite temperature and densities and also in the presence of external ( magnetic ) fields . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in investigating the effects of how an `` asymmetrical doping '' can affect the chiral symmetry , or the metal - insulator transition in a gn type of model for a two - dimensional system of fermions .",
    "an asymmetrical doping can be defined as an imbalance between the chemical potentials of the electrons with the two possible spin orientations (  up \" @xmath0 , and  down \" @xmath1 ) inserted in the system by a doping process .",
    "since the densities of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons are directly proportional to their chemical potentials , an asymmetrical doping is equivalent to an asymmetry in the chemical potentials for spin up and spin down electrons .",
    "this chemical potential asymmetry can be produced by the effect of an external magnetic field parallel to the system s two - dimensional plane .",
    "a magnetic field applied parallel to the system s two - dimensional plane couples only to the spin of the electrons , but not to the electrons orbital motion .",
    "therefore , landau levels that would appear due to the coupling of a ( perpendicular to the plane ) magnetic field to the electrons orbital motion do not appear here .",
    "instead , the in - plane magnetic field generates an intrinsic zeeman effect which polarizes the system .",
    "this is because at zero magnetic field electrons with spin up and spin down have the same density , but an in - plane magnetic field , due to the zeeman effect , causes a difference between the spin up and spin down densities .",
    "recent studies in the context of graphene  @xcite have suggested that the zeeman effect can be very important for the electronic properties of these systems .",
    "the intrinsic zeeman effect is thus useful to reveal the important role played by the spin degree of freedom of the electron and the polarization of the system  @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on the properties of a planar system modeled by a gn four - fermi interacting model and study how a spin density asymmetry influences on the chiral symmetry of the system , _ i.e. _ on the role of the zeeman contribution to the system s magnetization .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the gn model and the effect of including an in - plane constant magnetic field and the zeeman effect . in sec .",
    "iii we evaluate the landau s free energy ( the effective potential ) of the model and determine how the chiral symmetry is affected by the spin density asymmetry . in sec .",
    "iv we determine the magnetic properties of the system . finally , in sec .",
    "v we present our concluding remarks .",
    "we start by considering a planar four - fermi model describing interacting fermions with a lagrangian density given by    @xmath4 & = & \\sum_{s=\\uparrow,\\downarrow } \\bar{\\psi}^s \\left ( i   \\hbar \\partial_t - i \\hbar v_f \\vec{\\gamma}. \\vec{\\nabla } \\right ) \\psi^s \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{s=\\uparrow,\\downarrow }   \\frac{\\lambda}{2n}\\hbar v_f \\left(\\bar{\\psi}^s\\psi^s\\right)^2\\ ; , \\label{lag4f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is a four - fermion field with @xmath6 flavors and @xmath7 is an internal symmetry index ( spin ) that determines the effective degeneracy of the fermions . in eq .",

    "this is because the metastable region seen in ref .",
    "@xcite was considerable smaller than the one in the one - space dimensional gn model , so its contributions to our derivations should , likewise , be small .",
    "as we have already seen , the imbalance in the chemical potentials of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons are induced by the application of a static in - plane magnetic field in the system , with a zeeman energy @xmath118 and , in the present case , @xmath119 . as a consequence , the number densities @xmath120 and @xmath121 , defined by    @xmath122    are obviously imbalanced due to the asymmetry between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and will depend on @xmath42 . likewise , the spin polarization of the system as a result of the zeeman effect produces a net ( pauli ) magnetization of the system , which is defined by  @xcite    @xmath125    and a magnetic ( pauli ) susceptibility ,    @xmath126    note that the polarization state of the system is determined by the asymmetry , which depends on the intensity of the applied magnetic field .",

    ", the change in behavior can be quite remarkable , mostly when the susceptibility as a function of temperature is concerned .",
    "let us start by presenting some results for the number densities for fermions of spin up and spin down , as given by eq .",
    "( [ nud ] ) .",
    "we consider first the case of @xmath127 which represents the undoped system , _",
    "i.e. _ , the insulating state at which @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath127 we have effective chemical potentials given by @xmath128 and @xmath129 . from eq .",

    "if @xmath133 , there are non - vanishing densities , but they are always equal ( @xmath134 ) , resulting again in @xmath132 .",
    "this means that the undoped ( insulating ) system , for which @xmath127 , is never magnetized ( polarized ) at any temperature .",
    "so , let us then consider the cases where @xmath135 . in fig .",
    "[ nudfig ] we show how the spin up and down fermion densities ( in units of @xmath136 ) change with the asymmetry ( _ i.e. _ , when the applied magnetic field increases ) , for a chemical potential chosen here , as an example , as @xmath137 and for temperatures @xmath138 ( solid and dashed lines , for @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively ) and for @xmath141 ( dash - dotted and dotted lines , for @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively ) . note that in both cases @xmath140 initially decreases with the increasing magnetic field , vanishing at the full polarization point @xmath142 , as expected , and starts increasing again beyond that point .",
    "this is when the magnetic field becomes strong enough to be energetically favorable to spin down fermions of the filled valence band to be promoted to the conduction band .",
    "this occurs only at finite temperature , since at zero temperature @xmath143 is always zero at and beyond the critical magnetic field @xmath144 ( or the full polarization point )  @xcite .",
    "note that the spin up fermion density always increase with the applied magnetic field ( which is in the same direction of the spin up fermions ) .",
    "the plots also indicate that the rate of spin down fermions turning into spin up ones ( below the full polarization point ) as the result of increasing the applied magnetic field is constant and is approximately the same rate of promotion ( above the full polarization point ) of spin down fermions of the valence band to the conduction band .",
    "another result we can notice from fig .",
    "[ nudfig ] is that the difference of the two densities , _",
    "i.e. _ the pauli magnetization eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) , is always positive with the increasing magnetic field .",
    "this is true for any other values of chemical potential and temperature .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ magfig ] we present the results for the pauli magnetization , expressed in units of @xmath145 , for different values of temperature ( and again fixing the chemical potential as @xmath146 for comparison purposes ) when the asymmetry is increased ( or , equivalently , in terms of the zeeman field @xmath90 ) .",
    "here we can easily see a clear change in behavior of the magnetization as the full polarization point is crossed .",
    "the most important observation we can notice from the results seen in the fig . [ magfig ] , it is that below the full polarization point , here given by @xmath147 ( which is the value of @xmath25 that we have considered in the analysis ) , the larger is the temperature , the larger is the rate of increase in the magnetization , while has an opposite behavior above the full polarization point .",

    "( [ chires ] ) , for the special case of @xmath170 .",

    "( [ chimu ] ) , together with those determining eq .",
    "( [ chibrok ] ) , show that there are two major regions of parameters , at zero temperature , that preclude the pauli magnetic susceptibility for attaining a value .",
    "we find that the pauli magnetic susceptibility jumps discontinuously from zero to the value given by eq .",
    "( [ chibrok ] ) , for @xmath166 , with @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and then it jumps again from the value given by eq .",

    "( [ chimu ] ) .",
    "this behavior for the magnetic susceptibility could in principle be tested experimentally , induced by either a change in chemical potential ( e.g. by increasing the doping concentration in planar systems ) or by an increase in the magnetic zeeman field ( thus increasing the spin asymmetry ) .",
    "we also note that , as we have seen in the previous section , since for any value of @xmath167 , the value of asymmetry @xmath181 will lead to the phase transition .",
    "this value of asymmetry corresponds to a critical magnetic field for the chiral phase transition . since @xmath182 , we find that this critical magnetic field is given by    @xmath183    where we have used that @xmath184",

    "to summarize , we have investigated the mean - field phase diagram of planar systems , that can be modeled with a four - fermi type of model , upon asymmetric doping .",
    "we have obtained the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility for this system .",
    "the analysis made in this work can be of relevance in studies of many planar systems of interest in condensed matter , such as , for example , organic conductors made of polymer films and graphene . in particular , regarding the zero temperature magnetic susceptibility of these systems , we have predicted that it can change abruptly from zero to the value given by eq .",
    "( [ chibrok ] ) , when increasing either the doping or the magnetic zeeman field , such that @xmath123 crosses a critical doping value given by @xmath85 .",
    "then , it can jump again abruptly up to the point given by eq .",
    "( [ chimu ] ) , with the minimum value attained for @xmath188 .",
    "this is a direct prediction of our results that could be tested experimentally .",
    "as far the dependence on temperature is concerned , we have obtained that the magnetic susceptibility can have quite different behaviors depending whether the system is below or above the full polarization point @xmath189 . below the full polarization point , @xmath190 , while in the chiral broken phase the magnetic susceptibility increases nonlinearly with the temperature , in the chiral symmetric phase it tends to a linear function of the temperature .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that there is still so few or none , to our knowledge , experimental results for the magnetic susceptibility of planar systems of the type that could be modeled by the model studied here , such as planar polymers or graphene , so to be able to compare with our findings .",
    "even so , despite the very different nature , we recall that there are measurements of the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility with the temperature for metal alloys , most notably titanium based  @xcite , that displays exactly the same behavior as we found here , increasing almost linearly with the temperature , while the sudden change in the susceptibility at the chiral phase transition point seems to be analogous to the behavior seen in the measured susceptibility of blue bronze ( k@xmath191moo@xmath192 ) @xcite and indicative of a peierls transition there .",
    "the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility changes again as we go above the full polarization point . for @xmath190",
    "the magnetic susceptibility decreases when the temperature increases .",
    "in particular , for high temperatures , @xmath193 , it obeys the curie - weiss law .",
    "the applied magnetic field is then determinant on the type of the behavior observed for the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "there is a critical magnetic field , proportional to the chemical potential ( the doping concentration ) that determines the two behaviors for the magnetic susceptibility as a function of the temperature .",
    "we recall that there is a similar behavior seen in pristine graphite  @xcite , where for low magnetic fields the magnetic susceptibility is observed to increase with the temperature , while for large fields it goes down with the temperature .",
    "the major difference there with what we see here is that graphite is diamagnetic , while our results reflect the behavior of a paramagnetic material .",
    "we hope that in the future there will be measurements of the pauli magnetic susceptibility for planar systems so to be able to more closely compare with the results we have obtained here .",
    "our results have also shown that the zeeman effect in these planar systems tends to weaken the chiral symmetry , thus , the insulating to metal transition may happen at a smaller critical temperature in the presence of a zeeman field .",
    "this behavior , due to an increasing magnetic zeeman field , is exactly the opposite to what is observed when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to these systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , in which case the chiral symmetry breaking becomes stronger by the effect of the magnetic field and , thus , the transition happens at a higher temperature in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "these two opposite effects caused by magnetic fields , when applied parallel or perpendicular to the system s plane , can be an useful tool to regulate the insulating / metal behaviors for these planar systems , when the parallel and perpendicular fields are applied simultaneously and independently , opening interesting possibilities for uses of these type of materials in practical applications as electronic devices .",
    "further studies on the magnetic properties of these systems we hope to make and to report on them elsewhere in the future .    finally , since in most realistic experiments the measured quantities of interest are related to electric transport",
    ", it is expected also in those cases the zeeman splitting to have important effects .",
    "however , a calculation of conductivity effects and transport properties can not be addressed with the methods we used here , based on the calculation of the effective potential ( free energy ) , which are more suitable for the analysis of the phase structure of the model . but based on experimental studies of an in - plane magnetic field , for example in graphene , the zeeman splitting has been shown to be important in both the spin transport and conductance fluctuations properties  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the zeeman splitting leads to the spectrum of the effective single - particle hamiltonian exactly as required by the observed pattern of quantization of hall conductivity  @xcite .",
    "these are interesting effects associated with the electronic transport properties of realistic systems , that we hope to present in the future and based on the model we have studied here .",
