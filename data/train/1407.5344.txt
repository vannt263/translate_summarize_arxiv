    "in the last decade , several brown dwarfs ( bds ) in the field have been identified as displaying low - gravity features attributable to youth ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . one could expect that a fraction of those young objects are unrecognized members of kinematic associations .",
    "however , the lack of parallax or radial velocity measurements for those objects prevents us from directly assessing their kinematics , which makes the identification of bd members to nearby young associations very hard .",
    "identifying such bds of known age would provide benchmarks to study the atmospheres of very low - mass bds that are known to have features similar to those of the few directly imaged giant exoplanets known today ( e.g. , ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to address this",
    ", @xcite developed the bayesian analysis for nearby young associations ii tool ( banyan  ii ) , a statistical analysis based on banyan  i @xcite that uses a naive bayesian classifier to identify low - mass star and bd candidates to membership in nearby young associations , even in the absence of radial velocity and parallax measurements . + simp  j215434541055308 ( simp  j21541055 hereafter ) is a new low - gravity bd that we discovered as part of the _ sondage infrarouge de mouvement propre _ ( simp ) .",
    "we briefly describe the simp survey in section  [ sec : simp ] , and then present a spectroscopic follow - up of simp  j21541055 in section  [ sec : spectro ] . in section  [ sec : lowg ] , we show evidence that this bd displays signs of low gravity , by comparing its near - infrared ( nir ) spectrum with low - gravity standards and by using the gravity classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "we finally use the banyan  ii tool to show that this young bd is a candidate argus association member ( section  [ sec : nyas ] ) .",
    "the simp survey @xcite has been initiated in 2006 to identify new nearby bds from their red optical - to - nir colors and high proper motions , by obtaining a second @xmath3-band epoch for 30% of the sky ( mostly in the southern hemisphere ) , 58 yr after the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "this was achieved by using the cpapir camera @xcite on both the ctio  1.5 m telescope and the observatoire du mont - mgantic 1.6 m telescope .",
    "the simp survey typically reached an astrometric precision of 015 and a photometric depth of @xmath4 . any source in the simp survey that satisfied at least one of three filters based on proper motion ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 color",
    "was selected for a spectroscopic follow - up : ( 1 ) @xmath7 @xmath8  and detected in @xmath9 with @xmath10 ; ( 2 ) @xmath7 @xmath8  and not detected in @xmath9 such that @xmath11 ; or ( 3 ) @xmath12 @xmath8  and not detected in @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath9 magnitudes were selected either from the _ supercosmos sky survey _ @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , or the catalina sky survey ( css ; @xcite ) , as available and in this order of preference .",
    "these criteria were designed to reject close - by m - type dwarfs as well as distant objects .",
    "a large number of new bd candidates have been identified this way , from which more than a hundred have been followed with nir spectroscopy and confirmed as new m5t3 very low - mass stars and bds , most of them having spectral types later than l0 . among those ,",
    "we have identified simp  j21541055 , an l4@xmath0 bd displaying signs of low - gravity .",
    "a few other simp discoveries have been highlighted in @xcite and @xcite , whereas remaining discoveries will be presented in an upcoming paper ( j. robert et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the nir spectrum of simp  j21541055 presented here was obtained on 2008 september 16 at the irtf ( program number 2008b054 ) , using spex in the prism mode with the 05 slit ( @xmath13 150 ) , covering the 0.82.5 @xmath5 m range .",
    "the source was moved along the slit in an abba pattern , with a total of 10 exposures of 180 s to achieve a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath14180 per resolution element .",
    "raw exposures were reduced and combined using the spextool package @xcite , and telluric corrections were applied in a standard way @xcite , using the a - type star hd  202990 observed immediately before the target and at a similar airmass .",
    "[ fig : nir_compb ]",
    "the nir spectrum of simp  j21541055 was visually compared with various nir spectral templates to assign it a spectral type and identify peculiar features , following the method of k. cruz et al .",
    "( in preparation ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "field templates were built for all spectral types in the m5t8 range by median - combining high - quality spectra that showed no peculiarities nor signs of unresolved binarity in the dwarfarchives .",
    "low - gravity templates were built from known l0@xmath15l4@xmath15 bds that were classified as low - gravity objects in the optical or the nir ( @xcite ; @xcite ; k. cruz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this comparison showed that simp  j21541055 matches the l4 templates better than any other spectral types .",
    "furthermore , the l4@xmath15 template is a better match than the field l4 .",
    "the key spectral regions that differentiate between those two templates are ; ( 1 ) the depth of the @xmath16 feature at @xmath141.25  @xmath5 m ; ( 2 ) the level of the red end of the @xmath3 band ( @xmath141.3  @xmath5 m ) ; ( 3 ) the triangular shape of the @xmath17 band ( 1.51.8  @xmath5 m ) ; and ( 4 ) the slope of the @xmath18 band plateau ( 2.152.3  @xmath5 m ) .",
    "we show a comparison of simp  j21541055 with the l4 and l4@xmath15 templates in figure  [ fig : spt_seq ] , with those four regions identified .",
    "the l4 and l4@xmath15 templates were built using five and two distinct spectra respectively .",
    "+ @xcite developed an nir classification scheme to determine spectral types in a way that should not be sensitive to surface gravity , using visual classification supplemented by the h@xmath19o indices , and then determined a gravity class using various spectroscopic indices sensitive to surface gravity .",
    "objects for which most low - gravity indices are strong are classified as very low - gravity ( vl - g ) objects , and those having only a few indices as intermediate - gravity ( int - g ) objects .",
    "those without significant signs of youth are classified as field gravity .",
    "we have used this scheme to classify simp  j21541055 , with the exception that we used solely visual classification to determine its spectral type .",
    "results are presented in table  [ tab : mass ] , as well as in figure  [ fig : allers ] .",
    "we find it is classified as an int - g bd .",
    "@xcite indicate that their int - g and vl - g classifications respectively correspond to the @xmath0 and @xmath15 classifications defined for optical spectra by @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we adopt l4@xmath0 as the nir spectral type of simp  j21541055 . obtaining a higher - resolution nir spectrum for this object would be useful in verifying that its alkali line equivalent widths are effectively weaker than normal .",
    "simp  j21541055 is detected in the allwise @xcite @xmath20 channel , but does not display signs of infrared excess .",
    "we also show that it displays the reddest @xmath21 nir color of all currently known l4 dwarfs ( figure  [ fig:2154 ] ) , an effect likely attributed to thicker clouds in its photosphere .",
    "it is suspected that low gravity ( youth ) can cause such thicker clouds @xcite .    ) compared with other known l4 bds ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although it is classified as int - g , it is the reddest l4 bd yet identified .",

    "we used the banyan  ii tool @xcite to verify if simp  j2154 - 1055 is a candidate member of nearby young associations .",
    "we used the 2mass and allwise astrometry , as well as data from the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; @xcite ) and measurements obtained with cpapir through the simp survey to calculate its proper motion ( table  [ tab : mass ] ) .",
    "we find that simp  j21541055 has a 83.8% probability of being a member of the argus association ( 3050  myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the argus association of stars was first identified by @xcite , which proposed that the open cluster ic  2391 was a part of it .",
    "@xcite used the method of convergent point proper motion to show that both associations shared common kinematics , thus confirming this hypothesis .",
    "this association currently has 11 known a0m5 bona fide members @xcite , from which the latest - type is the nearby star ap  col @xcite . @xcite also proposed three low - gravity l - type bds as candidate members to this association .",
    "since the probability for the argus membership of simp  j2154 - 1055 is derived from a naive bayesian classifier , it is expected to be biased when using dependent measurements as input observables ( such as is the case here , see detail in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we used the monte carlo contamination analysis presented in @xcite to obtain a probability of 20.5% that simp  j21541055 is a young false - positive from the field . in the present case ,",
    "the contamination and membership probabilities are almost exactly complementary , but this is not true in general . + in figure  [ fig : pm_graph ] , we show the proper motion of simp  j21541055 compared with those of known bona fide members in argus .",
    "since members are spread across a large portion of the sky , the direction of their proper motion can be different , however it is expected that the great circles corresponding to the motion of all members of a given moving group will pass close to the group s apex and antapex .",
    "the proper motion of simp  j21541055 thus seems consistent with a membership to argus , since its great circle is closer to the apex than 6/11 bona fide members .",
    "its very red @xmath40 colors ( figures  [ fig : allers ] and [ fig:2154 ] ) are also consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the banyan  ii tool allows us to predict that this object should have a distance of @xmath41  pc and a radial velocity of @xmath42  if it is a member of argus , or a distance of @xmath43  pc and a radial velocity of @xmath44  if it is a field object . using its 2mass and",
    "allwise apparent magnitudes , statistical distance , ames - cond isochrones and cifist2011 bt - settl atmosphere models @xcite we determined that , at the age of argus ( 3050  myr ; @xcite ) , simp  j21541055 has a predicted mass of 1011  @xmath2 .",
    "measurements of radial velocity and parallax will be needed to assert its membership .",
    "we present the discovery of a new young l4@xmath0 bd , identified as part of the simp survey .",
    "we classify it as intermediate - gravity bd following the nir gravity classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "we determine that it has an 84% probability of being an argus member .",
    "we estimate that if it is a member of the argus association with an adopted age of 3050  myr , its mass would be 10  @xmath45  0.5  @xmath2 , in the planetary - mass regime . adding this object to the currently known late - type low - mass stars and bds will help shape our understanding of the properties of low - gravity , low - pressure atmospheres reminiscent of those of giant , gaseous exoplanets .",
