    "their corresponding @xmath159 values are obtained from the unit vectors joining the vertex of the interaction and the geometric centres of the cells .",
    "the seeds are then combined into preclusters starting from that with highest transverse energy if their distance in the @xmath159 plane , @xmath161 , is smaller than 1 unit .",
    "the axis of the precluster is defined according to the snowmass convention @xcite , where @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) is the transverse - energy weighted mean pseudorapidity ( azimuth ) of all the seeds belonging to that precluster .    in a second step ,",
    "a cone of radius @xmath77 is drawn around each precluster and all the cal cells within that cone are combined to form a cluster .",
    "the axis of the cluster is defined according to the same prescription as for the preclusters but including all the cal cells belonging to that cluster . a new cone of @xmath77",

    "two clusters are merged if the overlapping energy exceeds 75% of the total energy of the cluster with the lower energy ; otherwise two different clusters are formed and the common cells are assigned to the nearest cluster . finally , a cluster is called a jet if the transverse energy as measured by the cal , @xmath164 , exceeds 10  gev . the angular variables associated with the @xmath160 jets",
    "are denoted by @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the following procedure was used to reconstruct the jet shape from the cal cells : for each jet the sum of the transverse energies of the cal cells assigned to the jet with a distance @xmath167 to the jet axis smaller than @xmath83 is determined , @xmath168 , and divided by @xmath169 . the jet shape",
    "as measured with the cal , @xmath170 , is thus defined as : @xmath171 where the sum runs over all the jets in the selected sample and @xmath86 is the total number of jets in the sample .    for the monte carlo events ,",

    "the transverse energy corrections to @xmath160 jets averaged over the azimuthal angle were determined using the monte carlo events @xcite .",
    "these corrections are constructed as multiplicative factors , @xmath186 , which , when applied to the @xmath187 of the @xmath160 jets give the ` corrected ' transverse energies of the jets , @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "these corrections mainly take into account the energy losses due to the inactive material in front of the cal .",
    "the jet shapes as measured with the cal are corrected to the hadron level using the monte carlo event samples .",

    "the reconstructed jet shapes are corrected for acceptance and smearing effects using the samples of monte carlo events of resolved and direct processes .",
    "the correction factors also take into account the efficiency of the trigger , the selection criteria , the purity and efficiency of the jet reconstruction , and the effects of energy losses due to the inactive material in front of the cal .",

    "@xmath194 is determined separately for each interval in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    for this approach to be valid , the uncorrected jet shapes in the data",
    "must be described by the monte carlo simulations at the detector level . as shown later , this condition is in general satisfied by both the pythia and herwig simulations although some disagreement is observed in the forward region in the case of inclusive jet production .",
    "the latter can be reduced by adjusting the relative contribution of direct processes and the fraction of gluon jets in both resolved and direct processes . in the simulated events a @xmath160 jet is classified as a quark or gluon jet depending on the type ( quark or gluon ) of the closest parton from the two - to - two hard subprocess .",
    "the following procedure was adopted to obtain the best description of the uncorrected jet shapes : a ) the relative contributions of resolved and direct processes were tuned by a fit to the measured rcal energy distribution in the data ; a distinct distribution of the energy deposit in the rear direction for resolved ( direct ) processes is expected due to the presence ( absence ) of the photon remnant ; b ) the fraction of gluon jets in direct and resolved processes was adjusted by a fit to the uncorrected jet shape .",
    "this procedure was applied separately for each @xmath3 and @xmath4 interval .",
    "the correction factors @xmath194 are taken from this tuned version of pythia .",
    "for the comparisons to the measurements presented in sections  6 and 7 the untuned version of pythia has been used .",
    "the correction factors do not show a strong dependence on @xmath3 or @xmath4 and differ from unity by less than 10% ( 5% ) for @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) . for @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) they can increase to 15% ( 30% ) .",
    "the dependence of the correction factors on the choice of fragmentation scheme , relative contributions of direct and resolved processes , fractions of gluon and quark jets in each process , and the inclusion of multiparton interactions in resolved processes was studied and found to be small .",
    "the resulting differences are taken into account as contributions to the total systematic uncertainty assigned to the measurements reported in the next sections .",
    "a detailed study of the sources contributing to the systematic uncertainties of the measurements was carried out .",
    "for each source , the largest change in the corrected value of @xmath189 ( indicated in parentheses ) at a fixed value of @xmath83 typically occurs at @xmath199 and the magnitude of the induced change decreases rapidly as @xmath83 increases :    * the correction functions to the jet shapes were calculated using the event samples of the untuned version of pythia ( @xmath200  3% ) . * using the herwig generator to evaluate the energy corrections to the jets and the correction functions to the jet shapes ( @xmath200  5% ) .",

    "the predictions of pythia for resolved plus direct processes without initial and final state parton radiation are also shown in figure  [ figdra1 ] . since the predicted jet shapes based on fragmentation only are significantly narrower than the measured ones , it is concluded that , at the transverse energies studied here , the shape of jets is mainly dictated by parton radiation and can not be explained by hadronisation alone .",
    "* comparison to the parton shower model predictions of quark and gluon jets *    the difference between quark and gluon jets is modelled in pythia by a leading - logarithm parton - shower approximation .",
    "the jet shapes , as predicted by pythia , for quark and gluon jets are shown separately in figure  [ figdra2 ] , together with the same data as in figure  [ figdra1 ] .",
    "the predictions of pythia for the two types of jets are computed separately for resolved and direct processes , and then averaged according to the cross sections given by pythia .",
    "the predicted jet shapes are broader for gluon jets than for quark jets in each region of @xmath3 and exhibit only a small dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "the differences in the predictions for resolved and direct processes ( see figure  [ figdra1 ] ) come mainly from the different fractions of quark and gluon jets in the final state depending on the @xmath3 region .",
    "this difference , in turn , originates from the different dominant two - body subprocesses . in the case of direct processes , where the dominant subprocess is photon - gluon fusion @xmath205",
    ", pythia predicts the fraction of quark jets to be 80 - 100% depending on @xmath3 . in the case of resolved processes ,",

    "the comparison of measurement and prediction ( see figure  [ figdra2 ] ) shows that the broadening of the jet shapes in the data as @xmath3 increases is consistent with an increasing fraction of gluon jets .",
    "therefore , one possible reason for the deviation between data and prediction is an underestimation of the fraction of gluon jets in the region @xmath211 by pythia .",
    "* comparison to model predictions including multiparton interactions *    an excess of transverse energy outside of the jet cone for jets with @xmath211 with respect to the expectations of pythia was observed in previous studies @xcite . since this excess may have some effect on the comparisons discussed so far ,",
    "its influence on the jet shape has been considered . in order to simulate an increased energy flow the pythia generator including mi was used ; the cutoff ( @xmath158  gev ) for the effective minimum transverse momentum for mi",
    "was tuned to reproduce the transverse energy flow outside of the jet cone in the data .",
    "the jet shapes predicted by pythia mi are also shown in figure  [ figdra2 ] . comparing with figure  [ figdra1 ]",
    ", it is observed that the effects of mi on the jet shape are very small in the region @xmath202 , increase gradually with @xmath3 and yield an improved description of the data in the region @xmath211 .",
    "the differences in the predicted jet shapes between pythia and pythia mi are considered as an estimate of the uncertainty in the simulation of the energy flow outside the jet cone due to a possible underlying event .",
    "the conclusions that the measured jet shapes are consistent with the dominance of resolved processes and that the parton radiation is the main mechanism responsible for the jet shape still hold when this uncertainty is taken into account .",
    "* comparison to model predictions for fixed @xmath83 *    figure  [ figdra3 ] shows the measured jet shape at a fixed value of @xmath212 , @xmath213 , as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the predictions of pythia for quark jets with and without mi span a band above the data , while those for gluon jets with and without mi span a band typically below the data .",
    "it is also seen that the effect of mi is larger as @xmath3 increases . the predictions for resolved plus direct processes",
    "are also shown in figure  [ figdra3 ] .",
    "the prediction of pythia fails to describe the relatively strong broadening of the measured jet shape for @xmath211 . as mentioned earlier",
    ", one reason might be that the fraction of gluon jets in the region @xmath211 is underestimated .",
    "however , when the effects of a possible underlying event are taken into account , using pythia mi , the measured broadening in the forward region is accounted for with the default fraction of gluon jets . note that , in any case , as @xmath3 increases the measured jet shape changes from a value close to the upper band ( quark jets ) to a value within the lower band ( gluon jets ) . it is concluded that the broadening of the measured jet shape as @xmath3 increases is consistent with an increase of the fraction of gluon jets independent of the effects of a possible underlying event .      the @xmath4 dependence of the jet shape is presented in figure  [ figdra4 ] .",
    "it is observed that the jets become narrower as @xmath4 increases . for @xmath215  gev the predictions of pythia for resolved or resolved plus direct processes reproduce the data reasonably well . in the lowest @xmath4 region , differences between data and the predictions are observed .",
    "again the predicted jet shapes for direct processes are narrower than for the data .",
    "pythia including resolved plus direct processes , but without initial and final state parton radiation , predicts jet shapes which are too narrow in each region of @xmath4 .",
    "these comparisons show again that parton radiation is the dominant mechanism responsible for the jet shape in the whole range of @xmath4 studied .",
    "the measured jet shape at a fixed value of @xmath212 , @xmath213 , shows a moderate increase with @xmath4 , as seen in figure  [ figdra5 ] .",
    "note that the jet shapes have been measured in ranges of @xmath4 and the data points in figure  [ figdra5 ] are located at the weighted mean in each @xmath4 range .",
    "the predictions for the dependence of the jet shape on @xmath4 in resolved processes reproduce the data except for the lowest @xmath4 data point . the predicted jet shape for direct processes is narrower than the data .",
    "the effects of a possible underlying event are estimated using the predictions of pythia mi .",
    "the inclusion of these effects improves the description of the data in the lowest @xmath4 data point , but otherwise does not alter significantly the @xmath4-dependence of the jet shape .",
    "lowest - non - trivial order qcd calculations of the jet shapes @xcite are compared to our measurements in figures  [ figdra6 ] and [ figdra7 ] .",
    "these predictions include resolved and direct processes , and use the cteq4 @xcite ( grv - ho ) proton ( photon ) parton densities . since the jet shape is computed only to the lowest - non - trivial order , @xmath216 , the predictions are subject to relatively large uncertainties due to the strong dependence on the renormalisation and factorisation scales . in the calculations shown here ,",
    "these scales have been chosen equal to @xmath4 .",
    "since the calculations include only up to three partons in the final state , not more than two partons can build up a jet . as a result",
    ", the overlapping and merging issues of the experimental jet algorithm are not reproduced in the theoretical calculation @xcite .",
    "an attempt was made to simulate these effects by introducing an ad - hoc @xmath96 parameter @xcite : two partons are not merged into a single jet if their separation in the @xmath159 plane is more than @xmath96 .",
    "the calculations of the jet shape shown in figures  [ figdra6 ] and [ figdra7 ] have been made for various @xmath96 values was suggested @xcite for the comparison between the measurements of cross sections and theoretical calculations , other values can be used in order to match the measured jet shapes . ] : for two fixed values of @xmath217 and @xmath218 , and for the value of @xmath96 which best reproduces the data @xcite .",
    "the fixed - order qcd calculations with a common value of @xmath217 reproduce reasonably well the measured jet shapes in the region @xmath202 and in the region @xmath219  gev . in the forward region , @xmath211 , and in the lowest @xmath4 region ,",
    "@xmath220  gev , the calculations with @xmath217 show significant deviations with respect to the data . the discrepancy is very similar to that observed between the predictions of pythia without mi and the data .",
    "however , a satisfactory description of the data can be obtained by leaving @xmath96 as a free parameter ( for each interval in @xmath3 ) . a crosscheck with the data which overlaid jets from different events showed that the minimum distance at which two jets are resolved as two distinct jets depends very little on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the variation of @xmath96 with @xmath3 can not be justified on these grounds .",
    "the use of different values of @xmath96 to describe the data in the forward and lowest @xmath4 regions may be mimicking the effects of qcd higher orders and of a possible underlying event , which at present are not included in the calculations .",
    "in addition , the comparison between the measured jet shapes , which are corrected to the hadron level , and the fixed - order qcd calculations at the parton level is subject to the uncertainty of hadronisation effects .",
    "the jet shapes have been measured for each of the two highest @xmath4 jets in the reaction @xmath221 .",
    "both jets are required to have @xmath2  gev and @xmath94 .",
    "the measurements have been integrated over four non - overlapping regions in @xmath3 of each jet .",
    "the results for @xmath189 are presented in figure  [ figdra8 ] and are compared to the predictions of pythia .",
    "the jet shape broadens as @xmath3 increases and is narrower than that of the inclusive jet sample ( see figure  [ figdra1 ] ) .",
    "the predictions for resolved or resolved plus direct processes describe reasonably well the measured jet shapes in all regions of @xmath3 .",
    "the predicted jet shapes for direct processes are narrower than for the data in the region @xmath222 , as expected from the dominance of resolved processes in that region .",
    "the comparison of the predicted jet shapes with the data in the region @xmath211 does not show the discrepancies observed in the inclusive jet photoproduction study .",
    "this difference is attributed to a suppression of the effects of a possible underlying event in the case of dijet events since the requirement of two high-@xmath4 jets increases the contribution from direct processes and , for resolved processes , decreases the leftover energy for the remnants .",
    "the broadening of the measured jet shapes in dijet photoproduction as @xmath3 increases is adequately reproduced by the predictions of pythia .",
    "in dijet photoproduction the contributions of resolved and direct processes can be separated @xcite by using the variable : @xmath223 where the sum runs over the two jets of highest @xmath4 and @xmath224 is the initial photon energy .",
    "this variable represents the fraction of the photon s momentum participating in the production of the two highest @xmath4 jets .",
    "the lo direct and resolved processes largely populate different regions of @xmath225 , with the direct processes concentrated at high values .",
    "the results for @xmath189 are presented in figure  [ figdra9 ] for both @xmath225 smaller and larger than 0.75 .",
    "it is observed that the measured jet shapes for @xmath226 are broader than those for @xmath227 . for the region of @xmath227 , the jet shapes as predicted by pythia",
    "including resolved plus direct processes describe well the data .",
    "the predictions of pythia for the region @xmath228 reproduce the data reasonably well though the latter are slightly broader .",
    "the inclusion of the effects of a possible underlying event as modelled with pythia mi leads to an improved description of the data in the region of @xmath226 and has a negligible contribution in the region of @xmath227 ( not shown ) .",
    "measurements of jet shapes in inclusive jet and dijet photoproduction in @xmath92 collisions at @xmath229  gev using data collected by zeus in 1994 have been presented .",
    "the jet shapes refer to jets at the hadron level with a cone radius of one unit in the @xmath159 plane and are given in the kinematic region defined by @xmath142 gev@xmath143 and @xmath192  gev .",
    "jets with @xmath190  gev and @xmath230 have been considered .",
    "the dependence of the jet shapes on @xmath4 and @xmath3 has been studied : the jet shape broadens as @xmath3 increases and narrows as @xmath4 increases . in dijet photoproduction ,",
    "the jet shapes have been measured separately for two regions of @xmath225 , the fraction of the photon s momentum participating in the production of the two jets of highest @xmath4 , @xmath226 and @xmath231 .",
    "these subsamples are dominated by resolved and direct processes , respectively .",
    "the jet shapes in the region @xmath228 are systematically broader than those in the region @xmath232 .",
    "leading - logarithm parton - shower monte carlo calculations of resolved and direct processes have been compared to the measured jet shapes .",
    "the predictions based on resolved or resolved plus direct processes describe reasonably well the measured jet shapes in the region @xmath202 for inclusive jet photoproduction and in the full region of @xmath3 for dijet production .",
    "the predictions including only direct processes are narrower than those measured in the data .",
    "the removal of initial and final state parton radiation in the monte carlo calculations gives rise to jet shapes which are too narrow compared to those of the data .",
    "the results are in agreement with the dominance of resolved processes and indicate that parton radiation is the dominant mechanism responsible for the jet shape in the @xmath4 range studied .",
    "the strong support and encouragement of the desy directorate has been invaluable .",
    "the experiment was made possible by the inventiveness and the diligent efforts of the hera machine group .",
