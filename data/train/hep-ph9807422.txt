    "because of its relatively simple structure the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite is one of the most popular models for studying the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and its restoration at finite temperatures or densities @xcite - @xcite",
    ". however , most of its predictions suffer from the fact that the model is a pure quark model without confinement , which in general leads to rather unrealistic scenarios . in mean field approximation for @xmath0",
    "we can distinguish three different cases @xcite :    case i : the phase transition is of second order .",
    "then for all densities there is a uniform phase of quarks .",
    "the quarks are massive at low densities and ( almost ) massless at high densities .",
    "the pressure is always positive and if we do not apply an external force to the system it will expand to arbitrarily large volumes , i.e. arbitrarily small densities .",
    "case ii : the phase transition is of first order . in this case there will be a regime in which two phases coexist . in general , this mixed phase consists of a low - density phase ( @xmath1 ) with massive and a high density phase ( @xmath2 ) with massless quarks .",
    "however , for @xmath3 we have again a uniform phase of massive quarks . as in case i ,",
    "low densities are energetically favored and quark matter is unstable against expansion .",
    "case iii : the phase transition is of first order , but with @xmath4",
    ". then the low - density component of the mixed phase is the vacuum , i.e. we find droplets of massless quarks surrounded by the non - trivial vacuum . at least in a schematic way",
    "this is very reminiscent of the mit bag model .",
    "the droplets are the energetically most favored configuration and therefore stable against expansion or collapse .",
    "in contrast , any uniform distribution of quarks at lower densities is unstable against break - up into the droplet - vacuum phase .",
    "this scenario was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite within a similar model .    for njl - like models it depends on the model parameters which of the three cases is realized .",
    "however , the non - existence of a uniform dilute gas of quarks in nature excludes the cases i and ii , which both predict such a phase , from being realistic . in case iii",
    "there is no stable uniform quark gas at low densities but instead we have the droplet phase . at least if we adopt the interpretation of quark droplets as schematic bag model baryons this seems to be the most realistic scenario of the model . in this article",
    "we want to discuss whether it is also compatible with `` realistic '' model parameters .",
    "to large extent this will be done following ref .",
    "we consider a lagrangian for quarks with @xmath5 flavors and @xmath6 colors interacting by njl - like four - fermion vertices : @xmath7              \\;-\\ ; g_v ( { \\bar\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\psi)^2   \\ . \\label{l}\\ ] ] the first two interaction terms ( scalar - isoscalar and pseudoscalar - isovector ) were taken from the original njl - lagrangian @xcite . since vector interactions are known to be important at finite densities , e.g. like in the walecka model @xcite , we have also included a vector - isoscalar term .",
    "linearising @xmath8 and @xmath9 about their thermal expectation values we can calculate the mean field thermodynamic potential ( per volume ) at temperature @xmath10 and chemical potential @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the hartree approximation .",
    "the result for @xmath0 and @xmath12 reads : @xmath13 \\,+\\ , \\frac{(m - m_0)^2}{4g_s } \\,-\\",
    ", \\frac{(\\mu-\\mu_r)^2}{4g_v } \\ , \\label{omf}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 .",
    "the integral is strongly divergent and has to be regularized .",
    "for simplicity we use a 3-dimensional sharp cutoff .",
    "the auxiliary variables @xmath15 ( `` constituent quark mass '' ) and @xmath16 are defined as @xmath17 and @xmath18 . since on the other hand the condensates @xmath19 and @xmath20 have to be calculated from the thermodynamic potential by taking the appropriate derivatives we encounter a selfconsistency problem .",
    "it can be shown that it is solved by the stationary points of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this can be used to eliminate @xmath16 for given values of @xmath11 and @xmath15 , @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we subtract a constant in order to shift the value of the minimum of the vacuum thermodynamic potential to zero , i.e. we define : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the constituent quark mass which minimizes the thermodynamic potential in vacuum . for a given value of @xmath11 the extrema of @xmath25 correspond to the selfconsistent solutions and the stable solution",
    "is given by the absolute minimum .",
    "other thermodynamic quantities , like the pressure @xmath26 , baryon number density @xmath27 and energy density @xmath28 , can be calculated from the thermodynamic potential in the standard way .",
    "with the appropriate choice of parameters chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the njl - vacuum , i.e. the quarks acquire a constituent mass @xmath24 much larger than the current mass @xmath29 . unless stated otherwise we will work in the chiral limit , @xmath30 .",
    "then the thermodynamic potential @xmath25 is symmetric about @xmath31 . in vacuum @xmath31",
    "corresponds to a local maximum and @xmath25 is minimal at @xmath32 . for large chemical potentials chiral",
    "symmetry becomes restored .",
    "thus , with increasing @xmath11 , the maximum at @xmath31 eventually has to turn into an absolute minimum .",
    "if this happens at a critical chemical potential less than the vacuum mass , @xmath33 , we have a first - order phase transition of the type `` case iii '' .",
    "an example for this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ omega ] where we find a critical chemical potential @xmath34 = 376 mev , well below the vacuum mass @xmath24 = 400 mev . since for @xmath0 and @xmath35",
    "the chemical potential is equal to the fermi energy of the system , for a given mass @xmath15 , a chemical potential less than @xmath15 corresponds to zero density and vice versa .",
    "hence the degenerate minima of @xmath25 at @xmath36 correspond to two phases of equal pressure in chemical equilibrium , one being the nontrivial vacuum ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and the second consisting of massless quarks at finite density . in our example",
    "we find @xmath39 for the dense phase .",
    "this means , droplets of massless quarks and a baryon number density of @xmath40 are stable in vacuum , as far as our mean field approach is justified .",
    "alternatively this can be seen if we calculate the energy per baryon number , @xmath41 as a function of density @xmath42 . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] for the same set of parameters as in fig .",
    "[ omega ] . at not too high densities",
    "there are solutions with massive and with massless quarks , and the massive ones are always energetically favored . in the limit @xmath43",
    "the energy per baryon number is just 3 times the constituent quark mass .",
    "however , in agreement with our considerations above we find the absolute minimum of @xmath41 at @xmath40 which is in the regime where only massless solutions exist . at this point",
    "the pressure vanishes and the energy per baryon number is 3 times @xmath34 .",
    "this shows again that @xmath44 is necessary for this minimum to be stable .",
    "the results can become qualitatively different if we change the model parameters .",
    "for instance , with the parameters of fig .",
    "[ omega ] but with a vector coupling @xmath45 we find a first - order phase transition at @xmath34 = 410.3 mev @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds to what we called `` case ii '' and there is no dense matter solution which can coexist with the vacuum .",
    "the energy per baryon number as a function of density looks similar to fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] , but with the minimum of the massless solutions being only metastable : the corresponding energy , @xmath47 , is now larger than the energy per baryon number for @xmath43 , which is @xmath48 . finally , if we further increase the vector coupling , e.g. @xmath49 , we find a second - order phase transition and the energy per baryon number is a strictly rising function of density .    a more systematic overview is given in fig .  [ binding ] where three lines of constant binding energy per quark , @xmath50 , are plotted .",
    "for each value of @xmath24 the cutoff @xmath51 was fixed by fitting the pion decay constant to its empirical value @xmath52 = 92.4 mev .",
    "we are left with two model parameters , which can be chosen to be @xmath24 and the ratio of vector and scalar coupling constant , @xmath53 .",
    "we see that the vector interaction reduces the binding , which is not surprising since vector mean fields are known to be repulsive .",
    "we also find that the binding becomes stronger with increasing constituent quark masses .",
    "for @xmath54 343 mev there is no bound quark matter , even without vector interaction .",
    "this agrees quite well with an approximate relation derived in ref .",
    "@xcite which states that stable quark matter is only possible in the njl - model if @xmath55 .",
    "the region shown in fig .",
    "[ binding ] corresponds more or less to the regime of `` realistic parameters '' .",
    "one could try to further constrain @xmath24 by fitting the quark condensate .",
    "however , @xmath19 is not known very precisely and its dependence on @xmath24 is only weak , once @xmath52 is fixed .",
    "the vector coupling constant could be determined by fitting vector meson masses . in the literature",
    "this usually leads to @xmath53 of the order of 0.5 to 1 @xcite although much higher values are also found @xcite . on the other hand a realistic vector coupling constant in dense matter",
    "could be rather different from the vacuum one .",
    "thus the scenario of stable quark droplets in vacuum ( `` case iii '' ) is possible but not a necessary or very probable consequence of restricting the model parameters to realistic values .",
    "this is in some contradiction to ref .",
    "@xcite where stable droplets are found to be most likely .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is almost identical to our model with @xmath35 , with the only difference that instead of using a sharp cutoff the vertices are multiplied with form factors of the form @xmath56 . as an example we looked at @xmath57 and @xmath51 = 800 mev .",
    "it turned out that we are able to produce very similar results with our model if we use a sharp cutoff of about @xmath58 mev .",
    "however , for this cutoff parameter we find a pion decay constant of less than @xmath59 mev .",
    "this suggests that the parameters chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite might also correspond to a too small value of @xmath52 .",
    "in case iii dense matter of massless quarks can coexist with the non - trivial vacuum .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction it is very attractive to identify these quark droplets with baryons in a bag - model picture .",
    "in fact , the energy of a spherical mit - bag @xcite with radius @xmath60 , @xmath61 has a similar structure as the energy per baryon number for massless quarks in the njl mean field @xmath62 if we switch off the vector interaction . here",
    "the bag constant is given by @xmath63 .",
    "of course our thermodynamic approach is valid only for a large number of particles in a large volume whereas eq .",
    "( [ emit ] ) was derived for three quarks in a volume which can be small .",
    "this leads to different coefficients in front of @xmath64 .",
    "however , taking @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite , the deviation turns out to be surprisingly small ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "one should also keep in mind that eq .",
    "( [ enjl ] ) is only valid for the massless quark solutions .",
    "as we have seen , if the density is low enough the quarks can lower their energy by acquiring a finite constituent mass ( cf .",
    "[ epsilon ] ) .",
    "in particular , only a finite amount of energy is needed to lower the density to zero , corresponding to an infinite bag radius : the njl mean field does not confine . as an important consequence the quark",
    "droplets become immediately unstable against evaporation of massive quarks at any finite temperature and one has to be very careful with the interpretation of the model for @xmath68 .",
    "in this section we extend the model to three quark flavors @xcite : @xmath69 \\nonumber \\\\              \\;&-&\\ ; k \\ , [ \\,det_f ( { \\bar\\psi}(1+\\gamma_5)\\psi )                            + det_f ( { \\bar\\psi}(1-\\gamma_5)\\psi ) \\ , ]    \\ . \\label{l3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath70 is a 3-dimensional vector and @xmath71 a @xmath72 matrix in flavor space .",
    "in addition to the 4-point interaction the lagrangian contains a thooft - type 6-point interaction which is a determinant in flavor space and breaks the @xmath73 symmetry . for simplicity we neglect vector interactions in this section . since each flavor",
    "is separately conserved we have in principle three different chemical potentials and the thermodynamic potential contains the term @xmath74 .",
    "is different from the strangeness chemical potential @xmath75 which is often introduced as the deviation from a common baryon chemical potential @xmath76 : @xmath77 . in particular in our notation @xmath78",
    "corresponds to @xmath79 . ]    in the following we consider non - strange isospin - symmetric matter , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath78 .",
    "we adopt the model parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite which have been fitted to the pseudoscalar mass spectrum and @xmath52 . for these parameters",
    "we find stable quark matter with @xmath82 and a binding energy per quark of @xmath83 mev .",
    "the energy per baryon number is plotted in fig .",
    "[ su3 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "because of the determinant interaction this result is influenced by the strange quark even though the net strangeness @xmath84 is zero . to show this we switch off the determinant interaction and increase @xmath85 such that the vacuum properties of the non - strange sector , @xmath86 , @xmath52 and @xmath87 , remain unchanged . the result is also shown in fig .  [ su3 ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "here the binding energy is @xmath88 mev at @xmath89 .",
    "thus the flavor mixing gives some extra binding but the effect is not very large .",
