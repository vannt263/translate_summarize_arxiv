    "the analogue of inequality ( [ eqn6a ] ) for polynomials not vanishing in the interior of a unit circle was proved in 1960 by rivlin @xcite , who in fact proved    [ theorem1.2a ] let @xmath20 in @xmath21 then for @xmath3 @xmath22 the inequality is best possible and equality holds for @xmath23 where @xmath24    govil @xcite generalized theorem [ theorem1.2a ] by proving    [ theorem3.1a ] let @xmath20 in @xmath21 then for @xmath25 @xmath26 the result is best possible and equality holds for the polynomial @xmath27    there are many extensions of inequality ( [ eqn46 ] ) ( see , for example govil , qazi and rahman @xcite , govil and qazi @xcite , and qazi @xcite ) .",
