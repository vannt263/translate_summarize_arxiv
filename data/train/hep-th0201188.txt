    "the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite indicates that our universe is globally isotropic to a very high degree of precision .",
    "therefore , our universe is usually assumed to be described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric in most of the literatures .",
    "the origin of the isotropic universe has also become an interesting research topic ever since .    on the other hand",
    ", it is known that there is a small large - angle cmb anisotropies , @xmath0 , under the cmb background @xcite .",
    "the isotropy of our universe may have to do with the choice of initial conditions and the stability of the evolutionary solutions .",
    "therefore , the present isotropic phase could be a dynamic result of the evolution of our universe , no matter what the initial state started out . in this paper",
    ", we will address on this issue in both the standard einstein s theory and the newly developed brane world scenario @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will consider the evolution of an anisotropic cosmology described by the bianchi type i models @xcite-@xcite for two different types of matter sources : one is the perfect fluid and the other one is a dilaton field .",
    "our result shows that the anisotropic models considered all evolve dynamically from the anisotropic bianchi type i universe into the isotropic frw space in the large time limit .",
    "this property reveals that the isotropy of the cosmological principle may be justified and made consistent with our current observational data .",
    "these two different theories give , however , completely different initial anisotropic expansion at the very early stage of evolution .",
    "indeed , for the conventional einstein s theory ( cet ) , the anisotropic expansion tends to be large in the very early stage . in another words ,",
    "the universe has to begin from a highly anisotropic initial expansion and then decays to zero as the time increases . on the other hand , in the brane world scenario @xcite-@xcite , due to the quadratic correction which significantly changes the early time behavior of the universe .",
    "as a result , any initially non - vanishing anisotropy parameter tends to vanish in the very early period .",
    "there is a characteristic time , @xmath1 , that divides the evolution of mean anisotropy parameter into two different stages .",
    "the mean anisotropy parameter is increasing when @xmath2 and reaches its maximal value at @xmath3 .",
    "after that , mean anisotropy parameter starts to decay .",
    "this result remains true for both the model with a perfect fluid and the model with a scalar field . and this appears to be a general feature independent of the types of matter considered .",
    "in addition , the stability analysis @xcite-@xcite indicates that all models in two different theories are all stable against any anisotropic perturbation .",
    "in particular , we also show that the system is stable against the dilaton perturbation when the dilaton potential is close to its local minimum .",
    "note that the exact solution is known only when the dilaton potential is a constant .",
    "this also justifies the stability of the isotropic universe in the large time limit under the effect of a dilaton potential with local minima .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the brane world formulation and the bianchi type i model .",
    "then we consider the evolution of the anisotropic cosmology and its stability in both theories of the cet and the brane world .",
    "analysis is presented for model coupled to a perfect fluid in section iii . the model with a dilaton field and a constant potential",
    "is presented in section iv .",
    "finally , the conclusion and possible implications are drawn in sec .",
    "the brane world scenario assumes that our universe is a four - dimensional space - time , a 3-brane , embedded in the 5d bulk space - time .",
    "all the matter fields and the gauge fields except the graviton are confined on the the 3-brane as a prior requirement in order to avoid any violations with the empirical results . moreover ,",
    "inspired by the string theory / m - theory , the @xmath4-symmetry with respect to the brane is imposed @xcite .",
    "a formal realization of the brane world scenario , which recovers the newton gravity in the linear theory , is the rundall - sundrum model @xcite in which the 4d flat brane(s ) is embedded in the 5d anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time .",
    "later on , a covariant formulation of the effective gravitational field equations on the 3-brane has been obtained via a geometric approach by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the effective four - dimensional gravitational field equations on the brane take the the following form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the einstein and energy - momentum tensors .",
    "@xmath8 is a quadratic contribution of @xmath7 defined as @xmath9 the effective 4d parameters , e.g. , the cosmological constant @xmath10 and gravitational coupling @xmath11 , are determined by the 5d bulk cosmological constant @xmath12 , the 5d gravitational coupling @xmath13 and the tension of the brane @xmath14 via the following relations @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the metric tensor on the brane . in addition , the quantity @xmath17 is a pure bulk effect defined by the bulk weyl tensor @xcite .",

    "( [ bweq ] ) , it is easy to realize that the brane world scenario is different from the cet by two parts : ( a ) the matter fields contribute local `` quadratic '' energy - momentum correction via the tensor @xmath8 , and ( b ) there are `` nonlocal '' effects from the free field in the bulk , transmitted via the projection of the bulk weyl tensor @xmath17 . therefore , the cet can be treated as a limit of the brane theory by taking @xmath18 and @xmath19 with properly adjusted values of the constants @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the generalized einstein equations ( [ bweq ] ) , the energy - momentum tensor also satisfies the conservation law @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , there is a constraint on the tensor @xmath17 , @xmath21 , due to the bianchi identity on the brane . here",
    ", the operator @xmath22 is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath23 on the brane .",
    "one should point out here that the field equations on the brane , namely the generalized einstein equations , the conservation of energy - momentum and the constraint on @xmath17 are , in general , not a closed system in the 4d brane since the quantity @xmath17 is five - dimensional .",
    "it can only be evaluated by solving the field equations in the bulk . in this paper , we will , however , only consider the quadratic effect on the brane world in the anisotropic background . therefore , we will set @xmath18 which is equivalent to embedding the 3-brane in the pure ads bulk space - time .",
    "another important subject in this paper is the anisotropic cosmology described by bianchi type i metric .",
    "the line element of the bianchi type i space , an anisotropic generalization of the flat frw geometry , can be written as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the expansion factors on each different spatial directions .",
    "for later convenience , we will introduce the following variables @xmath26 in addition , we will also introduce two basic physical observational quantities in cosmology : @xmath27 note that @xmath28 for an isotropic expansion . moreover , the sign of the deceleration parameter indicates how the universe expands .",
    "indeed , a positive sign corresponds to `` standard '' decelerating models whereas a negative sign indicates an accelerating expansion .",
    "in this section , we will consider the case that the matter energy - momentum tensor , @xmath7 , is a perfect fluid whose components are given by @xmath29 here the energy density @xmath30 and the pressure @xmath31 of the cosmological fluid obey a linear barotropic equation of state of the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 a constant in the range @xmath34 .",

    "hence the universe can be isotropized dynamically and undergoes an accelerated expansion in the large time limit due to the presence of a positive cosmological constant @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , the value of the cosmological constant can only change the expanding rate of the universe but will not affect its effect of isotropization in general .    in order to illustrate this point ,",

    "moreover , the mean anisotropy parameter @xmath60 is always non - vanishing independent of the values of @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the early universe is always anisotropic .",
    "therefore , for the universe with perfect fluid matter in the cet , the initial state is always anisotropic and this primordial anisotropy is smeared away as a consequence of the evolution of the universe .",

    "the same constraint for the perfect fluid conservation law ( [ grrho ] ) still holds on the brane .",

    "we will argue that the most complete stability conditions we are looking for can be obtained from class ( a ) and class ( b ) perturbations ; even the backreaction of the scalar field perturbation on the metric field perturbations is known to be important @xcite .",
    "we will show that this backreaction does not bring in any further restriction on the stability conditions .",
    "the reason is rather straightforward .",
    "one can write the linearized perturbation equation as @xmath161 for the system we are interested .",
    "moreover , perturbations are defined as @xmath162 and @xmath163 with the index @xmath164 denoting the background field solution .",
    "note also that the operators @xmath165 and @xmath166 denote the differential operator one obtained from the linearized perturbation equation with all fields evaluated at the background solutions .",
    "the exact form of these differential operators will be shown later in the following arguments .",
    "one is looking for stability conditions that the field parameters must obey in order to keep the evolutionary solution stable .",
    "one can show that class ( a ) and class ( b ) solutions are good enough to cover all domain of stability conditions .",
    "let us denote the domain of solutions to class ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( a+b ) stability conditions as @xmath167 , and @xmath168 respectively . specifically , the definition of these domains are defined by @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .    therefore , one only needs to show that @xmath172 .",
    "this is because that `` @xmath173 and @xmath174 '' imply that `` @xmath175 . ''",
    "on the other hand , `` @xmath176 '' does not imply that `` @xmath177 or @xmath178 . ''",
    "hence class ( a ) and class ( b ) solutions cover all the required stability conditions we are looking for . hence we only need to consider these two separate cases for simplicity .    in addition , one knows that any small time - dependent perturbation against the metric field is known to be equivalent to a gauge choice @xcite .",
    "this can be clarified as follows .",
    "indeed , one can show that any small coordinate change of the form @xmath179 will induce a gauge transformation on the metric field according to @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , a small metric perturbation against a background metric is amount to a gauge transformation of the form @xmath181 for the bianchi type - i metric with @xmath182 .",
    "this is then equivalent to small metric perturbations .",
    "if a background solution is stable against small perturbation with respect to small field perturbations , one in fact did nothing but a field redefinition .",
    "if the background solution is , however , unstable against small perturbations , e.g. , the small perturbation will grow exponentially as we will show momentarily , the resulting large perturbations can not be classified as small gauge transformation any more .",
    "therefore , the stability analysis performed in the literature @xcite for various models against the unstable background solution served as a very simple method to check if the system supports a stable metric field background .",
    "this is the reason why we still perform a perturbation on the metric field for stability analysis ; even a small perturbation is equivalent to a gauge redefinition .",
    "note that one should also consider a more general perturbation with space perturbation included .",
    "the formulation is , however , much more complicated than the one we will show in this paper .",
    "we will focus on the time - dependent case for simplicity in this paper .",
    "the space - dependent perturbation analysis is still under investigation .",
    "the time - dependent analysis alone will , however , bring us much useful information for the stability conditions about the model we are interested .",
    "for example , we will show in the following subsection that the solution found in ref .",
    "@xcite remains stable as long as the scalar field falls close to any local minimum of the potential @xmath132 .",
    "note again that the solution found in ref .",
    "@xcite is an exact solution only when @xmath183 constant .",
    "* dilaton perturbation *    let us consider the perturbation of the dilaton field of the following form @xmath184 by setting @xmath107 in the eqs .",
    "( [ sdh ] , [ sdv ] , [ ddphi ] ) , the field equations for @xmath185 become @xmath186 due to the fact that @xmath187 , the asymptotic solution of @xmath188 can be shown to be @xmath189.\\ ] ] here @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , the perturbation of dilaton field decays to zero if @xmath191 .",
    "hence we show that the system is stable with respect to the scalar perturbation if @xmath191 such that the scalar potential is capable of confining the scalar field to its local minimum .",
    "note that there are two additional equation @xmath192 and @xmath193 which is required for consistency of the stability of the system .",
    "these constraints simply imply that the scalar field must be at rest at the local minimum of the scalar field potential . as we have pointed out earlier that the background solution we have at hand is an exact solution for the model with a constant cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , the background solution we used for stability analysis is only an approximated solution which remains valid only when the scalar field is close to the local minimum of the the scalar field potential . as a result",
    ", one should not be too serious about these two further constraints .",
    "in fact , these constraints are both negligible in the large time limit when the scalar field falls close to the local minimum of the scalar field potential , namely , @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "hence one is able to show that these additional constraints can be made satisfied approximately in the large time limit .    * metric perturbation *    using the metric perturbation ( [ qper ] ) , the perturbation equations for the metric perturbation @xmath104 can be obtained from perturbing the eqs .",
    "( [ sdh ] , [ sdv ] , [ ddphi ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath196 here we also choose the limit @xmath107 .",
    "note that the background variables @xmath197 and @xmath198 approach @xmath199 therefore , the asymptotic behavior of the metric perturbation @xmath104 can be found from the second equation .",
    "in addition , the other two field equations will provide a constraint for the system .",
    "the results are @xmath200 hence , the metric perturbation @xmath201 in the large time limit .",
    "this indicates that the background solution of the system is stable against the metric perturbation as shown above .",
    "we have discussed the anisotropic property of cosmological models in the cet and brane theory .",
    "a realistic model , being consistent with the current observations , should produce a small value of anisotropic parameter at the later stage of the evolution of our universe near the last scattering surface . by assuming the bianchi type i space - time for the evolution of our universe",
    ", we found that the final state of the evolving universe always approaches the phase of isotropic expansion in both theories .",
    "these two different theories give completely different initial anisotropy at the very early stage of evolution .",
    "indeed , for the cet , the anisotropy tends to be large in the very early stage . in another words",
    ", the universe tends to begin from a highly anisotropic initial state .",
    "the mean anisotropy parameter @xmath60 will then decay to zero as the time increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the early time behavior of the universe in the brane world scenario changes significantly due to the quadratic correction on the brane . as a result",
    ", any non - vanishing mean anisotropy parameter , @xmath159 , tends to vanish in the very early period .",
    "there is a characteristic time , @xmath1 , that divides the evolution of @xmath159 into two different stages .",
    "the mean anisotropy parameter is increasing when @xmath2 and reaches its maximal value at @xmath3 .",
    "after that , @xmath159 starts to decay .",
    "this kind of behavior is clearly shown in the fig.[fig : f2 ] and fig.[fig : f5 ] .",
    "this result remains true for both the model with a perfect fluid and the model with a scalar field . and this appears to be a general feature independent of the types of matter considered .",
    "it is worth noting that the only exception is the model with @xmath202 ( i.e. @xmath64 ) of the perfect fluid model .",
    "the mean anisotropy of this model behaves similar to the models in the cet where mean anisotropy parameter is large in the very early time .",
    "moreover , we also analyzed the stability problem for those exactly solved anisotropic models shown in this paper .",
    "the result indicates that all of the solution known to us are stable in the large time limit .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the universe in the cet starts with highly initial anisotropic expansion .",
    "the dynamic of the system will take the universe to the phase of isotropic expansion in the large time limit .",
    "we also show that the final isotropic expansion will remain stable in the large time limit .",
    "in addition , the mean anisotropy parameter will keep decreasing as time increases . the model provided here is a useful and explicit model that is capable of providing us with a universe that has a tiny anisotropy left over near the last scattering surface .",
