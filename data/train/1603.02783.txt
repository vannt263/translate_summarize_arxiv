    "a coin toss is often used as a method for choosing randomly between two options .",
    "it is also a familiar model of a random outcome when learning probability and statistics .",
    "however , the motion of a tossed coin is completely deterministic , meaning that given the set of initial conditions we can calculate the exact outcome using the laws of physics .",
    "various literature on the dynamics of a coin explore these conflicting ideas .    in 1986 , keller studied an ideal two - dimensional coin : a thin disk whose rotation axis is parallel to the floor .",
    "he proved that for a two - dimensional coin tossed and caught in hand before a collision , the probability of getting either heads or tails approaches .5 in the limit of possible initial velocities @xcite .",
    "diaconis , holmes , and montgomery showed that a three - dimensional coin , a disk with no restriction on its rotation axis , is slightly biased by .01 to land on the side it was held at the initial position @xcite .",
    "if we allow the coin to bounce on the floor , the analysis of the qualitative behavior of the coin gets highly nontrivial .",
    "vulovic and prange carried out computer simulation to prove that a small perturbation of the initial velocities of a two - dimensional bouncing coin can lead to very different outcomes @xcite .",
    "strzalko et al .",
    "published a similar numerical result for a three - dimensional coin @xcite .",
    "another motivation for studying a coin comes from the billiards theory . in the 1960s",
    ", the billiard problem appeared in the context of statistical mechanics to study a system of spherical gas particles in a box to verify the boltzmann ergodic hypothesis @xcite .",
    "more recently , non - spherical particles , which have rotational in addition to translational velocities , were studied to build a more realistic gas model @xcite . in this direction , it became natural to consider the behavior of a billiard ball with two degrees of freedom @xcite . before understanding the full dynamics of a two - dimensional billiard object moving in some general planar domains , we study the object interacting with a simple flat boundary .",
    "we consider an object consisting of two equal masses connected by a weightless rigid rod ( figure 3a ) .",
    "we assume the object moves under the influence of gravity and makes elastic collisions at the flat boundary .",
    "note that this system can be viewed as an equivalent model to a system of a two - dimensional bouncing coin .",
    "we use this coin model since it gives us relatively convenient constants for our analysis . using a different two - dimensional coin model such as an actual thin disk ( the aforementioned keller model ) or a rod will not change the main results in this paper . in that case , we will only need to modify the moment of inertia of the system and a few other related constants .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically prove the existence of a chaotic behavior of this two - dimensional coin model . unlike a realistic situation where a coin eventually rests",
    ", our coin does not stop bouncing .",
    "therefore , we can not discuss the randomness based on its final position .",
    "instead , we study the infinite sequence of coin bounces .",
    "we prove that the two - dimensional bouncing coin can produce any infinite sequence of collisions . in this sense",
    ", we may consider the two - dimensional coin with collisions a good randomizer .",
    "consider a two - dimensional coin consisting of two equal masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 connected by a weightless rod in the @xmath2 plane ( figure 3a ) .",
    "suppose the coin moves in @xmath3 under the influence of gravity g , and makes elastic collisions at @xmath4 .",
    "if a collision of @xmath0 or @xmath1 is labeled by @xmath5 or @xmath6 , then any infinite collision sequence of @xmath5s and @xmath6s can be realized by choosing an appropriate initial condition .    in order to prove the theorem",
    ", we consider the coin system as a point billiard .",
    "on the configuration space of the coin , the coin reduces to a mass point moving in a domain with a scattering boundary ( figure 3b ) .",
    "then we show that a smale horseshoe @xcite is embedded in the billiard map @xmath7 .",
    "once we have a horseshoe , we will use the fact that the horseshoe map creates one - to - one correspondence between an infinitely long symbolic sequence to a phase point to complete the proof .",
    "one way to verify that a certain map contains a horseshoe is by showing that the map satisfies the conley - moser conditions @xcite , which are a combination of geometric and analytic criteria . if met , these conditions confirm that the stable manifolds and the unstable manifolds of the invariant set transversally intersect , which directly implies the existence of a horseshoe . in section 4 ,",
    "we use the coin billiard map @xmath7 to construct the horizontal and vertical strips satisfying the conley - moser conditions .",
    "although there are many naturally occuring systems in science and engineering that are proven to contain a horseshoe @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , all the studied horseshoe maps are defined on one connected domain . for our coin system ,",
