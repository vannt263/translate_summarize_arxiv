    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have emerged as the most practical and immediate path for improving our understanding of dark energy .",
    "techniques have been perfected for locating and studying hundreds of events over the redshift range 0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath11.5 where dark energy manifests itself , and ambitious new facilities are being planned that will take this progress to the next level of precision .",
    "however , it remains the case that the use of sne ia as cosmological probes is purely empirical , exploiting relationships between photometric properties such as peak luminosity , color and light curve width , that result in distance estimates precise to @xmath4 .",
    "early work by @xcite demonstrated that some of these photometric properties depend on their host galaxy type , with sne ia in spirals possessing wider light curves ( higher `` stretch '' ) and are more luminous than those in older elliptical hosts .",
    "this has subsequently been categorized in terms of ( perhaps distinct ) populations of ` prompt ' and ` delayed ' sne ia , whose properties appear to be governed by the star formation activity of the host galaxy and therefore age of the progenitor stellar population @xcite . with star formation increasing at higher",
    "redshift , these demographic variations produce a shift to more luminous , wider light curve events with redshift @xcite . @xcite",
    "discuss the implications and possible biases introduced in dark energy studies .",
    "a less well - understood variation is the scatter in the rest - frame sn ia ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra from one event to another . although model predictions differ in detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the form of the uv spectrum short - ward of 4000  is believed to be sensitive to progenitor composition and explosion physics .",
    "given the difficulty of studying this wavelength range in nearby events , the most comprehensive studies have been accomplished using uv data redshifted into the visible at @xmath50.5 @xcite .",
    "* hereafter e08 ) found significant scatter in the uv continuum below @xmath64000 , at a level which exceeds that predicted assuming quite significant metallicity variations in the current models .",
    "as both sn ia progenitor age and metallicity likely evolve with redshift , it is natural to ask whether any spectral variations likewise appear redshift - dependent .",
    "recent work by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f08 ) has tentatively identified a decrease with redshift , at @xmath32-@xmath7 significance , in the strength of blend of lines ( , , ) near 4800  in maximum - light sn ia spectra , which they attribute to 5129 . in this letter",
    ", we examine the rest - frame @xmath8@xmath94500  spectrum of sne ia over 0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath11.3 by combining data gathered using keck at @xmath2@xmath60.5 and hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) at @xmath2@xmath101 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r07 ) .",
    "following @xcite , our goal is to investigate whether any spectral variations are present that represent an evolutionary trend , and whether these can be explained by the observed shift to more luminous events at higher redshifts .",
    "we compile spectra from three sources corresponding to high , intermediate and low redshift ( @xmath2 ) . the intermediate-@xmath2 spectra",
    "are described in together with all aspects of their reduction .",
    "targets were drawn exclusively from the supernova legacy survey , forming a homogeneous sample representative of the snls parent sample .",
    "host galaxy contamination is removed using photometry of the hosts , with the flux calibration corrected using contemporaneous imaging of the sn light curves .",
    "this galaxy subtraction is a critical step when examining ground - based spectra of high - redshift sne , and an incorrect continuum subtraction can systematically affect line feature strengths and bias conclusions drawn from them ; the wide wavelength range of snls data allow an accurate host removal on individual spectra .",
    "we degrade the spectra to a resolution of 20  in the rest - frame to match that of the high-@xmath2 _ hst _ spectra discussed below ( the typical width of sn ia spectral features is @xmath11 , or @xmath12 resolution elements ) .",
    "the @xmath2@xmath100.9 spectra are taken from the _ hst _ acs grism campaigns of @xcite and .",
    "host galaxy subtraction is less problematic as the sne were resolved from their host due to the superior resolution of _",
    "any host that may lie underneath the sn is subtracted by defining narrow `` sky '' regions above and below the sn trace and interpolating to derive the contamination .",
    "the resolution of the grism ( @xmath13 at 8000 ) equates to @xmath14  in the rest - frame at 4000  for a @xmath2=1 sn , improving for higher-@xmath2 events .",
    "we rebin all spectra to the 20wavelength scale .    at low-@xmath2 , samples are heterogeneous in nature . both the and samples were found with `` rolling searches '' and can be considered complete with regard to host galaxy and environment ; the same is not true for local searches which frequently involve targeting known galaxies .",
    "we replace the sample used in with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m08 ) , which has the benefit of a homogeneous reduction technique , resulting in spectra that are close to spectrophotomteric ( m08 ) .",
    "for each sn we select the closest spectrum to a phase of + 3d ( the mean of the higher-@xmath2 samples ) . due to the large apparent size of the host galaxies ,",
    "the surface brightness at the sn position is small .",
    "the m08 spectra are optical only , so at @xmath8@xmath93600 , we supplement the sample with the space - based uv spectra of sn1992a @xcite , sn1981b @xcite and sn2001ba ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the only three spectroscopically normal sne ia in the appropriate phase range .",
    "the light curves of all the sne ia are fit using the sifto light curve fitter @xcite to place their photometric parameters on the same system .",
    "the distributions in light curve phase ( @xmath15 ; measured in days relative to maximum light in the rest - frame @xmath16 band divided by light curve stretch ) , @xmath2 , stretch ( @xmath17 ) and rest - frame @xmath18 color ( @xmath19 ) , are shown in figure  [ fig : tzs_hist ] .",
    "the high-@xmath2 _ hst _ spectra are typically at a later phase due to the scheduling and search strategy used . note that the snls , a rolling search , produces more early sn ia spectra than more traditional search methods used at low-@xmath2 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to a comparison sample of spectra with -1@xmath1@xmath15@xmath18 ( important given the evolution in sn spectra with light curve phase ) , a stretch range of 0.8@xmath1@xmath17@xmath11.30 , and a color range of -0.2@xmath1@xmath20@xmath10.35 .",
    "we only consider `` spectroscopically normal '' sne , excluding obvious , low - si sn1991t - like events @xcite .",
    "the mean properties are given in table  [ tab : sampleprops ] .",

    "the @xmath19  distributions of all three samples are consistent , arguing _ against _ the stretch differences arising primarily from selection effects related to search biases , as these would also be manifest in the color histograms .",
    "the sample of low-@xmath2 sne with uv spectra has a particularly low mean stretch , with two of these sne at the lower end of the stretch range ( sn1992a at 0.82 and sn1981b at 0.89 ) .",
    "we construct mean spectra for the three samples following .",
    "all spectra are corrected for milky way extinction and color - corrected using the salt-2 color law , reducing , though not eliminating , dispersion among sn ia spectra and aligning them in the mean .",
    "the spectra are normalized to have the same flux through a box filter defined from rest - frame 3750 to 4100  ( denoted @xmath22 ) , chosen as a common wavelength region for all spectra ( changing this wavelength range does not change our results ) .",
    "the error on the mean spectrum is estimated using a bootstrap resampling technique .",
    "previously presented a mean spectrum for the high-@xmath2 _ hst _ spectra ( used in comparisons with lower - redshift by ) , calculated over a wider phase range with different error estimation techniques , and lacking color - corrections on the individual spectra .",
    "a comparison of this mean with ( e.g. ) the intermediate-@xmath2 mean of would not be appropriate , so we rederive the _ hst _ mean for comparison on a consistent basis .",
    "the comparison of the mean spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : mean_spectrum ] . as noted by previous authors conducting similar analyses ,",
    "the spectra appear very similar .",
    "in particular , with the exception of the low-@xmath2 uv mean spectrum , the agreement in the shape of the continua is remarkable , suggesting the color corrections made to the spectra based on their optical color are effective in aligning the spectra across the entire wavelength and @xmath2 range .",
    "however , we find new evidence for variations in some ion feature strengths , most obviously around 4000  at the position of the blueshifted 4128  feature . since the luminosity of the sn ia is controlled by the amount of @xmath23ni synthesized in the explosion , for a chandrasekhar - mass explosion , brighter explosions imply increased @xmath23ni production at the expense of intermediate mass elements ( imes)fe or @xmath24ni play a role , but they are relatively constant from sn to sn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have only a small effect on this argument . ] such as si , ca and mg .",
    "so to first order one would expect to see fewer imes in more luminous , or broader - lightcurve sne .",
    "indeed , the 4128 feature has been shown to have a lower equivalent width in broader - lightcurve sne ia and , by extension , in sne ia originating in spiral galaxies . given",
    "the observed drift in mean stretch with @xmath2 of the sn ia population @xcite , arising from shifting demographics of the sn ia population , a generic prediction of two - component prompt+delayed sn ia rate models is that the amount of imes in general , and si in particular , in the average high-@xmath2 spectrum should be smaller @xcite .",
    "this is in the same sense as the trends observed in the comparison of the means in figure  [ fig : mean_spectrum ] .",
    "the interpretation of sn ia spectra is complicated , and this simple picture may not tell the whole story . observing a spectral feature in absorption only constrains the amount of material in a given ionization state , along the line of sight , above the photosphere at the time of the spectrum . at maximum light ,",
    "approximately 2/3 of the mass of the sn ia remains hidden under the photosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one can imagine a pathological situation in which more luminous sne ia have fewer imes above the photosphere , and more below , but this would be at odds with the basic physical principle that fusion in denser regions produces heavier elements , a generic property of sn ia models . instead , a more likely complication is that more luminous sne are hotter , and thus more ionized . in this situation , in the hottest regions",
    "may be ionized to , resulting in lower equivalent widths ( ews ) . fortunately",
    ", this potential complication does not change the basic principle that lower ews of singly ionized imes are expected in the spectra of more luminous sne ia .",
    ", comparing @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=0.20.8 mean spectra , find a lower strength in the blend at 4800  in higher-@xmath2 spectra .",
    "state they are unable to distinguish evolving sn ia demographics with evolution in the sn properties . at first sight",
    ", their trend appears consistent with the results of this paper : higher - stretch sne ia will be hotter , and thus fe ionized to at the expense of . however , the 4800  feature is a complex one , a blend of ( 5041 , 5055 ) , ( 4923 , 5018 , 5169 ) and ( 5129 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , attribute the weakening strength of the red side of the feature to which would be inconsistent with the simple picture outlined above . given the presence of the other and lines in this 4800  feature , further detailed modeling work is required before a robust conclusion with regards to this feature",
    "can be reached .",
    "we investigate the variations in more detail by measuring the strength of three accessible ime spectral features ( the blend of at rest - frame @xmath33950  and at @xmath33860 , at 4128 , and at 4481 ) .",
    "we fit a gaussian on a linear pseudo - continuum background and calculate the ( pseudo ) ew .",
    "the error is estimated by performing the ew fit on each of the bootstrap resampled spectra and taking the standard deviation of the resulting distribution . the variation with redshift of these features",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : features_z ] ; the trends are for a decreasing ew for all three ions with increasing redshift .",
    "we emphasize that these measurements are made on mean spectra ; in many cases the individual high-@xmath2 spectra show evidence of .",
    "further into the uv , the continuum level shows a redshift - dependent trend , with the spectra broadly consistent from 0.5@xmath1@xmath2@xmath11 , but depressed at @xmath2@xmath10.05 .",
    "potentially this is an important result ; however the different sn ia samples possess different mean stretches , and the uv - optical color of the higher - stretch samples may be expected to appear bluer .",
    "furthermore the paucity of local data and the intrinsic uv scatter from one event to another may explain such discrepancies .",
    "we quantify this `` evolution '' by measuring a uv - optical color on the mean spectra with two synthetic filters denoted @xmath25 ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath22 , both marked in figure  [ fig : mean_spectrum ] .",
    "errors are again estimated by analyzing the bootstrapped spectra , and the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : features_z ] .",
    "a key question is whether the changes seen in figures  [ fig : mean_spectrum ] and [ fig : features_z ] are a signature of evolution in individual sn ia properties , or instead a product of changing demographics in the sn population , i.e. the relative increase in sne ia from younger progenitors at higher redshift .",
    "are the spectral properties of sne ia , at a fixed stretch , evolving with redshift , or is the previously observed redshift drift in the mean stretch causing the observed spectral evolution ? to address this , we predict how the various spectral features might be expected to evolve with redshift were a demographic change solely responsible .",
    "we use the analysis of @xcite , which predicts how the fraction of the two sn ia components ( e.g. , ` a+b ' , delayed+prompt , or old+young ) , and hence the mean sn ia stretch , changes with redshift .",
    "this work is based on the galaxy - type dependent stretch distributions of @xcite coupled with a cosmic star formation history and various simple two - component sn ia rate models @xcite .",
    "we construct a mean spectrum for low and high - stretch sne ia based on the sample of , defining low - stretch ( @xmath26 ) and high - stretch ( @xmath27 ) sub groups .",
    "we use a split point of @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giving @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the low - stretch mean is assigned to the `` a '' ( delayed ) component , and the high - stretch mean to the `` b '' ( prompt ) component . a model mean spectrum for any redshift",
    "can then be constructed by combining the two stretch - dependent means in the appropriate ratio of the two components .",
    "predictions for the behavior of the various spectral features can be made by measuring these features on mean spectra constructed at different redshifts , and are over - plotted on figure  [ fig : features_z ] ( there is some circularity here , as the sample of spectra are also used to make the intermediate-@xmath2 measurement ; however here we are interested in the predicted _ change _ with redshift rather than the absolute values ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the predictions to the stretch split point is explored varying @xmath31 by 5% ; this has a very minor effect on the results .",
    "the predicted tracks of the model generally match the observations , although the uncertainties remain large . the decrease in ew with redshift",
    "is reproduced , though there is evidence that the high-@xmath2 mean shows an additional deficit in both si and ca compared to the lower - redshift spectra .",
    "this could also reflect an increase in the fraction of sn1991t - like events , believed to arise from a younger population , in the @xmath2@xmath101 sample , where excluding these objects is more difficult due to the lower signal - to - noise of the spectra .",
    "the predicted change in uv - optical color fails to match the data , though the robust datasets show only modest changes consistent with that implied by the change in mean stretch .",
    "the main discrepancy occurs with the local data .",
    "such a discontinuous behavior seems unlikely and probably arises from the incomplete sample of local uv spectra , re - emphasizing the need for local , spectroscopically - normal , sne ia observed in the uv .",
    "we have shown , for the first time , that the strength of some sn ia intermediate - mass element spectral features evolve systematically with redshift .",
    "however , we hypothesize that this evolution is related to the previously identified shift in sn ia photometric properties with redshift @xcite , and we show it can be partially modeled using a simple two - component sn ia rate model and the stretch dependent spectra of . after accounting for these expected trends , some small discrepancies in the highest redshift spectra",
    "remain , though none at high significance .",
    "thus , we conclude that the observed evolution in sn ia spectral features can be explained by , and is consistent with , changes in sn ia demographics , rather than evolution in the properties of individual , photometrically - similar sne .",
    "controlling for these demographic shifts is the challenge for sn ia precision cosmology experiments , for example by ensuring that an appropriate @xmath32-correction template is used as a function of redshift , and confirming that the empirical relationships used to calibrate sne ia in cosmological applications are valid across all environments .",
