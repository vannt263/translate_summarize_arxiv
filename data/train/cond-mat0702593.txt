    "manganites like la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2  or la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  obtained a lot of interest in the last decades , especially after the discovery of the resistivity s dependence on the magnetic field , the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) .",
    "the detection of huge changes of the resistance in the 90 s led to an acceleration of the research in this topic .",
    "experimentalists found very rich phase diagrams containing para- and ferromagnetic insulating and metallic regions as well as different kinds of antiferromagnetism , which can be accompanied by an ordering of charge or of orbitals .",
    "most of these phases can also be identified in theoretical calculations . but even after that long time of research there are still many unresolved issues .",
    "the origin of the cmr is determined as a competition of different phases , but the exact connections are unknown .",
    "a large variety of phases is an evidence of the complexity of those systems .",
    "thus it is important to create a solvable model , which contains as many as possible effects that can appear in manganites .",
    "+ the electronic and magnetic features are mainly due to the @xmath3-electrons of the mn@xmath4 and the mn@xmath5 ions , whose ratio is defined by the doping rate @xmath6 . both kinds of ions have fully occupied spin - up @xmath7-levels which provide a localized spin of @xmath8 , but only the mn@xmath4 ions also have an itinerant @xmath9-electron .",
    "the main features of this system should be covered by the kondo lattice model ( klm ) or double exchange model .",
    "but already ten years ago it became clear that this model needs to be extended to describe manganites in a proper way .",
    "first of all millis et al . argued that the jahn - teller effect ( jte ) , which can split up the @xmath9-orbitals , should be important at low and intermediate doping range @xcite .",
    "likewise it is stated in some recent publications that a direct antiferromagnetic coupling between the localized spins , caused by a superexchange via the oxygen orbitals , is necessary to describe the competition between the different magnetic phases . besides the necessity for the different phases , it also seems to be important to increase the cmr in theoretical calculations @xcite to be in better accordance with the measured data .",
    "in this article we want to describe the manganites in the whole ferromagnetic regime",
    ". therefore we use a two - band klm with finite hund coupling .",
    "we extend this model by terms , which describe the jte , the superexchange and the coulomb interaction . in that general model most of the physics of the manganites",
    "should be incorporated .",
    "the phonons of the jt modes are treated classically , but the spins quantum mechanically .",
    "the model is solved approximately , but self - consistently .",
    "these extensions will appear essential to get the correct doping dependence of the curie temperature and to achieve metal - insulator transitions simultaneously with the breakdown of the ferromagnetic order .",
    "therefore we study the hamiltonian : @xmath10 @xmath11 is the annihilator ( creator ) of an electron with spin @xmath12 in the orbital @xmath13 corresponding to the d@xmath14 or d@xmath15 orbital at site @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the hund coupling between the itinerant spin @xmath19 and the localized @xmath20 .",
    "the hubbard parameter can represent the fact that there is only intraband coulomb repulsion ( i.e. @xmath21 ) or that there also is an extra interband interaction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 corresponds to the direct superexchange .",
    "@xmath24 are special jt modes which couple with the pseudospin operators @xmath25 , e.g. @xmath26 . a similar model is used e.g. in ref .",
    "possible other effects , like a hybridization between the @xmath9-bands , will not be considered explicitly .",
    "we will have a short discussion about that in the appendix [ app_v ] .",
    "to solve the resulting equations we need some simplifications .",
    "the jt part is treated in a mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "assuming translational invariance , introducing spherical coordinates @xmath27 and using `` dressed '' operators @xmath28 , which are now corresponding to the higher and lower jt orbital , yields @xmath29 here is @xmath30 and @xmath31 as one can see @xmath32 is dependent on the occupation numbers @xmath33 and therefore has to be calculated self - consistently .",
    "the dressed operators are @xmath34 and are now a superposition of the original @xmath9-states .",
    "we simplify the notation by setting @xmath35 .",
    "the formulation of @xmath36 in ( [ hjt ] ) is possible because of the restriction to non - cooperative effects . of course , the jt - distortions are cooperative in reality , which is e.g. important for orbital ordering .",
    "but we restrict on the non - cooperative distortions , so that we can solve the resulting equations .",
    "this suitable form of @xmath36 allows us to combine it easily with the kinetic part @xmath37 containing the dispersion @xmath38 of the free band for simple cubic structure . in this form of @xmath36",
    "one can easily see that the jte can split up the bands for @xmath39 ( band jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "that is why we will now refer to both bands as jt bands , which are denoted by the index @xmath13 .",
    "if we first leave out the antiferromagnetic coupling , we remain with a correlated klm , @xmath40 the related green s function can be approximated within an interpolating self - energy approach ( isa ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "we get a self - energy , which fulfills practically all limiting cases of the klm . the exactly solvable cases of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor ( magnetic polaron ) and the atomic limit are reproducible by the isa . also a second order perturbation theory is included .",
    "these cases are interpolated by the use of rigorous high - energy expansion . if we postulate that this approximation is valid also between the limiting cases , we get a theory that should be reliable for all temperatures , band occupations and couplings @xmath18 .",
    "+ within the isa , the hubbard term was handled in an effective medium approach , so it influences the spectral weight and the width of the bands .",
    "but of course it will also give an additional splitting of the bands into different hubbard sub - bands .",
    "we will call all bands ( distinguished by the indices @xmath41 coming from the jte and the spin ) which are not affected by the coulomb repulsion lower hubbard bands and the other ones upper hubbard ( sub-)bands . the lower and",
    "the upper sub - bands have an energy difference of the magnitude of the hubbard parameter @xmath42 . for manganites",
    "the value of the coulomb repulsion is much greater than all the other parameters so we can choose in a good approximation @xmath43 .",
    "this means the upper hubbard bands will be shifted to infinite energy and will therefore never be occupied .",
    "thus we do not have to consider these bands explicitly .",
    "we get the one particle green s function @xmath44    ( color online ) differences of the qdos at ferromagnetic saturation ( @xmath45 ) if one only has intraband coulomb interactions or additional interband repulsions .",
    "the main discrepancies are at higher occupation number @xmath46 .",
    "especially a complete filling of the bands is only possible with extra interband repulsion ( mott - hubbard - insulator ) .",
    "the upper hubbard bands are shifted to infinity . @xmath47    it is @xmath48 the spectral weight of each band coming from the hubbard term , @xmath49 the self - energy in the isa formalism and @xmath50 the centers of gravity . + here the @xmath51 represent the probability that there is _ no _ repulsion partner for an electron on the same site .",
    "thus the sum of the @xmath51 , which is equivalent to the maximum occupation of the lower hubbard bands , for the _ _ intra__band repulsion is greater than for _ _ inter__band interaction . figure [ dos_mou ] shows the influence of the @xmath51 on the quasi - particle density of state ( qdos ) . as can be seen a complete filling of the lower hubbard bands for @xmath52",
    "is only possible with the adding of interband repulsion .",
    "this complete filling correlates with the generation of a mott - hubbard - insulator .",
    "thus this property of the manganites for @xmath53 is automatically fulfilled within the isa including an extra interband repulsion .",
    "+ the explicit structure of the self - energy is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with the spectral theorem we can calculate important terms like the correlation functions @xmath57\\text{im}g_{{\\mathord{\\mathbf k}}\\sigma\\alpha}(e-\\mu)\\label{d_isa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mean occupation values @xmath58 and the occupation difference @xmath59 self - consistently .",
    "the only remaining model parameters are the spin @xmath60 , @xmath18 , the jt coupling @xmath61 , the bandwidth @xmath62 , the total density @xmath63 ( corresponding to @xmath64 ) and the magnetization @xmath65 .",
    "+ there are some important changes in the qdos of the isa compared to e.g. mean - field calculations .",
    "the often used neglection of minority spins by setting @xmath66 contradicts for example the klm s exactly solvable atomic limit . even for large @xmath18",
    "there is a spectral weight of the spin - down peaks of the qdos , so that a large hund s coupling alone can not prevent double occupation .",
    "thus we get a finite qdos of the spin - down electrons at lower energies ( fig .",
    "[ dos_mou ] ) .",
    "this originates from scattering processes of the spin - down electrons .",
    "those can do a spin - flip while emitting a magnon and so become a spin - up electron .",
    "this can only be done at an energy interval with a finite number of spin - up states , due to the low magnon energies .",
    "that means we have a finite occupation number of minority spin electrons even for a large hund s coupling .",
    "furthermore there is a peak in the spin - up spectrum at higher energies which is connected to a magnetic polaron .",
    "details can be found in the original paper@xcite .",
    "to calculate @xmath65 in a self - consistent way , too , we use another technique . in the modified rkky formalism ( mrkky )",
    "we try to map the hamiltonian of the klm onto an effective heisenberg model @xcite . that is done by averaging out the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this yields @xmath67 @xmath68 means averaging while treating the spins as numbers .",
    "we can now construct the equation of motion ( eom ) for the green s function @xmath69 .",
    "this yields @xmath70 as a simplest approximation we can replace the full green s functions r.h.s . by free green s functions , @xmath71 then we use the spectral theorem and @xmath72 to get effective exchange parameters @xmath73 for an effective heisenberg model @xmath74 this is the result of the conventional rkky ( crkky ) which is originally derived by perturbation theory for low @xmath18 .",
    "but we can go one step further and replace the upper green s functions by the green s function we derived in ( [ gf ] ) .",
    "@xmath75 after the solution of the eom , we get effective exchange integrals @xmath76 which define the effective heisenberg term .",
    "these exchange integrals now contain the electronic correlations due to @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the green s function ( [ gf ] ) .",
    "we have now included the band index @xmath13 which we first left out for simplicity .",
    "the mrkky covers the crkky for low @xmath18 ( @xmath79 ) and the double exchange for large couplings ( @xmath80)(fig .",

    "@xmath88 comes from the electronic properties and is a long range interaction ( @xmath89 5th-30th neighbor ) and @xmath87 is constant and short range ( next neighbor ) .",
    "thus the adding of @xmath87 is more than just a renormalization of the energy scale .",
    "we can now directly calculate the magnetization @xmath65 with the solution by callen @xcite : @xmath90 furthermore one can derive equation ( [ tc ] ) for the direct calculation of the curie temperature as it is shown in the appendix .",

    "@xmath93    we will focus on the model s electronic and magnetic properties , like the resistivity , the jt - splitting and the curie temperature .",
    "as we will see there is a great difference between having only intraband repulsion or having additional interband correlations .",
    "interesting , for example , is the influence of the jt - splitting on the curie temperature ( fig .",

    "we need a critical @xmath92 , which was also found in other works@xcite , to split up the bands .",
    "this splitting will usually decrease @xmath81 , but with extra interband repulsion and larger occupation number @xmath46 ( @xmath94 , which means half - filling in this case ) @xmath81 can also be increased .",
    "thus we will observe the respective interaction in different parts .",
    "+ experimental results show that the ferromagnetic regime is in the doping rate @xmath95 with a maximum of @xmath81 at @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the observed behavior of the curie temperature is not reproducible in the pure two - band klm , because it causes a finite @xmath81 for high and low doping rates .",
    "therefore it is necessary to include other effects . in our case",
    "these are the jte and the superexchange , incorporated by a direct antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore at higher electron densities a cmr is observed accompanied by a fm to pi transition . to achieve a large cmr and to reproduce the insulating behavior for @xmath52 we will need interband coulomb repulsion .",
    "+ several suggestions were made to explain the cmr .",
    "most are based on a competition between different phases ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite this is described as a result of the competing tendencies to form a charge localized or a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this leads to a peak of the resistivity at @xmath81 .",
    "a further theory is based on the current - carrier density collapse induced by the emerging of bipolarons@xcite .",
    "those bipolarons can be broken up below @xmath81 for a exchange @xmath97 which is large enough .",
    "we will see in our model that this peak of the resistivity at @xmath81 can be the consequence of a lattice distortion ( intraband coulomb repulsion ) or of a drastic change of the spectral weight of the quasi - particle density of states ( interband coulomb repulsion ) . + it is not in the scope of the paper to investigate antiferromagnetic phases or orbital ordering .",

    "the impact on @xmath81 of the jte appears at low and of the af coupling at high doping rates .",
    "this different scope of each coupling is physically consistent , because at high electron density ( that means small @xmath6 ) there are more active mn@xmath4 ions , so the jte should be supported , which is shown by measurements , too @xcite .",
    "a reduction of @xmath81 by the jte has also be found by other authors , e.g. ref.@xcite .",

    "the importance of @xmath23 in connection with the rkky - mechanism is even more obvious .",
    "no matter whether we use the crkky or the mrkky formalism , there is always a finite curie temperature for small electron densities , i.e. high @xmath6 , for @xmath104 ( compare ref.@xcite and fig .",

    "calculations without such an extension can achieve good results for @xmath81 at lower doping rates , but they will miss the characteristical decrease above @xmath105 . + we can now try to calculate realistic values of @xmath81 .",

    "since la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2  is regarded to have a larger bandwidth , we use @xmath108 .",

    "this is indeed the case , as it is widely known from the experiments showing antiferromagnetic or spin glass phases , which we are not treating in this work . that our approximative self - energy @xmath134 actually leads to antiferromagnetism at @xmath132",
    "was shown by hennig@xcite .",
    "+ furthermore we can get a high cmr effect ( fig . [ cmr1 ] ) which was very much smaller while using only intraband repulsion . in this case",
    "the origin of the resistivity jump is different from that which occurred in the intraband calculations .",
    "the latter originated from the jte and the increasing band splitting .",
    "now , in the interband calculations , it comes from a drastic change of the dos in the bands themselves .",
    "figure [ dos_c ] shows that at @xmath81 it comes to a large rearranging of the dos at the fermi energy if no external magnetic field is applied .",
    "this leads to a drastic reduction of the spin - up dos which can not be compensated by the increase of the spin - down dos .",
    "therefore the resistivity is jumping to a higher value . at higher temperatures above @xmath81",
    "there is an increase of the conductivity due to the softening of the fermi function .",
    "the fast changing of the dos can be slowed down in the presence of an external magnetic field and leads to a delay of the increase of @xmath129 .",
    "that means we have a cmr effect .",
    "+ quantitatively , the resistivity should vary over more orders of magnitude , according to the experiment .",
    "we also have to pay for the better agreement of the resistivity with a worse behavior of @xmath81 .",
    "the curie temperature is much more suppressed if we use interband repulsion and we can not get the typical shape of a parabola for the @xmath81-@xmath46-curves . such a strong influence on @xmath81 is probably due to the effective medium treatment of the hubbard part .",
    "this treatment can not contain all many - body correlation effects .",
    "thus for the calculation of @xmath81 we should include the coulomb interaction in a more subtle way , which is no simple task , of course .",

    "_ left : _ ( @xmath139 ) the qdos at the fermi energy is changing very drastically at @xmath81 .",
    "it develops a lack of spin - up electrons which can not be compensated by the spin - down electrons and creates the jump of the resistivity in fig .",
    "after @xmath81 the qdos is not changing very much and @xmath129 lowers because of the softening of the fermi edge .",
    "_ right : _ ( @xmath140 ) the qdos is not changing very much at all .",

    "we investigated manganite systems with a two - band klm , which was extended by terms that represent the coulomb correlations , the jte and the superexchange . within this model we calculated the electronic and magnetic properties self - consistently by the use of an interpolating self - energy approach and a modified rkky method .",
    "because of the use of full single - particle green s functions , this method contains more many - body interactions than the conventional rkky .",
    "therefore it gives reliable results even for larger @xmath18 .",
    "+ with this formalism it was possible to calculate curie temperatures , which are in very good agreement to experimental measurements in the total ferromagnetic doping range , if we use intraband coulomb repulsion . we have shown that therefore the additional terms to the klm are essential to achieve these results .",
    "we found a phase diagram with fm - pi transitions where a cmr effect occurs and the jt distortion behaves qualitatively like in the measurements .",
    "but we have seen in our model that the neglection of interband hubbard correlations will lead to an incorrect behavior of the resistivity . with the introduction of such interactions we get qualitatively correct results .",
    "a disadvantage of our effective medium treatment of the hubbard part is , that it has a too strong influence on the magnetic properties , especially @xmath81 .",
    "possibly , a treatment of the hubbard term that has a better inclusion of many - body correlations could correct these discrepancies .",
    "+ most of the research on manganites is done with the simplification @xmath141 , which means effectively the neglection of the minority spins . but as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ dos ] , there exists also for @xmath131 a finite occupation of the spin - down band .",
    "this comes from scattering processes of the spin - down with the spin - up electrons accompanied by magnon emission or absorption , which is a result of the quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "thus the influence of the spin - down electrons can not be neglected , just by the assumption of infinite hund s coupling .",
    "+ in principle our model contains all ingredients to describe the para-/ferromagnetic phase of the manganites properly and none of the parts seems to be negligible .",
