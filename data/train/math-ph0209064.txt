    "in this paper we consider a system of weakly nonlinear equations with a small positive parameter @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a column vector , @xmath3 is an @xmath4 matrix , and @xmath5 is a column vector .",
    "we assume that all coefficients are sufficiently smooth functions .",
    "many physical problems are described by such systems .",
    "we mention only some examples : dispersive waves in plasma , problems of weakly nonlinear optics , one - dimensional gas dynamic equations , shallow water waves .",
    "the construction of uniform asymptotic approximations of the solution of ( [ math/1 ] ) becomes a nontrivial task if secular terms arise in the expansion .",
    "we can illustrate this situation by considering the following linear problem @xmath6 we find easily the exact solution of problem ( [ i1 ] ) @xmath7 using a taylor series expansion of the function @xmath8 we get that @xmath9 this expansion has secular terms @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and therefore the formula ( [ i2 ] ) is asymptotical only if @xmath13 . in this case",
    "we have that @xmath14    for @xmath15 this expansion is not asymptotical . on the other hand the problem ( [ i1 ] ) has a classical solution in any domain @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath18 therefore it is a nontrivial task to construct an asymptotical approximation , which is uniformly valid in the region @xmath19 .",
    "the basic idea of all asymptotic methods is to introduce new `` slow '' variables , e.g. , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and to define explicitly the dependence on `` fast '' variables .",
    "for example in @xcite the solution is obtained in the following form : @xmath22 substituting these expressions into system ( [ math/1 ] ) , using a taylor expansion with respect to @xmath0 , and equating coefficients at @xmath23 we get equations for new unknown functions @xmath24 @xmath25    our goal is to approximate the initial nonlinear problem by some fundamental equations , for which the analytical solution exists . the burgers equation and the korteweg - de vries equations are examples of such problems .",
    "most asymptotical methods are based on physical assumptions and no strict mathematical proofs of the validity of these approximations are given @xcite .",
    "important applications of asymptotic methods are given in @xcite .",
    "a survey of mathematical results on asymptotic expansion methods is presented by kalyakin in @xcite , see also keworkian and cole @xcite .",
    "similar problems arise not only for systems of equations , but also for semilinear perturbed wave equations , the telegraph equation and weakly nonlinear beam equation @xcite .",
    "usually application of formal asymptotic method reduces the initial problem to a single nonlinear wave equation @xcite .",
    "our method reduces problem ( [ math/1 ] ) to the integro - differential system of averaged equations .",
    "a new problem can be seen as a more difficult problem , than the initial formulation .",
    "however , we will show that the averaged system disintegrates into independent equations in the non - resonance case .",
    "moreover , our method allows to describe accurately the resonance interaction of waves , as well .",
    "our internal averaging method is close to the multiple - scale method , which is used for similar problems in @xcite .",
    "the application of internal averaging method for solving gas dynamic equations is presented in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec/1 ]",
    ", we formulate the general averaging scheme .",
    "we propose the averaging operators and compare our scheme with the other similar methods . in section  [ sec/2 ] , we consider the resonance case , when the averaged system is connected . section  [ sec/3 ] deals with the application of the proposed algorithm for a shallow water model .",
    "it is proved that the initial system is ill - posed , hence the regularized model is formulated .",
    "the averaged system also gives a nontrivial regularization of the shallow water model .",
    "finally we give the results of numerical experiments .",

    "if it is satisfied , then averaged system ( [ math/9 ] ) disintegrates into independent equations , which are similar to ( [ math/13 ] ) .",
    "it was proved in @xcite , that the class of functions @xmath61 , for which the _ internal _ averaging can be applied , includes almost periodic functions .",
    "for example , let assume that @xmath90 then system ( [ math/7 ] ) is non - resonance if @xmath91    thus our method treats uniformly both the resonance and non - resonance problems .",
    "the mathematical justification of the method was given only in the case , when the operator  @xmath58 in system ( [ math/1 ] ) does not depend on @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "but our results for non - resonance systems coincide with the results given by some other methods .",
    "therefore we expect that asymptotic solution approximates uniformly the exact solution in more general cases too .",
    "the numerical analysis of such problems will be given in the next section .",
    "in this section we consider the system of shallow water equations @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the water surface level , @xmath94 is the horizontal velocity of the fluid , @xmath95 is the normalized bottom equation .",

    "we will prove that in the non - resonance case system ( [ math/21 ] ) describes two independent waves .",
    "let assume , that ( [ math/11 ] ) holds for the initial condition , then we get @xmath118 system ( [ math/20 ] ) is non - resonance if the following equalities @xmath119 hold .",
    "then averaged system ( [ math/21 ] ) reduces to two korteweg - de vries equations : @xmath120    let consider the following initial conditions : @xmath121 we also assume that @xmath122 then the non - resonance condition can be written as @xmath123 in the periodic case , when the periods of functions @xmath124 and @xmath125 are equal to @xmath126 , we have that @xmath127 .",
