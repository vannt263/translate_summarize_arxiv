    "the nature of tev scale new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is a question of enormous interest as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is poised to collect data in this energy range .",
    "clearly , supersymmetry ( especially the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) ) is one of the prime candidates for this new physics since it not only solves the gauge hierarchy problem , but also has a number of attractive features such as the unification of gauge couplings at a high scale , a potential dark matter candidate , etc .. an interesting question along these lines has always been to see if any other new physics can co - exist with tev scale supersymmetry without conflicting with coupling unification and dark matter , thereby broadening the scope of lhc physics search .",
    "a particularly appealing possibility is that weak interactions conserve parity asymptotically  @xcite with the associated gauge group being @xmath1 so that the resulting gauge bosons @xmath2 and @xmath3 are at the tev scale co - existing with supersymmetry .",
    "the case for @xmath1 becomes more compelling when the sm or mssm are extended to understand small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism  @xcite . as a generic possibility",
    ", this scenario is quite consistent with current low energy observations .",
    "whether a tev scale @xmath6 symmetry is compatible with supersymmetric coupling unification has been extensively investigated in literature  @xcite . with a few exceptions",
    "@xcite , it seems very hard to reconcile this possibility with the observed value of @xmath7 . in a recent paper  @xcite , we pointed out a new supersymmetric @xmath0 scenario where the presence of a vector like electroweak singlet and color triplet higgs multiplet ( which is part of the * 45 * representation in @xmath0 ) in addition to two bidoublets and two right handed doublets of the left - right electroweak group at the tev scale leads to gauge coupling unification with tev scale right handed @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons .",
    "this model is different from other such scenarios considered in the literature  @xcite in that quark masses and mixing arise in a simple manner .",
    "the neutrino masses arise out of an inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite and was shown  @xcite to have interesting phenomenological consequences like leptonic non - unitarity , leptonic @xmath8-violation , lepton flavor violation , etc . which may be testable in near future .",
    "this fit to the fermion masses defines one class of @xmath0 models with tev scale @xmath2 which we call model ( a ) .    in this paper ,",
    "several new results for these @xmath0 models are presented : ( i ) we present an alternative fit to fermion masses , which we call model ( b ) ; ( ii ) we discuss the constraints of proton decay for both fermion mass fits  the one in ref .",
    "@xcite and the new one discussed in this paper ; ( iii ) we also show how both @xmath9 and electroweak symmetries can be broken radiatively in these models",
    ".    strength of proton decay has been studied extensively in the context of many supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "although there is no evidence for proton decay till now , current experimental lower bounds on the partial lifetimes of various proton decay modes tend to put severe constraints on these models e.g. they have now ruled out the simplest versions of susy @xmath10 and suggest possible modifications of such models  @xcite .",
    "they also constrain the choices of higgs multiplets that can be used for model building with @xmath0 group  @xcite .    in the models we are discussing here , due to the fact that all the yukawa couplings responsible for proton decay are constrained by the fermion mass fits , it is possible to estimate the partial life times for the various modes as functions of the squark masses and for reasonable squark masses of the first two generations , and for model ( a ) , we get upper bounds on various proton decay channels . there are no such bounds in the second case ( model ( b ) ) .",
    "we find that within a reasonable set of assumptions , all our predicted upper bounds for model ( a ) are consistent with the current experimental bounds and some of the modes may be accessible to the next generation proton decay experiments with megaton size detectors .",
    "we also discuss the constraints imposed by radiative breaking of both @xmath5 and the sm gauge symmetries via radiative corrections . the idea is to start with soft mass squares at the planck or gut scale and extrapolate the masses to the weak scale to see if the @xmath5 symmetry breaks at the tev scale .",
    "we then note that this breaking introduces via @xmath11-terms a breaking of the sm gauge symmetry to @xmath12 .",
    "we also discuss the generalization of this model to include @xmath13-parity breaking and its implications on proton decay .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iii , we review the fermion mass fit for model ( a ) already discussed in ref .  @xcite . in sec .",

    "v describes the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) in this type of models . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss the proton decay in both these models . in sec .",
    "vii , we comment on the effect of @xmath13-parity breaking terms in the superpotential on proton decay .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "viii . in appendix",
    "a , we present the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for soft susy - breaking masses in our supersymmetric left - right ( susylr ) model . in appendix b , we derive the anomalous dimensions of the dimension-5 proton decay operators in our model . in appendix c",
    ", we list the hadronic form factors used in our proton decay calculations .",
    "as in the usual @xmath0 models , the three generations of quark and lepton fields are assigned to three * 16 * dim .",
    "spinor representations .",
    "in addition , we add three @xmath0 singlet matter fields to implement the inverse seesaw mechanism . the @xmath9 gauge symmetry is broken at the tev scale by * 16 * -higgs fields ( denoted by @xmath14 ) , whereas the rest of the gauge symmetry is broken at @xmath15 gev by * 54 * and * 45 * - fields ( denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively ) .",
    "we require two * 45 * -higgs fields ( @xmath18 ) , one for symmetry breaking and the other to give rise to the vector - like color triplets at the tev scale .",
    "the sm symmetry is broken by two * 10 * -higgs fields ( denoted by @xmath19 ) .",
    "we note that the field content of our model is found in many string models after compactification e.g. fermionic compactification models  @xcite and it may therefore be easier to embed this gut model into strings .",
    "the distinguishing feature of our model is that the gut symmetry breaks down to the left - right symmetric gauge group @xmath20 without parity ( @xmath11-parity ) .",
    "the @xmath11-parity is broken at the gut scale by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the * 45 * -higgs field .",
    "a consequence of @xmath11-parity breaking is that only the right - handed ( rh ) doublets from * 16 * -higgs fields survive below the gut scale",
    ". an interesting feature of this class of models  @xcite is that if we have two rh higgs fields [ @xmath21 , two bi - doublet fields [ @xmath22 ( all color singlets ) and a vector - like color triplet but @xmath23 singlet field [ @xmath24+c.c . ] at the tev scale , the gauge couplings unify around @xmath25 gev .",
    "the bidoublet fields arise from * 10 * -higgs at the gut scale and the vector - like color triplet fields arise from the * 45 * -higgs field .",
    "this is therefore a new class of @xmath0 susy - gut theories with tev scale @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons which can be accessible at the lhc .",
    "we consider the symmetry breaking chain @xmath26 where , as an example of our notation , @xmath27 means @xmath28 .",
    "as shown in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite , for consistency , we need at least two @xmath29 and one @xmath30 representations of the higgs fields to break the @xmath0 gauge group into the susylr gauge group , @xmath31 , at the scale @xmath32 gev . note that to have realistic fermion masses and mixing , we need at least two @xmath33 bi - doublets of the @xmath34 higgs representation to break the @xmath35 gauge group of the sm to @xmath36 at the weak scale @xmath37 . with this minimal set of higgs fields , we were able to attain not only gauge coupling unification but also the desired fermion masses and mixing at the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "incidentally , since our gauge group above tev scale is different from mssm , we needed to extrapolate fermion masses using the left - right group ( see appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which has certain distinguishing features in the running behavior , in contrast to the mssm gauge group .",
    "the superpotential for the model consists of several parts : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is responsible for @xmath0 gut symmetry breaking , doublet triplet splitting and the remnant sub - gut scale multiplets ; @xmath40 is the yukawa superpotential responsible for fermion masses and mixing ; @xmath41 involves the @xmath13-parity violating terms .",
    "when we impose an additional matter parity symmetry under which @xmath42 , and all other fields even , as was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we get @xmath43 , i.e. all @xmath13-parity violating terms are absent in the superpotential and the model has a stable dark matter  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the effects of nonzero @xmath41 in a subsequent section where we show that even after including arbitrary @xmath13-parity violating terms ( i.e. giving up matter parity assumption ) , the model does satisfy proton life time bounds since @xmath41 conserves baryon number and after @xmath9 breaking leads to a highly suppressed amplitude for proton decay .",
    "this feature is characteristic only of @xmath0 models with low @xmath9 breaking .",
    "the yukawa superpotential is given by @xmath44 where the first term is the usual yukawa coupling term , while the second term is a higher - dimensional term whose completely antisymmetric combination acts as an effective @xmath45 operator , thus giving rise to a realistic fermion mass spectrum at the gut scale .",
    "we define this as our model ( a ) .",
    "the superpotential @xmath39 was discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was noted that the following components of the @xmath30 and @xmath29 higgs fields acquire vev and leave the left - right subgroup unbroken : @xmath46",
    "the model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite is defined by the vev pattern of the bi - doublets : @xmath47 we define the ratio of the vevs as @xmath48 as in mssm .",
    "then the fermion mass matrices at the gut - scale are given by @xmath49 where in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath50 .",
    "the contribution from the effective @xmath51 operator is assumed to be the same for both up and down sectors , i.e. @xmath52 ; as a result , we have the relation @xmath53 .",
    "also note that the factor @xmath54 between the quark and lepton sector is due to the same @xmath55 operator . using the renormalization group analysis for the fermion masses and mixing in the susylr model ( see appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we obtain the gut - scale fermion masses starting from the experimentally known values at the weak scale .",
    "using these mass values , we obtain a fit for the coupling matrices at the gut scale defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) . here",
    "we give the results in a down quark mass diagonal basis for two cases : + ( a ) @xmath56 : in this case , the gut - scale values of the charged fermion masses are found to be @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that the gut - scale fermion masses quoted here are slightly different from those given in ref .",
    "@xcite because , in this case , we have set the @xmath59 coupling @xmath60 ( of ref .",
    "@xcite ) assuming @xmath13-parity conservation . with these mass eigenvalues",
    ", we find a fit for the gut - scale couplings of the form : @xmath61 note that for simplicity we have chosen the @xmath62-couplings to be diagonal .",
    "our fit does not allow the off - diagonal components to be too different from zero .",
    "+   + ( b ) @xmath63 : in this case , the gut - scale values of the charged fermion masses are found to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 . with these mass eigenvalues , we obtain a fit for the couplings of the following form : @xmath66 we note that in this model , larger values of @xmath67 are not allowed . this can be seen analytically from the form of the rges given in appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite where it is clear that the up - quark sector masses will increase rapidly at high energies for large @xmath68 and the same effect is induced in the down - quark sector which makes the yukawa terms dominant over the gauge terms .",
    "this makes all the quark masses to run up to unacceptably large values at the gut - scale .",
    "we believe this is a general feature of low - scale susylr models , in contrast to mssm case  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider an alternative mass fit within the @xmath0 models with low scale @xmath9 .",
    "it follows from a recent ansatz  @xcite that in generic @xmath0 models which do not use type i seesaw to fit neutrino masses , an alternative fit to fermion masses is possible using the idea  @xcite that one has a rank one * 10 * -higgs yukawa coupling matrix which dominates the fermion masses while other couplings introduce small corrections ; the third generation masses arise from the dominant rank one coupling matrix with smaller * 126 * and second * 10 * couplings generating the ckm mixing as well as the second and the first generation fermion masses .",
    "this idea can be applied to our case since , the neutrino mass is given by the inverse seesaw formula which involves an additional matrix @xmath69 .",
    "the main difference of model ( b ) as compared to model ( a ) resides in the vev pattern of the two higgs bidoublets i.e. in model ( b ) , we have @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "also we must have @xmath72 in order to get right fermion mixing pattern . in the limit @xmath73 , the rg analysis of model ( a )",
    "can be applied to this case to generate fermion masses at the gut scale as well as the symmetry breaking pattern via radiative corrections .",
    "the resulting fermion mass formulae in terms of the appropriately redefined yukawa couplings are given as follows  @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 as in the case of model ( a ) , the @xmath62 coupling above represents the effective * 126 * coupling arising from the @xmath76 term in the superpotential and @xmath77 arises from a coupling of the form @xmath78 ( with a nonzero vev for the additional singlet field @xmath79 ) .",
    "note that if there is an additional @xmath80 symmetry under which @xmath81 are odd and all other fields are even , one can have a superpotential with only the @xmath82 type contributions as given above , to the fermion mass formulae . in our case with two higgs bi - doublets , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . with the gut - scale mass eigenvalues obtained earlier ,",
    "we obtain a fit for these couplings as follows : + ( a ) @xmath85 : @xmath86 ( b ) @xmath63 : @xmath87 and @xmath77 same as in case ( a ) .",
    "it may be noted here that in both the cases , all the fermion mass values predicted using the couplings above agree with those obtained from the rges within the experimental uncertainty , the only exception being the up - quark mass in case ( a ) , where the our predicted value is about 4 times larger .",
    "note however that in our discussion , we have not included contributions from threshold corrections or higher dimensional operators .",
    "those contributions can generally be of order mevs when their couplings are chosen appropriately , in which case , they will not affect the second and third generation masses but could easily bring the up quark mass into agreement with rge predictions .    with the yukawa couplings completely fixed in our model",
    ", we can analyze the predictions for the proton decay rate .",
    "but before doing so , we discuss the details of the electroweak symmetry breaking in this model which was not done in the original paper  @xcite .",
    "this discussion applies to both models ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in this section , we propose a way to break both the @xmath88 as well as the sm symmetry via radiative corrections from renormalization group extrapolation of the scalar higgs masses from the gut to tev scale .",
    "as is well known , the large top quark coupling enables us to achieve a similar goal i.e. radiative ewsb in the case of mssm  @xcite .",
    "the simple generalization of that procedure can not work in our model since the bidoublet higgs of lr models contains both the @xmath89 components of mssm , and as a result , large top quark coupling will necessarily turn both their masses negative and this is known not to give a stable vacuum .",
    "our proposal is that we use a domain of parameter space for the soft susy - breaking mass squares for the rh higgs doublets @xmath90 and @xmath91 where the mass square of one of them turns negative , by rg running to the tev scale due to the @xmath92 yukawa coupling being large .",
    "this leads to a breaking of the @xmath6 and @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "the mass square of the @xmath90 remains positive throughout but it acquires an induced vev .",
    "the differences in their vevs , via the @xmath11-term , can make the mass square of the @xmath93 field negative while keeping the mass square of @xmath94 positive as in the case of mssm , thereby also giving rise to the ewsb .",
    "the main point is that both symmetry breakings owe their origin to one radiative correction .    in order to show that it is indeed possible to achieve negative mass square for one of the rh higgs doublets",
    "while keeping all other soft mass squares positive , we need to examine the rg running of all the soft mass parameters from the gut to tev scale . in this regime ,",

    "note that there are only three mixing parameters as there are only four color triplet higgses in the mssm gauge group , corresponding to the two @xmath156 fields in our model .",
    "as we are interested only in the upper bound for the partial lifetimes of various proton decay channels , we do not need to know the detailed form for the @xmath161 parameters in terms of these masses and mixings .",
    "we just vary these parameters numerically to get the maximum value for the partial lifetimes .",
    "it can be shown that  @xcite in the limit of all squark masses being degenerate as in typical msugra type models , the gluino and bino contributions to the dressing of the dimension-5 operators vanish .",
    "this basically follows from the use of fierz identity for the chiral two component spinors representing quarks and leptons . in realistic models ,",
    "the fcnc constraints allow only very small deviations from universality of squark masses .",
    "hence , these gluino and bino contributions are expected to be small compared to the wino contributions , and can be ignored altogether .",
    "the charged wino dressing diagrams have been evaluated earlier  @xcite , and in the limit of degenerate squark masses , this leads to the effective lagrangian  @xcite @xmath165 ,      \\label{eq : lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath166 denotes the charge - conjugation matrix and @xmath167 is given by @xmath168 @xmath169 being the wino mass and @xmath170 the sfermion mass . using this expression and adding a similar contribution from the neutral wino exchange diagram , we can write down the total contribution to various proton decay channels .",
    "this is summarized in table [ tab : coeff ] .",
    "we note that the proton decay operators with @xmath171-quark lead to @xmath172-meson final states whereas the ones without @xmath171 lead to @xmath173 final states .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : coeff ] , the amplitude for non - strange quark final states will be cabibbo - suppressed compared to the strange quark final states .",
    "it is also important to mention here that the total amplitude for final states involving neutrinos is the incoherent sum of the rates for all three neutrino states .",
    "this leads to large decay rates for @xmath174 and @xmath175 channels compared to the other decay channels due to the large yukawa couplings of the third generation .",
