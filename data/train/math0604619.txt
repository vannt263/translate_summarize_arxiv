    "a wavelet is a special case of a vector in a separable hilbert space that generates a basis under the action of a collection , or `` system '' , of unitary operators defined in terms of translation and dilation operations .",
    "this approach to wavelet theory goes back , in particular , to earlier work of goodman , lee and tang [ 10 ] in the context of multiresolution analysis .",
    "we will begin by describing the operator - interpolation approach to wavelet theory using the local commutant of a system that was worked out by the speaker and his collaborators a few years ago .",
    "this is really an abstract application of the theory of operator algebras , mainly von neumann algebras , to wavelet theory .",
    "the concrete applications of operator - interpolation to wavelet theory include results obtained using specially constructed families of wavelet sets .",
    "in fact x. dai and the speaker had originally developed our theory of wavelet sets [ 5 ] specifically to take advantage of their natural and elegant relationships with these wavelet unitary systems .",
    "we will also discuss some new results and open questions .",
    "the main idea in _ operator - theoretic interpolation _ of wavelets ( and frames ) is that new wavelets can be obtained as linear combinations of known ones using _ coefficients _ which are _ operators _ ( in fact , _ fourier multipliers _ ) in a certain class .",
    "both the ideas and the essential computations extend naturally to more general unitary systems and _ wandering vectors_. many of the methods work for more involved systems that are important to applied harmonic analysis , such as gabor and generalized gabor systems , and various types of _ frame _ unitary systems .",
    "the set of all bounded linear operators on a hilbert space @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "a _ bilateral shift _",
    "@xmath3 on @xmath1 is a unitary operator @xmath3 for which there exists a closed linear subspace @xmath4 with the property that the family of subspaces @xmath5 are orthogonal and give a direct - sum decomposition of @xmath1 .",
    "the subspace @xmath6 is called a _",
    "complete wandering subspace _ for @xmath3 , and the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath3 is defined to be the dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "the _ strong operator topology _ on @xmath7 is the topology of pointwise convergence , and the _ weak operator topology _ is the weakest topology such that the vector functionals @xmath8 on @xmath2 defined by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , are all continuous .",
    "an _ algebra of operators _ is a linear subspace of @xmath2 which is closed under multiplication .",
    "an _ operator algebra _ is an algebra of operators which is _ norm - closed_. a subset @xmath12 is called _ selfadjoint _ if whenever @xmath13 then also @xmath14 .",
    "a @xmath15-_algebra _ is a self - adjoint operator algebra .",
    "a _ von neumann algebra _ is a @xmath15-algebra which is closed in the weak operator topology . for a unital operator algebra , it is well known that being closed in the weak operator topology is equivalent to being closed in the closed in the strong operator topology .",
    "the _ commutant _ of a set @xmath16 of operators in @xmath2 is the family of all operators in @xmath2 that _ commute _ with every operator in @xmath16 .",
    "it is closed under addition and multiplication , so is an algebra . and",
    "it is clearly closed in both the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology .",
    "we use the standard _ prime _",
    "notation for the commutant .",
    "so the commutant of a subset @xmath17 is denoted :   @xmath18 .",
    "the commutant of a selfadjoint set of operators is clearly a von neumann algebra .",
    "moreover , by a famous theorem of fuglede every operator which commutes with a normal operator @xmath19 also commutes with its adjoint @xmath20 , and hence the commutant of any set of _ normal _ operators is also a von neumann algebra .",
    "so , of particular relevance to this work , the commutant of any set of _ unitary _ operators is a von neumann algebra .",
    "a sequence of vectors @xmath21 in a separable hilbert space @xmath22 is a _ frame _ ( or _ frame sequence _ ) if there exist constants @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 the frame is called _ tight _ , and if @xmath27 , @xmath21 is called a _ _ p__arseval frame .",
    "( the term _ normalized tight _ has also been used for this ( cf [ 14 ] ) .",
    "a vector @xmath28 is called a _ _ f__rame vector for a unitary system @xmath29 if the set of vectors @xmath30 is a frame for @xmath1 .",
    "a riesz basis for a hilbert space is a bounded unconditional basis .",
    "frames sequences are generalizations of riesz bases .",
    "a number of the basic aspects of a geometric , or operator - theoretic , approach to discrete frame theory on hilbert space arises from the fact that a frame sequence is simply an `` inner '' direct summand of a riesz basis .",
    "the basic principle is that a hilbert space frame sequence can be dilated to a riesz basis for larger hilbert space .",
    "we call this the _ frame dilation theorem_. in other words , for a given frame sequence there is a larger hilbert space and a riesz basis for the larger space such that the orthogonal projection from the larger space onto the smaller space compresses the riesz basis to the frame sequence .",
    "we proved this at the beginning of [ 14 ] , and used it to prove the other results [ 14 ] , and subsequently to prove some applications to hilbert c*-module theory jointly with m. frank .",
    "we proved it first for parseval frames , and then for general frames .",
    "( we remark that this type of dilation result for frames was also independently known and used independently by several others in different contexts . )",
    "it is interesting to note that the parseval frame case of the frame dilation theorem can be derived easily from the purely atomic case of a well known theorem of naimark on projection valued measures .",
    "we thank chandler davis for pointing this out to us at the canadian operator algebras symposium in 1999 .",
    "we ( han and i ) basically proved this special case of naimark s theorem implicitely in the first section of [ 14 ] without recognizing it was a special case of naimark s theorem , and then we proved the appropriate generalization we needed for general ( non - tight ) frames .",
    "naimark s dilation theorem basically states that a suitable positive operator valued measure on a hilbert space _",
    "dilates _ to a projection valued measure on a larger hilbert space .",
    "that is , there is a projection valued measure [ pvm ] on a larger hilbert space such that the orthogonal projection from the larger space unto the smaller space compresses the [ pvm ] to the [ povm ] . in the discrete ( i.e. purely atomic measure )",
    "case , it can be interpreted as stating that a suitable sequence of positive operators dilates to a sequence of projections . the dilation theorem for a parseval frame follows easily from naimark s theorem applied to the [ povm ] obtained by replacing each vector @xmath31 in the frame sequence with the elementary tensor operator @xmath32 , obtaining the atoms for a [ povm ] defined on all subsets of the index set for the frame . the dilation theorem for a general ( non - tight ) frame does not seem to follow directly from naimark s theorem  but it may follow from a generalization of it . we remark that some other generalizations of the frame dilation theorem have been recently worked out , notably by w. czaja .",
    "we define a _ unitary system _ to be simply a countable collection of unitary operators @xmath33 acting on a hilbert space @xmath1 which contains the identity operator .",
    "the _ interesting _ unitary systems all have additional structural properties of various types .",
    "( for instance , wavelet systems and gabor systems are both `` ordered products '' of two abelian groups : the dilation and translation groups in the wavelet case , and the modulation and translation groups in the gabor case . )",
    "we will say that a vector @xmath34 is _ wandering _ for @xmath33 if the set @xmath35 is an orthonormal set , and we will call @xmath36 a _",
    "complete wandering vector _ for @xmath33 if @xmath37 spans @xmath1 .",
    "this ( abstract ) point of view can be useful .",
    "write @xmath38 for the set of complete wandering vectors for @xmath33 . further ,",
    "riesz vector _ for @xmath33 is a vector @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is a riesz basis for @xmath1 ( indexed by the elements of @xmath33 ) , and a _ frame vector _ is a vector @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is a frame sequence for @xmath1 ( again using @xmath33 as its index set ) , and we adopt similar terminology for parseval frame vectors and bessel vectors .",
    "we use @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 to denote , respectively , the sets of riesz vectors , frame vectors , parseval frame vectors , and bessel vectors for @xmath33",
    ".    one of the main tools in this work is the _ local commutant _ of a system of unitary operators ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "this is a natural generalization of the commutant of the system , and like the commutant it is a linear space of operators which is closed in the weak and the strong operator topologies , but unlike the commutant it is usually not selfadjoint , and is usually not closed under multiplication .",
    "it contains the commutant of the system , but can be much larger than the commutant .",
    "the local commutant of a wavelet unitary system captures all the information about the wavelet system in an essential way , and this gives the _ flavor _ of our approach to the subject .",
    "if @xmath3 is a unitary operator and @xmath43 is an operator algebra , then @xmath3 is said to _ normalize _",
    "@xmath43 if  @xmath44  . in the most interesting cases of operator - theoretic interpolation : that is , for those cases that yield the strongest structural results , the relevant unitaries in the local commutant of the system normalize the commutant of the system .",
    "this article was written in response to an invitation by the organizers of the 4th international conference on wavelet analysis and its applications , macau , china , december 2005 [ waa2005 ] to be a keynote speaker .",
    "we thank the organizers for their kind invitation to present these notes .",
    "for simplicity of presentation , much of the work in this article will deal with one - dimensional wavelets , and in particular , the dyadic case .",
    "the other cases : non - dyadic wavelets and wavelets in higher dimensions , are at least notationally more complicated",
    ".      a _ dyadic orthonormal _ wavelet in one dimension is a unit vector @xmath45 , with @xmath46 lebesgue measure , with the property that the set @xmath47 of all integral translates of @xmath36 followed by dilations by arbitrary integral powers of @xmath48 , is an orthonormal basis for @xmath49 .",
    "the term _ dyadic _ refers to the dilation factor `` @xmath48 '' .",
    "the term _ mother wavelet _ is also used in the literature for @xmath36 .",
    "then the functions @xmath50 are called elements of the wavelet basis generated by the `` mother '' . the functions",
    "@xmath51 will not themselves be mother wavelets unless @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be the translation ( by @xmath55 ) and dilation ( by @xmath48 ) unitary operators in @xmath56 given by @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ". then @xmath59 for all @xmath60",
    ". operator - theoretically , the operators @xmath61 are _ bilateral shifts _ of _ infinite multiplicity_. it is obvious that @xmath62)$ ] , considered as a subspace of @xmath63 , is a complete wandering subspace for @xmath53 , and that @xmath64 \\cup [ 1 , 2])$ ] is a complete wandering subspace for @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath65 be the unitary system defined by @xmath66 where @xmath54 and @xmath53 are the operators defined above .",
    "then @xmath36 is a dyadic orthonormal wavelet if and only if @xmath36 is a complete wandering vector for the unitary system @xmath65 .",
    "this was our original motivation for developing the abstract unitary system theory .",
    "write @xmath67 to denote the set of all dyadic orthonormal wavelets in one dimension .",
    "an abstract interpretation is that , since @xmath54 is a bilateral shift it has ( many ) complete wandering subspaces , and a wavelet for the system is a vector @xmath36 whose translation space ( that is , the closed linear span of @xmath68 is a complete wandering subspace for @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath36 must generate an orthonormal basis for the entire hilbert space under the action of the unitary system .    in one dimension ,",
    "there are non - dyadic orthonormal wavelets : i.e. wavelets for all possible dilation factors besides @xmath48 ( the dyadic case ) .",
    "we said `` possible '' , because the scales @xmath69 are excluded as scales because the dilation operators they would introduce are not bilateral shifts .",
    "all other real numbers for scales yield wavelet theories .",
    "in [ 5 , example 4.5 ( x ) ] a family of examples is given of three - interval wavelet sets ( and hence wavelets ) for all scales @xmath70 , and it was noted there that such a family also exists for dilation factors @xmath71 . there is some recent ( yet unpublished ) work that has been done , by reu students and mentors , building on this , classifying finite - interval wavelet sets for all possible real ( positive and negative scale factors ) .",
    "i will mention this work , in passing , in my talk .",
    "let @xmath72 , and let @xmath73 be an @xmath74 real matrix which is _ expansive _ ( equivalently , all ( complex ) eigenvalues have modulus @xmath75 ) . by a _",
    "dilation - @xmath73 regular - translation orthonormal wavelet _ we mean a function @xmath76 such that @xmath77 where @xmath78 , is an orthonormal basis for @xmath79 .",
    "( here @xmath80 is product lebesgue measure , and the superscript `` t '' means transpose . )    if @xmath81 is invertible ( so in particular if @xmath73 is expansive ) , then it is very easy to verify that the operator defined by @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , is _",
    "unitary_. for @xmath85 , let @xmath86 be the unitary operator determined by translation by @xmath55 in the @xmath87 coordinate direction .",
    "the set ( 5 ) above is then @xmath88    if the dilation matrix @xmath73 is expansive , but the translations are along some oblique lattice , then there is an invertible real @xmath89 matrix @xmath53 such that conjugation with @xmath90 takes the entire wavelet system to a regular - translation expansive - dilation matrix .",
    "this is easily worked out , and was shown in detail in [ 18 ] in the context of working out a complete theory of unitary equivalence of wavelet systems . hence the wavelet theories are equivalent .",
    "much work has been accomplished concerning the existence of wavelets for dilation matrices @xmath73 which are not expansive .",
    "some of the original work was accomplished in the ph.d .",
    "theses of q. gu and d. speegle , when they were together finishing up at texas a&m .",
    "some significant additional work was accomplished by speegle and also by others . in",
    "[ 18 ] , with ionascu and pearcy we proved that if an @xmath91 real invertible matrix @xmath73 is not similar ( in the nxn complex matrices ) to a unitary matrix , then the corresponding dilation operator @xmath92 is in fact a bilateral shift of infinite multiplicity .",
    "if a dilation matrix were to admit any type of wavelet ( or frame - wavelet ) theory , then it is well - known that a necessary condition would be that the corresponding dilation operator would have to be a bilateral shift of infinite multiplicity .",
    "i am happy to report that in very recent work [ 23 ] , with e. schulz , d. speegle , and k. taylor , we have succeeded in showing that this minimal condition is in fact sufficient : such a matrix , with regular translation lattice , admits a ( perhaps infinite ) tuple of functions , which collectively generates a frame - wavelet under the action of this unitary system .",
    "we note that _ most _ unitary systems @xmath93 do not have complete wandering vectors . for @xmath94 to be nonempty , the set @xmath93 must be very special .",
    "it must be _ countable _ if it acts separably ( i.e. on a separable hilbert space ) , and it must be _ discrete _ in the strong operator topology because if @xmath95 and if @xmath96 is a wandering vector for @xmath93 then @xmath97 certain other properties are forced on @xmath93 by the presence of a wandering vector .",
    "( or indeed , by the nontriviality of any of the sets @xmath94 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 . )",
    "one purpose of [ 5 ] was to investigate such properties .",
    "indeed , it was a matter of some surprise to us to discover that such a theory is viable even in some considerable generality . for perspective , it is useful to note that while @xmath65 has complete wandering vectors , the reversed system @xmath102 _ fails _ to have a complete wandering vector .",
    "( a proof of this was given in the introduction to [ 5 ] . )",
    "computational aspects of operator theory can be introduced into the wavelet framework in an elementary way .",
    "here is the way we originally did it : fix a wavelet @xmath36 and consider the set of all operators @xmath103 which _ commute _ with the _ action _ of dilation and translation on @xmath36 .",
    "that is , require @xmath104 or equivalently @xmath105 for all @xmath106 .",
    "call this the _ local commutant of the wavelet system @xmath65 at the vector @xmath36_. ( in our first preliminary writings and talks we called it the _ point commutant _ of the system . ) formally , the local commutant of the dyadic wavelet system on @xmath63 is : @xmath107 this is a linear subspace of @xmath2 which is closed in the strong operator topology , and in the weak operator topology , and it clearly contains the _ commutant _ of @xmath108 .",
    "a motivating example is that if @xmath109 is any other wavelet , let @xmath110 be the unitary ( we call it the _ interpolation unitary _ ) that takes the basis @xmath51 to the basis @xmath111 . that is , @xmath112 for all @xmath106 .",

    ", we will use the same notation @xmath117 for the unitary that takes the vector @xmath118 to @xmath119 for all @xmath120 .",
    "this simple - minded idea is reversible , so for every unitary @xmath121 in @xmath122 the vector @xmath123 is a wavelet .",
    "this correspondence between unitaries in @xmath124 and dyadic orthonormal wavelets is one - to - one and onto ( see proposition  3.1 ) .",
    "this turns out to be useful , because it leads to some new formulas relating to decomposition and factorization results for wavelets , making use of the _ linear _ and _ multiplicative _ properties of @xmath124 .",
    "it turns out ( a proof is required ) that the entire local commutant of the system @xmath65 at a wavelet @xmath36 is _ not _ closed under multiplication , but it also turns out ( also via a proof ) that for _ most _ ( and perhaps _ all _ ) wavelets @xmath36 the local commutant at @xmath36 contains many noncommutative operator algebras ( in fact von neumann algebras ) as subsets , and their unitary groups _ parameterize _",
    "norm - arcwise - connected families of wavelets .",

    "this type of question is interesting from a pure mathematical point of view , speaking as an operator theorist , and it just may have some practical consequences depending on the nature and the degree of depth of solutions .",
    "* problem 1 : * [ connectedness ] this was the first global problem in wavelets that we considered from an operator - theoretic point of view . in [ 5 ]",
    "we posed a number of open problems in the context of the memoir .",
    "the first problem we discussed was problem a ( in [ 5 ] ) which conjectured that @xmath558 is norm - arcwise - connected .",
    "it turned out that this conjecture was also formulated independently by guido weiss and his group ( see [ 9 ] , [ 17 , [ 26 ] ) from a harmonic analysis point of view ( our point of view was purely functional analysis ) , and this problem ( and related problems ) was the primary stimulation for the creation of the wutam consortium  a team of 14 researchers based at washington university and texas a&m university .",
    "( see [ 26 ] , for the first publication of this group . )",
    "this _ connectedness conjecture _ was answered yes in [ 26 ] for the special case of the family of dyadic orthonormal mra wavelets in @xmath63 , but still remains open for the family of _ arbitrary _ dyadic orthonormal wavelets in @xmath63 , as well as for the family of orthonormal wavelets for any fixed @xmath306 and any dilation matrix in @xmath325 .",
    "a natural related problem which also remains open , is whether the set of riesz wavelets is connected .",
    "an intermediate problem , which is also open , asks whether given two orthonormal wavelets is there a continuous path connecting them consisting of riesz wavelets ?",
    "( some evidence for a positive answer to this problem is given by proposition 6.1 below , which easily shows that every point on the convex path connecting two wavelets ( i.e. @xmath559)is a riesz wavelet _ except _ for perhaps the midpoint corresponding to @xmath560 .",
    "thus this problem has an easy positive solution for many pairs of orthonormal wavelets , but no way has been found to get around the midpoint obstruction to show that all pairs are connected , perhaps by some exotic type of path . )",

    "these are tantalizing , but the main problems still remain open .",
    "all of these connectivity problems have counterparts for other unitary systems . for wavelet systems",
    ", they remain open ( to our knowledge ) for all dimensions @xmath306 and all expansive matrix dilation factors . and for other systems , in particular in [ 14 ] , we showed that for a fixed choice of modulation and translation parameters ( necessarily , of course , with product @xmath562 ) the set of weyl - heisenberg ( or gabor ) frames is connected in this sense , and also it is norm - dense in @xmath63 in the sense of problem 2 below .",
    "although the weil - heisenberg ( aka gabor ) unitary systems are of a simpler operator - theoretic structure than the wavelet systems , and this permits the use of some techniques which do not work so well in the wavelet theory , even so this perhaps is another reason to think that general connectedness results are possible within the wavelet theory .",
    "* problem 2 : * [ density ] is the set @xmath563 of all riesz wavelets _ dense _ in the norm topology in the hilbert space @xmath63 ?",
    "this was posed as a conjecture by larson in a talk in august 1996 in a nato conference held in samos , greece .",
    "it was posed in the same spirit as the connectivity problem above , in the sense that it asks about the topological nature of @xmath563 as a subset of the metric space @xmath63 . like the connectivity problem",
    "it is a _ global _ type of problem .",
    "a positive answer might be useful for applications if it could be given a some type of _ quantitative interpretation_. a subproblem of this , which was discussed in several subsequent talks , is the same density problem but for the set of frame - wavelets @xmath561 .",

    "one of the reasons for thinking that this conjecture may be positive is the following result , which we think is the most _ elementary _ application of operator - theoretic interpolation .",
    "it is abstracted from chapter  1 of [ 5 ] , although the form in [ 5 ] is a bit different .",
    "let @xmath93 be a unitary system on a hilbert space @xmath1 .",

    "then @xmath577 since @xmath121 is unitary , @xmath578 is an invertible element of @xmath575 if @xmath579 , so the first conclusion follows from proposition  3.2 .",
    "now assume @xmath580 .",
    "let @xmath73 be the unique invertible element of @xmath575 such that @xmath581 , and write @xmath582 . since @xmath73 is bounded and invertible there are @xmath583 such that @xmath584 where @xmath585 denotes the spectrum of @xmath73 , and the same argument applies .",
    "the above proposition indicates that riesz wavelets are plentiful . as mentioned above , by writing @xmath586 , and using the fact that the local commutant is a linear space so contains @xmath587 , it follows that a convex combination of orthonormal wavelets is a riesz wavelet except possibly for the mid - point corresponding to @xmath560  .",
    "so , if @xmath36 and @xmath109 are orthonormal wavelets , the line in the vector space @xmath63 containing the pair @xmath210 is in the norm closure of the set of riesz wavelets .",
    "operator theoretic interpolation shows that more general linear combinations of finite families of riesz wavelets are very often riesz wavelets . and",
    "if one considers a finite family of wavelet sets @xmath588 , with union @xmath16 , then the restricted sets of riesz wavelets , or orthonormal wavelets , or parseval framelets , or framelets , which are restricted in the sense that they have their frequency support contained in @xmath16 , is always connected if the family of wavelet sets is an _ interpolation family _ , and these restricted sets of wavelets are very often connected even if the interpolation family criterion fails for @xmath588 .",
    "( in fact , it is a conjecture that these restricted sets of wavelets are _ always _ connected . )",
    "moreover , these restricted sets are _ dense _ in @xmath589 ( considered as a subspace of @xmath63 ) if the family @xmath588 is an interpolation family , and it is yet another conjecture that they are _ always _ dense in @xmath589 .",
    "it is also known ( see [ 5 ] for instance ) that the linear span @xmath389 is dense in @xmath63 .",
    "so these facts together suggest that it is probably true that the set of riesz wavelets @xmath563 is dense in @xmath63 .",
    "however , the problem remains open .",
    "also , as mentioned above under the _ connectivity _ problem , one can easily deduce some _ frame versions _ of proposition 6.1 using elementary spectral theory of operators which provides some quick - and - easy partial results on density of riesz wavelets and framelets .",
    "however , the general problem for riesz wavelets remains open .",
    "( for the density problem for framelets , we mention that marcin bownick has recently obtained a significant positive result !",
    "it appears that he has solved the problem positively for _ framelets_. but apparently it remains open for riesz wavelets . )    as with the connectedness problem , all of these problems have counterparts for other unitary systems . for wavelet systems , they remain open ( to our knowledge ) for all dimensions @xmath306 and all expansive matrix dilation factors ( except for the recent interesting framelet density result of bownick mentioned above ) . and for other systems , as mentioned in the context of problem 1 , in [ 14 ] we showed that for a fixed choice of modulation and translation parameters with product @xmath562 the set of weyl - heisenberg ( or gabor ) frames is dense in @xmath63 in this sense .",
    "this is another reason to think that general density results might be possible within the wavelet theory .",
    "* problem 3 : * [ frequency support ] ( see section 4.4 . ) [ must the support of the fourier transform of a wavelet contain a wavelet set ? ] this conjecture was posed about 10 years ago , by larson , and the problem still remains open for the case of dimension @xmath55 and dilation factor @xmath48 .",
    "it makes sense for any finite dimension @xmath306 and any matrix dilation , and it apparently remains unsolved in any case .",
    "it has been studied by several researchers , and z. rzeszotnik , in particular , has made some progress on the problem .",
    "a related problem , also posed by larson , ( see section 4.4 ) asks whether a wavelet which has minimal support in the frequency domain is necessarily an msf wavelet .",
