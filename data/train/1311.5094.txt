    "a set @xmath3 is called a metric space if for any pair of elements @xmath4 a distance function @xmath5 ( called a metric ) is defined and satisfies the following four axioms for any triplet of points @xmath6",
    ": @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 a metric @xmath11 satisfying the strong triangle inequality @xmath12 is called an ultrametric . a space with an ultrametric is called a space with an ultrametric structure or an ultrametric space .",
    "an arbitrary real valued matrix @xmath13 is called _ a metric matrix _ if its elements satisfy the conditions ( [ m_1])([m_4 ] ) , and it is called _ an ultrametric matrix _ if its elements satisfy the conditions ( [ m_1])([m_3 ] ) and ( [ um ] ) .",
    "classic examples of ultrametric spaces are the field @xmath14 of @xmath15-adic numbers @xcite , and the ring @xmath16 of @xmath17-adic numbers ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "ultrametric spaces had long been used in various fields of natural and social sciences to problems of classification and information processing : optimization theory , taxonomy , cluster and factor analysis , and other @xcite . during the last 30 years , the mathematical apparatus of ultrametric analysis was developed by by v.s.vladimirov and coworkers .",
    "this relatively new scientific field of ultrametric mathematical physics is represented by many books and works devoted to development of the @xmath15-adic analysis , @xmath15-adic mathematical physics and its application to modeling in various fields of physics , biology , computer science , psychology , sociology , and so on ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact a lot of physical , biological or socio - economic systems has intrinsic hierarchical structure @xcite .",
    "systems with non  explicit hierarchical structure are of considerable interest to researchers . in such systems the hierarchical structure can not be observed in the original variables , but it becomes observable after transition to some effective ( hidden ) variables .",
    "typically the number of these effective variables is essentially smaller than the number of degree of freedom of the whole system .",
    "there are reasons to believe that hidden ultrametric structures are present in a number of complex systems ( i.e. systems with a large number of heterogeneous interacting objects ) , which include spin glasses , proteins , nucleic acids , etc .",
    "similar ultrametric models arose in the early eighties last century in statistical physics of spin systems with a disorder @xcite . namely it was found that if the system has large number of internal contradictions ( frustrations ) at different scales , equilibrium of the system can be achieved in hierarchically nested regions of phase space , and number of nesting levels increases with decreasing a temperature . in this case",
    "there are relations between phase region scales , that satisfy the strong triangle inequality and thus low - temperature spin states are correlated ultrametrically .    almost immediately after the appearance of ultrametric spin glass models",
    "it has been assumed that the conformational state space of protein molecule has ultrametric structure @xcite . in this case states",
    "are associated with local minima of the potential energy landscape of a protein molecule , and the energy landscape is represented as a hierarchy of nested basins of free energy local minima .",
    "ultrametric models of conformational dynamics of protein molecules have been developed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "there is also some evidence that similar ultrametric structures arise in socio - economic systems @xcite .    in many cases",
    "the idea of application of ultrametric models to complex systems such as proteins came from the theory of spin glasses @xcite and there are many arguments in favor of that protein should have the ultrametric structure ( see @xcite for the discussion of energy landscapes and hierarchical disconnectivity graphs ) .",
    "however , the explanation of the origin of ultrametric structures in spin glasses based on the replica method , which is not quite rigorously justified .",
    "thus it is interesting to discuss alternative approaches to ultrametric structures in complex systems .    in this paper",
    "we propose a procedure of generation of ultrametric structure in a metric space . in this procedure",
    "we do not assume any ultrametric properties for the initial metric space .",
    "it has been observed in several studies ( see , for example , @xcite ) , that the effectiveness of clustering algorithms applied to large data sets significantly increases with increasing the dimension of the array .",
    "moreover it has been observed that the distance between randomly distributed points in multidimensional metric spaces shows ultrametric properties with increasing space dimension . in this paper",
    "we give the rigorous proof that any finite ultrametric space can be generated by a special random distribution of points in the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean metric space taking the limit @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the ultrametric is completely determined by variances of random point coordinates .",
    "we present the algorithm for generating such ultrametric spaces .",
    "the validity of the algorithm is numerically demonstrated by calculations of distance matrices and ultrametricity indexes for high dimension spaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the formulation of our construction .",
    "also in this section we formulate and prove the theorem that is the main result of this article . in section 3 , we describe the algorithm of a stochastic generation of ultrametrics in high - dimensional euclidean spaces and check the validity of its by numerical simulations .",
    "let us formulate statements which will be used in our construction .",
    "let @xmath18 be a finite ultrametric space with an ultrametric @xmath19 .",
    "we say that a space @xmath20 is _ an isometric space _ , and an ultrametric @xmath19 is _ an isometric _",
    "if for any triplet of points @xmath21 in @xmath20 the following condition holds : @xmath22 , i.e. distances between any two non  coinciding points are equal .",
