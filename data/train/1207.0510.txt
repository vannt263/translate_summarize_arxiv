    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has demonstrated astounding success in describing phenomena at energy scales below a few hundred gev . however , despite this success , there are significant questions which the sm does not address adequately .",
    "some of these , such as the hierarchy problem and the origin of flavor , arise as theoretical issues within the sm , while others , such as the tiny but nonzero value of the cosmological constant , the origin of neutrino masses , and the identity of dark matter ( dm ) , reflect discrepancies between observation and the sm prediction .",
    "all of these questions indicate that , despite the remarkable success of the sm , it is not a complete theory of nature .    given both the successes and the shortcomings of the sm",
    ", it makes sense to consider models of new physics which address one or more of the above questions while not radically altering the structure of the sm .",
    "following this philosophy , we investigate the possibility of adding new fermions , including a possible dm candidate , to the sm without altering its gauge group , @xmath2 .",
    "( for examples of works where exotic fermion multiplets have been added to the sm , see @xcite . ) while all fermions in the sm transform as singlets or as the fundamental representations under the @xmath3 color and the @xmath4 weak interactions , higher - dimensional representations are possible . here , we investigate the possibility of new fermions which transform as higher - dimensional multiplets under @xmath4 . we will , in fact , add more than one new multiplet to the sm , and we will refer to this set of multiplets as a `` polyplet '' .",
    "there are several advantages to adding higher - dimensional @xmath4 fermion multiplets to the sm .",
    "the first is that we can hope to arrange the quantum numbers of the multiplets such that they obtain their masses only via yukawa couplings with the sm higgs boson ; thus our model would contain no new mass scales and would predict all of its new particles to be near the electroweak scale .",
    "second , if the dimensionality of these new multiplets is large , with isospin greater than @xmath5 , it is impossible to write down dimension - four mass terms which mix these new fermions with those of the sm .",
    "in addition to simplifying the model , this implies that the lightest member of the polyplet can not decay to sm particles through renormalizable operators ; this is useful as we hope that our polyplet will contain a dm candidate . and introduce a new conserved quantum number to disallow the unwanted operators . ] for related works in which @xmath4 multiplets have been added to the sm in order to solve the dm puzzle , see @xcite .",
    "several considerations must be taken into account when introducing new @xmath4 multiplets to the sm .",
    "first , constraints on the existence of new neutral or charged massless particles from colliders @xcite and cosmology @xcite imply that all members of these new multiplets must be given masses .",
    "we choose the quantum numbers of these new multiplets such that all masses are acquired via yukawa couplings with the sm higgs ; we wish to avoid dimension-3 mass terms and we disallow mixing with the sm fermions .",
    "additionally , we wish to avoid the possibility of a charged stable particle ( see @xcite and references therein for constraints on charged relics ) , so we insist that the lightest new particle is electrically neutral .",
    "finally , as we are interested in possible dm candidates , we only consider colorless particles .    after giving masses to our new fermions ,",
    "we explore their phenomenology . because their transformations under the sm gauge group are specified , their interactions are largely predetermined , although some couplings are tunable via mass mixing .",
    "we consider present experimental bounds on these new higher - dimensional multiplets and find that they are allowed for a wide range of new particle masses .",
    "we also find , for large higgs boson masses , that our dm candidate can achieve the observed relic density via annihilation to gauge bosons and top quarks while simultaneously evading direct detection constraints ; for @xmath1 gev , our dm candidate can only comprise a subdominant but non - negligible ( @xmath6 ) component of the observed relic density .",
    "we organize the remainder of this paper as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we introduce our model , and discuss its particle content , couplings , and masses , and restrictions put on the model by requiring anomaly cancellation .",
    "we then consider constraints from searches at colliders and precision electroweak measurements in section [ sec : const ] .",
    "in section [ sec : dm ] , we investigate constraints placed by dm direct search experiments , and , finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we conclude .",
    "we begin this section by specifying our notation and discussing some basic considerations which must be taken into account in order to make all of the particles in our model massive .",
    "the polyplet we will consider contains four fermion multiplets , charged under @xmath0 , which we will denote as left - handed chiral spinors @xmath7 . here",
    "we label our multiplets with their number of components @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the multiplet isospin ) and hypercharge @xmath11 .    in order to evade the constraints on the existence of new massless particles",
    ", we must arrange masses for all of the particles in our model . at the same time",
    ", we wish for our model to be predictive ; therefore , we insist that all fermion mass terms be dimension-4 yukawa couplings to the ( hypercharge @xmath12 ) sm higgs doublet @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the multiplication needed to render the mass terms @xmath4-invariant and the value of @xmath16 has been determined in terms of @xmath11 by hypercharge conservation .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath17 where @xmath18 gev ; we thus expect the fermion masses to be tied to the electroweak scale .",
    "because the sm higgs field is an isospin doublet , two @xmath19 multiplets can couple to each other via a yukawa term only if their isospins differ by @xmath20 or , equivalently , if @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath19 multiplets with half - integer isospin ( or even @xmath8 ) will only be coupled to those with integer isospin ( or odd @xmath8 ) , and vice - versa .",
    "this implies that , in order for all particles in these multiplets to obtain masses , we must have an equal number of particles in even-@xmath8 multiplets and in odd-@xmath8 multiplets .",
    "let us consider the possible yukawa couplings of a multiplet @xmath22 with @xmath23 components .",
    "let us assume it couples to another multiplet @xmath24 : @xmath25 however , as @xmath22 contains one more component than @xmath24 , this can not render every component of @xmath22 massive .",
    "thus , @xmath22 must couple to another multiplet .",
    "we can either couple @xmath22 to another multiplet with @xmath26 components , or to one with @xmath27 components .",
    "if we couple it to another multiplet with @xmath26 components , our fourth multiplet must contain @xmath28 components in order to balance the number of particles in even-@xmath23 and odd-@xmath23 multiplets , and our model contains multiplets of size @xmath23 , @xmath26 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we instead couple @xmath22 to a multiplet with @xmath27 components , we obtain multiplets of size @xmath23 , @xmath23 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "these two choices are clearly degenerate by a redefinition of @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore can write the four members of our polyplet as : @xmath29    next , we note that , for a given value of @xmath30 , the members of @xmath31 will have @xmath27 distinct values for their electric charge , @xmath32 . in order for all of these fields to become massive via yukawa couplings with @xmath22 and @xmath33 , these same values of @xmath34 , but with opposite sign , must be represented in the components of @xmath22 and @xmath33 , which requires that @xmath35 .",
    "we therefore take the yukawa couplings of @xmath31 as @xmath36 from which we can deduce that @xmath37    now we consider the yukawa couplings involving @xmath38 .",
    "there are three possibilities for these couplings .",
    "first , @xmath38 could couple to both @xmath22 and @xmath33 . in this case , we yield couplings analogous to those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukplus ] ) , and we trivially obtain @xmath39 .",
    "however , it is also possible that @xmath38 couples only to @xmath22 or only to @xmath33 . in these cases , one can have either a coupling of the form @xmath40 or one of the form @xmath41 which yields @xmath42 or @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "we will thus adopt the following notation for our fermion multiplets : @xmath44 where @xmath45 or @xmath46 .    with these preliminaries",
    "out of the way , we will now explore the constraints on @xmath23 , and the multiplet hypercharges imposed by anomaly cancellation .      when building models which contain new particles or interactions , one must take care not to ruin the cancellation of triangle anomalies which occurs in the sm .",
    "( for a related work on anomaly - free sets of fermions , see @xcite . ) as our multiplets are not charged under @xmath3 , there are only three anomaly relations relevant here : @xmath47-gravity - gravity , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "these three relations take the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 .    when we apply these constraints to the quantum numbers of our multiplets shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qnums ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 where , for clarity , we have written the third relation in terms of @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath54 .",
    "let us examine the first relation in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : anomy ] ) .",
    "this equation has two solutions ; @xmath55 or @xmath56 . plugging either of these solutions into the other two equations in ( [ eq : anomy ] ) , we obtain @xmath57 .",
    "however , we note that , for @xmath57 , odd",
    "@xmath23 implies that our multiplets contain particles of half - integer charge .",
    "as such fractionally - charged ( and stable ) particles are observationally ruled out @xcite , we insist on even @xmath23 and , therefore , @xmath56 , yielding the multiplets , @xmath58 , when summed over all multiplets , yields an integer ; thus , this choice also satisfies the witten anomaly condition @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath59    this set of quantum numbers , however , allows dimension-3 mass terms like @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , where again @xmath15 is the multiplication needed to make an @xmath4 singlet . we would like to disallow these terms , in order to have a predictive model with masses set by the electroweak scale .",
    "we can do this either by introducing additional fields to loosen the constraints set by anomaly cancellation , or by assigning a new conserved charge to our multiplets . for simplicity , here , we will impose the conservation of a new charge , which we refer to as `` pseudo - lepton number '' .",
    "a discussion of how we can instead loosen the restrictions imposed by anomaly cancellation via the introduction of additional fields is given in the appendix .    with all of the hypercharges",
    "now specified , we briefly discuss whether or not the four allowed yukawa couplings are sufficient to render every member of the polyplet massive .",
    "to see this , we revisit the couplings of @xmath31 given in eq .",

    "two members of @xmath68 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , couple to only one component of either @xmath70 or @xmath67 and are thus mass eigenstates . however , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 couples to a linear combination of one component from each @xmath23-plet , @xmath79 while the orthogonal combination of @xmath80 and @xmath81 remains massless .",
    "when we include the analogous couplings of @xmath82 , @xmath83 these previously massless combinations will receive yukawa couplings as long as @xmath84 . as the coefficients @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 are functions of arbitrary yukawa couplings , it is reasonable to expect that they can generally be adjusted to render all of the fields massive , as long as none of the relevant clebsch - gordon coefficients are zero .",

    "we will take the simplest polyplet which yields particles with integer electric charge , @xmath87 .",

    "we will return to this in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] when we discuss the interplay between these results and constraints from direct detection .",
    "lastly , we briefly mention a few other possible constraints on the polyplet model .",
    "first , as the couplings of our new fields contain a complex phase @xmath150 , it is possible that our model contains contributions to cp - violating observables , such as electric dipole moments ( edms ) of sm particles ( constraints on which can be found in @xcite ) , once we move beyond tree - level calculations .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath150 can be chosen to be small ; we thus do not consider constraints from edms here , but they could be of use in a more specific model .",
    "also , as has been pointed out in @xcite , the addition of new heavy fermions to the sm can have ramifications for vacuum stability ; here , we simply assume that this issue will be resolved by some other new physics added to the sm .",
    "we now move on to discuss the viability of @xmath180 as a dm candidate .",
    "as the lightest member of our polyplet , @xmath180 is stable and therefore a potential dark matter candidate .",
    "( for large @xmath23 , this would be a result of there being no dimension - four @xmath4-invariant operators which couple the members of our polyplet to the sm fermions ; for @xmath87 , it is enforced by our choice of pseudo - lepton number . ) in order for @xmath180 to possibly be a realistic dm candidate , it must fulfill two basic requirements .",
    "first , it must annihilate to sm particles in the early universe sufficiently to have a relic density which is equal to or less than the observed dm density today , and , second , it must interact with nucleons sufficiently weakly that it evades current constraints from direct detection . both of these processes are mediated via interactions of @xmath180 with the @xmath106 boson , the higgs boson , or a combination of the two .    in trying to simultaneously fulfill the relic density and direct detection requirements ,",
    "a potential conflict arises .",
    "if dm is a thermal relic , its observed density of @xmath243 implies a thermally - averaged annihilation cross - section of @xmath244 .",
    "( for a general review of the status of dark matter and its detection see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "the observation that this cross - section is typical of weak - scale processes is commonly referred to as the wimp miracle .",
    "however , direct detection experiments have put constraints on dm - nucleon cross - sections as stringent as @xmath245 @xcite . if dm - nucleon interactions are mediated by physics at a new scale @xmath246 , dm - nucleon cross - sections",
    "would typically be of order @xmath247 @xcite , where @xmath248 is the dm - nucleon reduced mass , @xmath249 . from this",
    ", one can see that a value of @xmath250 gev or even @xmath251 tev would produce a dm - nucleon cross - section which is ruled out by direct - detection experiments by several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , in order to have a dm candidate which simultaneously has an acceptable relic density and evades the direct detection bounds , there must be some significant difference between the physics which controls the dm annihilation and that which dominates dm scattering with nucleons .",
    "as a first example , we consider the case of a relatively light @xmath180 , @xmath252,where the @xmath180 can only annihilate to the light sm fermions .",
    "as long as @xmath253 is not very small ( and annihilation via a @xmath13 is non - resonant ) , annihilation via a @xmath106 will dominate over @xmath13-mediated processes .",
    "if we take the @xmath106 coupling to be full - strength , @xmath254 , @xmath180 will comprise a subdominant component of dm , yet will fail to evade direct detection constraints . also , as long as both dm annihilation and nucleon scattering are dominated by diagrams mediated by a @xmath106 boson , adjusting the coupling of @xmath180 to the @xmath106 will not help mitigate this conflict . although reducing @xmath253 will reduce the effective coupling between the dm and nucleons , it will similarly reduce the annihilation cross - section , thus increasing the current - day relic density ; this effect will compensate for the reduced coupling , leaving the direct - detection constraints largely unchanged .",
    "therefore , we must have non - negligible contributions to @xmath180 annihilation from processes mediated by the @xmath13 .    if we keep @xmath255 but decrease the mass - diagonal coupling between the @xmath106 and @xmath180 to zero such as in the simplified scenario we explored in the discussion on oblique parameters in sec .",
    "[ sec : const ] , we can have @xmath180 interact with the sm entirely via the higgs . in this case , one might hope that the direct - detection cross - section will be sufficiently suppressed by light quark yukawa couplings to evade the relevant constraints .",
    "if @xmath154 is small , however , @xmath180 can only annihilate to the light sm fermions , and , thus , the dominant piece of this cross - section is suppressed by the yukawa coupling of the @xmath256 quark .",
    "unless @xmath257 , this annihilation cross - section is too small to yield a reasonable relic density . additionally , if one chooses @xmath154 to obtain the correct relic density , direct detection bounds still rule out this scenario for a light @xmath180 .",
    "the direct detection cross - section is dominated by the @xmath258-quark contribution to the nucleon , @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the factor which converts between quark - level and nucleon - level effective operators ; we take this value from @xcite which used @xmath261 mev .",
    "( we note that the error bar on this factor is large and different conversion factors are used in the literature ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "additionally , the expected contributions from @xmath262 , @xmath263 , and heavy quarks are smaller than or comparable to the error on the value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsnuc ] ) . )",
    "this yields @xmath264 with an error bar of the same order .",
    "as the limits on the spin - independent dm cross - section from xenon100 @xcite are @xmath265 , this scenario is ruled out by approximately an order of magnitude for low higgs masses .",
    "if we are willing to allow @xmath180 to comprise only a very subdominant component of dm , we can try to use resonant annihilation via the higgs to make the current relic density of @xmath180 small . in this case",
    ", we tune the @xmath180 mass to be @xmath266 , but we do not fine - tune the @xmath106 coupling to be small .",
    "although the @xmath180-nucleon cross - section will not be suppressed , one can hope that the reduced @xmath180 relic density will allow @xmath180 to evade the direct detection constraints at the expense of identifying the primary component(s ) of dm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reso ] , we show the relic density @xmath267 of @xmath180 as a function of @xmath154 assuming resonant annihilation through @xmath13 for @xmath268 gev ; we include the effects of thermal averaging similarly to what was done in @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "we see that it is possible to achieve relic densities as low as @xmath269 .",
    "we note , however , that only for points very close to resonance does the resonant annihilation cross - section approach the cross - section for annihilation through a @xmath106 ; the relic density in the case of annihilation via the @xmath106 is shown separately in the plot .",
    "thus , this suppression is inadequate to evade direct detection constraints ; the @xmath180-nucleon cross - section via @xmath106 exchange calculated for xenon100 is @xmath270 , more than @xmath271 orders of magnitude too large to be compatible with the results of xenon100 @xcite , even given the above relic density suppression .",
    "a solution is possible , however , for larger @xmath154 if the higgs sector contains a heavy scalar ; this may happen if the higgs sector contains multiple scalars or if the @xmath217-gev particle discovered at lhc turns out to not be closely related to electroweak symmetry breaking . if we tune the mass - diagonal coupling of @xmath180 to the @xmath106 to zero ( @xmath253 must be @xmath272 to evade direct detection limits ) , and increase @xmath154 so that annihilations to gauge bosons @xmath273 and @xmath274 become possible , we can simultaneously fulfill the relic density requirement and evade the constraints from direct detection . in this case , the annihilation cross - section for @xmath180 is not suppressed by any small yukawa couplings , while the main contribution to the direct - detection cross - section is still suppressed by the @xmath258 quark yukawa , assuming sm higgs couplings .",
    "this solution does , however , require @xmath180 to couple to a rather heavy higgs boson , @xmath275 .",
    "we plot the relic density of @xmath180 in this case in fig .",

    "<S> these fermions are charged under @xmath0 , and their quantum numbers are determined by requiring all new particles to obtain masses via yukawa couplings and all triangle anomalies to cancel as in the standard model ; more than one multiplet is required and we refer to such a set of these multiplets as a _ </S>",
