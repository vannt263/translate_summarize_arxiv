    "test particle motion in realistic gravitational fields is of obvious astrophysical importance and at the same time it provides reliable evidence of the properties of those gravitational fields .",
    "however , in many actual astrophysical systems the particles are not moving freely but are influenced by ambient matter , electromagnetic fields and radiation . in typical situations , these  physical \" effects are probably even more important than fine details of the spacetime geometry alone .",
    "the most remarkable conditions , from the point of view of general relativity as well as astrophysics , appear near very compact objects where both the pure gravitational and other  physical \" effects typically become extraordinarily strong .    in the present paper we focus on the motion of test particles in a spherically symmetric gravitational field , under the action of a thomson - type interaction with radiation emitted or accreted by a compact center .",
    "this kind of problem was first investigated by poynting @xcite using newtonian gravity and then in the framework of linearized general relativity by robertson @xcite .",
    "it involves competition between gravity and radiation drag , which may lead to interesting types of motion which do not occur in strictly vacuum circumstances . in particular",
    ", there arises the question of whether equilibrium behavior like circular orbit motion or even  staying at rest \" are possible in some cases .",
    "theoretical aspects of the poynting - robertson effect as well as its astrophysical relevance in specific situations have been studied by many authors since the original pioneering work .",
    "recently we considered this same effect in the relativistic setting by studying test particles orbiting in the equatorial plane of a schwarzschild or kerr black hole , assuming that the source of radiation is located symmetrically not far from the horizon ( in the case of outgoing flux ) .",
    "we first chose the radiation field to be directed purely radially with respect to the zero - angular - momentum observers so that it too had zero angular momentum @xcite , but then also considered a more general case of radiation having some ( arbitrary ) angular momentum @xcite ( see these papers for a more thorough overview of the references ) . while ingoing radiation might at first seem rather unmotivated , its consideration can give some rough idea about particle motion inside an accretion disk with strong radiation emanating from the disk , at least in the plane of the disk .    here",
    "we intend to compare the limiting simpler case of the poynting - robertson effect due to a purely radial ( zero - angular - momentum ) test radiation flux in a schwarzschild background with the treatment using a self - consistent radiation flux in the exact , vaidya spherically symmetric spacetime whose source includes a null dust @xcite",
    ". similarly one could think of comparing the general nonzero angular momentum test flux case in the kerr spacetime background with the rotating kerr - vaidya spacetime @xcite , but the energy - momentum tensor of this latter exact solution was shown not to be interpretable in terms of a null dust alone as in the nonrotating case @xcite , so we will not address that issue here . since the simpler vaidya spacetime contains an arbitrary function @xmath0 which describes a time - dependent mass for the central object , there is a freedom to choose that function in many ways , but we limit our attention to a relatively simple evolution of this function in our applications .",
    "in particular when an appropriate derivative of this function @xmath0 is constant , one models a phase of evolution of the central object in which the central mass changes at a constant rate . in this nonstatic situation , it no longer makes sense to seek radial equilibrium orbits as in the corresponding static test flux case , but one can look for some kind of adiabatically changing equivalent orbits .    after summarizing some basic properties of the vaidya spacetime , we write out and reduce the equations describing timelike motion ( with an effective force term describing the particle - radiation interaction ) in schwarzschild - like spherical coordinates with retarded / advanced time .",
    "next we examine the appropriate limit of the vaidya spacetime which leads to the scenario of a test flux in the schwarzschild spacetime , in particular to see how the schwarzschild radial equilibrium orbits fit into the more general situation .",
    "then several numerical examples are shown illustrating typical types of motion .",
    "the gravitational field associated with a spherically symmetric body of variable mass @xmath0 is described by vaidya s nonvacuum solution of the einstein equations @xcite , representing an algebraically special petrov type d spacetime like the schwarzschild metric it generalizes .",
    "the corresponding line element written in schwarzschild - like coordinates is given by [ metrictr ] s^2=-()^2 + + r^2(^2+^2 ^ 2 ) , with @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote partial derivatives with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "a more useful form is obtained by introducing eddington - finkelstein - like coordinates through the transformation to the null coordinate @xmath6 by u= , so that the line element becomes [ metricur ] s^2=-n^2u^2 2u r + r^2(^2+^2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath7 .",
    "hereafter we will use the eddington - finkelstein - like form ( [ metricur ] ) .",
    "its inverse has non - zero components g^ur = g_ur , g^rr =- g_uu , g^=(g_)^-1 , g^=(g_)^-1 , so the raising or lowering of indices involves the simple relations @xmath8 . in the case of non - positive / non - negative @xmath9 ,",
    "i.e. , for a source loosing / gaining energy , @xmath6 represents retarded / advanced time and one has @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "( outgoing radiation ) while lower signs to @xmath11 ( ingoing radiation ) , so that @xmath12 .",
    "the advanced null coordinate is conventionally denoted by @xmath13 , but we keep @xmath6 in both cases ( distinguishing between them by signs ) . ] we will allow for both possibilities  in fact we leave the @xmath14 evolution completely general , with several important specific cases treated as examples .",
    "the metric ( [ metricur ] ) has a curvature singularity at @xmath15 and a coordinate singularity at @xmath16 which corresponds to an apparent ( but not event ) horizon .",
    "actually , on the @xmath16 hypersurface the metric reduces to @xmath17 which is spacelike in both cases , i.e. , with @xmath18 . in the @xmath19",
    "limit the metric ( [ metricur ] ) reduces to the schwarzschild metric written in terms of the retarded / advanced time @xmath20\\,\\ ] ] for which @xmath21 and @xmath22 are both killing vector fields .",
    "global properties of the vaidya spacetime ( its conformal structure ) are summarized in section 9.5 of @xcite together with the most relevant references .",
    "see also @xcite where different definitions of mass ( section 4.3.5 ) and the distinction between apparent and event horizons ( section 5.1.8 ) are illustrated using the vaidya spacetime as an example",
    ".    evaluating the einstein equations @xmath23 for this metric , one finds that the energy - momentum tensor has only one non - zero component in these coordinates [ tmunu ] t_uu = t^rr= > 0 .",
    "such a @xmath24 can be interpreted as a null dust representing  pure radiation , \" namely @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a purely radial outgoing / ingoing null vector and @xmath27 depends on the normalization chosen for @xmath26 .",
    "for example , if one takes @xmath28 , then t^rr=   ^2= .",
    "this choice for @xmath29 means that @xmath30 ; in particular , the energy of the radiation particles is proportional to @xmath31 . in the corresponding schwarzschild spacetime with this value for @xmath32",
    ", @xmath29 agrees with the choice used in @xcite . as in that case , one checks easily that @xmath29 is tangent to a congruence of affinely parametrized null geodesics since @xmath33 this congruence has nonzero expansion @xmath34 but zero vorticity .",
    "the most natural test observers suitable for physical interpretation are those at rest in the spatial coordinate grid at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; their 4-velocity field is [ static - obs ] e_u= _ u. a convenient spatial orthonormal triad tied to this observer congruence is [ framestatic ] e_r = n(_r _ u ) , e_= _ , e_=_. this observer congruence is accelerated and has nonzero expansion and shear , @xmath38 but its vorticity vanishes , ( ) ^^[;]+a()^[^]=0 , so it is hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "in fact these observers follow the @xmath4 coordinate lines orthogonal to the @xmath4 coordinate hypersurfaces in the original coordinate system , and in the schwarzschild case @xmath39 they are just the usual static observers .",
    "when studying motion of massive test particles ( rest mass @xmath40 ) in the vaidya spacetime , one can either restrict attention to geodesics , or allow the particles to interact physically with the radiation in terms of which the energy - momentum tensor is interpreted . a simple way to model",
    "this interaction is to assume that the force on the particle is proportional to the 4-momentum density of radiation observed in the particle s rest frame . denoting the particle s 4-velocity by @xmath41 and acceleration by @xmath42 , this yields the equation of motion [ motion ] ma(u)^=-p(u)^_t^_u^ _ rad(u)^ , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are particle s proper time and rest mass",
    ", @xmath45 is the effective interaction cross section ( its dimension is length squared ) and @xmath46 is the projector to the particle s instantaneous rest space .",
    "such a force formula is independent of the direction and frequency of radiation ( and the interaction  efficiency \" @xmath45 is also independent of the momentum - density magnitude ) and can perhaps be adequate in situations when thomson scattering is a dominant interaction mode .",
    "let us divide the equation ( [ motion ] ) by @xmath44 ( denoting @xmath47 ) and write it out in the @xmath48 coordinates .",
    "since the energy - momentum tensor has only one non - zero component @xmath49 ( [ tmunu ] ) , one has [ motion / m ] = -^_u^u^ -(g^u+u^u^u)t_uuu^u .",
    "first , the latitudinal component = -u^r u^+(u^)^2 -t_uu(u^u)^2 u^confirms that the interaction leaves the motion planar : choosing @xmath50 and @xmath51 at some instant , one sees that at that instant @xmath52 too and so the particle remains in the (  equatorial \" ) plane . substituting @xmath50 and @xmath51 into the other components of ( [ motion / m ] ) , we have @xmath53",
    "the 4-velocity normalization condition @xmath54 , explicitly -1 = -n^2(u^u)^22u^u u^r+r^2(u^)^2 [ norm - contra ] , enables the simplification of the longest equation ( [ ur - contra ] ) to [ ur - contra - shorter ] = -+(r-3m)(u^)^2 ( u^u)^2 -(u^u u^r1)t_uuu^u .",
    "one could instead use the normalization condition to eliminate one of the three 4-velocity components from all of the equations trying to make the latter a closed system , but unfortunately , even with a  favorable \" evolution of the mass @xmath55 , exact integration of such a system is almost never possible due to the a priori unknown dependence @xmath56 . in any case , the most important  non - schwarzschild \" feature ( besides the interaction terms scaled by @xmath57 ) is the third term @xmath58 in the radial equation ( [ ur - contra - shorter ] ) .",
