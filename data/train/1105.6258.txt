    "the ratchet effect @xcite presents a suitable toolbox for manipulations of ultracold matter , which allows to set a quantum particle into directed motion without applying gradients or running - wave potentials @xcite .",
    "periodic modulations of the confining potential is prerequisite for the effect to occur , and there are plenty of different setups and blueprints of ratchet machinery @xcite . an interesting class of ratchet systems",
    "are dissipation - free hamiltonian ratchets , classical @xcite and , even more intriguingly , quantum ones @xcite . for example , a bi - harmonic flashing potential with periodically and uniformly modulated potential height @xcite , could be turned into a conveyer belt for a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of rubidium atoms @xcite .",
    "the quantum ratchet effect can be utilized as a promising device capable to deliver ultracold atoms to desirable locations . yet the coherent quantum transport in ac - driven periodic potentials is severely hampered by diffusion , additionally enhanced by tunneling effects @xcite .",
    "the issue of the transport efficiency @xcite becomes now of importance , meaning that one should search for a set of optimal parameters in order to maximize the correspondingly chosen efficiency measure .",
    "it is intuitive that the ratchet transport with large transport velocity and minimal dispersion rate would be preferable in the context of the delivery problem .",
    "this reasoning naturally leads to a quantum analog of the classical pclet number concept @xcite , which has already been used in the field of classical ratchets , both for overdamped @xcite and , as well , for underdamped @xcite models .",
    "however , the extension of this classical measure to the quantum limit is by no means straightforward .",
    "different from the classical limit , where the diffusive dispersion scales linearly , @xmath0 , the quantum diffusion is ballistic - like , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this fact makes the direct implication of the pclet number for the quantum ratchet problem not feasible . in this work",
    "we introduce a quantum analog of the pclet number in order to specify the quality of ratchet transport . using this concept",
    "we then aim in exploring the impact of diffusion and tunneling on the nonequilibrium quantum transport , focusing on initial conditions in the form of a localized gaussian - like wave packet .",
    "our objective is to identify optimal regimes , when the directed transport is minimally swamped by the dispersive spreading . by use of the floquet formalism @xcite , which provides the complete information on the state of the system at any instant of time ,",
    "we demonstrate how the analysis of the floquet spectrum of the driven system allows one to judge the quality of a flashing ratchet as a suitable delivery vehicle for ultracold atoms .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",

    "the hilbert space of the system can be imagined as a set of  conveyer belt \"  eigenstates , each one of which is moving with its own velocity , and the overall ratchet current depends on how the initial wave packet @xmath34 was distributed among the various belts @xcite .",
    "the transport properties of floquet states are governed by the space - time ( a)symmetries of corresponding hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "there are four types of relevant symmetry transformations for the hamiltonians of the type , see tab .  1 .",
    "two of them , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , demand the space inversion , and the remaining two , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , involve the explicit time reversal .",
    "each transformation changes the sign of the quasimomentum , and maps every floquet band onto itself , a negative branch onto a positive one , and vice versa , @xmath39=\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}[-\\kappa]$ ] .",

    "independent of a particular shape of the initial cloud and the choice of starting time @xmath44 , the asymptotic current would be absent  for any initial state drawn from the subspace @xmath45 .",
    "although such the initial state can serve as a good approximation of a diluted bec cloud smeared over sufficiently many wells of the periodic potentials @xcite , it can not mimic the experimentally relevant situation with a partially delocalized wave packet , @xmath46 .",
    "such a more realistic wave packet occupies a certain region in the @xmath23-space , and therefore , floquet states of different quasimomenta @xmath23 and band indices @xmath22 , will contribute to the wave - packet dynamics according to the corresponding weights , @xmath47 , see eq . .",
    "we could make the reasonable assumption that at time @xmath44 we start out with the initial cloud in form of a symmetric wave - packet , @xmath48 . as it is the case with the dynamics restricted to the subspace of @xmath45 , the evolution of a wave packet depends on the initial starting time @xmath44 , fig .",
    "in contrast to its classical counterpart , however , where the chaotic dynamics erases the memory about the initial conditions of the system preparation exponentially fast @xcite , a fully _ coherent _ quantum ratchet maintains this information , which is encoded in the coefficients @xmath49 forever .",
    "all the symmetries from table 1 , except the first one , @xmath50 , involve time transformations  time inversion in @xmath51 , time shift in @xmath52 , and a combined transformation in @xmath53  so that the contributions from the eigenstates with opposite quasimomenta , might be different for a given , fixed @xmath44 , @xmath54 , even when one ( or all ) of the symmetries @xmath55 are obeyed .",

    "a desirable performance of a quantum ratchet transport is when the spreading of the wave packet constitutes a slow process when compared to the overall directed motion of the packet center of mass .",
    "this limit would correspond to a highly coherent transport , when the ballistic motion of the atomic cloud is minimally hampered by diffusion .",
    "the natural measure of the quality of the ratchet transport would then be the quotient of the directed current and a proper diffusive characteristics . the diffusion is naturally quantified by using the dispersion of the wave packet , @xmath80 . in the case of normal diffusion ,",
    "dispersion scales like @xmath81 , and in the classical limit , it perfectly describes the kinetics of over- @xcite and under - damped @xcite ratchets .",

    "the diffusion coefficient and the current are in units of the square of the recoil momentum and the recoil momentum , correspondingly.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    among the several parameters of the system dynamics it is the driving frequency @xmath92 which presents a most suitable control parameter .",
    "this driving frequency @xmath92 allows one to tune the ratchet into resonant regimes @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the driving can conveniently be varied in experiments @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath100 on the driving frequency , see fig .",
    "2(a ) , does not keep abreast with the corresponding current dependence , see fig .",

    "note that although the asymptotic absolute current values @xmath101 are identical at the driving values @xmath69 and @xmath102 , the quality of the transport in the first point is almost three times better than in the second .    in order to gain insight into mechanisms of highly - coherent quantum transport , we resort to the analysis of the system floquet spectrum .",
    "first we sorted out all the floquet bands according to their kinetic energy , and then ordered them into an ascending order .",
    "this is a reasonable procedure , since the states with kinetic energies that are much larger than the characteristic energy @xmath103 , would not contribute tangibly to the initially prepared wave packet .",

    "consider first the ultimate case with only two bands , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , that are populated initially .",
    "if the bands are parallel at the vicinity of @xmath45 , both have non - zero slopes and share the initial cloud equally , @xmath110 ; then the corresponding effective diffusion coefficient would be equal to zero .",
    "accordingly , the quality @xmath111 would be infinite in this case .",
    "this regime is approached at the frequency @xmath69 ( point of a high - quality transport in fig .",
    "2(c ) ) , see fig .",
    "the situation at the frequency @xmath102 is contrary to the discussed one , see fig .",
    "there we also find only two mostly populated bands which exhibit an avoided crossing ( ac ) .",
    "the bands have different slopes , and according to the last factor in eq .",
    ", this implies strong diffusion .",
    "both bands are almost horizontal within the ac region , so that they yield almost no current .",
    "most of the contribution to the overall current stems from the parts of the bands , located away from the ac region .",
    "although the bands have a large slope , thus producing a directed current which matches that of the regime at the point @xmath69 , the presence of strong diffusion decreases the transport quality by factor of three ( point of a low - quality transport in fig .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the coherent quantum transport of a quantum wave packet in a flashing periodic potential .",
    "the regime of high - quality ratchet transport corresponds to the ballistic center - of - mass motion minimally obstructed by quantum diffusion .",
    "the quality is a tunable characteristics , and it is indeed possible to optimize the quantum ratchet performance by tailoring the parameters of the driving flashing potential .",
    "the transport quality @xmath111 is also an experimentally relevant characteristics : the ratchet current can be measured by using the time - of - flight technique @xcite , while the dispersion of bec cloud can be estimated directly from absorption images @xcite .",
    "the quality of the transport depends on the initial time @xmath44 , since the band populations , @xmath112 , are functions of starting time @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , different choices of the starting time @xmath44 may lead to regimes of different transport quality even when all the driving parameters of the system hamiltonian are fixed .",
    "the dependence on the dispersion of the initial wave packet , @xmath113 , is even more stringent .",
    "namely , the localization in the @xmath114-space is inversely proportional to the localization in @xmath23-space .",
    "therefore , a very _ delocalized _ initial wave packet , smeared over many periods of the optical potential , would be strongly _ localized _ at the point @xmath43 in the quasimomentum space .",
    "the asymptotic transport dynamics of the wave packet can be evaluated from the behavior of the quasienergy bands at the center of the brillouin zone , by using eqs .   and .",
    "the localization in @xmath23-space , thereby , makes the effect sharper and typically leads to the enhancement of the quality of ratchet transport , see fig .",
    "2(c ) . on the contrary",
    ", the ratchet effect would be faint for an initial wave packet in the form of a very narrow peak in @xmath114-space .",
    "strong localization of the cloud would correspond to an almost uniform distribution over the brillouin zone , and since the average band velocities are all equal to zero , @xmath115 dk = \\epsilon_{\\alpha } [ -\\pi / l ] - \\epsilon_{\\alpha } [ \\pi / l ] = 0 $ ] , such the initial distribution will yield almost imperceptible current . at the same time",
    "the spreading rate would be huge .",
    "paradoxically enough , a very narrow wave packet will lead to quantum ratchet transport of a very poor quality @xcite .",
    "our results can be considered as a first step towards an optimization scheme of cold atom engines .",
    "the ultimate aim of the research in this direction is an operational recipe , a protocol , which would allow one to maximize the quality of a quantum ratchet transport without going deeply into the analysis of the particular system of interest .",
    "one of the intriguing subdirections is the role of disorder in the functioning of quantum ratchets .",
    "namely , a following question is of special interest : can a pinch of disorder in the underlying optical potential improve the performance of quantum ratchets ?",
    "in other words , can the disorder - induced localization @xcite slow down the diffusive spreading without affecting the center - of - mass velocity ?",
