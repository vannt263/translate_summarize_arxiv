    "hence , the relevance of the backscattering for a particular pair @xmath144 of layers can be controlled by adjusting the bosonic populations in individual tubes .",
    "due to the spatially non - local nature of dipolar interactions , the composite superfluid phase , [ cs ] , can form between tubes with the same filling factors regardless of their geometrical positions .",
    "for example , in a system of @xmath145 tubes where @xmath146 ( here we consider @xmath147 ) , with all other values @xmath148 , the harmonics @xmath149 can become relevant , while all others remain irrelevant ( simply because of the oscillating phases @xmath150 , with @xmath151 , in the corresponding cos - harmonics in eq.([bs ] ) ) .",

    "<S> hard - core dipolar bosons trapped in a parallel stack of @xmath0 1d optical lattices ( tubes ) can develop several phases made of composites of particles from different tubes : superfluids , supercounterfluids and insulators as well as mixtures of those . </S>",
    "<S> bosonization analysis shows that these phases are threshold - less with respect to the dipolar interaction , with the key  control knob \" being filling factors in each tube , provided the inter - tube tunneling is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the effective _ ab - initio _ quantum monte carlo algorithm capturing these phases is introduced and some results are presented . </S>"
