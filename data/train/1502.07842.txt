    "in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in studying biological systems in terms of the existence of nontrivial quantum effects @xcite .",
    "especially the excitation energy transfer ( eet ) between chromophores in photosynthetic complexes has been heavily studied ever since quantum coherence between excited states in the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex was experimentally verified by two dimensional electronic spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "not only was the existence of coherent pathways in the fmo complex revealed , quantum coherence was also shown to last much longer than expected for such large and noisy systems , and a hypothesis is that this may play a role in the known very efficient eet in photosynthetic complexes @xcite .",
    "since then , several attempts to explain why photosynthetic complexes could benefit from coherent eet have been made @xcite .",
    "one such is that the quantum coherence could help to direct the energy flow towards the reaction center in a unidirectional manner @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence for coherent eet in the fmo complex motivates the development of new methods to model the excited state dynamics of chromophores in a surrounding protein scaffold .",
    "it has become clear that markovian models can not fully capture the behaviour of the system - environment interactions in these systems and hence non - markovian models have to be considered . based on the hierarchial expansion technique proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , ishizaki and fleming refined the theoretical framework and developed a tool for investigating the excited state dynamics in a photosynthetic complex @xcite .",
    "this form of hierarchially coupled equations of motions ( heom ) has served as the benchmarking method for these systems since it is able to describe quantum coherent motion and incoherent electron hopping in a unified manner @xcite . using this method , sarovar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite examined quantum entanglement in the fmo complex and found that bipartite entanglement of chromophores exists on a time scale relevant for the mechanism of eet .",
    "since entanglement can be used as a resource in quantum information processing tasks , it was speculated if the findings could play a role in explaining the near unity efficiency for these complexes to convert solar light into chemical energy .",
    "quantum nonlocality , as introduced by bell @xcite , is another correlation property of composite quantum systems .",
    "while quantum entanglement , already mentioned by schrdinger as the key property that distinguishes quantum mechanics from the classical world @xcite , is a meaningful property only for quantum systems , nonlocality is given by a criterion that is formed without specifying whether the systems are quantum mechanical or not .",
    "in the quantum - mechanical context , although entanglement and nonlocality are the same for pure states , this is not in general true for mixed states , i.e. , they are inequivalent properties for composite quantum systems @xcite . in particular , nonlocality is a stronger correlation property than entanglement in the sense that nonlocality implies entanglement but not vice versa @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to examine whether bipartite nonlocality can exist during eet in the fmo complex , which would imply a striking nonclassical feature of this process . by studying the existence of quantum nonlocality in such a complex , it is possible to add insights into if and how quantum effects play a role in photosynthesis ; insights that could be of interest for artificial photosynthesis and solar cells as well as for quantum computation . in recent studies",
    "@xcite , a considerable enhancement in the efficiency due to quantum coherence was found in model systems of photosynthesis mimicking solar cells .",
    "if such discoveries also can be connected to the existence of entanglement and nonlocality , it would be desirable to explore the underlying physics of such phenomena further .",
    "eet in the fmo complex has been modeled by employing the heom method @xcite .",
    "a description of the fmo complex as well as the quantities and conditions used to model eet , is given followed by a brief review of the heom based model of the fmo complex , modified by including an explicit mechanism of the excitation energy trapping at the reaction center .",
    "the fmo complex is a photosynthetic complex found in green sulfur bacteria , _",
    "chlorobaculum tepidum_. it consists of three identical monomers , each containing seven chromophores embedded in a protein scaffold , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the structure of this complex as well as its site excitation energies and inter - site couplings have been experimentally investigated by different spectroscopic methods @xcite and the system has been used as a model for larger light harvesting complexes for more than 35 years @xcite .",
    "the fmo complex does not include any antenna molecules .",
    "in other words , it is not responsible for capturing the light energy , but only for transferring it to the reaction center .",
    "the antenna molecules are located in such a way that they can transfer excitation energy to the three monomer units .",
    "we restrict the system studied to one monomer ; a reasonably simplifying assumption in the description of correlations accompanying eet in this system .",
    "the individual chromophores in the fmo complex can be modeled as two level systems ( tlss ) by taking into account only the @xmath0 transition , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the singlet ground state and singlet first excited state , respectively .",
    "furthermore , since green sulfur bacteria recieve very little sunlight in their natural habitat @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that the fmo complex only contains one such excitation at a time .",
    "this reduces the electronic hamiltonian of the fmo complex ( one monomer ) to have the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electronic excitation energy of chromophore @xmath5 when being in its excited state , while the other chromophores remain in their ground state .",
    "this corresponds to the localized state @xmath6 where the superscript denotes the chromophore site .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 is the dipole coupling describing the electrostatic interaction between the charge distribution of chromophores @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "it depends strongly on the dipole moment orientations and relative positions of the chromophores in the protein complex structure @xcite .",
    "calculations suggest that the most favourable structure is that chromophores 3 and 4 are linked directly to the reaction center @xcite . this result has been confirmed experimentally when examining the fmo complex with masspectrometry @xcite .",
    "since the structure of the fmo is known @xcite , this implies that chromophores 1 and 6 connect to the base plate ( that is the part of the antenna molecule complex that connects it to the fmo ) .",
    "the simplest way to model eet in the fmo complex would hence be to assume a localized excitation on either chromophore 1 or 6 as the initial conditions for eet .",
    "this can be written as @xmath9 however , since the distance between the antenna molecules and the base plate as well as the distance between the base plate and the fmo are so large ( @xmath102 nm @xcite and @xmath101.5 nm @xcite , respectively ) in comparison to the intracomplex distances , a model that better captures the condition for initial excitation of the fmo complex in its natural habitat is to assume that the excitation is transferred from the base plate to the fmo by frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) @xcite .",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , in proportion to their occurrence at chromophore 1 or 6 .",

    "the protein scaffold is modeled as a set of harmonic oscillator modes , i.e. , a phonon bath , which represents nuclear motion , both intramolecular and those of the environment .",
    "the transfer of excitation energy from one chromophore to another occurs via nonequilibrium nuclear configuration ( phonon states ) in accordance with a vertical franck - condon transition .",
    "the phonons , locally and linearly coupled to each chromophore @xmath5 , relax to their equilibrium states under energy loss .",

    "note that @xmath46 can be viewed as a @xmath47 dimensional hermitian matrix due to the restriction to one coherent excitation at each instant of time .",
    "quantum nonlocality is a property of composite quantum systems whose subsystems show correlations that are too strong to be explained by a local realistic theory @xcite , i.e. , a theory where physical variables ( such as , e.g. , positions and momenta of particles ) are assumed to have well - defined local values prior to measurement .",
    "the existence of quantum nonlocality was discovered when bell derived @xcite an upper bound ( bell s inequality ) for correlations between two systems to be local , and then showed that the correlations within certain composite quantum systems may exceed this limit .    since bell s original formulation of his inequality , there have been other bell - like inequalities .",
    "one such that is suitable for investigating bipartite nonlocality for tlss like the chromophores in the fmo complex is the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "it states that any set of variables @xmath48 , and @xmath49 that can take values @xmath50 must satisfy @xmath51 if a local realistic theory applies to the pairs @xmath52 and @xmath53 at distant locations . here",

    "this reduces to @xmath95 which implies that concurrence and the @xmath93 norm measure of coherence are in fact identical quantities for all chromophore pairs .",
    "thus , a nonzero concurrence can equally well be interpreted as an expression for having a nonzero coherence , rather than being a sign of correlation .",
    "this is a consequence of the restriction to the single excitation subspace of the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "this work has contributed to the investigation of eet in the fmo complex in considering bipartite quantum nonlocality between different chromophores in addition to the bipartite quantum entanglement considered in previous studies @xcite .",
    "while entanglement can alternatively be interpreted as measuring the coherences ( in the sense of @xmath93 norm of coherence ) in the fmo complex , we have shown that nonlocality can not be given this interpretation , but should instead be regarded a proper quantifier of quantum correlations between chromophore pairs .",
    "the numerical simulations show that nonlocality only exists for localized initial conditions .",
    "however , it is only observed for those chromophore pairs where one of them receives the initial excitation of the system and it drops to zero on a very short time scale ( less than 100 fs ) .",
    "it should be noted that the behavior of nonlocality found in our simulations is related to the fact that the fmo complex can typically exhibit only one excitation at a time ; by artificially including more simultaneous excitations would potentially induce a much more complicated nonlocality pattern accompanying the eet .",
    "the restriction to the single - excitation subspace would likely prevent nonlocal multipartite correlations @xcite among more than two chromophores , just as the absence of genuine multipartite entanglement for this class of states , well - known from the work by coffmann _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the fact that no nonlocality is observed when more realistic initial conditions ( fret from the antenna molecules to the fmo ) are used indicates that nonlocality is of no importance when considering eet in the fmo in its natural habitat . the entanglement still present ,",
    "represents local correlations in the sense that they can be described using a theory incorporating local realism @xcite .",
    "hence , the correlations between pairs of chromophores can be either quantum or classical , i.e. , it can not be ruled out that eet in the fmo complex just as well could be explained from an underlying local realistic framework .",
    "whether this is a result of the model used in this study or actually is according to the laws of nature , remains an open question . in relation to this latter remark",
    ", we further note that to experimentally examine the behavior of nonlocality in the fmo complex would be very challenging because it would require the ability to perform local measurements in at least two different bases , which would be hard to achieve due to the short time scale and the small distances between the chromophores .",
    "finally , the occurence of nonlocality sudden death found in our simulations with localized initial conditions is another feature that seems to indicate that persistent quantum nonlocality is probably rare in biological systems .",
