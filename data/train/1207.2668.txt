    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be classified in a variety of ways depending on the characteristics of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at various wavelengths .",
    "the commonly used division in type 1 and type 2 agn is primarily based on their properties in the uv / optical wavelengths , with type 1 objects typically showing broad emission lines , while type 2 only having narrow emission lines in their spectra . according to the unified scheme for agn @xcite , the differences between the type 1 and type 2 agn are an orientation effect , as first suggested by @xcite . for certain lines of sight",
    "the dust can obscure the central engine giving rise to a number of differences in the observed sed of agn at almost all wavelengths .",
    "this happens as dust grains , present in an optically thick region surrounding the nucleus , absorb ultraviolet photons coming from the central region and re - radiate them in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of dust around the central region of agn is the key to understanding the differences between type 1 and type 2 objects",
    ".    the variety of radiative transfer models developed to reproduce the observed dust emission in the ir can be divided in two classes : `` smooth '' models characterised by a continuous dust distribution in a toroidal or flared - disk shape in which the density can only vary smoothly within the torus , and `` clumpy '' , in which the dust is distributed in clumps or clouds .",
    "clumpy models are a more likely representation of the real dust distribution as a smooth dust distribution would result in collisions that would raise the temperature to levels too high for the dust to survive ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "smooth models were the first to be developed , being computationally simpler and , in many aspects , a good approximation when calculating the ir sed of agn .",
    "smooth models , however , confront important issues when used to match the observations : the ir bump they produced was narrower than what was observed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  [ sec : irsed ] ) ; the 10 silicate feature (  [ sec : sifeature ] ) was often observed in absorption in type 2 sources , but had barely been seen in emission in either type 1 or type 2 sources @xcite until recent observations with _ spitzer_/irs ; and the same feature in absorption in type 2 views had always been observed to be shallower than what the model predicted . with this in mind , @xcite were the first to present a torus model with dust distributed in clumps , with the silicate emission feature attenuated and the ir bump broad enough to fit the observations .",
    "the same models , however , fail to reproduce the short wavelength emission emerging from the hot dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in type 1 agn .",
    "this behaviour of the clumpy models is not specific to this particular set of models but appears in other clumpy model realisations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the success of both classes of models in fitting different parts of the observed agn seds keeps the issue of the dust distribution in agn open , as no conclusions can be drawn from the simple comparison between observed and model seds .",
    "the differences arising from the two geometries have so far been the focus of two different studies .",
    "@xcite compared their own two - dimensional radiative transfer models of smooth and clumpy tori in terms of the resulting width of the sed , strength of the silicate feature at 9.7 and isotropy parameter .",
    "they concluded that , despite the distinct nature of the models and the variations this may cause to the shape of the seds , distinguishing between the two distributions based on the broad band seds was not possible .",
    "@xcite implemented a three dimensional clumpy model and compared it with their previous continuous model @xcite as well as other clumpy configurations .",
    "their analysis , with an emphasis on the behaviour of the 9.7 silicate feature , confirmed their previous conclusion that the mid - ir seds of agn are mainly determined by the innermost part of the torus .",
    "more recently , @xcite explored the implications of clumpy and continuous dust distributions on the ir seds , by exploiting the three - dimensional radiative transfer code skirt @xcite , and found globally no significant dissimilarities in their full set of models .",
    "other than the works mentioned above , a systematic comparison between the models currently used in the literature is missing .",
    "the work we present here intends to partly fill this gap by providing a thorough comparison between the two probably most used smooth and clumpy models in the literature to date , namely an updated grid of smooth models based on fritz , franceschini & hatziminaoglou ( 2006 ) ( see  [ sec : smooth ] for the details ) and the updated clumpy model grid by @xcite .",
    "the two sets of models and the parameter space they cover are described very briefly before constructing restricted grids of the two classes of seds by matching the model parameters (  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "we then characterize and compare the two sets of seds and investigate the derived distributions of the respective model parameters (  [ sec : comparison ] ) .",
    "we finally summarise our results and expose the implications for the use of the two approaches of radiative transfer models to reproduce the observed agn seds (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the main features of the models compared in this work , describing their main features and parameters , as well as the selection of the final grids of models on which we perform the comparison .",
    "for the models details we refer to @xcite and @xcite , hereafter f06 and n08 , respectively .",
    "what follows is a brief description of the two different model grids . for a complete and detailed description see the respective papers .",
    "the grid of smooth models used for this study is based on the f06 models , with some minor updates , as described below .",

    "we now examine the properties of the ir model sed resulting from two different dust distributions , namely :     : :    the width of the ir bump , w@xmath44 , defined as the    log@xmath45 of the frequency range in which the spectrum is    more than 1/3 of its peak value ( expressed in @xmath46 )    as in e.g. @xcite ;  : :    the wavelength where the flux value ( in @xmath46 ) of the    sed peaks , @xmath35 ;  : :    the spectral index at near - ir wavelengths , defined as    @xmath47  : :    the monochromatic luminosity at 12.3 , @xmath48 .",

    "the dust temperature is a continuous and monotonic function of the distance from the central source . in a clumpy medium , instead , the non - illuminated side of the clouds , particularly those with high optical depth , will be in general much colder with respect to their illuminated side .",
    "the net result is that a whole range of temperatures can coexist within the torus at a given distance from the primary source ( see * ? ? ?",

    "three components contribute to these differences : i ) the lack of a very hot component in the clumpy models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , ii ) the primary source ( different power laws and different wavelength coverage for the two dust distributions ) , and , to a much lesser extent , iii ) the scattering in the clumpy medium , which strongly depends on the distribution of the clouds .",
    "we calculated the average fractional contribution of the primary source to the flux at 3.6 and 4.5 to be of 1.5% and 0.7% , respectively , for clumpy models , while it is constant and @xmath044% in smooth models in both bands .",
    "this would account for about 30% of the difference in the values of @xmath34 between the two dust configurations and , therefore , the remaining difference must be due to point i.    some recent works indicate that the mid - ir emission , in particular the monochromatic luminosity at 12.3 , @xmath48 , can be used as a diagnostic to distinguish between a smooth and a clumpy configuration .",
    "@xcite found that in a sample of eight seyfert galaxies ( a seyfert 1 , an 1.2 and six 1.5 or later ) , @xmath48 is tightly correlated with their x - ray @xmath49 luminosity , regardless of their type .",
    "this was interpreted as an evidence for the dust being optically thin at 12.3 , a characteristic which was reported to be typical of clumpy models , but incompatible with the smooth model of @xcite .",
    "we have checked the sets of clumpy and smooth models against this prediction , by computing the ratio of @xmath48 in type 2 over type 1 views , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l12 ] . with the exception of 7% of clumpy models that are very close to be optically thin , i.e. with @xmath50 , both sets of models always lie well below this value .",
    "overall , although the shape of the two distributions is different , we find no real evidence to the above claim .",

    "[ fig : s97type1 ] ) . but",
    "could random parameter combinations result in very similar model seds ? in order to answer this question , we introduce a measure of the dissimilarity of any two seds based on the properties discussed in the previous sections as follows :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote smooth and clumpy models , respectively , @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the fluxes at 4.6 and 24 @xmath57 m respectively .",
    "@xmath58 has been introduced to take into account the relative fluxes of the ( normalised ) models in addition to the ir spectral index , @xmath34 . comparing the value of @xmath59 for each pair of matched models ,",
    "we find that none of the pairs have a value lower than 0.1 .",
    "furthermore , we only find 6 combinations for type 1 views and 21 combinations for type 2 views with @xmath60 , with very different model parameters .",
    "we therefore conclude that there are virtually no random pairs of smooth and clumpy models in the matched grids that can produce very similar seds .",
    "within the paradigm of the agn unified scheme , the different properties of the various types of agn are attributed to the interception of the line of sight by an axisymmetric molecular dust distribution encircling the nucleus , likely in the form of a torus .",
    "direct and indirect observational evidence , such as the dichotomy of the agn population in obscured and unobscured objects , the ionization cones for the nlr , the mir bump present in the seds of all known agn attributed to emission by dust heated by the primary source , but also ir interferometry that directly resolved the inner parsec of the nucleus of the prototype seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 @xcite , all support the existence of a toroidal absorbing structure . as there is evidence favouring both a clumpy distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a smooth distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both smooth and clumpy models are still equally widely used to explain the observed seds of agn , counting both successes and shortcomings .    in this paper",
    "we compared two sets of models widely used in the literature , each representative of one of the two dust distributions , namely an updated grid of the smooth models by @xcite and the clumpy models by @xcite . in order to compare as similar models as possible and",
    "despite the intrinsic differences between the two configurations , we matched the two sets of parameters building thus restricted grids , and compared only the models within these grids .",
    "this approach has the limitation of not exploring the full parameter space for either of the two models .",
    "furthermore , and to avoid complications arising from the probabilistic nature of viewing an agn as a type 2 object through a clumpy medium , we consider two extreme inclinations i.e. edge on and face - on , for smooth models , and take as equivalent type 1 and 2 clumpy models those with a probability to see directly the central engine greater and lower than 0.5 , respectively .",
    "our findings can be summarised as follows :    * even after matching the model parameters there is not a one - to - one correspondence . for each smooth model of the restricted grid",
    "there can be several clumpy models with matched @xmath10 , @xmath7 , and @xmath14 , but different combinations of @xmath18 and @xmath61 that finally produce a given value of @xmath27 .",
    "additionally , and since we only consider the two extreme inclinations ( face - on and edge - on ) , the torus opening angle can not be matched and for each clumpy model we consider all smooth counterparts , irrespective of the value of @xmath3 . * the distribution of the various features of the ir model seds differs when smooth and clumpy dust configurations are considered .",
    "the very different behaviour of the silicate features is due more to the different chemical compositions assumed by f06 and n08 and less to the actual dust morphology .",
    "we confirm the occurrence of broader , on average , ir seds in clumpy configurations , with a larger fraction of clumpy models peaking at long wavelengths ( @xmath030 ) .",
    "the infrared spectral index , especially for type 1 views , is the quantity that changes the most between the two dust configurations , owing to the differences in the primary source assumed in the two models as well as the lack of the hotter dust component in the treatment of the clumpy medium . *",
    "our study showed no large differences in the behaviour of @xmath62 , as an indicator of how optically thin a medium is , between the two model configurations , with 5% of clumpy models showing a value very close to 1 ( i.e. optically thin configuration ) , a similar amount of clumpy and smooth models ( @xmath0 20% ) having @xmath63 and the rest of both dust configurations lying below this value . * models with matched parameters within the restricted model girds do not produce similar seds ( similar either by eye or based on the value of @xmath59 introduced in  [ sec : irsed ] ) .",
    "additionally , only a very limited number of random parameter combinations can result in seemingly identical seds , though the dust configuration differs .    from the above",
    "we conclude that , even though the two dust models produce distinct seds , most of the differences arise from the model assumptions ( e.g. primary source , dust chemical composition ) and not from the dust morphology ( smooth or clumpy ) . to summarise , the properties of dust in agn as measured by matching observations ( be it broad band ir photometry or ir spectra ) with models will strongly depend on the choice of the dust distribution .",
    "the possibility to discriminate between a smooth and a clumpy medium based on the various sed features may exist , but ambiguities are more common than not .",
    "independent estimates of physical parameters , such as the optical depth , the size of the torus or the mass of the gas are needed in order to further constrain the models .",
    "x - ray observations could , for instance , provide an _",
    "upper limit _ of the optical depth , integrated along the line of sight , high resolution hi maps of known nearby agn could put constraints on the gas content within the circumnuclear region .",
    "eventually , alma will permit to indirectly determine the morphology of the obscuring material by allowing the comparison between the mid - ir and sub - mm emission of the structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) or even to directly resolve the obscuring torus , making use of its very high angular resolution ( sub - pc scale at the distances of nearby agn at high frequencies ) .",
    "this work makes use of the @xcite models : http://www.pa.uky.edu / clumpy/. a.f . would like to thank robert nikutta and moshe elitzur for providing detailed explanation on their models and on the calculation of the output parameters , as well as hagai netzer for very useful comments .",
    "we also thank r. nikutta for his details and insightful referee report , that improved a lot the content and quality of our work .",
