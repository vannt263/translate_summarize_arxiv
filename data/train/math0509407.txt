    "graphical enumeration arises in a variety of contexts in combinatorics @xcite , and naturally so in the realm of combinatorial objects with interesting topological properties @xcite .",
    "we provide a new classification of genus one circle trees and address a question raised by hough @xcite about their number .",
    "our study is motivated by numerous results in the study of partitions and trees of a certain genus , as well as results about the genuses of maps and hypermaps , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the following two definitions are discussed in @xcite in great detail ; we shall use the definition of a labeled circle tree throughout the paper , whereas we shall mostly use an alternate , less technical definition for the genus of a circle tree .    a * labeled circle tree * ( * l - c - tree * ) on @xmath0 points is a tree with its @xmath0 vertices labeled 1 through n on a circle in a counterclockwise direction and its edges drawn as straight lines within the circle .",
    "the * genus * g * of a l - c - tree @xmath2 * on @xmath0 points is defined to be @xmath31+@xmath4(n-1-@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the matching of the given l - c - tree @xmath2 , @xmath7(1 2 3 4 @xmath8 n ) , and the function @xmath9 gives the number of cycles of its argument ; @xmath10 is the inverse permutation of @xmath6 , and the multiplication of two permutations is from right to left .",
    "the genus of a l - c - tree can also be described as the genus of the surface with minimal genus such that the tree together with the circle it is drawn on can be drawn on the surface without crossing edges .",
    "in particular , a genus one l - c - tree is such that the tree together with the circle it is drawn on can be embedded in a surface of genus one , but not of genus zero .",
    "hough @xcite observed that the number of genus one labeled circle trees on @xmath0 points ( denoted by * _",
    "f(n ) _ * ) is divisible by @xmath0 for small values of @xmath0 , and hypothesized the same for all integers @xmath11 . using our classification of all genus one labeled circle trees , we prove that either @xmath12 is divisible by @xmath0 , or it is divisible by @xmath13 ; moreover , we explicitly describe when each of these possibilities occur .",
    "in section 2 we discuss the necessary definitions and review a result of marcus @xcite , which implies that deleting an uncrossed edge from a l - c - tree or deleting all but one of several parallel edges leads to one of two canonical reduced forms of circle trees if and only if the l - c - tree was genus one .",
    "although marcus result @xcite is formulated for partitions , it easily translates to l - c - trees .",
    "since the labeling of the l - c - tree is irrelevant for the deletion of edges mentioned above , we introduce the concept of an * _ unlabeled circle tree _ * to which marcus result still applies . for understanding the interrelation between the number of genus one l - c - trees and genus one u - c - trees we explore the basic properties of u - c - trees in section 3 .",
    "we introduce a special - structured subgraph , called an * _ edgelike - graph _ * , in section 4 , and we describe an * _ e - reduction process _ * in section 5 .",
    "based on the e - reduction process we give a * _ classification _ * of genus one c - trees by nineteen * _ reduced forms _ * in section 6 .",
    "we clarify the connection between the number of l - c - trees and u - c - trees on @xmath0 points in the further sections , analyzing reduced forms . finally , using our previous results",
    "we formulate the theorem about @xmath12 s divisibility by @xmath0 or @xmath13 .",
    "the definition of a labeled circle tree straighforwardly extends to the definition of a * _ labeled circle graph_*. indeed , replacing the word tree with graph in the definition of l - c - tree gives the desired definition of a l - c - graph .",
    "two * _ l - c - graphs _ * @xmath14 and @xmath15 are said to be * _ isomorphic _ * if an edge @xmath16 with endpoints labeled @xmath17 and @xmath18 is in @xmath14 if and only if there is an edge @xmath19 in @xmath15 with endpoints @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( we consider graphs without multiple edges ) . furthermore",
    ", if a vertex labeled @xmath20 is of degree zero in one of the graphs then it is of degree zero in both of them .",
    "an * _ unlableled circle graph _ * ( * _ u - c - graph _ * ) is a graph obtained by deletion of labels of a l - c - graph .",
    "two * _ u - c - graphs _ * are said to be * _ isomorphic _ * if it is possible to label their vertices so that the obtained l - c - graphs are isomorphic .",
    "it follows from the definition of genus that isomorphic l - c - trees have equal genuses .",
    "we conveniently define the * _ genus of a u - c - tree _ * @xmath2 on @xmath0 points to be the genus of any of the l - c - trees one obtains by labeling the vertices of @xmath2 by _ 1 _ through @xmath0 in a counterclockwise direction .",
    "call u - c - graphs ( u - c - trees ) and l - c - graphs ( l - c - trees ) by the common name * _ c - graphs _ * ( * _ c - trees _ * ) . *",
    "_ edges _ * @xmath16 and @xmath19 of a c - graph * _ cross _ * if they have a point in common on the drawing of the c - graph other than their endpoints .",
    "* _ edges _ * @xmath16 and @xmath19 of a c - graph @xmath21 are * _ parallel _ * if they cross the same edges of @xmath21 , respectively . that the relation ` parallel ' is an equivalence relation is a straightforward check of reflexivity , symmetry and transitivity .",
    "an * u - c - tree * c and a * l - c - tree * t are said to * correspond * if the u - c - tree obtained by the deletion of the labels of t is isomorphic to c.    by the definition of genus the genuses of corresponding u - c - trees and l - c - trees are equal .",
    "note that a u - c - tree @xmath22 on @xmath0 points can correspond to at most @xmath0 non - isomorphic l - c - trees . in some cases the u - c - tree corresponds to exactly @xmath0 non - isomorphic l - c - trees , but in some cases a u - c - tree corresponds to less then @xmath0 non - isomorphic l - c - trees , figure 2.1 .    the reinterpretation of marcus result [ 3 , 4 ] :    performing the following two operations on a c - tree as many times as possible :    \\1 ) deleting an edge from the c - tree , which is not crossed by any other edge    \\2 ) deleting all but one of several parallel edges    leads to form 1 or form 2 shown on figure 2.2 if and only if the c - tree was genus one .",
    "[ p1 ]    we refer to the two operations of proposition 1 as operation 1 ) and operation 2 ) .",
    "call the u - c - graphs obtained from a u - c - tree c by executing operations 1 ) and 2 ) * offsprings*. a u - c - tree @xmath22 * descends * to a u - c - graph , if the u - c - graph is an offspring of @xmath22 .",
    "the * final offspring * of a u - c - tree c is the offspring which has no edges which could be deleted by the execution of operations 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "( some offsprings of a u - c - tree are represented on figure 2.3 )    in section 3 we conclude that the final offspring of a genus one u - c - tree c is unique ( up to isomorphism ) .",
    "we now rephrase proposition 1 :    @xmath23 @xmath24 _ the genus of a u - c - tree t is one if and only if its final offspring is form 1 or form 2 . _    naturally , by saying that the final offspring is form 1 or form 2 , we mean that the final offspring is isomorphic either to form 1 or to form 2",
    ". we do not stress this in the future , since it is clear from the context .",
    "we can now reformulate the question about the divisibility of @xmath12 by @xmath0 or @xmath13 as follows : when is the number of l - c - trees on @xmath0 points , which have corresponding u - c - trees that descend to form 1 or form 2 ( figure 2.2 ) by the execution of operations 1 ) and 2 ) ( these are all of the genus one l - c - trees ) , divisible by @xmath0 and when is it divisible just by @xmath13 and not by @xmath0 ?",
    "we state two simple lemmas concerning u - c - trees without proof .",
    "the proofs are based on the definitions of uncrossed and parallel edges , and are easily derived by contracition .",
    "if an edge is uncrossed after a number of operations 1 ) and 2 ) are executed on a u - c - tree , then that edge is uncrossed in the u - c - tree , as well as in all its offsprings ( if not deleted ) .",
    "if two edges are parallel after a number of operations 1 ) and 2 ) are executed on a u - c - tree , then those two edges are parallel in the u - c - tree , as well as in all its offsprings ( if not deleted ) .    from lemma 1 and lemma 2",
    "we conclude that the order of the execution of operations 1 ) and 2 ) and the particular choice of the order of the edges to be deleted do not affect the final offspring . by proposition 1 , after executing operations 1 ) and 2 ) on a u - c - tree until applicable , form 1 or form 2 are obtained if and only if the u - c - tree was genus one .",
    "thus , it is possible to construct every genus one u - c - tree by beginning from form 1 or form 2 and by adding parallel edges to the ones presented in the form , and by adding uncrossed edges .",
    "moreover , starting with these two forms and adding only parallel and uncrossed edges any u - c - tree obtained is of genus one .",
    "see figure 3.1 for illustration .",
    "this `` building '' idea might serve as a basis for obtaining the exact number of genus one l - c - trees on @xmath0 points .",
    "in this section we introduce a main concept of our work , that of an * _ edgelike - graph_*. as the name already suggests , these graphs behave somewhat like edges .",
    "indeed , edgelike - graphs , or e - graphs for short , are subtrees of a given u - c - tree with the special property that collapsing an e - graph to an edge ( a specified one ) the obtained u - c - tree has the same genus as the one we began with .",
    "once the concept of e - graph is grasped , the way operations 1 ) and 2 ) act on a c - tree becomes easy to visualize and understand .",
    "a u - c - tree can be decomposed into e - graphs , in which case operations 1 ) and 2 ) act within these decomposed structures .",
    "the previous fact exhibits the correlation between the structure of a c - graph and operations 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "let edges @xmath25 be parallel .",
    "if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the outermost edges among @xmath28 , for all @xmath29 , then edges @xmath25 are * _ increasingly parallel_*. edges @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are increasingly parallel on figure 4.1 .",

    "we also make the convention that arc @xmath40 is the arc between points @xmath41 and @xmath42 when going in a counterclockwise direction from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .    given a c - graph @xmath21 take any crossed edge @xmath43 of it .",
    "let increasingly parallel edges @xmath25 be all edges of @xmath21 parallel to @xmath43 ( including @xmath43 itself ) .",

    "if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then the edges of @xmath21 such that both of their endpoints are on arcs @xmath53 and @xmath54 and they are uncrossed or parallel to @xmath43 constitute the edgelike - graph , or e - graph , of @xmath21 containing @xmath43 . figure 4.1 .",
    "observe that there is a unique e - graph containing each crossed edge .",
    "let the arcs @xmath53 and @xmath54 as in the above definition be called the arcs of an e - graph , whereas edges @xmath30 and @xmath55 the outermost edges of it . also , call the set of crossed edges of the e - graph the set of parallel edges of the e - graph and call the set of edges of the e - graph that are uncrossed the set of uncrossed edges .    using the notation of definition 5 , edges @xmath44 are all of the edges parallel to @xmath43 having both of their endpoints on arcs @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
