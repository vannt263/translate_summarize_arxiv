    "the bohr - van leeuwen ( bvl ) theorem on the absence of classical orbital diamagnetism in theromodynamic equilibrium has been a surprise of theoretical physics [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "this bvl null result is statistical - mechanically exact .",
    "it is , however , counter - intuitive inasmuch as a charged particle orbiting classically under the lorentz force exerted by an externally applied magnetic field is equivalent to an amperean current loop in the interior of the sample , and hence to a non - zero orbital magnetic moment .",
    "moreover , the orbital moment is expected to be diamagnetic following the lenz s law .",
    "a physically appealing resolution was advanced by bohr [ 2 ] suggesting an exact cancellation , on the average , of the diamagnetic orbital magnetic moment in the interior of the sample by the paramagnetic moment subtended by the particle skipping the boundary in the opposite ( paramagnetic ) sense @xmath0 the edge current [ 3 ] .",
    "more recently [ 4 ] , the role of the boundary was treated explicitly through a solution of the fokker - planck equation associated with the classical langevin dynamics of the charged particle in a finite but unbounded space , namely the surface of a sphere ( recall that , strictly speaking , a boundary has no boundary ) .",
    "again , the orbital magnetic moment turned out to be zero . in our recent work [ 5,6 ]",
    "we have , therefore , re - examined the bvl null result .",
    "our analyses strongly suggest that the vanishing of the classical orbital diamagnetism is a direct consequence of detailed - balance ( the microscopic reversibility ) , namely that there are _ no cycles _ in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "now , the detailed balance is , of course , conditioned mathematically by the second fluctuation - dissipation ( ii - fd ) theorem of kubo [ 7 ] . in terms of the classical langevin equation governing the stochastic dissipative dynamics that underlies equilibrium statistical mechanics , the f - d relation requires the driving noise to be markovian .",
    "indeed , it has been shown [ 8 ] that a markovian non - equilibrium steady state can always be transformed to an equivalent thermodynamic state in equilibrium .",
    "it is our conjecture , therefore , that a stochastic dissipative system driven by a non - markovian noise may have in general a non - equilibrium steady state with finite orbital magnetic moment @xmath0 without conflicting with the bvl theorem for thermodynamic equilibrium . in what follows ,",
    "we have addressed this issue through a detailed numerical simulation of the relevant stochastic dissipative dynamics involved .",
    "the results of our simulation support our conjecture , namely that the orbital magnetic moment is indeed finite for the non - markovian case .",
    "there is , however , a new surprise now , namely that the sign of the magnetic moment turns out to be paramagnetic !",
    "morever , for a classical gas of such charged particles with paramagnetic orbital moment , the inherently positive feedback may lead to an enhanced magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 possibly even to a spontaneous ordering of the classical orbital magnetic moments .",
    "consider the stochastic - dissipative classical dynamics of a charged particle ( charge = @xmath1 ) and mass @xmath2 in the xy - plane in the presence of a uniform magnetic field of magnitude @xmath3 directed along the positive z - axis .",
    "let the particle be confined harmonically in the xy - plane .",
    "( in this simple model , the motion along the z - axis factors out ) . harder confinement ( reflecting wall ) will be introduced later .",
    "the equation of motion can now be written down straightforwardly in the polar co - ordinate system as @xmath4 @xmath5 where , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the kubo - anderson - type noise terms [ 9 ] . the k - a noise , as depicted schematically in fig.1 , is best described as a sequence of random rectangular pulses of equal pulse - width @xmath8 .",
    "the pulse heights are , however , identically , independently distributed gaussian random variates , of mean zero and finite variance .",
    "it is to be emphasized that @xmath8 here is not necessarily a small quantity in any sense @xmath0 it is to be regarded as a physical input parameter that makes the noise tunably non - markovian .",
    "the numerical simulation , however , must cover these not necessarily small time intervals @xmath8 with much finer sub - divisions @xmath9 so as to ensure high numerical accuracy in treating the systematic parts of the driving forces present in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . more specifically , in our numerical simulation the number of finer time - step subdivisions has been taken to be @xmath10 ( figures 1 - 4 ) .",
    "moreover , the time of integration has been kept long ( @xmath11 sub - steps ) in all these cases .",
    "it is convenient to define here the parameters @xmath12 @xmath13 confining harmonic frequency = @xmath14 , @xmath15 = the cyclotron frequency @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , the stokes friction .",
    "also , we write that @xmath18 , and similary for @xmath19 . note that @xmath20 has the dimension of length , while @xmath21 are dimensionless .",
    "further , we introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 the dimensionless radial coordinate . with these re - definitions , the equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can now be re - written in the fully dimensionless form as @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . here",
    "the overhead dot denotes derivative with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath30 . also , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are uncorrelated gaussian variates with mean zero and variance unity .    the steady - state orbital magnetic moment @xmath33",
    "can now be written as @xmath34 giving the dimensionless orbital magnetic moment @xmath35 here the double angle bracket denotes averaging over an ensemble of realizations of the random noise as well as over time in the long - time limit .",
    "we identify @xmath36 with the steady - state value of the dimensionless orbital magnetic moment .    in figure 2",
    "we have plotted the dimensionless magnetic moment @xmath36 against the pulse - width @xmath37 , for some chosen values of the magnetic field , measured in terms of the dimensionless cyclotron frequency @xmath38 .",
    "the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath20 have been set equal to unity .    in figure 3 , we have repeated , for the sake of comparison , the plot in figure 2 , but now for the case of a hard confinement .",
    "the latter is realized by modifying the soft , harmonic restoring force term @xmath40 in the radial equation ( 1 ) to @xmath41 , and choosing a large integer exponent @xmath42 .",
    "the length parameter @xmath43 here denotes the radial position of the effectively reflecting wall . with this",
    ", the term @xmath44 in equation ( 3 ) becomes @xmath45 , with @xmath46 . in figure 3",
    "we have chosen n=20 , and @xmath47 .",
    "( note that the limit @xmath48 corresponds to the soft ( harmonic ) confining potential ) .    finally , for completeness , in fig.4 we have repeated the plot ( of @xmath36 against @xmath37 ) for the case of no confining potential , i.e. , for @xmath49 , with the other parameters remaining the same .",
    "through our numerical simulation of a classical model for the stochastic - dissipative dynamics of a charged particle , moving in a magnetic field and driven by a non - markovian noise , we have demonstrated the appearance of an induced orbital magnetic moment in the steady state .",
    "most significantly , the orbital moment turns out to be _ paramagnetic _ !",
    "the appearance of a non - zero classical orbital magnetic moment in the non - equilibrium steady state implies deviation of the dynamical system from the second fluctuation - dissipation ( ii - fd ) relation .",
    "the latter would have otherwise enforced a detailed - balance ( meaning _ no cycles _ ) , and hence no induced orbital magnetic moment .",
    "the moment , of course , vanishes in the limit of delta - correlated white noise ( @xmath50 @xmath51 , with the product @xmath52 finite ) that renders the system ii - fd theorem compliant .",
    "the essential point to be emphasized here is the non - markovian nature of the driving noise used in the stochastic model .",
    "this point is consistent with the proven result of prost et al .",
    "[ 9 ] that for a markovian dynamics , the non - equilibrium steady state can always be transformed into an effectively equilibrium state .",
    "it may be noted that our results hold for a soft ( harmonic ) potential confinement as well as for a hard ( reflecting wall type ) potential confinement . also , the magnitude of the orbital paramagnetic moment is non - monotonic in the externally applied magnetic - field strength @xmath0 initially increasing with increasing magnetic field strength and then decreasing in the high - field regime .",
    "further , the magnetic moment scales as the variance of the random pulse - height for a given pulse width in the case of harmonic confinement ( see eq .",
    "5 ) . in the case of the hard confinement",
    ", however , there is no simple scaling , but the qualitative behaviour remains the same .    for the sake of completeness , we also carried out a similar simulation for the case of no potential - confinement , @xmath50 with @xmath53 .",
    "interestingly , but not surprisingly though , we obtained as in figure 4 a steady - state orbital magnetic moment which has the opposite sign @xmath0 it is diamagnetic !",
    "this is , however , consistent with the physical picture of bohr [ 1 - 3 ] : without the confinement , there are naturally no orbits skipping the boundary , i.e. , no edge current , which would have sub - tended a paramagnetic moment leading to the cancellation .",
    "we are thus left only with the maxwell cycles well within the interior that constitute the amperean current loops giving the diamagnetic moment ( the lenz s law ) .",
    "this avoided cancellation was seen also in the analytical solution for the simple case of a markovian ( delta - correlated ) noise [ 10 ] .",
    "this now turns out to be true even for the non - markovian case as shown in our simulation .",
    "the overall picture is one in which the particle , initially at the origin , say , diffuses outwards on the average , but the orbital diamagnetic moment reaches its steady - state value on a relatively short time scale which is determined by the parameters appearing in equations ( 1,2 ) .",
    "the outward diffusion simply spreads out the total orbital magnetic moment ( @xmath54 ) over the ever increasing area covered , but without changing its time - averaged value @xmath0 the steady - state diamagnetic moment .",
    "the paramagnetic sign of the induced orbital magnetic moment can have interesting consequences of considerable physical significance .",
    "after all , the paramagnetic sign of the moment inherently signifies a positive feed - back effect when we consider not just one but a system of many charged particles . here , the mean self - field can in principle lead to a spontaneous macroscopic orbital magnetic moment .    as for a possible experimental realization of such a confined system , we begin by noting that what is really essential for obtaining the classical orbital paramagnetism in a non - equilibrium _ steady state _ is the non - markovian nature of the stochastic forcing .",
    "thus , a micron - sized sample of a semi - metal ( such as bismuth ) trapped in an optical tweezer , and irradiated with random laser pulses in the presence of an external magnetic field would constitute a possible candidate system .",
    "the laser impulses should impart high enough kinetic energy ( high nominal temperature ) so as to create a non - degenerate ( classical ) gas of charged particles ( electrons and holes ) .",
    "then , the high temperature washes out the quantum signature , i.e. , the discrete quantum level - spacings in the micron - sized sample , leaving behind a classical charged particle system .",
    "( recall that the orbital magnetic moment does not depend on the sign of the charge on the particle , e.g. , be it an electron or a hole ) .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect the total induced orbital magnetic moment to scale up with the number of charged particles in the confined system .",
    "this mechanism may even generate spontaneously a macroscopic magnetic meanfield @xmath0 such as the _ seed _ field of interest in the astrophysical context .",
