    "the system is kinetically arrested and displays non - ergodic features such as ultraslow relaxations , aging , and dynamical heterogeneities @xcite .",
    "these glassy - like features have raised the issue of unifying the behaviour of colloidal gels and that of more concentrated amorphous jammed systems , e.g. colloidal glasses or concentrated emulsions @xcite .",
    "therefore , most recent works on systems of short - range attractive particles have focused on the physics of gelation and on their structural properties at rest @xcite .    of even greater practical importance",
    "is the behaviour of such materials under external stress . it is well known that applying stress to a soft glassy material generally triggers a solid - to - fluid transition , in the same way as increasing the temperature @xmath0 , lowering the interparticle attractive energy @xmath1 , or lowering the particle volume fraction @xmath2 @xcite . in particular , the yielding phenomenon , i.e. the fact that the material flows like a liquid above a yield stress @xmath3 and remains solid below @xmath3 , has been extensively documented in colloidal gels and glasses through standard rheological measurements and theoretical or numerical models , with emphasis on the scaling of viscoelastic properties and of @xmath3 with @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , rheology provides information that are averaged over the whole sample size and it can not capture local phenomena such as apparent wall slip @xcite , shear localization @xcite , or fracture within the material @xcite .",
    "recently , a few original experimental approaches have been reported using confocal microscopy @xcite and particle imaging velocimetry in microchannels @xcite .",
    "still , these works were restricted to steady - state measurements , and , as a matter of fact , very little is known on how the stress - induced solid - to - fluid transition exactly proceeds in both space and time .    in the present article ,",
    "we introduce high - frequency ultrasound as a new tool to follow the local deformation and flow of carbon black suspensions , a totally opaque colloidal gel made of weakly attractive soot particles . both creep tests and oscillatory shear experiments show for the first time that , above a critical yield stress @xmath3 , ( i ) yielding proceeds from the cell walls in a spatially and temporally heterogeneous way and ( ii ) the time needed for total fluidization of the sample decreases exponentially with the applied shear stress .",
    "these results point out the existence of an energy barrier that linearly decreases with the external stress .",
    "therefore , they provide evidence for the relevance of activated barrier hopping and for processes reminiscent of heterogeneous nucleation , in strong support of recent models @xcite .",

    "all measurements are carried out by first preshearing the suspension at 1000  s@xmath8 then at @xmath9  s@xmath8 for 20  s each , in order to break up any large aggregate .",
    "the sample is then left at rest for 100  s during which the gel structure reforms , a process that is controlled by monitoring the viscoelastic moduli @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath12  hz and @xmath13  pa . a rest time of 100  s is sufficient for @xmath10 and @xmath11 to reach a steady state with negligible aging ( fig .",

    "data analysis is then straightforward : if two successive speckle signals are fully correlated , then the gel is solid - like since it comes back exactly to the same position every period ( fig .  [ fig5]d ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we interpret any significant degree of decorrelation in the speckle signal from one period to the other as the signature of fluid - like behaviour due to motions of the scatterers induced by local rearrangements inside the gel ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]f ) .",
    "note that such decorrelation in the fluidized state does not arise from flow irreversibility ( since the reynolds number is @xmath25 ) but rather from sedimentation of carbon black clusters due to the density mismatch between the mineral oil and the carbon black particles .",

    "the spatiotemporal tracking of the transition from correlated speckle signals ( i.e. solid - like state ) to decorrelated speckle signals ( i.e. fluidized state ) is made quantitative by using a threshold for the correlation coefficient of successive signals over small time windows , thus identifying the boundary between solid and fluid regions as a function of time up to a spatial resolution of 40  @xmath6 m",
