    "two hall - probes are positioned immediately under the teflon@xmath172 dish",
    ". a siemens hall - probe ( ksy 13 ) serves to measure the magnetic field during its jump  like increase , and is connected to the digital voltmeter ( prema 6001 ) . for measuring a constant magnetic field and for calibration purpose",
    "we use a commercial hall - probe ( group3-lpt-231 ) connected to the digital teslameter ( dtm 141 ) .",
    "both devices are controlled via ieee - bus by the computer .",
    "next we give a characteristic example for the evolution of the surface pattern during a jump  like increase of the magnetic field .",
    "[ evolution](a ) shows circular surface deformations taken @xmath183 after the start of the experiment .",
    "this surface deformations are first created at the edge of the dish , because of the discontinuity of the magnetic induction induced by the finite size of the container .",
    "the circular deformation is fixed in space , and its amplitude grows during the jump  like increase of the magnetic field . with increasing time more circular",

    "[ evolution](b ) . after this transient concentric arrangement",
    "a hexagonal pattern of rosensweig peaks evolves ( see fig .",
    "[ evolution](c ) ) .",
    "the theoretical results stem from a linear theory which can determine correctly the critical values of the pattern selected by the instability only at the threshold . above the threshold ,",
    "a band of wave numbers will become unstable , where the mode with the largest growth rate is the most unstable linear mode of the flat interface .",
    "due to nonlinear effects the final stable pattern does not generally correspond to the most unstable linear mode , as shown here and in other experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore it has to be stressed that for the comparison with the linear theory not the stable hexagonal pattern , but the most early stage of the pattern , namely the transient circular deformations are most appropriate .",
    "the wave number of the circular deformations is extracted from the pictures in the following way .",
    "first the algorithm scans the diagonals of the picture for the local maximum of the grey levels .",
    "starting at the corners of the pictures , it detects points which are situated at the edge of the teflon@xmath172 dish .",

    "[ pic_proc](a ) . in order to control the precision of the algorithm a white circle with the proper radius of the dish",
    "is constructed around the detected center . in the next step",
    "we calculate the radial distribution of the grey values for all pixels within the circumference of the dish , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pic_proc](b ) . for comparison fig .",
    "[ pic_proc](c ) gives an artificial two dimensional representation of the grey value distribution .    in all of the three pictures of fig .",
    "[ pic_proc ] one can easily discriminate three zones . in the innermost zone only small surface undulations exist , which give rise to the unstructured part of the grey value distribution in fig .",
    "[ pic_proc](b , c ) . for larger radii",
    "one finds the area of circular surface deformations which generates the bi  periodic peak pattern in the distribution .",
    "the large peaks are correlated with the deformation troughs and the small peaks with the deformation crests .",
    "finally the outermost zone includes the edge of the dish together with the first , edge induced , deformation crest . for estimation of the wave number",
    "we discard the inner- and outermost zones .",
    "the top part of the peaks in the remaining zone is fitted by a polynomial of second order .",
    "the average distance of their maxima gives the half of the desired wavelength .",
    "for the rather small number of deformations available , the above presented method of wave number calculation turned out to be more stable and to give more precise results than the competing method of two dimensional fourier transformation . together with the picture",
    "the momentarily magnetic induction has been recorded during the jump  like increase .",
    "this allows an exact relation of the extracted wave number to the instantly prevailing magnetic induction .",
    "let us now focus on the experimental results displayed in fig .",
    "[ ex_vs_th ] , where the wave number @xmath138 is plotted versus the magnetic induction @xmath29 .",
    "each open square denotes the wave number extracted from a picture taken during a jump  like increase of the magnetic field to @xmath184 .",
    "the estimated maximal errors for @xmath138 of @xmath185 and for @xmath29 of @xmath186 are not plotted for the purpose of clarity .",
    "the dashed line displays the theoretical results for the listed material parameters of the magnetic fluid emg  909 . using @xmath16 as a fit ",
    "parameter gives the solid line with @xmath187 .",
    "the fitted value for @xmath16 differs by @xmath188 from the value given by ferrofluidics , a deviation which is well within the tolerance of production specified by ferrofluidics .",
    "obviously there is a rather good agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical graph for @xmath187 marked by the solid line .",
    "the _ linear _ increase in the appearing wave number , both in experiment and in theory , is our main outcome .    comparing the two theoretical curves in fig .",
    "[ ex_vs_th ] , an increase of @xmath16 results in a decrease of the critical magnetic induction , whereas the critical wave number remains constant , as can bee seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] , [ eq:16 ] , [ eq:17 ] ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) a constant critical wave number implies that the density and the surface tension are constant .",
    "therefore we refrain to consider them as additional fit parameters .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] changes in the viscosity by an order of magnitude are necessary to cause a relevant influence on the behaviour of wave number of maximal growth on the induction .",
    "therefore changes in the viscosity due to small thermal fluctuations in the experiment can be neglected .",
    "we find a linear wave number dependence of the circular surface deformations .",
    "this pattern is a more simple realization of the normal field instability than the familiar hexagonal pattern of rosensweig cusps .",
    "the latter one is obtained by a symmetrical superposition of _ three _ patterns of parallel stripes with the wave vectors separated by 120 degree @xcite .",
    "obviously the circular surface deformations can be regarded as a stripe pattern favoured by the symmetry of the dish . as a consequence",
    "they appear first , before nonlinear interactions select in a later stage the hexagonal pattern .",
    "this situation is well known from rayleigh - benard convection in cylindrical containers , where , due to side - wall induced convection , concentric target patterns appear instead of hexagonal structures .",
    "our observations agree in part with recent findings by browaeys et al .",
    "they detected circular surface deformations for a constant , subcritical magnetic field of @xmath189 .",
    "in contrast to their experiment , we do not perform a periodic modulation , but a jump  like increase of the magnetic induction .",
    "thus we have no interference with additional waves propagating onto the circular deformations .",
    "therefore a measurement of the wave number , as described above , could be realized .",
    "the circular surface deformations have to be distinguished from circular , meniscus induced surface waves emitted from the edge of lateral cell walls  @xcite . here , the circular deformations are induced by the discontinuity of the magnetic induction at the edge of the container .",
    "the formation of a meniscus is eluded by a brimful filling of the dish and by the design of the vessel which has a slope with respect to the horizontal of @xmath190 , the contact angle between the magnetic fluid and teflon@xmath172 .",
    "finite size effects due to the finite size of the vessel are rather small in the experiment . applying the arguments of edwards and fauve @xcite , the width of the band of unstable wave numbers , @xmath191 @xmath192 for @xmath193 and @xmath194 mm , is much larger than @xmath195 @xmath192 , the wave number separation between the quantized modes of the vessel .",
    "thus the influence of the vessel size can be neglected and the developing pattern is insensitive to the vessel size .    for the experiments we have chosen a magnetic fluid with a rather low value of magnetic permeability @xmath196 , in order to keep hysteresis effects small . indeed , with our resolution a hysteresis can not be detected .",
    "hysteresis strength proves to increase monotonically with the permeability of the magnetic fluid @xcite .",
    "thus , the influence of higher permeability on the wave number of maximal growth remains to be investigated experimentally in the context of a more complex situation of a transition with large hysteresis .",
    "by means of the polar representation of the complex frequency @xmath43 the dispersion relation for surface waves on viscous magnetic fluids is split into a real and an imaginary part .",
    "the parameters are determined for which pure imaginary solutions @xmath133 and @xmath134 for both parts exist . for these parameters",
    "the originally horizontal surface is unstable , because initially small undulations of the surface , proportional to @xmath197 , grow exponentially .",
    "the imaginary part of the dispersion relation is fulfilled mostly automatically . from the real part , the wave number with maximal growth rate @xmath3 and the maximal growth rate @xmath140 itself can be easily determined .",
    "it can be done for any combination of material parameters and for any thickness of the layer .",
    "this is the strength of the presented analytical method which covers the entire parameter space between the previously studied asymptotic cases @xcite .",
    "it therefore allows to study the transition from one limit to the other .",
    "such a transition is exemplarily illustrated for an infinitely thick layer with viscosities varying between zero and infinity .",
    "for magnetic fluids of infinite depth it is shown that earlier qualitative observations of constant wave numbers above the critical magnetic field @xcite can not be explained by the result of an asymptotic analysis @xcite . the analysis in @xcite",
    "does not cover the features of the experimental fluids . in order to apply a theory , where the field is instantly present , a jump  like increase of the field in the experiments is essential",
    ". therefore the results for a continuously increased field @xcite are inappropriate for a comparison with such a theory .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that the transient pattern is the most suitable one to be compared to the linear theory .",
    "taking all these into account , we are able to observe a linear increase of the wave number of maximal growth with increasing magnetic induction . this linear increase is quantitatively confirmed by the linear theory .    an increasing wave number with increasing field",
    "was also observed in the corresponding electrical setup where a liquid metal is subjected to a normal electric field @xcite , but this result is based only on a qualitative observation .",
    "the authors emphasize as well the importance of a fast build up of the field .",
    "it is very attractive to test in further experiments whether the predicted generic behaviour of the maximal growth rate can be confirmed in the weakly nonlinear regime . as an expected outcome",
    ", @xmath198 should start to grow like a square root with increasing supercritical induction .",
    "furthermore , it remains to be seen whether the linear increase of the wave number of the linearly most unstable pattern lasts in the final hexagonal pattern .",
    "a confirmation would mean that also the wave number of the final pattern varies if the induction is _ jump - like _ increased .",
    "we point out , that for a _ continuous _ increase of the induction the behaviour of the wave number for both the transient and the final pattern remains to be elucidated .",

    "<S> these results are quantitatively compared to the wave number of the transient pattern observed experimentally after a jump  like increase of the field . </S>",
    "<S> the wave number grows linearly with increasing induction where the theoretical and the experimental data agree well . thereby a long - standing controversy about the behaviour of the wave number above the critical magnetic field is tackled . </S>"
