    "kloe  @xcite operates at  @xcite , an @xmath20 collider also known as the frascati @xmath2 factory ; @xmath2 mesons are produced in small angle ( 25 mrad ) collisions of equal energy electrons and positrons , giving the @xmath2 a small transverse momentum component in the horizontal plane , @xmath21 the main advantage of studying kaons at a @xmath2 factory is that @xmath2 mesons decay @xmath22 of the time into charged kaons and @xmath23 of the time into neutral kaons .",
    "s and s ( or s and s ) are produced almost back - to - back in the laboratory , with mean decay paths @xmath24 cm , @xmath25 cm , and @xmath26 cm , respectively .",
    "one of the features of a @xmath2 factory is the the possibility to perform tagged measurements : the detection of a long - lived neutral kaon  guarantees the presence of a  of given momentum and direction and vice versa .",
    "the same holds for charged kaons .    to    the kloe detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kloesec ] ) consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter . a superconducting coil outside",
    "the calorimeter provides a 0.52 t  field .",
    "the drift chamber  @xcite , 4 m  in diameter and 3.3 m  long , has 12582 all - stereo sense wires and 37746 aluminium field wires .",
    "the chamber shell is made of carbon fiber - epoxy composite and the gas used is a 90% helium , 10% isobutane mixture .",
    "these features maximize transparency to photons and reduce @xmath27  regeneration .",
    "the position resolutions are @xmath28 and @xmath29 the momentum resolution is @xmath30 .",
    "vertices are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "the calorimeter  @xcite is divided into a barrel and two endcaps and covers 98% of the solid angle .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath32 and the timing resolution is @xmath33 the trigger  @xcite uses calorimeter and chamber information . for the work described here ,",
    "the trigger relies entirely on calorimeter information .",
    "two local energy deposits above threshold ( @xmath34me-.07em v  on the barrel , @xmath35me-.07em v  on the endcaps ) are required .",
    "the trigger time has a large spread with respect to the bunch crossing time .",
    "however , it is synchronized with the machine rf divided by 4 , @xmath36 , with an accuracy of 50ps . .",
    "the time @xmath37  of the bunch crossing producing an event is determined after event reconstruction .",
    "during 2002 data taking   reached a peak luminosity of @xmath38 . since the start of data taking , we have collected an integrated luminosity of @xmath3@xmath4 ; considering only the @xmath39@xmath4  of data passing all quality cuts , with particular reference to machine - background conditions , and using a @xmath2 cross - section of @xmath40b , we can estimate that our data set contains @xmath41 pairs and @xmath42 pairs . therefore , for @xmath8 , taking selection efficiencies into account , we estimate that we have about a million events for each of the semileptonic channels , which translates into a statistical error of @xmath4310@xmath44 on the branching ratio measurements .",
    "moreover , these data give a statistical contribution to the absolute error on the slope of @xmath10  of @xmath4310@xmath45 for both neutral and charged kaons ; we note here that @xmath12 must be measured with an absolute error of @xmath4310@xmath44 to reach a 1% relative precision on the theoretical determination of @xmath46  @xcite",
    ". two peculiar characteristics of kloe , are the tagging technique and the good resolution on kaon momentum .",
    "the tagging allows us to select clean kaon beams of  or of , and to measure absolute branching ratios .",
    "thus the strategy for the selection of @xmath47 decays is to tag using one kaon of the pair , and to look for the desired semileptonic decay of the other .",
    "the very clean signature of the decays  and  is exploited to tag charged kaons  ( fig.[fig : tagkpm ] , left ) ; only drift chamber information is used to select these decays , so that the tagging efficiencies for different decays of tagged particle can be estimated directly from data , using the additional calorimetric information .",
    "to    for neutral kaons , we use the  decays to tag the , while the sample of  interacting in the calorimeter ( -_crash _ ) are used to tag the  ( fig.[fig : tagkpm ] , right ) . in these cases as well the tagging efficiencies are estimated directly from data . with the statistics of @xmath48  @xmath4",
    "we can reach a level of @xmath49 accuracy on tagging efficiencies , both for charged and neutral kaons .    as already mentioned , the second peculiar characteristic of kloe is the good resolution on the kaon momentum . for neutral kaons ,",
    "the resolution on  momentum ( @xmath50 ) relies on the resolution of the  momentum ( @xmath511me-.07em v , measured with the drift chamber using  events ) , and on the fact that @xmath52 is measured run by run using bhabha events and contributes a negligible error to the  resolution . for charged kaons ,",
    "the kaon momentum is measured directly by the drift chamber with a resolution of @xmath511me-.07em v.",
    "for charged kaons , the sample of @xmath8  events is selected by asking for a tag on one side , and for a decay vertex in the drift chamber and one @xmath53 in the electromagnetic calorimeter on the other .",
    "the time of flight information can be used to separate charged pions , muons , and electrons , exploiting the excellent timing resolution of the detector  ( fig.[fig : ke3tof ] ) .    to    most of the selection efficiencies",
    "can be evaluated directly from data using control samples : the momentum range of the lepton in @xmath54 is covered by  and  decays , while the energy range of @xmath8  @xmath53 clusters is covered by @xmath53 clusters from  and  decays .",
    "a sample of semileptonic  decays has been selected from 78  @xmath4  of 02 data by looking for a -_tag _ on one side and asking for a vertex in the drift chamber fiducial volume .",
    "the separation of the various  decays is evident in the plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : klcharged ] ) of p@xmath55e@xmath55 in the @xmath56 or @xmath57 mass ( the mass assignment used is that which gives the smaller value of p@xmath55e@xmath55 in each event )",
    ". the difference of tagging efficiencies for the decay channel of the tagged particle is less than 1% , estimated by mc .    to    for this sample , fitting the data distribution in figure  [ fig : klcharged ] with the mc distribution , for each of the decay channels with independent normalization constants",
    ", we get the branching ratios",
    "@xmath15  = @xmath58 , @xmath16  = @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , in good agreement with pdg values  @xcite .",
    "these results are very preliminary : the errors are statistical only , and are dominated by the lack of mc statistics .",
    "the systematic errors are also at the 1 - 2% level but have not yet been fully evaluated . in the future , the time of flight information will be used to increase the separation of pions from muons and electrons .",
    "looking at the pdg  @xcite fit for @xmath18 , some discrepancies between `` in - flight '' and `` at - rest '' measurements can be found . moreover , there are some differences between the various `` at - rest '' measurements obtained using different materials to stop kaons .",
    "a new high - statistics measurement by kloe could clarify this situation .    for neutral kaons",
    ", kloe has a preliminary measurement of the  lifetime as a by product of the measurement of the ratio @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the fit of the distribution of the  @xmath62 decay vertex position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taul ] ) gives @xmath63  ns ( the error is statistical only , from the 36  @xmath4used for this estimate ) , in good agreement with the world average , @xmath64  ns  @xcite ) .    to",
    "using experimental inputs from the pdg  @xcite , four evaluations of the physical observable @xmath19  can be made ( black points in fig .  [",
    "fig : vusnew ] ) .",
    "kloe preliminary branching ratio measurements of @xmath15  and @xmath16   confirm the previous value for @xmath19   ( red open points in fig .",
    "[ fig : vusnew ] ) .",
    "also the kloe preliminary branching ratio measurement of  = @xmath65 ( upgrade with 2001 data of the 2000 result  @xcite ) gives a @xmath19  value in agreement with the kloe  and pdg estimations ( red point in fig .",
    "[ fig : vusnew ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that each kloe point in fig .",
    "[ fig : vusnew ] has a statistical precision comparable to the pdg one which represents the fit or average of several experiments .",
    "moreover , for most of the branching ratio measurements in the pdg it is not clear if these correspond to photon inclusive widths .    to",
    "the kloe preliminary measurements of  charged decays and of  branching ratios are currently at 2% level , while the @xmath17  is measured with a precision of 1% .",
