    "since the discovery of superconductivity ( sc ) in mercury 100 years ago,@xcite thousands of superconductors have been found in various kind of materials including elements , alloys , inorganic compounds and organic compounds . nevertheless , sc was shown to be incompatible with magnetism , simply manifested by that fact that all the magnetic elements do not superconduct .",
    "although sc may coexists with antiferromagnetism because superconducting coherent lengths are generally much larger than interatomic distances , it is easily destroyed by ferromagnetism ( fm ) owing to orbital@xcite and paramagnetic@xcite effects . on the other hand , sc does not support the local - moment fm via ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions.@xcite earlier experiments revealed the incompatible nature of the two collective phenomena in ( la , gd ) and ( ce , pr)ru@xmath6 solid solutions.@xcite until late 1970s possible coexistence of sc and fm was evidenced in errh@xmath7b@xmath7@xcite and ho@xmath8mo@xmath9s@xmath10@xcite , only under narrow regimes of temperature and external field .",
    "the interplay of sc and magnetic ordering was also exhibited in a family of layered compounds @xmath11ni@xmath6b@xmath6c ( @xmath11=tm , er , ho and dy)@xcite and rutheno - cuprates@xcite .",
    "another interesting coexistence was found in uge@xmath6@xcite and urhge,@xcite in which sc occurs under the ferromagnetic background ( @xmath12 ) and , both sc and fm come from the same type of electrons .",
    "the discovery of fe - based superconductors@xcite brought about new findings on the interplay of sc and fm .",
    "eufe@xmath6as@xmath6 , first synthesized in late 1970s,@xcite is a unique `` 122 '' compound which shows both sc in the feas - layers upon appropriate doping , and long - range magnetic ordering in the eu sublattice .",
    "it was found that the undoped parent compound undergoes antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering in the fe sublattice at 200 k , followed by another afm ordering in the eu sublattice at 20 k.@xcite the two subsystems are hardly coupled , as evidenced from optical@xcite and photoemission@xcite studies .",
    "the magnetic structure of the latter afm order had been proposed to be of @xmath13-type,@xcite in which eu@xmath14 spins algin ferromagnetically in the basal planes but antiferromagnetically along the @xmath15-axis , which was then confirmed by the magnetic resonant x - ray scattering@xcite and neutron diffraction@xcite experiments . by the partial substitution of eu with k , sc",
    "over 30 k was reported in eu@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath6as@xmath6.@xcite however , due to the dilution effect by the eu - site doping , no magnetic ordering for eu@xmath14 spins was observed . in attempt to obtain sc by ni doping in eufe@xmath16ni@xmath17as@xmath6@xcite ,",
    "we observed fm ordering for the eu@xmath14 moments . in the case of co doping , however , there was a superconducting transition at @xmath1821 k , followed by resistivity reentrance around 17 k.@xcite by p doping at the as - site , we found both sc at @xmath19=26 k and local - moment fm in the eu sublattice at 20 k in eufe@xmath0(as@xmath20p@xmath21)@xmath0.@xcite in this paper we report schematic investigations on how sc and fm are evolved in eufe@xmath6(as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 system , particularly focusing on where and why sc coexists with fm .",
    "polycrystalline samples of eufe@xmath6(as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 ( @xmath22=0 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.25 , 0.30 , 0.35 , 0.40 , 0.45 , 0.50 , 0.75 and 1.0 ) were synthesized by solid state reaction with euas , fe@xmath0as and fe@xmath0p .",
    "euas was prepared by reacting fresh eu grains and as powders in evacuated quartz tube at 873 k for 10 h then 1023 k for another 10 h , and ultimately 1223 k for 10 h. fe@xmath0as was presynthesized by reacting fe powers and as powders at 873 k for 10 h and 1173 k for 15 h. fe@xmath0p was prepared by heating fe powders and p powders very slowly to 873 k and then holding for 10 h. in an argon - filled glove - box , the powders of euas , fe@xmath0as and fe@xmath0p were mixed in a certain stoichiometric ratio , thoroughly ground in an agate motar and pressed into pellets .",
    "the pellets were annealed in an evacuated silica tube at 1273 k for 20 h and furnace - cooled to room temperature .",
    "the resultant eufe@xmath6(as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 samples were black in colour and rather stable in air .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed at room temperature , using a d / max - ra diffractometer with cu - k@xmath23 radiations and a graphite monochromator .",
    "the data were collected with a step - scan mode for @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26@xmath25@xmath27 .",
    "lattice parameters were refined by a least - squares fit with considerations of zero shift .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four - probe method with the applied current density of @xmath180.5a/@xmath28 .",
    "the dc magnetization was measured on a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms-5 ) .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the xrd patterns of the eufe@xmath6(as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 samples .",
    "the specimen are basically of single phase with thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type structure . for some samples , only minor amount ( @xmath29 ) of impurities of eu@xmath0o@xmath30 and fe@xmath0p was detected .",
    "the xrd patterns show systematic changes with the p content .",
    "for example , the intensity of ( 002 ) peaks increases gradually with incorporating phosphorus . both ( 008 ) and ( 200 ) peaks shift towards higher angles with increasing @xmath22 , indicating the lattice shrink .",
    "indeed , we see that both @xmath31 and @xmath15 decrease with @xmath22 in figure 1(b ) . notably , the magnitude of decrease in @xmath15 is much bigger .",
    "this is very important for the evolution of magnetic ordering in eu sublattice , since the rkky coupling is closely related to the interatomic distance of the magnetic ions@xcite .",
    "( as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 samples at room temperature .",
    "( b ) refined lattice parameters plotted as functions of p content @xmath22.,width=566 ]    figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 .",
    "the undoped eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 clearly shows two resistivity kinks at 200 k and 20 k , associated with fe - site and eu - site afm ordering , respectively .",
    "note that the transition temperatures for single crystal samples are 190 k and 19 k , respectively.@xcite this slight difference is demonstrated to be due to tiny eu - deficiency in single crystal samples ( in this sense the chemical stoichiometry can be better kept using polycrystalline samples ) . with the p doping , the magnetic transition temperature of fe sublattice ( @xmath32 ) decreases rapidly , similar to the case in bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0@xcite . on the other hand , the magnetic transition temperature of eu sublattice ( @xmath33 ) first decreases by 4 k , then starts to increase at @xmath340.15 .",
    "when the p content increases up to 20% , no anomaly associated with the fe - afm ordering can be observed , instead , a sudden decrease in resistivity is seen below 21 k , indicative of superconducting transition .",
    "besides , a shoulder ( resistivity reentrance ) appears at 16 k , which is probably due to the magnetic ordering in eu sublattice .",
    "the optimal doping is at @xmath22=0.3 where the onset superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath35 ) achieves the maximum ( 29 k ) with no resistivity reentrance at lower temperatures for our best sample .",
    "when @xmath360.45 , no sign of sc was detected , and the resistivity kinks reappear at @xmath33 . as can be seen , @xmath33 climbs with further p substitution , and arrives at 29 k for the end member eufe@xmath6p@xmath6@xcite .",
    "( as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 polycrystalline samples . to explicitly show the regimes that have different characteristic , we separate into three groups from right to left , corresponding to lower , intermediate and higher doping .",
    "the lower panels display the expanded plots using normalized resistivity for comparison .",
    "the arrows mark the positions of the related transition temperatures.,width=566 ]    figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of two representative samples . for @xmath22=0.05 , the @xmath37 curve has a peak at @xmath33=18.5 k. meanwhile , there is bifurcation for fc and zfc branches , suggesting ferromagnetic component .",
    "the ferromagnetic component can be understood by recent mssbauer study@xcite which shows canting of the eu spins toward the @xmath15-axis with p doping .",
    "the spin canting was very recently evidenced by measuring the anisotropic magnetization for eufe@xmath0(as@xmath38p@xmath39)@xmath6 single crystals.@xcite there is another anomaly at @xmath186 k , suggesting more complicated successive magnetic transition .    for @xmath22=0.25 , the fc curve looks like the behaviour of a typical ferromagnet .",
    "the low - temperature susceptibility is 10 times larger than that of @xmath22=0.05 .",
    "more obvious bifurcation is seen for the zfc and fc curves . the @xmath40 loop ( not shown here )",
    "has a clear magnetic hysteresis , like that previously reported for @xmath22=0.3@xcite .",
    "the saturated magnetization value corresponds to the fully - aligned eu moments ( see below ) .",
    "all these facts indicate ferromagnetic ordering for the eu@xmath14 spins .",
    "the ferromagnetic curie temperature is identified at @xmath33=19 k , above which the @xmath37 data obey extended curie s law ( @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the temperature - independent term , @xmath43 the curie - weiss constant and @xmath44 the paramagnetic curie temperature ) .",
    "the data fitting gives the effective moment for eu , @xmath45=8.3 @xmath46 per formula unit , which is close to the theoretical value @xmath47=7.94 @xmath46 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49=2 ) for a free eu@xmath14 ion .",
    "the @xmath44 values are positive , in agreement with the dominant ferromagnetic interaction among eu@xmath14 spins .",
    "( as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 .",
    "( a ) @xmath22=0.05 ; ( b ) @xmath22=0.25.,width=566 ]    figures 4 displays the field dependence of magnetization for the @xmath22=0.3 sample . under the field of @xmath181 t ,",
    "the magnetization saturates to 7.1 @xmath50/f.u . at 5 k.",
    "the saturated magnetization is very close to the theoretical value of @xmath51=7.0 @xmath50/f.u . , indicating fully polarization of the eu@xmath14 spins .",
    "this fact further confirms the ferromagnetism .",
    "the non - linear @xmath40 relations above @xmath33 ( 20 k and 23 k ) reflects that the external fields help to align the eu spins ferromagnetically .",
    "the low - field magnetization [ figure 4(b ) ] does not show magnetic repulsion and shielding , as expected for a superconducting state .",
    "the absence of meissner effect could be due to the formation of spontaneous vortex ( sv ) phase@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the loss of magnetic shielding means that the resistivity is not really zero , which is ascribed to the weak links in polycrystalline samples and/or , the motion of sv which generates flow resistance .",
    "nevertheless , signature of sc can be seen from the concave curvature of the @xmath40 relation at 23 k ( which is higher than @xmath33 but lower than @xmath35 ) , where diamagnetism is inferred from the background of paramagnetism of eu@xmath14 spins .",
    "( as@xmath20p@xmath21)@xmath6 polycrystalline sample.,width=566 ]    based on the above results , we establish the magnetic and superconducting phase diagram as shown in figure 5 . for the fe sublattice , the phase diagram is similar to those of other fe - based superconductors@xcite , i.e. , the fe - afm is suppressed by the p doping , and then sc emerges .",
    "the only difference is that sc is no longer alive when @xmath52 .",
    "for the eu sublattice , the parent eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 is @xmath13-type afm ordered with eu spins lying along the @xmath31-axis . doping with phosphorus not only increases the interlayer rkky coupling , but also leads to the canting of the eu spins .",
    "according to the mssbauer study,@xcite the spin canting starts at @xmath340 , and finishes at @xmath34 0.2 , where the spin - canting angle is @xmath53 from the @xmath15-axis .",
    "therefore , for @xmath3 , sc definitely coexists with fm even at zero field .",
    "our recent magnetic compton scattering experiment for eufe@xmath0(as@xmath54p@xmath55)@xmath6 also confirms this scenario.@xcite for @xmath56 , only eu - fm state is shown .",
    "here we should mention a recent result on the phase diagram , which positions the sc dome in a narrower window around @xmath22=0.2.@xcite this discrepancy may be due to the eu - deficiency in the single crystal samples .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that sc only coexists with eu - afm .",
    "however , their following work reconciled the discrepancy in terms of the canting of eu@xmath14 spins.@xcite    ( as@xmath1p@xmath17)@xmath6 .",
    "fe - afm ( eu - afm ) denotes antiferromagnetism in the fe ( eu ) sublattice ; sc and fm refer to superconductivity and ferromagnetism , respectively.,width=302 ]    compared with the `` old '' systems with the coexistence of sc and fm , then , what is special in the present eu122 system ?",
    "here we point out three distinguishable features .",
    "1 ) the fm has an unprecedentedly large saturated moment ( @xmath57/eu ) .",
    "2 ) the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath58 is very near the superconducting transition one @xmath59 , and both are relatively high .",
    "once @xmath52 , sc disappears .",
    "3 ) sc coexists with fm in broad ranges of temperature and field .",
    "all these features make the eu122 system worthwhile for further study .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss why sc and fm are compatible in the eu122 system .",
    "first of all , the superconducting upper critical fields @xmath60 in 122 fe - based superconductors are very high ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath1860 t for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite ) . the @xmath60 values are actually higher than the hyperfine field on eu nucleus ( @xmath1828 t ) from the mssbauer measurement@xcite .",
    "this makes sc survive even in the presence of a strong internal field via rkky interactions .",
    "secondly , it was indicated that all the five fe-3@xmath4 orbitals contribute the density of states near fermi level.@xcite however , only @xmath61 and @xmath62 orbitals are most probably related to sc.@xcite the @xmath63 and @xmath64 electrons are supposed to be responsible for mediating rkky interactions.@xcite consequently , both sc and fm are well supported . in this sense , therefore , the eu122 system seems to be a very rare platform for studying the challenging issues of the coexistence of sc and fm .",
