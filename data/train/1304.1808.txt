    "mass is the most fundamental property of a black hole .",
    "it defines both a length scale and a time scale and , in conjunction with the black hole s spin , provides a complete description of any astronomical black hole .",
    "knowledge of mass is essential in assessing how a black hole interacts with its environment .",
    "for example , it defines the eddington luminosity , the maximum isotropic radiative luminosity that a black hole can achieve . in this paper , we present accurate dynamical data for the x - ray transient grs1915 + 105 , including a significantly refined measurement of the mass of its black hole primary .",
    "black hole x - ray transients are compact binaries where a stellar mass black hole accretes from a typically low - mass companion ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "they show complex and varied outburst behaviour , though they spend most of their life in a relatively low accretion rate state . in many respects ,",
    "the most extraordinary such system is grs1915 + 105 .",
    "it has remained active since its eruption and discovery in 1992 , while other black hole transients return to quiescence after only a year or so following an outburst .",
    "not only has grs1915 + 105  remained active , it is frequently observed in super - eddington states when it is the most luminous accreting black hole in the galaxy ( @xmath6 erg / s , e.g. done et al .",
    "the secondary is a k - type giant ( greiner et al .",
    "2001a ) , and the binary system is far larger than that of any other black hole transient .",
    "its 34-day orbital period is five times that of second - place v404 cyg , and the volume of the roche lobe of its black hole is correspondingly fifty times larger .",
    "concerning x - ray variability , grs1915 + 105   is spectacularly unique .",
    "more than a dozen distinct x - ray states have been identified ( belloni et al .",
    "2000 ; klein - wolt 2002 ) , and the source displays a constellation of four high - frequency qpos , rather than the customary one or two ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . as the prototype of microquasars , the signature feature of grs1915 + 105  is its pc - scale bipolar radio jet ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; fender et al .",
    "the jet is likely powered by the spin of the black hole ( narayan & mcclintock 2012 ) ; the spin is extreme ( @xmath7 ) and far higher than that measured for other black hole transients ( mcclintock et al .  2006 ;",
    "blum et al.2009 ) .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "the most interesting contrast between grs1915 + 105  and the other black hole transients is the greater mass of its black hole primary .",
    "the black hole mass of grs1915 + 105  was first measured by greiner et al .",
    "( 2001b , hereafter g01 ) to be @xmath8 .",
    "it is accurate to describe this dynamical study by g01 as pioneering for two reasons .",
    "first , the observations were necessarily made in the near - infrared because the system is inaccessible at optical wavelengths , with @xmath9  mag ( chapuis & corbel 2005 ; rahoui et al.2010 ) .",
    "second , this was the first successful dynamical study of a black hole transient in an active state in the presence of intense x - ray heating . as has often been remarked , the nominal mass measured by greiner et al .",
    "is much greater than the masses of other black hole transients , which fall in a relatively narrow range ( @xmath10 ; ozel et al .",
    "2010 , see also farr et al .",
    "however , given the relatively large uncertainty on the black hole mass , this difference is not at high statistical significance .    for their dynamical study",

    "hurley et al . ( 2013 ) recently revisited the isaac data together with additional unpublished data . here",
    "we present higher spectral resolution data aimed at significantly improving the precision with which we can determine the black hole mass .",
    "our data were obtained with the x - shooter  spectrograph that was recently commissioned on the vlt ( vernet et al .",
    "thanks to its multi - arm echellette design , x - shooter  offers a much wider spectral bandpass at higher dispersion while s / n is excellent thanks to its high throughput . in section [ obs ] , we discuss our observational campaign and detail our data reduction and analysis in section [ redu ] .",

    "a key strength of the x - shooter  instrument is its ability to simultaneously observe both the full optical band as well as the near - infrared across its three arms at an intermediate spectral resolution and with high throughput ( vernet et al . 2011 ) . due to the high extinction towards grs1915 + 105",
    ", we did not anticipate detecting the source with the vlt shortwards of the j - band . despite this",
    ", x - shooter  is still the ideal instrument for nir spectroscopy of grs1915 + 105   given its optimal compromise between high efficiency , sufficient resolution and full coverage of the nir bands up to 2.48@xmath11 .",
    "all our observations employed a 0.6 `` slit to achieve a spectral resolution of r=8,000 in the nir arm , representing a significant improvement over the r=3,000 spectra obtained with isaac ( greiner et al . 2001a ; g01 ; hurley et al .",
    "seeing conditions were constrained to better than 0.8 '' in order to control slit - losses . at each epoch ,",
    "three 15 minute exposures were obtained while nodding along the slit in between these exposures to mitigate sky background subtraction errors . given that the x - shooter  acquisition camera operates in the optical band , where grs1915 + 105   is extremely faint ( @xmath12 ) , the target was acquired using @xmath13-band ( 900 nm ) acquisition images , applying a fixed offset relative to a nearby field star to align the target on slit .    in total , 24 sets of exposures were obtained between june 9th 2010 and august 4th 2011 in service mode by the ut2 team . in addition , exposures of telluric standards were obtained close in time with each target visit and 5 bright k - m type giants were observed with the same setup to serve as spectral templates for the data analysis .",
    "see table [ obslog ] for a log of observations .",
    "we reduced these data using version 1.3.7 of the x - shooter pipeline .",
    "the standard recipes were used to optimally extract and wavelength calibrate both the target observations as well as our telluric and spectral standard stars .",
    "the 3 nodded sub - exposures for each epoch were combined before extraction to obtain a single good s / n spectrum while improving sky subtraction .",
    "the resultant spectra cover 9940 - 24790  at 0.6 / pixel though grs1915 + 105  is only significantly detected longwards of 11500 .",
    "the wavelength calibration step makes use of a daytime arc exposure . from these",
    "we also confirmed that our achieved spectral resolution was indeed r=8,000 , delivering a resolution element of width 3.5 detector pixels .    given that our data were obtained over a fairly long time - interval",
    ", we removed any residual wavelength shifts between epochs by forcing telluric features to align .",
    "this was achieved by cross - correlation of the same spectral segment in the k - band that is dominated by well - resolved tellurics .",
    "spectra were first re - binned to a constant velocity - scale of 11 km / s / pixel in order to ensure that by shifting spectra for cross - correlation purposes , pixel shifts map to global velocity shifts .",
    "we found significant shifts between spectra ranging from -10 to + 13 km / s with an rms of 5 km / s . while these shifts were only of the order of one pixel , measurement uncertainties were much less than 1 km / s thanks to the high s / n in the k - band tellurics .",
    "we also tried different telluric regions and found that the resultant shifts were always consistent within 1 - 2 km / s .",
    "we thus found that this step improved the stability of our wavelength scale across our campaign to better than 2 km / s .",
    "once aligned , we then used the relevant telluric star observations closest to each target observation to perform a telluric correction by scaling with a continuum normalised version of the telluric .",
    "the telluric - corrected spectra were then shifted into a heliocentric velocity frame , making appropriate time and velocity corrections .",
    "all velocities and times quoted in this paper are thus in a heliocentric frame , using the utc time system .",
    "we note that the available telluric stars were of early spectral type and different epochs were corrected with different telluric stars .",
    "some artefacts are thus introduced in the target spectra due to absorption features in the tellurics themselves , mainly restricted to hydrogen absorption .",
    "this does not affect our analysis as we are only considering the absorption features of the late type donor in grs1915 + 105 , but this does limit the ability to use our data to analyse any hydrogen emission profiles in grs1915 + 105 .",
    "in order to determine radial velocities ( rvs ) of the donor star features in grs1915 + 105  at each epoch , we normalised our target and spectral template observations and again used the cross - correlation technique to determine the radial velocity shifts between target and template .",
    "as mentioned previously , the data were binned to a constant velocity sampling per pixel to facilitate this .",
    "suitable masks were defined to exclude regions where grs1915 + 105  has emission features and to mask any residual telluric standard features .",
    "in addition , a significant number of hot pixels were present in the extracted spectra that had to be flagged and masked .",
    "this was an iterative procedure largely based on visual inspection as the severity of these hot pixels varied greatly from epoch to epoch .",
    "some of these are introduced by anomalous pixels in the telluric template , others in the target spectrum .",
    "masking is preferred over attempting to interpolate over such pixels / features as incorrect interpolation could lead to spurious velocities .",
    "several spectral regions were investigated to test the robustness of our velocities .",
    "the choice of these regions were largely motivated by identifying suitable regions where significant absorption features from the k - type donor are expected , telluric absorption is reduced and adequate s / n was available .",
    "this led us to focus on two key spectral regions ; i ) 14300 - 17800  ( hereafter referred to as the h - band window ) where a number of atomic absorption lines are to be found in a region of reduced telluric absorption and ii ) 22200 - 24800  ( k - band window ) where the strong co - bands are located that were previously used to determine the rv of the donor star in grs1915 + 105 . within each region , a number of masks were compared in order to ensure that the exact choice of pixels to mask had no significant impact on the derived radial velocities . in each band , we cross - correlated all 24 target exposures with the 5 spectral template stars .",
    "we found that the pipeline did not produce robust uncertainties that would allow us to propagate these uncertainties into a correct formal radial velocity error .",
    "this is not surprising given the complex nature of extracting near - infrared spectroscopy from an echellette - type instrument .",
    "instead , we used our rv fit residuals to determine a robust and realistic rv uncertainty by calculating the covariance matrix derived from weighted least - squares fits . by comparing different spectral regions , pixel masks and independent spectral templates",
    ", we also have a good handle on possible systematic effects .",
    "initial rv fits using the established spectroscopic orbital period of p=33.5d confirmed the detection of moving donor star features consistent with previous work . in order to establish a more robust orbital period , we calculated lomb - scargle normalised periodograms using our 24 velocities covering a baseline of over a year .",
    "a strong peak at the orbital frequency was invariably present near @xmath14d ( see figure [ scargleplot ] ) with minor variations in the peak position between different templates at the level of @xmath15d .",
    "this is larger than the 33.5d period adopted by g01 , though within their quoted uncertainty .",
    "hurley et al . ( 2013 ) recently revisited the vlt data analysed by g01 as well as some additonal data and also favour a period close to 33.8d .",
    "our ability to improve upon the previously reported period is corroborated by the fact that using p=33.5d results in significantly poorer rv fits .",
    "our rv analysis also rules out the possibility that the 30.8 day photometric period reported by neil , bailyn & cobb ( 2007 ) is the orbital period .",
    "phase folding our rvs on either this period , or our closest alias , leads to very poor fits . to determine the binary phase",
    ", we used our rv data and allowed the phase zero point ( donor star conjunction ) as well as the period to vary to assess optimal values and uncertainties on these parameters .",
    "this delivered the following ephemeris that we will use throughout this paper to calculate orbital phases :    @xmath16    we found that formal fit parameter uncertainties were larger than the variations amongst the 5 sets of rvs using different templates .",
    "the particular choice of the latter therefore has no significant impact on the ephemeris .",

    "we see that our semi - amplitude is robustly determined with typical fit uncertainties of 1 - 1.5 km / s , and that there is excellent agreement between different templates .",
    "we find a marginal difference between the semi - amplitudes derived from the h and k - band , with the h - band delivering slightly lower values .",

    "this allows us to confidently constrain the projected donor star orbital velocity to @xmath21km / s , representing a significant improvement over previous work ( g01 ; @xmath22km / s ) .",
    "this improvement is due to a combination of significantly higher spectral resolution than employed previously , wide wavelength coverage allowing us to include many lines , better s / n per epoch and more extensive phase coverage .",
    "the resolution in particular is key to allow for a good sky and telluric correction as well as resolving the narrow donor star features .",

    "such a high value is ruled out by our data which have been carefully aligned using the telluric features as described above and is based on a comparison with a radial velocity standard star observed and reduced in an identical manner .",
    "having determined the radial velocities for all epochs , we subtracted the radial velocity from each spectrum so as to align all spectra in the rest - frame of the donor star .",
    "all spectra were then averaged in order to construct a high s / n spectrum highlighting any donor star features .",
    "this confirmed the presence of many absorption features in common between grs1915 + 105  and our templates , as expected given the excellent results from the cross - correlation analysis . in figure [ specplot ] ,",
    "we plot a few representative spectral regions illustrating this match .",

    "[ vsiniplot],width=340 ]    armed with a high s / n spectrum of grs1915 + 105  in its donor rest - frame , we used this to determine the rotational broadening of the donor ( @xmath26 ) by subtracting a scaled and broadened version of the templates from this average spectrum .",
    "the scaling factor reflects the fact that not all of the light originates from the donor , while the amount of applied rotational broadening was varied in order to assess which amount of broadening achieves the best subtraction .",
    "here we used @xmath27 as our goodness of fit parameter , by comparing the residuals between this subtracted spectrum and a smoothed version of the original spectrum ( figure [ vsiniplot]a ) .",

    "we find optimal values ranging from 17 - 25 km / s with uncertainties of 2 - 3 km / s for a given template and spectral region .",
    "the donor star appears , on average , to make a 20 - 25% contribution to the k - band flux .",
    "we note that this small amount of broadening spans 2 - 3 pixels , but is just below our formal spectral resolution ( 3.5 pixels )",
    ". we must therefore be cautious about this measurement despite the consistency among the 5 templates .",
    "we have used template stars observed with the same instrument to ensure that the instrumental contribution to the line profile shape is the same .",

    "distance estimates for grs1915 + 105  cover 6 - 12 kpc , though @xmath33 kpc is most commonly adopted , as this distance is consistent with a number of independent determinations ( see the discussion in zdziarski et al .",

    "the error allows for a 20 km / s peculiar velocity component , but this may still be too small if the grs1915 + 105  progenitor binary system received a substantial kick when the black hole was formed .",

    "we are also conducting a long - term vlbi campaign in order to determine the distance to grs1915 + 105  via the trigonometric parallax method .",

    "specifically , we use gauss - normal distributions for @xmath28 , @xmath26 and the binary period using the 1@xmath44 errors derived from our data . for the inclination , we start by picking a random distance from our adopted distance range and use the fender et al .",
    "( 1999 ) mapping to translate this into a binary inclination . here",
    "we use a random uniform distribution rather than a normal distribution given that we merely assume the distance to lie within a certain range . with all parameters then picked for each monte - carlo trial , the underlying calculation simply uses kepler s law where each @xmath28 and @xmath26 pair is combined to deliver the mass ratio for that trial as explained above ( see figure [ massplot ] ) .    for @xmath45 kpc",
    "we find @xmath46 and for the donor @xmath47 .",
    "we again stress that the contributions from all individual parameter estimates are included in these mass errors .",
    "if we only apply loose constraints on the distance ( @xmath48 kpc ) , this results in @xmath49 . even in this latter case ,",

    "this velocity was robust against choice of template star and wavelength range . since our spectra cover a large number of atomic lines , we do not rely on molecular bandheads as was done previously , although we find that the two types of features give consistent results , suggesting that at our spectral resolution the use of co band - heads poses no problems .",
    "the systemic velocity of the binary system relative to the heliocentre was determined to be @xmath50km / s by comparison with a radial velocity standard .",
    "if we assume that this motion tracks the galactic rotation curve , a distance of @xmath51 kpc is implied .",
    "we combined our individual spectra to construct a high s / n spectrum in the restframe of the mass donor star .",
    "this allowed us to determine the rotational broadening of the donor @xmath2 km / s , equivalent to a radius of @xmath30 , as well as the binary mass ratio @xmath3 .",
    "combining all parameters allows us to constrain the black hole mass tightly , with the key remaining uncertaintly being the assumed binary inclination . using the commonly adopted distance and inclination , we find @xmath46 .",
    "a more conservative calculation based on only loose distance constraints leads to @xmath49 .",
    "our new mass determination brings the black hole mass of grs1915 + 105  closer in line with core collapse simulations and the stellar bh mass distribution ( ozel et al . 2010 ; farr et al .",

    "the implied mass for the donor ( @xmath47 ) is quite small and lower than the typical mass of a k / m field giant .",
    "although the spectral characteristics of the donor star in grs1915 + 105  appear to be consistent with a k / m giant , it is not uncommon to find under - massive secondaries in accreting binaries due to the evolved nature of such systems ( e.g. casares et al .",
