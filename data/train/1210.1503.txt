    "quantum mechanical system with a spatially varying effective mass have attracted a lot of attention and inspired intense research activities during recent years .",
    "special applications are carried out in the study of electronic properties of semiconductors @xcite , quantum wells and quantum dots @xcite , @xcite , 3he clusters @xcite , quantum liquids @xcite graded alloys and semiconductor heterostructures @xcite  etc .",
    "these studies stimulated a lot of work in the literature on the development of methods and techniques for studying systems with mass that depends on position .",
    "moreover , the bloch propagator or its fourier transform namely the green function are of prime significance since they contain all quantum mechanical informations on the system . to our knowledge the existing list devoted to the study on the bloch propagator of quantum systems involving position dependent effective mass is very short and is limited to the one dimensional case @xcite , @xcite . this has motivated the present work .",
    "we wish to obtain approximate analytical expression for the propagator or at least for its diagonal parts in spatial dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is called the slater sum . for this purpose",
    ", we make use of a semiclassical approximation to derive analytical expressions of the slater sum up to order @xmath3 when the effective mass is allowed to be position dependent . for any exact result of the slater sum , when expanded up to order @xmath3 , our resulting expression may constitute a good test since it is valid for arbitrary potential and spatially varying effective mass .",
    "semiclassical @xmath4 expansion may be generated through a variety of procedures in order to obtain * * the @xmath4 expansion of the density matrix .",
    "we mention , for instance ,  the partition function method of wigner - kirkwood and further development by bhaduri and collaborators ( see ref . @xcite and references cited therein ) , the kirzhnits expansion using commutator formalism ( see ref . @xcite and references cited therein ) , @xcite , @xcite and the purely algebraic method introduced by baraff and borowich @xcite and developed by grammaticos and voros @xcite , based on the wigner transform of operators .",
    "the latter method is particularly suitable for position dependent mass hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "these authors derived the semiclassical @xmath4 expansions for the 3-dimensional one particle density and also for other densities of physical interest when the kinetic energy operator of the one - particle hamiltonian contains a spatially dependent effective mass .",
    "later on , we have generalized @xcite , @xcite such expansion , up to order @xmath3 , for systems with effective mass distribution and reduced dimensionality , i.e , @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "it should be noted that corrections of order @xmath3 generate second order gradient corrections not only in the one - body potential but also in the effective mass distribution .",
    "here , we are interested in obtaining the gradient expansion of * * the slater sum in @xmath5 and @xmath6 spatial dimensions for hamiltonians with position dependent mass ( the result in @xmath7 is already known ) .",
    "the the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath8 we briefly recall some basic definitions concerning the use of the bloch propagator  and its relationship to the density matrix .",
    "starting from the semiclassical @xmath4 expansion for the particle density , we derive , in section @xmath9 , the corresponding expansion up to second order in @xmath4 for the  slater sum in @xmath5 and @xmath6  spatial dimensions for hamiltonians with position dependent mass .",
    "a general analytical expression is found in terms of the space dimension @xmath0 .",
    "section @xmath6 provides an illustrative numerical example .",
    "finally , a conclusion is given in section @xmath10",
    "consider a system of @xmath11  noninteracting fermions with spatially varying effective mass @xmath12 moving in a smooth potential @xmath13 . throughout the present study",
    ", we shall be working with the one - body hamiltonian given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the ratio of the free particle mass @xmath16 to the position dependent effective mass @xmath12 and where we use , as done in the majority of work on the subject , the symmetric ordering form of mass and momentum in the kinetic energy term of @xmath17    let @xmath18be the eigenfunctions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 the corresponding eigenvalues , i.e ; @xmath21 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the single - particle density matrix of the system @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fermi energy and @xmath25 is the heaviside step function which allows to restrict the sum over occupied states only .",
    "given the above density matrix , the bloch propagator @xmath26 , defined as [ see for instance @xcite ] @xmath27 can be obtained through the laplace transform result@xmath28 it should be noted that , in quantum statistics and thermodynamics , @xmath29 is an inverse of temperature : @xmath30 with @xmath31 the boltzmann constant ; but if we now replace @xmath29 in equation ( 3 ) by @xmath32 , the resulting propagator @xmath33 describes the propagation of the single particle from @xmath34 @xmath35 in time @xmath36 .",
    "however in the subsequent analysis @xmath29 is to be viewed as a complex parameter .",
    "the interest in the bloch propagator is that it contains all quantum mechanical informations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , from which the density matrix @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) may be obtained by suitable inverse laplace transform , that is @xmath38 note that , to carry out the complex integration in equation ( 5 ) , the parameter @xmath29 , as stated before , is considered as a complex mathematical variable .",
    "putting @xmath39 in equation ( 4 ) , we evidently get @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the diagonal elements of the bloch propagator , called also the slater sum , and @xmath42 is the particle density .    with the above analysis ,",
    "all the results are formally exact . in the next section",
    "we shall use these results within the framework of gradient expansion .",
    "notice that for the case of constant effective mass hamiltonians , the local version of equation ( 5 ) has been used to calculate the density from the bloch propagator @xcite . for hamiltonians with position dependent mass , we invert the procedure and use equation ( 6 ) to get the bloch propagator since , as stated before ,",
    "the gradient expansions of the density are known .",
    "in this section , explicit @xmath4 expansions will be presented for the slater sum through the use of equation ( 6 ) .",
    "for that , we directly use the @xmath4 expansions of the particle density @xmath42 derived in @xcite .",
