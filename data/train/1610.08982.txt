    "decay of superflow has been regarded as an important phenomenon in the study of superfluidity since the seminal work done by landau @xcite .",
    "as long as the flow velocity is sufficiently small , a state carrying superflow is metastable due to the existence of an energy barrier , i.e. , the superflow persists",
    ". however , when the flow velocity exceeds a certain critical value , the energy barrier vanishes and the superflow decays .",
    "the critical velocity has been observed in various experiments with ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the critical - velocity scenario of the decay of superflow has to be modified in low - dimensional systems , especially in one dimension ( 1d ) , where the effect of quantum and thermal fluctuations is significant .",
    "with such strong fluctuations , a superflow can decay even below the critical velocity due to phase slips ( ps ) , which unwind the phase of the superfluid order parameter to nucleate topological defects , such as solitons or quantum vortices  @xcite .",
    "there are three kinds of ps , either of which emerges depending on the temperature .",
    "near zero temperature , a ps occurs through purely quantum tunneling and is called quantum ps ( qps ) .",
    "when the temperature is rather high but sufficiently low compared to the energy barrier , thermal fluctuations dominate over quantum ones and allow the state to go over the energy barrier .",
    "this type of ps is called thermally activated ps ( taps ) . in an intermediate temperature ,",
    "thermal fluctuations are too weak to overcome the energy barrier but so strong that the initial state is mixed with several different states localized at the metastable minimum .",
    "this thermal mixing enhances the rate of quantum tunneling and such a ps is called thermally assisted quantum ps ( taqps ) . previous works",
    "@xcite showed that the nucleation rates of the three kinds of ps exhibit different parameter dependence , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for small @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a certain constant , @xmath3 the flow velocity , @xmath5 the temperature , @xmath6 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath7 the energy barrier .",
    "the superfluid transport of trapped ultracold gases has been often studied through measuring the damping of dipole oscillations ( do ) induced by a sudden displacement of the harmonic trapping potential  @xcite . in the absence of scatterers , such as impurities and optical lattices ,",
    "the do is undamped for many periods  @xcite . even in the presence of an optical lattice ,",
    "a bose - einstein condensate in a 3d ( nearly isotropic ) trap exhibits undamped do below the critical velocity  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , strong damping has been observed in a 1d superfluid , which is confined by a strong 2d optical lattice in the transverse direction , in the presence of the scatterers  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed damping may be interpreted as a manifestation of ps  @xcite .",
    "specifically , in the recent experiment by the lens group , they have measured the velocity dependence of the damping rate in 1d bose gases in a shallow optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "they have argued the observation of the crossover from taqps to qps , which is predicted to occur when the velocity increases at sufficiently low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that their argument is not based on quantitative comparison with any theoretical results .",
    "moreover , since the experiment has been performed at finite temperatures ( specifically , @xmath8 ) , it is possible that not only quantum fluctuations but also thermal ones may contribute to some of their experimental results . hence , in order to clarify whether the observed damping is rooted in quantum or thermal nature , one needs to quantitatively evaluate the rate of taps .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the effect of taps on the damping of do in 1d bose gases in a shallow optical lattice .",
    "we first consider a system with no harmonic trapping potential to calculate the nucleation rate of taps for wide parameter ranges of the filling factor @xmath9 and the velocity @xmath3 by using the kramers formula @xcite . within the local density approximation ( lda ) , we next relate the nucleation rate of ps to the damping rate of do and compare the latter with the lens experiment .",
    "our results agree quantitatively with the experiment in a weakly - correlated region .",
    "this indicates that taps gives a dominant contribution to the damping in that region over qps or taqps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the system considered in this paper . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the method to calculate the nucleation rate .",

    "v , we summarize our study . in the appendix , we discuss the difference between our results with and without use of the tight - binding approximation .",
    "in the experiment , the lens group used @xmath10k atoms and confined them in 1d tubes @xcite .",
    "the 1d systems were created by using a 2d deep optical lattice in the transverse directions to split a 3d bose - einstein condensate .",

    "an optical lattice with period @xmath16 and depth @xmath17 is added in the longitudinal direction , where @xmath18 is the lattice depth measured by the recoil energy .",
