    "<S> * soliton motion in a parametrically ac - driven damped toda lattice *    2 the important role of collective nonlinear excitations in the form of solitons in several condensed - matter physics contexts is widely recognized @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , discrete nonlinear models have received an increased amount of attention lately@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . often actual observation of nontrivial dynamical effects in realistic systems are impeded by friction . </S>",
    "<S> compensation of friction and support a soliton therefore usually require an externally applied driving force @xcite . in the simplest case , progressive motion of a soliton in the presence of dissipation </S>",
    "<S> is supported by a dc driving force @xcite , which in fact is the only possibility in a homogeneous continuum medium . </S>",
    "<S> a less obvious but physically important option is to drive a soliton by an ac force ( with no dc component ) either in a continuum system subjected to a periodic spatial modulation @xcite , or in a discrete system in the form of a chain of nonlinearly interacting particles @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple example of the latter system is the ac - driven damped toda lattice ( tl ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the displacement of the @xmath2-th particle , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the amplitude and frequency of the driving force and @xmath5 is the friction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this model describes a chain of nonlinearly coupled particles in a dissipative environment driven by an externally applied electric ac field . </S>",
    "<S> the alternating sign in front of the driving term , @xmath6 ( a discrete pattern of this type is frequently called _ staggered _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , implies alternating electrical charges of the particles in the chain ; without the multiplier @xmath6 , the driving term can be trivially eliminated from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it was demonstrated analytically and numerically that the model ( [ direct ] ) indeed supports progressive motion of a soliton in the presence of finite friction ( this was accomplished for this model in the so - called dual form ) . </S>",

    "<S> the model ( [ parametric ] ) describes a physical system in the form , for example , of a chain of particles adsorbed on a solid surface and interacting through an anharmonic repulsive potential . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the particles interact with a uniform external field aligned perpendicular to the adsorbing surface . </S>",
    "<S> ( the flield may simply be gravitation , or a dc electric field ) . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> all the particles are assumed to have the same charge ( and the interaction between them within the chain is generated by the charges through coulomb repulsion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effective drive is induced by a standing acoustic ( elastic ) wave excited on the surface , the end particles in the chain being fixed at the surface edges . if the length of the surface ( i.e. the length of the chain ) is @xmath10 , and the number of the particles is @xmath11 , in the equilibrium state the repelling particles are separated by the distance @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the finite size of the surface selects the wavelengths of the standing elastic waves @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an arbitrary integer ( the number of the standing half - waves ) . </S>",
    "<S> commensurability between the adsorbed chain and the standing wave takes place provided @xmath15 , where @xmath16 . if the commensurability index @xmath17 is odd , starting from @xmath18 , the distance between neighboring particles in the adsorbed chain is equal to an odd number of the standing half - waves , hence the ac driving forces acting upon the neighboring particles are @xmath19 out - of - phase , yielding the staggered from of the driving term in ( [ parametric ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> oppositely , when @xmath17 is even , the phase shift between the neighboring particles is a multiple of @xmath20 corresponding to the unstaggered driving force . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is necessary to specify the boundary conditions for the standing elastic wave . </S>",
    "<S> if the edges of the surface are fixed , the particles in the adsorbed chain are located at the nodes ( zero - amplitude points ) of the standing wave . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that in this case the external field oriented perpendicular to the surface gives rise to the direct driving - force term in eq . </S>",

    "<S> if the edges are free , the particles are located at the standing - wave maximum - amplitude points , which gives rise to the _ parametric _ drive in eq . </S>",

    "<S> shall first numerically demostrated that the model ( [ parametric ] ) is able to sustain propagating soliton - like solutions which velocity locked to the frequency of the drive . </S>",
    "<S> further , we demonstrate that only in the presence of the staggered driving force is the soliton like solutions supported . </S>",
    "<S> the locking of the velocity to the driving frequency and the fact that the soliton like solutions needs a staggered drive to exist is then explained analytically and the threshold of the driving amplitude is found . </S>",
    "<S> finally the relaxation dynamics of the particles in the wake of the soliton is studied analytically .    </S>",
    "<S> the system of equations ( 1 ) was solved numerically for a chain consisting of @xmath21 particles . </S>",

    "<S> the velocity @xmath26 is given as @xmath27 launching the soliton ( [ soliton ] ) into the system ( [ parametric ] ) gives rise to scenarios such as those depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) and 1(b ) . in the case of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) the friction is very small ( @xmath28 ) and the initial kink transforms into a propagating front and in the wake of the front the particles suffer relatively strong oscillations and only slowly relax to their equilibrium position . in the case of stronger friction ( @xmath29 ) fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) shows that the front is still created but the oscillations of the wake particles are strongly overdamped and the particles therefore relax rapidly to their initial positions . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the net shift generated by the passing front is zero , which in some sense makes the driven front `` more solitary '' than the soliton of the unperturbed tl .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is quite different when an unstaggered driving force is applied . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows a representative example of the motion of a driven front in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the front is seen to form in much the same fashion as in the model with the staggered drive . </S>",
    "<S> the front is however decreasing in amplitude and eventually ceases to exist . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can exist for rather long times , up to 100 periods ( @xmath30 ) of the driving force .    since the front in the staggered model behaves similarly to a soliton , </S>",
    "<S> an interesting experiment is to launch counter propagating fronts into the same system and observe their behavior . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such an experiment is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 and it is clearly seen that the fronts survive the collision </S>",
    "<S> . a closer study of trajectories of the two fronts shows that the velocity is unchanged by the collision and that no phase shift occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> we now investigate the observed phenomenon analytically and specify the region of existence in parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the velocity of the propagating front is controlled by the frequency of the driving force . as in @xcite , the analytical consideration </S>",

    "<S> @xcite shows that the ac - driven motion of the soliton is expected at the same resonant velocities ( [ spectrum_odd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unstaggered drive , however , gives rise to the resonant velocities @xmath32    the goal of the analytical approach is to predict the minimum ( _ threshold _ ) value @xmath33 of the ac - drive amplitude @xmath3 that is sufficient to compensate the friction and allow progressive motion of the soliton . </S>",
    "<S> each value of the integer @xmath34 in ( [ spectrum_odd ] ) and ( [ spectrum_even ] ) should thus give rise to a corresponding function @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> steady motion of the soliton through the damped driven lattice is possible if the momentum lost by each particle under the action of the friction force , @xmath36 , is balanced by the momentum input from the driving force , @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ shift ] ) was used . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum input is @xmath39 where integration by parts was performed and the contribution from @xmath40 was neglected ( since it is zero on avarage ) . </S>",
    "<S> the integral in ( [ input ] ) can be calculated explicitly , inserting the expression for @xmath41 following from the unperturbed soliton solution ( [ soliton ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result depends on the arbitrary phase constant @xmath25 ; the threshold is determined by equating the maximum possible absolute value of the momentum input ( [ input ] ) to the absolute value of the momentum loss ( [ loss ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> after a simple calculation , this leads to the equality @xmath42 replacing the combination @xmath43 by what follows from eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ balance ] ) vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the threshold ( @xmath45 ) becomes infinite , simply indicating that the progressive motion of the soliton can not be supported by the _ </S>",

    "<S> ( [ spectrum_odd ] ) for the staggered driving leads to the meaningful result @xmath46 where the parameter @xmath47 is determined , as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath48 , by a transcendental equation following from eqs . </S>",

    "<S> further we find that the soliton velocity locks to the driving frequency even when the initial velocity deviates slightly from the resonate velocity . </S>",

    "<S> the threshold characteristic of the driven motion was measured numerically in the following way . at a fixed value of the driving amplitude @xmath3 , the simulations were run at different values of @xmath4 , gradually increasing the friction coefficient until reaching a maximum value @xmath56 , beyond which the drive could no longer support the stable moving soliton . in terms of eq . </S>",

    "<S> it is also noteworthy that the simplified approximation ( [ threshold_approx ] ) works much worse than the full perturbative approximation based on eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xi0 ] ) this is not surprising : even for the largest frequency , @xmath62 , for which the result of the direct simulations is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the condition ( [ condition ] ) , necessary for applicability of the simplified approximation , takes the form @xmath63 .    finally , the slow relaxation of the oscillations behind the passing soliton can be easily analyzed . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ linear ] ) can be sought as a sum of a rapidly oscillating staggered component and a slowly relaxing unstaggered one @xmath65 substituting this into ( [ linear ] ) and collecting the staggered and unstaggered terms , we obtain two simple equations : @xmath66 using the fact that , in the present approximation , the friction is much weaker than the inertia , and following the assumption according to which the unstaggered part of the solution is slowly relaxing ( in comparison with the rapid oscillations of @xmath67 ) , one can readily obtain the following approximate solution to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ harmonic ] ) : @xmath68 next , substituting ( [ x ] ) into ( [ x ] ) and replacing the rapidly oscillating term with its avaraged value , we obtain an effective equation governing the slow relaxation of the state left behind the passing soliton : @xmath69 depending on a relation between the small parameters @xmath5 and @xmath70 , this equation may describe both oscillatory and aperiodic relaxation to the final state @xmath71 , which is the equilibrium state that existed before the passage of the soliton . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a numerical study of the relaxations shows that the frequency specified by eq.([last ] ) is the relaxation frequency observed in the full simulation .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated , analytically and numerically , that a staggered parametric ac driving term can support stable progressive motion of solitons in a damped toda lattice , while an unstaggered drive can not . also , the threshold condition for the existence of the ac - driven soliton predicted by our perturbation theory is in reasonable agreement with that found numerically , though there remains a clear difference . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations demonstrate that the state left behind the moving soliton gradually relaxes back to the equilibrium state that existed before the passage of the soliton , which we easily explained analytically . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrated that collisions between two solitons moving with opposite velocities are nearly elastic .    </S>",
