    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like resonance by atlas and cms collaborations@xcite at @xmath0 gev seemingly adds another supporting pillar to the theory of weak scale supersymmetry , since in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite we expect @xmath4 gev@xcite . aside from solving the gauge hierarchy problem , previous supporting pillars arising from data include 1 .",
    "the measured values of gauge couplings allow for gauge coupling unification at a scale @xmath5 gev within the mssm , 2 .",
    "the large value of the top quark mass is precisely what is needed to drive electroweak symmetry breaking via radiative corrections and 3 .",
    "susy is replete with several possible cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidates ( neutralino / wimp , gravitino , axino ) in the form of the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) .    since a variety of susy model parameters",
    "enter into the scalar potential of the theory , and thus contribute to the @xmath6 and higgs masses , it is widely expected that superpartners should exist at or around the weak scale .",
    "this mantra has been repeated in numerous talks and papers over the past decades , so we refer to it here as the story of susy electroweak naturalness .",
    "indeed , the concept of naturalness may dictate to some degree when it is time to give up on weak scale supersymmetry should no signal be ultimately found@xcite .    while the existence of a higgs - like scalar at @xmath7 gev is a boon for susy models , on the contrary",
    ", no signal for superpartners has yet emerged at lhc . in models such as the popular msugra / cmssm@xcite ,",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations@xcite now require @xmath8 tev for @xmath9 and @xmath10 tev for @xmath11 .",
    "already this fact has led some astute physicists to give up on weak scale susy@xcite , or to at least concede that weak scale susy is finetuned .",
    "thus , the recent lhc limits on sparticle masses seemingly exacerbate what is known as the little hierarchy problem ( lhp ) : why is there such a disparity between the sparticle mass scale and the electroweak scale ?    before jumping to conclusions , it pays to scrutinize electroweak naturalness more closely .",
    "we can be more precise if we re - phrase the lhp in the following terms : how is it that the @xmath12-boson mass can exist at just 91.2 gev while gluino and squark masses are at , or even well beyond , the tev scale ?",
    "the answer proposed in ref s",
    "@xcite is that all the individual _ weak scale _",
    "contributions feeding mass into @xmath13 should be not too far from @xmath13 .",
    "the value of @xmath13 in the mssm is given by = -^2-m_h_u^2-^2 [ eq : mz ] , where the latter approximate equality obtains for ratio - of - higgs vevs @xmath14 and where the @xmath15 and @xmath16 terms represent the sum of various radiative corrections@xcite .",
    "to be quantitative , a finetuning measure _ ew = max_i| c_i/(m_z^2/2 )  | may be defined , where @xmath17 represents any of the terms on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ eq : mz ] ( _ e.g. _ @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) . the finetuning measure @xmath20 enjoys several advantages as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : it is 1 .",
    "model - independent ( within the mssm ) in that any model giving rise to the same weak scale susy spectrum will have the same measure of finetuning , 2 .",
    "conservative , 3 .",
    "unambiguous , 4 . predictive , 5 .",
    "falsifiable and 6 .",
    "simple to encode .    in the 2-parameter non - universal higgs model ( nuhm2)@xcite , with parameter space given by m_0 ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  ,  ,  m_a ,",
    "scans have found that values of @xmath20 as low as @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 electroweak finetuning ) could be found@xcite . to achieve low @xmath20",
    ", one needs _ a _ ) @xmath23 gev , _ b _ ) @xmath24 so that @xmath25 is driven radiatively ( via the large top - quark yukawa coupling ) to small but negative values at the weak scale and _ c _ ) moderate values of @xmath26 tev .",
    "scalar masses may exist in the range 1 - 10 tev ( even higher if one allows for split generations ) although large trilinear soft breaking terms @xmath27 are required .",
    "the large @xmath28-terms yield large mixing in the top - squark sector which simultaneously softens the radiative corrections @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while lifting the value of @xmath31 into the 125 gev range@xcite .",
    "while the nuhm2 model admits values of @xmath20 even below 10 , the msugra / cmssm model is considerably more tuned , where a minimum @xmath32 has been found , although typically @xmath20 for msugra is more like @xmath33 .",
    "models with low @xmath34 have been dubbed _ radiative natural susy _",
    "( rns ) since the low electroweak finetuning is radiatively driven .",
    "the sparticle spectra found for rns models with @xmath34 is characterized by :    light higgsino - like @xmath35 and @xmath36 with masses @xmath37  gev ,    gluinos with mass @xmath38  tev ,    top squarks with @xmath39  tev and @xmath40  tev ,    first / second generation squarks and sleptons with masses @xmath41  tev .",
    "the @xmath42 range can be pushed up to 20 - 30  tev if non - universality of generations with @xmath43 is allowed . the rns model with the above spectra yields branching fractions @xmath44 and @xmath45 in accord with measured values , unlike many models with lighter top squarks@xcite .",
    "as far as testability goes , rns models should yield observable signals from gluino pair production at lhc14 with @xmath46 fb@xmath47 for @xmath48 tev@xcite .",
    "the lhc14 reach for ss diboson production from @xmath49 gives a reach in terms of @xmath50 of @xmath51 tev for the same integrated luminosity@xcite .",
    "since @xmath50 can range up to @xmath52 tev for the rns models , then lhc14 will not be able to definitively discover / exclude rns .",
    "alternatively , the hallmark distinction of rns models is the presence of four light higgsinos with masses @xmath37 gev .",
    "a linear @xmath53 collider operating at @xmath54 can definitively discover / exclude rns models , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath55 ( 1 ) tev would access all models with @xmath56 ( 70 ) . since the timescale for operation of a tev - scale ilc is of order 10 - 20 years , here we address instead the possibility of much earlier discovery of the higgsino - like wimps expected from rns models .",
    "in this paper , we generate rns models from the isasugra spectrum generator@xcite using the same nuhm2 parameter space scan as utilized in ref .",
    "we will require that the model generated from each parameter set obeys the lep2 bound that @xmath57 gev , and will focus on models with @xmath58 ( 100 ) corresponding to better than 2% ( 1% ) electroweak finetuning .",
    "we calculate the `` standard thermal neutralino abundance '' @xmath59 using the isared@xcite relic density subroutine .",
    "we will accept only models with @xmath60 for reasons to be made clear shortly .",
    "the relic abundance from rns models is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2 ] .",
    "the red crosses have @xmath58 whilst blue dots have @xmath61 .",
    "green points we will find later are already excluded by direct / indirect wimp search limits . from the figure",
    ", we see a high density band extending from @xmath62 for @xmath63 gev to @xmath64 for @xmath65 gev , _",
    "i.e. _ there is typically a standard _ underabundance _ of higgsino dark matter compared to measurement from wmap9@xcite by a factor ranging from 3 - 25 .",
    "there is some spread in these values above and below the main band from cases where @xmath66 is quite large and @xmath67 is small so that one has instead a mixed higgsino - bino lsp state .",
    "the bulk of points above the band are already excluded as we shall see .",
    "thus , the mainly higgsinolike neutralino by itself does not make a good cdm candidate .",
    "additional new physics is needed to match the measured dark matter density .     versus @xmath68 from a scan over nuhm2 parameter space with @xmath58 ( red crosses ) and @xmath61 ( blue dots ) .",
    "green points are excluded by current direct / indirect wimp search experiments .",
    "we also show the central value of @xmath69 from wmap9 .",
    "[ fig : oh2 ] ]    one compelling way to address the dark matter deficiency is by invoking the peccei - quinn - weinberg - wilczek solution to the strong cp problem@xcite via introduction of a pq symmetry and concommitant _",
    "axions_. since we are working in susy models , the axion will be accompanied by @xmath1-parity - even spin-0 saxions @xmath70 and @xmath1-parity - odd spin-@xmath71 axinos @xmath72@xcite . in gravity - mediation models ( as assumed here ) , the saxion and axino are expected to have masses @xmath73 tev@xcite , the same mass scale as matter scalars @xmath74 in the theory . in this case",
    ", the dark matter would consist of both axions and higgsinos acting as co - dark matter particles .",
    "the relic abundance of mixed axion - neutralino cdm has been addressed in ref s  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was found that susy models with a standard overabundance of dark matter are _ still excluded _ in the pqmssm by a combination of dark matter overabundance constraints , bbn constraints and dark radiation constraints .",
    "however , susy models with a standard underabundance of neutralinos are still allowed over large ranges of pqmssm parameters . for models with a standard underabundance ,",
    "then thermal production and decay of axinos in the early universe augments the neutralino abundance , sometimes by too much , other times not enough : the former case would be excluded whilst in the latter case , the remaining abundance is made up of relic axions produced through the usual vacuum misalignment mechanism .",
    "in addition , for large values of pq breaking scale @xmath75 gev , then saxions can be produced at large rates via coherent oscillations .",
    "the saxions can augment the neutralino abundance by decaying to susy particles ( _ e.g. _ @xmath76 ) , or they can dilute all relics if they decay after freezeout into sm particles .",
    "saxions may also decay into axion pairs @xmath77 leading to production of dark radiation@xcite . from the pqmssm scans in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that in the case where @xmath77 branching fraction is at all substantial , then entropy dilution is _ always _ accompanied by a violation of either bbn or dark radiation constraints ( parametrized by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the effective number of additional neutrinos beyond the sm value ) .",
    "thus , the scans over pqmssm parameter space in ref .",
    "@xcite find that the standard underabundance can be augmented by any factor leading to @xmath80 , but not diminished without violating bbn or dr constraints .",
    "models with too much cdm production , or models which violate bbn or dark radiation constraints would be excluded .",
    "the upshot is that in rns models , for any particular parameter set , we expect the relic higgsino abundance to lie somewhere between the standard value @xmath59 ( which would correspond to axion domination ) up to the measured value @xmath81 , in which case cdm would be higgsino - dominated .",
    "the question then arises : what are the prospects for direct / indirect detection of relic higgsinos in wimp detection experiments ?    in fig .",
    "[ fig : si ] , we show the spin - independent higgsino - proton scattering rate in @xmath82 as calculated using isares@xcite",
    ". the result is rescaled by a factor @xmath83 to account for the fact that the local relic abundance might be far less than the usually assumed value @xmath84 gev/@xmath85 , as suggested long ago by bottino _ et al._@xcite ( the remainder would be composed of axions ) .",
    "the higgsino - like wimp in our case scatters from quarks and gluons mainly via @xmath86 exchange .",
    "the @xmath87 coupling involves a product of both higgsino and gaugino components . in the case of rns models",
    ", the @xmath88 is mainly higgsino - like , but since @xmath67 is bounded from above by naturalness , the @xmath88 contains enough gaugino component that the coupling is never small : in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite -x_11^h _ 1 _ 1 h where x_11^h = -12(v_2^(1)-v_1^(1 ) ) ( gv_3^(1)-gv_4^(1 ) ) , and where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the higgsino components and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the gaugino components of the lightest neutralino , @xmath93 is the higgs mixing angle and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are @xmath96 and @xmath97 gauge couplings .",
    "thus , for susy models with low @xmath98 , the si direct detection cross section is also bounded from below , even including the rescaling factor @xmath99 .    from the figure",
    ", we see that the current reach from 225 live - days of xe-100 running@xcite already bites into a significant spread of parameter points .",
    "the excluded points are colored green .",
    "the projected reach of the lux 300 kg detector@xcite is also shown by the black - dashed contour , which should explore roughly half the allowed rns points .",
    "the reach of supercdms 150 kg detector@xcite is shown as the purple - dashed contour .",
    "the projected reach of xe-1-ton , a ton scale liquid xenon detector , is also shown@xcite .",
    "our main result is this : the projected xe-1-ton detector , or other comparable noble liquid detectors , can make a _ complete _ exploration of the rns parameter space . since deployment of the xe-1-ton detector is imminent , it seems direct wimp search experiments may either verify or exclude rns models in the near future , thus bringing the story of electroweak naturalness to a conclusion !     versus @xmath68 from a scan over nuhm2 parameter space with @xmath58 ( red crosses ) and @xmath61 ( blue dots ) .",
    "green points are excluded by current direct / indirect wimp search experiments .",
    "we also show the current reach from @xmath100 - 100 experiment , and projected reaches of lux , supercdms 150 kg and @xmath100 - 1 ton .",
    "[ fig : si ] ]    while the above result is indeed compelling , it is not a theorem , and is subject to several reasonable assumptions .",
    "these include the assumption of @xmath1-parity conservation with a higgsino - like co - dm particle , along with the assumption of non - negligible @xmath77 decay rate . if the @xmath77 decay rate is somehow forbidden or highly suppressed , then @xmath101 ( gluons ) may be dominant , in which case substantial entropy dilution can still occur@xcite .    an alternative method for rescuing theories with an underabundance of wimps is to hypothesize the existence of some scalar field ( such as a modulus field from string theory ) which can be produced via coherent oscillations , and which can engage in late decays injecting either more wimps ( thus increasing the wimp abundance ) or entropy ( thus decreasing the abundance@xcite ) .",
    "the resulting abundance just depends on two parameters : the scalar field decay temperature and the branching fraction into susy particles@xcite . in our case , with a higgsino - like wimp underabundance , the decaying scalar field would increase the higgsino abundance to its measured value , and the rescaling factor @xmath102 . for this possibility , the results of ref",

    "in conclusion , we have found that susy models can elude the little hierarchy problem in the guise of radiative natural susy models which feature a mainly higgsino - like neutralino that may act as a co - dark - matter particle along with the axion .",
    "while lhc can explore a portion of rns parameter space , an ilc can probe it entirely , although such a machine may be well over a decade in the future .",
    "however , current wimp direct detection experiments are biting into the meat of rns parameter space , even if we take into account rescaling of the local abundance due to the fact that higgsinos may make up only a portion of the dark matter .",
    "lux and ultimately supercdms will probe further .",
    "the soon - to - be - deployed xe-1-ton noble liquid detector should be able to _ completely _ explore the entire rns parameter space ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si ] ) , thus either discovering a higgsino - like wimp or rejecting the story of susy electroweak naturalness .",
    "complementary signals from spin - dependent and indirect wimp detection channels are less likely since these are usually suppressed by the reduced local wimp density which is expected from models of mixed dark matter .",

    "<S> supersymmetric models which fulfill the conditions of electroweak naturalness generally contain light higgsinos with mass not too far from @xmath0 gev , while other sparticles can be much heavier . in @xmath1-parity </S>",
    "<S> conserving models , the lightest neutralino is then a higgsino - like wimp ( albeit with non - negligible gaugino components ) , with thermal relic density well below measured values . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves room for axions to function as co - dark matter particles . the local wimp abundance is then expected to be below standard estimates , and direct and indirect detection rates must be accordingly rescaled . </S>",

    "<S> , we find that ton - scale noble liquid detectors can probe the entire higgsino - like wimp parameter space , so that these experiments should either discover wimps or exclude the concept of electroweak naturalness in @xmath1-parity conserving natural susy models . </S>",
