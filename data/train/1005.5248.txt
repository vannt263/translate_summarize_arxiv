    "main role in the physics of the kondo lattices @xcite belongs to the interplay of the on - site kondo screening and intersite exchange interactions .",
    "following to doniach criterion @xcite , it was believed in early works @xcite that the total suppression of either magnetic moments or the kondo anomalies takes place .",
    "however , later experimental data and theoretical investigations made clear that the kondo lattices as a rule demonstrate magnetic ordering or are close to this .",
    "this concept was consistently formulated and justified in a series of the papers @xcite treating the mutual renormalization of two characteristic energy scales : the kondo temperature @xmath1 and spin - fluctuation frequency @xmath2 . a simple scaling consideration of this renormalization process in the @xmath3 exchange model @xcite yields , depending on the values of bare parameters , both the usual  states ( a non - magnetic kondo lattice or a magnetic state with weak kondo corrections ) and the peculiar magnetic kondo - lattice state . in the latter regime",
    ", small variations of parameters result in strong changes of the ground - state moment .",
    "thereby high sensitivity of the ground - state moment to external factors like pressure and doping by a small amount of impurities ( a characteristic feature of heavy fermion magnets ) is naturally explained .    during 1990s ,",

    "these systems possess unusual logarithmic or power - law temperature dependences of electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "various mechanisms were proposed to describe the nfl behavior @xcite , including two - channel kondo scattering @xcite , `` griffiths singularities '' in disordered magnets @xcite , strong spin fluctuations near a quantum magnetic phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is important that experimentally the nfl behavior ( as well as heavy - fermion behavior ) is typical for systems lying on the boundary of magnetic ordering and demonstrating strong spin fluctuations @xcite .",

    "in particular , for the logarithmically divergent density of states@xmath17(the energy is referred to the fermi level , @xmath18 is the half - bandwidth , the constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined by the band spectrum ) the kondo singularities at @xmath21 become double - logarithmic .",

    "now we have a two - stage renormalization .",
    "one can see that the well - linear coherent  behavior region ( which is rather narrow in fig.6 ) is changed by a pm - like quasi - linear  behavior ( [ lina ] ) with increasing @xmath194 this crossover occurs when the function @xmath195 reaches its maximum value at the singularity ( cf .",

    "the quasi - linear  behavior , although being somewhat smeared , is pronounced in a considerable region of @xmath196 even for not too small @xmath197 .",

    "in the general problem of metallic magnetism , the peaks in the bare density of states ( which are usually connected with vhs ) near the fermi level play a crucial role .",

    "the corresponding dependences @xmath202 describe an analogue of the temperature - induced magnetism  mor .",
    "such a picture is based on the many - electron renormalization ( compensation ) of localized magnetic moments and differs outwardly from the ordinary mechanism for weak itinerant ferromagnets with small @xmath203 which are assumed to correspond to the immediate vicinity of the stoner instability .    however , the physical difference is not radical .",
    "in fact , a continuous transition exists between the highly - correlated kondo lattices and the usual  itinerant - electron systems .",
    "in particular , one may view pauli paramagnets as systems with high @xmath131 of order of the fermi energy ; for enhanced pauli paramagnets like pd , pt , ual@xmath204 , where the curie - weiss holds at high temperatures , one introduces instead of the kondo temperature the so - called spin - fluctuation temperature .",
    "a combined description of the kondo lattice state and weak itinerant magnetism has been considered recently by ohkawa @xcite .",
    "remember that the kondo systems with vhs near the fermi level under consideration just possess high values of @xmath131 ( see the introduction ) .    in this context , it would be instructive to describe weak itinerant magnets not from the band  point of view , but from the side of local magnetic moments which are nearly compensated . since a number of cerium nfl systems demonstrate itinerant - electron behavior @xcite and it is customary now to treat upt@xmath6 , cesi@xmath4 and cerh@xmath6b@xmath12 as weak itinerant magnets , the second approach appears already by far less natural than the first ( see refs.@xcite ) . from the formal point of view , perturbation calculations in the hubbard model , which describes itinerant - electron systems , are similar to those in the @xmath27 model , provided that one postulates the existence of local moments .",
    "besides that , for two - dimensional itinerant systems with strong spin fluctuations the semiphenomenological spin - fermion model can be used which separates electron and spin degrees of freedom and is somewhat similar to @xmath205 exchange model @xcite .    further on , the question arises about the role which many - electron effects play in the classical  weak itinerant 3d magnets like zrzn@xmath206 and tibe@xmath12 .",
    "indeed , one can hardly believe that the extremal smallness of @xmath80 in these systems is due to accidental bare values of @xmath207 and stoner parameter . moreover , the stoner criterion is not valid even qualitatively ( in particular , due to spin fluctuations the critical coupling @xmath208 in the hubbard model is finite when the fermi level tends to vhs @xcite ) .",
    "thus a scaling consideration in the presence of vhs would be of interest , especially with account of chemical potential renormalizations ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in particular , owing to vhs the chemical potential can depend weakly on electron concentration ( the pinning phenomenon @xcite ) . in the kondo systems",
    "such a treatment may lead to a renormalization of the scale @xmath197 itself .",
    "now we discuss some real layered systems .",
    "specific heat is considerably enhanced in ruthenates sr@xmath12ruo@xmath209 a gradual enhancement of the electronic specific heat and a more drastic increase of the static magnetic susceptibility were observed in sr@xmath210la@xmath211ruo@xmath16 with increasing @xmath212 .",
    "furthermore , the quasi-2d fermi - liquid behavior observed in pure sr@xmath12ruo@xmath16 breaks down near the critical value @xmath213 .",
    "the enhancement of the density of states can be ascribed to the elevation of the fermi energy toward a van hove singularity of the thermodynamically dominant fermi - surface sheet .",
    "the nfl behavior is attributed to two - dimensional fm fluctuations with short - range correlations at vhs @xcite .",
    "the bilayered ruthenate system sr@xmath6ru@xmath12o@xmath14 in the ground state is a paramagnetic fermi liquid with strongly enhanced quasiparticle masses .",
    "the fermi - liquid region of the phase diagram extends up to 10 - 15 k in zero field and is continuously suppressed towards zero temperature upon approaching the critical field of @xmath214 t . in the vicinity of the putative quantum critical end point , nfl behavior has been observed in various macroscopic quantities including specific heat , resistivity and thermal expansion and has been described on the basis of phenomenological models @xcite .",
    "we can mention also some layered @xmath0-systems .",
    "the layered kondo lattice model was proposed for quantum critical beta - ybalb@xmath16 where two - dimensional boron layers are kondo coupled via interlayer yb moments @xcite .",
    "cerupo seems to be one of the rare examples of a ferromagnetic kondo lattice where lsda+u calculations evidence a quasi-2d electronic band structure , reflecting a strong covalent bonding within the ceo and rup layers and a weak ioniclike bonding between the layers cerupo .    to describe layered antiferromagnetic cuprates ,",
    "the 2d @xmath215 hubbard model is often used which also describes fermi - liquid and nfl regimes . despite the density - of - state logarithmic singularity ,",
    "the staggered spin susceptibility in this model does not diverge within the fermi - liquid approach , the reason being the appearance of the logarithmic singularity in the quasiparticle mass @xcite .",
    "the effective mass renormalization is beyond our lowest - order ( one - loop ) scaling consideration , but may play a role at an accurate treatment .",
    "the two - loop considerations of the flat - fermi - surface and @xmath215 hubbard models @xcite yield an ( generally speaking , anisotropic ) suppression of the quasiparticle weight ( inverse effective mass ) along the fermi surface , the staggered spin susceptibility remaining divergent , although the divergence is considerable weakened .",
    "note that the picture in the hubbard model and @xmath27 model ( where `` direct '' exchange interaction is present ) can be considerably different .",
    "recently , the @xmath216-expansion has been used for a scaling consideration of the 2d antiferromagnetic kondo lattice with the use of non - linear sigma model @xcite .    in the case of a smooth electron density of states , various physical properties of nfl systems",
    "are discussed within our approach in ref .",
    "the temperature behavior of magnetic characteristics @xmath80 and @xmath2 , which depend exponentially on the coupling constant , is decisive for the nfl picture under consideration . at the same time , the presence of vhs near the fermi level influences strongly all the electronic , magnetic and transport properties in the scaling approach , as well as in the one - electron theory .",
    "the replacement @xmath217 with @xmath218 being considerably temperature dependent owing to vhs may modify somewhat the behavior of observable quantities .",
    "consider the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath219 .",
    "using the scaling arguments we can replace @xmath220 @xmath221 with @xmath222 which yields @xmath223 .",
    "the non - universal exponent @xmath224 is determined by details of magnetic structure ( the difference @xmath225 can be used as a perturbations , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . besides that",
    ", a number of crossovers are characteristic for nfl behavior under consideration . in the coherent magnon  regime",
    "we have @xmath226 and in the quasilinear(incoherent ) region @xmath227 .",
    "the temperature dependence of electronic specific heat can be estimated from the second - order perturbation theory , @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the residue of the one - electron green s function at the distance @xmath230 from the fermi level .",
    "then we have @xmath231which results in a non - trivial behavior of the wilson ratio .",
    "following to ref.@xcite , a simple estimation of the transport relaxation rate ( which determines the temperature dependence of the resistivity owing to scattering by spin fluctuations in afm phase ) yields @xmath232 however , a more refined treatment in spirit of ref.@xcite would be useful in some cases .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a mechanism of nfl behavior owing to peculiar behavior of spin spectral function was proposed .",
    "here we treated a similar , but somewhat more simple and natural mechanism which is connected with the singularities in the bare electron spectrum .",
    "of course , a more accurate treatment of magnetic fluctuations near the quantum phase transition is required .",
    "therefore detailed investigations of the nfl behavior for a realistic fermi surface and spin spectral function are of interest .",
    "an accurate investigation of the situation where vhs is shifted from @xmath21 or two peaks are present below and above @xmath21 @xcite would be also instructive .",
