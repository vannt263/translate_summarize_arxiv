    "the double - charmonium production in @xmath3 annihilation at the b factory provides a good platform to study both perturbative and non - perturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "on one hand , from the experimental point of view , the cross section of the precess @xmath4 was measured at belle @xcite and babar @xcite , and their recent observation show that @xcite @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the branching fraction for the final states with more than two charged tracks .    on the other hand , from the theoretical point of view , the process @xmath4 is usually studied within the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite . under the leading order ( lo ) nrqcd calculation",
    ", refs.@xcite derived a much smaller cross section @xmath8 for the first time .",
    "thus there are large discrepancy between theoretical predictions of the lo nrqcd calculation and the experimental measurements . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "many attempts were made based on the nrqcd approach .",
    "refs.@xcite diminished the disagreement to a large degree by including the radiative correction .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in refs.@xcite , the relativistic corrections can further improve the accuracy . by taking both the radiative and relativistic corrections into account , ref.@xcite got @xmath9 , then the authors there optimistically concluded that the disagreement between theoretical predictions in nrqcd approach and experiments has been resolved @xcite .",
    "however , one may doubt the validity of the @xmath10- and @xmath11- expansion in the process @xmath4 , if the lo result is an order of magnitude smaller than the experimental measurements and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections / higher @xmath11-expansion terms inversely play a dominate role for the double charmonium production . furthermore , ref.@xcite showed that the scale dependence of the cross section can not be improved even with the nlo correction , so it is an important matter to determine the typical scale of the process or at least to make a more reliable estimation of scale dependence .",
    "in contrast , it was argued that the experimental results by belle and babar collaborations of the process @xmath12 can also be explained by using the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) with proper models for the charmonium distribution amplitudes ( da ) @xcite .",
    "they claimed ,  the difficulties in explaining the belle and babar results for @xmath13 are not really the difficulties of qcd , but are rather due to a poor approximation of the real dynamics of @xmath14-quarks by nrqcd \" .",
    "actually , the exclusive process can be factorized into two parts in the pqcd approach : the calculable hard - parton amplitude and the hadronic distribution amplitude .",
    "if one replaces all das in the pqcd formulae by a simple @xmath15 function , the calculated cross section will be back to a few @xmath16 that is consistent with the nrqcd approach .",
    "however one always assume that the hadronic distribution amplitude is not non - relativistic . therefore , the key point is that the relativistic da , instead of the @xmath15 function , enhances the cross section of the process @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , since the qcd light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) combines the qcd sum rules and the pqcd theory of hard exclusive processes in a suitable way , it can be a good tool for calculating the form factors in the large momentum transfer .",
    "for example , lcsr is a successful method for dealing with the @xmath17 transition form factor @xcite that is similar to the process @xmath4 .",
    "we shall try to apply the qcd lcsr approach to calculate the amplitude of the process @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the theoretical predictions at the lo approximation for the cross section of the process @xmath18 at the large energy scale can be obtained by using the qcd lcsr .",
    "similar to the pqcd approach , this method also faces two problems : which charmonium da model should be adopted and how large effects can be determined by the da evolution . in the present paper , we shall discuss the behavior of the different models for the charmonium da and the effects of the renormalized group evolution with the effective scale in the process .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present calculation technology for @xmath12 under the qcd lcsr , where the leading - twist da is constructed and its qcd evolution is presented .",
    "numerical results for the cross section of the process @xmath12 are presented in sec .",
    "the final section is reserved for summary and conclusion .",
    "generally , the cross section for the process @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 stand for the four - momentum of initial and final particles correspondingly , @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the squared absolute value of the matrix element , where the color states and spin projections of the initial and final particles have been summed up and those of the initial particles have been averaged .    for the exclusive double - charmonium production @xmath4",
    ", its lorentz - invariant matrix element turns out to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath14-quark electromagnetic current .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the scattering angle , @xmath31 is the charm quark charge and the form factor @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the polarization vector of @xmath35-meson and @xmath36 . neglecting the small mass difference between @xmath35 and @xmath2 mesons , the cross section becomes @xmath37    it is shown that the main part is to calculate the form factor @xmath32 .",
    "there are many methods to calculate it , such as nrqcd @xcite , pqcd @xcite and light - cone perturbative qcd approaches @xcite .",
    "here we use the lcsr approach @xcite to calculate @xmath32 .",
    "we adopt the following two - point correlator to calculate the form factor @xmath32 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the four - momentum of the virtual photon , @xmath40 is the four - momentum of @xmath2 meson .    on one hand , by inserting a complete set of intermediate hadronic states in eq.([eq : pimunu ] ) , we get @xmath41 where the decay constant @xmath42 is defined as , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the polarization vector of @xmath35-meson .",
    "@xmath45 is the threshold parameter whose value can be taken as @xmath46 @xcite . the second term in eq.([eq : completation ] )",
    "is the dispersion integral that includes the contributions from the excited and continuum states in the region @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , the correlation function eq.([eq : pimunu ] ) can also be calculated by expanding the @xmath48-product of quark currents near the light cone @xmath49 due to sufficiently large momentum transfer . for such purpose , we contract the two @xmath14-quark fields and write down a free @xmath14-quark propagator @xmath50 then up to twist-3 accuracy , eq.([eq : pimunu ] ) can be simplified as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the current @xmath14-quark mass , @xmath53 is the decay constant of @xmath54 meson , @xmath55 stands for the @xmath2 leading - twist da that is defined through the matrix element : @xmath56    next , by applying the quark - hadron duality to eq.([eq : completation ] ) and by applying the borel transformation @xcite @xmath57\\right\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to eq.([eq : completation ] ) and eq.([eq : piqcd ] ) , we obtain the sum rule for @xmath32 @xmath58 + \\frac{m_{j/\\psi}^2}{m^2}\\right\\ } } , \\label{eq : fvp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 \\label{eq : delta}$ ] , @xmath60 is the borel transformation parameter and @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "it is found that the form factor @xmath32 depends heavily on the da @xmath55 , especially on its end point behavior due to @xmath63 .",
    "the key input for the form factor is the gauge - independent and process - independent da @xmath55 , which is of non - perturbative nature and can be defined as the integral of the valence fock wave function @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for the separation scale between the perturbative and non - perturbative regions . as for a scale @xmath66 , the non - perturbative da @xmath67",
    "is given by the renormalization group evolution that can be calculated perturbatively .",
    ".the explicit form of the spin - space wave function @xmath68 , where the transverse momentum @xmath69 and @xmath70 stands for the constituent @xmath14-quark mass . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is found that the cross section depends on the da in the region @xmath71 through the form factor formula ( [ eq : fvp ] ) .",
    "we show the cross section corresponding to three typical scales @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 in fig.([fig4 ] ) .",
    "when the effective energy scale increases , the corresponding cross section becomes bigger and is compatible with the babar and belle s measurements .",
    "thus , by setting the effective energy scale and dealing with the da evolution properly , the lcsr can provide a possible explanation for the double - charmonium production process @xmath12 at the b factory . to explicate the cross sections of different models numerically",
    ", we further show these cross sections in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] , where the error is caused by the variation of @xmath60 .",
    "one may observe that the cross section by bll model is smaller than that by bhl model since the da of the bll model is narrower than that of the bhl model as shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "the above calculation is done at the lo approximation within the qcd lcsr and the error is only caused by the variation of the borel parameter @xmath60 . of course",
    ", one should include the higher order contributions , such as the nlo corrections to the light - cone sum rules , the higher - twist das , the higher fock states and etc .",
    "therefore we can not estimate all of the uncertainties of the calculated cross section before doing a further study .",
    "the exclusive charmonium @xmath75 production in @xmath3 collision is a very interesting problem . since the discrepancy between theoretical prediction of the",
    "lo nrqcd and experimental data given by belle and babar at the b factory has posed a significant challenge for several years , many theoretical attempts have been made to solve this challenging problem .",
    "it is worthwhile to study this process by taking various applicable approaches to understand the charmonium production dynamics . in this paper",
    "we study this process by using the qcd lcsr approach .",
    "our results based on the lcsr approach shows that the cross section of the process @xmath4 substantially depends on the behavior of the @xmath2 da at the energy scale @xmath76 . noticing that the energy scale @xmath76 at the b factory is greater than the initial scale @xmath65 of the @xmath2 da , the renormalization group evolution of the da has to be taken into account .",
    "the perturbative radiative correction leads to a big change of the da especially to the tail of the da at the large scale @xmath76 .    at the present",
    ", one has poor knowledge of the da and tries to build various models that have quite different behavior , especially at the end - point region .",
    "we stress that the evolution of the @xmath2 da can give more reasonable prediction to the process @xmath4 within the lcsr approach .",
    "similar to other approaches , in order to calculate the cross section of the double - charmonium production one needs to have more knowledge of the charmonium da .",
    "the numerical results show that the cross section of the process @xmath4 is predicted in the range @xmath77 .",
    "the calculated values for the different models can be compatible with the belle and babar measurements by properly choosing effective energy scale for this process and dealing with the da evolution effect .",
