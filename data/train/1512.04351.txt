    "laser operation is usually achieved through three basic elements : an amplifying medium , an external pumping setup , and an optical cavity that confines and shapes the emitted light in well - determined modes and directions .",
    "however , several modern approaches are extending this traditional laser paradigm into new avenues .",
    "for instance , the fastly developing fiber - laser technology replaces the optical cavity with photonic fibers , thus enabling large average powers and very high beam qualities @xcite .",
    "additionally , the advent of nano - plasmonic materials has prompted the demonstration of plasmon stimulated emission in metallic nanoparticles @xcite and waveguides embedding gaining media @xcite , which enable lasing of sub - wavelength beams . in a complementary direction , light amplification has been achieved in artificially engineered materials ",
    "metamaterials  that hold promise as planar sources of spatially and temporally coherent radiation @xcite , for compensating losses in negative - index media @xcite , and for achieving cavity - free lasing in the stopped - light regime @xcite .",
    "cavity - free stimulated emission of radiation has been widely studied in random lasers ( rls ) @xcite , where the optical cavity modes of traditional lasers are replaced with multiple scattering in disordered media , while the interplay between gain and scattering determines the lasing properties .",
    "the physics behind rls is rich and involved , as multiple scattering of light in disordered media leads to very complex electromagnetic mode structures .",
    "indeed , rl emission is typically highly multi - mode owing to the co - existence of narrowly confined modes ensuing from anderson localization ( al ) @xcite and extended modes @xcite .",
    "interestingly , light acquires a glassy behavior in rls since nonlinear dynamics involves a replica - symmetry breaking phase transition @xcite .",
    "additionally , dispersing plasmonic nanoparticles in rls enables the control of lasing resonances @xcite and coherent feedback @xcite . in spite of their striking potential applications , rls lack external tunability , reproducibility , and control over the spatial pattern of the output beam .",
    "overcoming these limitations is central for the development and application of cost - effective cavity - free lasers .    inspired by the aforementioned challenges , here we investigate the optical properties of randomly - oriented undoped graphene flakes embedded in externally pumped amplifying media .",
    "we demonstrate a novel mechanism leading to stable and tunable single - mode cavity - free lasing characterized by a well - determined and highly coherent spatial pattern .",
    "we find that the transverse size of the localized output beam , ranging from a few to several hundreds microns , can be accurately manipulated through the external pumping and through the volume density of graphene flakes .",
    "this cavity - free lasing mechanism profoundly relies on the extraordinary optical properties of graphene @xcite , which has already been employed in photonics for ultrafast photodetectors @xcite , optical modulation @xcite , molecular sensing @xcite , and several nonlinear applications @xcite .",
    "graphene s salient feature underpinning cavity - free lasing ensues from its highly - saturated absorption at rather modest light intensities @xcite , a remarkable property which has already been exploited for mode - locking in ultrafast fiber - lasers @xcite .",
    "for our proof - of - concept , we consider a disordered medium composed of undoped graphene flakes and rhodamine 6 g ( r6 g ) dyes dispersed in polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) , as schematically depicted in fig . [",

    "graphene is routinely exfoliated from graphite and dispersed in several solutions including dimethylformamide ( dmf ) , which can be also used to dissolve r6 g and pmma .",
    "we remark that the practical fabrication of such disordered medium does not involve advanced nano - fabrication techniques . for simplicity , we assume that the graphene flakes are disks with volume density @xmath0 and diameter @xmath1 nm , for which quantum many - body and finite - size effects are negligible @xcite .",
    "r6 g constitutes the optically amplifying medium , in which population inversion can be achieved through a frequency - doubled nd - yag laser - pump beam at wavelength @xmath2 nm .",
    "the aimed wavelength of laser operation is @xmath3 nm , where r6 g has its peak emission . under these conditions ,",
    "graphene flakes are much smaller than the optical wavelength and multiple scattering , which occurs in the quasi - static regime , is captured by the effective permittivity of the composite material . to place this in context , typical rls also work with r6 g dispersed in pmma @xcite , but in contrast",

    "the conical band structure of undoped graphene around the dirac points [ see fig . [ fig2].(a ) ] is responsible for its unique properties .",

[ fig2].(a ) ] . in simple terms , in the strong - field regime , electron - hole recombination produced by electron collisions can balance light - induced interband absorption , which is in turn partially inhibited by pauli blocking of out - of - equilibrium electrons in the conduction band [ see fig .
