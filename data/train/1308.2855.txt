    "the mega - ampere spherical tokamak ( mast)@xcite has demonstrated promising confinement scalings while operating at higher equilibrium plasma-@xmath1 values than conventional tokamaks . it has been suggested that the spherical tokamak ( st ) magnetic confinement concept should be developed further , towards a st power plant  @xcite or st based component test facility ( ctf)@xcite . in these machines significant neutron shielding would be required for the toroidal field coils at the central column , leaving little space for a central solenoid .",
    "an attractive option is to remove the central solenoid and to achieve plasma formation and current drive through other methods . towards this goal",
    "several non - solenoidal start - up methods have been investigated on a number of devices , including the use of radio - frequency waves  @xcite , co - axial and dc helicity injection  @xcite , and flux - rope merging start - up via poloidal field coil induction  @xcite .",
    "the merging - compression start - up method , first performed on the small tight aspect ratio tokamak  @xcite , is now routinely used on mast  @xcite . after gas filling and ramp - up of currents in toroidal and poloidal field coils , to supply the vacuum field , the current in the pair of p3 poloidal field coils ( see figure  [ fig : cartoon1 ] )",
    "is ramped back down towards zero on a millisecond timescale .",
    "this causes breakdown and induces toroidal current rings , or co - helicity flux - ropes , in the plasma surrounding the p3 coils .",
    "when the parallel toroidal plasma current within the flux - ropes becomes greater than the current in the respective p3 coils , the mutual attraction between the flux - ropes causes them to detach from the coils and move towards the midplane of the vessel , where they merge together to form a single st plasma .",

    "it is also thought to be an important process for topological relaxation of magnetic fields in pulsars , the solar dynamo and laboratory plasma devices@xcite .",
    "there are a number of dedicated magnetic reconnection experiments currently under operation  @xcite and progress has been made in validating theoretical models against laboratory data .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed to model these experiments using fluid  @xcite and particle - in - cell models  @xcite .",
    "these simulations include the coupling of the reconnection layer to the inductive coils , or to an ideal instability that drives the reconnection .",
    "some also include the effects of the specific vessel geometry on the merging .",
    "it is clear from these studies that both of these effects are necessary to properly model the reconnection physics and to help interpret the experimental data .",
