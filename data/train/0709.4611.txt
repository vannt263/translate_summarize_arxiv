    "systems with defects and impurities are prevalent in nature .",
    "many theoretical studies are dedicated to various models with defects starting from classical and semiclassical to quantum as well as statistical models @xcite , with several of them devoted exclusively to the sine - gordon ( sg ) model with defect ( dsg ) dsg or inhomogeneity msgi , which have enhanced physical importance msgni1,msgni2 .",
    "a specific form of dsg model with a defect at a single point @xmath2 : u^_tt - u^_xx+ sin u^=0 ,   u^+=u(x 0,t ) ,  u^-= u(x 0,t ) ) , exhibiting intriguing properties close to integrable systems was investigated in a series of papers dsg , qdsg .",
    "these investigations aimed to find out mainly the additional contribution of the defect point to the conserved hamiltonian and momentum of the system , using the lagrangian formalism and the effect of the defect point on the soliton solution using the scattering theory . though the studies were concentrated basically on the classical aspects of this model , some semiclassical and quantum arguments were also put forward qdsg .",
    "the important central idea of this approach is the existence of an auto bcklund transformation ( bt ) frozen at the defect point @xmath2 , relating two solutions @xmath3 of the sg equation along the positive and negative semi - axis dsg , qdsg .",
    "our aim here is to establish the suspected integrability of the above dsg dsg , by showing the existence of infinite set of its conserved quantities and finding them explicitly .",
    "the idea is to adopt the monodromy matrix approach expressed through matrix riccati equation ft , a true signature of the integrable systems olit , and couple it with the important concept of extending the domain of defect fields @xmath3 through bt emihab .",
    "this approach yields apart from finding out systematically the defect - contribution for all higher conserved quantities , an intriguing possibility of creation or annihilation of soliton by the defect point .",
    "more significantly , exploiting the ancestor model approach of kunprl we find an exact lattice regularized version of the dsg model by using the realizations of the underlying algebra .",
    "this allows to solve the long awaiting problem of establishing the complete integrability of this model , by finding the classical and the quantum r - matrix solutions and showing the exact solvability of the classical and quantum yang - baxter equations ( ybe ) .",
    "the exact algebraic bethe ansatz solution can also be formulated for the quantum dsg model , though its explicit resolution needs further study .",
    "we focus on the central idea in dsg model ( [ dsg ] ) of gluing its fields @xmath3 across the defect point through the bt as u_x^+(x,0)=u_t^-(x,0)+p(x)+q(x ) , u_t^+(x,0)=u_x^-(x,0)+p(x)-q(x ) where p(x)=a ,  q = a^-1 . with parameter @xmath4 signifying the intensity of the defect . however , we would like to stress on an important conceptual difference in the role of bt ( [ btgx ] , [ pqgx ] ) played in the present approach and that in the previous studies dsg , qdsg , where the above bt was considered to be _ frozen _ at the defect point @xmath5 , and hence playing no role at any other point : @xmath6 . therefore , since the solutions @xmath7 can not be related through bt at other points along the axis , soliton number remains unchanged while moving across the defect point qdsg .",
    "we on the other hand implement here the idea of emihab used in the semi - axis sg model , where the domain of the field is extended with the application of bt . therefore in place",
    "of a frozen bt we use ( [ btgx ] ) effectively at all points of the axis including the defect in the following sense .",
    "define a solution of the sg equation with rapidly decreasing initial data @xmath8 satisfying the gluing conditions ( [ btgx ] ) and having the limits @xmath9 .",
    "this field solution of the sg equation allows to extend the pair of functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 smoothly from the left half - line @xmath12 onto the whole line using the bt ( [ btgx ] ) with a limiting value at the positive infinity @xmath13 : @xmath14 with an integer @xmath15 .",
    "following emihab one can prove also the existence and uniqueness of such an extension .",
    "similarly one can prolong the other pair of functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 from the right half - line to the whole line by means of the same bt and get @xmath18 , at @xmath19 , @xmath20 being another integer .",
    "now one has two potentials @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 related to each other by the bt .",
    "if the function @xmath21 satisfies the dsg equation then the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 solve the usual sg equation .",
    "however in the context of the dsg which is the focus model here , such extensions can be considered to be virtual and used for mathematical manipulations , while the physically observable fields are only @xmath24 in the domain @xmath25 and similarly @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "therefore any solution @xmath24 moving from the left along the axis @xmath28 would be transformed after crossing the defect at @xmath2 to a solution @xmath26 in the region @xmath29 , determined through the relations ( [ btgx ] ) .",
    "therefore , as we see below , it opens up the possibility of creation or annihilation of soliton by the defect point , which was prohibited in earlier studies due to consideration of a frozen bt relation qdsg .",
    "apart from these solutions , a single soliton suffering a phase shift , while propagating across the defect point , as found earlier dsg , qdsg , seems also to be present .",
    "interestingly , the bt expressed through scalar relations ( [ btgx ] ) can be incorporated more efficiently into the machinery of integrable systems by representing it as a gauge transformation relating the lax pairs of the dsg : u(u^+)=f^0u(u^-)(f^0)^-1 + f^0_x(f^0)^-1 ,  v(u^+)=f^0v(u^-)(f^0)^-1 + f^0_t(f^0)^-1 where @xmath30 is the bcklund matrix ( bm ) f^0(,u^+ , u^- ) = e^- i 4_3 u^- m ( , a ) e^ i 4 _ 3 u^+ ,  m ( , a)= (    c  a + -a     ) , involving both fields @xmath3 and bridging between them at all points , including the defect point @xmath31 .",
    "we can check directly from the matrix bt relations ( [ btgt ] ) that by inserting the explicit form of sg lax operators olit :  u = 1 4i ( u_t _ 3 + k_1 _ 2 + k_0 _ 1 ) ,   v= 1 4i ( u_x _ 3 + k_0 _ 2 + k_1 _ 1 ) , where @xmath32 with spectral parameter @xmath33 , and comparing the matrix elements , one can derive the scalar bt relations ( [ btgx ] ) .",
    "it is also obvious from ( [ btgt ] ) using the flatness condition @xmath34=0 $ ] that if @xmath24 is a solution of the sg equation , so is @xmath26 .",
    "note also that since the corresponding jost solutions are related by @xmath35 , the exact n - soliton solution may change its number by one , after crossing the defect point , a possibility lost for the frozen bt qdsg .",
    "for deriving the infinite set of conserved quantities , an essential property of an integrable system , for the sg model with a defect we combine the matrix riccati equation technique for the standard sg model ft with the idea of bridging scattering matrices through bt emihab",
    ". therefore let us first describe briefly the technique developed by faddeev - takhtajan for the sg model .",
    "define the monodromy or the transition matrix as a solution to the associated linear equation @xmath36 with the initial data @xmath37 . to expand the transition matrix in asymptotic power series as @xmath38 ,",
    "it is convenient to gauge transform the variable  t t(x , y,)=^-1(x ) t(x , y,)(y ) [ ch ] in equation ( [ l0 ] ) , with @xmath39 and represent it as a product of _ amplitude _ and a _ phase _",
    "t(x , y,)=(1+w(x,))(z(x , y , ) ) ( 1+w(y,))^-1 , where @xmath40 is an off - diagonal and @xmath41 a diagonal matrix , satisfying the condition @xmath42 by a direct substitution of the gauge transformed @xmath43 in the form ( [ wzw0 ] ) into the equation ( [ l0 ] ) one gets z(x , y,)=",
    "_ y^x((x)_3 + ( _ 2-_2e^iu(x)_3 ) w(x,))dx,[z]where @xmath44 and @xmath40 solves a matrix riccati equation @xmath45 this nonlinear equation due to very special form of the coefficients admits asymptotic integration at @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 . putting expansion ( [ asym ] ) in ( [ ric ] ) and comparing the coefficients with different powers of @xmath49 we get the recurrence relation @xmath50 the corresponding expansion for @xmath51 yields from ( [ z ] ) : @xmath52 where matrices @xmath53 are of the form w_n(x)= -|w_n(x ) _",
    "+ + w_n(x ) _ - , z_n(x)=1 2 ( z_n(x ) ( i+ _ 3 ) + -|z_n(x ) ( i- _ 3 ) ) [ wz ] and relations above can be written as the recursion relations starting from @xmath54 @xmath55 with @xmath56 . to derive finally the set of conserved quantities we take the limit of the monodromy matrix @xmath57 where @xmath58 as shown in @xcite the generating function of the conserved quantities : @xmath59  @xmath60",
    ". is obtained by solving the recurrence equation ( [ recurrwz ] ) as @xmath61 and for arbitrary @xmath62 @xmath63 to derive the asymptotic expansion for @xmath64 it suffices to use the involution ft @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , which leaves the lax pair invariant . as a result",
    "we get @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 , giving in particular @xmath71 . therefore one can get the explicit form of the momentum @xmath72 and the hamiltonian @xmath73 of the sg model as p&=&2(c_-1+c_1)= _ -^p(u)dx , p(u)=u_xu_t , + h&=&2(c_-1-c_1)=_-^h(u)dx , h(u)= ( u_x^2+u_t^2 ) + ( 1- u ) .",
    "we now extend the above result of the standard sg model to the sg with a defect ( dsg ) showing that the dsg equation admits an infinite set of conserved quantities indicating the integrability of this system .",
    "in fact , any conserved quantity @xmath74 of the sg model can be transformed into a conserved quantity for the dsg model by adding some extra term @xmath75 , as the contribution from the defect , such that c^d_n=_-^0_n(x , t)dx + d_n+ ^+_0_n(x , t)dx .",
    "our aim is to find an algorithm for evaluating the additional terms @xmath75 , for which we suitably modify the above approach for the sg model @xcite by using ( [ btgt ] ) , a crucial relation in the dsg model . in analogy with the sg",
    "we define the monodromy matrix of the dsg as a solution to the associated linear equation with a defect at the point @xmath5 : @xmath76 with the initial data @xmath37 . at the point @xmath5",
    "we have the jumping condition @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the crucial gluing operator ( [ f0 ] ) at the defect point taking naturally the form @xmath79 similar to the sg case we gauge transform @xmath80 as in ( [ ch ] ) and represent it as in ( [ wzw0 ] ) , where @xmath81 solves a riccati type equation ( [ ric ] ) and @xmath82 is found explicitly in terms of @xmath81 as in ( [ z ] ) .    for finding the conserved quantities @xmath83 , though we use again the same expansion at @xmath84 : @xmath85 the elements of the diagonal matrices @xmath86 have now the contribution from the defect point : @xmath87 .",

    "for such a construction we turn to the general scheme of kunprl , where it was shown that any lax operator satisfying the qybe ( [ lqybe ] ) with @xmath257-matrix ( [ r ] ) can be obtained as a particular realization of the ancestor lax operator l_anc^trig ( ) = (    c c_1^(+ ) e^i s^3 + ^-1c_1^(- ) e^-i s^3  2 s_q^(- ) + 2 s_q^(+ )   e^-i s^3 + ^-1c_2^(-)e^i s^3    ) , with the quantum spin operators generating a generalized quantum algebra = ( m^(+ ) ( 2 s^3 ) -i m^(- ) ( 2 s^3 ) ) 1 , = s_q^ ( ) ,  [ m^ ( ) , ] = 0 . here",

    "note that both the above discrete lax operators obtained as realizations of the quantum integrable @xmath275-operator ( [ al ] ) , by construction must satisfy the qybe exactly with the @xmath276-matrix .",
    "consequently , ( [ qdsgt ] ) with ( [ qt+- ] ) represent a quantum integrable discrete dsg model .",
    "as the quantum lax operator should satisfy the qybe for its quantum integrability , the corresponding classical lax operator consequently should satisfy its classical analog the classical ybe ( cybe)sg \\ { l_j ( ) , l_j ( ) } _ pb=_jk[r ( , ) , l_j ( ) l_k ( ) ] .",
    "note that at the classical limit @xmath277 , the quantum commutator should reduce to the poisson bracket ( pb ) and the operator elements of the quantum lax operator would become just functions , with the form of the lax operators ( [ dsgl ] , [ qdsgf ] ) remaining the same",
    ". only the normal ordering needed in the quantum case should be ignored now . however since the @xmath246-matrix provides the structure constant for the commutation relations , for transition to the classical limit we have to scale the parameter @xmath278 in the @xmath236-matrix ( [ r ] ) as @xmath279 .",
    "this therefore defines the classical limit as @xmath280 in all the elements of the quantum @xmath236-matrix reducing it to the classical @xmath281-matix : @xmath282 as & & r^11_11=r^22_22=a_0 ( ) ,  r^11_22=r^22_11=0 , r^12_21=r^21_12= c_0 ( ) + & & a_0()= ( ) ,  c_0()=1 , while the qybe ( [ lqybe ] ) reduces to the cybe ( [ cybe ] ) .",
    "the underlying algebraic relations are turned into pb relations at this classical limit , which is achieved by taking @xmath280 in ( [ ancalg ] ) , only in the terms that come from the @xmath246-matrix . as a result the classical limit of ( [ ancalg ] ) is given by \\ { s_q^ ( + ) , s_q^(- ) } _ pb = ( m^(+ ) ( 2 s^3 ) -i m^(- ) ( 2 s^3 ) ) 1 ^2 , \\{e^i s^3,s_q^()}_pb = i e^i",

    "alternatively one can check this statement through direct verification .",

    "pb = 2 ^2 ( 2 s^3 ) ^2 , \\{e^i s^3,s_q^()}_pb = i e^i s^3 s_q^ ( ) , which is evidently satisfied by the realization of the generators in the canonical fields @xmath287 as s^3= ,  s_q^ ( ) ( u^ , p^)= 1 e^2i p^(1+^2 u ) ^ using the definition @xmath288 in a similar way we can check the validity of the required pb relations for the elements of @xmath253 ( [ qdsgf ] ) , obtained from ( [ pbanc ] ) at @xmath289 : \\ { s_q^ ( + ) , s_q^(- ) } _ pb = 0 , \\{e^is^3 , s_q^ ( ) } _ pb = i e^is^3s_q^ ( ) . using the classical analog of ( [ rfd ] ) expressed in the same form without normal ordering : @xmath290 and the pb relations like @xmath291 we verify the relations ( [ pbf ] ) , which guarantees that @xmath253 satisfies the cybe ( [ cybe ] ) .",
    "the solution of the local cybe ( [ cybe ] ) leads also to that for the global cybe for @xmath292 : \\ { t ( ) , t ( ) } _ pb=_jk[r ( , ) , t ( ) t ( ) ] , from where in exact analogy with the sg model ft one can extract the action - angle variable corresponding to the continuum as well as the discrete spectrum , proving the complete classical integrability of the dsg model .",
    "this also reveals an intriguing fact that the local differences between the sg and the dsg models seem to become irrelevant at the global level ( [ gcybe ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that at the continuum limit @xmath293 , when the discrete lax operator @xmath294 recovers the bt matrix ( [ f0 ] ) , the dependence of the canonical momentum @xmath295 drops out completely , creating a paradoxical situation that would result a trivial pb for the @xmath296 and naturally not satisfying the cybe ( [ cybe ] ) .",
    "therefore for showing the validity of the cybe for the field model one has to be careful and should take first the pb in the corresponding exact discretized model and then perform the continuum limit .",
    "similar is true also for the lax operators @xmath297 .",
    "our another important result is a discretized bt relation that we can derive connecting the discrete sine - gordon lax operators @xmath251 ( [ dsgl ] ) in the form of a discrete gauge transformation u^+_j(,u^+_j)=f^d_j+1 ( , u^_j+1 , p^_j+1)u^-_j(,u^-_j ) ( f^d_j ( , u^_j , p^_j))^-1 , through the gauge matrix @xmath298 ( [ qdsgf ] ) .",
    "note that we assume this discretized bt to be valid for arbitrary @xmath299 . at the continuum",
    "limit the discrete gauge transformation ( [ dbt ] ) should recover the known gauge relation ( [ btgt ] ) connecting the field lax operators @xmath300 . similarly comparing the elements of the matrix relation ( [ dbt ] )",
    "we can obtain the bridging relation between the discrete variables @xmath301 and @xmath302 of the discretized dsg model at any site @xmath299 , involving also the variables @xmath303 .",
    "this discrete bt relation would yield at the continuum limit @xmath304 , the standard bt relation between the fields @xmath150 ( [ btgx ] ) .      following the formulation of quantum sg model qsg we can apply the algebraic bethe ansatz method to the lattice",
    "regularized quantum dsg constructed above and solve in principle its eigenvalue problem exactly .",
    "recall that the aim of the algebraic bethe ansatz is to solve exactly the eigenvalue problem of @xmath305 , generating all conserved operators including the hamiltonian , in the form : @xmath306 , with the eigenstates @xmath307 defined as @xmath308 .",
    "@xmath309 acts as creation operator , while @xmath310 as destruction operator annihilating the pseudovacuum : @xmath311 a crucial step in this formalism is to construct the pseudovacuum state @xmath312 , which is achieved for the sg model by combining the actions of consecutive pair of lax operators : @xmath313 qsg .",
    "repeating this procedure we can construct the pseudovacuum @xmath314 for the quantum dsg model , yielding @xmath315 , for all sites except the defect point at @xmath316 .",
    "however the single defect point would play a nontrivial role , since after crossing this point , say from the left the pseudovacuum property : t^-()|0>^- = (    c a^-()|0>^-   |1>^- + 0   a^-*()|0>^-    ) , would be lost due to nontriangular matrix form of @xmath317 . instead of annihilating the local vacuum , as needed by the lower left corner operator element of the matrix @xmath317 ,",
    "the defect at site @xmath316 would turn it to a state @xmath318 , creating at the same time its conjugate state @xmath319 at the upper right corner .",
    "this is expected to lead to the creation / annihilation of quantum states by the defect point similar to that with classical solitons as we have observed exploiting the bt in sect .",
    "4 . perhaps one should explore the possibility of using a quantum extension of the bt qbt to mimic the successful classical approach , using the relation like ( [ dbt ] ) at the quantum level .",
    "these tricky points however need careful and separate analysis and should be dealt with elsewhere .",
    "it is crucial to check that the classical and quantum integrable discrete dsg model we constructed and solved above would yield the same dsg field model we have started with , at the continuum limit : @xmath320 .",
    "note that at this limit the canonical variables go to canonical fields : @xmath321 , with @xmath322= i\\delta(x - y ) $ ] .",
    "therefore for extracting the limit we have to scale @xmath323 giving @xmath324 in both the discrete lax operators @xmath325 and @xmath137 .",
    "observing further that _ rotated _ operator @xmath326 is also a solution of qybe due to the symmetry of the @xmath236-matrix : @xmath327=0 , a=1,2,3 $ ] , we expand the lax operator ( [ dsgl ] ) in powers of @xmath328 at all sites @xmath329 ( except at the defect point ) as ^1 u^_j = ( 1 + ^x+ 2 _ x- 2 u^(x ) dx)+o(^2 ) = ( 1 + u^(x))+o(^2 ) , with the field operator @xmath330 recovering exactly the lax operator ( [ uv ] ) of the sg field model .",
    "note that we have put the deforming parameter @xmath331 in all expressions related to the continuum model , for simplicity .",
    "thus we recover at the continuum limit , the dsg field model at all points except at @xmath2 .    performing the same continuum limit at the defect point @xmath332",
    ", we get on the other hand from ( [ qdsgf ] ) : f^d_0(,u^+_0,p^+_0 ; u^-_0,p^-_0 ) f^0_0(,u^+(0 ) , u^-(0 ) ) + i f^ ,  f^=(p^+_0-p^-_0)[_3 , f^0_0(,u^+(0 ) , u^-(0 ) ) ] , clearly giving @xmath296 at @xmath320 , i.e. it recovers the same bt matrix ( [ f0 ] ) at the defect point , meeting the essential requirement . therefore collecting all nontrivial terms we get finally the continuum limit of the lattice regularized model ( [ qdsgt ] ) as t()=(e^ ^+ _ 0 u^+ ( , x )",
    "dx )   f^0_0(,u^+(0 ) , u^-(0 ) )  ( e^ _ - ^0 u^- ( , x ) dx ) yielding the original dsg field model .    finally in the continuum limit using ( [ l ] ) and the expansion like @xmath333 etc .",
    "we can show directly that the discrete bt relation ( [ dbt ] ) goes to the field bt as gauge - transformation between @xmath300 , while the relation between its matrix elements connecting @xmath268 recovers the bridging relation ( [ btgx ] ) .",
    "we stress again that for proving the classical and quantum integrability of the field model ( [ tcsg ] ) one has to go to its proper lattice regularized version ( [ qdsgt ] ) and check the validity of the cybe and qybe before taking back the continuum limit .",
    "we have proved here the classical and quantum integrability of the sine - gordon model with a defect by finding the exact solution of the related quantum as well as classical yang - baxter equation through integrable discretization of the model .",
    "this enables one to solve the quantum eigenvalue problem by algebraic bethe ansatz and the classical model for the action - angle variables .    combining matrix bcklund transformation with the matrix riccati equation approach",
    "we have extended the existing formalism and found all higher conserved quantities for the defect sine - gordon model in a systematic way , with explicit forms of the defect contribution . in the simplest case",
    "this gives the momentum and hamiltonian of the dsg model found earlier .",
    "deviating from the earlier studies we have used the _ unfrozen _",
    "bt , which can produce intriguing effect like creation or annihilation of solitons by the defect point , apart from the preservation of soliton with phase shift as predicted earlier .",
    "we have also found the constraints showing exactly how the creation / annihilation or preservation of solitons depend on the boundary conditions of the field , in the framework of the defect sine - gordon model .",
    "this result should be of crucial importance in the possible experimental detection of such unusual events .",
    "a pertinent question arises here regarding the obvious violation of topological charge in this sg model with a defect due to possible nonconservation of soliton number .",
    "it should be noted however that the topological charge arises in the sg model as a degree of mapping from @xmath334 , while a defect in the coordinate - axis or a discontinuity point ( like a puncture in the sphere ) as occurs in the dsg , can not be mapped into a smooth sphere or @xmath335 , violating thus the concept of the topological charge itself .",
    "therefore in the dsg the solitons seem to be no longer topological and hence their number may change . the formation of nontopological semi - fluxons msgni1 therefore may also be possible to explain in the framework of the dsg model kunfutur .",
    "after completion of our work , very recently an important paper has appeared in the arxiv def07 , where systematic studies were made using the lax pair formalism of integrable systems in the line of the present investigation , and consequently infinite set of conserved quantities were obtained for a whole class of defect models e.g. sg , nls , kdv , mkdv , liouville , dnls etc . , belonging to the akns and the kn spectral problems and having a defect at a single point , which in principle could be extended to multiple defect def07 .",
    "similar to our approach the conserved quantities are found through riccati equation , though in contrast to the matrix riccati equation used here this equation is a scalar one . in the same work",
    "the importance of establishing the complete integrability of the defect models , at the classical and the quantum level , through the yang - baxter equation as well as the necessity of discretization of the model for achieving this goal are emphasized .",
    "interestingly both these agenda in the wish - list were addressed and solved rigorously in the present paper .",
    "extension of the exact result of the quantum and classical dsg model through the yang - baxter equation presented here , to other models like nls , dnls etc . treated in def07",
