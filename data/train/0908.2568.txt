    "in the last few years there has been a great deal of progress in the study of gluon scattering amplitudes in the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions , 4 super yang - mills ( sym ) .",
    "one of the most surprising developments has been the discovery of a hidden symmetry in the planar ( @xmath2 ) limit , coined as `` dual super - conformal symmetry ''  @xcite , different from the original super - conformal symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "this symmetry was uncovered by introducing a new set of variables @xmath3 , related to the external ( all taken as incoming ) gluon momenta @xmath4 , @xmath5 , through x_i - x_i+1=p_i  , [ eq : xi ] and acts on the @xmath3 just as a four - dimensional conformal symmetry acts on spatial coordinates .",
    "the presence of this dual symmetry can be understood through the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite since it was shown  @xcite that the problem of calculating a given scattering amplitude can be mapped , through a fermionic t - duality , to that of calculating a light - like wilson loop with corners at coordinates given by the @xmath3 .",
    "this fermionic t - duality maps the string @xmath6-model to itself , and the dual conformal symmetry becomes the ordinary symmetry of the space in which the wilson loop lives .    like the ordinary conformal symmetry",
    ", the dual symmetry is broken by infrared divergences , arising as cusp divergences in the language of wilson loops .",
    "however , the cusp divergences are known to exponentiate , which allows the use of the broken symmetry to impose powerful constraints on the amplitudes in the form of anomalous ward identities .",
    "these identities fix the 4 and 5 point amplitudes completely while the undetermined parts of higher - point amplitudes can only depend on dual - conformal invariants .",
    "also , taken together , the original and dual conformal symmetries generate an infinite - dimensional yangian symmetry  @xcite , ordinarily characteristic of exactly solvable models .",
    "interesting properties of 4 amplitudes appear also in their high energy ( regge ) limit . in a nutshell",
    ", regge theory establishes the structure of scattering amplitudes when the momentum transfer is small compared to the total center - of - mass energy .",
    "it turns out that 4 amplitudes exhibit regge - like behaviour at all orders in the t hooft coupling even outside of the regge limit .",
    "in fact , the 4 and 5 point amplitudes are regge exact  @xcite , meaning that they can always be written in a factorized form characteristic of high energies , irrespective of the values of the kinematical invariants .",
    "furthermore , in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) of gluon amplitudes the regge limit is independent of the gauge theory , so 4 can give insight into the high energy behaviour of qcd .    in the regge limit",
    "amplitudes are dominated by the @xmath7-channel exchange of reggeized gluons ( a reggeized gluon is a collective state of ordinary gluons projected on a colour octet ) .",
    "the bound state of two reggeized gluons when projected on a colour singlet in the @xmath7-channel is known as the hard ( or perturbative ) pomeron .",
    "the interaction between reggeized gluons is governed by the schrdinger - like bfkl integral equation  @xcite where the invariant mass of @xmath8-channel gluons can be interpreted as the time variable and its kernel as an effective hamiltonian living on the two - dimensional transverse space .",
    "this hamiltonian is free from infrared singularities and carries a yet to be understood integrability  @xcite .",
    "the question that arises is if the integrable structures present in 4 sym can shed some light on the integrability found in the regge limit . in this region the dynamics of the theory is reduced to the transverse plane , where a two - dimensional conformal symmetry was found in the effective hamiltonian  @xcite . given the emergence of the yangian in the four - dimensional case , and that one can heuristically interpret this @xmath9 as a reduction of the four - dimensional ordinary conformal symmetry , it would then seem natural to look for a dual @xmath9 symmetry in the high - energy limit , similar to the change of variables , with the @xmath10 being the gluon transverse coordinates in complex notation  @xcite . ] .",
    "it is this question that we address in this letter , showing that bfkl indeed exhibits covariance under such a dual symmetry .",
    "we will also study a set of corrections to bfkl , in the form of @xmath11 reggeized gluon transition vertices , which also turn out to be dual @xmath9-covariant .",
    "this result is important for high - energy qcd , since the inclusion of such vertices is necessary , at sufficiently high energies , to fulfill unitarity in all channels .",
    "the scattering amplitude for the 2 to 2 reggeized gluons process in the regge limit has an iterative structure dominated by the exchange in the @xmath7-channel of a colour singlet .",
    "this implies that in the lla the corresponding 4 point gluon green function can be written as the solution to an integral equation , the bfkl equation , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfkl ] . written in terms of @xmath12 , the mellin conjugate variable of the center - of - mass energy ( which can be translated into the rapidity , @xmath13 , of the emitted particles in the @xmath8-channel ) ) , and the incoming two dimensional momenta it reads @xmath14 where the kernel @xmath15 is given by @xmath16\\delta ^{(2)}(\\bo{k}_a-\\bo{k } ' ) \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : kernel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the `` real emission '' part limit is taken this piece in the kernel corresponds to the contribution to multiparticle production from on - shell gluons in the @xmath8-channel . ]",
    "has the following structure k_r ( _ 1 , _ 2 ; _ 3 , _ 4 ) = -n_cg^2 .",
    "[ eq : kernelr ] this notation , with @xmath17 being the cyclically ordered reggeized gluon momenta taken as incoming , will be convenient for the generalization of this vertex to the @xmath18 reggeized gluon transition case as we will see below .",
    "the gluon regge trajectory reads ( ^2 ) = -d^2  .",
    "[ eq : trajectoryreggegluon ] the trajectory is ir divergent , requiring it to be regularized in general .    we will now show that the bfkl equation in eq .",
    "exhibits formally a dual @xmath9 symmetry , which , in contrast with the original @xmath9 symmetry of bfkl , uncovered by fourier transforming into a coordinate representation , is realized in the transverse momentum space .",
    "this new symmetry is closely analogous to the dual conformal symmetry observed in @xmath19 sym for gluon scattering amplitudes , and we will see that it turns out to be broken by infrared effects just as in the four dimensional gauge theory .",
    "let us now rewrite eq .   in terms of dual variables .",
    "taken as incoming , the external momenta are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 so , introducing the notation @xmath24 , we define the new set of variables as @xmath25 equivalently , we could have written @xmath26 with @xmath27 then being a simple shift of the origin for the external momenta .    in these new variables",
    "the gluon regge trajectory is ( _ a^2 ) = ( x^2_1,2)=-d^2 x_i  , [ eq : trajectoryreggegluonk1x ] where we have introduced @xmath28 through @xmath29 . ignoring for the moment that this expression is divergent and",
    "thus ill - defined , we see that is has a formal two - dimensional conformal symmetry . it is formally invariant under translations , rotations and scalings of the @xmath3 , and also under the conformal inversions @xmath30 , since they would imply d^2 x_i  , x_i , j^2  .",
    "[ eq : transfxij ] in the same way @xmath31 is also formally conformally invariant . now , given that the trajectory is infrared divergent one would expect this symmetry to be broken by the introduction of a regulator , an issue which is discussed in the next section .",
    "rewriting the full kernel   in terms of the @xmath3 , with @xmath32 , we get k(x_1,2 , x_3,2 ; x_1,i , x_3,i ) = + ^(2)(x_2,i )  , [ eq : kernelx ] where k_r ( x_1,2 , x_2,3 ; x_3,i , x_i,1 ) = -n_cg^2  . [ eq : kernelrx ] using that @xmath33 under conformal inversions one then finds immediately that the kernel transforms covariantly k(x_1,2 , x_3,2 ; x_1,i , x_3,i ) x^2_2x^2_i k(x_1,2 , x_3,2 ; x_1,i , x_3,i )  .",
    "together with translations , rotations and dilatations this forms a dual @xmath9 symmetry , different from the one previously known .",
    "more precisely , dilatations and rotations coincide with the original @xmath9-symmetry , while translations and inversions will be different .    applied to the bfkl equation   and using that the integration measure transforms according to   one finds that a factor of @xmath34 is produced inside the integral . consequently",
    ", if the green function @xmath35 were to produce a factor of @xmath36 upon inversion , then its convolution with the kernel @xmath37 , would transform in the same way as @xmath38 itself .",
    "now , at lowest order , @xmath38 is simply given by the delta function , which indeed transforms in this way , @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath38 can be constructed through iterated convolution with the kernel , it follows that the green function should have the same conformal properties as the delta function .",
    "we can obtain a formal expression for the green function having the correct conformal properties by iteration . introducing the short - hand notation _ 0 ( * k_a , * q ) ( _ a^2 ) + ( ( _ a-)^2 ) , ( * k , * k_a , * q )   one finds ( with @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 * * * * *    rather than @xmath12 it is more natural to use the rapidity difference , @xmath13 , between the external particles as the evolution variable .",
    "to this end we perform the inverse mellin transform @xmath42 the formula @xmath43 for @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , is useful to obtain the final expression , written in dual @xmath46-variables : @xmath47 where @xmath48 this representation preserves the transformation properties of the original equation . in the forward case , where the momentum transfer is zero , the same structure remains with _",
    "i , i-1 = 2((x_1,i)-(x_1,i-1 ) )  , _ i , i-1 = |_s 1 x^2_i-1,i  . in this case",
    "the solution also has a formal dual @xmath9 covariance .",
    "this should be contrasted with the original @xmath9-invariance of the bfkl kernel , which does not appear in the forward case .    before ending this section ,",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that this formal dual @xmath9 covariance is present in the same form for all color projections in the @xmath7-channel since they only differ by a different factor in front of @xmath49 : with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , etc .",
    "in 4 sym infrared divergences break the dual conformal symmetry . for bfkl ,",
    "such divergences cancel , opening the possibility that the dual @xmath9-symmetry remains exact",
    ". however , this turns out not to be the case .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to see this is by studying the forward case . if @xmath38 has the transformation properties of the delta function it can be written as f = f_1 ^(2)(_a - _ b ) + f_2  , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are dual conformally invariant , since @xmath54 is the only other function that transforms correctly . when @xmath55 , @xmath56 and no non - trivial conformal invariant can be formed from the three remaining @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath53 can thus only be a function of @xmath12 ( or equivalently the rapidity @xmath13 ) , and the coupling .",
    "but when forming physical quantities one integrates over @xmath20 and @xmath57 and the divergences at @xmath58 must cancel between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the factor @xmath54 is singular enough to cancel one factor of the trajectory , but @xmath52 is obtained by repeated application of the trajectory part of the kernel so , starting from the second iteration , products of two or more trajectories will appear and the divergences will fail to cancel .    one can also observe the breakdown of the dual @xmath9 symmetry directly by regularizing the integrals and cancelling the divergences explicitly when performing the iteration .",
    "one then finds that the first iteration respects the symmetry , while the second iteration produces a contribution to @xmath53 ( when @xmath55 ) proportional to an anomalous factor of the form @xmath59 , which breaks the symmetry under inversions .",
    "the origin of this factor is the regularization of infrared divergences .",
    "for example , using dimensional regularization with @xmath60 ( x^2_1,2)=-(4 ) ^2d^2 - 2 x_i -(4e^-)^ ( - )  .",
    "the divergences will cancel between the trajectories and the real emission part of the kernel , but factors such as @xmath61 will add up giving a non - vanishing anomalous term .",
    "so , even though bfkl is infra - red finite , a remnant of the divergences remains in the form of the breaking of the dual @xmath9 symmetry in the form given here .",
    "further insight can be gained by studying a standard representation of the green function in the forward case , obtained by diagonalizing the bfkl kernel .",
    "it is ( x_1,2,x_1,4,y ) = _ n=-^ ( x^2_1,2 x^2_1,4)^-  , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in this representation",
    "any dependence on an ir cutoff has canceled explicitly , and one can check that the covariance under conformal inversions is lost .    an important issue is whether the dual @xmath9 symmetry is broken beyond repair or whether it can be deformed to take into consideration the anomalous terms . in a best case scenario",
    "the symmetry would obey to all orders a simple relation such as the anomalous ward identity satisfied by the dual conformal symmetry of @xmath19 scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this issue is studied in @xcite , with the result that the dual @xmath9 does not obey such a simple all - order relation , but can still be deformed so that it becomes exact , at least up to the order studied .",
    "the representation then becomes coupling - dependent , but encouragingly , it seems to do so in such a way that the algebra generated by the original and dual @xmath9 symmetries remains coupling - independent .",
    "the bfkl amplitude will violate bounds imposed by unitarity at sufficiently high energies . in order to restore unitarity ,",
    "one of the new elements that must be introduced is a vertex in which the number of reggeized gluons in the @xmath7-channel is not conserved . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] we choose to write this @xmath11 vertex ( see , for example , eq .",
    "( 3.57 ) of @xcite ) using a convenient assignment of the momentum indices @xmath64 \\label{eq : k2 m } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath65 etc .",
    "are the color indices of the reggeized gluons and @xmath66 the structure constants of @xmath67 .     reggeized gluon vertex .",
    "all momenta are taken as ingoing . ]",
    "written in terms of @xmath46 variables this becomes @xmath68 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is manifestly conformally covariant .",
    "the assignment of the momenta in was chosen so that the vertex takes a form independent of @xmath1 when written in terms of the @xmath3 .",
    "note that the last term vanishes when @xmath69 since then @xmath70 , and one recovers the corresponding term in the bfkl kernel .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the @xmath71 reggeized gluon vertex exhibited the same coordinate representation @xmath9-invariance as the bfkl equation .",
    "this was taken to indicate that a unitary , two - dimensional cft describing scattering amplitudes in the regge limit should exhibit this @xmath9-invariance .",
    "our results would seem to indicate that such a theory should also be covariant under the dual @xmath9 .",
    "we have shown that not only does the lla bfkl kernel , and its extension in the form of the @xmath18 reggeized gluon vertex , exhibit the ordinary @xmath9-symmetry , found by lipatov but also a dual @xmath9 , analogous to the dual conformal symmetry of @xmath19 .",
    "it is tempting to interpret these symmetries as reductions to the transverse plane of the conformal and dual conformal symmetries of the supersymmetric theory , although it is not clear exactly how such a reduction should be carried out .",
    "purely transverse versions of the conformal algebras are not symmetries of the 4-dimensional gauge theory amplitudes , but seem to emerge in the regge limit .    also , the dual invariance of the reggeized gluon vertex suggests that a unitary two - dimensional cft describing high - energy gauge theory should have both @xmath9 groups . in future work , having identified the dual @xmath9 one can try to understand the origin of the integrability of the regge limit in terms of the integrability of @xmath72 sym .",
