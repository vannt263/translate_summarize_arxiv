    "for a system of two interacting particles , the well - known schrdinger equation @xcite can be derived through the formal substitution of the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 by the relevant operators @xcite on both sides of the relation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the classical hamilton function of a system of two interacting particles . here ,",

    "that is , one supposes that the change in the force action of a particle on another one , caused by a measurement of the coordinate of the first , propagates with finite velocity .    thus , to derive the schrdinger nonrelativistic equation for a two - particle system , one uses , on the one hand , the hamilton classical nonrelativistic function and , on the other hand , the implicit assumption about finiteness of the interaction propagation velocity .    in the fully nonrelativistic quantum theory",
    ", we must consider the interaction propagation velocity as infinitely large , which forces us to drop the requirement for the commutation relations  ( [ e2 ] ) to hold .",
    "having accepted this viewpoint , we will consider that , under a measurement of the coordinate of the first particle , there occurs the uncontrolled transfer of momentum not only to this particle but to the whole system since the particles are connected through the interaction potential , whose propagation velocity is infinitely large .",
    "therefore , it is natural to require that the commutator of the coordinate operator of any particle and the of operator total momentum of the system @xmath17 be equal to @xmath18 : @xmath19 = \\left [ \\hat{y}_{k},\\,\\hat{p}_{cy}% \\right ] = \\left [ \\hat{z}_{k},\\,\\hat{p}_{cz}\\right ] = i\\hbar \\,\\text{\\ } ( k=1,2 ) .",

    "the fulfillment of relations  ( [ e1 ] ) is not obligatory for a system of interacting particles , and we intend to reject this requirement .    the first attempt to construct the nonrelativistic equation for a system of interacting particles in the framework of the model with noncommuting operators of coordinates and momenta of different particles",

    "the present work is devoted to the elimination of the drawbacks mentioned above .",
    "the probabilistic interpretation of the square of the modulus of a wave function is possible only under the assumption that measurements of coordinates or momenta of various particles do not principally disturb one another even if there exists some interaction between particles  @xcite .",

    "the wave function @xmath91 can be represented in the following form : @xmath92 where @xmath93",

    "now we consider the laws of conservation which exist for the proposed fully nonrelativistic scheme of the system of two interacting particles .",
    "since no external fields act on the system , its hamiltonian must be invariant relative to a parallel translation of the coordinate system in space and time as well as relative to a rotation of the coordinate axes .",
    "in addition , the motion equations do not change under a uniform and rectilinear motion of the system ( the galilei invariance ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the isolated system ( [ e25 ] ) does not depend on time explicitly , and therefore the energy of the system is an integral of motion .",

    "thus , three components of the total momentum are integrals of motion , and the total momentum of the two - particle system is conserved .    by virtue of the isotropy of space ,",
    "the hamiltonian of a closed system must not vary under a rotation of the whole system by an arbitrary angle around an arbitrary axis .",

    "therefore , this operator is independent of motion of the center of mass of the system since the system of equations ( [ e23])-([e26 ] ) admits the separation of motion of the center of mass of the two - particle system as a whole .    upon the motion of two reference systems relative to one another with constant velocity @xmath123 , the operators @xmath114 and @xmath124 are transformed into @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",

    "the quantity @xmath131 is the average share of the momentum transferred to the second particle under the measurement of the coordinate of the first .",
    "the value of this momentum can be estimated as @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the duration of measurement of the coordinate of the first particle .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath59 can be presented in the form    @xmath134    where @xmath135 or @xmath136 is some constant of the relevant dimensional .",

    "therefore , the parameter of noncommutativity of the operators of coordinates and momenta of different particles can be presented in the form : @xmath139    the proposed method of determination of the parameter of noncommutativity of the operators of coordinates and momenta of different particles contains no parameters and therefore substantially differs from the phenomenological method , proposed in @xcite . in the latter method ,",
    "the representation of the operator @xmath140 includes the parameter @xmath141 , whose determination is ambiguous .",

    "the probabilistic interpretation of wave functions is also conserved .",
    "however , such a choice of the parameter of noncommutativity @xmath145 is not physically correct because there exist different average values of the modulus of the interaction force between particles in different quantum states , and the parameter of noncommutativity should be generally different in each quantum state . in this case",

    "we recall that the motion of an electron in the constant homogeneous magnetic field @xmath147 directed along the @xmath33 axis is described by two equations with regard for the electron spin : @xmath148 \\psi _ { 1}=e_{1}\\psi _ { 1 } , \\label{e55}\\ ] ] @xmath149 \\psi _ { 2}=e_{2}\\psi _ { 2 } , \\label{e56}\\ ] ] where the wave functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 describe the states with the projections of the spin onto the @xmath33 axis @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively . here",

    "<S> a nonrelativistic equation for the system of two interacting particles within the framework of a model with noncommuting operators of coordinates and momenta of different particles is proposed , and a self - consistent system of equations for the wave function of every quantum state is deduced . </S>",
    "<S> solutions for the lowest states of a hydrogenlike atom are found , and the comparison with analogous solutions of the klein - gordon equation for the relativistic spinless problem is performed . in the case where the size of a two - particle system and the compton wavelengths of particles forming it are of the same order , the essential differences with solutions of the schrdinger nonrelativistic equation are revealed . </S>"
