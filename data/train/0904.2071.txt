    "this killing horizon condition leads to specific boundary conditions valid on the event horizon .",
    "while in this manner a well - defined elliptic boundary problem of the einstein - maxwell equations emerges , it is possible to extend its solution beyond the event horizon into the electrovacuum interior of the black hole . entering this region",
    ", one recognizes that now for the two killing vectors @xmath14}\\eta^i \\xi^j > 0\\ ] ] holds , meaning that any non - trivial linear combination of the two killing vectors is space - like . as a consequence ,",
    "the einstein - maxwell vacuum equations are hyberbolic in an inner vicinity of @xmath6 .",
    "taking the boundary values on @xmath6 as ` initial data ' for this hyperbolic system , one can ` evolve ' the vacuum solution regularly further into the black hole s interior .",
    "in this manner one finds , for the kerr - newman black holes , a ` future boundary ' of this hyperbolic region , that is the future boundary of the domain of dependence of the event horizon , i.e.  the inner cauchy horizon @xmath15 .",
    "remarkably , the two horizons of the kerr - newman black holes exhibit an interesting relation , which becomes apparent through the equality @xmath16 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are angular momentum and charge of the black hole and @xmath17 denote the surface areas of the horizons @xmath5 .",

    "thus , this paper provides a detailed description of the work presented in @xcite .    for the derivation of the pure einsteinian results in @xcite",
    "a particular soliton method was used  the so - called bcklund transformation .",
    "it was possible to apply this method because the axisymmetric and stationary einstein vacuum equations can be written in terms of the integrability condition of an associated linear matrix problem .",
    "the bcklund transformation utilizes this structure and creates a new solution from a previously known one . in @xcite",
    "this procedure was the essential ingredient in writing an arbitrary regular axisymmetric , stationary black hole solution in terms of another solution , which describes a spacetime without a black hole , but with a completely regular central vacuum region .",
    "as a consequence of the symmetries of this regular solution , the desired relation between the two horizons was found .",
    "proceeding to the einstein - maxwell fields , we find that the applicability of the bcklund method seems limited . in particular , it is not straightforward to create in this manner the kerr - newman solutions from the flat minkowski space , see @xcite .",
    "consequently , in this paper we treat the combined einstein - maxwell situation in a different way .",
    "a feature common to both the pure einstein and the combined einstein - maxwell cases is the existence , already mentioned , of an associated linear matrix problem whose integrability condition is equivalent to the field equations in vacuum , see @xcite . the bcklund transformation is merely one of several solution techniques ( another one is the so - called ` inverse scattering method ' , see @xcite ) whose applicability results from the existence of this linear problem ( lp ) .",
