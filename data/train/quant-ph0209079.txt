    "exact theories for the dynamics of open quantum systems require solution of the schrdinger equation ( or an equivalent formalism ) for the full system plus environment degrees of freedom .",
    "this is impossible to do analytically except when the environment consists of a set of independent harmonic oscillators ( e.g. , caldeira - leggett model  @xcite , spin - boson model  @xcite ) or spins  @xcite .",
    "neglect of intra - environmental coupling is thus strongly motivated by reasons of mathematical convenience .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to determine whether this approximation is justified physically .",
    "our model consists of a small ( i.e. , highly quantum ) central spin interacting with a bath of self - interacting spins representing the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "we shall sometimes refer to this central spin as the subsystem .",
    "intuition suggests that coupling between environment degrees of freedom can significantly affect the properties of the bath and consequently , through subsystem - environment coupling , the dynamics of the central spin .",
    "mutual interactions of the bath modes allow energy exchange without using the subsystem as an intermediary .",
    "consider an initial state of the subsystem - environment which is perturbed away from equilibrium .",
    "with intra - environmental coupling the rapid initial flow of energy toward a new equilibrium state will largely occur within the environment . without intra - environmental coupling",
    "the energy must flow through the subsystem , leaving it strongly entangled with the bath and hence badly decohered .",
    "[ note that the decoherence effects discussed in this manuscript differ greatly from those which affect macroscopic subsystems  @xcite . ]",
    "intra - environmental interactions may also alter more abstract properties of the bath .",
    "the classical dynamics of a bath of oscillators can change from regular to chaotic when non - linear interactions are added  @xcite . in the quantum case",
    ", such coupling modifies the statistical properties of the energy levels and eigenstates of the bath . specifically , the energy spectra of quantum systems with chaotic classical counterpart exhibit level repulsion , while systems with regular dynamics in the classical limit show a clustering of the energy levels  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the bath eigenstates also changes when the dynamics of the bath undergoes a transition from regular to chaotic .",
    "this effect can be analysed by considering the form of the wigner functions of energy eigenstates : for chaotic systems the wigner functions spread more or less uniformly over the energetically available phase space  @xcite , whereas in the case of regular systems they are more lumpy .",
    "moreover , these spectral signatures of chaos have dynamical consequences  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that dissipation and decoherence will assume different forms for coupled and uncoupled baths .    a qualitative understanding of the effects of bath self - interaction on decoherence , while of obvious theoretical interest",
    ", might also have important applications .",
    "minimization of decoherence is essential for the development and implementation of a number of new technologies such as quantum computing  @xcite , laser control of chemical reactions  @xcite and molecular electronics  @xcite . for quantum computing some proposed physical platforms , such as laser manipulated cold ions in traps in near vacuum  @xcite",
    "can very effectly minimise decoherence .",
    "whether such platforms can be scaled to the @xmath0 ions needed to perform useful computations like factorisation of large integers is unclear  @xcite .",
    "proposed solid state platforms such as single - electron quantum dots embedded in a semiconductor  @xcite are readily scaleable  @xcite , but decoherence is a serious obstacle . in principle",
    "decoherence and dissipation can be reduced through judicious choice of states for implementation of the qubit  @xcite .",
    "( a trivial example would be to avoid states with electric - dipole allowed transitions . )",
    "since the solid state in principle provides enormous freedom over the choice of qubit and matrix , further theoretical insight into the mechanisms of decoherence might prove extremely useful in selecting optimal configurations .",
    "the effect of environmental self - interaction is almost certainly of importance in the solid state .",
    "unfortunately , as we noted above , the analysis of the mechanisms of decoherence and dissipation in self - interacting environments is a problem that defies exact analytical treatments .",
    "standard approaches , like the feynman - vernon influence functional method  @xcite or the nakajima - zwanzig projection technique  @xcite can not be successfully applied unless restrictive hypotheses are made on the nature of the bath and its coupling to the subsystem of interest .",
    "thus , for exact results we must rely on what we can calculate numerically .",
    "environments with few degrees of freedom should in principle provide much of the qualitative information we seek .",
    "such numerical studies also serve a second purpose , namely to provide exact results which can be used as a touchstone to test the reliability of the approximate analytical methods which describe open systems ( e.g. , redfield  @xcite , sra  @xcite master equations and other approaches  @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we study numerically and without approximation the dynamics of a spin-1/2 subsystem coupled to a bath of @xmath1 _ interacting _ spin-1/2 modes . while spin  spin - bath models have been previously studied  @xcite intra - environmental coupling has been neglected .",
    "many different physical systems can be represented with such a model .",
    "examples include a spin chain , a set of magnetic impurities in a solid  @xcite or an array of magnetic moments in a molecular crystal .",
    "alternatively , the system can be interpreted as a model of an atomic impurity in a crystalline solid at low temperature .",
    "the impurity is vibronically coupled to a bath consisting of the phonon modes of the solid  @xcite . at low temperatures , the probability that the impurity is in an electronic state other than the ground state is negligible .",
    "however , the impurity can be prepared in a chosen ( non - radiative ) excited state and so is effectively a two - level system . by the same token , in the low - temperature limit the phonon modes reduce to oscillators with only two accessible levels and can therefore be described as spin-1/2 modes ( i.e. , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . ) .",
    "jahn - teller interactions couple the central spin to the bath .",
    "phonon - phonon interactions inter - couple the bath spins . in our study we consider both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we show that environmental self - interaction has an extremely important effect on decoherence .",
    "strong intra - environmental interactions effectively decouple the subsystem from the environment , and even weak interactions qualitatively change the manner in which phase information is lost .",
    "we see no reason to suppose the effect is peculiar to the spin  spin - bath model , and it should prove of importance in areas of physics where preservation of quantum interference is paramount .",

    "we assume that the frequencies of the bath spins are positive random variables with the debye probability density @xmath12 appropriate for the low energy acoustic modes of a crystal .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the bath has an ohmic spectral density with a sharp cut - off at @xmath13 which is not necessarily the debye frequency itself . at the temperatures we consider , modes with large frequency are unlikely to be populated and so it makes sense to choose a smaller @xmath14 to reflect this fact . for the frequency of the central spin",

    "note that the results obtained in this manuscript do not depend crucially on the specific form  ( [ debye ] ) of the frequency distribution .",
    "in fact , we repeated our calculations with the box distribution @xmath16 and found the qualitative behaviour of the model unaltered by the change .    to simplify the form of mathematical expressions , we set @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and we varied the relative strength of the intra - environmental interactions by letting the parameter @xmath11 range in the interval from @xmath19 ( bath without internal spin - spin coupling ) to @xmath20 ( strong bath self - interaction ) .",

    "in fact , for @xmath37 all terms of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) have the effect of flipping either zero or two spins at once , thereby leaving invariant the subspaces spanned by the ` even ' and ` odd ' basis states .",

    "we therefore conclude that the only effect that a low temperature bath with internal ferromagnetic interactions has on the central spin is a renormalisation  ( [ renbeta ] ) of the @xmath10 parameter in the hamiltonian  ( [ hamzero ] ) ( i.e. , a lamb shift ) . in both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic cases , therefore ,",
    "when intra - environmental interactions are strong the dynamics of the central spin is almost autonomous from that of the bath and is dictated by a hamiltonian of the form  ( [ hamzero ] ) .",
    "as a last remark on the ferromagnetic case , we observe that the dynamics of the central spin is unaffected by whether the bath is composed of an even or odd number of spins .",
    "in this work we considered a spin 1/2 subsystem coupled to a low - temperature bath of interacting spin-1/2 modes .",
    "we focussed attention on the effects of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic intra - environmental interactions on decoherence . in both cases",
    "strong intra - environmental interactions suppress decoherence by making the dynamics of the central spin almost autonomous from the bath itself . more precisely , strong antiferromagnetic couplings among bath spins make the average value of the subsystem - environment interaction hamiltonian vanish , thereby making the central spin evolve with its unperturbed and uncoupled hamiltonian .",
    "strong ferromagnetic couplings among bath spins , on the other hand , cause a lamb shift of the subsystem hamiltonian but otherwise leave it to evolve in isolation .    these effects can be schematically explained by considering  ( [ ham ] ) with @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are subsystem and bath operators .",
    "now , the eigenstates of @xmath150 are also eigenstates of @xmath149 for strong intra - environmental coupling in our model . hence the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath149 in this eigenbasis are zero and so  ( [ ham ] ) can not couple bath eigenstates .",
    "since the initial states of the full system are proportional to bath eigenstates for initial conditions  ( [ initcon ] ) it follows that the time evolved reduced density must be of the form @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the eigenvalue of @xmath149 corresponding to eigenstate @xmath153 of @xmath150 . in the antiferromagnetic case we found that all relevant @xmath152 were zero for strong intra - environmental coupling and hence the dynamics was free of decoherence . for the ferromagnetic case we found that only the lowest energy state was populated at low temperature and so only one term contributes to  ( [ reff ] ) and again the dynamics is coherent , but with a lamb shift .",
    "we expect similar effects to occur in more general baths of coupled anharmonic oscillators .",
    "the key issue as we have seen is what happens to the matrix elements of the spin - bath coupling hamiltonian , in the eigenbasis of the bath , when bath self - interactions are turned on . to suppress decoherence",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements must be small .",
    "clearly in an integrable bath ( i.e. , no self - interaction ) some off - diagonal matrix elements will be large due to selection rules .",
    "one would thus expect strong decoherence for integrable environments . in the case of chaotic environments",
    "it is known that the off - diagonal matrix elements are of order @xmath154 smaller than the diagonal matrix elements  @xcite , where @xmath1 is the number of environmental modes .",
    "since planck s constant is small and @xmath1 is very large , the off - diagonal matrix elements for a chaotic environment are negligible .",
    "hence , we expect at most a lamb shift of the subsystem for each eigenstate of the bath and hence a reduced density like  ( [ reff ] ) .",
    "if in addition the diagonal matrix elements ( i.e. @xmath155 ) vary slowly with energy then at low temperatures we should obtain a reduced density @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a representative low energy diagonal matrix element of the coupling operator .",
    "dynamics should therefore be coherent but ( possibly ) lamb - shifted for systems interacting with low temperature chaotic environments .",
    "finally , returning to the specific case of an atomic impurity in a crystal at low temperature , consider the limit of strong phonon - phonon coupling .",
    "since the wigner functions of the bath eigenstates are nearly uniform over the energetically available phase space  @xcite , energy is distributed over an enormous number of phonon modes . at low temperature , displacements from equilibrium of any phonon mode",
    "must therefore be small .",
    "since coupling of an impurity to a phonon is through its displacement coordinate  @xcite , this coupling will also be small .",
    "thus , we expect diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of the jahn - teller interaction to be small and decoherence to be minimal",
    ". impurity - crystal configurations which might have these attributes include noble gas substitutional or interstitial impurities in diamond ( which has strong phonon - phonon interactions  @xcite ) .",
