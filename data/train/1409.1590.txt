    "simulations of cosmological structure formation show clusters and filaments of dark matter growing from a set of random initial perturbations into a cosmic web ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this cosmic web of dark matter is easiest to investigate by studying its most massive systems , which are clusters of galaxies . about 85% of a cluster s mass is composed of dark matter , while nearly all of the rest is intergalactic hot gas , with a trace amount contributed by stars @xcite .",
    "the hot gas is confined by the cluster s gravitational potential and radiates x - rays , providing powerful diagnostics for properties of the host cluster , including its mass , baryonic content , and dynamic status .",
    "accurate measurements of galaxy cluster masses are useful for more than just describing individual systems ; galaxy cluster masses are needed to verify models of large - scale structure formation @xcite and to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "one way to accurately measure the projected mass of a cluster is through measurements of gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "however , performing such measurements is prohibitively expensive for large samples of clusters and difficult for low redshift clusters . to this end",
    ", scaling relations have been empirically calibrated to connect observed properties to masses .",
    "examples of this include @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 relations .    early work by @xcite showed that these relations can be cast analytically for the case where cold gas falls into preexisting dark matter structures .",
    "those early relations predicted clusters that were overluminous for a given temperature compared to observations .",
    "so @xcite and @xcite showed that preheating could increase the entropy of intergalactic gas .",
    "such a `` preheating '' model elevates the entropy of the gas , preventing the gas from getting too dense . these predicted @xmath15 and @xmath18 relations were roughly consistent with observations .",
    "this expectation that clusters would follow such laws over a large range of m@xmath19 , with standard evolutionary factors , is known as self - similarity @xcite .",
    "the scale - free nature of this behavior arises because the gravitational potential dominates over other energy sources , and gravity is scale - free .",
    "previous work has shown possible deviations from self - similarity at masses approaching those of galaxy groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , possibly due to the increasing fractional contribution of local feedback processes to the cluster energy budget compared to the gravitational potential .",
    "the exact magnitude and behavior of this deviation is not yet defined , but it has been qualitatively reproduced in numerical work @xcite .",
    "a full understanding of the deviation from self - similarity can only come through a thorough exploration of the cluster parameter space  across cluster mass ranges and redshifts .",
    "one under - sampled regime is at moderate redshift and low mass .",
    "clusters with these properties offer us the ability to answer the questions of how scaling relations change from high redshift to low redshift and whether there is any evolution in the low - mass behavior of these relations .",
    "recent work by @xcite provided weak lensing mass measurements from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) of 25 galaxy clusters occupying this redshift regime .",
    "that work lacked high - quality x - ray observations for most of the objects , however .",
    "we use observations with the _ xmm - newton _ satellite to study the x - ray characteristics of this sample and to constrain x - ray property and mass scaling relations for this redshift and mass regime .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sect : data&analysis ] , we describe the properties of our sample , while our analysis techniques are described in section [ sect : analysis ] .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in section [ sect : results ] . in particular , we discuss our fits of three scaling relations involving x - ray luminosity , temperature , and weak lensing mass . finally , we compare our results to other published works in section [ sect : discussion ] and appendix [ apx : xmm_comp ] . throughout this paper , we assume a flat @xmath20cdm cosmology with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",

    "our most obvious source of possible discrepancy with previous works is our choice of apertures , which have a radius @xmath6 motivated by weak - lensing estimates from @xcite that were unavailable to most of the other studies .",
    "another potential source of x - ray temperature discrepancy is the choice of binning spectral data .",
    "some previous works binned spectral data to as few as 12 counts per spectral bin .",
    "we leave our spectra unbinned and fit with the c - statistic .",
    "as this work is focusing on faint clusters , we are limited by low photon counts .",

    "alternatively , data can be binned , but doing so potentially degrades spectral resolution . along with producing better fits for low counts @xcite , use of the c - statistic",
    "can also avoid biases in the high - count regime @xcite .",
    "use of different thermal models for fitting spectra did not cause major deviations in our results .",
    "as we were able to reproduce the earlier results while still using an apec model , this should not therefore bias our results significantly ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we demonstrated in detail ( see appendix [ apx : xmm_comp ] ) that we can recover results of previous works , which verifies their results and ours .",
    "however we caution that the choice of aperture and center affect the estimate of l , t , and m for any cluster , and that results from different analyses can not be blindly combined .",
    "we have measured scaling relations between weak lensing mass , x - ray luminosity , and temperature for a sample of clusters with mass and luminosity around the cluster / group boundary and at redshifts @xmath2 . as we used weak lensing masses and bolometric luminosities and because we only investigated x - ray properties within @xmath6 ,",
    "no exact comparisons are available for our results .",
    "however , we can compare our results to other similar studies , both those focused on local groups and those that include clusters at redshifts similar to what was studied here but more massive than our sample .",
    "our best fit of the m - l relation within @xmath6 was , when neglecting intrinsic scatter , @xmath320 .",
    "@xcite fit this relation using almost the same clusters studied here , with _",
    "luminosities taken from the _ rosat _ measurements , and a higher mass sample , reporting @xmath335 . other works @xcite find values in the range @xmath336 , consistent with but somewhat steeper than ours .    for the l - t relation within @xmath6 , we found a best fit of @xmath337 , although the 160sd groups and the cccp clusters each had shallower slopes when fit independently .",
    "previous results @xcite have reported slopes from @xmath338 .",
    "our results , particularly for the two sub - samples fit individually , are consistent with this range , albeit on the high end .    in this work , we reported the best fit slope of the m - t relation within @xmath6 was @xmath326 .",
    "previous works @xcite have reported slopes in the range @xmath339 . as was the case with the t - l relation ,",
    "our slope for the combined sample is slightly higher than this range , but the group and cluster samples , when fit independently , are both in agreement with these studies .",
    "while comparing our scaling relationships to others is worthwhile , we caution that there are a handful of issues that make direct comparison problematic . as mentioned earlier in this discussion , other works used different radii within which to measure cluster properties .",
    "our choice of @xmath6 was motivated by the requirements imposed from our weak lensing masses , but it means we are analyzing x - ray properties in different apertures from other studies .    another issue that arises when comparing to other studies is the definition of luminosity . in this work , we used bolometric luminosities . however , in the three works that looked at groups that we discuss in this section @xcite , all fit scaling relations with a luminosity only within the energy band of 0.1 - 2.4 kev .",
    "the importance of energy bands was shown by @xcite , who found that when switching from luminosities within 0.1 - 2.4 kev to bolometric luminosites the measured slope of the l - t relation steepened from @xmath340 to @xmath341 .",
    "such a large change in the fit means that we should be careful comparing scaling relations for luminosities derived from different energy bands . as a test of this effect ,",
    "we fit the m - l and t - l relations using luminosities measured in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy band for the 160sd clusters .",
    "the power law indices increased when using the energy limited luminosities from @xmath265 to @xmath342 and from @xmath286 to @xmath343 for m - l and t - l , respectively .",
    "the 160sd sample here has too small a dynamical range to be seriously considered for a scaling relation , but the effect of choosing to fit bolometric luminosities over band - limited luminosities is clear .",
    "also , while our sample is a subset of a randomly selected survey , it is originally based on x - ray selected clusters .",
    "@xcite suggest that x - ray selection preferentially picks centrally concentrated systems ; these systems populate the high @xmath344 side of the t - l relation .",
    "similarly , since our data were drawn from the faint end of a flux - limited sample , we would expect preferentially over - luminous clusters for their mass to be selected .",
    "one of the issues with comparing the difference between the groups examined in this paper and those at low redshift is the ubiquity of masses derived from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "hydrostatic masses may somewhat underestimate the mass of galaxy clusters when compared to weak lensing measurements @xcite .",
    "however , in order to allow a comparison with work on low redshift groups and poor clusters using hydrostatic masses , we make the assumption that both mass estimates are identical .",
    "looking at figure [ fig : mx_tx ] , we can see that our moderate redshift clusters ( @xmath345 ) are almost all hotter and/or less massive than what would be predicted by the lower redshift scaling relations for groups presented in @xcite ( @xmath346 ) , although five low - temperature clusters agree very well .",
    "if we test the hypothesis whether our data are fit by the sun2009 relationship between mass and temperature , we find a @xmath334 value of 19.09 for 14 clusters ( @xmath347 ) .",
    "therefore , to within @xmath348 we see no difference between our sample and the low - redshift sample .",
    "if we limit this analysis to only those clusters with temperature kt < 4 kev , our value of @xmath334 is 3.15 for 9 clusters ( @xmath349 ) .",
    "if we do not scale the mass by e(z ) , @xmath334 becomes 29.53 for 14 clusters ( @xmath350 ) .",
    "this significance is just below 3@xmath231 , constituting very weak evidence for the expected self - similar evolution in the temperature - mass relation for groups .",
    "a direct comparison between the cccp sample and our sample , which affords a comparison between low - mass and high - mass clusters at a similar redshift range , is difficult due to the limited number of clusters in both sets .",
    "so to provide some quantification of whether the two populations differ , we utilize fisher s exact test , which looks at how two properties are distributed in two populations . in this case , we look at how our sample and the cccp sample compare to the scaling relations .",
    "we choose to use fisher s exact test due to how few objects we have ; in this domain , fisher s exact test is the best , if not the only , test to use @xcite .    for both samples ,",
    "we count how many clusters lie above the lines of best fit for each scaling relation and how many lie below .",
    "our null hypothesis is that the samples are similar and so the number of clusters above the relation should equal the number below , statistically .",
    "we compute p - values for the t - l , m - l , and m - t relations of @xmath351 , @xmath352 , and @xmath352 , respectively .",
    "we therefore can not reject the hypothesis that groups and clusters at intermediate redshift behave identically with respect to the scaling relations derived in this work , so our measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that z@xmath3530.3 - 0.5 x - ray selected clusters and groups / poor clusters follow similar x - ray scaling laws .",
    "we have presented new and revised x - ray properties for a sample of 15 galaxy clusters originally drawn from a random sample of the 160 square degree survey . covering a range of redshifts from @xmath2 and limited in mass to @xmath354 , our new x - ray data together with previously published hst weak lensing measurements probe a largely - unexplored parameter space in cluster mass and redshift . by using a rigorous analysis to match cluster properties measured within the same radius as existing weak - lensing masses",

    "use of detections near the flux threshold of objects subject to blending because of the angular resolution , such as _ rosat _ cluster surveys , can therefore lead to errors in both position and flux that can be larger than the quoted statistical flux uncertainty .",
    "\\2 . inside @xmath6 , for the mass and redshift range studied here , the fourteen clusters with reasonable mass measurements and 50 clusters from the cccp are best fit by the relation @xmath355 when we allow for intrinsic scatter , the exponent of the best fit becomes @xmath356 .",
    "our results indicate neither a break in the scaling relation among groups nor increased scatter at low mass .",

    "our reported bolometric luminosity is similar to theirs ( @xmath378 and @xmath379 @xmath380 @xmath381 erg @xmath96 , respectively ) , but their reported temperature is noticeably lower than our own ( @xmath382 kev compared to @xmath111 kev ) .",
    "the difference in the result may arise from their less stringent cut for selecting good time intervals , their grouping of their data into energy bins , their use of a smaller aperture , and their lack of pn observations , which supply around 50% of the counts but were often problematic to calibrate 5 years ago .",
    "if we also make these choices , we measure a new temperature of @xmath383 kev , which agrees with the earlier result .",
    "however , when we reduce our aperture size and bin the spectral data , we find an even lower luminosity ; our new bolometric luminosity is @xmath384 @xmath381 erg @xmath96 .",
    "after private communication with s. bruch , we discovered that the same spectral fitting results were obtained but not published for an aperture of 0.5 mpc . using the 4.647 kpc @xmath385 scale provided in the refereed paper , we extract spectra from a 107.60@xmath93 aperture . when letting the abundance vary , we find @xmath386 kev and @xmath387 @xmath381 erg @xmath96 .",
