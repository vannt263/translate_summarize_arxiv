    "the electronic band structure in single - layer graphene is well - known for its linear dirac cones around k points in the brillouin zone .",

    "the twisting pattern can be observed by the scanning tunneling microscopy@xcite , high - resolution transmission electron microscopy@xcite , and atomic force microscopy.@xcite besides electronic properties , it has been widely shown that single - layer graphene and blg have peculiar mechanical and lattice properties.@xcite there is increasing interest in studying possible effects from the twisting pattern on the lattice properties of the blg.@xcite the most recent experiment demonstrates that the raman spectrum strongly depends on the twisting angle of the moir pattern in blg.@xcite    in above studies of various properties of the twisting blg , a fundamental issue is to prepare the twisting angle of the blg sample .",

    "now , a fundamental question arises : is there any preference for the twisting angle in the blg sample ? should the experiment always observes a commensurable angle in the twisting blg ?",
    "the present work studies the interlayer interaction in the twisting blg to shed some light on these questions from the energy point of view .    it has been a great challenge for theoretician to calculate the interlayer interaction in layered structures like blg . to calculate the atomic energy",

    "is usually described by a lennard - jones potential . however , on the one hand , the interlayer interaction is long - range , so the standard dft approach can not describe it , because the dft is based on a local density approximation or a generalized gradient density approximation.@xcite on the other hand , it has been pointed out that the vdw potential itself is not sufficient to describe the interlayer energy , especially for the interlayer shearing movement , because the shearing is dominant by the @xmath3-overlap between different layers@xcite and the registry matching plays an important role.@xcite the shearing property calculated from a pure vdw potential is one order smaller than the experimental value in such layered structure.@xcite    there are mainly two solutions for this issue . the first method is to develop a vdw - corrected dft ( dft - d ) approach , where the long - range interaction is described directly by the vdw potential@xcite or is included through a density - density interaction in the dft scheme@xcite .",
    "the second method is to include the @xmath3-overlap through some empirical potential terms with empirical parameters fitted to experiment or dft - d results.@xcite as pointed out by girifalco and hodak in 2002 , these two methods are actually related to each other and should give the same results for interlayer interaction if they are applied properly.@xcite in present study , the registry - dependent empirical interlayer potential will be applied in the calculation of the interlayer interaction , as long as we aim at simulations for large systems .",
