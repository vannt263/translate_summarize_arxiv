    "a theorem by vafa and witten  @xcite states that qcd can not spontaneously break parity .",
    "however the validity of this result has been questioned by several authors . at finite temperature",
    "there are parity  odd lorentz non  invariant operators that may have non vanishing expectation values in the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "it is also not clear whether the conclusion of the theorem can be extended to purely fermionic operators  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the proof followed by the authors of  @xcite might implicitly assume the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of parity  @xcite .",
    "recently aguado and asorey  @xcite have proved that parity can not be broken by the topological charge operator @xmath1 .",
    "the vacuum energy density @xmath2 is a well defined smooth function for any value of @xmath3 .",
    "this excludes the possibility of a cusp at @xmath4 and implies @xmath5 and a volume  independent finite value for the topological susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "a direct check of this issue on the lattice can be useful .",
    "the idea is to study the volume ( in)dependence of the topological susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "one can parametrize the breaking of parity by writing for the topological charge @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a parameter , @xmath9 the space ",
    "time volume ( @xmath10 is the lattice size ) . the quantity @xmath11 is the expectation value of @xmath1 in each of the two ( possible ) broken parity vacua among which , at finite volume , the system can do tunneling ( @xmath12 means no parity violation ) .",
    "@xmath13 is a fluctuation whose distribution satisfies @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "assuming that @xmath13 is stochastically independent of the broken parity vacuum , the topological susceptibility reads @xmath16 lattice simulations can give an upper bound to @xmath17 and hence to the possibility of a spontaneous breaking of parity .",
    "pure yang ",
    "mills @xmath0 theory was numerically simulated by using the standard plaquette action on the lattice at @xmath18 on three different volumes : @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in all cases a heat  bath algorithm was used for updating configurations and care was taken to decorrelate successive measurements in order to render them independent . on the lattice we determined the topological charge with the 1smeared operator @xmath22 introduced in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . the relationship between the lattice bare topological susceptibility @xmath23 and the physical one @xmath6 is given by  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lattice spacing , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are renormalization constants that can be extracted by using a nonperturbative method  @xcite . in eq.(3 ) @xmath6 is the physical topological susceptibility that coincides with @xmath28 . as it is argued in  @xcite , if parity is broken a volume dependence of @xmath6 is expected .    in order to provide a clear upper bound to the parity breaking parameter @xmath17 ,",
    "we have performed high statistics runs for all lattice sizes by using the apemille computers in pisa .",
    "the results are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the trend in this figure is consistent with a volume  independence of @xmath29 for large enough sizes .",
    "however , any definite conclusion must be drawn from the physical topological susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "if the same values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are used for all volumes , it is clear from eq.(3 ) that fig.1 will be transformed into an analogous figure that displays the same trend for the physical topological susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "however in perturbation theory the renormalization constants present a mild dependence on the lattice size @xmath10 , at least for small @xmath10 .",
    "this is a well  known result for several 2dimensional models  @xcite .",
    "although no similar analysis have been carried through for 4dimensional qcd , it is expected that in this theory the inclusion of the zero  modes will show up again as an explicit dependence on @xmath10 .    in principle",
    "an @xmath10 dependence is expected also for the exact nonperturbative determination of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we are currently calculating @xmath26 and @xmath27 following the method of  @xcite .",
    "high statistics is required to reduce the errors .",
    "we are using lattice sizes @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath19 .",
    "the results will be extrapolated by using the functional forms @xmath32    9 c. vafa , e. witten , phys .",
