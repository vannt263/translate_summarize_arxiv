    "a supernova explosion accelerates a significant fraction of the material of the progenitor star up to a few percent of the light speed c. the initial density of the blast shell plasma is many orders of magnitude larger than that of the surrounding plasma of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; the blast shell expands freely .",
    "the reduction of the plasma density at the front of the radially expanding blast shell and its piling up of the ism plasma imply that the latter eventually starts to affect the expansion . a forward shock between the upstream ism plasma and the downstream plasma and a reverse shock between the downstream plasma and the ( upstream ) blast shell plasma form close to the blast shell front .",
    "the downstream region between both shocks expands in time .",
    "the shock formation initiates the sedov - taylor phase of the supernova remnant ( snr ) blast shell s expansion @xcite , in which it can propagate over astronomical distances before it is stopped by its interaction with the ism .",
    "the low particle collision frequency in the ism implies that the forward shock is collision - less .",
    "its dynamics is dominated by collective plasma processes , which imposes constraints on the range of parameters for which stable shocks can form .",
    "the temperature of the cool ionized component of the ism is about 1 ev and the sound speed @xmath0 m / s .",
    "the sound speed is defined by @xmath1 for electrons and ions with temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( ion mass @xmath4 and boltzmann constant @xmath5 ) , assuming that the adiabatic constant @xmath6 is equal for both species . a fast snr shock , like the north - eastern ( ne )",
    "shock of the snr rcw86 @xcite , would have a mach number @xmath7 in the ism plasma .",
    "the weak magnetization of the ism @xcite suggests that snr shocks are essentially unmagnetized .",
    "electrostatic unmagnetized plasma shocks can be generated in laboratory plasmas @xcite and in simulation plasmas @xcite by the collision of two plasma clouds at an appropriate speed .",
    "collisions between identical plasma clouds can result in two types of unmagnetized electrostatic shocks @xcite .",
    "sub - critical shocks can convert the entire kinetic energy of the inflowing upstream plasma into heat .",
    "the shock - reflected ion beam of super - critical shocks provides an additional energy dissipation mechanism and such shocks are stable at larger mach numbers than the sub - critical shocks .",
    "analytic estimates of the maximum mach number exist , at which we find stable electrostatic shocks .",
    "the largest estimates of the maximum mach number of shocks , which develop out of the collision of two identical plasma clouds , are derived under the assumption that the electron temperature @xmath8 exceeds by far the ion temperature @xmath9 and that the particle velocity distributions are maxwellian s far upstream of the shock @xcite .",
    "the peak mach number of subcritical shocks is in this case @xmath10 , while that of super - critical shocks is @xmath11 .",
    "the peak mach number of shocks decreases with a decreasing ratio @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "no stable electrostatic shocks exist under these approximations above a value @xmath13 , which is orders of magnitude below those of snr shocks .",
    "an asymmetry between the colliding plasma clouds in terms of the electron temperature and density yields a double layer @xcite that can raise the maximum value of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "double layers are unstable , because the thermal pressure of the dense hot downstream plasma is not necessarily balanced by the deceleration or reflection of the upstream plasma .",
    "experimental observations indicate that most double layers are rarefactive and some are compressive @xcite in their rest frame",
    ". they may thus not result in stable shocks , but they can trigger the formation of stable electrostatic shocks @xcite , even if the initial mach number of the flow speed is 100 @xcite .",
    "shocks can be stabilized for @xmath15 by a magnetic field .",
    "an example is the earth s quasi - perpendicular bow shock @xcite .",
    "it has a mach number @xmath16 10 - 12 with respect to the ion acoustic speed , if we take an electron temperature of 10 ev of the solar wind and a shock speed of 500 km / s in the rest frame of the solar wind .",
    "this mach number exceeds the stability limit of electrostatic shocks and the magnetic field must thus provide an additional stabilization . indeed the earth bow shock is a fast mhd mode shock @xcite .",
    "shocks that propagate into an upstream medium with a uniform magnetic field have been examined in the context of snr shocks with particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite .",
    "these studies have addressed their stability , their efficiency in accelerating electrons and they have examined wave instabilities in the foreshock @xcite . usually a relatively strong magnetic field is used due to computational constraints .",
    "it is important to determine if a magnetic field is essential for a shock formation and for its stable propagation , given that the magnetic field of the ism is relatively weak .",
    "unmagnetized electrostatic shocks with a mach number @xmath17 may not exist in the ism .",
    "this mach number is however a least upper bound .",
    "it is based on the electron temperature of the ism and neglects any pre - heating of the ism by the shock . unless the shock is quasi - perpendicular",
    ", shock - accelerated electrons or hot downstream electrons can escape upstream of the shock .",
    "they increase the ion acoustic speed , which in turn decreases the mach number .",
    "an electron foreshock is observed , for example , at the earth s bow shock @xcite .",
    "hot electrons are detected ahead of this shock even though the temperature difference between the electrons in the ( downstream ) magnetosheath and the upstream solar wind is well below that between the downstream region of snr shocks and the ism .",
    "hotter electrons ahead of an snr shock result in a higher @xmath18 and therefore in a lower value of @xmath14 .",
    "this pre - heating mechanism is independent of the heating of the foreshock by the cosmic ray precursor @xcite and the wave precursors @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of electrostatic unmagnetized snr shocks motivates our numerical study .",
    "the shock is generated by letting an unmagnetized plasma collide head - on with a reflecting wall at the speed @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to a collision of two equal plasma clouds at 2@xmath19 , because the particles are reflected elastically .",
    "we perform 7 separate simulations in which the collision speed between the plasma and the wall is varied from 1.06@xmath18 to 2.48@xmath18 .",
    "the temperatures of the co - moving and spatially uniform electrons and ions are equal .",
    "the downstream plasma and its boundary , the shock , expand away from the wall and into the upstream region .",
    "the shock speed is thus always larger than the collision speed .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "all shocks are super - critical and move at a speed higher than 1.6 @xmath18 in the upstream reference frame .",
    "the simulations thus demonstrate that stable shocks can form even if the ions are as hot as the electrons , which is not possible according to some analytic models @xcite . a higher speed of the inflowing plasma results in a sharper shock discontinuity and in a larger density of the shock - reflected ion beam @xcite .",
    "the fraction of ions that can cross the shock decreases and the expansion of the downstream plasma is slowed down ; doubling @xmath19 from 1.06 @xmath18 to 2.12 @xmath18 can only raise the shock s mach number from 1.69 to 2.31 .",
    "shocks form instantly only for @xmath20 1.9 @xmath18 .",
    "an increase of @xmath19 beyond this value delays the shock formation by tens of inverse ion plasma frequencies . a collision at @xmath21 results in a shock with @xmath22 and no shock forms for @xmath23 during the resolved timescale , which is comparable to that achieved in laboratory experiments .",
    "it may thus not always be possible to observe fast electrostatic shocks in laser - plasma experiments , while they can develop in the essentially unbounded astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the density of the shock - reflected ion beam , which increases with the collision speed , raises the overall ion number density ahead of the shock .",
    "this foreshock region goes on a positive potential relative to the upstream plasma , which is maintained by the ambipolar electrostatic field of the plasma density gradient .",
    "upstream electrons are accelerated towards the shock by this electric field .",
    "the accelerated electrons interact with the electrons , which leak from the downstream region into the foreshock .",
    "their mixing raises the mean thermal energy of the electrons in the foreshock to about 1/3 of the downstream one for all considered cases and the electron velocity distribution becomes a flat - top one rather than a maxwellian one .",
    "the simulations suggest that this electron temperature depends on the relative speed between the pre - accelerated upstream electrons and the leaking downstream electrons and not on the electron temperature far upstream of the shock .",
    "the implication is that once an electrostatic shock is present it is no longer appropriate to determine its stability properties using the mach number it would have in the far upstream , because it propagates through a much hotter foreshock plasma .",
    "we outline the particle - in - cell simulation scheme and our initial conditions in section 2 , we present our results in section 3 and we discuss them in section 4 .",
    "the mechanism how a shock forms can be understood with the qualitative model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a plasma cloud is reflected at the position @xmath24=0 .",
    "the cloud is spatially uniform and unmagnetized .",

    "we assume in this qualitative model that the ions are cold , so that the ion front does not spread out in time . the reflected ions and",

    "it expands at the speed @xmath19 to larger values of @xmath24 .",
    "we call this sheet the overlap layer .",
    "the higher electron mobility implies that some electrons stream out of this layer .",
    "they form a thin negatively charged sheet just outside of it .",
    "an ambipolar electrostatic field is built up and the overlap layer goes onto a positive potential with respect to the inflowing upstream plasma .",
    "the electric field decelerates the ions that enter the overlap layer and this plasma compression raises the density of this layer above the value @xmath26 .",
    "this field also confines the electrons and accelerates the surface ions of the overlap layer @xcite .",
    "moves to the left and collides with a reflecting boundary at @xmath27 .",
    "initially the density of the reflected and incoming plasma adds up to @xmath26 .",
    "electrons stream out of the overlap layer due to their larger thermal speed .",

    "this downstream region is bounded by a forward shock and it expands due to ion accumulation .",
    "the upstream ions and electrons are heated up and compressed as they enter the downstream region .",
    "if all incoming ions enter the downstream region and mix with its plasma , then the shock is sub - critical .",
    "a fraction of the ions is reflected by a super - critical shock .",
    "they outrun the shock and form together with the incoming plasma the foreshock plasma .",
    "the upstream region is the one that has not yet been reached by shock - reflected ions .",
    "we employ a 1d simulation geometry , which separates the shock physics from that of secondary instabilities and simplifies the interpretation of the results .",
    "instabilities can be triggered by the counterstreaming ion beams in the foreshock with a relative speed that is larger than the ion acoustic speed .",
    "however , these instabilities can only develop if wave vectors are resolved that are oriented obliquely to the difference vector between the mean speeds of both ion beams @xcite .",
    "such vectors are excluded here by the alignment of the collision velocity vector with the simulation direction .",
    "the maximum shock speed is a few times the ion acoustic speed and thus much smaller than the electron thermal speed , which suppresses the buneman instability that can drive electrostatic waves with a beam - aligned wave vector @xcite .      a particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation code @xcite solves maxwell s equations together with the relativistic lorentz force equation for an ensemble of computational particles ( cps ) .",

    "[ run1](b ) and it shrinks with increasing @xmath19 to reach a few tens of @xmath105 for the highest collision speed . the second trend , which has already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the density of the shock - reflected ion beam increases .",

    "the mean electron thermal energy is only slightly elevated in the foreshock region in run 1 .",
    "the foreshock electrons get hotter with increasing @xmath19 and the typical thermal energy of electrons in the foreshock has more than doubled in run 6 compared to the value far upstream .",
    "the shock in run 6 thus moves through a plasma with an elevated sound speed since @xmath156 .",
    "this temperature rise is not large in our simulations .",
    "it can nevertheless be important because it is caused by the mixing of leaking downstream electrons that move upstream and upstream electrons that have been accelerated towards the shock by the foreshock potential .",
    "the energy available to the incoming upstream electrons is dominated by the bulk kinetic energy they gain in the foreshock potential and not by their thermal energy .",
    "the foreshock s electron temperature should thus be robust against changes of the electron temperature far upstream .",

    "we find that the temperature of the foreshock electrons is in all cases about 1/3 of the value in the downstream region .",
    "we have performed here a series of one - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of electrostatic shocks .",
    "the purpose has been to gain insight into the conditions under which such shocks form and into the structure of their transition layer for a wide range of shock speeds .",
    "these aspects are important in the context of supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks .",
    "their large nonrelativistic speeds exceed the ion acoustic speed in the ism by a factor @xmath163 .",
    "this factor is much larger than the limit @xmath164 for stable shocks , which is derived from various theoretical models @xcite .",
    "it is thus essential to know the degree to which the ism s temperature is important for snr shocks . in other words",
    ", can a shock , once it is present , generate the electron temperatures it needs to be stable ?",
    "this parametric study is also relevant for laboratory experiments .",
    "important questions are what kind of shocks can form during the limited time over which observations are possible and what properties these shocks have .",
    "our study addressed shocks in initially unmagnetized plasma that develop out of the collision of two equal plasma clouds at a speed that is less than 1% of the light speed @xmath165 .",
    "such shocks remain electrostatic because the low flow speeds yield only weak currents and magnetic fields . a speed in excess of @xmath166 results in the growth of magnetic fields @xcite",
    "that are strong enough to affect the shock dynamics and they become dominant at ultrarelativistic speeds even if the plasma was initially unmagnetized @xcite .",
    "the chosen collision speeds are realistic for the late expansion phase of snr blast shells . our parametric study has provided the following results .",
    "shocks form for the considered electron and ion temperatures up to a mach number @xmath167 2.5 .",
    "a shock with this mach number reflects practically all incoming ions and acts as a piston . raising the plasma collision speed by another 8% results in a shock - less interpenetration of the plasma clouds .",
    "slower shocks with a mach number @xmath168 form on electron time scales while the faster ones develop slower , typically during about 10 - 100 inverse ion plasma frequencies .",
    "the instability , which results in the formation of shocks , does not set in immediately after a collision of plasma clouds at a high speed and the formation time of the shock may be unpredictable .",
    "we can not exclude an eventual formation of a shock in our simulation that used the fastest collision speed .",
    "one possibility is that the ion acoustic instability , which can develop in multidimensional systems , pre - heats the plasma .",
    "the mach number of the flow is reduced by the increasing ion acoustic speed and a stable shock may eventually form .",
    "another shock formation mechanism is the destabilization of nonlinear plasma structures such as ion phase space holes that can trigger the formation of shocks even in very fast flows @xcite .",
    "the shock - reflected ion beam results in electron heating in all simulations .",
    "this heating is not caused by instabilities such as the buneman instability that is excluded here by the low relative flow speed between electrons and ions .",
    "it arises from the electron acceleration in the ambipolar electric field of the plasma density gradient .",
    "the foreshock electron temperature in our simulations has been about 1/3 of the electron temperature in the downstream plasma and it is probably independent of the upstream temperature .",
    "an electrostatic shock moves in this case through a medium with an ion sound speed that depends on the electron temperature in the post - shock plasma and on the density of the shock - reflected ion beam .",
    "the shock - reflected ion beam , which is essential for the electron pre - heating , implies that the shock must be super - critical .",
    "the difference between the electron temperature in the foreshock and in the upstream is moderate in our simulations and at solar system shocks . the difference can become significant at astrophysical shocks , where the post - shock electron temperature can be of the order of kev",
    "while that in the upstream is about 1 ev . a foreshock temperature of snr shocks that is a significant fraction of the downstream temperature implies that the mach number of snr shocks is in fact reduced by at least an order of magnitude compared to the least upper bound @xmath163 , which estimates the ion acoustic speed using the ism temperature @xmath169 ev .",
    "the shock does not convert instantly the directed flow energy of the upstream into downstream heat .",
    "the shock potential and the ion distribution gradually change over a spatial interval that can be large if the mach number is low , as our simulation shows .",
    "this has potentially important consequences for experimental observations of slow shocks .",
    "their potential jump between the downstream region and the foreshock is moderate and it falls off over hundreds of debye lengths .",
    "the electric field amplitude is thus low and smeared out over at least tens of debye lengths .",
    "slow shocks may thus not always be detectable in experiments that measure the electric field amplitude .",
    "finally our simulations have shown that the ions downstream have a bi - maxwellian velocity distribution and they are not in a thermal equilibrium .",
    "the shock - reflected ion beam is thus not the only process by which a supercritical shock can get rid of an excess flow energy of the upstream plasma .",
    "this aspect together with the non - maxwellian electron velocity distributions may help explaining why electrostatic shocks are stable even if electrons and ions have the same temperature , which is not possible according to some analytic models .",
