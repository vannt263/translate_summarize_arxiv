    "the ni - au alloy system is physically interesting because , on one hand it exhibits a phase separation tendency at low temperatures and _ positive _ mixing enthalpies @xcite and , on the other hand , an ordering - type short - range order ( sro ) at high temperatures .",
    "@xcite also , the fcc ni and au constituents possess a large lattice - mismatch ( @xmath5% ) , thus making this system a critical test for any alloy phase stability theory hoping to capture the effects of atomic relaxation .",
    "important early experimental and theoretical work on this alloy includes the work of moss _",
    "@xcite , cohen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and and cook and de fontaine @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of phase separation ( at low @xmath6 ) with short - range ordering ( at high @xmath6 ) in the same alloy system might have been naively construed to imply a change from repulsive ( `` ferromagnetic '' ) interactions at low @xmath6 to attractive ( `` anti - ferromagnetic '' ) interactions at higher @xmath6 .",
    "the change would have been surprising , given that no electronic , magnetic , or structural change is observed in this temperature range . the answer to this puzzle",
    "was given by lu and zunger : @xcite the excess energy for a disordered ni@xmath0au@xmath1 alloy or an ordered compound of type @xmath7 is given by : @xmath8,\\ ] ] and may be written @xcite @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the constant - volume , `` spin - flip '' energy required to create @xmath7 out of ni and au , each already prepared at the alloy lattice constant @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the volume deformation energy required to hydrostatically deform ni and au from their respective @xmath13 and @xmath14 to @xmath11 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is demonstrated that sro is determined by the constant volume energy change @xmath10 , which is negative ( ordering , or `` anti - ferromagnetic '' ) in ni - au , indicating an ordering tendency of sro .",
    "however , @xmath15 is large and positive , making @xmath16 . and , since long - range order is determined by @xmath17 , ni - au shows phase - separating ( `` ferromagnetic '' ) long - range order .",
    "this analysis leads to two unexpected conclusions : first , that the time - honored ising - like representation of alloy thermodynamics which includes only `` spin - flip '' energies of the @xmath10 type , but ignores the elastic energy @xmath18 will fail in explaining basic stability trends for systems such as ni - au .",
    "second , since measurements or calculations of the sro are insensitive to physical effects ( i.e. , elastic deformation @xmath12 ) that control measurements / calculations of mixing enthalpies @xmath17 , the often - used practice @xcite of `` inverting '' the sro profile to extract interaction energies that are then used to predict mixing enthalpies is _ fundamentally flawed_. specifically , inversion of the sro of ni - au will produce ordering - like interaction energies which , when used to calculate mixing enthalpies will produce ( ordering - like ) negative values , while the measured ones are strongly positive .",
    "@xcite    for these and other reasons , the theory of phase stability in ni - au has recently become quite popular @xcite ( table [ comp.niau ] ) .",
    "these calculations are distinguished by the methods used for ( i ) energetics ( @xmath6=0 k ) and ( ii ) statistics ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "energy calculations ( @xmath6=0 k ) for this system have been performed by a wide variety of techniques : first - principles calculations , both full - potential ( flapw @xcite and flmto@xcite ) and atomic - sphere - approximation ( lmto@xcite and asw@xcite ) , as well as semi - empirical ( eam@xcite ) and empirical potentials @xcite .",
    "there are significant variations in the computed energetics ( table [ comp.niau ] ) .",
    "statistics have been applied to these calculations using cluster expansions ( ce ) such as @xmath20-g @xcite , connolly - williams @xcite , and second - order expansions .",
    "@xcite    the purpose of this paper is thus three - fold :    _ first _",
    ", we would like to clarify the conflicting energetic and statistical results ( table [ comp.niau ] ) by computing `` state - of - the - art '' energetics for ni - au alloys ( full - potential lapw total energies including full atomic relaxation ) combined with `` state - of - the - art '' statistics ( a k - space ce @xcite with monte carlo simulations ) .",
    "these computations will clarify whether the better agreement with experimental @xmath17 obtained by approximated methods ( e.g. , empirical and semi - empirical potentials , as well as atomic - sphere - approximation methods ) relative to full lda methods is fundamental or accidental .",
    "_ second _ , we would like to address the issue of why the calculated miscibility gap temperatures are often much too high compared with the experimentally assessed phase diagram @xcite . in table [ comp.niau ] , one can see a fixed ratio between calculated miscibility gap temperatures @xmath21 and the calculated @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , all previous calculations ( except the eam calculations of asta and foiles @xcite ) very nearly follow the ratio obtained using mean - field configurational entropy : @xmath23",
    ". however , the _ experimental _ value of this ratio is 1.2 .",
    "we will examine this apparent discrepancy between experimental @xmath22 and @xmath21 below .",
    "_ third _ , we would like to examine the sro in ni - au and discuss the implications of this sro on `` inverse '' techniques , mentioned above , for calculating phase stability in alloys . we will offer a challenge to practitioners of the inverse monte carlo method .",
    "table [ comp.niau ] summarizes the previous calculations on the mixing enthalpies of random ni - au alloys .",
    "the wide discrepancy between calculated values of @xmath22 ( 48 - 170 mev / atom ) is apparent from this table . since mixing enthalpies @xmath22 of random alloys",
    "can be expressed [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( 3b ) in ref . ] as a linear combination of formation enthalpies @xmath24 of certain ordered compounds @xmath25 ,",
    "the discrepancies in @xmath22 must reflect discrepancies in @xmath24 .",
    "but formation enthalpies of small - unit - cell ordered compounds can be computed accurately and reliably via full - potential fully - relaxed lda methods .",
    "our strategy will thus be to trace the source of the discrepancy in @xmath22 to the values of formation energies of various ni@xmath26au@xmath27 ordered compounds , as shown in table [ comp.niau.ord ] . examining this table leads to several interesting points regarding the energetics in ni - au :      in comparing the full - potential lmto @xcite to lmto - asa @xcite calculations",
    ", one can see significant and strongly configuration - dependent discrepancies , _ even when considering unrelaxed configurations_. for example , the @xmath28 structure [ a ni@xmath29au@xmath29 ( 001 ) superlattice ] has an unrelaxed formation energy which is nearly 100 mev / atom lower in the lmto - asa calculation than in the full - potential lmto one .",
    "thus , the asa - based calculations ( lmto , asw ) in the ni - au system can not be trusted for the kind of quantitative energetics required in phase stability studies .",
    "@xcite      in a large lattice - mismatched system like ni - au , the effects of atomic relaxation are likely to be crucial .",
    "although straightforward , fully relaxing all of the cell - internal and cell - external degrees of freedom can be computer intensive .",
    "one alternative to full atomic relaxation ( using quantum mechanical forces and total energy minimization ) which has been used in ni - au @xcite is to use continuum elasticity theory @xcite to find the relaxed geometry , with a subsequent lda calculation with this geometry to find the relaxed energetics .",

    "nevertheless , anharmonic relaxation in ni - au alloys is large and can not be neglected .",
    "we see from table [ comp.niau ] that the methods that use empirical evaluations of @xmath59 @xcite produce results that are lower , and thus closer to the measured @xmath60 than methods that use converged , full potential , fully relaxed approaches ( i.e. , the present work and refs . ) . since there is a proportionality between @xmath22 and @xmath24",

    "table [ comp.niau.ord ] shows the formation energies of two of the empirical potential methods . by comparing these numbers to full - potential lda energies",
    ", one can see that the _ empirical potentials systematically underestimate the formation energies of ordered compounds_. since the lda method is expected to reproduce formation enthalpies of small - unit - cell ordered structures rather accurately , and since flapw gives a precise representation of the lda , we think that the underestimation of flapw energies by the empirical methods is a rather serious limitation of these methods .",
    "the eam of ref . was fit to the unrelaxed flapw calculations of ref .",

    "thus , we can obtain an estimate of the _ non - configurational _ entropy , and find it to be large : @xmath121 .",
    "this non - configurational entropy is hence responsible for @xmath21 being so small experimentally , compared to all the theoretical results . in fact , if we use the calculated @xmath22 = 93 mev / atom and the combined `` experimental / calculated '' @xmath122 = 0.48@xmath123 in the following formula : @xmath124 we obtain @xmath125 k and @xmath126 , much closer to the experimental values ( @xmath127 k and @xmath128 ) than using the above formula neglecting non - configurational entropy ( @xmath129 k and @xmath130 ) .    from this consideration of non - configurational effects , one should conclude that the accuracy of a calculation with configurational degrees of freedom only ( as is done in most of the previous calculations @xcite ) , should be determined by looking at the _ energetics _ , not the _ transition temperatures_. thus , previous calculations which give `` good '' transition temperatures do so precisely because they have `` bad '' energetics .      using the * k*-space",
    "ce and monte carlo , we may also compute the sro of disordered ni@xmath0au@xmath1 alloys .",
    "we show the results of our sro simulations for ni@xmath131au@xmath132 in fig .",
    "[ niau.sro ] . for",
    "the sro monte carlo calculations , a cell of 24@xmath111=13824 atoms was used , with 100 monte carlo steps for equilibration , with averages taken over the subsequent 500 steps .",
    "several calculations and measurements of the sro exist in the literature : wu and cohen @xcite used diffuse x - ray scattering to deduce the atomic sro of ni@xmath131au@xmath132 at @xmath6=1023 k. the measured diffuse intensity due to sro must be separated from all the other contributions which give rise to diffuse intensity , and for this purpose , wu and cohen used 25 real - space fourier shells of sro parameters , and found the rather surprising result that the peak intensity in reciprocal space due to sro is of ordering - type and occurs at the point @xmath133=(0.6,0,0 ) , rather than @xmath133=(0,0,0 ) which would be expected for a clustering alloy .",
    "several authors have tried to account for this ordering nature of the sro : lu and zunger @xcite calculated the sro ( using 21 real - space shells ) and found peaks at @xmath3(0.8,0,0 ) whereas asta and foiles @xcite used an embedded atom method and found the sro ( using 8 real - space shells ) to peak at @xmath3(0.5,0,0 ) .",
    "our calculations for the sro of ni@xmath131au@xmath132 are given in fig .",
    "[ niau.sro ] .",
    "we have calculated the sro at @xmath6=2300 k , above the miscibility gap temperature for our alloy hamiltonian .",
    "we find that , using 8 , 25 , and 100 shells , the sro peaks at ( 0.65,0,0 ) , ( 0.40,0,0 ) , and ( 0.38,0,0 ) respectively , in good agreement with both the measurements of wu and cohen [ @xmath133=(0.6,0,0 ) for 25 shells ] and also with previous calculations .",
    "equation ( [ eform.ce ] ) shows that the alloy hamiltonian used in the monte carlo simulations is composed of three parts : the pair interaction terms , the multibody interaction terms , and the constituent strain terms .",
    "it is interesting to see the effect of each of these portions of the alloy hamiltonian on sro .",
    "thus , in addition to the `` full '' calculations , which contain pairs , multibodies , and constituent strain in the alloy hamiltonian , we have also computed the sro with ( i ) the cs energy only , and ( ii ) the cs energy plus the pair interactions .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ niau.sro.cs ] .",
    "( because the cs energy is non - analytic in reciprocal space about the origin , many fourier coefficients are required to converge the sro of cs alone , thus we show only results using 100 shells of parameters in fig .",
    "[ niau.sro.cs ] . )",
    "one can see that the sro with cs only is dominated by almost constant streaks of intensity along the @xmath134 line , and very little intensity elsewhere .",
    "this sro pattern is understandable when one considers that the constituent strain at this composition ( fig .",
    "[ niau.cs ] ) is much softer ( much lower in energy ) in the ( 100 ) direction than along any other direction .",
    "thus , ( 100)-type fluctuations in the random alloy are be energetically favored , and because the constituent strain is dependent only on direction and not on the length of the wavevector , one should expect that all fluctuations along the ( 100 ) will occur roughly equally , regardless of the length of the wavevector .",
    "this is precisely what we see in fig .",
    "[ niau.sro.cs ] . contrasting this",
    "sro using cs only with that calculated both cs energy and pair interactions ( but not multibody interactions ) shows that the pair interactions create a peak in intensity along the @xmath134 line , but significantly closer to @xmath135 than the peak intensity using the `` full '' alloy hamiltonian .",
    "thus , while the effect of pairs is to create a peak near the @xmath135 point , the multibody interactions move this peak out from @xmath135 towards the @xmath136-point .    [",
    "[ standard - inverse - monte - carlo - would - give - unphysical - interaction - energies - a - challenge ] ] standard inverse monte carlo would give unphysical interaction energies : a challenge ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the statistical problem we have solved here involves the calculation of the alloy sro at high temperature for given alloy hamiltonian ( @xmath137 , @xmath102 , and @xmath138 ) .",
    "however , a popular technique used to study phase stability in alloys involves the `` inverse '' problem of determining a set of pair - only interactions @xmath139 from a measured or calculated sro pattern , and the subsequent use of these pair interactions to determine thermodynamic properties other than the sro .",
    "in fact , @xmath139 are often used to determine @xmath22 or phase stability . as we have mentioned in the introduction and described more fully in ref . ,",
    "inverting the sro always removes information on energy terms that are sro - independent , e.g. , the volume deformation energy @xmath18 .",
    "this loss prevents , in principle , the interactions deduced from sro from being applied to predict physical properties which depend on @xmath18 , such as @xmath22 . for example , in the case of ni - au , the sro is of ordering - type .",
    "thus , we expect that inverting the sro of ni - au ( e.g. , via inverse monte carlo ) would produce interactions @xmath139 which are of ordering - type , and using these interactions to predict the mixing enthalpy would result in the unphysical result @xmath140 .",
    "one might suspect that by changing the temperature , one could obtain a shift of the sro from ordering- to clustering - type , and thus , the inverse technique would then produce interactions which would correctly give @xmath141 .",
    "however , we have computed the sro for several temperatures , and find no evidence of a shift in sro to clustering - type .    a test of our expectations by any of the practitioners of inverse monte carlo would certainly be welcomed .",
    "to that end , our sro calculations are available for use as input to inverse monte carlo to extract interactions .",
    "these sro calculations are available for a variety of compositions and temperatures , each with a large number of real - space sro parameters .",
    "it would be of great interest to see whether the interactions extracted from inverting the sro of ni - au would produce the correct sign of @xmath22 .",
