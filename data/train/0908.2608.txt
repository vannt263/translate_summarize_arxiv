    "graphene consists of a monolayer of a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms .",
    "it has been studied theoretically since the early work of wallace.@xcite an important aspect of the charge dynamics in graphene is that it is governed by a dirac rather than a schrdinger equation .",
    "fermionic energies are proportional to momentum with the effective speed of light @xmath5 m/s .",
    "while the material was isolated experimentally only in 2004,@xcite many fascinating discoveries have already appeared@xcite including an integer quantum hall effect with half integer filling factors , a minimum conductivity and a berry phase shift of @xmath6.@xcite    an important dimension in the study of graphene is that it can be incorporated into a field effect device@xcite and doped away from half filling by changing the gate voltage .",
    "this means that the position of the chemical potential can be varied with respect to the dirac point where conical valence and conduction band meet at two specific @xmath7 points in the brillouin zone . as is the case in ordinary metals the electron - phonon interaction@xcite ( epi ) renormalizes the bare bands and changes the properties of graphene .",
    "here we consider specifically the electronic density of states ( dos ) . in metals , where the dos is essentially energy independent on the scale of phonon energies ,",
    "a well - known result is that the electron - phonon self - energy entirely drops out of the problem and the dos retains its bare value . in graphene ,",
    "as we will show in this paper , this is no longer the case and there is an imprint of the epi in the renormalized dos .",
    "this is expected in systems where the dos varies on an energy scale comparable to phonon energies.@xcite it also arises in finite band systems , with the top and the bottom of the band are modified in a particularly important way by interactions with the phonons.@xcite    another known result in simple metals is that the epi renormalizations@xcite drop out of the dc value of the conductivity but significantly renormalize its ac value and phonon - assisted holstein processes become possible . for graphene the dc conductivity which is due to both intra and interband transitions",
    "is also unaffected by the epi .",
    "however , the intraband ac drude contribution has its optical spectral weight reduced by a factor of ( @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 is the effective mass renormalization parameter ( dependent on value of the chemical potential ) , and its scattering rate is also reduced by the same factor .",
    "optical spectral weight is shifted to phonon - assisted holstein side bands originating from the incoherent part of the electron spectral density .",
    "the interband transitions , which are strongly suppressed by pauli blocking below twice the renormalized chemical potential , also exhibit phonon - assisted side bands which add on to the intraband holstein processes at photon energies above the phonon energy .",
    "the universal value of the background conductivity at higher energies is suppressed below its bare band value @xmath10 .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model of park et al.@xcite for the electron - phonon interaction in graphene which we write in a more general form so as to include the self - consistent electronic density of states ( dos ) in the self - energy itself .",
    "iterations of the self - energy to obtain a self - consistent value of the dos is known to be important in finite bands particularly in the region of the band edge .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction renormalizes the electronic motion at the fermi surface through a renormalization factor ( @xmath8).@xcite in addition , the chemical potential is changed from its bare band value as is the relative position of the dirac point . in the limit of small chemical potential ,",
    "analytic formulas are obtained for these renormalizations and are compared with more general numerical results .",
    "our results for the renormalized dos show phonon signatures at small energies and a renormalization of the band edge with renormalized bands no longer ending abruptly as in the bare band .",
    "an analytic formula is derived for the modification of the dirac point due to interactions .",
    "in section iii , we consider more specifically phonon structure in the renormalized dos , a topic on which we have some preliminary and complementary work.@xcite to this end , we introduce a lorentzian model for the phonon distribution instead of the simple einstein model of park et al.@xcite this provides a more realistic description of the structure that is expected to be seen in experiment.@xcite to see this structure more clearly , we take a first derivative and find that the lorentzian line shape of our assumed boson spectrum is faithfully reproduced in these plots except for a small shift in energy .",
    "section iv deals with aspects of quasiparticle renormalization as they show up in angle resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes).@xcite we particularly emphasize the shift in chemical potential@xcite revealed in such curves and note that electron - phonon renormalizations remain to high energies .",
    "section v deals with optical conductivity@xcite starting with the effect of the electron - phonon renormalization on the low frequency conductivity .",
    "we begin with the dc conductivity which is found to be unrenormalized .",
    "conditions for the observation of the universal limit are discussed and the contribution to this value of intra and interband transitions are separately determined .",
    "the rise of the conductivity @xmath11 from its universal dc to its universal ac background value@xcite with increasing frequency @xmath12 is described .",
    "analytic formulas are provided for the electron - phonon renormalization that arises for finite doping when @xmath13 is much larger than the impurity scattering rate @xmath0 .",
    "we find that in this case , the intraband transitions provide a drude - like contribution to the conductivity which , just as is known to be the case in ordinary metals,@xcite is renormalized by the mass enhancement factor ( @xmath8 ) in two ways . the effective plasma frequency of the drude as compared to its free band case is reduced by @xmath14 and the scattering rate @xmath0 also goes into @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , optical spectral weight is transferred into holstein phonon - assisted absorption sidebands . on the other hand and in sharp contrast",
    ", the interband transitions at small @xmath12 remain unrenormalized but beyond the phonon energy also exhibit holstein sidebands . in section vii , the infrared region of the conductivity@xcite",
    "is considered more explicitly with the specific aim of understanding separately the role played by intra and interband transitions .",
    "it is explained how interband transitions which would be pauli blocked in the pure bare band case can nevertheless take place in the interacting system although with reduced spectral weight .",
    "this arises because in the interacting system bloch states are never occupied with probability one and so pauli blocking is not complete .",
    "the partial sum rule on the optical conductivity is discussed .",
    "section viii contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "in graphene , the massless dirac nature of the electrons means that their energy ( @xmath16 ) is linear in momentum ( @xmath17 ) and consists of two branches , i.e. , @xmath18 with the velocity @xmath19 equal to about @xmath20 m / sec and @xmath21 the wave vector measured from one of the two @xmath7 points in the brillouin zone where valence and conduction bands meet .",

    "[ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] .",
    "( 250,200 )    another feature to be noted when considering fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , is the contrast between top and bottom frame for which @xmath49 goes from a value of 150 mev , which is less than @xmath28 mev , to a value of @xmath185 mev which is larger .",

    "we can immediately see from ( [ eq : nkapprox ] ) that the jump in occupation at the fermi surface in the interacting system at @xmath29 has been reduced below one by the factor @xmath14 .",

    "in addition , this curve has very significant tails beyond the fermi level and at negative energies below this point , the probability of occupation remains reduced from the value of 1 on the scale of ev reflecting the fact that phonon renormalizations persist to high energies in graphene as we saw in fig .",
    "thus since @xmath276 is always less than 1 , pauli blocking is lifted on interband transitions .",

    "[ fig18 ] , where the large black arrow represents the case where the particle is promoted to above the fermi level , which would be a transition with minimum energy @xmath254 .",
    "however , the finite probability for holes to exist below the fermi level gives rise to transitions such as shown by the short red arrow , and interband absorption can now proceed for energies which are less that @xmath254 .",

    "[ fig15 ] shows this to be true for a considerable range of energy above @xmath210 .",

    "the black and red curves have effectively merged and the optical spectral weight redistribution brought about by the epi is in balance at this point . at larger energies @xmath296 ev ,",

    "thus in optical experiments , spectral weight is removed below the bare optical cut off which is transferred to higher energies .",
    "the slight reduction below one of the universal background is generic and we would expect it to be a feature of interactions in general .",
    "( 250,200 )",
    "it is well known@xcite that in wide band metals for which the band density of states ( dos ) is essentially constant on the scale of a few times a phonon energy , the electron - phonon interaction drops out of the renormalized dos . because of the dirac nature of electron dynamics in graphene the bare band dos is linear in energy rather than constant and consequently an image of the phonons",
    "is retained in its dressed dos and a first derivative of @xmath40 provides an ideal baseline to study boson structures . for a bare dirac band",
    "this derivative gives minus or plus one with the change in sign occurring at @xmath125 , i.e. at minus the bare chemical potential which also coincides with the dirac point .",
    "several modifications arise when the electron - phonon interaction is included .",
    "first , the dirac point position is shifted and this leads to a change in the energy of the jump from minus to plus one in the first derivative .",
    "this jump remains sharp provided the chemical potential is in magnitude smaller than the phonon energy .",
    "but when the electron - phonon lifetime is finite at the dirac point , the jump becomes smeared .",
    "in addition there are structures at @xmath297 for an einstein spectrum .",
    "when a distributed phonon spectrum is used , the structure in @xmath178 reflects not only its magnitude but also it shape .",
    "with increasing doping or more precisely magnitude of chemical potential , the phonon structures are enhanced because the fermi level falls in a region of higher density of states and consequently of larger strength of the effective electron - phonon interaction . a point of note",
    "is that at the dirac point , the explicit logarithmic phonon structures of the finite doping case disappear , although the dos still retains its @xmath103 mass renormalization .",
    "small features remain in the derivative and there is some evidence from stm@xcite for both of these effects in this limit .",
    "the method should be applicable to other scattering mechanisms such as electron - hole and plasma excitations .",
    "another relevant observation is that in the dos , we find that for @xmath135 , the interactions lift the dirac point from a value of zero in the bare case to a finite value , and that the dos rises quadratically rather than linearly out of this point .",
    "this is due to a finite scattering rate at the dirac point .",
    "recent stm experiments@xcite appear to see this feature of lifting and accompanying quadratic behavior .",
    "further investigation of this point would be warranted .",
    "we have considered separately the effect of the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) on the intra and interband contributions to the optical conductivity .",
    "we find that the dc conductivity remains unrenormalized with equal contributions from both processes when the chemical potential is zero . with increasing doping through application of a gate voltage in a field effect device or by seeding the graphene surface with potassium or other atoms ,",
    "the interband contribution decreases and becomes negligible when the transport scattering rate @xmath219 becomes much smaller than the chemical potential .",

    "also , interband transitions , not part of the theory of simple metals , provide additional absorption . at small frequencies below twice the value of the chemical potential @xmath303",
    "there is a small but finite nearly frequency independent interband absorption which shows an additional holstein side band for the case @xmath304 ( the phonon energy ) , with an additional rapid increase towards its universal background value @xmath10 at @xmath305 .",
    "the near constant interband absorption below @xmath254 can be traced to a lifting of pauli blocking brought about by the epi .",
    "the interactions decrease the probability of occupation of a plane wave state below the fermi energy to a value less than one so that such states can still be used as final states for interband transitions although these are greatly reduced in optical spectral weight . in pure graphene",
    ", the increase in conductivity at @xmath306 represents a vertical jump from 0 to @xmath4 . when the epi is included not only does the chemical potential shift to a smaller value but the jump at @xmath254 is also smeared due to finite lifetime effects . while at small frequencies in the drude region the conductivity can exceed its background value @xmath4 , for energies greater than @xmath254 it is always slightly _ smaller _ than @xmath4 .",
    "consideration of the partial optical sum rule shows that missing optical spectral weight at high energy is transferred to even higher energies as compared to the bare band case because the epi provides states beyond the bare band cutoff on the scale of the phonon energy .",
