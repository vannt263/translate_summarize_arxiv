    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are short , intense and non - repeating flashes of @xmath1-ray radiation originating at cosmological distances .",
    "while grbs exhibit a broad diversity in their prompt @xmath1-ray emission ( e.g. , duration , spectral shape , peak energy , brightness ) , they can still be divided into two basic categories : short - duration and long - duration with a separation at about 2 sec @xcite .",
    "the short grbs have durations as short as @xmath2 msec , while the long events extend to hundreds of seconds .",
    "in addition , short grbs tend to exhibit harder @xmath1-ray spectra than the long - duration events , and generally have a lower fluences .",
    "the basic bimodality of grb durations provided an early clue that the progenitors of the two classes are likely to be distinct . within the broad range of possible scenarios ,",
    "two popular models have emerged : the collapse of rapidly - rotating massive stars ( `` collapsars '' ; @xcite ) in the case of long grbs , and the coalescence of compact object binaries ( with neutron star and/or black hole constituents  ns - ns / ns - bh ; @xcite ) in the case of short grbs .",
    "the key attractions of this mapping are the potential for a large energy release from both progenitor classes , and the expected typical timescale for each progenitor : a free - fall timescale of @xmath3 for collapsars , and a dynamical timescale of milliseconds for the compact merger remnants of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "however , other progenitor systems have also been proposed for short grbs , for example magnetars , thought to be the power source behind soft @xmath1-ray repeaters @xcite , accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of neutron stars @xcite , and delayed magnetar formation through binary white dwarf mergers or white dwarf aic @xcite .    until a decade ago , the distances , energy scale , geometry , environments , and progenitors of grbs , as well as the relation between the two burst classes , remained uncertain due to the lack of precise positions .",
    "the discovery of long - wavelength , long - lived `` afterglows '' from long grbs in 1997 provided the first glimpse at these properties @xcite .",
    "indeed , the sub - arcsecond positions enabled by long grb afterglow detections demonstrated a cosmological origin @xcite , an energy scale of @xmath4 erg @xcite , significant collimation ( @xmath5 jets ; @xcite ) , and direct evidence for relativistic expansion @xcite . intense afterglow and host galaxy observations also linked long grbs with the deaths of massive stars , mainly through their exclusive location in star forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , their strong correlation with the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) light of their hosts @xcite , and their association with type ic core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "the afterglows of short grbs were discovered only in 2005 .",
    "prior to that point only a few afterglow searches were possible due to the relative faintness of the @xmath1-ray emission , and hence a low event rate and large and delayed error circles @xcite .",
    "in retrospect , these searches were woefully inadequate , reaching only about 21 mag at @xmath6 day in the optical and @xmath7 mjy at @xmath8 days in the radio .",
    "the launch of nasa s _ swift _ satellite in late 2004 , provided the first chance for rapid and accurate positions for short grbs , and indeed led to the detection of the first x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite , and radio @xcite afterglows in 2005 .",
    "as in the case of long grbs , the determination of accurate positions revolutionized the study of short grbs .",
    "first , it led to an association with galaxies at cosmological distances ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hence an energy scale of @xmath9 erg ( assuming isotropy ) @xcite .",
    "second , it led to the association of some events with elliptical galaxies pointing to an old progenitor population @xcite .",
    "third , it demonstrated that the afterglow emission is similar to that of long grbs , albeit with a generally lower luminosity @xcite .",
    "finally , it provided a rough estimate of the short grb event rate @xcite .",
    "_ despite these fundamental results the progenitors of short grbs remain unidentified at the present .",
    "_ the key observational test of the ns - ns / ns - bh merger model , the detection of coincident gravitational waves , is at least several years away .",
    "similarly , theoretical predictions of early optical / uv emission from an accompanying `` mini - supernova '' @xcite , caused by the ejection of radioactive material from the merging system , are highly uncertain , and even the most optimistic predictions lead to a faint and rapidly - fading signal that may be challenging to detect .",
    "thus , the most promising avenue for progress at the present comes from statistical studies of the environments of short grbs , both on galactic and sub - galactic scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies benefit from many of the same techniques that linked long grbs with the death of massive stars , and allow for comparison with theoretical predictions .    in this review ,",
    "i present the current state of our knowledge about the redshift distribution of short grbs , the demographics and detailed properties of their host galaxies , and their locations within their hosts .",
    "the structure of this review is as follows . in  [",
    "sec : disc ] i summarize the discovery of short grb afterglows , and the subsequent identifications of their host galaxies and redshifts ; the detailed properties of the hosts ( luminosities , metallicities , star formation rates , masses , stellar population ages ) are discussed in  [ sec : hosts ] and  [ sec : hosts2 ] ; in  [ sec : hst ] i discuss the sub - galactic environments of short grbs , utilizing mainly high - resolution _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations ; i discuss the possibility of large progenitor offsets ( due to kicks or globular cluster origin ) in  [ sec : kicks ] ; and finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] i use these results to place constraints on the progenitor population .",
    "the discovery of short grb afterglows starting in may 2005 led to the first identifications of their host galaxies and hence to distance measurements .",
    "the first short grb with an afterglow detection , grb050509b , was localized to a positional accuracy of about @xmath10 with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) @xcite .",
    "no optical or radio emission was detected .",
    "the x - ray error circle appeared to coincide with the outskirts of an elliptical galaxy at @xmath11 @xcite , with a probability of chance coincidence of @xmath12 .",
    "however , the error circle contained additional fainter galaxies possibly at higher redshift .",
    "only two months later , grb050709 was the first short burst localized to sub - arcsecond precision through the detection of x - ray ( with _ chandra _ ) and optical emission @xcite .",
    "the resulting afterglow position coincided with the outskirts of an irregular star forming galaxy at @xmath13 @xcite . despite the on - going star formation activity within the host galaxy ,",
    "the burst was not accompanied by a supernova explosion , indicating that the progenitor was not likely to be a massive star @xcite . however , due to the presence of active star formation , an association with a young progenitor system such as a magnetar could not be excluded .",
    "it was only 15 days later that the discovery of x - ray , optical , and for the first time radio afterglow emission finally established a direct link between a short grb and an old stellar population @xcite .",
    "the afterglow of grb050724 was localized to an elliptical galaxy at @xmath14 with no evidence for star formation activity ( @xmath15 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 ) and with a stellar population age of @xmath18 gyr @xcite .",
    "the absence of both star formation activity and an associated supernova demonstrated a direct link to an old stellar population @xcite .",
    "the combination of low redshifts ( @xmath19 ) and the apparent dominance of elliptical galaxies in the first few short grb hosts led to initial speculation of a particularly old progenitor population : @xmath20 gyr @xcite , @xmath21 gyr @xcite , and @xmath22 gyr @xcite . indeed , a possible inconsistency with the expected merger time delay distribution of ns - ns binaries was noted @xcite , although subsequent population synthesis models of ns - ns binary formation and mergers led to opposite claims @xcite . clearly , the sample of short grbs with afterglow detections available when these various claims were published was very small ( grbs 050509b , 050709 , 050724 , and 051221a ) .     on a side , with the exception of grb060502b which is twice as large .",

    "arrows mark the positions of the identified hosts . from @xcite.,width=336 ]    .",
    "also indicated are the star formation rates inferred from the luminosity of the [ oii]@xmath23 doublet . from @xcite.,width=336 ]    fortunately , the continued detection of short grbs ( mainly , though not exclusively by _ swift _ ) , coupled with a community - wide concerted effort to discover and study their afterglows , led to a substantial increase in the sample of events over the past 5 years ( e.g. , figures  [ fig:070724 ] and [ fig : hosts ] ) .",
    "studies of this sample have led to a re - evaluation of the host galaxy demographics and the redshift distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , as of late 2010 , the sample of short grbs with x - ray detections ( positions of @xmath24 radius ) numbers about 40 . of these",
    ", about 20 events have been detected in the optical / uv / near - ir and/or radio , leading to positional uncertainties of @xmath25 .",
    "host galaxies have been identified for nearly all of the bursts with sub - arcsecond positions ( 15/20 ) , and putative hosts have also been identified for a substantial fraction of the bursts with only x - ray positions ( when deep searches have been made ) . at the present , 16 redshifts have been measured between the two samples ( figures  [ fig : zs ] and [ fig : z ] ) .",
    "radius).,width=336 ]    the events with only x - ray positions have two shortcomings .",
    "first , the probability of chance coincidence for the typical host magnitudes within the xrt error circles ( @xmath26 mag ) is @xmath27 .",
    "second , in some cases there is disagreement about the position and radius of the xrt error circles between various groups , leading to systematic uncertainties in host associations .",
    "luckily , in the subsequent discussion of detailed host properties no substantial difference in the sample with and without optical afterglows is found , suggesting that any spurious galaxy associations are at most a minor contaminant .",

    "the isotropic - equivalent relativistic energies are as least as high as @xmath31 erg , and may approach @xmath32 erg for some short bursts . from @xcite.,width=336 ]    using optical follow - up observations of nine short grbs with x - ray and/or optical afterglows ( available by the end of 2006 ) , @xcite found that eight of the nine bursts were likely associated with much fainter galaxies ( @xmath33 mag ) than the first few events .",
    "by comparison to this early sample ( with @xmath34 mag and @xmath35 ) , as well as the hosts of long grbs and large field galaxy samples , it was demonstrated that these new host galaxies likely reside at @xmath36 and beyond .",
    "a specific early case for a @xmath37 origin was grb060121 based on afterglow photometric redshift estimates @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts for the four _ brightest _ galaxies in this expanded sample led to measurements of @xmath38 @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : zs ] .",
    "subsequent observations have confirmed a broad range of redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the current redshift distribution ( in comparison to that of long grbs ) is shown in figure  [ fig : z ] .",
    "one of the crucial ramifications of the measured redshift distribution is the energy budget of the @xmath1-ray emission and blastwave . in figure",
    "[ fig : eglx ] i show the isotropic - equivalent afterglow x - ray luminosities of short grbs as a function of their isotropic - equivalent @xmath1-ray energies .",
    "the former is a proxy for the afterglow kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "i find that both quantities span several orders of magnitude , with @xmath39 erg ( although most short bursts have values of @xmath40 erg ) .",
    "this range is similar to that for long grbs @xcite , and indicates that either short grbs can truly produce a broad range of energies , or instead exhibit a wide range of collimation angles . due to the general faintness of short grb afterglows ,",
    "strong evidence for collimation exists in only one case @xcite , but additional cases are possible @xcite .",
    "the secure association of at least one short grb ( 050724 ) with an elliptical galaxy @xcite demonstrated unambiguously that some of the progenitors are related to an old stellar population .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous section , a substantial fraction of short grbs ( @xmath41 ) reside at higher redshifts than initially suspected , @xmath36 @xcite , and spectroscopic observations indicate that most of these galaxies are undergoing active star formation ( figure  [ fig : zs ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in the sample of short grbs localized to better than a few arcseconds about @xmath42 of the bursts occur in star forming galaxies compared to only @xmath43 in elliptical galaxies ; the remaining @xmath44 are currently unclassified due to their faintness , a lack of obvious spectroscopic features , or the absence of deep follow - up observations .",
    "this result raises the question of whether some short grbs are related to star formation activity rather than to an old stellar population , and if so , whether the star formation properties are similar to those in long grb host galaxies .",
    "the answer will shed light on the diversity of short grb progenitors .",

    "i compare several aspect of short and long grb host galaxies : luminosities , metallicities , and star formation rates .",
    "a comparison of the masses and stellar population ages is carried out in the subsequent section .",
    "for the current sample of short grb hosts , the distribution of absolute rest - frame @xmath46-band magnitudes ( @xmath47 ) ranges from about @xmath48 to a few @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the star formation rates ( mostly inferred from the @xmath50}\\lambda 3727 $ ] line using the standard conversion @xcite ; figure  [ fig : zs ] ) range from about @xmath48 to @xmath51 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 for the star forming hosts @xcite . in the case of the elliptical hosts the upper limits are @xmath52 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 @xcite . combined with the absolute magnitudes , the specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) are @xmath53 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 @xmath54 for the star forming hosts , and @xmath55 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 @xmath54 for the elliptical hosts .",
    "the ssfr values as a function of redshift are shown in figure  [ fig : ssfr ] .    for five host galaxies in the current sample , there is also sufficient spectral information to measure the metallicity @xcite .",

    "i note that the @xmath58 diagnostic is double - valued with low and high metallicity branches ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "for the host of grb051221a @xcite , similar values to those for the host of grb070724 are inferred .",

    "the gray bars mark the @xmath71 percentile range for galaxies at @xmath72 from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , while red crosses designate the same field galaxies at @xmath73 shown in figure  [ fig : ssfr ] @xcite .",
    "both field samples exhibit a clear luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "the long grb hosts tend to exhibit lower than expected metallicities @xcite , while the hosts of short grbs have higher metallicities by about 0.6 dex , are moreover in excellent agreement with the luminosity - metallicity relation . from @xcite.,width=336 ]    to place the host galaxies of short grbs in a broader context i compare their properties with those of long grb hosts and field star forming galaxies from the goods - n survey @xcite . in terms of absolute magnitudes ,",
    "the long grb hosts range from @xmath74 to @xmath75 mag , with a median value of @xmath76 mag ( @xmath77 @xmath49 ; @xcite ) . thus",
    ", the long grb hosts extend to lower luminosities than the short grb hosts , with a median value that is about 1.1 mag fainter .",

    "a comparison to the goods - n sample reveals a similar distribution , and the k - s probability that the short grb hosts are drawn from the field sample is 0.6 @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached based on a comparison of specific star formation rates @xcite . for long grb hosts the inferred star formation rates range from about 0.2 to 50 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 , and their specific star formation rates are about @xmath78 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 @xmath54 , with a median value of about 10 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ssfr ] , the specific star formation rates of short grb hosts are systematically below those of long grb hosts , with a median value that is nearly an order of magnitude lower .",
    "indeed , the k - s probability that the short and long grb hosts are drawn from the same underlying distribution is only @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this is clearly seen from the cumulative distributions of specific star formation rates for each sample ( inset of figure  [ fig : ssfr ] ) . on the other hand",

    "the k - s probability that the short grb hosts are drawn from the field galaxy distribution is 0.6 .",
    "thus , short grb hosts appear to be drawn from the normal population of star forming galaxies at @xmath80 , in contrast to long grb hosts , which have elevated specific star formation rates , likely as a result of preferentially young starburst populations @xcite .",
    "finally , the metallicities measured for short grb hosts are in excellent agreement with the luminosity - metallicity relation for field galaxies at @xmath81 ( figure  [ fig : lz ] ; @xcite ) . the two hosts with @xmath82 mag have @xmath83 , while those with @xmath84 to @xmath85 mag have @xmath86 , following the general trend . on the other hand ,",
    "the short grb host metallicities are systematically higher than those of long grb hosts , which have been argued to have lower than expected values @xcite .",
    "the median metallicity of short grb hosts is about 0.6 dex higher than for long grb hosts , and there is essentially no overlap between the two host populations @xcite .    to conclude ,",
    "the short grb host sample is dominated by star forming galaxies , but these galaxies have higher luminosities , lower star formation rates and specific star formation rates , and higher metallicities than the star forming host galaxies of long grbs .",
    "instead , the short grb host sample appears to be drawn from the field galaxy population .",
    "these results suggest that while short grb hosts are mainly star forming galaxies , the progenitors most likely trace stellar mass rather than the modest on - going star formation activity .",
    "to more comprehensively address whether short grbs trace stellar mass alone ( as would be expected for an old progenitor population ) , it is essential to determine the stellar masses and population ages of short grb host galaxies , primarily in comparison to the general galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "this analysis was recently carried out by @xcite using multi - band optical and near - ir data for 19 short grb hosts .",
    "the resulting spectral energy distributions were fit with the @xcite stellar population models to extract two crucial parameters : stellar mass ( @xmath87 ) and population age ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the range of possible masses was assessed using three approaches .",
    "first , using single stellar population ( ssp ) fits , which provide an adequate representation for the early - type hosts , but tend to under - estimate the total mass and population age of star - forming hosts .",
    "at the other extreme , the near - ir data alone were modeled with a stellar population matched to the age of the universe at each host redshift .",
    "this approach uses the maximum possible mass - to - light ratio to extract a maximal mass for each host galaxy . finally , as a more realistic estimate for the star - forming hosts , hybrid young+old stellar populations were used .",
    "examples of all three approaches are shown for the host of grb050709 in figure  [ fig:050709 ] .",
    "the resulting mass distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : masses ] .",
    "for comparison i also present the mass distributions for long grb hosts , which were analyzed with the same models for the purpose of a uniform comparison .",
    "the ssp masses span three orders of magnitude , @xmath89 m@xmath16 , with a median value of @xmath90 m@xmath16 . dividing the sample into early- and late - type host galaxies , the former span the range @xmath91 m@xmath16 ,",
    "while the latter have much lower masses of @xmath92 m@xmath16 . the clear distinction between the two samples partially reflects the bias of single age ssp models , which for the late - type hosts are dominated by the young stellar population and hence under - estimate the contribution of any older stellar populations . for the maximal masses",
    "the range is @xmath93 m@xmath16 .",
    "the median mass is @xmath94 m@xmath16 , about an order of magnitude larger than for the single age ssp masses , and only slightly larger than the stellar mass of the milky way .",
    "as expected , the ratios of maximal to ssp masses for the early - type hosts are modest , @xmath95 , since these hosts are already dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "however , for the late - type hosts the corrections are significant , @xmath96 , with a median ratio of about an order of magnitude . finally , using the young+old models for the late - type hosts , and the single age ssp values for the early - type hosts , the resulting masses are @xmath97 m@xmath16 , with a median of @xmath98 m@xmath16 .    , title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    stellar population ages can only be inferred for the single age ssp models since for the maximal and young+old models the inherent assumption is a population with the age of the universe at each host redshift .",
    "the distribution of ages is shown in figure  [ fig : ages ] , with the values ranging from about 30 myr to 4.4 gyr .",
    "the median age is @xmath99 gyr for the full sample , with @xmath100 gyr for the subset of late - type hosts and @xmath101 gyr for the subset of early - type hosts .    ,",
    "width=336 ]    the long grb hosts , on the other hand , have lower masses and younger population ages . for the ssp model",
    "the mass range is @xmath102 m@xmath16 , with a median value of @xmath103 m@xmath16 ( figure  [ fig : masses ] ) .",
    "the maximal masses span @xmath104 m@xmath16 , with a median value of @xmath105 m@xmath16 ( figure  [ fig : masses ] ) .",
    "the ssp stellar population ages span about 10 to 570 myr , with a median value of @xmath106 myr .      in the redshift range relevant for short grbs ( @xmath107 ) roughly an equal fraction of the cosmic stellar mass budget resides in early- and late - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "if short grbs track stellar mass alone we expect a roughly one - to - one ratio of galaxy types .",
    "this does not appear to be the case .",
    "for example , within the sample of short grbs with optical afterglows ( 20 events ) , only 2 are unambiguously hosted by early - type galaxies ( grbs 050724 and 100117 ; @xcite , fong et al . in prep . ) , while 8 are unambiguously hosted by late - type galaxies ; the probability of obtaining this ratio from an intrinsic one - to - one distribution is only 0.04 .",
    "the identity of the remaining 9 hosts is unclear at the present due to their faintness or the lack of underlying galaxies at the burst positions .",
    "still , unless nearly all of these bursts were hosted by early - type galaxies , the resulting ratio appears to be skewed in favor of late - type host galaxies with on - going star formation activity .",
    "the same result holds true even when considering the bursts with only x - ray afterglow positions and identified hosts .",
    "thus , the host galaxy demographics suggest that short grbs do not track stellar mass alone , or phrased alternatively , they do not have a delay time distribution that is skewed to old ages of @xmath108 gyr .",
    "it is possible , however , that this result is influenced by secondary factors such as the typical circumburst density or intrinsic differences in the energy scale and afterglow brightness as a function of galaxy type ( possibly reminiscent of the differences in peak luminosity for type ia supernovae in early- and late - type galaxies ; @xcite ) .",
    "if such differences lead to fainter afterglows ( or prompt emission ) for short grbs in early - type galaxies , this would suppress the early - type fraction .",
    "although the modest size of the host sample , and the substantial fraction of short grbs with only @xmath1-ray positions ( @xmath109 of all events ) , prevent definitive conclusions , it does not appear that the optical afterglows of short grbs in early- and late - type galaxies are distinct @xcite ; see  [ sec : kicks ] .",
    "i next turn to a comparison of the inferred stellar masses with the galaxy mass function @xcite .",
    "the cumulative distribution of stellar masses for the short grb hosts is shown in figure  [ fig : masses_2 ] with the range of possible masses bounded by the single age ssp and maximal values .",
    "i also present a breakdown of the sample into early- and late - type galaxies , each spanning the same range . for the late - type hosts ,",
    "the intermediate young+old values are also shown . to compare these distributions to the distribution of galaxy masses",
    "i also plot the cumulative stellar mass function _ weighted by mass _ , i.e. , the fraction of stellar mass in galaxies above some mass , @xmath110 , given by the equation : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the schechter mass function : @xmath113    , calculated from several published galaxy stellar mass functions at @xmath114 ( cyan and magenta lines ; @xcite ) ; for the @xcite mass function the @xmath115 bin is used , appropriate for the short grb sample , and separately plot the mass function for quiescent galaxies and for intermediate - activity galaxies , which resemble the intermediate star formation activity in short grb hosts @xcite .",
    "the comparison indicates that short grbs trace galaxy mass _ only _ if the bulk of the late - type hosts have close to maximal masses .",
    "the subset of early - type hosts appears to faithfully trace the mass function of galaxies for the ssp - derived masses . from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : masses_2],width=355 ]    several determinations of @xmath112 are used for this comparison , including the @xcite mass function from the 2mass/2df catalogs for all galaxy types at @xmath116 ( @xmath117 m@xmath16 , @xmath118 ) ; the nearly identical @xcite mass function from sdss for all galaxy types at @xmath116 ( @xmath119 m@xmath16 , @xmath120 ) ; the @xcite mass function for late - type galaxies from 2mass / sdss converted to a salpeter imf for comparison with our inferred values ( @xmath121 m@xmath16 , @xmath122 ) ; and the @xcite mass functions from the cosmos survey for quiescent galaxies at @xmath123 ( @xmath124 m@xmath16 , @xmath125 ) and intermediate - activity galaxies at @xmath115 ( @xmath126 m@xmath16 , @xmath127 ) , matched to the redshifts of the early- and late - type short grb host galaxies in our sample .",
    "the resulting distributions of @xmath110 for the various mass functions are shown in figure  [ fig : masses_2 ] .",
    "the agreement ( or lack thereof ) between the short grb hosts and the galaxy mass functions is assessed using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test . for the full sample",
    "there is negligible probability that the distribution of single age ssp masses is drawn from the galaxy mass function , with @xmath128 . on the other hand , for the maximal mass distribution",
    "the probability is @xmath129 indicating that for these masses the short grb sample is fully consistent with the galaxy mass function . using the intermediate case of ssp masses for the early - type hosts and the young+old masses for the late - type hosts ,",
    "the probability is @xmath130 , indicating that this combination is also consistent with the galaxy mass function .    separating the early - type hosts , their ssp masses are consistent with the @xcite mass function of quiescent galaxies ( @xmath131 ) ;",
    "their large maximal masses , on the other hand , are inconsistent with the mass function , with @xmath132 .",
    "finally , for the late - type hosts there is a clear inconsistency of the single age ssp masses with the @xcite mass function of intermediate - activity galaxies , with @xmath133 .",
    "however , the maximal mass distribution is consistent with the mass function ( @xmath130 ) , while the young+old mass distribution is marginally consistent ( @xmath134 ) .    to summarize , the distribution of short grb host masses is compatible with the overall mass distribution of galaxies only if their stellar masses are given by the ssp masses for the early - type hosts and the maximal or young+old masses for the late - type hosts .",
    "since the opposite scenario ( maximal masses for the early - type hosts and ssp masses for the late - type hosts ) is unlikely , the existing sample of short grb hosts is consistent with the galaxy mass function @xcite .",
    "equivalently , this means that short grbs may indeed track stellar mass alone .",
    "however , i caution that the host demographics seem to be at odds with the expected equal fractions of total stellar mass in early- and late - type galaxies , unless nearly all of the unidentified hosts are early - type galaxies",
    ". this , along with the somewhat lower than expected masses of the late - type hosts , leaves open the possibility that at least a subset of short grb progenitors track star formation activity rather than stellar mass .      despite the possibility that some short grb progenitors may track star formation activity , the inferred stellar masses and population ages of short grb hosts are generally distinct from those of long grb hosts in both the single age ssp and maximal models @xcite .",
    "most importantly , this is true for the subset of late - type hosts . in the framework of the single age ssp model",
    "the k - s probability is only @xmath135 that the long and short grb hosts are drawn from the same mass distribution .",
    "the probability is higher for the subset of late - type short grb hosts , @xmath134 ( figure  [ fig : masses ] ) .",
    "however , since the ssp values represent the mass of only the young stellar populations , they are mostly reflective of the star formation activity rather than the total stellar mass .",
    "using instead the maximal masses , the k - s probability that the long grb hosts and late - type hosts of short grbs are drawn from the same sample is negligible , @xmath136 ( figure  [ fig : masses ] ) , demonstrating that they are distinct galaxy populations .",
    "a similar conclusion is apparent from a comparison of the single age ssp population ages .",
    "the k - s probability that the long grb hosts and late - type hosts of short grbs are drawn from the same distribution is only @xmath137 .",
    "thus , the long grb hosts have significantly lower stellar masses than the subset of late - type short grb hosts , and their young stellar population are significantly younger .",
    "indeed , a comparison of the long grb host maximal masses to the @xcite mass function of high - activity galaxies at @xmath138 ( appropriate for the long grb sample considered here ) indicates a k - s probability of only @xmath139 that the long grb hosts are drawn from the galaxy mass function .",
    "this is consistent with our understanding that their massive star progenitors select galaxies by star formation ( and perhaps additional factors such as metallicity ) , but not by stellar mass .",
    "the apparent distinction between long grb hosts and the late - type hosts of short grbs in terms of their stellar masses and young population ages strengthens the conclusion in  [ sec : hosts ] based on the star formation rates , specific star formation rates , luminosities , and metallicities @xcite . in essentially",
    "every property the late - type short grb hosts point to a population of more quiescent , massive , and evolved galaxies than the hosts of long grbs .",
    "i therefore conclude that this rules out the idea that short grb progenitors in late - type hosts are massive stars identical to long grb progenitors @xcite , _ even if the short grbs in late - type galaxies indeed track star formation rather than stellar mass .",
    "_      a determination of the delay function from the derived stellar population ages is complicated by two primary factors .",
    "first , they rely on the assumption that the short grb progenitors in each host were formed within the inferred stellar population .",
    "this assumption is justified statistically both for an association of the progenitors with stellar mass and with star formation activity , as long as we can appropriately normalize the rates of short grbs .",
    "second , while it is possible to determine single age ssp ages from the broad - band photometry , these data are not sufficient to provide an age breakdown ( by mass ) for multiple stellar components .",
    "indeed , for the hybrid young+old model , the age of the old population has to be fixed ( to the age of the universe in the analysis of @xcite ) .",
    "still , in the young+old model , the bulk of the mass ( @xmath140 ) is contained in the old stellar population , and so the progenitors would have `` old '' ages ( @xmath141 ) if they tracked stellar mass .    as a result of these limitations",
    "it is only possible to explore the implications of two main scenarios , namely that short grbs track mass and/or star formation activity . in the context of the former scenario",
    "i have shown in  [ sec : mass ] that the short grbs in early - type hosts trace stellar mass .",
    "therefore , their ssp ages can be used to provide a rough estimate of the progenitor ages , @xmath142 gyr , with a median of about 3 gyr . on the other hand , for the late - type hosts ( for which no credible information on the mass - weighted stellar population age can be extracted ) ,",
    "it is possible to infer a typical delay relative to the most recent star formation episode under the assumption that these progenitors track star formation activity .",
    "i find ssp ages of @xmath143 gyr , with a median of about 0.25 gyr , or young+old ages of about @xmath144 gyr with a median of about 0.1 gyr .",
    "thus , if short grbs follow both stellar mass ( in early - type galaxies ) and star formation activity ( in late - type galaxies ) , the typical delay times are about 3 and 0.2 gyr , respectively .",
    "i next turn from a galactic - scale investigation of short grb host environments to the sub - galactic scale . in general , the sub - galactic environments of cosmic explosions provide powerful insight into the nature of their progenitors . for example , in the case of long grbs , the distribution of projected physical and host - normalized offsets relative to the host centers matched the expected distribution for massive stars in an exponential disk @xcite .",
    "moreover , long grbs are spatially correlated with the brightest uv regions of their hosts @xcite . both of these studies have relied on high angular resolution _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations to spatially resolve the hosts and astrometrically locate the grb positions to pixel - scale accuracy . as a by - product",

    "individual offsets have been measured for several short grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a study relying on ground based data without a complete astrometric treatment was published by @xcite . however ,",
    "the first systematic study of short grb offsets , as well as their galactic environments and host morphologies was recently published by @xcite .",
    "the sample includes ten short grbs ( spanning may 2005 to december 2006 ) , of which seven have been localized to sub - arcsecond precision , and of those , six are robustly associated with host galaxies ( for details see @xcite ) .",

    "these quantities are crucial for a comparison of the morphologies and sizes to those of long grbs , as well as for normalization of the projected offsets relative to the galaxy size .",
    "three hosts ( grbs 050709 , 051221a , and 061006 ) are best modeled with @xmath146 , corresponding to an exponential disk profile , while two hosts ( grbs 050509b and 050724 ) are best modeled with @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively , typical of elliptical galaxies .",
    "these classifications are in perfect agreement with their spectroscopic properties .",
    "the final three hosts in the sample ( grbs 051210 , 060121 , and 060313 ) are faint , and as a results can be modeled with a wide range of @xmath145 values , although @xmath149 is preferred in all three cases",

    "a similar fraction was determined independently from spectroscopic observations (  [ sec : hosts ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "the morphological analysis also yields values of the galaxy effective radii , @xmath150 .",
    "a range of @xmath151 is found , corresponding to physical scales of about @xmath152 kpc .",

    "first , all long grb hosts have @xmath154 , and the median value for the population is @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "thus , they are all morphologically classified as exponential disk galaxies , while 2 of the 8 short grb hosts exhibit de vaucouleurs elliptical galaxy profiles . however , for the short grb hosts with @xmath156 , the distribution of @xmath145 values appears to be similar to that of long grb hosts @xcite .",
    "second , the short grb host galaxies have larger effective radii , with @xmath157 kpc , compared to @xmath158 kpc for long grb hosts @xcite . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates that the probability that the short and long grb hosts are drawn from the same underlying distribution of host galaxy effective radii is only 0.04",
    ". thus , short grb host galaxies are systematically larger than long grb hosts .",
    "the larger sizes are expected in the context of the well - known galaxy size - luminosity relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the higher luminosity of short grb hosts (  [ sec : hosts ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "values ( figure  [ fig : sball ] ) . also shown are the data for long grb hosts based on _ hst _ observations from the sample of @xcite . the hosts of short grbs 050509b and 050724 have @xmath145 values typical of elliptical galaxies , but the remaining hosts have a similar distribution to that of long grbs ( i.e. , a median of @xmath149 , or an exponential disk profile ) .",
    "on the other hand , the hosts of short grbs are larger by about a factor of 2 than the hosts of long grbs , in agreement with their higher luminosities . from @xcite.,width=336 ]    an additional striking difference between the hosts of long and short grbs is the apparent dearth of interacting or irregular galaxies in the short grb sample .",
    "of the eight short grb host galaxies with _ hst _ observations only one exhibits an irregular morphology ( grb050709 ) and none appear to be undergoing mergers .",
    "in contrast , the fraction of long grb hosts with an irregular or merger / interaction morphology is @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "the interpretation for the high merger / interaction fraction in the long grb sample is that such galaxies represent sites of intense star formation activity triggered by the merger / interaction process , and are therefore suitable for the production of massive stars @xcite .",

    "these bursts have accurate positions from optical afterglow detections . in the case of grbs 070724 and 071227",
    "the optical afterglows coincide with the disks of edge - on spiral galaxies ( figure  [ fig:070724 ] ; @xcite ) .",

    "there are 7 additional events with optical afterglow identifications . of these ,",
    "two bursts ( 070707 and 070714b ) coincide with galaxies @xcite , but their offsets have not been reported by the authors . based on the claimed coincidence a conservative estimate is @xmath171 , corresponding to @xmath172 kpc . for grb090426 an offset relative to one of the knots in the host galaxy complex was reported @xcite , but not relative to the host center .",
    "finally , four bursts ( 070809 , 080503 , 090305 , 090515 ) do not have coincident host galaxies to deep limits ; these bursts are discussed in detail in  [ sec : kicks ] .",
    "in addition to the bursts with sub - arcsecond positions , several hosts have been identified within xrt error circles in follow - up observations ( grbs 060801 , 061210 , 061217 , 070429b , 070729 , and 080123 ; @xcite ) .",

    "also shown is the differential probability distribution , @xmath178 , taking into account the non - gaussian errors on the radial offsets ( see discussion in appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "the median for this sample is about 5 kpc @xcite .    as evident from the preceding discussion ,",
    "this is not a complete offset distribution ; roughly an equal number of short grbs have only limits or undetermined offsets due to their detection in just the x - rays or @xmath1-rays . taking these events into account ,",
    "our most robust inferences about the offset distribution of short grbs are as follows :    * at least @xmath179 of all short grbs have projected physical offsets of @xmath180 kpc . *",
    "at least @xmath181 of all short grbs have projected physical offsets of @xmath182 kpc .",
    "* at least @xmath42 of all short grbs have projected physical offsets of @xmath183 kpc ; this value includes the upper limits for the hosts identified within xrt error circles .",
    "these robust constraints are marked in figure  [ fig : offset ] .",
    "i next compare the short grb offset distribution with the offsets of long grbs from the sample of @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : offset ] .",
    "the offset distribution of long grbs has been used to argue for a massive star progenitor population , and against ns - ns binaries @xcite .",
    "the offset distribution of short grbs is clearly shifted to larger physical scales . in particular , the median offset for the long grbs is 1.1 kpc , about a factor of 5 times smaller than the median value for short grbs .",
    "similarly , no long grb offsets are larger than about 7 kpc , whereas at least some short grbs appear to have offsets in excess of 15 kpc .",
    "the significant difference between the offset distributions indicates that short grbs do not arise from the same progenitor population as long grbs .",
    "i further compare the observed distribution ( and the robust constraints outlined above ) with predicted distributions for ns - ns binaries in milky way type galaxies @xcite , appropriate for the observed luminosities of short grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is good agreement between the observed distribution and those predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the offset distribution of @xcite , with a median of about 7 kpc , predicts larger offsets and therefore provides a poorer fit to the observed distribution , which has a median of about 5 kpc .",
    "however , all three predicted distributions accommodate the offset constraints . in particular",
    ", they predict about @xmath184 of the offsets to be @xmath180 kpc , about @xmath185 to be @xmath183 kpc , and about @xmath186 of the offsets to be @xmath182 kpc .",
    "thus , the projected physical offsets of short grbs are consistent with population synthesis predictions for ns - ns binaries .",
    "however , the observations are also consistent with partial contribution from other progenitor systems for which kicks are not expected ( magnetars , wd - wd binaries , accreting ns ) .",
    "in addition to the offset analysis in the previous section , @xcite studied the local environments of short grbs using a comparison of the host brightness at the grb location to the overall host light distribution .",
    "this approach is advantageous because it is independent of galaxy morphology , and does not suffer from ambiguity in the definition of the host center ( see @xcite ) .",
    "i note that for the regular morphologies of most short grb hosts (  [ sec : morph ] ) , the definition of the host center is generally robust , unlike in the case of long grbs @xcite . on the other hand , this approach has the downside that it requires precise pixel - scale positional accuracy . in the existing sample , this is only available for 6 short bursts .",
    "the fraction of total host light in pixels fainter than the afterglow pixel brightness for each host / filter combination is given in @xcite .",
    "the cumulative light distribution histogram is shown in figure  [ fig : light ] .",
    "the shaded histogram represents the range defined by the dual filters for 5 of the 6 bursts .",
    "the upper bound of the distribution is defined by the blue filters , indicating that short grbs trace the rest - frame optical light of their hosts better than the rest - frame uv .",
    "this indicates that short grb progenitors are likely to be associated with a relatively old stellar population , rather than a young and uv bright population .",
    "the overall distribution has a median value of @xmath187 ( blue vs.  red filters ) ; namely , only in about one - quarter of the cases , @xmath42 of the host light is in pixels fainter than at the grb location .",
    "thus , the overall distribution of short grb locations under - represents the host galaxies light distribution , but traces the red light ( old stars ) more closely than the blue light ( star formation ) .",
    "this is also true in comparison to the distribution for core - collapse sne , which appear to track their host light @xcite , and even type ia sne , which have a median of about 0.4 @xcite .",
    "thus , the progenitors of short grbs appear to be more diffusely distributed than type ia sn progenitors .    an extensive analysis of the brightness distribution at the location of long grbs has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "these authors find that long grbs are more concentrated on the brightest regions of their hosts than expected from the light distribution of each host .",
    "in particular , they conclude that the probability distribution of long grb positions is roughly proportional to the surface brightness squared .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : light ] , short grbs have a significantly more diffuse distribution relative to the host light than long grbs .",
    "in particular , for the latter , the median light fraction is about 0.85 compared to about @xmath188 for the short grbs .",
    "one of the predictions of the compact object coalescence model is that some binaries could merge at large separations from their host galaxies due to a combination of large kick velocities and a long merger timescale @xcite . with kicks of several hundred km s@xmath17 and merger timescales of @xmath189 ,",
    "such a binary could travel several hundred kpc from its host , corresponding to @xmath190 at @xmath36 and @xmath191 at @xmath72 .",
    "such large offsets would not be expected in other progenitor scenarios .",
    "it is important to note , however , that if the typical kick velocities are @xmath192 km s@xmath17 , an ns - ns / ns - bh system is likely to remain bound to its host regardless of the merger timescale , and hence to reside at offsets of @xmath193tens of kpc ( as already inferred for some short grbs @xcite ; figure  [ fig : offset ] ) .",
    "similarly , short merger timescales ( tens to hundreds of myr ) would also lead to relatively small offsets regardlss of the kick velocity .",
    "clearly , an observational demonstration of a large offset is not trivial .",
    "ideally , we would like to measure the redshift of the burst directly through afterglow spectroscopy and then associate it with a galaxy at a large separation .",
    "however , to date , short grb redshifts have been measured through their host associations so this test is not possible .    at a more tentative level",
    ", we can also investigate the large - scale environments around short grbs that do not appear to spatially coincide with bright galaxy counterparts to assess the potential for a host with large offset .",
    "this is a particularly important test if combined with the afterglow properties of short grbs with and without coincident hosts . in the current sample",
    ", there are 5 cases of short grbs with sub - arcsecond positions and no obvious bright hosts .",
    "below , i assess the possibility of large offsets for these bursts , and compare this with alternative explanations ( e.g. , a high redshift origin ) .",
    "the sample includes 20 short grbs with optical afterglows .",
    "images of the fields around the 5 bursts with no coincident hosts are shown in figure  [ fig : nohost ] ; hereafter , i denote these 5 bursts as _ sample 2 _ , with the remaining 15 bursts with coincident hosts designated as _",
    "sample 1_. the afterglow positions , as well as nearby galaxies with varying probabilities of chance coincidence are marked in figure  [ fig : nohost ] .",
    "the limits at the positions of the afterglows range from @xmath194 to @xmath195 mag @xcite .     and @xmath196 .",
    "the right panel shows the projected histogram for the bursts with detected afterglows ( hatched ) and upper limits ( open ) .",
    "the symbols mark the mean for each sample , and the vertical bar marks the standard deviation for _ sample 1_. from @xcite.,width=336 ]    in terms of the afterglow properties , the bursts in _ sample 2 _ have a median optical brightness that is 1.4 mag fainter than the bursts in _ sample 1 _ ( figure  [ fig : optag ] , and x - ray fluxes at 8 hours that are about a factor of 2 times smaller .",
    "their @xmath1-ray fluences are similarly smaller , by about a factor of 5 @xcite .",
    "the differences in optical afterglow brightness can be due to lower densities or higher redshifts for _ sample 2_. both of these scenarios would also explain the lack of bright coincident hosts , since low densities may be indicative of large offsets and high redshifts will lead to fainter host galaxies .",
    "the difference in x - ray brightness does not significantly constrain these two possibilities , while the fainter @xmath1-ray emission of the bursts in _ sample 2 _ points to high redshift as the likely explanation , since in the context of the standard grb model the prompt emission fluence does not depend on the circumburst density .",
    "i next turn to an analysis of the large - scale environments of the bursts in _ sample 2 _ , particularly in comparison to the hosts of bursts in _",

    "since no _ a priori _ model - independent knowledge is available for the range of possible kicks and merger timescales , it is not possible to rule out galaxies at very large offsets for which @xmath213 .",
    "indeed , a reasonable constraint of @xmath214 km s@xmath17 and @xmath215 gyr leads to only a weak constraint on the offset of @xmath180 mpc . at @xmath30 ( @xmath216 )",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath217 ( @xmath218 ) , a projected distance at which nearly all galaxies will have a chance coincidence probability of order unity .",
    "however , this fact only means that we can not rule out offsets that are even _ larger _ than inferred from the most likely host association .",
    "a second difficulty is that i am using angular offsets , which ignore the potential wide range of redshifts ( and by extension also luminosities ) of the various galaxies .",
    "for example , if the faint galaxies with small offsets are located at @xmath37 , the corresponding physical offsets are @xmath219 kpc , while if the galaxies at @xmath220 offsets are located at @xmath123 , the offsets are only somewhat larger , @xmath173 kpc .",
    "a galaxy at an even lower redshift , @xmath72 , with an offset of 50 kpc will be located about @xmath221 from the grb position and incur a large penalty in terms of chance coincidence probability .",
    "it is important to note , however , that galaxies at lower redshift will generally have brighter apparent magnitudes , partially compensating for the larger angular separations ( equations  [ eqn : gal ] and [ eqn : prob ] ) . in only a single case ( grb070809 )",

    "thus , i conclude that the most conservative estimate of the ratio of star forming to elliptical hosts is about 1:1 , but that if the well - studied ( i.e. , brighter ) hosts are representative of the whole sample , than the ratio is about 4:1",
    ". a ratio of about 1:1 is expected if short grbs select galaxies by stellar mass alone .",
    "thus , the existing demographics can not rule out this scenario , but do appear to point to an over - abundance of short grbs in late - type galaxies , possibly indicative of a short grb rate that partially depends on star formation activity .",
    "although star forming hosts appear to dominate the host population , it is clear from a comparison of their luminosities , metallicities , stellar masses , population ages , sizes , and star formation rates that they are distinct from the hosts of long grbs .",
    "namely , they exhibit lower star formation activity and appear to be larger , more massive , and dominated by more evolved stellar populations .",
    "this indicates that the short grb progenitors are mostly related to the old stellar populations within their hosts , and perhaps only partially to the modest level of on - going star formation activity .",
    "this is further supported by the dearth of morphological galaxy merger signatures , which point to delays of @xmath18 gyr relative to any merger - triggered star formation episodes .",
    "these conclusions are in direct contrast to the massive star progenitors of long grbs , which select galaxies by star formation ( and perhaps metallicity ) .",
    "while the relation to old stellar populations does not rule out models such as wd - wd mergers or wd / ns aic , it does disfavor young magnetars .",
    "as an aside , i note that this result demonstrates that caution should be taken with the proposed re - classification of short and long grbs into type i and ii events , marking old and young progenitors , respectively @xcite .",
    "such a new bimodal classification may lead to the erroneous conclusion that short grbs in late - type galaxies ( even if they track the on - going star formation activity ) share the same progenitors as long grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) since both would be classified as type ii . at the very least",
    ", such a new classification scheme may require a further breakdown of the type ii events into those that result from massive stars versus those that simply track star formation activity with a modest delay , e.g. , type iia and iib .",

    "i note that this is only a rough estimate since the calculation is appropriate for @xmath116 , while the host redshift distribution extends at least to @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , a comparison of the observed redshift distribution ( with a range of @xmath284 and a median of @xmath285 ) to the models of @xcite ( their figure 2 ) , indicates a typical progenitor merger timescale of about 3 gyr ( for a log - normal merger timescale distribution ) .",
    "a comparison to the models of @xcite ( their figure 4 ) , indicates a value of @xmath286 ( for a power law merger timescale distribution ) , in good agreement with the results from host demographics .",

    "the differential offsets measured from the _ hst _ observations provide the most precise values to date for short grbs , with a total uncertainty of only @xmath290 mas ( @xmath291 pixel ) , corresponding to @xmath292 pc .",
    "none of the offsets are smaller than @xmath293 kpc , while this is the median offset for long grbs . on the other hand , a substantial fraction of the offsets",
    "are only a few kpc , indicating that at least some short grbs explode within the stellar component of their hosts ( rather than their extended halos ) .",
    "the median offset from the _ hst _ observations supplemented by ground - based data is about 5 kpc ( figure  [ fig : offset ] ) , roughly 5 times larger than for long grbs .",
    "as discussed above , the observed offset distribution is incomplete since about @xmath177 of all short grbs have only @xmath1-ray positions ( @xmath294 ) , and a similar fraction have only xrt positions , which generally lead to a range of @xmath170 kpc .",
    "taking these limitations into account i find that the most robust constraints on the offset distribution are that @xmath295 of all short grbs have offsets of @xmath180 kpc , and that @xmath296 have offsets of @xmath182 kpc .",
    "in addition , for the current sample of of short grbs with sub - arcsecond afterglow positions and no coincident bright hosts , i find evidence for offsets of @xmath297 kpc (  [ sec : kicks ] ) .    both the observed offset distribution and the various constraints are in good agreement with predictions for the offset distribution of ns - ns binaries in milky way type galaxies @xcite",
    ". however , at the present a partial contribution from other progenitor systems , such as delayed magnetar formation and even young magnetar flares , can not be ruled out .",
    "the existence of modest ( @xmath2 kpc ) and perhaps large ( @xmath297 kpc ) offsets in the sample suggests that these latter models are not likely to account for _ all _ short grbs .    in the context of implications for the progenitor population ,",
    "the study of short grb physical offsets by @xcite led to the claim that short grbs with extended x - ray emission have systematically smaller offsets than those with only a prompt spike , possibly due to a systematic difference in the progenitors .",
    "the _ hst _ sample of @xcite includes three short grbs with significant extended emission ( 050709 , 050724 , and 061006 ) , and one burst ( 060121 ) with possible extended emission ( @xmath298 significance ; @xcite ) .",
    "the physical offsets of these bursts are about 3.7 , 2.7 , 1.3 , and 1 kpc , respectively , leading to a mean offset of about 2.2 kpc .",
    "the physical offsets of the bursts without extended emission , but with precise afterglow positions ( 051221 , 060313 , and 061201 ) are 2.0 , 2.3 , and 14.2 or 32.5 kpc , respectively .",
    "the two events with no extended emission and with xrt positions ( 050509b and 051210 ) have offsets of about @xmath299 and @xmath300 kpc , respectively . including the ground - based sample with optical afterglow positions , the bursts with apparent extended emission ( 070714b , 071227 , 080513 , and 090510 ; @xcite ) have offsets of @xmath172 , 14.8 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 kpc , while the bursts without extended emission ( 070724 and 070809 ) have offsets of 4.8 and @xmath303 kpc .",
    "thus , in the sample of events with sub - arcsecond positions , 6/8 bursts with extended emission have offsets of @xmath304 kpc and 2/8 have likely offsets of @xmath305 kpc . in the sample without extended emission ,",
    "4/5 have offsets of @xmath306 kpc and 1/5 has a likely offset of @xmath307 kpc .",
    "thus , at the present it does not appear that there is a significant difference in the two offset distributions .",
    "the inclusion of events with only xrt positions does not alter this conclusion .",
    "in particular , of the subset with no extended emission only grb050509b is likely to have a significant offset , while grbs 051210 , 060801 , and 070429b have offsets ( @xmath300 , @xmath174 , and @xmath176 kpc , respectively ) that are consistent with zero .",
    "similarly , grb061210 with extended emission has an offset of @xmath308 kpc .",
    "a continued investigation of the difference between short grbs with and without extended emission will greatly benefit from the use of host - normalized offsets , which take into account the individual hosts effective radii .",
    "the sample of short grbs with optical afterglows represents about @xmath309 of all short bursts , and may thus not be fully representative .",
    "one often - discussed bias is that the bursts with optical afterglows require a high circumburst density , and therefore have negligible offsets .",
    "however , from the analysis in  [ sec : kicks ] @xcite it is clear that one explanation for the lack of coincident hosts for the bursts in _ sample 2 _ is indeed large offsets , _ despite their detection in the optical band_.    as shown in figure  [ fig : offset2 ] , the ns - ns merger model predictions have a median of about 6 kpc , compared to about 4 kpc for the observed sample . on the other hand ,",
    "the models predict @xmath310 of offsets to be @xmath311 kpc , in good agreement with the observed distribution in both the @xmath219 kpc and @xmath312 kpc scenarios (  [ sec : kicks ] ) .",
    "i note that the overall smaller offsets measured from the data may be due to projections effects . indeed ,",
    "the mean correction factor of @xmath226 nicely reconciles the theoretical and observed distributions .    in  [ sec : kicks ] i noted a bimodality in the physical and host - normalized offsets for _ sample 1 _ and _ sample 2 _ ( figure  [ fig : offset1 ] ) . in the framework of ns - ns binary kicks",
    "this bimodality may indicate that the binaries generally remain bound to their host galaxies , thereby spending most of their time at the maximal distance defined by @xmath313 ( i.e. , with their kinetic energy stored as potential energy ; @xcite ) .",
    "this would require typical kick velocities of less than a few hundred km s@xmath17 .",
    "i further compare the observed offset distribution to predictions for dynamically formed ns - ns binaries in globular clusters , with a range of host galaxy virial masses of @xmath314 m@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these models predict a range of only @xmath315 of all ns - ns mergers to occur within 10 kpc of the host center , in contrast to the observed distribution with about @xmath316 with @xmath317 kpc .",
    "i stress that this result is independent of what offsets are assigned to the bursts in _ sample 2 _ since they account for only 1/4 of the bursts with optical afterglows .",
    "on the other hand , the globular cluster origin may account for the bimodality in the physical and host - normalized offsets ( figure  [ fig : offset1 ] ) , with the objects in _ sample 2 _ arising in globular clusters and the objects with coincident hosts arising from primordial ns - ns binaries .",
    "this possibility also agrees with the predicted fraction of dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries of @xmath318 @xcite .",
    "the cumulative offset distributions for _ sample 2 _ alone ( assuming the hosts are the galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence ) is well - matched by the range of predictions for dynamically - formed ns - ns binaries in globular clusters ( figure  [ fig : offset2 ] ) . in this scenario , however , the implication is that short grbs outside of globular clusters do not experience kicks as expected for ns - ns binaries since the largest measured offset is only 15 kpc .    unless the populations of short grbs with only x - ray or @xmath1-ray positions have fundamentally different offset distributions , i conclude that the measured offsets of short grbs and the predicted offsets for ns - ns kicks are in good agreement , _ if when treating all short grbs with optical afterglows as a single population_. alternatively , it is possible that the bimodal distributions of physical and host - normalized offsets point to a progenitor bimodality , with the bursts in _ sample 2 _ originating in globular clusters .",
    "in addition to the projected offsets relative to their host centers , it is apparent that short grbs are more diffusely distributed relative to their host light than long grbs . in particular",
    ", the locations of short grbs under - represent their overall host light distributions , even in comparison to core - collapse and type ia sne . on the other hand",
    ", it appears from the current small sample that short grbs are better tracers of their hosts rest - frame optical light than uv light .",
    "this result indicates that short grbs arise in locations within their hosts that trace the distribution of older stellar populations , and clearly do not trace the sites of active star formation .",
    "this result provides strong support to the claim that although most short grb hosts are star forming galaxies , the bursts themselves are not related to the star formation activity (  [ sec : hosts ] ) .    at the present , the sample of events with sufficiently precise astrometry to determine the burst locations at the level of @xmath319 _ hst _ pixel is very small ( 6 events ) .",
    "it is therefore not possible to draw conclusions about the fraction of short grbs that are associated with old stellar populations as opposed to young populations ( as expected for young magnetars ) .",
    "luckily , there are at least 10 additional events for which these measurements can be made with future _ hst _ observations . at the present , i conclude that the stronger correlation of short grbs with the rest - frame optical light than uv light of their hosts is indicative of a dominant old progenitor population .",
    "while the sample of short grbs with afterglow positions is still significantly smaller than that of long grbs , we have made significant progress in understanding their galactic and sub - galactic environments .",
    "the results of host galaxy imaging and spectroscopy , including high - resolution imaging with _ hst _ , point to an association of short grbs with old stellar populations within a range of normal star forming and elliptical galaxies . in nearly every respect ( star formation rates , metallicities , sizes , offsets , light distribution ) the environments of short grbs are distinct from those of long grbs , indicating that their progenitors are not related to a young progenitor population .    as i showed through the study of short grb offsets , host galaxy demographics , and the redshift distribution ,",
    "the current observations are fully consistent with ns - ns / ns - bh binary mergers .",
    "however , a partial contribution from other ( mainly old ) progenitor channels ( e.g. , wd - wd mergers leading to magnetar formation , wd / ns aic ) can not be ruled out at the present .",
    "currently , we do not have conclusive evidence for significant progenitor kicks , which are only expected in the coalescence model .",
    "still , a few events with sub - arcsecond optical positions do not directly coincide with bright host galaxies , and yet reside within tens of kpc from bright , low - redshift galaxies .",
    "this may be suggestive of progenitor kicks , but it is also possible that these bursts are associated with fainter hosts ( likely at higher redshift ) with marginal offsets .    with continued vigilance , and a short grb discovery rate of about 1 event per month ,",
    "we are likely to gain further insight into the nature of short grb progenitors in the next few years , possibly with the first detections ( or significant limits ) of gravitational waves .",
    "as argued in this review , host galaxy observations of existing and future events will play a central role in our on - going quest to determine the identity of short grb progenitors .",

    "<S> the study of short - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) experienced a complete revolution in recent years thanks to the discovery of the first afterglows and host galaxies starting in may 2005 . </S>",
    "<S> these observations demonstrated that short grbs are cosmological in origin , reside in both star forming and elliptical galaxies , are not associated with supernovae , and span a wide isotropic - equivalent energy range of @xmath0 erg . </S>",
    "<S> however , a fundamental question remains unanswered : what are the progenitors of short grbs ? the most popular theoretical model invokes the coalescence of compact object binaries with neutron star and/or black hole constituents . </S>",
    "<S> however , additional possibilities exist , including magnetars formed through prompt channels ( massive star core - collapse ) and delayed channels ( binary white dwarf mergers , white dwarf accretion - induced collapse ) , or accretion - induced collapse of neutron stars . in this review </S>",
    "<S> i summarize our current knowledge of the galactic and sub - galactic environments of short grbs , and use these observations to draw inferences about the progenitor population . </S>",
    "<S> the most crucial results are : ( i ) some short grbs explode in dead elliptical galaxies ; ( ii ) the majority of short grbs occur in star forming galaxies ; ( iii ) the star forming hosts of short grbs are distinct from those of long grbs , and instead appear to be drawn from the general field galaxy population ; ( iv ) the physical offsets of short grbs relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long grbs ; ( v ) there is tentative evidence for large offsets from short grbs with optical afterglows and no coincident hosts ; ( vi ) the observed offset distribution is in good agreement with predictions for ns - ns binary mergers ; and ( vii ) short grbs trace under - luminous locations within their hosts , but appear to be more closely correlated with the rest - frame optical light ( old stars ) than the uv light ( young massive stars ) . taken together , these observations suggest that short grb progenitors belong to an old stellar population with a wide age distribution , and generally track stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> these results are fully consistent with ns - ns binary mergers and rule out a dominant population of prompt magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> however , a partial contribution from delayed magnetar formation or accretion - induced collapse is also consistent with the data .    </S>",
