    "the non - relativistic quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite is extensively used in the various fields of the theoretical physics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "another useful solvable problem of the non - relativistic quantum mechanics is the singular harmonic oscillator @xcite-@xcite due to its application for explanation many fenomena , such as description of spin chains @xcite , quantum hall effect @xcite , fractional statistics and anyons @xcite .",
    "recently , we constructed a relativistic model of the quantum linear singular oscillator @xcite , which can be applied for studying relativistic physical systems as well as systems on a lattice . in the present paper",
    "we generalize this model to the three - dimensional case .",
    "our three - dimensional model is formulated in the framework of the finite - difference relativistic quantum mechanics , which was developed in several papers and applied to the solution of a lot of problems in particle physics @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we briefly discuss the finite - difference relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "we propose a relativistic finite - difference model of the isotropic three - dimensional singular oscillator and find the explicit form of its wavefunctions and energy spectrum in section 3 . in section 4 , we investigate the non - relativistic limits of these wavefunctions and energy spectrum .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the finite - difference relativistic quantum mechanics is closely analogous to the non - relativistic quantum mechanics , but its essential characteristic is that the relative motion wavefunction satisfies a finite - difference equation with a step equal to the compton wavelength of the particle , @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in the case of a local quasipotential of interaction @xmath2 the equation for the wavefunction of two scalar particles with equal mass has the form    @xmath3 \\psi ( \\vec r)=e\\psi ( \\vec r ) \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where the finite - difference operator @xmath4 is a relativistic free hamiltonian    @xmath5   \\ ; , \\ ] ]    and @xmath6 is the square of the angular momentum operator and @xmath7 .",
    "the technique of difference differentiation was developed and analogues of the important functions of the continuous analysis were obtained to fit the relativistic quantum mechanics , based on eq .",

    "the space of vectors @xmath0 is called the relativistic configurational space or @xmath0-space .",
    "the concept of @xmath0-space has been introduced for the first time in the context of the quasipotential approach to the relativistic two - body problem @xcite .",
    "the quasipotential equations for the relativistic scattering amplitude and the wave function @xmath8 in the momentum space have the form @xcite    @xmath9    where    @xmath10    and @xmath11 is the quasipotential .",
    "the integration in ( [ 5a ] ) and ( [ 6a ] ) is carried out over the mass shell of the particle with mass @xmath12 , i.e. over the upper sheet of the hyperboloid @xmath13 , which from the geometrical point of view realizes the three - dimensional lobachevsky space .",
    "the group of motions of this space is the lorentz group @xmath14 .",
    "equations ( [ 5a ] ) and ( [ 6a ] ) have the absolute character with respect to the geometry of the momentum space , i.e. , formally they do nt differ from the non - relativistic lippmann - schwinger and schrdinger equations",
    ". we can derive eqs .",
    "( [ 5a ] ) and ( [ 6a ] ) substituting the relativistic ( non - euclidean ) expressions for the energy , volume element , and @xmath15-function by their non - relativistic ( euclidean ) analogues :    @xmath16    as a consequence of this geometrical treatment , the application of the fourier transformation to the lorentz group becomes natural instead of the usual one . in this case",
    "the relativistic configurational @xmath0-space conseption arises .",
    "transition to relativistic configurational @xmath0-representation    @xmath17    is performed by the use of expansion on the matrix elements of the principal series of the unitary irreducible representations of the lorentz group :    @xmath18    the quantity @xmath19 is relativistic invariant and is connected with the eigenvalues of the casimir operator @xmath20 in the following way :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the rotation and boost generators .",
    "it is easy to verify that the function ( the relativistic plane wave ) ( [ 10a ] ) obeys the finite - difference schrdinger equation    @xmath24    the relativistic plane waves form a complete and orthogonal system of functions in the momentum lobachevsky space .    if we perform the relativistic fourier transformation ( [ 9a ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ 6a ] ) , we arrive at the finite - difference schrdinger equation ( [ 4aa ] ) with the local ( in general case , non - local ) potential in the relativistic @xmath0-space .    in the relativistic @xmath0-space the euclidean geometry",
    "is realized and , in particular , there exists a momentum operator in the relativistic configurational @xmath0 representation @xcite    @xmath25    where a three - dimensional vector @xmath26 has the following components @xcite :",
    "@xmath27    the components of ( [ 13a ] ) and free hamiltonian obey the following commutation relations :    @xmath28 = \\left [ \\hat p_i , h_0\\right ] = 0,\\quad i , j=1,2,3 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the relativistic plane wave is the eigenfunction of the operator @xmath29 :    @xmath30    this means that ( [ 10a ] ) describes the free relativistic motion with definite energy and momentum .    in the non - relativistic limit we come to the usual three - dimensional configurational space and relativistic plane wave ( [ 10a ] ) goes over into the euclidean plane wave , i.e.    @xmath31    note that all the important exactly solvable cases of non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( potential well , coulomb potential , harmonic oscillator etc . ) are also exactly solvable for the case of eq .",
    "( [ 4aa ] ) .",
    "we consider a model of the relativistic three - dimensional singular oscillator , which corresponds to the following interaction quasipotential :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a real quantity .",
    "let us note that in contrast to the case of the coulomb potential @xcite , which can be calculated as an input of the one - photon exchange , the relativistic generalization of the oscillator or singular oscillator potential is not uniquely defined .",
    "therefore , for construction of the quasipotential ( [ eq5 ] ) we proceed from the following requirements for the quasipotential : a ) exact solubility ; b ) the correct non - relativistic limit ; c ) existence of the dynamical symmetry .    in the limiting case",
    "when @xmath34 , @xmath35 goes into the non - relativistic three - dimensional singular harmonic oscillator potential @xcite :    @xmath36    due to spherical symmetry of ( [ eq5 ] ) the angular dependences of the wavefunction @xmath37 ( [ 4aa ] ) are separated in the standard manner    @xmath38    where @xmath39 being the orbital quantum number .",

    "if we normalize the functions ( [ eq16 ] ) as follows    @xmath64    then @xmath65",
    "in the non - relativistic limit , when the parameter @xmath66 we have @xcite    @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "therefore in the limit @xmath34 the radial wavefunctions @xmath69 ( [ eq16 ] ) coincide with the radial wavefunctions of the non - relativistic three - dimensional singular oscillator @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum ( [ eq15 ] ) also has a correct non - relativistic limit , i.e.    @xmath70    in fig .",
    "1 we show the behaviour of the ground state energy level ( [ eq15 ] ) depending on the @xmath33 and @xmath71 for various values of the speed of light @xmath72 . from these plots",
    "we see that decreasing @xmath72 and increasing @xmath71 changes the appearance of the collapse point @xmath73 @xcite .",
