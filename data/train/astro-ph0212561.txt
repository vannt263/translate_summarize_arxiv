    "fransson and kozma ( @xcite ) present the latest values for the amounts of these nuclides where they found the following masses : m(@xmath1ni,@xmath1ni,@xmath7ti)=(0.069,0.003,0.0001)m@xmath8 .",

    "the brightening of the ring was predicted in @xcite .",

    "however , we ca nt estimate the dust temperature and can not measure the dust emission .",
    "if we assume the same bolometric corrections from day 1800 , we find the bolometric flux of sn1987a is @xmath19 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "because there is much less envelope mass above the radioactive energy sources in type ia sne , the bolometric properties of these supernovae are more difficult to interpret because much less of the radioactive energy is thermalized .",
    "the physics of the thermalization is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the radiation which is thermalized must be transported to the surface and radiated away .",
    "if the diffusion time for the energy is short compared to the dynamical time , the energy appears as thermalized `` uvoir '' radiation .",
    "if the diffusion time is long , the trapped radiation will be converted partly into kinetic energy and not seen in the bolometric light curve . with a longer diffusion time , the peak of the bolometric light curve is shifted to later times when the input energy from the radioactive decays is less .",
    "this leads to `` arnett s law '' @xcite which states that the bolometric luminosity at maximum light is equal to the instantaneous energy released by the radioactive decay . this law was ( and is ) an important tool to measure the amount of radioactive nickel produced in the explosion .",
    "continuing the discussion in @xcite , for the first 60 days since explosion the thermalization time is short compared to the dynamical time , and little radioactive energy is converted into kinetic energy . thus the integrated uvoir bolometric luminosity represents the fraction of radioactive energy input which has been thermalized . by day 40 more than one half of gamma - ray radiation is leaving the explosion unthermalized .",
    "even at @xmath20 maximum light some 20 days after explosion , some 15% of the gamma rays are unthermalized .",
    "the observed uvoir bolometric light curve is then a function of the rapidly decreasing optical depth to the gamma - rays over the first 100 days and the decreasing energy input from the radioactive nickel nuclides .",
    "the combination of these two processes accelerates the light curve decay at a rate faster than the radioactive decay of @xmath0co after maximum light .    the uvoir bolometric light curve interpretation is also complicated by the efficiency of the trapping of the gamma rays and positrons in the @xmath0co decay ( @xcite ) .",
    "milne et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that the gamma - rays from the @xmath0co decay carry 30 times more energy than the positrons , but also are more penetrating and can escape more easily . as the nebula expands from days 50 to 200 , the energy deposition switches from the @xmath0co gamma - ray comptonization to the energy input from the positron annihilations . some of the positrons , however , can be transported out of the nebula , depending on the magnetic fields structure .",
    "the bolometric light curve at this phase then becomes dependent on the details of the mixing of the @xmath0co in the nebula and the properties of the magnetic fields .",
    "while the interpretation of the bolometric light curve requires theoretical knowledge of the optical depths to gamma - rays and the details about the mixing of @xmath0ni , the construction of the uvoir bolometric light curve is rather simple due to the following coincidence - - _ most of the thermalized flux appears at optical wavelengths . _ in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] i show the cumulative flux of sn1992a at various phases during the first 100 days of evolution ( @xcite ) . also shown in the figure is a comparison of a type ia sed with that of a type ic and ii ( @xcite ) .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the broad peak of the flux distribution for type ia sne appears in the optical region .",
    "in fact , typically 80% or more of the uvoir flux appears in the optical from day 6 onwards .",
    "only a few papers have been published trying to estimate the bolometric light curves ( see @xcite for a summary ) . in @xcite",
    ", the optical broad - band magnitudes were integrated to provide a magnitude that should be a close surrogate to the uvoir bolometric magnitude . from the estimated bolometric light curve , they found a range of more than a factor in 10 in the @xmath0ni masses for a group of nearby type ia sne . in @xcite ,",
    "a @xmath21 magnitude was used with a bolometric correction to study the gamma - ray trapping in the late - time light curves , which also showed a significant range in @xmath0ni masses .    in 1996 ,",
    "i used the small amount of data on supernovae which had space ultraviolet spectra , optical @xmath22 , and near - infrared @xmath2 data to estimate accurate bolometric fluxes ( @xcite ) .",
    "i found that there was a range in peak bolometric magnitudes ( implying a range in nickel masses ) and that the bolometric light curves appear to have a small secondary hump in the light curve around days 20 - 40 corresponding to the secondary maximum in the @xmath6 band .",

    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the construction of the bolometric light curve requires the sum of the space ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared data .",
    "the falloff of the flux beyond @xmath26 is such that the assumption of a r - j law adds only a few percent to the total flux and a r - j extrapolation from @xmath26 or @xmath27 is entirely adequate .",
    "the extrapolation to the space ultraviolet , however , is larger . using 1992a data",
    ", i found that extrapolating the @xmath28 flux point at 360 nm to zero flux at 300 nm was a reasonable representation of the true space ultraviolet flux from day 6 onwards , yielding agreement to 5% in the uvoir flux between the full integration and the integration using the ultraviolet extrapolation .",
    "it is important to continue to observe nearby sne with @xmath3 in the ultraviolet to understand the diversity of the ultraviolet flux , which may be an indicator of the metallicity of the progenitor .",

    "the absolute flux scale has been set by using either sbf , cepheid , trgb , or pn distances for the nearby sne , or a hubble law of @xmath35 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 for the more distant sne .",

    "the sense of this figure is that most sne have roughly the same peak bolometric luminosity , but the size and placement of the secondary hump is quite variable .",
    "for instance , the peculiar sn2000cx has a rather normal bolometric light curve near maximum light , but almost completely lacks a secondary hump at 30 days .",
    "this bolometric behavior reflects the fact that sn2000cx had an anomalously weak @xmath6-band secondary maximum .",
