    "when investigating the propagation of waves , one has to deal with the fact that the supporting medium often is not perfectly homogeneous , but suffers from irregularities . a standard method is then to assume that the material coefficients characterizing the medium are random , being homogeneous only in average .",
    "examples abound : shallow water waves travelling in a canal with uneven bottom , radar waves propagating through turbulent air , elastic waves dispersing in a random compound of two materials .",
    "the arguably simplest prototype is the scalar wave equation @xmath3 with a random index of refraction @xmath4",
    ". we will be interested in the case where the randomness is frozen in , or at most varies slowly on the time scale of the wave propagation .",
    "to say , we assume @xmath5 to be a stationary stochastic process with short range correlations .    an important special case is a random medium with a small variance of @xmath6 , which one can write as @xmath7 with @xmath8 order @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as argued many times , ranging from isotope disordered harmonic crystals to seismic waves propagating in the crust of the earth , for such weak disorder a kinetic description becomes possible and offers a valuable approximation to the complete equation ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] )  we refer to the highly instructive survey by ryzhik , keller and papanicolaou @xcite for details . in the kinetic limit",
    "one considers times of order @xmath2 and spatial distances of order @xmath2 . on that scale ,",
    "the wigner function @xmath11 associated to the solution @xmath12 of ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] ) is , in a good approximation , governed by the boltzmann type transport equation @xmath13 here @xmath14 , the physical space , and @xmath15 denotes the wave number .",
    "@xmath16 is the dispersion relation , @xmath17 with @xmath18 for ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] ) .",
    "note that the left hand side of ( [ eq : genbtransporteq ] ) is the semiclassical approximation to ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] ) with @xmath19 .",
    "the collision operator on the right hand side of ( [ eq : genbtransporteq ] ) describes the scattering from the inhomogeneities with a rate kernel @xmath20 which depends on the particular model under consideration .    despite the wide use of the kinetic approximation ( [ eq : genbtransporteq ] ) , there is no complete mathematical justification for the step from microscopic equations like ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] ) , together with ( [ eq : smalldisord ] ) , to ( [ eq : genbtransporteq ] ) apart from one exception : erds and yau @xcite ( see also @xcite ) investigate the random schrdinger equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-valued wave function .",
    "this equation can be thought of as a two component wave equation for our purposes . in @xcite",
    "it is established that ( [ eq : genbtransporteq ] ) becomes valid on the kinetic scale .",
    "of course , the proof exploits special properties of the schrdinger equation . for us",
    "one motivation leading to the present investigation was to understand whether the techniques developed in @xcite carry over to standard wave equations such as ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] ) .",
    "in fact , with the proper adjustments they do , and we are quite confident that also other wave equations with small random coefficients , as e.g.discussed in @xcite , can be treated in the same way . due to the intricate nature of the estimates , we do not claim this to be an easy exercise , but there is a blue - print which now can be followed .    even restricting to the scalar wave equation ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] )",
    "there are choices to be made .",
    "one could add dispersion as @xmath24 or the randomness could sit in the laplacian as @xmath25 with @xmath26 random and @xmath19 . to have a model of physical relevance , in our contribution we will consider a dielectric crystal in the harmonic approximation . if , for simplicity , the crystal structure is simple cubic , then @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are the displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium position .",
    "their movement is governed by newton s equations of motion @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the lattice laplacian , which corresponds to an elastic coupling between nearest neighbour atoms , and @xmath31 is the mass of the atom at @xmath32 .",
    "( [ eq : cubicnewt ] ) can be regarded as the space discretized version of ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] ) .",
    "real crystals come as isotope mixtures .",
    "for instance , natural silicon consists in 92.23% of @xmath33si , 4.68% of @xmath34si , and 3.09% of @xmath35si .",
    "thus @xmath36 and , in the appropriate units , we set @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath28 , are i.i.d .  bounded , mean zero , random variables , in slight generalization of our example .    for the discretized wave equation",
    "the wave vector space is the unit torus @xmath39 . if @xmath16 denotes the dispersion relation for ( [ eq : cubicnewt ] ) , the boltzmann transport equation becomes @xmath40 \\int \\ !",

    "in fact , we will allow for more general elastic couplings between the crystal atoms than given in ( [ eq : cubicnewt ] ) .",
    "our precise assumptions on @xmath16 will be discussed in section [ sec : assumptions ] .    in passing ,",
    "let us remark that , to compute the thermal conductivity of real crystals , scattering from isotope disorder contributes only as one part .",
    "at least equally important are weak non - linearities in the elastic couplings , see @xcite for an exhaustive discussion . in addition , at low temperatures , roughly below @xmath41 for silicon , lattice vibrations have to be quantized .",
    "however , for isotope disorder as in ( [ eq : defmi ] ) quantization would not make any difference , since the corresponding heisenberg equations of motion are also linear .    in a loosely related work , bal , komorowski , and ryzhik",
    "@xcite study the high frequency limit of ( [ eq : randomwaveeq ] ) and ( [ eq : smalldisord ] ) , under the assumption that the initial data vary on a space scale @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "they prove that the wigner function is well approximated by a transport equation of the form ( [ eq : genbtransporteq ] ) .",
    "only the boltzmann collision operator is to be replaced by its small angle approximation . thus according to the limit equation the wave vector @xmath15 diffuses on the sphere @xmath44 , whereas in ( [ eq : genbtransporteq ] ) it would be a random jump process .",
    "their method is disjoint from ours and would not be able to cover the limiting case @xmath45 .",
    "al._also prove self - averaging of the limit wigner function , while our result will concern only the disorder averaged wigner function .",
    "we expect however to have self - averaging of the wigner function also in our case , see @xcite for the corresponding result for the lattice random schrdinger equation ( [ eq : randomsch ] ) .",
    "wave propagation in a random medium has been studied also away from the weak disorder regime . as the main novelty , at strong disorder , and at any disorder in space dimension @xmath9 , propagation is suppressed .",
    "the wave equation has localized eigenmodes .",
    "we refer to the review article @xcite .",
    "the regime of extended eigenmodes is still unaccessible mathematically .",
    "the kinetic limit can be viewed as yielding some , even though rather modest , information on the delocalized eigenmodes , compare with @xcite .    in the following section we provide a more precise definition of the model ,",
