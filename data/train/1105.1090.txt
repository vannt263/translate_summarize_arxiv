    "progress in the field of ultracold molecules has been rapidly growing for the past decade , as many atomic and molecular research groups have turned towards the study of either production or dynamics of ultracold diatomic molecules . the success behind the study of ultracold molecular formation lies in the use of photoassociation and feshbach resonances ( see jones _",
    "_ @xcite and khler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) . using a combination of photoassociation and stirap@xcite ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) the formation of vibrational ground state krb@xcite and cs@xmath1@xcite molecules have been reported . with this prospect of ground vibrational diatoms in mind",
    "we focus our study to the interaction effects of a colliding lithium atom with that of a @xmath2 singlet lithium diatom .",
    "knowledge of both the long- and short - range@xcite interaction potential can be used to calculate inelastic three body rates@xcite as well as investigate efimov collisions.@xcite    the assumption of a vibrational ground state diatom greatly simplifies the physics of the interaction , however the complexity of calculating long - range interactions for even the @xmath2 range of motion of the diatom is significant .",
    "given this we work within the frozen diatom approximation , which entails freezing the diatom at the calculated equilibrium bond length for the entire potential energy surface , which is analogous to vibrationally averaging the diatom over the course of the collision .",
    "the long - range interaction is not strongly effected by this approximation due to the small linear changes seen in the diatomic polarizability as the diatom undergoes small oscillations . here",
    "then the polarizability averaged over the vibrational motion is just the polarizability evaluated at @xmath3 .",
    "the validity of the rigid rotor approximation for short atom - diatom collisional distances was found to be good for distances greater than @xmath4 .",
    "we structure this work into the following three parts , first is the discussion of the _ ab initio _ calculations . here",
    "we discuss the methodology involved in choosing the appropriate basis set which provides both the optimal values for the spectroscopic constants as well as the best atomic static polarizability .",
    "further improvement to the interaction energy is shown to come from accounting for basis set superposition error through a counterpoise correction@xcite and from extrapolating the counterpoise corrected energies to the complete basis limit .",
    "next we present a summary of the long - range van der waals interaction for the tri - atomic dissociation limit .",
    "an account of the many - body terms arising from third and fourth order rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory that contribute to the three - atom @xmath5 and @xmath6 van der waals coefficients is given .",
    "finally we present the long - range analytic van der waals atom - diatom interaction energy of cvita _",
    "et al._@xcite and our fitted non - additive van der waals coefficients .",
    "the long - range potential energy surface for the @xmath0 li@xmath7 state has been calculated within a frozen diatom approximation for collisional angles near the @xmath8 geometry , which corresponds to a lithium diatom in the @xmath9 state colliding with a single @xmath10 state lithium atom .",
    "the long - range potential energy surface was calculated for atom - diatom distances ranging from @xmath4  to @xmath11 , a region we consider to be both outside of any consideration of charge overlap yet still well within the very - long - range limit where the retarded potential starts contributing .",
    "the collisional angle sampling of @xmath12 degrees ( where @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath8 geometry in jacobi @xmath14 coordinates ) is both sufficient for an accurate fit and consistent with our previous work on the near equilibrium geometry potential energy surface.@xcite all electronic energy calculations in this work were done correlating all electrons using spin restricted coupled cluster theory with singles , doubles and iterative triples@xcite ( rccsd(t ) ) as implemented in the molpro 2008.1@xcite suite of _ ab initio _ programs .",
    "cold scattering calculations require exceptionally accurate interaction potentials in order to properly predict cross - sections and scattering lengths . to provide this accuracy",
    "we apply a series of corrections to the rccsd(t ) energy which account for deficiencies within the basis set .",
    "additionally we correlate all electrons in the rccsd(t ) energy so as to account for the core - core and core - valence ( cv ) contributions .",
    "the inclusion of cv correlation energy has been shown to account for roughly @xmath15  for multiple bonds and several hundred @xmath16 to atomization energies.@xcite to properly correlate all electrons within an _ ab initio _",
    "calculation necessitates the use of a cv consistent basis set.@xcite we have examined the use of the four and five zeta cc - pvnz basis sets from feller@xcite and the cv consistent cvnz basis sets of iron _",
    "et al._@xcite in table [ diaspectro ] is a comparison between calculated spectroscopic constants from the above basis sets and the experimental values , it can be seen that the five zeta basis sets provide a marked improvement in terms of both @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "the calculated polarizability is also used as a benchmark calculation in addition to @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "the accuracy of which is a strong indicator of the accuracy of the atomic static polarizability is a strong indicator of the accuracy of long - range molecular dispersion interactions .",
    "the first improvement to the trimer potential energy surface was to calculate the basis set superposition error ( bsse ) through a counterpoise calculation.@xcite the interaction energy of the trimer is then @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy of the resulting atom when atoms @xmath20 and @xmath21 within the trimer are replaced with dummy centers .",
    "accounting for bsse the cvqz basis provides a correction of @xmath22 @xmath16 and the cv5z basis has a correction of @xmath23 @xmath16 . across the total long - range surface",
    "the total bsse correction varies no more than 1% , finally converging to a constant value at interaction regions greater than @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the bsse corresponds to the diatom and not the atom - diatom interaction itself .",
    "still this counterpoise correction does not fully account for all of the dissociation energy of the li@xmath1 diatom .",
    "we further improve upon the accuracy of the potential energy surface by extrapolating the counterpoise corrected energies to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit .",
    "we use the cbs limit extrapolation formulation of helgaker _",
    "et al._@xcite @xmath25 this extrapolation scheme was applied to the cvqz and cv5z counterpoise corrected interaction energies for the final potential energy surface calculation .",
    "we calculate the static polarizability for the ground state lithium atom and singlet lithium diatom with the static field method@xcite by calculating the rccsd(t ) energies in the presence of an electric dipole field ( given here as @xmath26 ) .",
    "the static polarizability is given by the finite field gradient @xmath27 and reported in table [ polarizability ] .",
    "the dispersion energy between two monomers at long - range ( no charge overlap ) can be expressed as@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the static polarizability for the @xmath20th monomer and @xmath30 is a characteristic excitation energy of the moleculeld s approximation as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is usually set to the first two excitation energies.@xcite ] . due to the important contribution of the long - range tail of the electron wave function to the molecular polarizability , the effects of adding diffuse functions can be significant . in the calculation of the polarizability discussed above , a set of even tempered diffuse functions",
    "were added to the cvnz basis sets and found to contribute little to the extrapolated polarizability .",
    "a further test on the effect of adding diffuse functions was performed by evaluating a cbs extrapolated single point energy calculation at @xmath4  with the even tempered diffuse functions discussed above .",
    "the results showed that in the cbs limit the difference between the standard and augmented cvnz basis sets amounts to less than half a wavenumber .",
    "because the long - range interaction depends explicitly upon the monomer static polarizability , it is clear from the reported atomic static polarizability in table [ polarizability ] that the cvnz basis sets are the optimal .",
    "the variation in theoretically reported parallel and perpendicular polarizabilities for the lithium diatom ( see deiglmayr _",
    "et al_@xcite for a review of alkali diatomic static polarizabilities ) do not offer a significant constraint on the chosen basis set .",
    "our final recommended calculations make use of the counterpoise correction with the extrapolation to the cbs limit as discussed above .",
    "we expect that our calculated diatomic long - range interactions will be suitably accurate given the precision of the calculated spectroscopic values and static atomic polarizability .",
    "we now examine the trimer potential energy surface at the three atom dissociation limit , which is expanded analytically in terms of the two - body dispersion interactions with the addition of a purely three - body interaction potential .",
    "the three - body contribution to the interaction energy is well known to be strong for li@xmath7 , for both the doublet@xcite and quartet@xcite state .",
    "thus it is important to accurately include such effects in any model of the long - range interaction . by using perturbation theory to examine this expansion",
    "it is possible to express the generalized dispersion coefficients in terms of known diatom and triatomic constants .",
    "our goal in this section is to overview the essential theory of three - body atomic interactions , which can then be specialized to the case of atom - diatom interactions within the frozen diatom approximation previously discussed .",
    "the tri - atomic dissociation interaction potential can be described in terms of the diatomic van der waals interaction potential @xmath33 and non - additive many - body potential @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the three internuclear vectors .",
    "long - range dispersion interaction potentials ( excluding retardation and orbital overlap effects ) between two s - state atoms are described using the multipole expansion @xmath37 where the @xmath5 and @xmath6 coefficients are respectively the dipole - dipole , quadrupole - quadrupole and dipole - octopole expansions@xcite of the inter - atomic electrostatic hamiltonian @xmath38 . to obtain the leading terms of the non - additive potential @xmath34 in eq .",
    "[ thestart ] , the analogous expansion method used for the diatom van der waals interaction can be used . here",
    ", rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs ) perturbation theory is applied to the total inter - atomic interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the atomic hamiltonian for the @xmath41th atomic , then expanded by multipole moments .",
    "the desired contributions to the non - additive potential @xmath34 arise from the first many - body terms in third order rs perturbation theory .",
    "the bipolar expansion of the many - body terms from third order rs perturbation theory leads to a summation of purely geometric factors with interaction constants dependent on the atomic species@xcite , @xmath42 the interaction constant can be expressed with the casimir - polder integral of the dynamic @xmath43 polarizabilities@xcite over complex frequencies @xmath44 with the dynamic polarizability defined as@xcite @xmath45 and the @xmath46 oscillator strength defined as latexmath:[\\[f^{(l)}_{n0}=\\frac{8\\pi}{2l+1}e_{n }    over @xmath20 goes over all the electrons in the given atom and @xmath48 is again the excitation energy for state n. the geometric factors @xmath49 have been reported by a number of authors@xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the first term in the third order expansion can be identified as the well known axilrod - teller - muto triple - dipole@xcite term .",
    "additionally , it has been identified that the quadruple dipole term @xmath50 , from fourth order perturbation theory , has a contribution to the van der waals dispersion coefficients of consideration here .",
    "this term has no exact expression in terms of the dynamic polarizabilities@xcite , but it can be approximated using a drude oscillator model in the case of three @xmath51 state atoms . using the corresponding drude oscillator approximation for the @xmath5 van der waals dispersion coefficient",
    ", the @xmath50 term can be approximated as@xcite @xmath52 using the values @xmath53 and @xmath54 from yan _",
