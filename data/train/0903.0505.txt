    "one of the main sources of gravitational radiation for the future esa - nasa gravitational wave observatory , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite , is the capture and inspiral of a stellar - mass compact object ( sco ) , with masses in the range @xmath0 , into a massive black hole ( mbh ) in a galactic centre , with masses in the range @xmath1 .",
    "these systems are usually known as extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) since the mass ratios involved are in the range @xmath2 . during the inspiral phase the system is driven by the emission of gravitational radiation , and",
    "hence there is loss of energy and angular momentum that makes the orbit shrink until the sco plunges into the mbh .",
    "it is expected that lisa will be able to detect @xmath3 emri@xmath4  @xcite up to distances within @xmath5  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for more details on the astrophysics of emris ) .",
    "recently , it has been suggested  @xcite that inspirals of scos into intermediate - mass black holes , with masses in the range @xmath6 and presumably located in globular clusters , could be detected by future second - generation ground interferometers like advanced ligo  @xcite and advanced virgo  @xcite .",
    "the mass ratios are in the range @xmath7 , and in consequence they are called intermediate - mass - ratio inspirals ( imris ) .",
    "it is expected that techniques to describe emris may also been used for imris , at least to a certain degree of precision .    during the long inspiral",
    ", an emri will spend many cycles inside the lisa band , of the order of @xmath8 during the last year before plunge into the mbh  @xcite .",
    "however , the gravitational - wave signals from emris will be buried in the lisa data stream with the instrumental noise and the gravitational wave foreground ( produced by compact binaries in the lisa band ) .",
    "to extract these signals and the relevant physical parameters that characterize them , we need to have a very precise _ a priori _ theoretical knowledge of the gravitational waveforms .",
    "this means to describe the inspiral of the sco taking into account the gravitational backreaction , that is , the influence of the sco gravitational field on its own motion .",
    "this is an interesting but difficult theoretical problem , and different methods have been developed to solve it ( see  @xcite ) .    while techniques for constructing templates good enough for detection are getting ready , mainly based on the use of the adiabatic approximation  @xcite , methods to build templates good enough for extraction of physical information are not yet fully developed .",
    "the main difficulty being that one requires a more precise treatment of the self - gravity of the sco and its impact on the gravitational waveform . in relation to this fact",
    ", there is currently a significant activity on the study of the accuracy of the different types of adiabatic approximations that have been introduced  @xcite . on the other hand , the _ self - force _ approach to the equations of motion  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) is an step forward to a precise estimation of the radiation - reaction effects and in consequence , towards the construction of accurate waveform templates . in this approach",
    "the backreaction effects on the sco are described as the action of a local force , the _ self - force _ , which can be computed in terms of the perturbations generated by the sco with respect the mbh background spacetime . in practice , to compute the self - force one needs to regularize the perturbations , similarly as it happens in electromagnetism  @xcite . to that end",
    ", a _ mode sum _ regularization scheme has been designed ( in the gravitational case it has been formulated in the lorenz gauge )  @xcite .",
    "it tells us how to subtract , mode by mode ( for a schwarzschild mbh the modes correspond to a harmonic decomposition of the perturbations ) , the singular part of the perturbations that does not contribute to the self - force .",
    "therefore , what we need is a method of computing the full retarded solution of the perturbative equations for applying the mode - sum regularization scheme and obtain in this way the self - force .",
    "the perturbative field equations are a set of ten linear partial differential equations ( pdes ) for the metric perturbations @xmath9 ( @xmath10 at linear order , where @xmath11 is the spacetime metric and @xmath12 is the background metric describing the mbh ) , which only in certain gauges ( e.g. , the regge - wheeler gauge  @xcite ) can be decoupled . in any case , to solve them completely we need to resort to numerical methods . following the initial studies of black hole quasinormal modes , frequency methods were used successfully  @xcite , and it was found they provide accurate results for emris with moderate eccentricities",
    ". however , the frequency domain approach has more difficulties with highly eccentric orbits , which are of interest for lisa , since one has to sum over a large number of modes to obtain a good accuracy , and convergence may be an issue .",
    "this has opened the door to time - domain methods , which are not affected much by the eccentricity of the orbit and may be more efficient for the case of high - eccentricity emris . in the last years",
    "there has been an intense activity on this front , both for a nonrotating background  @xcite , and for a rotating background  @xcite .",
    "the main drawbacks of time - domain methods have mainly two origins : ( i ) the fact that one has to resolve very different physical scales ( both spatial and temporal ) present in the problem due to the extreme mass ratios involved ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . that is , using a standard numerical discretization of the problem we are led to resolve the typical gravitational wavelengths ( comparable to the size of the mbh ) and , at the same time , scales in the vicinity of the sco , which are crucial for evaluating the self - force .",
    "this translates in a demanding requirement of computational resources .",
    "( ii ) the fact that the sco is described as a point - like object .",
    "this introduces dirac delta distributions in the sco energy - momentum distribution that lead to loss of differentiability in the solution of the perturbative field equations .",
    "this fact can degrade the convergence properties of the numerical algorithms used .",
    "moreover , such a localized distribution of matter can also introduce spurious high - frequency modes that contaminate the numerical solution and , in consequence , degrade its accuracy .",
    "recently , there have been different proposals to improve the performance of time domain methods .",
    "barack and goldbourn  @xcite have introduced a new technique to compute the scalar field generated by a pointlike scalar charge orbiting a black hole .",
    "this technique consists in subtracting from each azimuthal mode ( in the kerr geometry the field equations are not fully separable in the time domain and one has to tackle them in 2 + 1 dimensions ) of the retarded field a piece that describes the singular behavior near the particle .",
    "this is done through a careful analytical study of the scalar field near the particle , using a _ puncture _ scheme which resembles the puncture model used for simulations in numerical relativity  @xcite .",
    "this technique has been extended to the electromagnetic and gravitational cases by barack , goldbourn and sago  @xcite . on the other hand , vega and detweiler  @xcite",
    "have introduced another new method for regularizing the solution of the field equations .",
    "their approach , tested on a simplified model of a charged particle orbiting a nonrotating black hole , regularizes the retarded field itself by identifying and removing first , in an analytical way , the singular part of the retarded field .",
    "this alternative approach to the mode - sum regularization scheme yields a finite and differentiable remainder from which the self - force can be computed .",
    "this remainder is the solution to a field equation with a nonsingular source , which avoid the problem ( ii ) above .",
    "finally , lousto and nakano  @xcite have also introduced an analytical technique to remove the particle singular behaviour .",
    "their method is global and also produces a well behaved source for the field equations .",
    "whereas these new techniques help in dealing with problem ( ii ) above , they do not completely solve the problem ( i ) since the regular source terms that these new schemes produce still have associated with them a length scale ( or , from the numerical point of view , there are still special spatial resolution requirements associated with those source terms ) . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new time - domain scheme towards the computation of the self - force which , for the case of a nonrotating black hole , eliminates completely any length scale associated with the sco .",
    "this is done by using multiple subdomains and locating the particle in the interface between two of them ( this has similarities with what was done in  @xcite using the finite element method , where in one of the numerical schemes proposed the particle was located between two elements ) . in this way",
    ", the dirac delta distributions do not appear in our equations and the presence of the sco enters through the boundary conditions that communicate the solutions at the different subdomains . as a consequence , we are solving wave - type equations with smooth solutions , which avoid the problems described in ( ii ) ( preliminary results have been reported in  @xcite ) . regarding ( i )",
    ", we just need to provide the numerical resolution to describe the field near the particle , but not the particle itself , which makes the computation much more efficient .",
    "our numerical algorithms are based on the pseudospectral collocation ( psc ) method ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , which has been applied to numerical relativity  @xcite , and recently it has also been used in  @xcite for one - dimensional head - on collisions of black - holes . and very recently , in  @xcite , a discontinuous galerkin method has been introduced and some gravitational waveforms for extreme - mass - ratio binaries are computed .",
    "this work uses similar techniques to the ones introduced in  @xcite and the ones that we present here .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a set of techniques and methods to use the psc for the computation of the self - force on a charged scalar particle in circular orbits around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "we also show some results of the numerical implementation .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  [ modeldescription ] we introduce the basics of the model of a charged scalar particle orbiting a nonrotating black hole , including the basic formulae for the computation of the self - force via the mode - sum regularization scheme . in section  [ timedomainframework ] we introduce all the ingredients of a new time - domain numerical framework for the computation of the self - force in such scenario , from the mathematical foundations to the practical implementation of the computations . in section  [ results ]",
    "we show the performance of a numerical code we have designed to implement the new scheme , and results of the computation of the self - force , in particular for the innermost stable circular orbit . in section  [ discussion ] we draw conclusions from the results shown and discuss possible future avenues in the development of these techniques for the simulations of emris in relevant physical situations . throughout this paper",
    "we use the metric signature @xmath13 and geometric units in which @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we present a new technique for the computation of the self - force . in order to simplify things we focus in the particular case of a charged scalar particle in circular geodesics around a non - rotating mbh . in this simplified model , the spacetime metric is not dynamical , in the sense that it is not affected neither by the particle nor by the scalar field that it generates . in our case , since we are considering non - rotating bhs , the metric is the schwarzschild metric , which can be written as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the so - called schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the bh mass ) , and @xmath19 is the _ tortoise _ coordinate , given by : @xmath20 in this geometry we assume there is a particle with scalar charge @xmath21 , associated to a scalar field @xmath22 .",
    "this particle is orbiting the bh , and in doing so generates scalar field @xmath23 , which in turn influences the particle trajectory .",
    "that is , the particle motion is affected by the field created by itself . in this way",
    ", this model contains all the ingredients of the gravitational case , in which the particle motion is influenced by its own gravitational field .",
    "the equation for the scalar field is then ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath24 that is , a wave - type equation with a source term that describes the particle energy density due to its scalar charge . in this equation ,",
    "the spacetime metric @xmath11 is the schwarzschild metric  ( [ schmetric ] ) , @xmath25 denotes the associated canonical connection ; @xmath26 denotes proper time associated with the particle along its timelike worldline @xmath27 , which we denote by @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is the invariant dirac functional in schwarzschild spacetime , which is defined by the relation @xmath30 and the equivalent one for the other argument . in this relation",
    ", @xmath31 denotes the metric determinant . taking into account the properties of @xmath29",
    ", it follows that the source term in the scalar field equation  ( [ geo ] ) only has support on the particle worldline @xmath27 .",
    "the equations of motion for the particle trajectory ( @xmath28 ) that one would obtain from energy - momentum conservation are : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the particle mass and 4-velocity , respectively",
    ". however , this expression is a formal one due to the fact that the force @xmath35 diverges on the particle worldline @xmath27 ( see  @xcite for a derivation of the _ regularized _ equations of motion ) .",
    "an analysis of the solutions of ( [ geo ] ) and ( [ particlemotion ] ) reveals ( see for details  @xcite ) that the gradient of the field , @xmath36 , can be split into two parts  @xcite : a singular piece , @xmath37 , which contains the singular structure of the field and satisfies the same field equation , that is , @xmath38 and a regular part , @xmath39 , which satisfies an homogeneous wave equation @xmath40 and which is solely responsible of the deviation of the particle from geodesic motion around the bh , @xmath41 this part is associated with the tail part of the scalar field .",
    "this is the analogous equation to the _ misataquwa _ equation of the gravitational case ( see  @xcite ) , and @xmath42 is called the _ self - force _ on the particle .    in order to solve the equation for the scalar field [ eq .  ( [ geo ] ) ]",
    "it is very convenient to take advantage of the spherical symmetry of the schwarzschild spacetime and decompose @xmath23 in scalar spherical harmonics , @xmath43 ( see appendix  [ sphericalharmonics ] ) , @xmath44 where the harmonic numbers @xmath45 take the usual values : @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "since we want to compute the self - force on the particle for geodesics orbits , and since geodesic motion takes place on a plane in schwarzschild geometry , we will assume , without loss of generality , that the plane is given by @xmath48 .",
    "we will also parameterize the motion of the particle in terms of the coordinate time @xmath49 , instead of proper time @xmath26 .",
    "that is , the particle world - line , @xmath27 , will be given by @xmath50 .",
    "taking this into account , we can introduce the expansion  ( [ scalarfieldharmonics ] ) into the scalar field equation  ( [ geo ] ) and find that the equations for the different harmonic coefficients @xmath51 decouple and have the form of a 1 + 1 wave - type equation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the regge - wheeler potential for scalar fields on the schwarzschild geometry , given by @xmath54\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath55 is the coefficient of the singular source term generated by the particle : @xmath56 where an overbar denotes complex conjugation .    on a hypersurface @xmath57",
    "we can prescribe initial data for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and then find the corresponding solution ( given that @xmath23 satisfies a wave equation , the problem is well - posed ) .",
    "there are a couple of comments in order : first , the solution found in this way corresponds to the @xmath45 contribution to the full retarded solution .",
    "second , this solution will be finite and continuous at the particle location , but it will not be differentiable at the particle location in the sense that the radial derivative from the left and from the right of the particle yields different values .",
    "moreover , the sum of the multipole coefficients over @xmath60 will diverge at the particle location .",
    "this can be fixed by extracting , multipole by multipole , the singular part of the scalar field .",
    "since we are interested on regularizing the self - force , which is defined at the particle location , let us introduce first a multipolar decomposition of the gradient of the scalar field",
    "@xmath61 so that the gradient of the retarded field is given by @xmath62 obviously , @xmath63 also diverges at the particle worldline although the @xmath64 are finite .",
    "following the discussion of the previous section , the gradient of @xmath23 , and hence the self - force , can be regularized by splitting the full retarded field into a singular part and a regular part ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) , such that they satisfy equations ( [ eqsingular])-([regparticlemotion ] ) .",
    "that is , the regular part of the gradient of the scalar field will be given , on the particle location , by @xmath65 the singular field @xmath66 is known in a neighborhood of the particle worldline .",
    "in particular , the multipoles of the singular part of the gradient of the scalar field at the particle worldline are given by  @xcite : @xmath67\\ , ,   \\label{l_sing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ,  are called the regularization parameters  @xcite .",
    "they are independent of @xmath60 , but depend on the particle dynamics .",
    "the singular part corresponds to the first three terms which lead to quadratic , linear , and logarithmical divergences when we sum over @xmath60 .",
    "the remaining terms form a convergent series that does not contribute to the self - force ( each of them ) . in our approximate calculations ,",
    "we maintain the @xmath71 term as it accelerates the convergence of the series as we increase the number of multipoles included  @xcite .",
    "for the case of interest of this work , circular geodesics , the non - vanishing regularization parameters are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74  @xcite , which can be written as follows : @xmath75 @xmath76\\ , ,   \\label{br}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a sign that takes the value @xmath79 when the limit in equation  ( [ l_sing ] ) is performed from the _ right _ ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 when the limit is performed from the _ left _ ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath83 can be computed in terms of hypergeometric functions as follows ( see  @xcite , equation  ( 15.1.1 ) ) : @xmath84 since the only non - vanishing component of the regularization coefficients is the radial one , this is the only component of the self - force that is actually singular , and hence the only one to be regularized . in this way",
    "the regularized self - force is : @xmath85",
    "in this section we introduce all the ingredients of a new time - domain method to evolve the equation(s ) for a scalar field generated by a charged particle orbiting a nonrotating black hole , and also to compute the self - force from the evolved solution .",
    "we are going to introduce some mathematical developments needed in order to compute , using numerical algorithms based on the psc method , the self - force on a charged particle on circular geodesics .",
    "we discuss first the particular formulation that we implement numerically . since our numerical framework deals with multiple domains it is useful to adopt a first - order formulation of the scalar field equation .",
    "the main reason is that first - order formulations of pdes can be adapted to the hyperbolic character of the underlying equation , and hence they are suitable for a correct communication between domains .",
    "we perform a first - order reduction of ( [ master ] ) by introducing the following new variables @xmath86 the evolution equations for @xmath87 , that is for a given harmonic @xmath45 , written in matrix form , are : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 it can be seen that  ( [ evosystem ] ) is a first - order symmetric hyperbolic system of pdes , that is , it has the maximum degree of hyperbolicity , as expected of a system that comes from the reduction of a wave - type equation .",
    "the characteristic structure is described by the matrix @xmath91 .    given that discontinuities in the solution are only allowed across characteristics , and given that due to the singular character of the source some of our variables will have jumps across the radial particle location , it is important to study these jumps using the formulation just introduced . to approach this question",
    "it is convenient to divide the spatial domain ( the radial direction as parametrized by the coordinate @xmath19 ) into two disjoint regions , one to the left of the particle ( @xmath92 ) , and one to the right of the particle ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "then , we can write the solution of the equations  ( [ evosystem ] ) in the form  ( see also  @xcite ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the heaviside step function . introducing  ( [ globalsolution ] ) into  ( [ evosystem ] ) we can derive the jump across the particle location , defined as @xmath96^{}_{p } } = \\mathop{\\lim } \\limits_{{r^{\\ast}}\\to { r^{\\ast}}_{p}}\\lambda^{}_{+}(t , { r^{\\ast } } ) -\\mathop{\\lim } \\limits_{{r^{\\ast}}\\to { r^{\\ast}}_{p}}\\lambda^{}_{-}(t , { r^{\\ast}})\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the different variables of our problem .",
    "we find the following result : @xmath97^{}_{p } } = 0\\,,~~   { \\left[\\,\\phi^{m}_{\\ell}\\,\\right]^{}_{p } } = 0\\,,~~ { \\left[\\,\\varphi^{m}_{\\ell}\\,\\right]^{}_{p } } =   \\frac{s^{m}_{\\ell}}{f(r_p)}\\ , .",
    "\\label{jump}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are the conditions we have to impose in our numerical evolution algorithm . in practice , these conditions have to be imposed on the _ characteristic _ fields , the fields associated to the characteristics . in our problem",
    "there are two different types of characteristics : ( i ) the @xmath98 surfaces , and ( ii ) the null surfaces @xmath99 .",
    "the associated characteristic fields are @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively .    finally , our system of equations has to be complemented with initial conditions and boundary conditions .",
    "the initial conditions , since we are dealing with a first - order system of pdes , consist in prescribing @xmath102 . we need boundary conditions at the ends of the spatial domain .",
    "the physical spatial domain is @xmath103 , with @xmath104 corresponds to the horizon location , while @xmath105 corresponds to spatial infinity . in our numerical computations",
    "we will take a _ truncated _ domain : @xmath106 $ ] , and therefore we need to prescribe outgoing boundary conditions at the ends of that domain ( also called _ absorbing _ boundary conditions ) . as an approximation",
    "we take the conditions that are exact for the case in which there is no potential , that is @xmath107 & & \\phi^{m}_{\\ell}(t,{r^{\\ast}}_{{{\\mbox{\\tiny i } } } } ) + \\varphi^{m}_{\\ell}(t,{r^{\\ast}}_{{{\\mbox{\\tiny i } } } } ) = 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{outgoingbcs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the leading approximation for the outgoing boundary conditions . they can be improved by analyzing the solution near @xmath108 .",
    "however , we can always take values of @xmath109 such that the boundaries are not in causal contact with the particle location , avoiding contamination of the solution due to propagation of unphysical modes from the boundaries .",
    "we now describe in some detail the numerical techniques we use to solve for the full retarded scalar field and to compute from it the regularized self - force .    in order to solve for the pdes that describe the scalar field , equations  ( [ evosystem ] )",
    ", we use the psc to discretize in space . once this",
    "is done we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that can be solve by using the method of lines ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) applying a convenient ode solver .",
    "in general , spectral methods can approximate solutions of pdes by expanding the variables in a given basis of functions , and then by using an appropriate criterium that forces this expansion to approach the exact solution as we increase the number of functions included in the expansion .",
    "in the case of the psc method , the criterium consist in imposing the solution exactly at a set of _ collocation _ points ( see , e.g.  @xcite , for details on the psc method ) . in our work ,",
    "we use the chebyshev polynomials , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 $ ] ) , as the basis functions ( see appendix  [ chebyshev ] for definitions ) , and for the collocation points we take a _",
    "lobatto - chebyshev _ grid .",
    "if we want to use a grid of @xmath112 collocation points , the lobatto - chebyshev grid is made out of the zeros of the following polynomial  ( see appendix  [ chebyshev ] ) : @xmath113 where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "the zeros can be written as follows : @xmath115 now , we need to map the domain in which the chebyshev polynomials are defined ( we will call it the _ spectral domain _ ) to the physical domain . before doing that",
    ", we have to mention that for computational reasons that we discuss later , we split the computational domain , @xmath116 $ ] , into a number of subdomains ( @xmath117 ) : @xmath118\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the left and right boundaries of the subdomain @xmath121 .",

    "the cardinal functions have the following remarkable property : @xmath139 in this way , the time - dependent ( vector ) coefficients , @xmath140 , of the expansion  ( [ physicalrepresentation ] ) are the values of our variables at the collocation points @xmath141 these are the variables that one looks for in the psc method .",

    "we discuss the details of the time evolution of the discrete equations we derived in the previous section .",

    "the main argument is the following : if we put the particle inside one of the subdomains @xmath121 we are introducing in the equations  ( [ evosystem ] ) a singular term that , in the case of a scalar charged particle , will produce solutions that are not differentiable ( in the sense that the derivative with respect to @xmath19 is not single - valued at the particle location ) .",
    "that is , our solution will not be smooth and hence we can not expect the psc method to converge exponentially to the true solution .",
    "that would spoil one of the main motivations for using this numerical technique , that is , the accuracy that the psc method provides . to avoid this ( and this is part of the reason for using a multi - domain scheme ) we put the particle at the interface between two subdomains .",
    "if the subdomains are @xmath121 and @xmath152 , we have : @xmath153 since we have restricted ourselves to the case of circular orbits , once the grid has been set we do not need to change it during the evolution . in the case of generic orbits , in order to maintain the particle at the interface between two subdomains we have either to make a coordinate change or implement a moving grid scheme ( a similar situation was confronted in  @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "for each subdomain @xmath121 ( @xmath128 ) , we evolve the set of odes  ( [ odes ] ) independently .",
    "since we are locating the particle at the interface between two subdomains , the last term in  ( [ odes ] ) , @xmath154 , does not appear .",
    "this term is the source term that accounts for the particle s energy density [ see equation  ( [ source ] ) ] .",
    "the main implication of this setup is that we have to solve the homogeneous field equations , which are equations with smooth solutions and hence , the advantages of the psc method are preserved .",
    "then , in our framework , the contributions of the particle to the solution appear as boundary conditions between the subdomains . in summary , we evolve the ( homogeneous ) field equations for each subdomain independently and connect their solutions by boundary conditions at the interfaces .",
    "the equations are evolved using a runge - kutta ( rk ) solver ( see  @xcite ) , typically a rk4 algorithm .",
    "the key point in the evolution is the imposition of boundary conditions at the interfaces between subdomains .",
    "there are two possible situations for a given interface : ( i ) the particle is not there . in this case",
    "we only have to impose the continuity of the solution [ that would correspond to imposing the junction conditions given in equation  ( [ jump ] ) with zero right - hand sides ] .",
    "( ii ) the particle is there .",
    "in this case we have to impose the junction conditions in equation  ( [ jump ] ) where @xmath55 is given in equation  ( [ source ] ) .",
    "the question is then how to impose these boundary conditions numerically within our framework .",
    "there are different ways of doing this , and in this work we have chosen to impose this boundary conditions at the interfaces between subdomains in a dynamical way , via _ penalty _ terms .",
    "the penalty method is a well - known technique and has been applied to several numerical schemes to solve pdes ( for the psc method , see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is relatively simple to implement it for elliptic - type problems , that is , for problems that do not require evolution _ in time_. for time - dependent problems , it can also be implemented but the result is not always numerically stable in our framework , the implementation of the penalty method goes as follows : first , let us consider the two domains around the particle s location , say @xmath121 and @xmath152 , so that equation  ( [ particleatinterface ] ) holds . then",

    "this is expected as the mathematical structure of the equation is essentially the same .",
    "the additional ingredient is the excitation of quasinormal modes of the black hole by the initial wave packet .",
    "when we introduce the sco , i.e. the particle , the situation is conceptually different .",
    "if we think in global terms , the presence of the particle implies that the global solution ( the solution in the whole computational domain ) will not be smooth .",
    "hence , we can not expect exponential convergence for the solution of our problem .",
    "however , as we have argued above , our multidomain framework avoids the presence of dirac delta distributions in the equations by locating the particle in the interface between subdomains .",
    "then , the presence of the particle enters through boundary conditions , actually matching conditions between subdomains .",
    "therefore , at each subdomain we will have a smooth solution , and hence we expect our numerical solution to converge exponentially towards it . in our numerical experiments with a particle ( remember we restrict ourselves to the case of circular orbits ) , we take _ zero initial data _ , that is @xmath184 this initial data is obviously not consistent with einstein s equations , and as a consequence the evolution produces an initial unphysical burst .",
    "we have to wait until this unphysical feature propagates away in order to analyze the solution and obtain physically relevant results . in figure  [ detailsevolution ]",
    "we show snapshots of the evolution of a scalar charged particle in circular motion at the last stable orbit ( lso ) , in principle the most demanding case ( in schwarzschild the lso is located at @xmath185 ) .",
    "the figure includes details of the different variables , @xmath186 for @xmath187 , near the particle location .",
    "these snapshots illustrate the ability of our method to capture the structure of the solution near the particle , in particular the ability of resolving the jump in the radial derivative of the field ( snapshot on the right in figure  [ detailsevolution ] ) .            in order to further validate our numerical code ,",
    "we have performed simulations with the particle at the lso changing the number of collocation points , while leaving the number of subdomains fixed . in this way we have checked that our method can achieve the exponential convergence in each individual subdomain . in figure  [ convergencewithparticle ] we show a convergence plot obtained from simulations that use four subdomains : @xmath188\\cup[-20\\,m,0]\\cup [ 0,20\\,m]\\cup [ 20\\,m,550\\,m]$ ] .",

    "the data , taken from the subdomain @xmath191 $ ] indicates the exponential convergence of the numerical method .",
    "[ convergencewithparticle],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the multidomain feature of our method is useful for another important reason , namely computational cost .",
    "it is not the same having @xmath112 points in @xmath117 domains that having @xmath192 points in one single domain .",
    "this is an important fact to be considered in a situation where the need for resolution comes only from some isolated regions of the computational domain .",
    "this is what happens in our problem and the type of multidomain structure can have dramatic consequences in the calculations .",
    "first of all , for computations in a given time step , the first option involves less calculations .",
    "second , from the evolution point of view , in the psc method , the courant - friedrichs - lax ( cfl ) condition on the allowed size of the time step , @xmath193 , is more stringent than in finite differences ( fd ) schemes . for the psc method",
    "the maximum allowed time step is @xmath194 ( this is set by the minimum distance between two collocation points , which occurs at the boundaries of the subdomains  @xcite ) , that is , it goes like @xmath195 with respect to the number of collocation points , whereas in fd schemes it goes like @xmath196 .",
    "then , dividing the domain in subdomains can help in having a bigger @xmath197 .",
    "in addition , the multidomain scheme can be seen as a way of adaptivity , in the sense that we can construct small subdomains for the regions that need to be well resolved , essentially near the particle , and large subdomains for the regions that do not need to have high resolution , essentially far away from the particle .    in order to illustrate how the multidomain feature of our numerical framework works ,",
    "we have performed simulations with a fixed number of collocation points but changing the number of subdomains .",
    "the aim is to show how the solution improves by adding new subdomains . in our simulations ,",
    "the most demanding region for resolution is clearly near the particle .",
    "apart from this we have the waves leaving the particle location and going both towards the horizon and towards spatial infinity .",
    "these waves are in principle easy to resolve , but for modes with high @xmath60 and @xmath33 we have that the source term oscillates like @xmath198 ( where @xmath199 is the coordinate angular velocity of the particle ) , and hence the wavelength gets reduced so that we have many more waves that for low @xmath33 .",
    "these waves are moving away and need to be resolved . in figure  [ multidomainshow ]",
    "we show snapshots of evolutions with @xmath200 collocation points per subdomain , but with different number of subdomains , namely from @xmath201 to @xmath202 subdomains ( half of them to the left of particle and the other half to the right ) .",
    "the figure shows the mode @xmath203 and @xmath204 ( so that the period of the waves is @xmath205 ) for the three fields @xmath206 .",
    "we can see how for few subdomains the waves are unresolved , and that as we increase the number of subdomains the solution converges .",
    "therefore , the multidomain structure is a very useful tool to achieve accurate results with a reasonable computational cost .",
    "the key point is to realize what is the optimal number of subdomains , their size , and their distribution over the whole computational domain . given that in our case the period of the waves changes with the harmonic number @xmath33 , the optimal strategy for setting the subdomain will depend on it .",
    "however , since the main aim of this work is to show the principal ingredients of the method and to illustrate its performance , we have not explored the possibility of changing the subdomain structure as @xmath33 changes . however , this is something that should be done for optimizing the computational cost in the case of systematic calculations of the self - force . in this sense , it would be convenient to have a deep understanding of the computational parameter space in order to automatically adapt these parameters to the physical parameters and optimize in this way the calculations .",
    "this would require an extensive investigation that will be done and presented elsewhere .",
    "the next step in the validation of the code is to compute the components of the self - force acting on the charged scalar particle moving in circular geodesics around a nonrotating black hole .",
    "this is the goal of this numerical scheme , that is , to provide accurate computations of the self - force with reasonable computational cost .",

    "there are several ways in which we can attack this problem .",
    "one is to try to implement some type of moving grid technique ( as it was done in a similar situation in  @xcite ) , but the reconstruction of the grid at every time step could increase significantly the computational cost of the evolution .",
    "another possibility is to try to make a change of coordinates to coordinates comoving with the particle , so that the techniques presented in this paper can be implemented in a straightforward way .    on the other hand",
    ", we expect that mbhs sitting at galactic centers will have considerable spins ( @xmath237 or bigger , where @xmath238 is the kerr spin parameter ) and hence the mbh should be described by the kerr metric instead of the schwarzschild metric .",

    "one can separate the dependence on the azimuthal angle and is left with @xmath239 wave - type equations with singular terms .",
    "the main difficulty in this case is that each @xmath33-mode ( coming from the separation of the azimuthal angle ) diverges logarithmically at the particle location .",

    "<S> the description of the inspiral of a stellar - mass compact object into a massive black hole sitting at a galactic centre is a problem of major relevance for the future space - based gravitational - wave observatory lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) , as the signals from these systems will be buried in the data stream and accurate gravitational - wave templates will be needed to extract them . </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty in describing these systems lies in the estimation of the gravitational effects of the stellar - mass compact object on his own trajectory around the massive black hole , which can be modeled as the action of a local force , the _ self - force_. in this paper , we present a new time - domain numerical method for the computation of the self - force in a simplified model consisting of a charged scalar particle orbiting a nonrotating black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we use a multi - domain framework in such a way that the particle is located at the interface between two domains so that the presence of the particle and its physical effects appear only through appropriate boundary conditions . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we eliminate completely the presence of a small length scale associated with the need of resolving the particle . </S>",
    "<S> this technique also avoids the problems associated with the impact of a low differentiability of the solution in the accuracy of the numerical computations . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial discretization of the field equations is done by using the pseudospectral collocation method and the time evolution , based on the method of lines , uses a runge - kutta solver . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this special framework can provide very efficient and accurate computations in the time domain , which makes the technique amenable for the intensive computations required in the astrophysically - relevant scenarios for lisa . </S>"
