    "contact formation ( cyclization ) between the ends of a long polymer has been intensely studied both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the kinetics of loop formation has become increasingly important largely because of its relevance to dna looping @xcite as well as protein @xcite and rna folding @xcite .",
    "the ease of cyclization in dna , which is a measure of its intrinsic flexibility @xcite , is important in gene expression and interactions with proteins and rna .",
    "in addition , the formation of contacts between residues ( nucleotides ) near the loop @xcite may be the key nucleating event in protein ( rna ) folding .",
    "for these reasons , a number of experiments have probed the dependence of the rates of cyclization in proteins @xcite and rna  @xcite as a function of loop length .",
    "the experimental reports , especially on rates of loop formation in polypeptides and proteins , have prompted a number of theoretical studies @xcite that build on the pioneering treatments due to wilemski and fixman @xcite ( wf ) and szabo , schulten , and schulten @xcite ( sss ) .",
    "the wf formalism determines the loop closure time @xmath10 by solving the diffusion equation in the presence of a sink term .",
    "the sink function accounts for the possibility that contact between the ends of a polymer chain occurs whenever they are in proximity .",
    "the time for forming a loop is related to a suitable time integral of the sink - sink correlation function .    in an important paper ,",
    "sss developed a much simpler theory to describe the dependence of the rate of end - to - end contact formation in an ideal chain on the polymer length @xmath2 .",
    "the sss approximation @xcite describes the kinetics of contact formation between the ends of the chain as a diffusion process in an effective potential that is derived from the probability distribution @xmath14 of finding the chain ends with the end - to - end distance @xmath15 .",
    "more recently , such an approach has been adopted to obtain rates of folding of proteins from a free energy surface expressed in terms of an appropriately chosen reaction coordinate  @xcite .",
    "the validity of using the dynamics in a potential of mean force , @xmath16 $ ] , to obtain @xmath12 hinges on local equilibrium being satisfied , i.e. that all processes except the one of interest must occur rapidly . in the case of cyclization kinetics in simple systems ( rouse model or self - avoiding polymer chains ) , the local equilibrium approximation depends minimally on the cyclization time @xmath12 , and the internal chain relaxation time @xmath17 . in the limit @xmath18 , one can envision the motions of the ends as occurring in the effective free energy @xmath19 , because the polymer effectively explores the available volume before the ends meet . by solving the diffusion equation for an ideal chain for which @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , where @xmath4 is the monomer size , subject to absorbing boundary conditions",

    "the simplicity of the sss result , which reduces contact - formation kinetics to merely computing @xmath14 , has resulted in its widespread use to fit experimental data on polypeptide chains  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath2 using the sss theory differs from the wf predictions .",
    "in addition , simulations also show that @xmath12 deviates from the sss prediction @xcite",
    ". the slower dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath2 can be traced to the failure of the assumption that all internal chain motions occur faster than the process of interest .",
    "the interplay between @xmath12 and @xmath17 , which determines the validity of the local equilibrium condition , can be expressed in terms of well known exponents that characterize equilibration and relaxation properties of the polymer chain .",
    "comparison of the conformational space explored by the chain ends and the available volume prior to cyclization  @xcite allows us to express the validity of the local equilibrium in terms of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the spatial dimension , @xmath27 is the des cloizeaux correlation hole exponent that accounts for the behavior of @xmath14 for small @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the dynamical scaling exponent ( @xmath30 ) .",

    "( i ) the theory based on the wf formalism and simulations show the closure time @xmath34 ( @xmath35 for self - avoiding walk and @xmath36 for the rouse chain ) where @xmath37 is a diffusion constant .",
    "we show that the wf result for rouse chains , @xmath38 , can be obtained within the sss framework , provided an effective diffusion constant that accounts for the relaxation dynamics of the ends of the chains is used instead of the monomer diffusion coefficient @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the simplicity of the sss approach can be preserved while recovering the expected scaling result @xcite for the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath2 .",
    "( ii ) the use of the rouse model may be appropriate for polymers or polypeptide chains near @xmath40-conditions . in both good and poor solvents interactions between monomers determine the statics and dynamics of the polymer chains .",
    "the chain will swell in good solvents ( @xmath41 ) whereas in poor solvents , polymers and polypeptide chains adopt compact globular conformations . in these situations ,",
    "interactions between the monomers or the amino acid residues affect @xmath10 .",
    "the monomer - monomer interaction energy scale , @xmath42 , leading to the chain adopting a swollen or globular conformation influences both @xmath43 and the chain relaxation dynamics , and hence affects @xmath10 . because analytic theory in this situation is difficult , we provide simulation results for @xmath10 as a function of @xmath42 and for @xmath44 .",
    "the rouse chain consists of @xmath2 beads , with two successive beads connected by a harmonic potential that keeps them at an average separation @xmath4 , ( the kuhn length ) .",
    "contact formation between the chain ends can occur only if fluctuations result in monomers 1 and @xmath2 being within a capture radius @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the space explored by the chain ends must overlap within the contact volume @xmath46 .",
    "there are three relevant time scales that affect loop closure dynamics ; namely , @xmath47 , the fluctuation time scale of a single monomer , @xmath48 , the relaxation time associated with the fluctuations of the end - to - end distance , and @xmath17 , the relaxation time of the entire chain .",
    "clearly , @xmath49 . because loop formation can occur only if the ends can approach each other , processes that occur on time scale @xmath50 must be coupled to looping dynamics .",
    "we obtain the scaling of @xmath12 with @xmath2 , found using the wf approximation , from the sss formalism using a diffusion constant evaluated on the time scale @xmath48 .",

    "physically , the use of a smaller diffusion constant is needed because contact formation requires fluctuations that bring @xmath82 within the capture radius @xmath3 , a mechanism in which @xmath48 plays a crucial role .    as noted by doi @xcite ,",
    "the relevant time scale for loop closure is not simply the global relaxation time .",

    "it is then of interest to ask whether looping events are preceded by global conformational changes , with a large scale expansion of the polymer that allows the endpoints to search the volume more freely , or if the endpoints search for each other in a highly compact , but more restrictive , ensemble of conformations .",

    "the endpoints in this trajectory , with the small loop closure time @xmath232 , always have a significant number of contacts , and traverse the interior of the globule when searching for each other .",

    "this suggests that , while the chain is in an overall globular conformation ( small , constant @xmath236 ) , the endpoints are mainly found on the exterior of the globule .",
    "this conclusion is again supported by the coordination number , with @xmath237 for significant portions of the simulation . while the endpoints are less restricted by nearby contacts and able to fluctuate more",
    ", the endpoints spend much longer time searching for each other .",
    "thus , it appears that the process of loop formation in poor solvents , where enthalpic effects might be expected to dominate for @xmath216 occurs by a diffusive , reptation - like process .",

    "in contrast for most slow - looping run ( with @xmath240 ) , we observe long stretches of time where both endpoints have a low coordination number ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "these results suggest that motions within the globule are far less restricted than one might have thought , and loop formation will occur faster when the endpoints are within the globule than it would if the endpoints were on the surface .",
    "the longer values of @xmath10 are found if the initial separation of the end points is large , which is more likely if they are on the surface than buried in the interior .",
    "the absence of any change in @xmath214 in both the trajectories , which represent the extreme limits in the first passage time for looping , clearly shows that contact formation in the globular phase is not an activated process .",

    "the results in the previous section suggest a very general mechanism of loop closure for interacting chains .",
    "the process of contact formation for a given trajectory depends on the initial separation @xmath15 , and the dynamics of the approach of the ends .",
    "thus , @xmath12 should be determined by the distribution of @xmath14 ( an equilibrium property ) , and an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath242 ( a dynamic property ) .",
    "we have shown for the rouse model that such a deconvolution into an equilibrium and dynamic part , which is in the spirit of the sss approximation , is accurate in obtaining @xmath12 for a wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath113 .",

    "the decomposition of looping mechanisms into a convolution of equilibrium and dynamical parts explains the large differences in @xmath12 as the solvent quality changes .",

    "the strongly hydrophobic chain is highly compact , with a sharply peaked distribution .",
    "the average end - to - end distance is significantly lower than is the weakly hydrophobic case . while the distribution function is clearly strongly dependent on the interactions , the diffusion coefficient @xmath242 is only weakly dependent on the solvent quality ( fig .",

    "the values of @xmath244 are only reduced by a factor of about 2 between the @xmath245 ( good solvent , with a globally swollen configuration ) and the @xmath246 ( poor solvent , with a globally globular configuration ) on intermediate time scales .",
    "we note , in fact , that the good solvent and @xmath40 solvent cases have virtually identical diffusion coefficients throughout the simulations ( fig [ fig : pdf](b ) ) .",
    "this suggests that the increase in @xmath12 ( fig [ fig : tau_poor ] ) between the rouse chains and the good solvent chains is primarily due to the broadening of the distribution @xmath247 ) , i.e. the significant increase in the average end - to - end distance in the good solvent case , @xmath248 , with @xmath249 .",
    "because of the weak dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the solvent quality , the loop closure time is dominated primarily by the end - to - end distribution function . in other words , the equilibrium distribution function @xmath14 , to a large extent , determines @xmath12 .",
