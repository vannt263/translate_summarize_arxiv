    "transport properties of relativistic plasma are of great interest both experimentally and theoretically . taking the signal of quark gluon plasm(qgp ) for example ,",
    "the so - called strong - coupled matter formed in the relativistic heavy ion collider(rhic ) was well described by an ideal hydrodynamics model in the region of @xmath0 to fit the data of the elliptic flow @xmath1@xcite .",
    "but it is pointed out that the over - prediction in high-@xmath2 region of such model is due to the neglect of dissipation and viscosity@xcite .",
    "thereby the transport coefficients need to be considered .",
    "in addition , the non - ideal fluid properties of viscosity and dissipation may influence some other important equations and quantities such as the equation of state(eos ) , the formation(thermalization ) time and the sound attenuation length etc.@xcite .    from the theoretical points of view",
    ", two formalisms are usually developed to calculate the transport coefficients .",
    "one is kinetic theory which starts from expanding the distribution function near the local equilibrium when dealing with the boltzmann equation .",
    "the transport coefficients , especially the shear viscosity , were discussed by many authors in this formalism@xcite .",
    "the other way of obtaining the transport coefficients is to implement the kubo formulae within the framework of the finite temperature field theory .",
    "the kubo formulae , which work in both weak coupling and strong coupling regime , have been applied for computing the transport coefficients of strong - coupled theory in lattice monte carlo simulations@xcite , and for analytical calculation in scalar theory@xcite and gauge theory@xcite , early with relaxation time approximation and later with ladder diagram resummation and large @xmath3 expansion technique .",
    "however these two approaches are not irrelevant .",
    "their inner relations are attractive theoretically .",
    "some literatures have shown that the kubo formulae with ladder resummation are equivalent to the kinetics theory in scalar field and gauge field@xcite . in principle",
    ", one should resum various diagrams with ladder vertices and effective propagators when evaluating the correlation functions in kubo formulae , which leads to a set of complicated integral equations . in this paper",
    ", we develop another approach , distinguished from the ladder resummation and the naive one - loop calculation which gives an inconvincible result , trying to demonstrate that even at one - loop skeleton diagram level the kubo formula is still consistent qualitatively with kinetics theory if only the proper effective photon and fermion width are chosen as the infrared regulators in which the main physical characters are involved .    in heavy - ion physics , the chemical potential in the central fire ball is not zero thought small compared to the extremely high temperature environment .",
    "and most of the existing publications concentrated only on the high temperature case but neglected the small chemical potential in the heavy ion collision . to involve the chemical potential effect is our main motivation .",
    "it makes sense to introduce a small chemical potential @xmath4 to study that to what extent it can affect the properties of the plasma .",
    "the transport coefficients of qgp at finite density has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the relaxation - time approximation , and early estimated by danielewicz and gyulassy to scale the hydrodynamical equations@xcite .",
    "we estimated the shear viscosity of hot qed plasma at finite temperature and chemical potential , referring to the results in the kinetics framework , since the infrared pinch singularities will appear and long distant interaction should be considered in the transport processes .",
    "the whole context will be arranged as follows : in section 2 , we review the kubo formula relevant to shear viscosity in the finite temperature theory .",
    "the contributions from the photons and the electrons in the qed plasma are studied respectively in section 3 and 4 , in which one can see the transport damping rates play important roles in regulating the pinch singularities .",
    "conclusions and discussions are presented in section 5 .    here",
    "are some notations in this paper : ( a ) the capital letter stands for the four - momentum , @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "( b ) @xmath7 is abbreviated to @xmath8 .",
    "( c ) when we mention hard , it means the momentum is much larger than @xmath9 , or at least at the same order ; soft means much smaller than @xmath10 or at least at the same order .",
    "generally speaking , the longitudinal expansion domains in heavy ion collision , therefore the shear viscosity is more important than the bulk viscosity which is proved much smaller than the former in lattice calculation@xcite . in this paper , we ignore the bulk viscosity and just take the shear viscous one into account .    in a near equilibrium system with linear response theory ,",
    "kubo formula tells us the shear viscosity@xcite is determined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the two - point retarded green function defined as : @xmath13>,\\label{rgf}\\ ] ] and @xmath14 is the spacial part of the dissipative energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spacial energy momentum .",
    "the coefficients @xmath17 is the shear viscosity .",
    "the four - velocity @xmath18 in the local rest frame is @xmath19 .    transforming eq.([rgf ] ) into momentum space , one obtains @xmath20_{q_0=0},\\label{v}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    through the kubo formula we know that the shear viscosity is determined by the two - point retarded green function .",
    "now we start to evaluate it in an explicit dynamics . in the relativistic heavy ion collision",
    ", people are interested in the extremely high temperature environment , therefore one can use hard thermal loop(htl ) approximation theoretically .",
    "we here choose qed as a sample model and calculate the contributions both from the bosons and from the fermions .",
    "the qed lagrangian reads : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electron , anti - electron and photon fields respectively .    with this lagrangian",
    ", one can read the viscous stress tensors in the momentum space , @xmath26 for electrons and @xmath27 for gauge boson with the lorentz gauge condition .    combining eqs.([rgf ] ) , ( [ v ] ) , ( [ vf ] ) and ( [ vb ] ) , with the standard definitions of propagator in quantum field theory and transport vertex defined behind , one can figure out the one - loop skeleton diagrams of the retarded green function presented in fig.1 .",
    "the main difference between the propagators of the normal field and the thermal field rest on the fact that the latter is a @xmath28 matrix due to the doubled hilbert space@xcite .    in a high - temperature environment ,",
    "the loop momenta are hard therefore the mass of fermions can be omitted and bare thermal propagators are sufficient . yet in the straightforward calculation pinch singularities occur when the external four - momentum approaches to zero , which is required by eq.([v ] ) . to avoid such divergences , we must keep the imaginary part of the propagator , namely , the effective damping rate(widths ) , as infrared regulators , which can be obtained analytically at leading - log order .",
    "the diagram of the boson two - point green function is demonstrated in fig.1(a ) , with which one can expressed it as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the thermal gauge boson propagator , and a , b=1 , 2 are the doubled hilbert space indices ; @xmath31 represent the type-1 and type-2 vertices respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath32 is the transport vertex of the photon viscosity .",
    "summing over the lorentz indices and using the reverse relation of keldysh representation@xcite we obtain : @xmath33d_a(k)d_r(k+q),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath34 is the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "@xmath35 is the retarded(advanced ) gauge boson propagator in the feynman gauge with @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the last line of eq.([bs ] ) , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem has been employed : @xmath38sgn(p_0)[d_r(p)-d_a(p)].\\ ] ]    here we encounter the pinch problem of @xmath39 in eq.([bs ] ) when the external momentum @xmath40 approaches to zero which is required by the definition of viscosity .",
    "the physical reason responsible for this divergence is the naive adoption of bare propagators .",
    "therefore the so - called htl resummed propagator developed by pisarski _",
    "et al . _ needs to be considered to involve the medium effect , namely , the scheme of eliminating the pinch is to endow the finite particle life - time or width consistently .",
    "mathematically , we insert a small @xmath41 into the imaginary part of the propagator which physically means the damping rate . the real part of self - energy(thermal mass term ) , which is in @xmath42 order , can be neglected compared with the hard loop momentum .",
    "we drop out @xmath40 in the propagators directly since eq.([v ] ) requires @xmath43 after derivation on @xmath44 , and thus the thermal distribution in eq.([bs ] ) has the form @xmath45+\\cdots\\ ] ] which preserves the first order in @xmath44 .",
    "this procedure can be written manifestly as @xmath46.\\label{delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the photon damping rate is of order @xmath47 , much smaller than the momentum @xmath48 , which implies the width of the photon can be substituted by a delta function approximately in expression ( [ delta ] ) . integrating off the delta function and the azimuth angles in the spherical coordinates ,",
    "the retarded green function becomes @xmath49\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{ph}}.\\label{bosongreen}\\ ] ]    now we are in the position to calculate the photon damping rate consistently at a finite temperature and density .",
    "there is a fact one should notice that the longitudinal contribution is suppressed compared to the transverse one for hard momenta @xcite . to the leading order evaluation , one should only consider the latter .",
    "it was calculated by thoma with vanishing chemical potential @xcite , and we will generalize it to the finite density case .",
    "the photon damping in the plasma owes to two processes , compton scattering and pair production(fig.2 ) .",
    "the two diagrams in the first line of fig.2 stand for compton scattering and the last line is for pair production processes .",
    "the braaten - pisarski method@xcite has been used to calculate the photon damping rate in the qed plasma , where the total effect is divided into two parts by a separating scale .",
    "the soft contribution is obtained by cutting the photon self - energy diagram with the htl resummed fermion propagator(fig.3 ) and the hard contribution can be evaluated most conveniently from the matrix elements .",
    "adding up the two contributions one can cancel the separating scale .",
    "the soft contribution of a real hard photon damping rate follows from the the imaginary part of transverse self - energy in fig.3 , where the blob denotes the full fermion propagator .",
    "the damping rate of a photon is defined as @xmath50 in the case of non - overdamping .",

    ", one can count the power dependency of the coupling constant @xmath127 which makes the viscosity @xmath128 , namely , the reciprocal of quadratic coupling constant , but not quartic as kinetic theory suggusts@xcite .",
    "this disagreement hints us to discover the defects in our previous calculation .",
    "returning back to fig.(1 ) , one would find that only involving effective propagator is not enough , which means the rungs between the two propagators have been omitted . to include such diagrams we must sum up all these ladder diagrams . while that is a rather complex procedure and a set of integral equations is obtained as a result@xcite .",
    "here we do not employ this scheme , instead we replace the fermion damping rate , namely the infrared regulator , with a more physical transport damping rate , which has been applied even in the discussion of classic system and abelian or non - abelian plasma transport coefficients@xcite .    for a rutherford - like scattering in classic plasma , namely , the elastic scattering with the same type and momentum of incoming and outgoing particles , small angle scattering domains in the dynamical cross section .",
    "whereas , as we know , the large angle scattering , which is caused by a series of accumulated multiple small angle scattering in a long distance , is the most effective to the shear viscous process .",
    "thus an additional factor of @xmath129 is multiplied in front of the ordinary cross section@xcite , where @xmath130 is the scattering angle . in this procedure",
    "the so - called transport cross section is defined .",
    "furthermore , when discussing the transport process in qed or qcd plasma with the boltzmann equation in kinetics theory , one will find that the collision term is the convolution integral of scattering amplitudes and their correspondent statistical weights , where if the interaction vertex connects the two particles of the same type , the fluctuation part of the statistic distribution functions will contribute an extra small @xmath131@xcite , @xmath132 ^ 2=[\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\nabla\\chi_{ij}(\\mathbf{p})+\\cdots]^2\\ ] ] which is equivalent to multiply the cross section by the factor of @xmath129 , since @xmath133    weldon investigated the decay rate in thermal field theory@xcite , pointing out that the statistical distributions involving both direct and inverse reactions(detailed balance ) should be considered simultaneously , which naturally demanded for introducing the transport cross section when calculating the fermion damping .",
    "now we are aware of what has been lost in the straightforward computation : that is @xmath131 in eq.([kinetics factor q ] ) , i.e. , the statistical weights do not reflect the detailed balance , which leads to an incorrect result .",
    "therefore the right way to obtain the effective fermion regulator(width ) in transport process is to employ the transport interaction rate and yields , @xmath134 and @xmath135.\\ ] ]    changing integration variables from @xmath136 to @xmath137 , we can evaluate the integral over @xmath123 analytically and find out the logarithmic dependence on the integral limits .",
    "this is again the category which can be treated by employing the braaten - pisarski method for the consistent leading order quantities , i.e. employing a separating scale @xmath78 to divide the integral into a soft contribution and a hard contribution , then adding the two contributions which leads to the cancellation of @xmath78 .",
    "one would notice in the previous calculation on the photon damping rate that the coefficients in front of the log - terms in the soft and hard contributions are identical so as to guarantee the separating scale to be cancelled .",
    "thereby we can play a little trick to obtain the leading - log result by just calculating the soft contributions and replacing the separating scale with the upper @xmath9 , ignoring the constant factor added to the logarithm term which is less important in the weak coupling limit . completing the integral over @xmath123",
    "we obtain , the fermion lines in figure 4 should be hard and the pauli blocking has tiny effect on the final result .",
    "compared with the contribution from bose - einstein distribution function of photon , the chemical potential in the fermi - dirac distribution can be neglected . as to the density effect in the full photon propagator",
    ", the small chemical potential just modifies the constant in the logarithm but preserves the order in @xmath138 .",
    "qualitatively one can adopt this result . ] @xmath139 with @xmath140 in central mass system .    combining ( [ fs2 ] ) with ( [ dr ] ) and noticing that @xmath141 , one adopts a delta function as approximation and finds : @xmath142[\\delta(k_0-k)+\\delta(k_0+k))].\\ ] ] integrating over @xmath143 and then expanding the @xmath144 in terms of small @xmath44 , ignoring the terms without @xmath44(because eq .",

    "the leading - log shear viscous coefficient contributed by the fermions is : @xmath148    on the contrary , if an interaction vertex connects the two particles of different types , like compton scattering or pair production we have discussed in the previous section , no kinetics factor @xmath131 will be isolated from the statistical weight , i.e. , @xmath129 will not appear in the photon width expression@xcite .",
    "that is why we got the right dependence of the coupling constant by just adopting the ordinary photon damping rate as the infrared regulator in the photon contribution .",
    "one thing we should mention is when this method is generated to qcd case , bosons transport damping rate should be taken into account due to the self - coupling of gluon field , which is different with the photon behavior .",
    "adding up the contributions from both the electron and photon sectors , the shear viscous coefficient of qed plasma is obtained , @xmath149 one may find that the density - relevant part of viscosity coming from the photons is negative but the one from electrons is positive .",
    "they compete with each other and leave a positive contribution of chemical potential , which demonstrates an enhancement effect of density .",
    "the above result is consistent , in the order accuracy of coupling constant , but differing by a factor with those obtained in kinetic theory at the finite density@xcite and the pure temperature case@xcite when @xmath150 goes to zero .",
    "what we mean consistency here is just at the qualitative level .",
    "more accurate effect like ladder resummation , in which none damping rate should be replaced by the transport one since it is self - consistently including the main characters of the transport processes , should be involved in the calculation .",
    "the one - loop approximation may partly account for the discrepancy of the factors scaled by the logarithms .    from the proceeding analysis",
    "we can conclude that the estimation of the shear viscosity of qed plasma calculated at one - loop skeleton diagram level by choosing proper fermion width in the framework of the finite temperature field theory , is economical and reliable .",
    "other transport coefficients of the relativistic plasma at finite temperature and density could be discussed similarly .",
    "using this method helps us to handle the pinch singularity easily if the transport hard fermion and boson damping rates are known . for non - abelian gauge qcd plasma , we can follow the similar steps in this paper with qed case to estimate the transport coefficients at one - loop skeleton diagram level by using the transport damping rates for both gluon and quark sectors.nevertheless , we may point out that some further improvements could be introduced to obtain more precise results such as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal(lpm ) effects due to the interference of multiple scattering process@xcite for the complete leading - order contribution .",

    "<S> within the framework of finite temperature field theory this paper discusses the shear viscosity of hot qed plasma through kubo formula at one - loop skeleton diagram level with a finite chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the effective widths(damping rates ) are introduced to regulate the pinch singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the finite chemical potential , which enhances the contributions to the shear viscosity from the electrons while suppresses those from the photons , finally gives a positive contribution compared to the pure temperature environment . </S>",
    "<S> the result agrees with that from the kinetics theory qualitatively . </S>"
