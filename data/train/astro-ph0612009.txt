    "we have mapped the distribution and kinematics of the gas and stars in 9 nearby agn using adaptive optics to reach high spatial resolution at near infrared wavelengths .",
    "the agn are mostly seyfert  1s , of which 2 are ulirgs and 1 a qso .",
    "the primary goals of the project are to : ( i ) determine the extent and history of star formation , and its relation to the agn and torus ; ( ii ) measure the properties of the molecular gas , and understand its relation to the torus ; ( iii ) derive black hole masses from spatially resolved stellar kinematics .",
    "detailed studies of several individual objects are already published : mkn231 @xcite ; ngc7469 @xcite ; circinus @xcite ; ngc3227 @xcite .",
    "additionally , we are analysing the general properties of the star formation ( davies et al .",
    ", in prep ) and the molecular gas ( hicks et al . in prep ) . in this contribution",
    ", we highlight 2 pertinent features of the h@xmath1 in ngc1068 and summarise our results about nuclear star formation .",
    "ngc1068 is a prototypical seyfert  2 galaxy and one of the cornerstones of agn unification schemes . yet , despite its proximity to us ( 14.4mpc , 1@xmath2pc ) , many aspects of its nuclear region remain poorly understood . in particular , it is now apparent from our sinfoni h@xmath1 10s(1 ) data that simple warped disk models of the molecular gas @xcite can not account for the fantastic variety and detail in the morphological and kinematical structure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "here we focus on the two aspects apparent in fig .",
    "[ dav : fig : n1068 ] , which are discussed in more detail by mueller snchez et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "radio continuum imaging at 5ghz with a resolution of 0.065revealed a number of structures along the inner part of the radio jet @xcite .",
    "associating component s1 with the inner edge of the torus , these authors developed a scenario in which component c arises from a shock interaction between the jet and a dense molecular cloud . supporting",
    "this hypothesis was the bend in the radio jet , the slightly flatter spectral index , and the presence of maser emission .",
    "the left - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ dav : fig : n1068 ] shows that component c does in fact coincide spatially with a finger of 1 - 0s(1 ) emission which traces h@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath3 levels are thermalised , indicating that the gas is likely to be rather dense ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) .",
    "thus the sinfoni data provide direct evidence for the molecular cloud and hence strongly support the jet - cloud interaction hypothesis .",
    "interestingly , the jet component ne occurs where the jet crosses an arc of brighter 1 - 0s(1 ) emission , suggesting that it may also result from an interaction between the jet and molecular gas although perhaps not in a head - on collision as appears to be the case at component c.      the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ dav : fig : n1068 ] reveals that close around the position of the near infrared non - stellar continuum , which indicates the location of the agn , we have detected an extended clump of 1 - 0s(1 ) .",
    "since the 1 - 0s(1 ) directly traces h@xmath1 , we associate this clump with the molecular material responsible for obscuring the agn .",
    "there are 2 crucial pieces of evidence to support this : ( i ) the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission is oriented at a position angle of @xmath6 , consistent with that of the line of maser spots @xcite , the 20mas scale radio continuum in the nuclear component s1 @xcite , and the 300k dust emission ( jaffe , this proceedings ) ; ( ii ) the size scale is remarkably similar to those of static torus models , in particular the more realistic clumpy model of @xcite , for which a size of @xmath7pc ( diameter ) is predicted for the h@xmath1 distribution ( hnig , this proceedings ) .",
    "this then appears to be the first direct image of the torus in ngc1068 .",
    "in evolving stellar populations , once late type stars appear , the equivalent widths of the co2 - 0 2.29@xmath8 m and co6 - 3 1.62@xmath8 m bandheads stay approximately independent of age .",
    "thus , while these features can say nothing about the stellar population itself , they facilitate the important step of separating the stellar continuum from the non - stellar continuum associated with the agn .",
    "they also enable one to measure the kinematics of the stars  by convolving a suitable stellar template with a broadening function , which is optimised so as to minimise the difference between the galaxy spectrum and the convolution product . without any additional modelling of the stellar age or history",
    ", these simple measures already yield significant insights into the nuclear stellar population .",
    "ngc1068 and ngc1097 show the clearest evidence for distinct nuclear stellar populations from both the surface brightness profile and the kinematics . at larger radii ( i.e. out to a few arcsec )",
    ", the surface brightness profile can be well fit by a single @xmath9 profile .",
    "but when this is convolved with the psf and extrapolated inwards , one finds excess stellar continuum at radii less than 0.51 .",
    "similarly , at larger radii , the velocity dispersion is 120150kms@xmath10 ; but as one approaches the nucleus it decreases , reaching 70100kms@xmath10 at the centre .",
    "sigma - drops have been seen in several spiral galaxies , and are interpreted as arising from gas accretion into the central regions followed by star formation @xcite . because the gas is dynamically cool , so will the newly formed stars be : in contrast to the spheroidal bulge , their distribution will be rather disky .",
    "we have now spatially resolved 2 of these sigma - drops , and shown that they are associated with excess stellar continuum  strong evidence in favour of their being a distinct dynamically cool stellar population . in these specific cases ,",
    "we are able to trace this population to radii of @xmath11pc , and estimate a mass of order @xmath12m@xmath13 . under the assumption that they are self - gravitating",
    ", this implies a vertical scale height of 510pc suggesting that these nuclear disks are in fact relatively thick and that random motions still provide significant support .      making a rough estimate of the bolometric luminosity l@xmath14 from the k - band luminosity l@xmath15 is possible without knowing in detail the star formation history",
    "this is because l@xmath14/l@xmath16 to within a factor 3 ( for ages exceeding 10myr ) .",
    "detailed modelling of the stellar populations has in fact been performed for the agn listed in section  [ dav : sec : intro ] more generally , making careful corrections for contributions from the agn and its associated phenomena , it is possible to constrain the age using the br@xmath17 flux , the supernova rate ( estimated from radio continuum measurements in the literature ) , the k - band stellar luminosity , and the dynamical mass . doing so , we find for our sample of agn characteristic ages in the range 10300myr .",
    "looking at how l@xmath14 varies as a function of radius , we find that our sample of agn all follow a similar trend which we are able to trace from scales of 1kpc down to only a few parsecs .",
    "the surface brightness increases at smaller radii , approaching @xmath18l@xmath13kpc@xmath19 on scales of a few parsec .",
    "this is the surface brightness predicted by models of optically thick star forming disks in ulirgs by @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in ulirgs it extends over a size scale of 1kpc ; in these agn the most intense starburst is confined to the central few parsec .",
    "@xcite argued that ulirgs are essentially eddington limited starbursts .",
    "the reason is that their bolometric luminosity per unit mass is similar to the 500l@xmath13/m@xmath13 which @xcite argued is sufficient for radiation pressure to halt further accretion . within the central few tens of parsecs ,",
    "the agn we have observed are an order of magnitude below this limit .",
    "intriguingly , the typically low br@xmath17 fluxes imply that although the star formation is recent , it is no longer active .",
    "this is important because short - lived starbursts fade very quickly : the bolometric luminosity l@xmath14 of a burst which is active for a timescale of 10myr will have decreased by more than an order of magnitude at an age of 100myr .",
    "thus in the recent past , these nuclear stellar populations could easily have been 10 times more luminous than at present  in which case they would have been radiating at the eddington limit for starbursts .",
    "our analysis indicates that intense but short - lived starbursts are likely to be common close around agn",
    ". it may be that whether one is able to detect the signature of such starbursts in agn depends on the time - scales and size - scales which are being probed by the observations ."
