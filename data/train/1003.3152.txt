    "soft deformable objects such as liquid droplets  @xcite , lipid vesicles  @xcite , red blood cells ( rbcs )  @xcite , and synthetic capsules  @xcite exhibit rich behaviors in flows . in recent years , they have received growing attention experimentally , theoretically , and numerically .",
    "these objects are filled with liquids and have a constant internal volume @xmath5 .",
    "the lipid vesicles , rbcs , and synthetic capsules are wrapped by lipid or polymer membranes and resist breaking up under much larger shear than liquid droplets .",
    "the variation of material properties of these objects can lead to different dynamic modes with morphological changes .",
    "since microcapsules can carry substances and control their release , they are widely used in various fields including food , printing inks , pharmaceutics ( drug carrier for drug delivery system ) , agrochemicals , and cosmetics .",
    "various kinds of microcapsules are synthesized with different sizes and membrane thicknesses @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the deformability of microcapsules can be varied widely by controlling the membrane elastic properties and capsule shapes . when the membrane is made of linear - elastic material , two - dimensional young s modulus @xmath7 and the bending modulus @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two - dimensional shear and area compression moduli , respectively , with three - dimensional young s modulus @xmath11 and poisson ratio @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus , thicker membranes become more difficult to bend than to stretch ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "rbcs have a composite membrane made of lipid membrane and attached spectrin network .",
    "the lipid membrane is in a fluid phase and is almost incompressible .",
    "the spectrin network adds shear elasticity to the membrane .",
    "the bending and shear elasticities of rbcs are estimated by micropipette aspiration @xcite and optical tweezers experiments @xcite : @xmath14j and @xmath15n / m .",
    "the relative importance of bending and shear elasticities is determined by the dimensionless fppl - von krmn number @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean radius of capsules or cells @xcite .",
    "the buckling transition of capsules from spherical to icosahedral shape occurs at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "capsules with a linear elastic membrane have large values of @xmath19 because @xmath20 .",
    "capsules with a composite membrane can also have small @xmath21 . in this paper , we investigate microcapsules with wide ranges of @xmath21 .    recently , the dynamics of lipid vesicles in steady shear flow was intensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "a lipid vesicle can be considered as a microcapsule in the small limit of the shear modulus @xmath22 .",
    "an isolated fluid vesicle exhibits three types of dynamic modes in a steady shear flow , with flow velocity @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a unit vector in the flow direction .",
    "when the viscosity of internal fluid @xmath3 and membrane viscosity @xmath25 are low , the membrane exhibit a tank - treading ( tt ) rotation with a stationary shape and a constant inclination angle @xmath26 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : cart](b ) ] . at high",
    "@xmath3 or @xmath25 , the vesicle exhibit a tumbling ( tb ) motion , where @xmath1 rotates [ see fig . [",
    "fig : cart](c ) ] . around the tt - tb transition viscosity with high shear rate @xmath4 , a swinging ( sw ) motion appears @xcite , where @xmath1 and the vesicle shape oscillate [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : cart](d ) ] .",
    "this motion is also called trembling @xcite or vacillating - breathing @xcite .",
    "these three types of motion can be understood by the perturbation theories for quasi - spherical vesicles @xcite or a generalized keller - skalak ( ks ) theory for deformable ellipsoidal vesicles @xcite .",
    "experimentally , synthetic capsules and rbcs show the oscillation ( swinging ) of their lengths and @xmath1 @xcite during tt motion and rbcs also transit from tb to tt with increasing @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "recently , this dynamics was explained by the ks theory with the addition of an energy barrier for the tt rotation caused by the membrane shear elasticity  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we phenomenologically extended this theory  @xcite to include the shape deformation of rbcs  @xcite .",
    "fix - shaped and deformable rbcs give very similar phase behavior .",
    "at low @xmath4 , rbcs show tb ( @xmath1 ) rotation without tt ( @xmath2 ) membrane rotation . in the middle ranges of shear rate @xmath4 ,",
    "synchronized phases of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 rotations with integer ratios of the rotation frequencies as well as intermittent rotations  @xcite appear  @xcite .",
    "the tt - tb transition was also obtained by recent simulations of microcapsules  @xcite .",
    "however , the above intermediate phase ( synchronized or intermittent rotations ) was not observed in their simulations .",
    "_ contested that intermittent rotation is an artifact of the theoretical model  @xcite . as we describe below , the disappearance of the intermediate phase is found to be caused by low bending elasticity in their simulations . in this paper",
    ", we systematically investigate the dynamics of microcapsules in steady shear flow , and show that their phase behaviors are qualitatively changed from the bending - elasticity dominant condition to the shear - elasticity dominant condition .",
    "note that some confusion is caused by the different definitions of a tumbling state . for fluid vesicles",
    ", tumbling typically means the rotation of inclination angle accompanied by the rotation of the phase angle @xmath2 . on the other hand , for rbcs and capsules ,",
