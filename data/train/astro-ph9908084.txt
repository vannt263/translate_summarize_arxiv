    "photoionization of primordial gas is well known to have great impacts on galaxy formation and the thermal history of the universe .",
    "the observations of the qso absorption spectra ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) imply that the intergalactic gas has been highly ionized before redshift @xmath4 . in fact , the existence of an intense ultraviolet ( uv ) background radiation that can photoionize the universe is inferred from the proximity effect of ly@xmath5 forest at @xmath6 ( e.g. baljtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ; bechtold 1994 ; giallongo et al .",
    "the origin of the uv background radiation could be attributed to the emission from qso s and/or young galaxies formed at high redshifts ( e.g. couchman 1985 ; miralda - escude & ostriker 1990 ; fukugita & kawasaki 1994 ) .    the uv background radiation , once produced , largely affects the subsequent formation of structures . in particular , the formation of low - mass objects is suppressed via photoionization and heating associated with it ( umemura & ikeuchi 1985 ; ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ; couchman & rees 1986 ; ikeuchi , murakami & rees 1988 , 1989 ; efstathiou 1992 ; babul & rees 1992 ; chiba & nath 1994 ; babul & ferguson 1996 ; okoshi & ikeuchi 1996 ; haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ; kepner , babul & spergel 1997 , among others ) .",
    "such suppression may partly resolve some of the shortcomings of the hierarchical models of structure formation , such as an excess number of faint galaxies predicted than actually observed ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ) . in view of this",
    ", several authors have simulated the thermal and dynamical evolution of the intergalactic medium under the uv background ( umemura & ikeuchi 1984 ; bond , szalay & silk 1988 ; murakami & ikeuchi 1990 , 1993 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; quinn , katz & efstathiou 1996 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; weinberg , hernquist & katz 1997 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) . for instance , thoul & weinberg ( 1996 ) concluded that the objects with circular velocities @xmath7 km s@xmath1 are prevented from collapsing at @xmath8 .",
    "these previous studies , however , were based upon the assumption that the medium is optically thin against the ionizing photons .",
    "gas clouds in reality become optically thick in the course of contraction and it is by no means trivial how much the cloud evolution is altered when the radiative transfer of ionizing photons is incorporated . in addition , only the limited range of collapse redshift has been explored previously . as the mean density of the universe depends strongly on redshift in proportion to @xmath9 , the effects of the uv background radiation should also vary , with an increasing importance of the radiative transfer at higher redshifts .",
    "the possible evolution of the uv background intensity may have further impacts on the cloud dynamics at different redshifts .    in this paper , we study the effects of the uv background radiation on the dynamical evolution of primordial clouds , by means of one - dimensional , spherically symmetric hydrodynamical simulations , incorporating the radiative transfer of the ionizing photons .",
    "we use analytical approximations of the photoionization coefficients and heating rates derived in appendix , which take explicit account of the frequency / direction - dependent radiative transfer due to the absorption by hi , hei and heii .",
    "they are simply expressed as a function of column densities of each species from the cloud boundary and are applicable to the medium with an arbitrary density profile . by using these analytical formulae ,",
    "we have achieved a significant reduction of the computational time and are thus able to explore broad ranges in cloud mass scale , collapse redshift , and parameters of the external uv field .",
    "the results are compared quantitatively with those of optically thin calculations .",
    "based on the results of numerical simulations , we further predict the global production rate of cooled gas in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe and discuss its implications on galaxy formation and cosmic star formation history .",
    "we also discuss the imprints of the uv background on the quasar absorption lines , such as the observability of the helium ly@xmath5 forests , which can be tested by future observations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe the numerical model used in this paper . ",
    "3 presents the results of our simulation and  4 is devoted to the discussion . finally ",
    "4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "wherever necessary , the following cosmological parameters are assumed for definiteness ; the density parameter @xmath10 , the hubble constant @xmath11 , the baryon density parameter @xmath12 , and the amplitude of the density fluctuations @xmath13 .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is chosen to match the observed local abundance of galaxy clusters ( e.g. viana & liddle 1996 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; kitayama & suto 1997 ) .",
    "we simulate the dynamics of a spherically symmetric bound system exposed to the diffuse uv background radiation .",
    "the system is a mixture of baryonic gas and collisionless dark matter , with the mass ratio of @xmath15 .",
    "the evolution of these components is described by the following equations : @xmath16 and @xmath17 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , are the radius , mass , density , pressure , temperature , internal energy per unit mass , and mean molecular weight in units of the proton mass @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is the total mass interior to @xmath18 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the heating and cooling rates per unit volume , @xmath29 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "wherever necessary , the subscripts @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote baryon and dark matter , respectively",
    ". the adiabatic index is fixed at @xmath33 throughout the paper .",
    "the above equations are solved using the second - order - accurate lagrangian finite - difference scheme described in bowers & wilson ( 1991 ) and thoul & weinberg ( 1995 ) .",
    "the shocks are treated with the artificial viscosity technique ( richtmyer & morton 1967 ; umemura 1993 ) .",
    "the shells are binned equally in mass and their numbers are @xmath34 for baryonic gas and @xmath35 for dark matter .",
    "we have performed runs with @xmath36 and @xmath37 and confirmed that our results are robust against the changes in the resolution .",
    "we have also checked that our code reproduces accurately the similarity solutions for the adiabatic accretion of collisional gas and for the pressure - less collapse onto a black hole ( bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "the total energy of the system is conserved by better than a few percent in any runs reported in this paper .",
    "the baryonic gas is assumed to have the primordial composition with hydrogen and helium mass fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . at each time - step , starting out from the cloud boundary into the interior , we successively solve for the ionization equilibrium among photoionization , collisional ionization and recombination , together with the penetration of the external uv field , as described in detail later in this section .",
    "we then compute the heating / cooling rates due to photoionization , collisional ionization / excitation , recombination , thermal bremsstrahlung , and compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use the rates and coefficients summarized in fukugita & kawasaki ( 1994 ) , which corrects a few typos in cen ( 1992 ) .    the external uv field is taken to be isotropic and have the power - law spectrum : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the intensity ( in proper coordinates ) at the lyman limit of hydrogen ( @xmath42ev ) and @xmath5 is the spectral index .",
    "observations of the proximity effect in the ly@xmath5 forest suggest @xmath43 at @xmath44 ( baljtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ; giallongo et al .",
    "1996 ; cooke , espey & carswell 1997 ; savaglio et al .",
    "1997 ) , but its value is still highly uncertain at other redshifts .",
    "theoretical predictions of the value of @xmath45 needed to reionize the universe at high redshifts range from @xmath46 to even @xmath47 ( e.g. fukugita & kawasaki 1994 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) .",
    "the predicted epoch at which reionization occurs also has a large uncertainty between @xmath48 and 6 . in the present paper ,",
    "unless otherwise stated explicitly , we fix the onset of the uv background at @xmath49 , and consider the following four cases at @xmath50 :    1 .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 , 2 .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath52 , 3 .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath54 , 4 .",
    "evolving @xmath45 and @xmath52 , where + @xmath55    the values @xmath52 and @xmath56 are chosen to mimic the spectra of quasars and massive stars , respectively . by the above form of the uv evolution ( eq.[[eq : uvevol ] ] ) , we attempt to study the effects of a late reionization and a decline of the uv intensity at low redshift .",
    "the incident uv spectrum is modified due to the radiative transfer as it penetrates into the gas cloud . in the present paper ,",
    "we explicitly take account of the frequency / direction - dependent absorption by hi , hei , and heii , using equations ( [ eq : coeff4 ] ) and ( [ eq : rate4 ] ) in appendix .",
    "having performed the frequency and angular integrations of the transfer equation neglecting the emission term , the analytical formulae are obtained for the photoionization coefficients and heating rates in the plane - parallel slab .",
    "they are simply expressed as a function of column densities of individual species measured from the boundary , and lead to a significant reduction in the computational time . by means of these formulae ,",
    "we solve simultaneously for the ionization equilibrium in each gas shell and the uv radiation field processed between the outer boundary and that shell .",
    "the ionization state of the gas and the radiation field are computed iteratively until the abundances of hi , hei and heii all converge to the precision better than 1% .",
    "note that the above treatment of the radiative transfer systematically overestimates the effect of absorption in the following respects ; 1 ) since the solution of the transfer equation in the plane - parallel geometry is applied to a spherical cloud , the photon path lengths from the outer boundary are overestimated , 2 ) at each radial point , ionizing photons coming from the inner @xmath57 steradian of the cloud is ignored , and 3 ) the emission ( or scatter ) of incident photons is neglected .",
    "it should thus provide a conservative limit in which an external uv field is maximally weakened and has the minimal effects on cloud evolution .",
    "this is in fact complementary to a conventional approximation of the optically thin medium ( e.g. thoul & weinberg 1996 ) , in which the external uv field is likely to have the maximal effects on the cloud dynamics . in what follows , therefore",
    ", we examine both of these limiting cases and perform quantitative comparisons between them . in so doing ,",
    "we hope to bracket the true answer , which is still very difficult to solve in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "the approximation of the ionization equilibrium is correct if the recombination time - scale @xmath58 is shorter than the dynamical time - scale @xmath59 .",
    "assuming a high degree of ionization , this yields the following condition for the electron density @xmath60 ( e.g. vedel , hellsten & sommer - larsen 1994 ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and we have adopted @xmath63 using the recombination rate for hydrogen @xmath64 given in equation ( [ eq : hrec ] ) .",
    "the above condition is satisfied in most situations considered in this paper except at the outer envelopes of clouds at low redshifts .",
    "for example , in a cloud collapsing at @xmath65 , typically the out - most @xmath66 of the gas has the density below the above value at @xmath67 ( see  [ sec : init ] for the definition of the collapse epoch ) . for these shells , the assumption of the ionization equilibrium will result in overestimating the fractions of neutral species and hence in overestimating the effect of absorption even further . in practice , however , the physical abundances of neutral species in these shells are negligibly small .",
    "thus the approximation of the ionization equilibrium is well justified in the present analysis .",
    "we start the simulations when the overdensity of a cloud is still in the linear regime .",
    "the initial overdensity profile is assumed to have the form of a single spherical fourier mode for both baryon and dark matter components : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the comoving wavenumber , and @xmath70 is the central overdensity . throughout the paper , we fix @xmath71 .",
    "assuming that the initial perturbation is dominated by the growing mode , the initial velocity profile is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the hubble parameter at the initial epoch , and @xmath74 is the volume averaged overdensity within radius @xmath18 .",
    "the outer boundary is taken at the first minimum of @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 , at which @xmath74 vanishes and the shell initially expands at the speed @xmath77 . as in haiman , thoul & loeb ( 1996 ) , we define the baryonic mass enclosed within this radius as the bound mass @xmath78 , and that enclosed within the first zero of @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath79 , as the cloud mass @xmath80 . these masses are related to each other via @xmath81 m_{\\rm bound } = 0.363 m_{\\rm bound}$ ] .",
    "having fixed the initial density profile , we vary the initial redshift @xmath82 and the cloud mass @xmath80 to simulate different collapse epochs and mass scales , i.e. , circular velocities or virial temperatures .",
    "we define the central collapse redshift @xmath83 and the cloud collapse redshift @xmath84 respectively as the epochs at which the inner - most gas shell and the shell enclosing @xmath80 would collapse to the center in the absence of thermal pressure .",
    "the circular velocity @xmath85 and the virial temperature @xmath86 of the cloud are defined using @xmath80 and @xmath84 as @xmath87 unless otherwise stated explicitly , we study three combinations of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 listed in table [ tab : zi ] . in this table , we also list the turn - around redshifts corresponding to @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively . in the low - redshift collapse",
    ", the gas is exposed to the uv background radiation from the linear regime . in the middle - redshift collapse ,",
    "the cloud center is close to turn - around at the onset of the uv radiation @xmath90 . in the high - redshift collapse ,",
    "the cloud center has already collapsed prior to @xmath91 .    at an initial epoch ,",
    "the gas is assumed to have the uniform temperature given by @xmath92 taking account of the fact that the matter is tightly coupled to the cosmic microwave background at @xmath93 ( e.g. anninos & norman 1994 ; chieze , teyssier & alimi 1997 ) .",
    "if the gas is able to lose sufficient energy by radiative cooling , it falls towards the center nearly at the free - fall rate .",
    "as the density increases near the center , the cooling time - scale @xmath94 and the dynamical time - scale @xmath95 become extremely small , and infinitely large number of time - steps are required in the simulation . in order to avoid this , we introduce the following criteria . if a gas shell reaches below some minimum radius @xmath96 _ and _ satisfy @xmath97 , then we regard it as having cooled and collapsed ; we move the shell to the center and ignore in the rest of the simulation , except in the calculation of the gravitational force .",
    "when dropping a shell to the center , we assume that the next shell expands inward adiabatically to cover the volume of the dropped shell .",
    "the evolution of each shell is traced until both of the above criteria are fulfilled .",
    "we adopt as @xmath98 the radius at which the system attains rotational support ( e.g. padmanabham 1993 ) : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the turn - around radius of the gas shell , and @xmath101 is the dimensionless spin parameter attained by turn - around .",
    "we fix @xmath102 based on the results of the numerical simulations ( efstathiou & jones 1979 ; barns & efstathiou 1987 ; warren et al .",
    "equation ( [ eq : barrier ] ) also gives the scale under which the assumption of spherical symmetry breaks down . the baryon mass that has collapsed to the center is denoted by @xmath103 .",
    "the dynamical time - scale also becomes very small when collisionless dark matter shells approach the center .",
    "we therefore rebounce the dark matter shells near the center ( spitzer & hart 1971 ; gott 1975 ) .",
    "as noted by thoul & weinberg ( 1995 ) , it is desirable to choose the rebouncing radius @xmath104 that is small enough not to alter the evolution of gas shells , but not too small to degrade energy conservation . in order to achieve these",
    ", we set @xmath104 equal to @xmath96 of a gas shell that encloses @xmath105 depending on a run . throughout each run , @xmath104 is fixed at this value .    at the outer boundary",
    ", we adopt the free boundary condition , i.e. the pressure outside the cloud @xmath106 is zero .",
    "we have also performed runs with a mirror boundary condition ( @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the pressure of the outermost gas shell ) and confirmed that our results remain essentially invariant .",
    "figure [ fig : r_z1 ] illustrates the trajectories of gas shell radii in the low - redshift collapse ( @xmath109 ) for a cloud with @xmath110 km s@xmath1 ( @xmath111 ) . in the absence of the uv background , the gas shells initially comoving with the hubble expansion will eventually turn around due to gravity and start to contract . as the virial temperature of the cloud is @xmath112 k",
    ", the gas can lose energy efficiently by radiative cooling and collapse towards the center .",
    "if the uv background radiation is present , on the contrary , the evolution of the cloud is significantly altered .",
    "figure [ fig : r_z1 ] ( a ) shows that the cloud is prohibited to collapse completely under a constant uv with @xmath113 and @xmath52 .",
    "once , however , the uv amplitude is reduced to @xmath114 and the absorption is taken into account , the inner part of the cloud may start to collapse ( fig .  [",
    "fig : r_z1]b ) .",
    "alternatively , a softer spectrum @xmath54 enables larger number of shells to collapse by @xmath115 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_z1]c ) .",
    "the cloud collapse is also promoted if the uv background radiation evolves according to equation ( [ eq : uvevol ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_z1]d ) .    in order to study the above mentioned features in more detail , we plot in figure [ fig : txx_z1 ] the evolution of the temperature @xmath22 , hi fraction @xmath116 , hi column density measured from the outer boundary @xmath117 , and heii fraction @xmath118 in the runs shown in figure [ fig : r_z1 ] . for @xmath113 and @xmath52 , temperature rises to @xmath119 k and all the gas is photoionized almost instantaneously at the onset of the uv background @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txx_z1]a ) . at this epoch ,",
    "the cloud density is still almost equal to the mean of the universe ( @xmath120 @xmath121 ) and the external uv field can penetrate into the cloud center , even if the absorption is considered .",
    "the thermal pressure of the heated gas takes over the gravity and the cloud keeps expanding",
    ".    for a smaller uv amplitude @xmath114 , figure [ fig : txx_z1](b ) shows that the cloud evolves very differently with / without the absorption . if the absorption is considered , the central part of the cloud is not ionized instantaneously , but stays neutral until the gas density decreases significantly due to expansion .",
    "it is noticeable that the temperature still rises almost instantaneously to @xmath122 k. this is because the time - scale for heating is much shorter than that for ionization ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "one can roughly estimate the ratio of these time - scales in the case of @xmath52 as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the hi optical depth at the lyman limit @xmath125 , and @xmath126 and @xmath127 are photoionization coefficient and heating rate derived for the pure hydrogen gas in appendix ( eqs  [ [ eq : coeff6]][[eq : rate7 ] ] ) . at @xmath91 , the hi column density at the center is @xmath128 @xmath129 in figure [ fig : txx_z1](b ) , which gives the optical depth of @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the above equation . for a softer spectrum ,",
    "this ratio becomes larger and the heating becomes relatively slower as illustrated in figure [ fig : txx_z1](c ) . in this case , the pressure gradient between the cold neutral center of the cloud and the hot ionized envelope causes to push the gas slightly inward near the cloud center at @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_z1 ] c ) .",
    "figure [ fig : txx_z1](b ) further indicates that as the gravity overcomes the pressure support , the gas shells can turn around and the density starts to rise again .",
    "the gas is first heated by shock and adiabatic compression , but it will start to lose energy and shrink to the center once the radiative cooling becomes efficient .",
    "consequently the neutral core is formed at the center .",
    "the absorption of the external uv field promotes the cloud collapse and the formation of the neutral core , by both reducing the number of photoionized ions and lowering the heating rate .",
    "the cloud evolution is very sensitive to the spectral index of the uv background . for a softer spectrum @xmath54 , there are smaller numbers of high energy photons , and hence larger numbers of heii , than for @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txx_z1]c )",
    ". the larger number of shells are thus able to collapse within a given time for @xmath54 .",
    "if the uv background evolves according to equation ( [ eq : uvevol ] ) , the gas in the cloud is ionized gradually as in figure [ fig : txx_z1](d ) .",
    "as the uv intensity drops at @xmath133 , the neutral fraction starts to rise again and the inner shells start to collapse to the center .",
    "figure [ fig : prof ] shows the radial profiles at @xmath115 in some of the runs discussed above .",
    "the shock front ( if exists ) is at @xmath134 kpc .",
    "the density profile inside the shock front agrees well with the self - similar solution @xmath135 ( bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "the central part of the cloud is self - shielded against the external uv photons and the gas becomes neutral . in the case of @xmath136 with absorption , the simulated profiles of @xmath137 and @xmath117 roughly agree with an analytical estimation for the pure hydrogen gas presented in appendix .",
    "for instance , inserting into equation ( [ eq : depth2 ] ) the values read off from the figure at @xmath138 kpc , ( @xmath139@xmath129 , @xmath119k , and @xmath140 ) , we obtain @xmath141 , i.e. @xmath142@xmath129 , in good accordance with figure [ fig : prof](c ) . on the contrary ,",
    "such an estimation breaks down for the softer spectrum ( @xmath54 ) because of the larger abundances of hei and heii .",
    "the effects of the uv background radiation become less significant as the cloud mass increases .",
    "figure [ fig : r_z1b](a ) shows that the gas collapse is still delayed by the uv radiation for a cloud with @xmath143 km s@xmath1 ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 k ) .",
    "the evolution , however , is only slightly altered for a larger cloud with @xmath146 km s@xmath1 ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 k ) .",
    "the effects of absorption , compared to the optically thin case , also become insignificant at this mass scale as the collisional ionization dominates the photoionization .",
    "figures [ fig : r_z2 ] and [ fig : txx_z2 ] illustrate the trajectories of gas shells in the middle - redshift collapse ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "since the density of a cloud is higher than the low - redshift collapses discussed above , the larger amount of gas is able to collapse for a given circular velocity @xmath150 km s@xmath1 . at the onset of the uv background @xmath90",
    ", the cloud center is about to turn around , and the density is @xmath151 @xmath121 , roughly a factor of 5 larger than the mean density of the universe . at this density ,",
    "the inner part of the cloud can be kept self - shielded against ionizing photons until it collapses if the absorption is considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txx_z2]b , c , d ) . even in such cases , the gas is still heated promptly to @xmath152k for @xmath52 , because of the high efficiency of heating process over ionization mentioned above ( eq .  [ [ eq : heation ] ] ) .",
    "the effects of the uv background radiation is further weakened if one goes to even higher redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : r_z3 ] shows the gas shell trajectories in the high - redshift collapse ( @xmath153 ) . at @xmath91 , about 10% of @xmath78 have already collapsed , and a number of shells either have turned around or are about to turn around .",
    "in addition , compton cooling further promotes the gas collapse at @xmath154 .      in order to quantify the results presented in  [ sec : dyn ] , we plot in figure [ fig : fc_v ] the fraction of gas mass which has cooled and collapsed to the center after the uv onset @xmath90 as a function of circular velocity .",

    ", there exists a sharp cut - off in the collapsed fraction and this threshold lies in the range @xmath161 km s@xmath1 depending on different assumptions on the uv background . in the high - redshift collapse ( @xmath162 ) , on the contrary , the threshold is not so distinct and smaller cloud is able to collapse against the external uv .",

    "figure [ fig : v_z ] illustrates that these quantities depend most largely on the uv spectral index @xmath5 , the evolution of the uv flux , and the collapsing redshift @xmath84 ( we have added to this figure the results for the runs with @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) . compared to the optically thin cases , the adoption of the radiative transfer systematically lowers @xmath163 and @xmath164 by about 5 km s@xmath1 .    for a constant uv flux ( figs [ fig : v_z ] a  c ) , both @xmath163 and @xmath164 decrease with increasing @xmath84 , because of higher gas density and stronger compton cooling . at @xmath169 ,",

    "<S> the effects of the uv background radiation on the formation of sub - galactic clouds are studied by means of one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations . the radiative transfer of the ionizing photons due to the absorption by hi , hei and heii , neglecting the emission , is explicitly taken into account . </S>",

    "<S> s@xmath1 and the 50% reduction in the cooled gas mass with @xmath2 km s@xmath1 . these values depend most sensitively on the collapse epoch of the cloud , the shape of the uv spectrum , and the evolution of the uv intensity . compared to the optically thin case , previously investigated by thoul & weinberg ( 1996 ) , the absorption of the external uv photon by the intervening medium systematically lowers the above threshold values by @xmath3 km s@xmath1 . whether the gas can contract or keeps expanding </S>",

    "<S> we discuss a number of implications on galaxy formation , cosmic star formation history , and the observations of quasar absorption lines . in appendix </S>",
    "<S> , we derive analytical formulae for the photoionization coefficients and heating rates , which incorporate the frequency / direction - dependent transfer of external photons . </S>"
