    "the motivation to study the very forward phase space in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc stems from the potentially very rich field of new phenomena which can be produced in an environment of very high baryochemical potential .",
    "the study of this baryon - dense region in the laboratory will provide important information for the understanding of a quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) state at relatively low temperatures , with different properties from the one in the higher temperature baryon - free region around mid - rapidity , which could exist in the core of neutron stars .",
    "although there are serious technical difficulties in doing calculations for a high baryochemical potential environment , many physicists agree that a lot of interesting phenomena predicted by theory and/or announced by experiments should appear in this region .    in particular , some theoretical considerations suggest @xcite that the phase diagram features a critical endpoint e ( @xmath0 mev and @xmath1 725 mev ) at which the line of the first order phase transition ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) ends . at this point",
    "the phase transition becomes of second order and long wavelength fluctuations appear .",
    "passing close enough to this critical endpoint should have characteristic experimental consequences .",
    "since one can miss the critical point on either of two sides a nonmonotonic dependence of the control parameters should be expected .",
    "other theoretical ideas attracting a lot of attention are : colour superconductive state at finite baryon density @xcite or skyrmions @xcite - coherent states of baryons possibly produced by a dcc .",
    "also strangelets , droplets of strange quark matter are predicted to be formed from the quark gluon plasma , predominantly in a high baryochemical potential environment @xcite .",
    "heavy flavour @xcite and super heavy particles @xcite production is expected to dominate in the forward rapidity region .",
    "it is especially important to note that high energy cosmic ray interactions show the existence of the wide spectrum of exotic events ( centauros , mini  centauros , chirons , geminions , halo - type events etc .",
    "@xcite ) observed at forward rapidities .",
    "these so  called centauro species reveal many surprising features , such as : abnormal hadron dominance , transverse momentum of produced particles much higher than that observed in `` normal '' interactions , the existence of mini  clusters etc .. besides that they are very frequently connected with the so - called _ long - flying ( penetrating ) component _ @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these anomalies are observed at energies above @xmath4 ev and are not rare occurence but they manifest themselves at about 5% level .",
    "it is widely believed that centauro related phenomena could not be due to any kind of statistical fluctuation in the hadronic content of normal events and they have until now defied all attempts at explanation in terms of conventional physics  @xcite .",
    "instead many unconventional models have been proposed .",
    "some of them ( e.g. @xcite ) assume that exotic objects of unknown origin are present in the primary cosmic ray spectrum and they are seen as centauros during their penetration through the atmosphere .",
    "others assume that exotic fireballs are produced in extremely high energy hadron - hadron ( e.g. @xcite ) or nucleus - nucleus ( e.g. @xcite ) interactions .",
    "other unconventional attempts , as for example a dcc scenario @xcite or the color - sextet quark model @xcite , based on pomeron physics in qcd were also developed .",
    "the widespread opinion that the likely mechanism for centauro production is the formation of a quark - gluon plasma was incorporated in a lot of proposed models .",
    "but only the model of the strange quark ",
    "matter fireball @xcite explains simultaneously both the main features of the centauro - like events and the strongly penetrating component accompanying them .",
    "both the experimental characteristics of centauro  related species and the model predictions indicate the forward rapidity region as the most favourable place for production and detection of such anomalous phenomena",
    ".    the lhc will be the first accelerator to effectively probe the very high energy cosmic ray domain , where cosmic ray experiments have detected numerous very unusual events .",
    "these events may be produced and studied at the lhc in controlled conditions .",
    "majority of the present and future nucleus - nucleus experiments concern the exploration of the baryon - free region and  midrapidity physics  .",
    "already several years ago we announced the necessity to investigate the forward rapidity region in future heavy ion experiments @xcite .",
    "a small collaboration has been formed and the castor detector , a unique experimental design to probe the very forward rapidity region in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc and to complement the cern heavy ion physics program pursued essentially in the baryon - free midrapidity region , has been proposed @xcite . in order to illustrate the detector s sensitivity to new effects we have done simulations of centauro - type events by means of our monte - carlo event generator cngen @xcite .",
    "the simulated centauro events have characteristics manifestly different from those predicted by `` classical '' ( e.g. hijing ) generators @xcite .",
    "the different exotic species were also followed through the deep calorimeter by means of modified geant 3.21 @xcite .",
    "we simulated transition curves produced in the castor calorimeter by : dcc clusters ( both neutral and charged ) , centauros , strangelets ( both stable and unstable ) and so  called mixed events produced by baryons and strangelets as the remnants of the centauro fireball explosion . to study the sensitivity of the calorimeter to abnormally penetrating objects a neural network technique",
    "was also developed  @xcite .",
    "different exotic phenomena give different energy deposition patterns and can be well distinguished from the usual events as well as from one another .",

    "this conclusion has been drawn from the analysis of the unbiased sample of 429 families from chacaltaya ( open circles ) , 173 from the pamir - joint chambers and 135 from a part of the pamir chambers of 500 m@xmath6yr ( closed circles ) with total visible energy greater than 100 tev .",
    "a scatter diagram of @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 is shown , where @xmath7 denotes the number of hadrons in a family with visible energy greater than 4 tev , and @xmath9 is the fraction of the total visible energy carried by these hadrons .",
    "the experimental data reveal the existence of several types centauro species such as :    1 .",
    "centauros of original type , 2 .",
    "mini - centauros , 3 .",
    "chirons , 4 .   geminions .",

    "besides that they are very frequently connected with the so - called _ long - flying ( penetrating ) component_. in fact , the strongly penetrating component has two aspects . at first , it has been observed in the apparatus in the form of strongly penetrating single cascades , clusters of showers or the so called `` halo '' .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself by the characteristic energy pattern revealed in shower development in the deep chambers ( calorimeters ) indicating the slow attenuation and many maxima structure .",
    "the second aspect is connected with the anomalously strong penetrability of some objects in the passage through the atmosphere . in principle , both aspects can be connected one to each other and could be different manifestations of the same phenomenon .",
    "anomalous cascade transition curves have been firstly noticed during the study of chiron - type families , where the simultaneous appearance of the unusual hadronic component with the short interaction mean free path , as small as @xmath5 1/3 - 1/2 of the nucleon geometrical collision mean free path has been observed .",
    "subsequently , the strongly penetrating component has been encountered also in other kinds of events @xcite-@xcite .",
    "some of them penetrate through the whole apparatus without noticeable attenuation , sometimes even indicating a tendency to grow .",
    "the most spectacular examples are two exotic cascades detected in the centauro  like event c  k @xcite found in the homogenous type deep lead chamber .",
    "they were observed not far from the energy weighted centre of the family , at very close distance one to each other . both cascades demonstrated a multicore structure and unexpectedly long range and many maxima character . after passing through a very thick layer of lead",
    ", they escaped through the bottom of the chamber .    the longer cascade , shown in fig .  [ fig:197 ] penetrated more than 109 cascade units and 11 maxima appeared along its transition curve .",
    "the average distance between the neighbouring humps is about two times shorter than theoretically expected for conventional hadronic cascades .",
    "recent simulations , assuming four models of hadron - nucleus interactions ( venus 4.12 , qgsjet , hdpm and modified ua5 , all widely used as standard models ) confirmed the unusual character of long - penetrating cascades @xcite .",
    "according to the model developed in  @xcite centauro arises through the hadronization of a qgp fireball of very high baryochemical potential @xmath18 , produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions in the upper atmosphere . in this model",
    "the qgp fireball initially consists of u and d quarks and gluons .",
    "the very high baryochemical potential inhibits the creation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 quark pairs , resulting in the fragmentation of gluons predominantly into s@xmath21 pairs . in the eventual hadronization of the fireball this leads to the strong suppression of pions and hence of photons .",
    "as the fireball evolves strangeness distillation through emission of kaons  @xcite transforms the initial quark matter fireball into an increasingly strange quark matter state .",
    "the stabilizing effects of the strangeness excess prolong the lifetime of the fireball , enabling it to reach mountain - top altitudes  @xcite . in the subsequent decay and hadronization of this state separation of strangeness",
    "can lead to the formation of non - strange baryons , hyperons and/or strangelets .",
    "the main stages of the time development of the centauro fireball are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cen_evolution ] .",
    "the hypothesis that strangelets can be identified as the strongly penetrating particles frequently seen accompanying hadron - rich cosmic ray events has been made and checked  @xcite .",

    "metastable strangelet + @xmath23 a tev , @xmath24 s ) .",
    "our simulations show that the transition curves produced by strangelets during their passage through the chamber resemble the experimentally detected ones . as an example",
    "three cascade curves produced by unstable , metastable and unstable strangelets respectively are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stable_str ] . the long - range cascades observed in the thick homogenous lead / emulsion chambers could be the result of a strangelet penetration through the apparatus .",
    "their strong penetrating power can be connected both with the small interaction cross section ( in comparison with nucleus of comparable a ) of the strangelet and with the big concentration of its energy in a narrow region of phase space .",
    "this energy could be liberated into conventional particle production in many consecutive evaporation or interaction acts . in this way numerous hadron - rich families accompanied by highly penetrating cascades , clusters or halo",
    "could be explained by assuming the same mechanism of the formation of a strange quark matter fireball and its successive decay into predominantly baryons and strangelet(s ) .",
    "therefore , in this model both the basic characteristics of cosmic ray centauro ( small multiplicities and extreme imbalance of hadronic to electromagnetic content ) and the strongly penetrating component are naturally explained .",
    "the model is used to make predictions for centauro and strangelet formation in pb+pb collisions at the lhc . in table",

    "as the search for strongly penetrating species which could be produced by strangelets is one of the aims of the castor detector , some questions concerning their possible production and consequences of their existence should be considered .",
    "it is especially important in view of the recent debate @xcite-@xcite on the possibility of a catastrophic scenario initiated by strangelets formed in the future collider experiments .",
    "the strange quark matter ( sqm ) is a matter with strangeness per baryon of the order of unity , containing a comparable fraction of up , down and strange quarks .",
    "the existence of stable sqm was postulated by e. witten @xcite .",
    "introduction of a third flavour creates an additional fermi well and thus reduces the energy relative to a two  flavour system what can thereby making the system stable .",
    "the anticipated mass range for this kind of matter lies anywhere between the masses of light nuclei and neutron stars @xmath25 .",
    "the latter are called _",
    "strange stars_. strange matter as part of cosmic radiation is sometimes reffered to as strange quark _ nuggets _ or _",
    "nuclearities_. smaller amounts of strange quark matter are usually called _ droplets _ of strange quark matter , or simply _",
    "strangelets_. its existence , however , is purely an experimental question since computations in qcd can not come close to answering this enormously important conjecture .",
    "sqm could have important cosmological consequences for today s universe which arise from the possibility that the early universe might have undergone a first - order phase transition from sqm to the nuclear matter .",
    "strangelets left over from that era could also account for the cosmological dark matter problem .",
    "the properties of some forms of hypothetical strange matter , as small lumps of strange quark matter ( strangelets ) or hyperon matter ( metastable multihypernuclear objects memo s ) have been widely discussed with special emphasis on their relevance to the present and future heavy ion experiments .",
    "different aspects of strange quark matter physics , as for example the stability question are described in the reviews @xcite .",
    "contrary to normal nuclei , sqm stability increases with a and the threshold of its stability is close to @xmath26 . but",
    "also quite small strangelets might gain stability due to shell effects .",
    "however , due to the lack of theoretical constraints on bag model parameters and difficulties in calculating color magnetic interactions and finite size effects , experiments are necessary to answer the question of the stability of strangelets .",
    "strangelets may arise from various scenarios ; they could be formed in high energy nuclear collisions or they might be of cosmological origin , as remnants of the cosmic qcd phase transition . collisions of strange stars could also lead to the formation of strangelets which could contribute to the cosmic ray flux .",
    "e. witten @xcite suggested the possibility of production of small lumps of sqm , in today s universe by quark(neutron ) stars , in the process of their conversion to more stable sqm stars .",
    "several types of models are applied to describe the strangelet production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "they can be classified into two categories , namely _ strangelet production by coalescense _ of hyperons or _ by production following a creation of quark - gluon plasma_. in a very popular coalescense model , an ensemble of quarks , which are products of nucleus - nucleus collisions , form a composite state which fuses to form a strangelet @xcite .",
    "formation of quark - gluon plasma is not needed in this scenario , as hyperons coalesce during the late stage of the collision forming a doorway state for strangelet production .",
    "such a scenario favours the production of low mass strangelets ( @xmath27 is rather unlikely ) in the midrapidity region .",
    "thermal models assume that chemical and thermal equilibrium are achieved prior to final particle production .",
    "coalescense and thermal models usually predict lower strangelet cross section than models postulating a qgp as an intermediate state in a strangelet formation . the _ strangelet distillation mechanism _ provides a possibility for producing more stable large strangelets since the qgp would lose energy by meson emission , possibly resulting in a strangelet of approximately the same a as the qgp droplet .",
    "the present status of strange quark matter searches , both in cosmic rays and in accelerator experiments is presented by r. klingenberg in his recent review @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation concerning the existence of sqm is quite intriguing .",
    "many accelerator experiments are looking for strange quark matter in heavy ion collisions .",
    "they are mostly based on such discerning properties of strangelets as an unusual charge to mass ratio ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the strange counterparts of ordinary nuclei are searched for in high - energy collisions at brookhaven and at cern . to date",
    "no experiment has published results indicating a clear positive signal for strangelets , although some candidates have been announced @xcite .",
    "accelerator experiments are able to set upper limits on the existence of strangelets in the range of sensitivity of the experiments but they are not able to answer the question concerning their existence",
    ". there are several definite reasons for this .",
    "the main ones are that the experiments are sensitive only to metastable strangelets with proper lifetimes greater than @xmath29 s and that they look for strangelets in the midrapidity region .",
    "production limits obtained in these experiments are strongly dependent upon the production model assumed for lumps of strange quark matter .",
    "searches for sqm have been made also on terrestrial matter , cosmic rays and astrophysical objects .",
    "the searches resulted in low limits for strangelets in terrestrial matter but on the other hand _ two seismic events _ with the properties of the passage of sqm nuggets through the earth have been reported recently @xcite .",
    "morever , a lot of cosmic ray anomalies could be understood by assuming the presence of strangelets in cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "these , reviewed in @xcite are :    1 .   _ massive and relatively low charged objects , i.e. _ : * two anomalous events , with value of charge @xmath30 and of mass number a@xmath31 350 and @xmath31 450 observed in primary cosmic rays by a balloon counter experiment @xcite ; * the so  called price s event @xcite with z @xmath31 46 and a @xmath32 1000 ; * the so",

    "+ as well as centauro - like events as the strongly penetrating component are postulated to be the signs of strangelets passage through the matter .",
    "some explanations assume that strangelets are a component of primary cosmic rays @xcite , while others assume that they are produced in collisions of cosmic ray nuclei in the atmosphere @xcite .    there are some speculations @xcite that under some conditions the small metastable sqm drops ( produced for instance in heavy ion collisions ) could be  rapidly grown  to a larger stable size , feeding in neutrons or light nuclei and releasing energy in photons . for such behaviour numerous conditions should be fulfilled .",
    "first of all strangelets must have rather low velocity ( must be produced close to the midrapidity in collider experiments ) and a negative charge .",
    "a number of reasons have been put forward , theoretical as well as experimental , why such a scenario is exceedingly unlikely @xcite@xcite and it is argued that experiments at rhic and lhc do not represent a threat to our planet .",
    "the main arguments are :    * large safety factors derived from the survival of the moon and the observed rate of supernovae @xcite ; * phenomena indicating the appearance of strangelets in cosmic rays ; * much higher probability of strangelet production in baryon  rich fragmentation regions than at midrapidity ; * predicted positive charge of strangelets @xcite .",
    "the strongest argument seems to be the existence of the aformentioned phenomena which could be the manifestation of strangelets in cosmic rays . among theoretical arguments",
    "the prediction of a positive electric charge for strangelets seems to be especially convincing one .",
    "strange matter would have been neutral , if the ground state composition consisted of equal numbers of quarks of three flavours , which is the most favoured state .",
    "actually , however , the @xmath35 quark is heavier than the other two flavours and so their number is slightly less than that of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 quarks , as a result of which it has a small positive charge .",
    "j. madsen showed @xcite that , in fact , stable sqm may be negatively charged in bulk , however , the reduction in strange quark occupation in the surface layer , which is responsible for surface tension , causes the intermediate mass strangelets to be always positively charged .",
    "morever , in his more recent work @xcite he showed that strange ",
    "quark matter in a color - flavour locked state is bound stronger than `` ordinary ''",
    "strange quark matter .",
    "this increases the probability of formation of metastable or even absolutely stable strangelets and leads to a stronger reduction in number of negatively charged s - quarks in the surface layer . a total positive quark charge of color - flavour locked strangelets is expected to be proportional to the surface area or a@xmath38 .",

    "the layers are inclined at 45@xmath39 relative to the impinging particles in order to maximize the cherenkov light yield .",

    "centauro events characterized by various values of parameters : temperature ( @xmath64 = 250 , 300 mev ) , quarkchemical potential ( @xmath60 = 600 , 1000 mev ) and nuclear stopping power ( @xmath65 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 corresponding to an effective stopping in the range @xmath5 1.5 - 3.0 pseudorapidity units ) were analysed . in these events",
    "strangelets with baryonic numbers @xmath61 = 20 - 40 and energies @xmath66 8 - 20 tev were formed .",
    "two examples of the resulting transition curves produced by a centauro event with an unstable and stable strangelet born among its secondaries are shown in fig .",
    "[ st_20_20_bis ] .",
    "the energies of exotic objects ( centauro and the strangelet ) within the castor acceptance were : @xmath5 128 tev and @xmath5 126 tev respectively in comparison to @xmath5 156 tev predicted by hijing for the conventional central pb+pb event .",
    "our analysis indicates that the centauro events ( whether accompanied and not accompanied by a strangelet ) can be easily distinguished from conventional events .",
    "centauro transition curve in the calorimeter is expected to have manifestly different shape and longer extent than that produced by a conventional event .",
    "the centauro produced signal has a maximum at about 14th calorimeter layer with the average at @xmath67 25 .",
    "the hijing event produces the maximum of the signal at about the 8th calorimeter layer , with the average at @xmath68 19 .",
    "generally , the centauro produced signal is stronger in the deeper ( hadronic ) part of the calorimeter , as opposed to the hijing generated one , which is peaked in the electromagnetic section of the calorimeter .",
    "the qcd phase transition from normal hadronic matter to the quark - gluon - plasma , manifests itself in two forms : deconfinement transition and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "one of interesting consequences of the chiral transition is the possible formation of a chiral condensate in an extended domain , such that the direction of the condensate is misaligned from the true vacuum direction .",
    "formation of these so called disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) domains in high energy collisions of both hadrons and heavy ions , has been proposed by many authors ( see for example @xcite )",
    ". a basic signature of dcc production is the presence of very large event - by - event fluctuations in the fraction of produced neutral pions .",
    "thus , there are some suspicions that this phenomenon could also be responsible for the centauro - like events .",
    "we have simulated the passage of dcc clusters ( both charged and neutral ) through the deep calorimeter and they also show characteristic transition curves  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ex ] ) .      [ ex ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex ] are shown for comparison examples of transition curves produced by different exotic phenomena , among them charged and neutral dcc clusters , strangelets , centauros and mixed events .",
    "the curves presented are the sum of the exotic signals and the conventional background .",
    "all these phenomena give different patterns and could be easily distinguished from conventional events as well as from each other .",
    "this method is sensitive to the detection of any kind of strangelets : both neutral and charged , as well as short - lived and long - lived .",
    "this is an important feature in the light of present experiments which are only able to detect strangelets with lifetimes longer than @xmath69 s. it is seen that the energy deposition pattern in a deep calorimeter can be an excellent signature of a qgp state decaying in different exotic ways .    for the configuration of the calorimeter studied here",
    "the extraction of the exotic phenomena signal from the conventionally produced background will be straight forward for energies higher that @xmath5 10 tev . in order to study the sensitivity of the calorimeter to",
    "abnormally penetrating objects of lower energies , we developed a neural network technique  @xcite based on a multilayer perception network .",
    "on the input layer are fed the signals from the readout units of one octant , the output layer consists of one neuron providing a yes / no answer , and there is one hidden layer .",
    "we tested the method using simulated strangelets .",
    "one set of 10000 5 tev strangelets and 10000 background events was used as the training sample and a different such set as the evaluation sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the enhancement obtained in the signal / background ratio through the application of this technique to a calorimeter consisting of 15 readout units per octant , for different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer .",
    "an enhancement of _",
    "o_(10@xmath70 ) is obtained for efficiency @xmath31 95  % .",
