    "early studies on superstring theory and m - theory have suggested that our four dimensional world is embedded into a higher dimensional spacetime . particularly , the 10 dimensional @xmath3 heterotic superstring theory is a low - energy limit of the 11 dimensional supergravity , under the compactification scheme @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus , the 10 dimensional spacetime is compactified as @xmath5 , implying that our universe ( a brane ) is embedded into a higher dimensional bulk . in this paradigm ,",
    "the standard model particles are open strings , confined on the braneworld , whilst the gravitons and the closed strings can freely propagate into the bulk @xcite .    among the collection of the braneworld scenarios , the randall - sundrum type ii model has the virtue of providing a new type of compactification of gravity @xcite .",
    "standard 4d gravity can be recovered in the low - energy limit of the model , with a 3-brane of positive tension embedded in 5d anti - de sitter bulk .",
    "the covariant formulation of the brane world models has been formulated in @xcite , leading to the modification of the standard friedmann equations on the brane .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics of the early universe is altered by the quadratic terms in the energy density and by the contribution of the components of the bulk weyl tensor , which both give a contribution in the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this implies a modification of the basic equations describing the cosmological and astrophysical dynamics , which has been extensively considered recently @xcite .",
    "the recent observations of the cmb anisotropy by wmap @xcite have provided convincing evidence for the inflationary paradigm @xcite , according to which in its very early stages the universe experienced an accelerated ( de sitter ) expansionary phase ( for recent reviews on inflation see @xcite ) .    at the end of inflation ,",
    "the universe is in a cold and low - entropy phase , which is utterly different from the present hot high - entropy universe",
    ". therefore the universe should be reheated , or defrosted , to a high enough temperature , in order to recover the standard hot big bang @xcite .",
    "the reheating process may be envisioned as follows : the energy density in zero - momentum mode of the scalar field decays into normal particles with decay rate @xmath6 .",
    "the decay products then scattered and thermalize to form a plasma @xcite .    apart from the behavior of the inflaton field , the evolutions of dark energy and dark matter in reheating stage were also considered . in @xcite ,",
    "dark energy and dark matter were originated from a scalar field in different stages of the inflation , according to a special form of potential .",
    "meanwhile , the conditions for unifying the description of inflation , dark matter and dark energy were considered in @xcite .",
    "a specific model was later proposed in @xcite , by using a modified quadratic scalar potential .",
    "the candidates of dark matter in @xcite and @xcite were oscillations of a scalar field .",
    "however , it may be possible that dark matter existed on its own without originating from the scalar field .",
    "this may pose less stringent constraint on the scalar field , so that dark matter can be included in inflation paradigm in a easier way . on the other hand",
    ", it was proposed that the decay products of scalar field acquired thermal mass @xcite .",
    "the reheating in the braneworld models has also been considered recently . in the context of the braneworld inflation driven by a bulk scalar field ,",
    "the energy dissipation from the bulk scalar field into the matter on the brane was studied in @xcite .",
    "the obtained results supports the idea that the brane inflation model , caused by a bulk scalar field , may be a viable alternative scenario of the early universe .",
    "the inflation and reheating in a brane world model derived from type iia string theory was studied in @xcite . in this model",
    "the inflaton can decay into scalar and spinor particles , thus reheating the universe .",
    "a model in which high energy brane corrections allow a single scalar field to describe inflation at early epochs and quintessence at late times was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the reheating mechanism in the model originates from born - infeld matter , whose energy density mimics cosmological constant at very early times and manifests itself as radiation subsequently .",
    "the particle production at the collision of two domain walls in a 5-dimensional minkowski spacetime was studied in @xcite .",
    "this may provide the reheating mechanism of an ekpyrotic ( or cyclic ) brane universe , in which two bps branes collide and evolve into a hot big bang universe .",
    "the reheating temperature @xmath7 in models in which the universe exits reheating at temperatures in the mev regime was studied in @xcite , and a minimum bound on @xmath7 was obtained .",
    "the derived lower bound on the reheating temperature also leads to very stringent bounds on the compactification scale in models with @xmath8 large extra dimensions .",
    "the dark matter problem in the randall - sundrum type ii brane world scenario was discussed in @xcite , by assuming that the lightest supersymmetric particle is the axino .",
    "the axinos can play the role of cold dark matter in the universe , due to the higher reheating temperatures in the brane world model , as compared to the conventional four - dimensional cosmology .",
    "the impact of the non - conventional brane cosmology on the relic abundance of non - relativistic stable particles in high and low reheating scenarios was investigated in @xcite . in the case of high reheating temperatures ,",
    "the brane cosmology may enhance the dark matter relic density by many order of magnitudes , and a stringent lower bound on the five dimensional scale may be obtained .",
    "in the non - equilibrium case , the resulting relic density is very small .",
    "the curvaton dynamics in brane - world cosmologies was studied in @xcite . by assuming that the inflaton field survives without decay after the end of inflation , the curvaton reheating mechanism was applied to the randall - sundrum model and to its curvature corrections .",
    "recently , motivated by particle physics results , the possibility of an energy exchange between the bulk and the brane was also suggested .",
    "the observational constraints on the cosmological models in the brane - world scenario in which the bulk is not empty , and exchange of mass - energy between the bulk and the bane is allowed , were explored in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of matter fields on the brane is modified due to new terms in the energy momentum tensor describing this exchange .",
    "this model accounts for the observed suppression of the cmb power spectrum at low multipoles , and the observed recent cosmic acceleration is attributable to the flow of matter from the bulk to the brane .",
    "the cosmological evolution of a brane with a general bulk matter content was considered in @xcite , by assuming that the bulk pressure and the energy exchange densities are comparable to the brane energy density . by adopting a phenomenological fluid ansatz and generalizations of it , a set of exact solutions of the friedmann equation that exhibit accelerated expansion",
    "were derived .",
    "the braneworld models with bulk - brane energy exchange allow for crossing of the @xmath9 phantom divide line without introducing phantom energy with quantum instabilities @xcite .",
    "the class of the braneworld models with bulk - brane energy exchange have the ability to provide crossing of the phantom divide , and the observational cosmological data hint towards natural values for the model parameters .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to construct a model of braneworld reheating by adopting as a key feature the energy exchange between the bulk and the brane during the reheating stage .",
    "the era of focus will be from the end of inflation until the present time , in contrast with @xcite and @xcite . in order to explain the present day composition of our universe , we adopt , as an essential characteristic of our model , the hypothesis that the existence of the dark matter is the result of the real matter exchange between the bulk and the brane . however , the other matter fields bare no such freedom , according to the confinement conditions introduced in @xcite .",
    "the main physical features of our model can be presented as follows : the dark matter from the bulk and flows to the brane after the inflationary phase , while the scalar fields and the normal matter are always confined on the brane .",
    "therefore the bulk leaves an imprint on the brane by injecting dark matter .",
    "the effect of dark matter flowing into the brane is studied in the context of the cosmological composition , with the reheating temperature as an important parameter .",
    "the inflaton field decays into the normal matter field @xcite , attaining thermal equilibrium and acquiring plasma masses through the mechanism proposed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , as reheating is concerned , the presence of the scalar field is essential , and it decays into visible matter only .",
    "furthermore , the specific forms of the inflaton potential are not essential in our approach , since during reheating , the kinetic term @xmath10 plays a crucial role .",
    "the main focus of the present paper is to study the dynamics of the universe by taking into account the extra - dimensional effects on the reheating process .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 of the energy densities of the dark matter and of the normal matter is an important parameter of our model , and its time evolution is studied by using both analytical and numerical methods .",
    "as a test of the model , several important observational parameters like the maximum density of the matter in the universe and the reheating temperature @xmath12 are also estimated .",
    "hence , we adopt as our main observational constraints the constancy of the ratio @xmath11 after the photon decoupling , the absence of the inflaton in the present day universe , and the bound of @xmath12 from gravitino product , @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic equations of our model are formulated in section ii .",
    "a dimensionless form of the field equations is presented in section iii , where the physically acceptable range of the values of the physical parameters is also discussed .",
    "the extra - dimensional effects dominated phase of the reheating , during which the quadratic terms in the energy density dominate the dynamics and evolution of the universe , is discussed in section iv .",
    "the reheating process is considered in its full generality in section v , and the role of the linear terms in the energy density is investigated . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we summarize and conclude our results .",
    "we start by considering a five dimensional ( @xmath13 ) spacetime ( the bulk ) , with a single four - dimensional ( @xmath14 ) brane , on which usual ( baryonic ) matter and physical fields are confined .",
    "the @xmath14 brane world @xmath15 is located at a hypersurface @xmath16 in the @xmath13 bulk spacetime @xmath17 , of which coordinates are described by @xmath18 .",
    "the induced @xmath14 coordinates on the brane are @xmath19 .",

    "the brane tension is the characteristic energy scale of the brane , below which the quadratic terms in the field equations , derived from the action eq .",
    "( [ bulk ] ) , can be neglected .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath32 the field equations reduce to the usual form of the standard general relativity .",

    "a brane is a fixed point of the @xmath38 symmetry . in the following we assume @xmath39",
    "the induced @xmath14 metric is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the space - like unit vector field normal to the brane hypersurface @xmath42 .",
    "the basic equations on the brane are obtained by projections onto the brane world , and are given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "apart from the terms quadratic in the brane energy - momentum tensor , in the field equations on the brane there are two supplementary terms , corresponding to the projection of the @xmath13 weyl tensor @xmath47 and of the projected tensor @xmath48 , which contains the bulk matter contribution .",
    "both terms induce bulk effects on the brane .    for cosmological applications we adopt a metric of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the maximally symmetric 3-space , and we denoted the fifth coordinate by @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath8 are the scale and shift factors , respectively .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath53 on the brane , describing the cosmological dynamics of the universe , is defined as @xmath54 .",

    "on the brane the matter , consisting of normal matter , dark matter , a scalar field etc .",
    ", is in a perfect fluid form , and is described in terms of a total energy density @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are the energy densities of the individual components , and a total thermodynamic pressure @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath57 are the pressures of the matter fluid components .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor on the brane is @xmath60    the delta function @xmath61 implies the confinement of the matter fields on the brane at @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that the matter component in the bulk is in the form of dark matter , with energy density @xmath63 and pressure @xmath64 , respectively , with energy - momentum tensor @xmath65    then the energy momentum tensor @xmath66 of dark matter in the bulk has the non - zero components : @xmath67 where the five - velocity @xmath68 represents the matter flow from the bulk to the brane @xcite . hence in our model the dark matter",
    "can exist simultaneously in the bulk and on the brane .",
    "the term @xmath69 is the discontinuity of the ( 0,5 ) component of energy momentum tensor at @xmath62 . in the static bulk with respect to the expanding brane , @xmath68",
    "is given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the bulk curvature radius , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the planck mass and the cosmological constant in the 5 dimensional bulk , respectively @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dark matter obeys an equation of state of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant .    to obtain @xmath76",
    "we follow the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the present day critical density and @xmath79 is the value of the scale factor at the moment when the energy transfer from the bulk to the brane begins , we obtain @xmath80    the dimensionless parameter @xmath81 describes the flow of dark matter from bulk to brane . finally , the evolution equation of the dark matter on the brane is @xcite @xmath82    in the widely accepted inflationary scenario it is assumed that during an initial period the universe is dominated by a large , approximately constant potential term @xmath83 of a scalar field @xmath28 , known as the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field can be written in the perfect fluid form , with energy density @xmath84 and pressure @xmath85 given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively . during a second period of evolution ,",
    "the potential minimum is approached , @xmath83 tends to zero , and the scalar field starts to fluctuate violently around the minimum value .",
    "the coupling to the field component becomes effective and the scalar field energy is converted into matter energy , thus giving rise to a large increase of the entropy @xcite .",
    "inflationary scenarios have always to face the problem of the transition from a de sitter stage , during which the evolution of the universe is dominated by the scalar field , to a subsequent radiation - or matter - dominated friedmann - robertson - walker type cosmological model .",
    "one of the possible approaches to this problem is phenomenological @xcite , and consists in the introduction of a suitable loss term in the scalar field dynamics , which also appears as a source term for the energy density of the matter fluid .",
    "it is this source term which is responsible for the reheating process that follows the adiabatic supercooling process during the de sitter phase . to describe mathematically",
    "the process is convenient to introduce a `` friction '' term @xmath88 , describing the decay rate of the scalar field , and a corresponding term for the matter fluid .",
    "therefore , the basic equations describing the reheating phase after braneworld inflation , with matter exchange between the brane and the bulk , are given by @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the cosmological constant on the brane , @xmath96 is the so - called dark radiation term , and we have assumed the existence of a single matter component on the brane , with energy density @xmath97 and pressure @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "the system of equations eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])-([eqd ] ) can be simplified by adopting some , physically justified , approximations .",
    "first of all , the @xmath14 cosmological constant @xmath99 can be neglected , as its derived value from the 3rd year wmap data is around @xmath100gev@xmath2 @xcite , which is a small fraction of the energy density up to at least the photon decoupling period .",
    "also the curvature term can be taken as zero , @xmath101 , as the universe is observed to be nearly flat . moreover ,",
    "under the conditions considered in this paper , the dark radiation term @xmath102 is negligibly small as compared with the other components @xcite .",
    "an important relation to characterize the matter is the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath103 .",
    "the product particles have different equations of state in various time scales .",
    "the index @xmath104 is @xmath105 for radiation before the radiation - matter equality time at @xmath106years @xmath107 sec . , and @xmath108 for non - relativistic matter after @xmath109 .",
    "the constant @xmath110 determining the eos of dark matter will be fixed in various scenarios .",
    "it takes the value @xmath111 for hot dark matter ( hdm ) , and @xmath112 for cold dark matter ( cdm ) , just like in the case of ordinary matter .",
    "next we consider the scalar field properties . in the post - inflationary stage ,",
    "the inflaton field executes coherent oscillations about the minimum of the potential @xcite .",
    "therefore the kinetic term dominates the potential term in the reheating era , thus leading to @xmath113    the explicit expression of the decay width of the scalar field can be represented as @xcite , @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the coupling constant and the mass of inflaton respectively . assuming that the thermodynamic equilibrium is established , @xmath117 is the temperature of the decay product , and it can be related to the matter density @xmath118 . generally , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a constant . if the matter is in the form of radiation , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . in the matter - dominated universe ,",

    "<S> the emergence of the cosmological composition ( the reheating era ) after the inflationary period is analyzed in the framework of the braneworld models , in which our universe is a three - brane embedded in a five - dimensional bulk , by assuming the possibility of the brane - bulk energy exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the inflaton field is assumed to decay into normal matter only , while the dark matter is injected into the brane from the bulk . to describe the reheating process </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a phenomenological approach , by describing the decay of the inflaton field by a friction term proportional to the energy density of the field . after the radiation dominated epoch </S>",
    "<S> the model reduces to the standard four dimensional cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> the modified field equations are analyzed analytically and numerically in both the extra - dimensions dominate reheating phase ( when the quadratic terms in energy density dominate the dynamics ) , and in the general case . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution profiles of the matter , of the scalar field and of the scale factor of the universe are obtained for different values of the parameters of the model , and of the equations of state of the normal and dark matter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the equation describing the time evolution of the ratio of the energy density of the dark and of the normal matter is also obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio depends on the rate of the energy flow between the bulk and the brane . </S>",
    "<S> the observational constraint of an approximately constant ratio of the dark and of the baryonic matter requires that the dark matter must be non - relativistic ( cold ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts a reheating temperature of the order of @xmath0 gev , a brane tension of the order of @xmath1 gev@xmath2 , and the obtained composition of the universe is consistent with the observational data . </S>"
