    "the standard model ( sm ) is now well established as the effective theory of the quarks , leptons and the gauge bosons below the tev scale .",
    "however , it is almost universally believed that the sm is not the final theory .",
    "many extensions of the sm have been proposed to solve some of the shortcomings of the sm .",
    "grand unified theories have been proposed to unify the three gauge couplings into one .",
    "supersymmetric extensions have been proposed to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "a singlet higgs boson , with a @xmath10 symmetry has been added to the sm which can serve as a plausible candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "one or more extra space - like compact dimensions has been added to the usual four dimensions to incorporate tev scale as the fundamental scale of gravity @xcite , or to unify the gauge and higgs bosons , and as well as the fermions , and understand the yukawa interactions as part of the gauge interactions @xcite .",
    "most of these extensions involve new gauge interactions , commonly an extra @xmath0 , as well as new particles beyond the sm .",
    "many kinds of extra @xmath0 gauge symmetries have been considered .",
    "these include the left - right symmetric model @xcite , @xmath11 or @xmath12 guts , superstring @xmath12 models @xcite , topflavor models @xcite , and string - inspired supersymmetric models.@xcite in most of these models , the sm fermions and the electroweak ( ew ) higgs boson carry non - trivial charges under the @xmath0 .",
    "other variations of the extra @xmath0 symmetry , such as a hadro - phobic @xmath0 , lepto - phobic @xmath0 , and an extra @xmath0 which couples only to the third family of fermions have been considered @xcite .",
    "hidden sectors of matter are ubiquitous among models due to the need to break supersymmetry , as well as the common addition of particle dark matter which can not be charged under the standard model gauge groups unless it is very heavy.@xcite an extra @xmath0 can be a natural way to link the `` dark '' sector with the standard model .    in this work , we consider an extra @xmath0 symmetry @xcite in which the sm particles ( the sm fermions , gauge bosons and the ew doublet higgs bosons ) are neutral .",
    "we call this a hidden extra @xmath0 @xcite",
    ". only new exotic quarks , and the ew singlet higgs bosons couple to this extra @xmath0 gauge boson .",
    "these exotic quarks and the ew singlet higgs bosons act as messenger particles between the hidden @xmath0 sector and the sm sector .",
    "this extra @xmath0 symmetry is broken at the ew scale by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the ew singlet higgs boson .",
    "thus this extra gauge boson , the exotic quarks , and the singlet higgs boson all acquire masses at the ew scale , and can be searched for at high energy colliders , such as the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the dominant signals of our scenario at the hadron colliders are multi-@xmath2 and multi - lepton final states , with little or no missing energy .",
    "our gauge symmetry is the usual standard model @xmath13 supplemented by an extra @xmath0 symmetry , which we call @xmath14 .",
    "we introduce two exotic quarks @xmath15 and @xmath16 which are color triplets and singlets under the @xmath1 gauge symmetry , but charged under the @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the gauge boson for the @xmath14 by @xmath18 .",
    "we also introduce a complex higgs field @xmath19 which is a color and ew singlet , and has a charge @xmath20 under the @xmath14 .",
    "this singlet higgs field has a vev @xmath21 at the tev or ew scale , and breaks the @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian for the gauge part of the interaction for the exotic @xmath22 quark is given by the usual gauge interaction under the @xmath23 symmetry with the gauge coupling @xmath24 .",
    "the ew and @xmath14 interactions of the matter fields with the gauge bosons can be obtained from the lagrangian : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the @xmath1 quark and lepton doublets while @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath22 are the @xmath1 up- , down - quark , lepton and exotic quark singlets , respectively .",
    "the different covariant derivatives are defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 s are the pauli matrices ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the charges of the matter fields under the @xmath17 and the new gauge group @xmath14 respectively ; while @xmath18 represents the new gauge boson .    the higgs potential , with the usual doublet higgs @xmath35 and the ew singlet higgs @xmath19 , is @xmath36 we can also write a mass term for the vector - like quark , @xmath37 note that the new exotic vector - like quark @xmath22 is like a new flavor , and it has color , hypercharge , and an extra @xmath14 interaction , but no @xmath1 interaction . since this new @xmath22 quark is vector - like with respect to both @xmath0 as well as @xmath38 , the model is anomaly free . without any other interaction ,",
    "the @xmath22 quark will be stable .",
    "as none of the sm particles are charged under the new @xmath14 symmetry , the new symmetry will remain hidden from the sm , provided the gauge - kinetic - mixing terms are strongly suppressed . however , its gauge quantum numbers allow flavor changing yukawa interactions with the bottom , strange , and down quarks via the singlet higgs boson @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath39 note that in order the above lagrangian to be hypercharge singlet , the hypercharge of both @xmath15 and @xmath16 must be equal to that of @xmath40 .",
    "this also requires that the @xmath14 charge ( @xmath34 ) for the exotic quark @xmath22 must satisfy @xmath41 .",
    "such a term in the lagrangian leads to mixing between the down - type quarks with the new exotic vector - like quark @xmath22 , giving rise to ew decay modes for the heavy quark .",
    "we assume that the parameters in the higgs potential are such that @xmath35 has vev at the electroweak ( ew ) and @xmath19 has a vev around the tev scale .",
    "then , in the unitary gauge , we can write the @xmath35 and @xmath19 fields as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the vev of the doublet higgs , and @xmath21 is the singlet vev . from the minimization of the higgs potential , we obtain , @xmath44 the scalar mass - squared matrix in the ( @xmath45 ) basis is given by @xmath46 the masses of the two mass eigenstate higgs scalars @xmath47 and @xmath48 as well as their mixing angle @xmath49 , in terms of the fundamental parameters of the lagrangian , can be obtained from the above mass matrix . in particular , the mixing angle @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 in addition to the usual gauge interaction for the @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the interaction among the higgs from the potential @xmath53 after symmetry breaking is given by @xmath54 the interaction among the higgs mass eigenstates @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be obtained by using @xmath55    to explore the phenomenological implications of the model , we need to consider the various mixings which lead to the effective interaction of these exotic particles to sm particles and are responsible for their decays .",
    "we have already considered the mixing in the scalar sector of the model which has interesting consequences for higgs searches at colliders such as lhc @xcite .",
    "we also find that by allowing the yukawa interactions given in eq .",
    "[ yextra ] , there will be mixing between the down - type quarks with the new exotic quark @xmath22 once the scalar @xmath19 gets a vev .",
    "the mixing between the down - type quarks with the exotic @xmath22 quark gives rise to ew decay modes for the heavy quark .",
    "the heavy @xmath56 also has additional interactions which lead to interesting decay modes .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that only @xmath57 is non - zero in eq .",
    "[ yextra ] while the other yukawa coefficients are negligibly small .",
    "this would imply that the exotic quark mixes only with the bottom quark , thus indirectly affecting the top - bottom vertex ( @xmath58 in the ckm matrix ) as well as inducing a coupling between the exotic @xmath22 quark with the top quark .",
    "the mixing can be parametrized in terms of two mixing angles @xmath59 and @xmath60 which represent the mixing angles of the @xmath61 and @xmath40 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . expressing the gauge eigenstates for the mixing quarks as @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "the mass matrix in the ( @xmath64 ) basis is given by @xmath65 this matrix can be diagonalized with a bi - unitary transformation @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are unitary matrices which rotate the left - chiral and right - chiral gauge eigenstates to the mass eigenstates respectively .",
    "the interaction of the physical mass eigenstates ( @xmath69 ) can then be obtained by writing the gauge basis states as @xmath70 the rotation matrices @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 the corresponding mixing angles for the left- and right - handed fields follow from diagonalizing the matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively and are given by @xmath75",
    "in hadronic colliders such as the lhc and tevatron , the dominant signals arise from the pair productions of the exotic colored quarks , @xmath22 and @xmath76 , and their subsequent decays ( because @xmath22 has hypercharge , the lep2 bound of @xmath77 100 gev on its mass applies @xcite ) .",
    "the other important production process is the pair productions of the exotic quark in association with the new @xmath14 gauge boson , @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that this is the only way the new gauge boson @xmath18 can be produced on - shell at lhc because of its very suppressed or vanishing couplings to the sm particles in this model . in the following subsections we discuss the signals from the @xmath79 production .",
    "we also discuss the couplings of the extra gauge boson @xmath56 with the sm particles .",
    "the heavy exotic quarks being colored particles will be produced copiously at the lhc through strong interactions .",
    "the major contribution , as in the case of top quarks , would come from the gluon induced subprocess ( @xmath77 80% ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : csec ] we plot the pair production cross section for the process @xmath80 at lhc for two different center - of - mass energies ( 7 tev and 14 tev ) .    ) .",
    "we use the cteq6l1 parton distribution functions ( pdf ) @xcite for the protons .",
    "we have set the scale @xmath81.__,width=384 ]    the figure clearly shows that one can have quite large production cross section for such an exotic quark at the lhc and its signals should be observable through its decay products .",
    "we have implemented the model into calchep @xcite to calculate the production cross sections as well as the two - body decays of the new particles in the model .",
    "the heavy quark in the gauge eigenbasis couples directly to the @xmath56 gauge boson through the @xmath14 charge , with the gauge coupling strength @xmath82 . however , its decay is more dependent on the mixing parameters resulting from its mixing with the @xmath2 quark , leading to a much richer phenomenology .",
    "the heavy exotic itself is a mixed mass eigenstate and we list its couplings to the other particles of the model in table [ feynrules ] .",
    ".__the effective coupling of the exotic @xmath22 quark with the other particles in the model .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling with photon and the strong coupling with gluon is the same as any down - type quarks in the sm .",
    "couplings are of the form @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that we have put @xmath85 .",
    "_ _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     final state with @xmath86 also stands out against the sm background , where one gets the sm cross sections to be quite small as it is already @xmath87 suppressed compared to the @xmath88 cross section .",
    "the sm background is much larger for the final states @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where the significant sm background results from the @xmath92 production . for the final states @xmath89 one can get rid of the huge @xmath92 background by demanding @xmath93 .",
    "this helps in improving the significance of the signal , even though we also lose a large fraction of the signal events in the process . for the other final state",
    ", we find that at leading order , at lhc with @xmath94 collision energy of @xmath95 tev , the @xmath91 sm background is @xmath96 pb .",
    "as the leading two @xmath2-jets in our signal come from the decays of the heavy exotic @xmath22 quark , we put a stronger @xmath3 cut of @xmath97 gev .",
    "this reduces the signal by two - thirds .",
    "however the sm background is reduced by more than an order of magnitude , and becomes @xmath98 fb for @xmath95 tev collisions while it is @xmath99 pb for @xmath100 tev which does look promising for the signal with large enough luminosities at the lhc .",
    "we must point out that we have not incorporated any efficiency factors for our final state particles .",
    "most notably , all numerical estimates involving @xmath2-jets for signal as well as the sm background will have to be scaled with the @xmath2-tagging efficiency of around 50 - 60% expected at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have proposed a new extension of the sm , by introducing a hidden @xmath101 symmetry .",
    "the difference with the previously studied @xmath101 s is that all the sm particles are singlets under our proposed new @xmath101 , and hence hidden .",
    "such a symmetry may be present at the tev scale , and may manifest at the lhc giving new signals observable at the lhc . the model incorporates a new ew singlet higgs , as well as new vector - like charge @xmath102 quarks .",
    "we have studied the pair productions of these new quarks and their subsequent decays .",
    "the dominant final states include multiple @xmath2 jets with high @xmath3 , or @xmath2 jets plus charged leptons with high @xmath3 and missing energy , and stands out beyond the sm background .",
    "the most distinctive final state signal is the @xmath88 quark with high @xmath3 and no missing energy .",
    "a lot of effort have been put in both for the atlas and cms detectors to improve the @xmath2-tagging efficiency .",
    "so the calculation for this @xmath88 final state is also of great importance in the sm , and has not yet been calculated .",
    "we have calculated this @xmath88 signal in our model , and have also estimated the sm expectation using madgraph and madevent .",
    "we found that the signal in our model stands well above that expected from the sm .",
    "we thank t.  stelzer and f.  maltoni for several useful communications regarding the madgraph and madevent package .",
