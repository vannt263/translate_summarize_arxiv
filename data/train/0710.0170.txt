    "a higher dimensional scenario with a warped geometry has been proposed to solve the hierarchy problem by randall - sundrum @xcite . in the scenario ,",
    "all scales except for the scale of gravity are reduced to the weak scale by a warped factor . according to this scenario",
    ", various attempts have been made to construct realistic models @xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum have also proposed a mechanism to localize gravity in the vicinity of a brane @xcite which has attracted enormous attention @xcite .    in constructing realistic models with extra dimensions ,",
    "the spectrum of light kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes becomes important if those masses are accessible to future collider experiments .",
    "thus , it will be worthwhile investigating what are characteristic features of the 4d spectrum of kk modes coming from extra dimensions . a related subject to study",
    "is to clarify the cancellation mechanism of divergences in loop corrections .",
    "mass corrections to extra components of gauge fields are found to be finite at least at one - loop order .",
    "the finiteness is very important because finite quantities can be considered to be predictions of higher - dimensional theories though they will not be renormalizable .",
    "the cancellation of would - be divergences has not been , however , understood fully yet . in a 4-dimensional point of view , the cancellation of divergences seems to be mysterious because it occurs only after _ all _ massive kk modes are taken into account . if we truncate massive kk modes at some energy , the cancellation becomes incomplete .",
    "furthermore , the cancellation still occurs even when gauge symmetries are broken via orbifolding , the hosotani mechanism , or boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , it would be of great importance to reveal nontrivial structure hidden in the spectrum of kk modes and interactions between them .",

    "to this end , let us recall linearized general coordinate transformations in terms of the kk modes : @xmath225 here , we have expanded the gauge parameters @xmath226 and @xmath227 as @xmath228 it follows that we can take the unitary gauge @xmath229 with the choice @xmath230 we should note that the zero mode @xmath231 can not be gauged away and is physical .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the physical degrees of freedom are given by @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) and @xmath234 ; @xmath235 is a massless graviton , @xmath234 is a real massless scalar that is called a radion , and @xmath232 ( @xmath236 ) are the massive gravitons that can become massive by eating the unphysical modes @xmath237 and @xmath238 ( @xmath236 ) .    an alternative way to obtain the physical degrees of freedom",
    "is to rewrite the quadratic action into the following simple form @xmath239 where @xmath240    it is now clear that the action ( without gauge fixing ) depends only on the fields @xmath241 ( @xmath233 ) and @xmath231 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath241 ( @xmath236 ) and @xmath231 are invariant under the general coordinate transformations and hence they are physical degrees of freedom .",
    "the zero mode @xmath242 is not invariant under the transformation because the action remains invariant under the 4d general coordinate transformations .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the 5d gravity theory with the randall - sundrum background metric without taking any gauge fixing and shown that the 4d spectrum is governed by two @xmath0 supersymmetric quantum - mechanical systems .",
    "the @xmath0 supersymmetric structure is expected to be a common feature in any theories with local symmetries .    in section [ sec:5dgauge ]",

    "the supersymmetry between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ensures a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath244 and @xmath237 .",
    "thus , the origin of the two @xmath0 supersymmetric structures lies in the higher - dimensional general coordinate invariance .",
    "it should be emphasized that the full supersymmetry is lost if unphysical degrees of freedom are removed from the spectrum .",
    "we have discussed the boundary conditions from a supersymmetric point of view and succeeded to derive the allowed boundary conditions compatible with the supersymmetry , which are consistent with those obtained from a geometrical point of view @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to point out the difference of the allowed boundary conditions between the 5d gauge and the 5d gravity theories . in the 5d gauge theory",
    "there are four types of the allowed boundary conditions .",
    "if we choose any boundary conditions other than the type ( n , n ) , the 4d gauge symmetry is broken because no massless 4d vector appears , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . on the other hand , in the 5d gravity theory",
    "there is only a unique set of the boundary conditions , for which a massless graviton and a massless scalar appear .",

    "furthermore , a pair of @xmath247 form a supersymmetry multiplet in another @xmath0 supersymmetric one .",
    "we then expect that the two @xmath0 supersymmetric systems would be embedded in a system with some extension of the @xmath0 supersymmetry",
    ". the extension can not be , however , the standard @xmath248-extended one because the number of the degeneracy between `` bosonic '' and `` fermionic '' degrees of freedom is necessarily even .",
    "we have discussed two possible extensions @xcite @xcite .",
    "an interesting fact is that both of them are nonlinear extensions of the @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra .",
    "it would be of great interest to explore possible extensions of the standard supersymmetry .    although the quantum - mechanical supersymmetry is shown to exist in the 4d spectrum",
    ", it does not imply that the theory possesses the supersymmetry because we have not shown that the action is indeed invariant under some supersymmetry transformations .",
    "interestingly , in @xcite , by taking the @xmath249-gauge the quadratic action of the 5d gravity theory has been shown to be invariant under transformations that are closely related to the supersymmetry found in this paper .",
    "it is , however , unclear that the invariance preserves in the full action .",
