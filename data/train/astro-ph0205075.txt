    "h1504 + 65 is an optically faint blue star .",
    "it has been identified as the counterpart of a bright soft x - ray source ( nousek et al .",
    "1986 ) that was discovered by an early x - ray survey ( nugent et al .  1983 ) .",
    "spectroscopically , the star is a member of the pg1159 class , which comprises hot hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars ( @xmath0=75000k180000k , @xmath1=5.58 ; werner 2001 ) .",
    "the pg1159 stars are probably the outcome of a late helium - shell flash , a phenomenon that drives the currently observed fast evolutionary rates of three well - know objects ( fg  sge , sakurai s object , v605 aql )",
    ". a late helium - shell flash may occur in a post - agb star or a white dwarf , and brings the star back onto the agb .",
    "flash induced mixing generates a h - deficient surface layer and the subsequent second post - agb evolution explains the existence of wolf - rayet central stars of planetary nebulae and their successors , the pg1159 stars ( see also the review of schnberner & jeffery in these proceedings ) . within the pg1159 group h1504 + 65 is an extraordinary object , as it has been shown that h1504 + 65 is not only hydrogen - deficient but also helium - deficient . from optical spectra",
    "it was concluded that the atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon and oxygen , by equal amounts ( werner 1991 ) .",
    "neon lines were detected in soft x - ray spectra taken with the euve satellite and in an optical - uv keck spectrum and an abundance of ne=25% ( all abundances in this paper are given as mass fractions ) was derived ( werner & wolff 1999 ) .",
    "we present here first results of new observations performed with fuse and chandra , whose spectroscopic resolution is more than an order of magnitude better than that of previous fuv and euv missions ( hut and euve ) .",
    "synthetic spectra were computed with a nlte code ( werner & dreizler 1999 ) which constructs line blanketed , static , plane parallel model atmospheres .",
    "h1504 + 65 was observed with fuse on jan .  28 , 2002 , with an integration time of 10.7 hours",
    ". the spectral range covered was 9121188  with a resolution of about 0.1 .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by a few broad photospheric lines of civ and ovi and many narrow interstellar lines , predominantly from h@xmath2 .",
    "two interesting details are shown in fig.[fuse ] .",
    "the left panel is centered around the location of a heii line .",
    "it is clearly seen that no heii absorption is detectable and a comparison with models shows that the helium abundance is at most of the order of 1% .",
    "this confirms the results from a less reliable optical analysis , which was entirely based on the lack of a heii  4686  emission line ( werner 1991 ) , and from hut spectroscopy ( kruk & werner 1998 ) .",
    "the right panel is centered around the ovi resonance doublet .",
    "the observed profile shows no evidence for on - going mass - loss and hence can be fitted with a synthetic profile of a static model .",
    "this will allow the derivation of an upper limit for the mass - loss rate from which one can determine the significance of mass - loss for the cooling rate and the surface chemical composition .",
    "=    [ ht ] =    [ !",
    "ht ] =    h1504 + 65 was observed with chandra on sep .",
    "27 , 2000 , with an integration time of 7 hours .",
    "flux was detected in the range 60160  and the spectral resolution is about 0.1 .",
    "fig.[chandra ] shows the overall spectrum .",
    "it is characterized by a roll - off at long wavelengths due to ism absorption .",
    "the maximum flux is detected near 110 .",
    "between 105  and 100  the flux drops because of absorption from the ovi edge of the first excited atomic level .",
    "the edge is not sharp because of a converging line series and pressure ionization ( see werner & wolff , 1999 , for detailed model spectra ) .",
    "below 100  the flux decreases , representing the wien tail of the photospheric flux distribution .",
    "fig.[chandra ] demonstrates that current models can not fit the entire wavelength range at a unique temperature , so that @xmath0 can only be constrained between 175000k and 200000k . at present",
    "we favor the higher value , because the excess model flux at 100120  can be explained by missing opacities from iron group elements , as exploratory calculations have shown .",
    "also , a detailed inspection of the relative strengths of mgvi and mgvii lines favors the higher temperature .",
    "figs.[chandra_109 ] and [ chandra_80 ] display astonishing details in the chandra spectrum . at first sight",
    "the spectrum appears to be rather noisy , but comparison with model spectra suggests that most absorption features in the observation , which are not yet fitted with current models , are probably real .",
    "magnesium lines are discovered for the first time in h1504 + 65 , which however becomes only clear by comparison with modeling with a very detailed mg model atom ( see in particular fig.[chandra_80 ] , top panel ) .",
    "it comprises more than 120 nlte levels and 130 individual lines in the chandra spectral range .",
    "it is worth mentioning that fine structure splitting of the metal lines can be detected in the observed spectra down to a separation of only 0.1  and requires such detailed modeling . designing the respective model atoms",
    "is cumbersome because atomic data from different sources needs to be collected .",
    "energy levels are obtained from either bashkin & stoner ( 1975 ) or the nist database .",
    "oscillator strengths are taken from topbase , the opacity project ( op ) database ( seaton et al .",
    "whenever possible , bound - free cross - sections for atomic levels are also taken from topbase , but in some cases hydrogen - like approximations are necessary .",
    "a problem is posed by strong resonances in the op photoionization data .",
    "they are responsible for some strong , absorption line - like features in the computed spectra .",
    "their exact wavelength location is , however , uncertain because the data are results from ab - initio calculations yielding inaccurate energy levels .",
    "collisional rates are computed by usual formulae which employ radiative cross - sections as far as possible .",
    "as already mentioned , we have computed exploratory models including opacities of heavy metals ( ca  ni ) .",
    "this introduces a very large number of additional lines which effectively block flux in the 100120  region and thus may eventually lead to a unique temperature determination .",
    "however , identifying individual heavy metal lines will be problematic , because the vast majority of lines in the available lists ( kurucz 1994 ) have uncertain wavelength positions .",
    "from our first models presented here , the magnesium abundance is of the order 2% , similar to the ne abundance determined earlier .",
    "this allows two alternative interpretations .",
    "either we see a naked c / o white dwarf with 3@xmath3 processed matter , which is , according to evolutionary models , dominated by c and o with an admixture of @xmath4ne and @xmath5 mg of the order 1% ( e.g. iben & tutukov 1985 ) . or we see a naked o - ne - mg white dwarf which has undergone carbon burning .",
    "a comparison with the respective evolutionary models ( ritossa et al .  1999 ) suggests that we could look onto such a naked remnant where @xmath6ne and a mixture of several mg isotopes ( @xmath7mg,@xmath5mg,@xmath8 mg ) should be present .",
    "we have already speculated earlier , that the onset of c burning and subsequent evolutionary processes might explain the uniqueness of h1504 + 65 . in order to confirm this idea",
    ", we will also look for sodium absorption lines , because the stellar models also predict a relatively high amount of @xmath9na in this case .",
    "to conclude , h1504 + 65 might have been one of the `` heavyweight '' intermediate - mass stars ( 9m@xmath10 11m@xmath11 ) which form white dwarfs with electron - degenerate o - ne - mg cores resulting from carbon burning .",
    "this speculation is corroborated by the fact that h1504 + 65 is one of the most massive pg1159 stars known ( 0.86@xmath120.15m@xmath13 ) .",
