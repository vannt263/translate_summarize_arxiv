    "in this work we introduce the prioritising exclusion process ( pep ) : a stochastic scheduling mechanism for a priority queue , where high priority customers overtake low priority customers in order to receive service sooner .",
    "the queue of customers is represented by a one dimensional lattice , which grows and shrinks as customers arrive and are served .",
    "lattice sites are either empty or occupied by a single particle , representing low and high priority customers respectively ; particles hop forwards stochastically into empty sites , corresponding to a high priority customer overtaking the low priority customer immediately ahead of them , but the _ exclusion rule _ prevents particles hopping into or over occupied sites .",
    "the pep is closely related to a priority queuing model first introduced by kleinrock @xcite , and the subject of more recent work @xcite .",
    "priority queueing systems are relevant in healthcare applications , both as a way to efficiently manage hospital queues with patients of differing urgency @xcite , and to describe actual practise in emergency rooms@xcite .",
    "the hopping and exclusion in the pep is analogous to that of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite , which is one of the most thoroughly studied and central models of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the tasep is a microscopic model of a driven system @xcite , and has been the focus of much mathematical interest due to the fact that it is integrable .",
    "many tools have been applied to or developed for the tasep .",
    "its exact stationary distribution is known @xcite and can be written in matrix product form @xcite .",
    "its dynamic properties are studied by means of the bethe ansatz @xcite and for the infinite lattice powerful techniques from random matrix theory are available @xcite .",
    "domain wall theory @xcite provides a phenomenological explanation of the stationary behaviour of the tasep .",
    "domain wall theory is amenable to generalisation to more complicated models that may not be integrable , and we will describe it in more detail later .    recently , several generalisations of the tasep have been proposed , which allow the lattice length to vary dynamically as is the case in the pep .",
    "such models are of theoretical interest in statistical physics as they are grand - canonical analogues of the tasep .",
    "the review @xcite highlights many biological applications , such as modelling filament growth @xcite and length regulation @xcite .",
    "there have been applications to queueing theory as well . the exclusive queueing process ( eqp ) @xcite uses an exclusion process to model the motion of customers waiting in a queue . in the eqp , customers ( all of a single priority class )",
    "are represented by particles , with empty lattice sites for the space between them .",
    "the hopping of particles represents customers shuffling forwards as space becomes available . beyond applications , these models are also of interest because of the rich phase structure the varying lattice length introduces @xcite .    as is typical of a queueing system , the pep has a phase transition from a phase with finite expected queue length , to one with an _ unbounded _ queue length increasing with time .",
    "this transition occurs when the rate of arrival of customers exceeds the service rate . in the latter case",
    ", we treat the lattice as infinite in length in order to study the late time limit .",
    "the pep has a natural domain wall structure , and the domain wall dynamics can be derived directly from the microscopic transition rules , similarly to @xcite . in the unbounded phase , in the infinite lattice limit",
    ", the solution of the domain wall equations gives exact local density profiles .",
    "the domain wall solution reveals a second phase transition where the ` jam ' of high priority customers waiting at the service end becomes infinite .",
    "when the expected lattice length remains finite ( the _ bounded _ phase ) , the domain wall theory leads to approximate solutions only , but the structure from the unbounded phase carries over .",
    "we see a remnant of the jamming transition from the unbounded phase as a crossover where the jam of high priority customers at the service end delocalises , and the expected jam length becomes comparable to the queue length . then by defining ` aggregated correlation functions ' , we find that the form of the unbounded solution can be applied in the bounded phase as an alternative to mean field theory , giving a very accurate calculation of customer waiting times",
    ".      in the lattice bulk , the pep behaves as a tasep : sites are either occupied by a single particle or empty , and particles hop forwards into empty sites with rate @xmath0 .",
    "at the boundaries the pep differs from the tasep",
    ". the pep lattice can be extended on the left by the addition of a filled or empty lattice site , with rates @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . at the other boundary , the rightmost site is removed with rate @xmath3 , irrespective of its occupation .",
    "these rules , summarised in figure  [ fig : queuerules ] , allow both the lattice length and particle number to vary .",
    "we specify a pep configuration by binary variables @xmath4 with @xmath5 for a filled site and @xmath6 for an empty site .",
    "usually we will number sites from right to left and write a length @xmath7 configuration as @xmath8      the pep can be interpreted as a priority queueing system with two classes of customers .",
    "the lattice , itself , is the queue of customers , with filled sites representing high priority customers ( class @xmath9 ) and empty sites representing low priority customers ( class @xmath10 ) .",
    "the rates @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the arrival rates of high and low priority customers respectively , and the rate @xmath3 , is the rate at which customers are served and leave the queue .    in this interpretation",
    ", a particle hopping forward one site corresponds to a high priority customer stepping ahead of the low priority customer immediately in front of them .",
    "the stochastic overtaking is the scheduling mechanism in this priority queue , giving high priority customers preferential treatment over low priority",
    ". the larger the overtake rate @xmath0 , the greater the advantage .",
    "the pep is modelled on a well studied priority queueing system introduced by kleinrock @xcite and now known as the accumulating priority queue ( apq ) @xcite . in the apq , customers have a priority value which accumulates linearly with time .",
    "class @xmath9 customers accumulate priority faster than class @xmath10 , thus overtaking them in the service queue .",
    "the key difference between the apq and the pep is that , for a given sequence of arrivals , overtaking in the apq is deterministic , but in the pep the overtakes occur stochastically .",
    "the pep is also related to a simpler queueing system , the @xmath11 queue ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the total arrival rate of customers to the pep is @xmath12 , and the service rate is @xmath3 .",
    "both these rates are independent of the internal arrangement of the queue , and the prioritising parameter @xmath0 .",
    "so , if we are interested only in the total length of the queue , we can treat the system as a @xmath11 queue with arrival rate @xmath13 and service rate @xmath3 .",
    "the state of a @xmath11 queue is characterised simply by the length , @xmath7 , with probability distribution @xmath14 obeying the master equation @xmath15 the stationary length distribution of the @xmath11 queue ( and hence for the pep ) is the solution of @xmath16 , which is @xmath17 when @xmath18 , i.e. when the total arrival rate is less than the service rate . in this case",
    "the system is described as _ stable _ , because the queue length does not grow without bound .",
    "the expected queue length is finite , given by @xmath19 we will call this the _ bounded _ phase of the pep .",
    "when @xmath20 , the system is _ unstable _ and the expected queue length grows as @xmath21 in the late time limit , we can treat the queue as infinite in length .",
    "we call this the _ unbounded _ phase of the pep .    at the special value @xmath22 ,",
    "the pep really does reduce to a @xmath11 queue .",
    "customers arriving at rate @xmath13 are high priority with probability @xmath23 or low priority with probability @xmath24 .",
    "but as there is no overtaking , there is no reordering of customers , and no advantage in being a class @xmath9 customer .",
    "the probability of high or low at any site is the same as at arrival , i.e. @xmath25 or @xmath24 , respectively . in the bounded phase ,",
    "the probability of the length @xmath7 configuration @xmath26 is then @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of high priority customers , and @xmath29 the number of low priority customers , i.e. @xmath30    we can contrast the phase behaviour of the pep with that of the eqp , where the length of the lattice is defined by the position of the last customer , and so the lattice length depends on how fast customers step into the space ahead of them ( i.e. the particle hopping rate ) .",
    "the eqp has bounded and unbounded length phases , but with phase boundaries dependent on the hopping rate @xcite .      to define a density profile for the pep we must specify both the site , @xmath31 , and the lattice length , @xmath7 , so that @xmath32 these are one - point functions .",
    "we can similarly define higher order correlations @xmath33    the rate equations for the one - point functions are @xmath34 these couple the one - point functions to the two - point correlations , and length @xmath7 to length @xmath35 .",
    "the rate equations imply a conserved current of particles across the lattice , but because of the coupling between lengths , some care is required in how this current is defined .",
    "we will return to this for the bounded and unbounded phases separately .",
    "viewing the pep as a queueing system , we are interested in performance measures , and how these differ for high and low priority customers .",
    "the current tells us the rate at which customers pass through the system , and from the density profile we can calculate the average waiting time for customers of each class .    to calculate waiting times",
    ", we use little s result ( see chapter 2.1 of @xcite ) , which states that the average waiting time , @xmath36 , is related to the average number of waiting customers , @xmath37 , for each class @xmath38 , by @xmath39 the average number of high priority customers can be calculated from the density profile as @xmath40 and the average number of low priority customers is @xmath41 here we take the total time from arrival to removal from the system as the waiting time for a customer .",
    "our aim , now , is to compute the density profile for the pep .",
    "domain wall theory @xcite reduces the multi - particle dynamics of the tasep to the motion of a single random walker on the lattice .",
    "the tasep boundary conditions ( the particle entry and exit rates ) create domains of low or high density at the boundaries .",
    "these domains extend through the lattice , and where they meet a shock , or domain wall , forms .",
    "domain wall theory models the motion of this shock as a random walk , with the simplifying assumptions that density is constant throughout each domain , and that there is a sharp transition between domains so that the shock can be localised to a single site . though the stationary solution of the tasep is known exactly , domain wall theory provides a simple physical explanation of the stationary behaviour @xcite , and beyond this it allows accurate approximation of some dynamic properties @xcite .",
    "domain wall theory can also be applied to more complex models @xcite where the exact solution is not known . for the eqp",
    ", a domain wall approach was used to describe the global density profile in the divergent length ( i.e. unbounded ) phase @xcite . in @xcite domain wall theory provided an exact solution and we will show that this also occurs in the unbounded phase of the pep .",
    "the pep has a natural domain wall structure .",
    "as high priority customers overtake and reach the service end , they form a jam ( figure [ fig : jam ] ) : a jam is a section of high priority customers ( filled sites ) at the service end ahead of any low priority customer ( empty site ) .",
    "the jam is characterised by @xmath42 , the number of consecutive high priority customers .",
    "as there are no gaps , there is no overtaking in the jammed region , and the length of the jam reduces only as customers are served .",
    "this is similar to the situation in @xcite , where a tasep with parallel update and deterministic bulk motion is considered . in @xcite ,",
    "a jam of particles was suggested as the cause of a reduced effective lattice length in the reverse bias regime of the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "let us assume that the region beyond the jam has uniform density , and that the conditional probability that site @xmath31 is filled , given the queue length , @xmath7 , and jam length , @xmath42 , is ( figure  [ fig : dwprob ] ) @xmath43 then the bulk equation ( @xmath44 ) for @xmath45 , the probability of a length @xmath42 jam in a length @xmath7 queue , is @xmath46    let us explain the meaning of each of the terms in equation .",
    "the term @xmath47 is the entry into the @xmath48 configuration from a length @xmath7 queue due to the arrival of a customer , and the terms @xmath49 represent the service of a customer .",
    "the second term is the transition into the @xmath42-jam state from the @xmath50-jam state by the service of a low priority customer who was followed by @xmath42 consecutive high priority customers .",
    "the term @xmath51 is a @xmath52-jam extending to length @xmath42 with rate @xmath53 : there is a high priority customer at site @xmath54 with probability @xmath55 , which overtakes with rate @xmath0 the low priority customer at site @xmath42 ( the low priority customer marking the end of the @xmath52-jam ) .",
    "the low priority customer thus moves to position @xmath56 defining the new end of the jam .",
    "the loss terms @xmath57 are the rate at which the @xmath48 configuration is left due to a customer arrival or service , or growth of the jam .    in the next section",
    ", we will show that the @xmath58 limit of , and the corresponding equation for @xmath59 , follows from the unbounded phase master equation .",
    "we find the exact stationary solutions of these equations , describing the behaviour of the jam on an infinite lattice .",
    "in the bounded phase ( section  [ sec : bounded_phase ] ) , domain wall theory leads to two complementary approximations .",
    "one reveals information about the length dependence and the other about waiting times .",
    "we consider first the unbounded phase of the pep , where the total arrival rate exceeds the service rate ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "recall that the expected lattice length grows as @xmath61 . in our domain wall picture",
    ", the jam increases with rate @xmath53 and decreases with rate @xmath3 ( ignoring for the moment the @xmath62 term in ) . if @xmath63 , the jam will grow as @xmath64 unless it reaches the arrival end of the queue , but if @xmath65 , the jam length will fluctuate near @xmath66 .",
    "figure  [ fig : unbounded_evolution ] shows simulation results for a growing jam ( figure  [ fig : unbounded_unbounded_time ] ) , and a jam fluctuating near @xmath66 ( figure  [ fig : unbounded_bounded_time ] ) .",
    "the figures show the time evolution of the density profile , starting from an empty queue , with the density at each site calculated by averaging over a short time period .",
    "the queue length grows with rate @xmath67 , and the low density region beyond the jam of high priority customers is fairly regular .",
    "we will focus on the situation in figure  [ fig : unbounded_bounded_time ] , where the jam length remains finite . in figure",
    "[ fig : unbounded_unbounded_time ] where the jam grows , we see that it nevertheless grows more slowly than the queue length , and we will comment on this later .",
    "we would like to understand the late time behaviour in the unbounded phase , but as for any fixed configuration @xmath26 , @xmath68 the _ global _ description is uninformative .",
    "instead , we follow the approach of @xcite and consider _ local _ behaviour relative to a specified reference frame .    the _ service frame _ is fixed at the right hand end of the lattice where customers are served and depart . for a general but finite section of length @xmath69 , @xmath70 the service frame probability in a length @xmath7 lattice",
    "is defined as @xmath71 we will also consider the _ arrival frame _ , fixed at the left hand end of the lattice . in this case",
    "we number sites left to right .",
    "a general length @xmath69 section is written @xmath72 and the arrival frame probability in a length @xmath7 lattice is defined by @xmath73    in the @xmath74 limit , the expected lattice length is infinite , and thus we are interested in the @xmath58 limits @xmath75 with the assumption that this limit exists .",
    "we will write the rate equations for the arrival and service frame probabilities in this limit , then seek the stationary solution . to do this",
    ", we use a domain wall ansatz for , and show that this leads to the exact stationary solution for these quantities .",
    "we use domain wall theory to form an ansatz for the service frame probabilities .",
    "we consider a general but finite section of length @xmath69 , with a length @xmath42 jam , @xmath76 where @xmath77 indicates a string of @xmath42 @xmath9 s .",
    "the configuration of any finite segment can be written this way , as long as we can take @xmath78 .",
    "we will assume that the conditional probability for a high at site @xmath31 given a jam of length @xmath42 is @xmath79 which is in the @xmath58 limit .",
    "then the probability of the finite segment is @xmath80 where @xmath28 is the number of highs in the configuration beyond the jam up to position @xmath69 , and @xmath29 is the number of lows , that is @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the probability of a length @xmath42 jam .",
    "the jam probabilities are normalised such that @xmath83 equation is the domain wall ansatz for the stationary service frame probabilities .      in this section",
    "we write the general service frame rate equations , then apply the domain wall ansatz .",
    "we use the notation @xmath84 to indicate the exchange of customers in places @xmath31 and @xmath85 .",
    "that is , for @xmath86 @xmath87 and @xmath88    the stationary rate equation for the @xmath42-jam configuration with @xmath89 is @xmath90 let us again explain the various terms .",
    "the terms @xmath91 give the rate of arrival to the @xmath42-jam configuration after , respectively , a high or low priority customer is served .",
    "then there are the hopping terms . a high in @xmath69th place in @xmath92",
    "can arrive from place @xmath93 : @xmath94 overtaking within the low density region behind the jam is given by @xmath95 and a @xmath52-jam extends to a @xmath42-jam when a high hops onto the end : @xmath96 the loss term @xmath97 is the reduction of the jam as a customer is served , and @xmath98 are overtakings within the @xmath69 places of @xmath92 .",
    "the final loss term @xmath99 arises if the configuration has a low in @xmath69th place , which can be overtaken by a high from place @xmath100 .",
    "finally we note that the terms involving the arrival rates @xmath101 and @xmath102 do not appear in as they cancel from the stationary rate equations in the @xmath103 limit .    substituting the ansatz ,",

    "cancelling , and simplifying leaves @xmath107 this agrees with the @xmath58 limit of , but we have derived it from the full pep rate equations .",
    "were it not for the @xmath108 term , this equation for the position of the jam would have the same form as the domain wall theory for the tasep @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59 case differs only slightly . in this case",
    "the rate equation is @xmath109 substituting the ansatz , this reduces to @xmath110 and rearranging gives @xmath111 with this as the base case , we use to show by induction that @xmath112 this recurrence for @xmath82 has solution @xmath113 the normalisation condition fixes @xmath114 subject to the constraint @xmath115    the domain wall picture makes the meaning of this constraint clear .",
    "the jam of high priority customers grows with rate @xmath53 and is reduced with rate @xmath3 . if @xmath63 the jam grows with rate @xmath116 , that is @xmath117 and as @xmath74 the expected length of the jam becomes infinite .",
    "in contrast , when is satisfied , the service rate is fast enough to prevent a backlog of high priority customers , and the expected jam length is finite and given by @xmath118      to determine @xmath55 , we examine the pep in the arrival frame .",
    "sites are now numbered left to right , and the interchange operation is defined as @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "we will assume that the jam is always far from the arrival end .",
    "in the late time limit this is guaranteed if @xmath121 this condition is clearly met when is satisfied , but we will show that @xmath55 can be determined consistently with this requirement . then in the arrival frame , the ansatz implies that for a configuration on the first @xmath69 sites , @xmath122 the arrival frame probability has the form @xmath123 where @xmath124    the stationary rate equation for this configuration is @xmath125 substituting , the summed hopping terms again combine and telescope , and the factors of @xmath55 and @xmath126 common to all terms can be cancelled .",
    "this leaves @xmath127 which for both @xmath128 and @xmath129 reduces to @xmath130 the two solutions are @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 . as @xmath55 is a density value we must take @xmath135 . substituting this value for @xmath55",
    ", it is seen that @xmath136 ( the constraint ) is satisfied for all physical parameter values .",
    "the jam always grows more slowly than the queue length , as illustrated by the simulation results in figure  [ fig : unbounded_unbounded_time ] . in the limit @xmath137 , @xmath138 , the expected occupancy of any site when",
    "there is no overtaking .    with @xmath55 given by , and the jam probabilities , @xmath82 by and",

    "we have solved the bulk equations in the domain wall approximation , giving the solution in the form , which with and results in @xmath205 in general this solution does not satisfy the boundary equations for @xmath206 , i.e. the cases we neglected were where the jam extends to the length of the queue .",
    "the jam grows with rate @xmath53 , so the constraint @xmath136 ( equation arising from the normalisation condition ) requires that the queue length grows faster on average then the jam .",
    "since we have totally neglected the boundary equations , we expect our approximation to be best when @xmath207 .",
    "in fact when @xmath137 reduces to @xmath208 as expected from the exact solution in this case , .",
    "the density at site @xmath31 in a length @xmath7 queue , computed from , is @xmath209 figure  [ fig : lengthdep_density ] shows length dependent density profiles for @xmath136 ( figure  [ fig : lengthdep_dw ] ) and @xmath210 ( figure  [ fig : lengthdep_nondw ] ) , scaled by dividing out the length distribution @xmath14 .",
    "triangle markers show simulation results , with points for each length connected by dashed lines .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lengthdep_dw ] , the solid curve shows @xmath211 calculated from and .",
    "we see that as @xmath7 increases , the simulation results converge to the calculated profile , and even for @xmath212 the match is very good . in figure",
    "[ fig : lengthdep_nondw ] , where the solution no longer applies , the profiles become almost linear and are reminiscent of the behaviour of the tasep on the coexistence line . in that phase ,",
    "the domain wall occurs at all positions with equal probability , resulting , on average , in a linear profile @xcite . in the bounded pep",
    "the evidence suggests that the constraint @xmath136 marks a crossover between the localised jam , for @xmath136 and the delocalised jam for @xmath210 .      in this section",
    "we take a different approach , working with the rate equations for the one - point functions .",
    "we start by defining a conserved current for the bounded phase .",
    "to do so , we sum the density at each position over all lengths , thus aggregating the effect of the length fluctuations .",
    "define the summed one - point functions @xmath213 note that as @xmath214 , @xmath215 so the sum is bounded , and it converges as @xmath216 is monotone increasing in @xmath217 .",
    "thus @xmath218 is well defined .",
    "higher order summed correlations are defined similarly , e.g. @xmath219    summing the rate equations  gives @xmath220 these can be written as a conservation equation for three currents @xmath221 where @xmath222 @xmath223 is the site - to - site current with a hopping term and frame current term . but",
    "customers can also step directly into place at the end of the queue , which gives the external current @xmath224 .    in the stationary distribution",
    "the time derivatives are zero , and so gives a recurrence for the site - to - site current @xmath225 which reduces to @xmath226 we have @xmath227 , as both terms on the right hand side of go to zero .",
    "therefore implies that @xmath228 and @xmath229 now tells us that @xmath230 this result is exact ",
    "it is the probability that the lattice is at least length one with a particle in site @xmath9 .",
    "we could have derived this result directly from the notion of the pep as a queue : high priority customers leave the system at an average rate @xmath231 .",
    "the rate at which high priority customers leave the system can not be higher than @xmath1 , the rate they arrive .",
    "but as the service capacity exceeds the total arrival rate ( @xmath12 ) there is no bottleneck at the server , so high priority customers leave at the rate they arrive , that is @xmath232 .",
    "the presence of two - point correlations prevent us from calculating exact densities for @xmath233 , etc .",
    "the mean field method @xcite is the standard way to deal with this , assuming the correlation between neighbouring sites is small so that the two - point correlations can be approximated as products of the one - point functions . but for the pep , there is a similarity to the unbounded system , which we can exploit to solve the one - point rate equations .    by the definition , @xmath218 is the probability @xmath234 we can instead work with the conditional probability @xmath235 the two are related by @xmath236 similarly , define @xmath237 through @xmath238 substituting into , gives @xmath239 these have the same form as the current equations for the unbounded queue , , with an effective current @xmath240 so are solved by the unbounded queue one- and two - point functions , .",
    "that is @xmath241 and @xmath242 to determine @xmath55 , we substitute , into , and take @xmath243 ( assuming @xmath65 ) .",
    "this gives back the quadratic for @xmath55 , so we again must take @xmath135 , given by . note",
    "that @xmath65 if @xmath244 , so the density profile is always exponentially decaying .",
    "this solution satisfies the current equation , and therefore the resulting aggregated one- and two - point functions , satisfy the one - point rate equations , .",
    "but as it does not in general satisfy the higher order rate equations it is approximate only .",
    "figure  [ fig : density_aggregated ] compares simulated and calculated aggregated density profiles , @xmath218 .",
    "we have divided out the length dependence factor @xmath245 so in fact are plotting @xmath246 computed from .",
    "we see that at @xmath247 , where the exact value @xmath248 is known , and asymptotically for large @xmath31 , the simulated and calculated density profiles agree . at intermediate values of @xmath31",
    "we see the greatest discrepancy , indicating that the aggregated domain wall solution is approximate only , although the agreement is still very good .",
    "note we could also compare the aggregated profiles with @xmath249 summed over @xmath7 .",
    "however , even at position @xmath9 the summed @xmath250 does not agree with @xmath251 for which the exact result is known .",
    "the direct application of the domain wall ansatz in section  [ sec : boundeddw ] gave an indication of the length dependence in the system , but the approach in this section , following from the current conservation equation , is in much better agreement numerically with simulation results .",
    "we can use the aggregated one - point functions to compute the average number of customers in the queue , and in turn the average waiting times for both classes of customers . switching the order of the sums in ,",
    "we can write @xmath252 , the average number of high priority customers , as @xmath253 substituting , into , little s result gives the average high priority waiting time , @xmath254 with , the average low priority waiting time is @xmath255    though , come from an approximate solution , in the @xmath137 and @xmath256 limits they give the correct waiting times . taking first the limit @xmath137 , we find @xmath257 with @xmath22 , high and low priority customers are treated identically",
    ". the pep reduces to a @xmath11 queue with arrival rate @xmath13 and service rate @xmath3 , for which the average waiting time is as given by .",
    "conversely , if we make the overtake rate infinite , then high priority customers arriving at the queue will immediately overtake any waiting low priority customers . in this limit ,",
    "high priority customers see an @xmath11 queue with arrival rate @xmath1 and service rate @xmath3 , and indeed we find @xmath258 the average waiting time for low priority customers is @xmath259 this can be found by directly taking the limit , or via the requirement that @xmath260 .",
    "figure  [ fig : waiting_times ] shows @xmath261 , @xmath262 plotted as a function @xmath0 .",
    "again we see good agreement between simulation results and the calculated values .    increasing @xmath0 interpolates between a first come first served queue ( @xmath22 ) and strict prioritisation according to customer class ( @xmath256 ) . in designing a queueing system",
    ", one would choose @xmath0 to give the desired high priority waiting time , within the constraints imposed by the asymptotic limits .",
    "the greatest response in @xmath261 , defined as the maximum value of @xmath263 , occurs at @xmath22 in figure  [ fig : waiting_times_low_density ] , and so there is a strong relative benefit to high priority customers using even small values of @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : waiting_times_high_density ] the value of the parameters give rise to an inflection point at @xmath264 , and hence the largest response in @xmath261 occurs at some positive value of @xmath0 .",
    "a sufficient condition for such an inflection point to occur . ] is @xmath265 , which happens if and only if @xmath266 then @xmath267 must change sign as @xmath268 . for these values of the parameters",
    "the benefit to high priority customers of switching on @xmath0 is relatively small compared to the penalty for low priority customers .",
    "in this paper we introduce the prioritising exclusion process : a priority queueing model in which high priority customers are allowed to push ahead in the queue , and thus gain their advantage .",
    "the pep is the exclusion process analog of a well studied priority queueing model , the apq , a connection which is interesting in itself .",
    "but the pep also has a natural domain wall structure , which allows domain wall dynamics to be derived from the microscopic transition rules .",
    "this has recently been achieved for a tasep with deterministic bulk motion and stochastic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the pep is fully stochastic , but the unique boundary conditions result in the regular behaviour of the jam of high priority customers , the key descriptor in our domain wall model .",
    "the pep exhibits a phase transition from a phase with finite expected lattice length , to one with an unbounded lattice length . in the unbounded phase",
    ", we find the exact solution of the domain wall equations in the @xmath58 limit , which reveals a further subdivision of this phase into phases with finite or infinite jam length .",
    "we find the condition for an infinite jam , in which case low priority customers will , with probability one , never get served .",
    "when the jam remains finite we calculate exact stationary density profiles in appropriately defined local reference frames .    in the bounded phase",
    ", domain wall theory does not give exact results but leads to two complementary approximate solutions .",
    "from a direct application of the domain wall ansatz we find that the shape of the density profile can again be understood in terms of a jam , in this case either localised at the service end or able to grow and fill the lattice . in a second approach",
    ", a current conservation equation implies that domain wall theory can be naturally applied to aggregate densities .",
    "we thus give very good approximations for these observables and consequently accurately estimate average customer waiting times .",
    "we also give the condition for which the stochastic overtaking of low priority customers is most effective as a scheduling mechanism .",
    "the behaviour of the jam of high priority customers plays a key role in understanding all phases of the pep .",
    "there is an interesting analog in the apq in the notion of _ accredited _ customers : class @xmath9 customers with accumulated priority greater than the maximum possible priority of any class @xmath10 customer @xcite .",
    "this differs from the definition of a jam , since the last accredited customer may be followed by an unaccredited class @xmath9 customer , whereas in the pep , a jam is always terminated by a class 2 ( low priority ) customer .",
    "understanding this connection may allow us to compute complete waiting time distributions for the pep , as has already been done for the apq @xcite .",
    "we thank peter taylor for suggesting the pep to us as well as for discussions , and alexandre lazarescu , chikashi arita , guy latouce , and kirone mallick for discussions and encouragement .",
