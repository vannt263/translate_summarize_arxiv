    "nuclear deformation is one of the unique properties of a finite quantum system .",
    "if the intrinsic wave function shows some deformation , the nuclear radius becomes effectively large because the ground - state wave function is expressed as a superposition of the intrinsic wave functions with different orientations . since the total and interaction cross sections are closely related to the nuclear radius , it is interesting to investigate a relation between these cross sections and nuclear deformation .    in this paper",

    "for example , the total reaction cross sections of @xmath2c+@xmath2c collisions are improved very much in a wide energy range  @xcite .",

    "the computer program employed in the present work has been developed previously for linear - response calculations @xcite , including all the time - odd densities .",
    "however , those time - odd parts automatically vanish in converged self - consistent solutions . because of this simple filling treatment for odd-@xmath1 nuclei , we do not expect a quantitative description of odd - even effect in our calculation . for nuclei",

    "both skm * and sly4 results exhibit similar behavior , except for very neutron - rich isotopes with @xmath56 , in which the neutron separation energy is calculated to be larger for skm * than sly4 .",
    "since a smaller separation energy is expected to produces a larger matter radius , the behavior of the fermi energy or the neutron separation energy does not explain the difference of the calculated matter radii for nuclei with @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ radiinempn.fig ] ) . on the contrary , this gives an opposite effect .",
    "the matter radius is predicted to be larger for the skm * calculation .",

    "[ radiinempn.fig ] .",
    "the matter radii coincide again at @xmath55 , so does the predicted @xmath60 values .",
    "it should be noted that the kink behavior in the matter radii at @xmath65 ( sly4 ) in fig .",
    "[ radiinempn.fig ] can be explained by the onset of the deformation at @xmath56 , while the kink at @xmath66 is due to the occupation of the @xmath67 orbitals at @xmath68 .",
    "the proton number @xmath69 of ne isotope is known to strongly favor the prolate shape , because it corresponds to the magic number at the superdeformation  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the results in fig .",
    "[ betane.fig ] for ne isotopes with @xmath70 .",
    "recent experiments reveal that the excitation energy of the first @xmath71 states @xmath72 in even ne isotopes decrease from @xmath61 to @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the increase of the quadrupole deformation calculated with skm*.    the calculated total reaction cross sections of ne isotopes incident on a @xmath2c target at 240 @xmath1 mev are shown in fig .",

    "the cross section increases gradually from @xmath74 to 14 and shows a rapid rise from @xmath66 .",
    "this neutron - number dependence of the total reaction cross sections also well corresponds to the calculated matter radii .    for the nuclei with @xmath75 , the calculated cross sections are slightly larger than the observed values , while the agreement between the theory and experiment is fairly good in the neutron - rich region beyond @xmath66 .",
    "this may be explained by the difference between the total reaction and interaction cross sections .",
    "the theory gives the total reaction cross section @xmath76 while the experiment is the interaction cross section @xmath77 . since the latter cross section does not contain inelastic reaction cross sections , the inequality @xmath78 always holds .",
    "contributions of the inelastic processes are classified as two cases : ( i ) the projectile nucleus is excited to particle - bound excited states that are located below particle - emission threshold , while the target can take any states .",
    "( ii ) the target nucleus is excited , but the projectile remains in the ground state .",
    "the difference between the total reaction and interaction cross sections is expected to be smaller as going closer to the neutron drip line .",
    "the difference is estimated to be at most 100 mb in a phenomenological way  @xcite .    for the neutron - rich nuclei @xmath79ne",
    ", the results of skm@xmath52 nicely reproduce an average behavior of the experimental cross sections , but not their odd - even staggering",
    ". this may be due to the pairing correlation @xcite , which is neglected in the present study .",
    "our result for these nuclei is similar to the one obtained with the deformed woods - saxon potential @xcite . approaching the neutron dripline",
    ", the neutron separation energy becomes very small .",
    "in such a situation , a spatial extension of the last neutron orbit is very sensitive to the separation energy .",
    "the 3d coordinate - space representation for the single - particle orbitals is suitable for the treatment of their asymptotics .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath4ne , the measured neutron separation energy is only about 0.33 mev with a large error bar  @xcite , while the calculated separation energy is as large as 2 mev with the skm@xmath52 interactions . together with the half - filling approximation",
    ", the present skyrme functionals may not provide us with such a precise description of a loosely bound system . to artificially adjust the fermi level to 300 kev",
    ", we multiply the mean - field potentials ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite ) obtained with skm@xmath52 by a common scaling factor , then , the total reaction cross section is easily increased by 140 mb .",
    "this , in fact , significantly overestimates the experimental cross section .",
    "thus , an accurate measurement of the neutron separation energy is highly desired .",
    "figure  [ densne.fig ] presents the calculated density profiles of @xmath82ne in both linear and logarithmic scales .",
    "the nucleus @xmath82ne is strongly deformed with skm@xmath52 ( @xmath83 ) , while the shape is almost spherical with sly4 ( @xmath84 ) . in this case , two parameter sets exhibit quite different density profiles , especially in the outer region that is crucial to determine the matter radius .",
    "the density calculated with skm@xmath52 is larger than the one with sly4 at @xmath85 fm .    in order to see how the above density difference leads to the difference in the total reaction cross section ,",
    "we plot the difference of the reaction probabilities calculated with the skm@xmath52 and sly4 interactions @xmath86 note that @xmath87 depends only on @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "[ reacprobne.fig ] , we show @xmath89 multiplied by @xmath90 for @xmath82ne projectile on both @xmath2c and proton targets for comparison . though we see some difference in the interior density as shown in fig",
    ".  [ densne.fig ] , it has almost no contribution to @xmath89 for a @xmath2c target , while @xmath89 on a proton target shows oscillatory behavior reflecting the difference of the density profiles between 2@xmath914 fm .",
    "the reaction on a @xmath2c target is insensitive to the internal density profiles .",
    "in contrast , we can see the difference in the outer region ( fig .",
    "[ reacprobne.fig ] ) .",
    "the reaction on a @xmath2c target is advantageous to probe the density at large distances .",
    "let us next discuss mg isotopes .",
    "figures  [ betamg.fig ] and  [ radiimg.fig ] display the quadrupole deformation parameters and the matter , neutron , and proton rms radii for mg isotopes .",
    "the trend of the deformation parameters is very similar to that of ne isotopes . similarly",
    "to ne case , the @xmath60 values obtained with skm * are larger than that with sly4 for @xmath57 .",
    "this behavior influences the matter radii as well as the neutron and proton radii as shown in fig .",
    "[ radiimg.fig ] .",
    "we also plot the radii obtained by the fermionic molecular dynamics approach ( fmd )  @xcite .",
    "though the fmd radii tend to be slightly smaller than our hf radii in @xmath92 , the hf radii with skm * are very close to the fmd radii for @xmath62 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the trend of the quadrupole deformations is also similar to that obtained with skm*.    the deformation @xmath60 calculated with skm * is very similar to that of ne case . the difference can be observed only for @xmath93 : the ne isotopes have oblate shape with small deformation , while the mg isotopes have prolate shape .",
    "experimental excitation energies of the first @xmath94 states , @xmath72 , of @xmath95 mg ( @xmath61 , 18 ) are almost the same , whereas we see a rapid decrease of @xmath72 in @xmath96ne  @xcite .",
    "again , this is qualitatively consistent with the calculation .    in fig .",
    "[ reacmg.fig ] we show the total reaction cross sections calculated using the skm * and sly4 interactions for mg isotopes incident on a @xmath2c target .",
    "a comparison with experiment is very interesting to judge whether the neutron rich mg isotopes favor the strong deformation or not and also whether the hf densities at @xmath97 can reproduce experimental cross sections or not because they predict larger radii than the fmd calculation . here",
    "we comment on the cross section of @xmath98 mg .",
    "since the neutron separation energy of @xmath98 mg is considered to be small ( @xmath91162 kev )  @xcite , and the @xmath60 value of @xmath98 mg is fairly large , a situation similar to @xmath4ne may occur in @xmath98 mg as well .",
    "if that is the case , the cross section predicted for @xmath98 mg will be increased than the present value .",
    "we hope the measured values of the total reaction ( interaction ) cross sections are made available soon  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the cases of si and s isotopes , which will show deformation different from ne and mg isotopes .",
    "figures  [ betasis.fig ] and [ radiisis.fig ] plot the quadrupole deformation parameters as well as the point matter , neutron , and proton rms radii for si and s isotopes , respectively .",
    "we also see some kinks in the calculated matter , neutron , and proton radii in fig .",
    "[ radiisis.fig ] , corresponding to the peaks of the quadruple deformation parameter displayed in fig .",
    "[ betasis.fig ] .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath60 for si and s isotopes are significantly smaller than those of ne and mg isotopes , in the region of @xmath99 , which suggests that the island of inversion does not reach @xmath100 ( si ) .",
    "this is probably due to that 14 protons favor the oblate shape , while the neutrons tend to deform the system into a prolate shape for @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the competition between protons and neutrons determines the deformation .",
    "the enhancement of the matter radii for @xmath68 is not as strong as that in ne and mg isotopes , corresponding to the moderate change of @xmath60 values .",
    "the matter radii of si and s isotopes show similar enhancement .",
    "the proton radii of s isotopes , however , tend to be larger than those of si isotopes due to the occupation of the @xmath102 orbit .",
    "the neutron and matter radii of s isotopes also show kink behaviors at @xmath103 .",
    "this may be due to the decrease of the deformation at @xmath104 to 28 and the occupation of low-@xmath105 ( @xmath50 ) orbitals beyond @xmath103 .",
    "note that similar kink behaviors at @xmath103 are predicted in the low - energy @xmath106 strength for s isotopes but not for si isotopes  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ rcs.fig ] , we plot the predicted total reaction cross sections of si and s isotopes on a @xmath2c target at 240 @xmath1 mev . for the sake of comparison , the @xmath76 values for ne and mg isotopes are also drawn .",

    "we have shown that the present theory reproduces the total reaction or interaction cross section data at the medium energy of 240@xmath1mev .",

    "[ reacne.fig ] ) .",
    "it is also noted that , although the calculation produces a smooth neutron number dependence , the measured cross sections show an irregular decrease at @xmath115 mg .    since our calculations at 240@xmath1mev reproduce the recent measurement very well and",

    "the systematic measurements of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) for a long chain of isotopes may reveal the enhancement of the nuclear size which can be a signature of the nuclear deformation . we have found that the proton radii also follow the same behavior of the matter radii . if one can measure the proton radii , for example , by charge changing cross sections , they also give information on nuclear deformations as well as nuclear skin - thicknesses .",

    "resolution of these problems requires further investigations in both theory and experiment .",
    "it is interesting to examine the total reaction cross sections on a different target because they give different sensitivity to the density profile of the projectile nucleus .",
