    "<S> i.e. _ along and perpendicular to the paired dimer rows . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the zero bias conductance of these surface states under flat - band condition and find that conduction along the dimer row direction is significant due to strong orbital hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the surface conductance is orders of magnitude higher than the bulk conductance close to the band edges for the unpassivated surface at room temperature . </S>",

    "<S> the models consist of sixteen atomic layers shown in fig . 1 to eliminate quantization effects and hence to obtain bulk si band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of si atoms ( excluding h atoms on top and back surface ) per unit cell are also given . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , a ( 2@xmath01 ) unit cell has two repeating unit cells in the [ 110 ] direction ( perpendicular to dimer row ) and one unit cells in the @xmath3 $ ] direction ( along dimer row ) . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     models iv and v are the same as models ii and iii , but the transmission is calculated in @xmath4 $ ] direction . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the overall transmission is smaller even inside the conduction and the valence bands , because si atoms in the top four surface layers are further apart due to asymmetric reconstruction . apart from this , for model iv , </S>",
    "<S> since atoms corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 states are now 7.68 @xmath5 apart , there is small hybridization between atoms on which @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are localized and hence surface state hopping is quenched . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum transmission inside band gap for model iv is about @xmath6 , which gives a conductance of about @xmath7 . for model </S>",
    "<S> v , the unpassivated bottom and top dimer atoms in the transport direction are about 15.36 @xmath5 apart , which results in very small hybridization of the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the transmission through these states for model v is even smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> we show the calculated zero bias conductance under flat - band condition at room temperature on a linear and a logarithmic scale in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance for model ii and iii is orders of magnitude higher than the model i inside the band gap . for model iv , </S>",
    "<S> the conductance is about two orders of magnitude higher for the @xmath1 states and less than one order of magnitude higher for the @xmath2 states than those of model v. furthermore , the zero bias conductance decreases exponentially inside the band gap due to the fermi tail . for the experimental conditions used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the band bending is small and hence based on our flat - band zero bias conductance calculations , we propose that the surface state hoping is the dominant conduction mechanism in the recently reported stm of lightly doped silicon nanomembranes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since the transport is coherent and the channel is in the ballistic regime , the transmission is independent of the channel length . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the results reported provide an upper limit of transmission and conductance for these surface states . in this study , </S>",
    "<S> effects of gate voltage and realistic contacts are ignored . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we provide the basic formalism to perform these calculations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we leave the role of defects , the electrostatic effects of the dopant atoms and dephasing due to electron - phonon scattering for future work . interestingly </S>",
    "<S> , it has been suggested that atomic steps on si(111 ) surface can decrease conduction by two orders of magnitude @xcite . </S>"
