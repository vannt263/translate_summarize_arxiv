    "the enumeration of polyominoes is a topic of great interest to chemists , physicists and combinatorialists alike . in chemical terms",
    ", any polyomino ( with hexagonal cells ) is a possible benzenoid hydrocarbon . in physics ,",
    "determining the number of @xmath2-celled polyominoes is related to the study of two - dimensional percolation phenomena . in combinatorics , polyominoes are of interest in their own right because several polyomino models have good - looking exact solutions .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of @xmath2-celled polyominoes .",
    "an exact formula for @xmath3 seems unlikely to ever be found .",
    "however , there exist notable results on the quantity @xmath4{a_n}$ ] .",
    "( this quantity is called the _ growth constant_. ) in the case of polyominoes with hexagonal cells , vge and guttmann @xcite gave a rigorous proof that the growth constant @xmath5 exists and satisfies the inequality @xmath6 .",
    "in the same paper , it is estimated that @xmath7 .    in this paper , we are not going to improve the above - stated bounds on @xmath5 .",
    "instead , we are going to revisit _ column - convex polyominoes_. the first to study this now - familiar model was temperley @xcite in 1956 . whether with square cells or with hexagonal cells , column - convex polyominoes have a rational area generating function .",
    "when cells are hexagons , the growth constant of column - convex polyominoes is @xmath8 ( klarner @xcite ) .",
    "this growth constant remained a record ( among polyomino models having _ reasonably simple _ exact solutions ) until 1982 , when dhar , phani and barma @xcite invented _ directed site animals_. directed site animals with step - set @xmath9 can be viewed as a family of polyominoes with square cells , while directed site animals with step - set @xmath10 can be viewed as a family of polyominoes with hexagonal cells .",
    "if the step - set is @xmath11 , the growth constant of directed site animals is exactly @xmath12 .",
    "incidentally , with either of the step - sets @xmath13 and @xmath11 , the area generating function of directed site animals is algebraic ( which is rather surprising ) and satisfies a simple quadratic equation .",
    "later on , in 2002 , bousquet - mlou and rechnitzer @xcite introduced _ stacked directed animals _ and _ multi - directed animals_. those two models substantially generalize directed site animals .",
    "whether the cells are squares or hexagons , the area generating function of stacked directed animals is degree - two algebraic , and the area generating function of multi - directed animals is not d - finite . when cells are hexagons , the growth constant of stacked directed animals is exactly @xmath14 , and the growth constant of multi - directed animals is @xmath15 .",
    "although descended from directed animals , multi - directed animals are also a superset of column - convex polyominoes .",
    "( to be precise , this holds when the cells are hexagons .",
    "it is not quite clear whether multi - directed animals with square cells are a superset of column - convex polyominoes with square cells . ) besides multi - directed animals , there exist two other generalizations of column - convex polyominoes .",
    "those two generalizations are called @xmath16__-convex polygons _ _ @xcite and _ prudent polygons _",
    "so far , however , @xmath16-convex polygons and prudent polygons have not been enumerated by area ; they have only been enumerated by perimeter .",
    "the aim of this paper is to define a model which ( a ) generalizes column - convex polyominoes , ( b ) possesses a reasonably simple area generating function , and ( c ) possesses a high growth constant . in view of the facts stated above",
    ", we shall have to compete with just one pre - existing model , namely with multi - directed animals .    in this paper",
    ", we actually introduce a sequence of generalizations of _ hexagonal - celled _ column - convex polyominoes .",
    "namely , we define _ level _ @xmath16 _ cheesy polyominoes _ ( @xmath17 ) . at every level",
    ", our new model has a rational area generating function .",
    "however , as level increases , those rational generating functions quickly gain in size . in computing generating functions ,",
    "we go up to level @xmath18 .",
    "the computations are done by using bousquet - mlou s @xcite and svrtan s  @xcite  turbo \" version of the temperley method @xcite .",
    "the growth constants of level @xmath19 , level @xmath20 and level @xmath18 cheesy polyominoes turn out to be @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "thus , the growth constants of cheesy polyominoes are not as high as @xmath24 , the growth constant of multi - directed animals .",
    "however , we expect to obtain greater growth constants ( @xmath14 or more ) in our next two papers .",
    "namely , we have in view two generalizations of level @xmath16 cheesy polyominoes",
    ". the names of those two generalizations are _ level _ @xmath16 _ polyominoes with cheesy blocks _ and _ level _ @xmath16 _ column - subconvex polyominoes_. incidentally , for every @xmath25 , the area generating function of level @xmath16 polyominoes with cheesy blocks is rational , whereas the area generating function of level @xmath16 column - subconvex polyominoes is probably not d - finite .",
    "we are also planning to study similar generalizations of square - celled column - convex polyominoes .",
    "let us mention , however , that our new hexagonal - celled models behave somewhat better than their square - celled counterparts .",
    "solving a square - celled level @xmath19 model requires almost as much effort as solving a hexagonal - celled level @xmath20 model .",
    "there are three regular tilings of the euclidean plane , namely the triangular tiling , the square tiling , and the hexagonal tiling .",
    "we adopt the convention that every square or hexagonal tile has two horizontal edges . in a regular tiling , a tile is often referred to as a _",
    "cell_. a plane figure @xmath26 is a _ polyomino _ if @xmath26 is a union of finitely many cells and the interior of @xmath26 is connected .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "observe that , if a union of _ hexagonal _ cells is connected , then it possesses a connected interior as well .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be two polyominoes .",
    "we consider @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be equal if and only if there exists a translation @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .    from now on , we concentrate on the hexagonal tiling .",
    "when we write  a polyomino \" , we actually mean  a hexagonal - celled polyomino \" .",
    "given a polyomino @xmath26 , it is useful to partition the cells of @xmath26 according to their horizontal projection .",
    "each block of that partition is a _ column _ of @xmath26 .",
    "note that a column of a polyomino is not necessarily a connected set .",
    "an example of this is the highlighted column in figure  1 . on the other hand",
    ", it may happen that every column of a polyomino @xmath26 is a connected set . in this case",
    ", the polyomino @xmath26 is a _ column - convex polyomino_. see figure 2 .",

    "for example , in figure 1 , the upper component of the highlighted column has no edge in common with the previous column .",
    "suppose that @xmath26 is such a polyomino that the first ( _ i.e. _ , leftmost ) column of @xmath26 has no gap and that , in every pair of adjacent columns of @xmath26 , every connected component of the right column has at least one edge in common with the left column .",
    "then we say that @xmath26 is a _ rightward - semi - directed polyomino_.    a polyomino @xmath26 is a",
    "@xmath16 _ cheesy polyomino _ if the following holds :    * @xmath26 is a rightward - semi - directed polyomino , * every column of @xmath26 has at most two connected components , * if a column of @xmath26 has two connected components , then the gap between the components consists of at most @xmath16 cells .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "level one cheesy polyominoes are a subset of level two cheesy polyominoes , level two cheesy polyominoes are a subset of level three cheesy polyominoes , and so on . as @xmath16 tends to infinity , the set of level @xmath16 cheesy polyominoes tends ( in a certain sense ) to the set of all polyominoes which are rightward - semi - directed and are made up of columns with at most two connected components .",
    "the name  cheesy polyominoes \" is intended to suggest that these polyominoes can have internal holes . at this point",
    ", it might be objected that there exists another model , called _ directed animals _ , in which holes occur more freely than in cheesy polyominoes .",
    "a column of a directed animal can have any number of holes , and the sizes of those holes are not subject to any limitations . however , the name of our model has 11 years of tradition .",
    "so , our model will retain the name  cheesy polyominoes \" despite the fact that directed animals are arguably  cheesier \" .",
