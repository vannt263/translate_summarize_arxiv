    "a massive black hole in a galactic nucleus grows by accreting matter from its surroundings , some of it in the form of stars that approach it on low angular momentum orbits ( loss - cone orbits ) . when the bh mass @xmath0 is sufficiently small so that its tidal radius @xmath1 is larger than its schwarzschild radius @xmath2 ( @xmath3 for the disruption of solar type stars ) , the star is tidally disrupted before crossing the event horizon .",
    "the accretion of stellar debris from such events may give rise to observable `` tidal flares '' ( frank & rees @xcite ) .",
    "various authors estimated the rates , timescales , luminosities and spectra of the flares ( ulmer , paczyski & goodman @xcite ; ulmer @xcite ; syer & ulmer @xcite ; magorrian & tremaine @xcite ; ayal , livio & piran @xcite ) .",
    "there is to date only marginal evidence for the detection of tidal flares ( e.g. renzini et al .",
    "@xcite ; komossa & bade @xcite ; komossa & greiner @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we propose another tidal process whereby the bh may reveal its presence .",
    "we consider the fate of stars that narrowly escape tidal disruption by the central bh after being subjected to extreme tidal distortion , spin - up , mixing and mass - loss during periastron passage .",
    "the total mass in such stars is comparable to that in stars that are disrupted , and therefore also to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass fraction of the bh that originates in tidally disrupted stars , and @xmath6 is the fraction of a disrupted star s mass that is ultimately accreted ( @xmath7 , e.g. ayal et al .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 is significant for a low mass bh ( @xmath9 ) that accretes from a low - density galactic nuclear core , where mass loss from stellar collisions is small .",
    "murphy , cohn & durisen ( @xcite ) found @xmath10 in fokker - planck simulations of the growth of a low mass bh in a galactic nucleus ( their model 4b ) , assuming polytropic stellar models for estimating the collisional mass loss .",
    "more recently , freitag & benz ( 2001 , in preparation ) found @xmath11 for the same galactic nucleus model using monte - carlo simulations with more realistic stellar models , which are more centrally concentrated than polytropes , and therefore lose less mass in collisions .",
    "they also find @xmath8 as high as @xmath12 for low - density nuclei where the stellar mass function is weighted toward low - mass stars .",
    "dynamical analyses of the scattering of stars into loss - cone orbits ( lightman & shapiro @xcite ; see magorrian & tremaine @xcite for numeric examples ) show that tidally disrupted stars in galactic nuclei are typically on slightly unbound orbits relative to the bh and that they are predominantly scattered into the loss - cone from orbits at the radius of influence of the bh , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the velocity dispersion far from the bh .",
    "the stellar mass that is enclosed within @xmath15 is comparable to @xmath0 .",
    "the scattering timescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale , and so the stars are scattered in and out of the loss - cone several times during one orbital period .",
    "following the first close passage near the bh the stars are on very eccentric orbits with apoastron @xmath16 , and so there is a considerable chance that they will be scattered again out of the loss - cone before their next close passage , and thus avoid eventual orbital decay and disruption .",
    "the survival probability is further increased by the brownian motion of the bh relative to the dynamical center of the stellar system . in a system composed of stars with a typical mass @xmath17 and radius @xmath18 and a low mass bh , which evolve in an initially constant density core of radius @xmath19 ,",
    "the amplitude of the brownian fluctuations is much larger than the tidal radius , @xmath20 ( bahcall & wolf @xcite ) .",
    "the brownian motion proceeds on the dynamical timescale of the core , which is comparable to the orbital period of the tidally disturbed stars .",
    "while these results strictly apply only if the bh is embedded in an isothermal system , which is not the case in the gc , they are expected to hold generally to within an order of magnitude .",
    "the orbits of the tidally scattered stars take them outside of @xmath15 , where they are no longer affected by the relative shift between the bh and the stellar mass . therefore , on re - entry into the volume of influence , their orbit will not bring them to the same peri - distance from the bh .",
    "both the random motion of the bh and the scattering off the loss - cone by two - body interactions are expected to increase the survival fraction @xmath21 to a significantly high value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ) .",
    "more detailed calculations , which integrate over the orbital distribution , are required to confirm these qualitative arguments .",
    "the cross section for a close passage with a peri - distance @xmath22 scales as @xmath23 for stars on nearly parabolic orbits ( hills @xcite ; frank @xcite ) .",
    "it then follows that the number of stars on nearly loss - cone orbits ( @xmath24 ) is comparable to the number of disrupted stars , and so the mass fraction associated with stars in the volume of influence that have undergone extreme tidal disturbance , @xmath25 , is significant .",
    "the tidal interaction between the star and the bh is described in the reduced mass system where the star , of mass @xmath17 and radius @xmath18 , is stationary and the bh approaches it on an unbound orbit with a peridistance @xmath23 .",
    "the tilde symbol is used to denote quantities expressed in the units where @xmath26 . in these units @xmath27 is the centrifugal break - up angular frequency and @xmath28 is the star s binding energy up to a factor of order unity .",
    "high rotation is the longest lasting dynamical effect of a hyperbolic tidal interaction that does not end in capture , and so we will use the spin - up of the star by the tidal encounter , @xmath29 , as a measure of the long - term effects on the star .",
    "a general treatment of spin - up by hyperbolic encounters can be found in alexander & kumar ( @xcite ) , where it is applied to star - star tidal interactions .",
    "here we apply the formalism to the star - bh interaction .",
    "the tidal disruption radius for slightly hyperbolic orbits is @xmath30 in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the tidal interaction in terms of the the penetration factor @xmath32 .",
    "the linear tidal coupling coefficients @xmath33 are functions of the parameter @xmath34 , where @xmath35 in the limit @xmath31 , and of the eccentricity of the orbit @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the orbital energy of the 2-body reduced mass system .",
    "the spin - up due to the transfer of angular momentum from the orbit by the tidal interaction is related to the energy transfer by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the relative angular velocity at periastron , @xmath40 is the star s moment of inertia , and rigid body rotation is assumed ( goldreich & nicholson @xcite ; kumar & quataert @xcite ) . on parabolic orbits",
    "@xmath41@xmath42 is independent of @xmath0 to leading order in the multipole expansion , and can be expressed as ( e.g. press & teukolsky @xcite ) @xmath43 the linear analysis of the spin - up breaks down as @xmath44 decreases and @xmath29 approaches 1 . at first @xmath29 increases faster than predicted by the linear analysis , but then it peaks at the onset of mass - loss as the ejecta carry away the angular momentum . in the results presented here we do not correct for the non - linear effects , and so formally very high values of @xmath29 should be understood as indicating any combination of mass - loss , mixing or spin - up effects .",
    "the tidal coupling coefficients can be calculated numerically for any given stellar model . in our analysis",
    "we will use two stellar models : a @xmath45 ideal gas polytrope , and a solar model ( christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrate the tidal scattering effect by considering the fate of a star on a circular orbit at an initial radius @xmath46 that loses angular momentum , but not energy , in a 2-body interaction and is deflected into a near loss - cone orbit with peri - distance @xmath47 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the stellar mass within @xmath48 equals the bh mass , that it is negligible within @xmath23 , and that its distribution is proportional to @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "it then follows from energy conservation on orbits in a spherical mass distribution that the orbital energy of the reduced mass system at @xmath44 ( i.e. excluding the potential of the stellar cluster ) is @xmath51 and the eccentricity is @xmath52",
    "we apply our model to the @xmath53 bh in the galactic center ( gc ) , which is of particular interest because present - day observations can already resolve individual stars very close to the bh ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ; ghez et al .",
    "the bh in the gc is surrounded by a 2-body relaxed cusp with @xmath54 and has a radius of influence of @xmath55 ( alexander @xcite ) . for the bh in the gc , @xmath56 for a solar type star , and",
    "so general relativistic corrections can be safely neglected ( laguna et al .",
    "@xcite ) . figure [ fig : dw ] shows the cumulative values of the ratio between the rate of near loss - cone encounters ( @xmath57 and the total rate of disruptive encounters , the orbital period after the first periastron passage , and the apoastron distance after the first periastron passage , all as functions of @xmath29 .",
    "the orbits have @xmath58 , but are still effectively parabolic , with @xmath59 . for the solar stellar model ,",
    "the orbital energy remains positive after the first periastron passage for all values of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , which corresponds to unbound _ and _ tidally disturbed stars ( defined here as having @xmath62 ) of total mass @xmath63 .",
    "for the polytropic stellar model , which is less centrally concentrated and therefore more easily perturbed by the tidal interaction , the orbital energy remains positive after the first periastron passage for all values of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , which corresponds to unbound tidally disturbed stars of total mass @xmath66 .",
    "the plots of the orbital period and apoastron radius confirm that the qualitative arguments presented in  [ s : intro ] hold for all but the closest periastron passages .",
    "we have argued that a significant fraction of the stars around a supermassive black hole in a galactic center experience considerable spin - up , due to extreme tidal interactions with the central bh . unlike the star  star tidal interactions considered by alexander & kumar ( @xcite ) , which also lead to high rotation , this mechanism does not require an extremely high stellar density .",
    "we further note that the tidally disturbed stars will remain in the galactic center even after tidal scattering ceases in the later phase of the bh growth when its mass exceeds @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "assuming @xmath69 , @xmath11 and solar type stars , and considering only orbits that are unbound to the bh after the first periastron passage , we estimate that the galactic center contains @xmath70 stars that have survived an extreme tidal interaction with the central bh .",
    "we now examine briefly potential observational signatures of such interactions .",
    "the effects of rotation on stellar evolution have been studied extensively by a number of authors ( see e.g. maeder & meynet @xcite ; heger & langer @xcite , and references therein ) . here",
    "we want to concentrate in particular on a few observable effects : ( 1 ) the luminosity , ( 2 ) abundance anomalies , and ( 3 ) colors .",
    "rotationally induced mixing results in higher bolometric luminosities for a given mass , due to the increase in the mean molecular weight @xmath71 , and in the convective core size .",
    "mixing also brings the products of hydrogen burning to the stellar surface .",
    "thus , one can expect enrichment in @xmath72he , @xmath73n , @xmath74c , and @xmath75al , and depletion in @xmath76c , @xmath77o , @xmath78n .",
    "combining these two effects , one of the consequences of high rotation rates is stronger abundance anomalies in more luminous stars .",
    "interestingly , these were precisely the effects observed by carr , sellgren & balachandran ( @xcite ) , in their abundance measurements of the m supergiant irs 7 in the galactic center .",
    "the low c and o and high n abundances indicate that irs 7 has undergone mixing in excess of the values predicted by standard models ( or observed in other supergiants like @xmath79ori ) .",
    "in fact , the observed abundances have prompted carr et al . to conclude that `` extra mixing induced by rapid rotation may indeed be the fundamental difference between the evolution of massive stars in the galactic center and those elsewhere in the galaxy . ''",
    "the third effect is relevant particularly to stars that would have otherwise ( with no tidal spin - up ) been red supergiants or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "the envelopes of such stars ( particularly the latter ) are relatively loosely bound to their cores .",
    "consequently , even modest amounts of tidal interaction and spin - up lead to a loss of all or a part of the envelope ( e.g. livio @xcite ) .",
    "the stripped , more compact star will thus become blue .",
    "in fact , this mechanism has been proposed to explain the existence of a strange group of very blue stars in the globular cluster m15 ( de marchi & paresce @xcite ) , and the colors of sk  @xmath80 , the progenitor of sn1987a ( e.g. woosley @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations therefore predict that the stellar population in galactic centers will exhibit a paucity in red giants , and will rather be relatively rich in blue stars .",
    "concentrations of blue stars around the central bh are found in both the galactic center ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) and in m31 ( lauer et al .",
    "many of the blue stars are predicted to be on elongated ( `` radial '' ) orbits .",
    "observations of the sgr a@xmath81 stellar cluster in the galactic center appear to be consistent with this prediction ( genzel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although the orbital solutions are still quite uncertain ( ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
