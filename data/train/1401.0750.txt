    "blackouts are complicated sequences of dependent outages which could bring about tremendous economic and social losses [ [ nerc]][[tf ] ] .",
    "large rare cascading blackouts have substantial risk and pose great challenges in simulation , analysis , and mitigation .",
    "it is important to study the mechanisms of cascading failures so that the risk of large - scale blackouts may be better quantified and mitigated .    in order to study cascading failures ,",
    "several models have been proposed , such as cascade model [ [ cascade ] ] , branching process model [ [ bp10]][[bp12 ] ] , hidden failure model [ [ phadke ] ] , [ [ chen ] ] , opa model [ [ opa1]][[opa4 ] ] , improved opa model [ [ improved ] ] , ac opa model [ [ ac opa ] ] , [ [ ac opa1 ] ] , opa with slow process [ [ slow ] ] , manchester model [ [ rios ] ] , [ [ kirschen ] ] , stochastic model [ [ anghel ] ] , dynamic pra model [ [ pra ] ] , and influence model @xcite .",
    "the opa model [ [ opa1]][[opa4 ] ] simulates the patterns of cascading blackouts of a power system under the complex dynamics of a growing demand and the engineering responses to failure .",
    "initial line outages are generated randomly by assuming that each line can fail independently .",
    "whenever a line fails , the generation and load is redispatched with dc load flow model and linear programming .",
    "if any lines were overloaded during the optimization , then these lines are those that are likely to have experienced high stress , and each of these lines fails independently .",
    "the process of redispatch and testing for line outages is iterated until there are no more outages .",
    "the branching process model [ [ bp10]][[bp12 ] ] can statistically describe the statistical or simulated cascades and provide higher - level statistical information about cascading failures by tracking the numbers of lines outaged and the amounts of load shed .",
    "but it does not retain information about the network topology or load flow and also does not attempt to specify how cascades propagate in the system in detail , such as which , where , or why lines outage .",
    "the most recent study on the line interaction graph @xcite initiates a novel analysis method for cascading failures by considering the interactions of transmission lines and tries to understand cascading failures with models amenable to analysis while keeping the basic physics of power systems .    from the perspective of complex systems",
    "the system - level failures are not caused by any specific event but by the property that the components in the system are tightly coupled and interdependent @xcite .",
    "thus explicitly studying the interactions between components can help understand the mechanisms of cascading failures , identify the key factors for their propagation , and further propose effective mitigation measures .    in this paper",
    "we quantify the interactions between component failures by following the line graph approach in @xcite .",
    "these interactions can capture the general patterns of the propagation of cascading failures in a system and help better understand why and how cascading failures occur and propagate .",
    "key links between component failures which play important roles in the propagation of cascading failures can also be identified and further be used for determining wide area protection schemes [ [ begovic]][[sun2 ] ] , such as relay blocking under the condition of some specific line tripping , which can secure time to perform remedial controls by a defense system during cascaded events [ [ ccliu ] ] .",
    "a cascading failure model called interaction model is further proposed based on these interactions to speed up simulation and to study how component interactions influence cascading failure risks .",
    "it is much more time efficient to first quantify the interactions between the component failures with fewer original cascades from more detailed cascading failure model , such as ac opa [ [ ac opa ] ] , [ [ ac opa1 ] ] , and then perform the interaction model simulation than it is to directly simulate a large number of cascades with a more detailed model .    besides",
    ", topological properties such as small - world [ [ small world ] ] and scale - free [ [ scale free ] ] behaviors have been found in complex networks .",
    "but it can be misleading to evaluate the vulnerability of power systems only with topological metrics [ [ topology ] ] . in this paper",
    "we discuss the property of a directed weighted interaction network generated with simulated cascades from a more detailed cascading failure model which considers the physics of the system such as power flow and re - dispatching rather than directly exploring the property of the network from the topology of the physical system .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ interaction ] explains how the interactions between component failures can be quantified .",
    "section [ keylink ] discusses the identification of the key links and key components based on the obtained interactions .",
    "section [ model ] proposes an interaction model by using the quantified interactions and also discusses methods for validating it .",
    "section [ num needed ] proposes methods to determine how many cascades should be simulated and how many cascades should be utilized to quantify the interaction between component failures .",
    "section [ miti ] discusses the mitigation measures by weakening key links and the potential application in real systems as a wide area protection scheme .",
    "section [ simulation ] tests the proposed interaction quantifying method and the interaction model with line outage data generated by ac opa simulations on ieee 118-bus system .",
    "finally the conclusion is drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section the cascades that record cascading failure sequences are used to quantify the interactions between component failures .    for power systems the transmission lines or transformers can be chosen as components and the cascades can come from either statistical utility line outage data or simulations from more detailed cascading failure models .",
    "the statistical data can be grouped into different cascades and then into different generations within each cascade based on outages timing [ [ bp12 ] ] .",
    "the simulation data can be generated from opa model or its variants [ [ opa1]][[slow ] ] , which naturally produce line outages in generations or stages ; each iteration of the  main loop \" of the simulation produces another generation [ [ bp10 ] ] , [ [ bp13 ] ] .",
    "ac opa model [ [ ac opa ] ] , [ [ ac opa1 ] ] will be employed in the case studies of this paper to produce cascades for qualifying component interactions .",
    "but the data can also be generated from other cascading simulation tools as long as they can be grouped into cascades and generations .",
    "the cascades used for quantifying the interactions between component failures are called original cascades in order to distinguish the simulated cascades from the proposed model in this paper . @xmath0",
    "original cascades can be arranged as    [ data ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     when many times of simulation need to be performed the advantage of first quantifying the interactions and then doing the interaction model simulation will become more obvious .",
    "assume it takes @xmath1 and @xmath2 to generate one cascade from ac opa model and the interaction model and we have @xmath3 .",
    "as in table [ index2 ] , the time for calculating the probability that each component fails in generation 0 and the interaction matrix by using @xmath4 cascades is denoted by @xmath5 . to get @xmath6 sets of @xmath0 cascades , the ratio between the simulation time for ac opa model and that for first quantifying the interactions and then performing interaction model simulation is @xmath7 and by letting @xmath8 we can get @xmath9 which indicate a significant efficiency improvement for the interaction model simulations compared with the ac opa simulations .    in our case @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath12 . by letting @xmath13 ,",
    "we show how @xmath14 changes with @xmath6 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ efficiencyplot ] , in which we can see that @xmath14 first quickly increases and then finally saturates at about 7200 . also as expected , when @xmath6 is not large enough the efficiency improvement for @xmath17 is better than that for @xmath16 because smaller @xmath4 will lead to shorter time for obtaining original cascades from ac opa simulation and also shorter time for quantifying the interactions .     for different @xmath6 .",
    "circles , squares , and triangles indicate the efficiency improvement @xmath14 for using 41000 , 8000 , and 3680 original cascades .",
    "the dash horizontal line indicates @xmath18 .",
    ", width=268 ]    the efficiency improvement can be reflected in studying the effects of mitigation measures .",
    "the interaction model can generate cascades and study the influence of component interactions on cascading failure risk much more time efficiently while reserving most of the general properties of the cascades .",
    "in section [ mitigationresult ] we have shown that the simulated cascades from interaction model are consistent with the ac opa simulation under the same mitigation strategy . however , in order to obtain the cascades under a specific mitigation strategy ac opa simulation will need about 57 hours to obtain 41000 cascades while the interaction model simulation only requires about 29 seconds to obtain the same number of cascades by simply changing some elements in the already obtained interaction matrix .",
    "this efficiency improvement is important if we would like to quickly find out the impact of a mitigation measure .",
    "further , as mentioned in section [ model ] , the proposed interaction model can be used for online decision - making support by fast predicting the consequences of the events happening in the system . for online operation",
    "there is no enough time for performing detailed cascading failure simulations .",
    "but we can obtain the interaction matrix offline from simulations of detailed cascading failure models or from statistical utility data and then apply the interaction model to quickly find out the components or areas of the system that will most probably be affected so that a fast response can be performed to pull the system back to normal conditions and to avoid or at least reduce the economic and social losses .",
    "the efficiency improvement of the interaction model reflected in this aspect is a great advantage compared with many other cascading failure models .",
    "in this paper we quantify the interaction between component failures by calculating the probability that one component failure causes another and obtain the interaction matrix and interaction network .",
    "key links and key components are identified and an interaction model is proposed to simulate cascading failures and study how interactions between component failures influence cascading failure risk .",
    "the interaction quantifying method and interaction model are validated to be able to capture general properties of the original cascades .",
    "it is much more time efficient to first quantify the interactions between the component failures with fewer original cascades from more detailed cascading failure model , such as ac opa , and then perform the interaction model simulation than it is to directly simulate a large number of cascades with a more detailed model .",
    "the obtained interaction network can reveal the non - local property of the propagation of cascading failures , which has been seen in several blackouts in real power systems .",
    "an obvious power law is found in the distributions of the link weights and the vertex out - strength and in - strength of the interaction network , suggesting that a small number of links and components are much more crucial than the others .",
    "cascading failure risks can be greatly mitigated by weakening a few key links , which can be implemented in real systems by wide area protection that blocks the operation of relays of the lines corresponding to the destination vertices of key links when the lines corresponding to the source vertices are tripped .",
    "further , the proposed interaction model can also be used for online decision - making support by predicting the consequences of the events based on the interaction matrix obtained offline from simulations of more detailed cascading failure model or from statistical utility data .",
