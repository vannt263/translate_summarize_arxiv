    "because of its great importance for nanotechnological applications , control of friction at the nanoscale is a hot topic of current research .",
    "while conventional lubricants can not be applied for this purpose , research efforts have been guided by the vision of richard feynman that the nanobearings can `` run dry '' @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that decreasing the normal load @xcite or pulling velocity @xcite , as well as normal load actuation @xcite can lead to a dramatic friction reduction .",
    "a mechanism of friction control particularly pertinent to our present work is the so - called structural lubricity , or superlubricity @xcite , arising due to the structural incommensurability of the two contacting surfaces .",
    "more precisely , each atom of the sliding surface feels the force generated by the periodically arranged atoms of the substrate , so that the total friction force is the sum of the forces felt by each atom of the slider .",
    "if the slider and the substrate are incommensurate , these forces add up randomly , resulting in nearly frictionless sliding .",
    "the phenomenon of superlubricity has been observed experimentally @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been demonstrated by means of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , as well as stochastic modelling and experiment @xcite that a flat nanoobject ( e.g. a graphite flake ) in contact with the surface quickly reorients itself into the `` commensurate '' state of high friction , even though the initial orientation may be the superlubric one .",
    "finally , one can influence the friction forces by using the rolling motion of round nanoparticles in between the surfaces @xcite .",
    "nanoparticle rolling can be identified experimentally by making a small indentation on its surface with a sharp tip of an atomic force microscope and subsequent localization of this mark after the manipulation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for a highly symmetric nanoparticle , such as a carbon nanotube , a rolling regime can be identified from the characteristic periodicity of the time - dependent friction force  in the rolling state , this periodicity is proportional to the circumference of the nanoparticle @xcite .     and attached to a spring of stiffness @xmath0 , whose other end is pulled with the velocity @xmath1 . the friction force @xmath2 is deduced from the elastic deformation of the spring attached to the upper plane , cf .",
    "( [ 300 ] ) . ]    in this paper , we consider the motion of a cylindrical nanoparticle sandwiched between two planes , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . because of the unavoidable deviations from a perfect rotational symmetry , the surface of the nanoparticle actually consists of facets characterized by different lattice constants , and hence by different commensurabilities with both planes @xcite .",
    "based on a simple model described in section  [ secii ] , we show in section  [ seciii ] that the nanoparticle can be stabilized in several friction states , namely , rolling friction and different sliding regimes that can be realized depending on which facets of the nanoparticle are in contact with the upper and lower surface .",
    "these results are summarized in a state diagram showing the stability regions of different friction states depending on the two experimental control parameters  normal load and pulling velocity .",
    "the state diagram contains a region , where sliding friction regimes characterized by commensurate contact ( high friction forces ) and incommensurate contact ( low friction forces ) of the nanoparticle coexist .",
    "we propose a friction switching scenario , allowing one to realize either low or high friction forces at the same pulling velocity and normal load .",
    "we consider a crystalline nanoparticle , approximating as close as possible a round shape of some preset radius , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . unlike the symmetric fullerene - like molecules with equivalent ` facets ' studied in refs .",
    ", in our system , the facets have different number of atoms and different commensurability with the planes , see fig .  [ fig1 ] , so that , depending on which facets are in contact with the planes , different friction regimes may be realized . while our model system from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is two - dimensional , the main results immediately carry over to some three - dimensional objects , such as nanorods .",
    "we henceforth consider a single particle , expecting analogous findings for the case of many particles , provided they are sufficiently dilute .",
    "the overall geometric configuration of the system is completely determined by the nanoparticle s center of mass @xmath3 , its rotation angle @xmath4 , and the position @xmath5 of some reference atom from the top plane , which we assume to be horizontal at all times ; here @xmath6 are the unit vectors in the @xmath7- and @xmath8-direction . if the nanoparticle and the planes could be viewed as rigid bodies , the equations of motion for the generalized coordinates @xmath9 would be derivable from the lagrangian @xmath10 where the first two terms represent the translational and rotational kinetic energy of the nanoparticle with mass @xmath11 and moment of inertia @xmath12 ; the third term describes the kinetic energy of the upper plane of mass @xmath13 ; the fourth and the fifth terms correspond to the interaction between the nanoparticle and the bottom and top planes , respectively ; the last two terms correspond to the energy of elastic deformation of the spring of stiffness @xmath0 whose other end is pulled at the constant velocity @xmath1 , and the energy of the upper plane produced by the normal load .",
    "therefore , the elastic force generated by the spring is equal in magnitude to the instantaneous friction force @xmath14 we furthermore assume that the separation between the two planes  the nanoparticle s diameter  is sufficiently large , so that the interaction energy between them is negligible .    in reality , the atoms of the nanoparticle and the planes are not rigidly coupled to each other , and their motion affects the motion of the global coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath4 , and @xmath16 .",
    "if the time scales of the overall nanoparticle motion is much slower than the time scale of individual atoms , the interaction between the global degrees of freedom , @xmath17 , and those of atoms composing the nanoparticle , both planes , and the spring can be approximately taken into account by means of the following three modifications of the equations of motion generated by the lagrangian ( [ 10 ] ) @xcite :    \\(i ) renormalization of the forces and torques acting on the relevant coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath4 , and @xmath16 ;    \\(ii ) introduction of velocity - dependent dissipation forces describing the effect of energy loss from the global degrees of freedom @xmath18 , and @xmath16 into the atomistic degrees of freedom of the nanoparticle , both planes , and the spring attached to the upper plane ;    \\(iii ) introduction of noise corresponding to the inverse process of energy transfer from random atomic vibrations into the global degrees of freedom .    the effect ( i )",
    "is accounted for by reinterpreting the energies @xmath19 as free energies .",
    "the dissipative forces ( ii ) due to the internal degrees of freedom of the nanoparticle and the planes can be derived from the dissipation function @xcite , @xmath20 where the generalized coordinate indices @xmath21 run over the values @xmath22 , and the dissipation coefficients are symmetric , @xmath23 these forces are written as velocity derivatives of the dissipation function , @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , an additional dissipative force on the upper plane arises due to the internal degrees of freedom of the spring : @xmath25 .",
    "this additional dissipation channel is not present in the dissipation function ( [ 20 ] ) , because the position @xmath26 of the pulled end of the spring is not a generalized coordinate in the lagrangian ( [ 10 ] ) ; therefore , the dissipative force @xmath27 should be included `` by hand '' .",

    "[ fig4](b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "high normal load stabilizes the sliding state of motion , which can be either the low - friction sliding ( lfs ) or the high - friction sliding ( hfs ) state . in both these states , the orientation angle @xmath4 of the nanoparticle performs small rocking motion around the value , which is either @xmath132 ( lfs state ) or @xmath133 ( hfs state ) , up to an integer multiple of @xmath122 .",
    "the lfs state corresponds to the incommensurate contact between the nanoparticle and the planes , while the high - friction sliding ( hfs ) state corresponds to the commensurate contact .",
    "the lfs state is stable above the solid line in fig .",

    "both lfs and hfs states are stable , and the actual state of motion of the nanoparticle depends on its initial preparation .",
    "interestingly , to the left of the intersection point at ca .",
    "@xmath134 , there is a region at lower normal loads where the lfs state is the only stable state of motion ; similarly , to the right of this point , there is a region at higher normal loads where the particle can exist only in the hfs state .",
    "we now try to understand the state diagram from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in order to destroy the contact",
    ", work must be performed against the adhesion forces and the normal load .",
    "this wok is done by the viscous drag , which scales linearly with the velocity @xmath1 , and by the force generated by the moving corrugated potential . at low pulling velocities , it is the latter force that is responsible for breaking the contact .",
    "if the nanoparticle is in the lfs - state , the effective corrugation of the potential is lower than that in the hfs - state , because the contact is incommensurate and involves fewer atoms .",
    "consequently , a smaller normal load is required to stabilize the lfs state , explaining its stability island in the low - velocity region .    at faster pulling , on the other hand , the effect of the potential corrugation becomes less important .",
    "this is so because the upper plane moves relatively fast with respect to the particle , so that the particle can not follow the fast temporal variations of its potential and feels , instead of the true corrugation depth @xmath135 , a smaller time - averaged corrugation .",
    "therefore , it is the viscous drag that is responsible for turning the nanoparticle at fast pulling . in order to break the contact , one has to overcome the adhesion between the nanoparticle and both planes .",

    "all curves are obtained for the same pulling velocity @xmath136 , but different normal loads : @xmath137 for the curves ( a ) and ( b ) , and @xmath138 for the curve ( c ) .",
    "the difference between the lfs- and hfs - curves ( a ) and ( b ) is in the orientation angle of the nanoparticle : namely , for the curve ( a ) , the angle @xmath4 is close to @xmath132 , and for the curve ( b ) , it is close to zero . ]",
    "[ fig3 ] exemplifies the typical evolution of the friction force ( [ 300 ] ) in the three states .",
    "the curves ( a ) and ( b ) resemble the typical evolution of the friction force in an atomic friction experiment in the stick - slip regime @xcite . during the stick phases , the nanoparticle and the upper plane are almost stationary , while the elastic deformation of the spring attached to the top plane constantly increases due to pulling .",
    "when elastic energy becomes sufficient to initiate the slip , the nanoparticle gets displaced in the @xmath7-direction by one lattice constant , and the upper plane by two lattice constants , see eq .",
    "( [ 210 ] ) , resulting in a sudden relaxation of the spring .",
    "consequently , the periodicity of the stick - slip curves in the lfs regime ( a ) and the hfs regime ( b ) equals two lattice constants .",
    "we note that the modulation amplitude of the stick - slip curves ( a ) and ( b ) is about the same , while the mean friction forces developed in both regimes are very different , in spite of the fact the pulling velocity and the normal loads are identical for the curves ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the curve ( c ) depicting the evolution of the friction force in the rolling state is interesting in three respects : its periodicity is notably larger than in the lfs- and hfs - cases ( a ) and ( b ) ; its modulation amplitude is also surprisingly high ; the slope of the curve in a stick phase is much smaller than in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "these peculiarities can be explained as follows .",
    "the periodicity of the `` stick - roll '' curve ( c ) is equal to the distance travelled by the upper plane during the `` slip '' @xcite .",
    "this distance is quite large , because the `` slip '' event , seen as the sudden drop of the friction force , is associated not with the transition of the nanoparticle by one lattice constant , but with its rotation by an angle @xmath122 from one commensurate contact state to the next . during this rotation",
    ", the particle s center of mass travels a distance of about @xmath139 .",
    "the actual distance is slightly smaller than this value , because the nanoparticle is not perfectly round . in view of eq .",
    "( [ 210 ] ) , the periodicity of the curve ( c ) twice that value , that is , slightly smaller @xmath140 . for @xmath141 ,",
    "this gives the periodicity that should be a bit smaller than 16 lattice constants .",
    "the periodicity of the curve ( c ) is indeed 14 lattice constants .",
    "the second interesting feature is a roughly ten - fold larger amplitude of force variations in the rolling state compared to the lfs- and hfs - curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in spite of the fact that the normal load is two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "as it turns out , the reason is precisely the much smaller normal load . in each stick phase",
    ", the elastic energy of the spring constantly builds up and is suddenly released to induce a rotation of the nanoparticle in the rolling state from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) . at the same time , the nanoparticle in the stick phase can slightly turn and lift the top plane up against the small normal load .",
    "since part of the torque applied to the particle by the spring is used to lift the upper plane , a much larger elastic force is necessary to induce the particle s rotation , implying a large modulation amplitude of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) . for the curves from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , on the other hand , the normal load is too high to allow for any significant lifting of the upper plane , so that practically all of the force accumulated in the stick phase is used to initiate the slip .",
    "finally , the observed rate of force increase in the stick phase of the rotational regime ( c ) is much smaller than in the sliding regimes ( a ) and ( b ) for a similar reason .",
    "the rate of force increase in the stick phase is determined by an effective spring constant , @xmath142 , which is given by a combination of the elasticity of the spring @xmath0 attached to the upper plane and the spring constant of the nanoparticle s contacts with both planes , @xmath143 . since this",
    "`` contact '' spring is attached to the spring of the upper plane in series , the combination rule is @xmath144 , meaning that @xmath145 . in view of the large difference in the normal load ,",
    "the contact in the sliding regimes ( a ) and ( b ) is much more rigid than in the rolling regime ( c ) .",
    "this implies a much smaller effective spring constant in the case ( c ) than in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) , and a smaller rate of force increase .     from eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] . here , the rotation angle [ fig .  [ fig4](b ) ] in the stick phase has the value @xmath149 , meaning that the nanoparticle contacts the planes along its `` incommensurate '' facets . in the end of such a stick phase ,",
    "the nanoparticle first quickly rotates by an angle of @xmath132 and enters another short - lived stick phase , where the contact is formed along the `` commensurate '' facets of the nanoparticle .",
    "then , another rotation into an incommensurate state occurs , and the process repeats itself . as a result , the force evolution curve acquires an additional structure , with different stick phases corresponding to different particle - surface contacts .",
    "we note that the force curve observed in the carbon nanotube rolling experiments @xcite also possesses a rather complex structure , presumably because of the variation of the contact properties of the nanotube `` facets '' .      the coexistence of the lfs and hfs states in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] opens the possibility of switching between them by changing the control parameters , @xmath131 and @xmath1 .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "starting with the hfs - state within the coexistence region at @xmath137 and @xmath148 , we reduce the normal load to @xmath150 keeping the velocity constant , fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "this brings the system into that region of the state diagram from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where the lfs - state is the only stable one and induces a rotation of the nanoparticle by @xmath132 .",
    "restoring the normal load to its initial value brings the nanoparticle back into the coexistence region , but now its contact with both planes goes along the incommensurate sides .    in order to switch the nanoparticle back into the hfs state , one can increase the pulling velocity to a larger value , thus bringing the system out of the coexistence region into the hfs part of the state diagram , see fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "this results in a sudden stretching of the spring and , correspondingly , in a large spike of the elastic force .",
    "after the nanoparticles has rotated into the hfs configuration , the velocity is reduced to the initial value in the coexistence region of the state diagram . again ,",
    "this velocity reduction results in a sudden relaxation of the spring and in the large negative spike in the friction force .",
    "after that spike , the friction force stabilizes at a high value corresponding to the hfs - state of the system .",
    "to summarize , we have considered the rolling and sliding motion regimes of a cylindrical crystalline nanoparticle between two crystalline planes and found that the rolling state of motion is stable for sufficiently weak normal loads and fast pulling .",
    "an intriguing feature of the state diagram from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the existence of the stability island of the lfs state , where the contact between the nanoparticle and the planes is incommensurate .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the finding of refs .  , where the hfs commensurable state was the only stable one .",
    "the reason for this difference is that , in the works , the flat nanoparticle was rotating around the axis perpendicular to the planes , while in our work , the rotation axis is parallel to the planes and perpendicular to the direction of motion .",
    "we have shown that using nanoparticles as a lubricant , one can achieve either low or high friction at the same values of normal load and pulling velocity .",
    "this finding is at variance with the results from refs .  , where adjustment of these parameters was essential for friction control , so that different friction regimes could be realized only for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath131 .",
    "even though the results reported in this paper have been obtained for the special case of equal lattice constants of the nanoparticle and the planes , we have found qualitatively similar behaviour also in the case of unequal lattice constants .",
    "the fact that some facets of the nanoparticle are commensurate or incommensurate with the surfaces facilitates the discussion of the results , but is not central for the physical mechanism underlying the friction states of the nanoparticle .",
    "what is important is that different facets of the nanoparticle are characterized by different interaction energies with the surfaces .",
    "if this condition is fulfilled , then several sliding states and the rolling state can be realized , even when all facets are incommensurate with the surfaces , or if they are commensurate , but differ in the number of contact atoms .    in our analysis ,",
    "several important effects have been neglected , such the nanoparticle s possible asymmetry , inertia effects , and the effect of thermal noise .",
    "all these effects , when properly taken into account , may lead to qualitatively new friction regimes . in particular , nanoparticles of other shapes can exhibit different state diagrams and , correspondingly , can allow for different friction switching mechanisms .",
    "for instance , if the nanoparticle is asymmetric , it can stick to one plane and slide against the other ; or it can slide with respect to both planes , but with the velocity very different from half the velocity of the upper plane .",
    "next , the effects of thermal noise are typically negligible compared to load and interaction forces .",
    "however , in the systems where noise effects play a significant role , the nanoparticle is expected to spontaneously perform thermally induced transitions between the lfs and the hfs states within the coexistence region , so that higher normal loads would be required to stabilize them . in this case , one can expect the appearance of new regions in the state diagram , where friction is controlled by thermal noise .",
    "finally , inertia introduces new characteristic time scales into the problem  the inverse resonance frequencies of the nanoparticle s vertical , horizontal , and angular oscillations within the potential of the two surfaces .",
    "if the time of pulling by one lattice constant , @xmath151 , becomes comparable to any of these time scales , new friction regimes associated with the nanoparticle s resonant motion can be expected .",
    "exploring new friction regimes related to these and possibly other factors can be an exciting subject for future research , both theoretical and experimental .",
