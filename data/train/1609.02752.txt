    "silo discharge and the flow of granulates through narrow orifices are important ubiquitously in everyday life and in technological processes .",
    "a huge number of experimental , as well as numerical studies have been performed over many years to understand the underlying processes ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "the spontaneous formation of arches  @xcite , the kinetics preceding arch formation @xcite , forces and force chains  @xcite , and arch breaking @xcite are among the important features when one is interested in the prevention of silo clogging .",
    "the formation of arches , i. e. arrangements of grains at the outlet of a two - dimensional hopper that block outflow , was analyzed in a pioneering study by to et al .",
    "@xcite . for disks in a two dimensional silo , they found that the arch span is always larger than the opening of the silo and that for frictionless particles the arch is convex everywhere . introducing friction they found clogging events where the arch at the opening may not be convex locally .",
    "in addition , they determined the jamming probability as a function of the size of the hopper opening .",
    "clogging probabilities were also measured not only for spheres but also for one type of elongated grains by zuriguel et al .",
    "@xcite in a three dimensional silo . in their model ,",
    "the mean avalanche size between two clogging events could be fitted with a power law .",
    "the model assumes a critical radius @xmath0 of the orifice , above which the hopper outflow is continuous , without clogging .",
    "however , the divergence of the mean avalanche size with increasing orifice radius @xmath1 according to the model in ref .",
    "@xcite is proportional to @xmath2 , so it is very difficult to confirm the existence of such a critical radius experimentally with reasonable amounts of grains available .",
    "recent work by thomas and durian @xcite brought new insights in clogging probabilities , flow rates and mean avalanche sizes in hoppers of different geometries .",
    "they proposed a description of clogging events based on an assumed poisson distribution of clogging events .",
    "their model yields an exponential increase of avalanche sizes with increasing hopper orifice radius , so that no critical @xmath0 exists .",
    "these two descriptions are not much distinct from a practical point of view , when one assumes that the critical hole size is defined by clogging events becoming highly improbable and practically unobservable above a certain radius .    since silo discharge is important for many processes in everyday life and the industry , a large number of studies",
    "have been performed both experimentally and numerically over years in order to understand silo dynamics  @xcite , including horizontal apertures  @xcite or tubes  @xcite .",
    "related phenomena where a distinct number of objects has to pass a bottleneck , for example escape panics  @xcite , traffic jams  @xcite and animal behavior  @xcite , are in several respects similar to silo outflow .",
    "the geometrical features of force chains and arches before and in the clogged state can be visualized using photoelastic disks @xcite in 2d hoppers . during the outflow , arches form in the granular material even in regions well above the orifice of the silo , but they are dynamic and form only intermittent networks of contact forces .",
    "the outflow is not controlled by this network , but the network of contact forces is responsible for fluctuations in the velocity field .",
    "clogging occurs in 2d by the formation of an arch with an uninterrupted force chain at the orifice .",
    "this structure remains static unless it is broken by external forces . in 3d",
    ", one expects an analogous scenario .",
    "internal force chains are much more difficult to visualize there than in 2d , therefore a detailed characterization of 3d clogs is still missing",
    ". we will refer to these structures in the following as domes , the 3d analogies of a 2d arch , meaning a shell of grains at the outlet forming a closed net of force chains above the orifice .",
    "until now , many investigations of hopper flow were focused on spherical ( 3d ) or disk shaped ( 2d ) particles with only a few studies providing data for shape - anisotropic grains , for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to quantify how the discharge rate is affected by changing the particle aspect ratio , numerical ( dem ) methods are the most appropriate . here",
    "one can tune the aspect ratio by leaving the other important parameters ( particle volume , surface friction , etc . ) the same .",
    "the aspect ratio dependence is not well understood yet , as in 2d systems cleary and sawley found reduced flow rates for elongated particles with _",
    "friction @xcite , while langston found increased flow rates for elongated particles with _",
    "friction @xcite compared to the case of circles . in 3d simulations",
    "langston found the same flow rate for sphere and sphero - cylinders with zero friction @xcite , while liu found a reduced flow rates for both prolate and oblate ellipsoids with nonzero friction @xcite . on",
    "the other hand li reported increased flow rates for oblate ellipsoids with nonzero friction @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the flow field also depended on the aspect ratio , as the flow was rather concentrated to a central zone for nonspherical grains resulting in a larger stagnant zone near the silo walls @xcite .",
    "the consequences of anisometric grain shape for the static and dynamic properties of granular systems have been highlighted in various recent communications @xcite and reviews @xcite .",
    "some examples are effects of particle elongation on disordered packing @xcite , self - organized criticality on a heap @xcite , ordering in shaken systems @xcite or secondary convection in cylindrical shear flows @xcite .    in the present experimental study",
    ", we analyze the effect of shape anisometry of granular particles on hopper flow and clogging by means x - ray tomography . for this purpose",
    "we use elongated pegs , flat lentils and nearly spherical peas .",
    "these particles have sizes of several millimeters , and can be detected and individually distinguished in the recorded x - ray tomograms .",
    "the silo is a cylindrical bucket with changeable orifice size .",
    "the size is chosen such that clogging occurs after finite avalanche sizes .",
    "the tomograms are recorded in the clogged state with the grains at rest . from comparison of subsequent clogs",
    ", we can characterize the flow field ( streamlines ) of the granulate in the silo .",
    "we find all positions and orientations of individual particles in the clogged state , and use the tomographic data to calculate the packing fractions and particle orientations .",
    "the tomograms also give information about the shape of the domes , as well as on the orientation of particles forming the dome .",
    "the experiments were performed with a small plastic silo consisting of a bucket of a diameter of @xmath3  cm and a height of @xmath4  cm .",
    "the aperture of the outlet was adjustable by exchanging insets in the center of the bottom plane .",
    "the bottom of the bucket has a quadratic opening of about @xmath5  @xmath6 , where different plates with circular holes were inserted , hole sizes could be chosen in 0.5  mm radius steps . a schematic drawing of the silo is shown in fig .  [ fig : aufb1 ] .",

    "the different granulates studied in this setup are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aufb1 ] . to characterize the deviation from the spherical shape we use two different quantities : ( 1 ) the aspect ratio @xmath13 , which is the ratio of the size of the particle along its rotational axis and perpendicular to it and ( 2 ) the equivalent radius @xmath14 which is the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the particle .",
    "the following materials were used :    * wooden pegs with cylinder shape and tapered ends , diameter @xmath15  mm , length @xmath16  mm , aspect ratio @xmath17 , equivalent radius @xmath18  mm * wooden pegs with cylinder shape and tapered ends , @xmath15  mm , @xmath19  mm , @xmath8 , @xmath20  mm * wooden pegs with cylinder shape and tapered ends , @xmath21  mm , @xmath22  mm , @xmath23 , @xmath24  mm * wooden pegs with cylinder shape , @xmath15  mm , @xmath25  mm , @xmath10 , @xmath26  mm * ellipsoidal chocolate lentils ( _ piasten _ ) covered with hard icing with @xmath27  mm and @xmath28  mm , @xmath29 , @xmath30  mm * peas , with small deviations from a perfect sphere , polydisperse with mean diameter of 7.6  mm , standard deviation 0.23  mm , @xmath31  mm    two types of pegs ( q = 8 , 3.3 ) and some of the particles of the other two types ( q = 5 , 2 ) have slight axial groves on their surfaces .    for the preparation of the experiment , the silo outlet is closed first .",
    "then the container is filled with the grains .",
    "we have selected the outlet sizes for the individual grain types such that after the bottom hole is opened , the granulate flows out but clogs after an appropriate time .",
    "the conditions for a well prepared state are that the avalanche is sufficiently large to create a representative flow and alignment pattern in the container , and that the avalanche stops by clogging when there is still enough material in the container cover more than the region covered in the subsequent tomogram . in this clogged state ,",
    "an x - ray tomogram of the lower half of the silo is recorded .",
    "we use the robot - based flat panel x - ray c - arm system siemens artis zeego of the stimulate - lab , otto von guericke university , magdeburg .",
    "the chosen spatial resolution was 2.03 pixel / mm , with recorded volumes of 25.2 cm @xmath32 25.2 cm @xmath32 19 cm .",
    "the 3d arrangement of the particles is then determined from the x - ray tomogram .    to calculate the packing density in different parts of the silo",

    "we define a threshold for all voxels , that determines whether the voxel belongs to a grain or not . for that we have to choose carefully the threshold .",

    "summation over a large number of particles is needed . as a compromise",
    ", we make the assumption that the flow in the axially symmetric geometry of our silo yields an axially symmetric mean flow field and consequently an axially symmetric mean arrangement of the particles , therefore , we average over ring - shaped zones of the silo .    conventionally , the nematic order parameter @xmath34 is the eigenvalue of the order tensor with the largest absolute value . in the case",
    "@xmath36 ( preferential alignment along a certain axis ) , we will refer to @xmath34 in the definition of flow alignment and define the average flow orientation angle @xmath43 as the angle between @xmath33 ( the eigenvector of @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath34 ) and the local flow direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram](a ) .    in regions with strong planar influences , i.e. near walls and close to the free surface ,",
    "the orientational ordering of the particles is often fan - like : the axes of the particles are preferentially aligned perpendicular to a certain axis , but azimuthally more or less distributed at random . in that case , @xmath38 has two small positive eigenvalues , and the third one ( @xmath34 ) is negative and has the largest absolute value ( recall that @xmath38 is traceless ) . in that case , we use a different , more descriptive concept to characterize the local alignment : the eigenvector @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath34 marks the direction in which the particles are preferentially _ not _ oriented .",

    "[ fig : theta_s_q5]a we represented the two other parameters ( the average orientation of the particles and the nematic order parameter ) by ellipses .",

    "the area of the ellipse is proportional to the projection of the average orientation of the particles to the @xmath46 plane . in the flowing region",
    "the rods are aligned due to shear in this plane , so we find ellipses with large area . near the vertical walls , however , the particles are mostly oriented tangentially , thus the area of the ellipse is small . the direction of alignment is reflected in the orientation of the ellipses",

    "thus @xmath52 ( perfect order ) would be represented by a thin line , and @xmath53 ( isotropic state ) by a circle .",
    "all the above applies for usual ( calamitic ) nematic order , @xmath54 , where the largest absolute - value eigenvalue of @xmath55 coincides with the largest eigenvalue ( full ellipses ) . for the fan - shape oriented case , where the eigenvalue with largest absolute - value is negative ( @xmath56 ) , we draw an empty ellipse with flattening @xmath57 . in those cases the short ( of length `` @xmath51 '' ) semi - axis",
    "is oriented to the axis of the corresponding eigenvector of the order tensor . at these locations ,",

    "altogether , figure [ fig : theta_s_q5 ] shows that in the flowing ( sheared ) regions we find well oriented rods due to the shear flow , while near the walls tangential alignment is preferred due to the boundary conditions .",
    "we see , that in the shear flow the average orientation is not parallel to the streamlines , but there is a flow alignment angle as expected @xcite .",
    "the sheared regions are characterized with lower packing fraction , consistent with our earlier observation in shear flow , where the shear induced dilation was found to be only partially compensated with a slight density increase due to the ordering of the grains @xcite .    in order to accurately characterize the alignment of the particles in this complex flow field ,",

    "@xmath59 is increasing , the order parameter rapidly increases and by @xmath60 , it already reaches about @xmath61 . during this time , the average alignment angle strongly decreases from about @xmath62 to about @xmath63 as a consequence of the continuous rotation of the rods due to the shear flow . when the sample is sheared further ( above @xmath64 )",
    ", a stationary state is reached which is characterized by a shear alignment angle of about @xmath65 . in this state",
    "the particles still rotate , but their rotational velocity strongly depends on their orientation , with slow rotation around @xmath66 , resulting in an ensemble averaged alignment of the sample .",
    "this dataset was obtained from 90 x - ray tomograms in the cylindrical split bottom geometry .",
    "focusing on the orientation of the particles in the hopper ( see colored data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta - streamlines]a ) , we find that a good part of the sample is well ordered with similar values of @xmath34 and @xmath43 ( see blue data points ) as in stationary shear flow .",
    "this is the region right above the outlet ( indicated with blue ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta - streamlines]b , where the sample was exposed to the largest shear deformation .",
    "further upstream where the material was sheared less , we find a smaller order parameter and a larger alignment angle , similarly to the initial stages of the case of simple shear ( see regions with light blue , green , yellow and red colors in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta - streamlines]a - b ) . in order to better track the evolution of the particle orientation in the hopper flow , we present the histogram of the particle orientations for 3 regions in our hopper in fig .",

    "[ fig : theta - streamlines]c we also show the histogram of angles of stationary split bottom couette flow ( black line ) .",
    "we see that near the outlet ( blue curve ) the angular distribution almost reached the case of stationary shear .",
    "coming back to fig .",
    "[ fig : theta - streamlines]a , it is remarkable , that the data points taken in the hopper are almost all below the black line ( corresponding to the case of simple shear ) . physically , the difference between the two cases is , that in the hopper the streamlines are strongly converging while in the cylindrical split bottom geometry they run parallel with each other .",
    "thus in the hopper the converging flow leads to particle orientations which are closer to the streamlines than in a simple shear flow .",
    "so far we have presented the flow and orientation fields and the packing density of the particles for one type of pegs ( @xmath8 ) in a hopper . for this we used 26 tomograms , with small particle displacement ( small avalanches ) between the tomograms , so that the flow lines could be identified . in the following , we present the packing density distribution in a hopper for six materials . for these plots , a similar number of tomograms was taken for each material , but here we allowed more grains to flow out of the hopper between subsequent measurements ( compare outlet diameters ) to reduce correlation in the arrangement of the grains .",

    "[ fig : dichten_alle ] , the density is reduced in the sheared region ( compared to the density in the stagnant zone near the walls ) for all materials due to the shear induced dilation . as expected , the density in the stagnant zone @xmath67 decreases with increasing aspect ratio for all rodlike grains .",
    "the region where @xmath67 was determined is marked with a black rectangle on the images .",
    "the shear induced dilation is stronger for rods , compared to the case of nearly spherical particles ( peas ) .",
    "approaching the outlet from the top along the symmetry axis of the hopper we find a decreasing packing density .",
    "near the outlet there is a practically empty region ( marked with blue ) , the region below the dome .",
    "the upper border of this region corresponds to the dome which holds the material above in this clogged configuration .",
    "we indicated this with a black line , corresponding to @xmath68 of the packing fraction observed in the stagnant zone .",
    "the contour of a hemisphere of equal diameter with the outlet is also marked ( as a white line ) to visualize deviations from a spherical shape . analyzing the shape of the dome , we find that its height decreases with particle elongation for the sequence @xmath69 . for lentils and nearly spherical peas",
    "the dome is similar to the case of @xmath9 .    for pegs with @xmath7",
    "we find a higher dome , we note however , that these particles are relatively large compared to the system size , thus boundary effects might already have an influence in this case .",
    "we should also note that boundaries also induce layering of the particles especially near the bottom wall , where anisometric particles lay flat . in the stagnant zones near the boundaries the inhomogeneities of the density field are stronger compared to the flowing regions , since there is less averaging over different configurations .",
    "we presented experimental data about the packing fraction , grain alignment , orientational order parameter , and flow field in a 3d hopper based on x - ray ct measurements .",
    "we analyzed subsequent clogged states for 6 materials including elongated particles ( pegs ) , lentils , and nearly spherical grains ( peas ) .",
    "we have shown that for elongated particles the grains get ordered in the flowing parts of the silo . similarly to the case of simple shear flows the average orientation of the rods is not parallel to the streamlines but encloses a small angle with it .",
    "the order parameter increases as the grains travel downwards the silo and the local shear deformation grows . in most parts of the hopper",
    "the orientational distribution of the grains did not reach the stationary orientational distribution observed for simpler shear flows .",
    "consequently , in these regions the order parameter is smaller and the average alignment encloses a larger angle with the streamlines than in a simple shear flow . the packing density of the material is smaller in the flowing ( sheared ) regions compared to the stagnant zones .",
    "this density decrease is stronger for elongated grains compared to the case of nearly spherical particles ( peas ) . along the vertical symmetry axis of the hopper the density continuously decreases from top to bottom .    near the outlet the density distribution averaged over many clogged configurations",
    "provides information about the shape of a typical dome , i.e. the last layer of the grains which blocked the flow .",
    "a characteristic feature is the ratio of hole diameter and elevation of the dome above the outlet in the center .",
    "we find that the height of the dome decreases with increasing aspect ratio for pegs with @xmath10 @xmath70 @xmath9 @xmath70 @xmath8 .",
    "this has consequences for the average number of grains that are involved in the formation of the clog , and therefore also for the clogging probability , the avalanche statistics and the critical radius for the divergence of the mean avalanche sizes .",
