    "femtosecond lasers create extreme nonequilibrium conditions in matter , namely , one with hot electrons and cold ions @xcite .",
    "this is primarily because laser light interacts very strongly with electrons but not with ions , and secondarily because the electrons thermalize relatively slowly with the ions compared with the time needed for ultrafast structural changes ( typically several ps vs several @xmath5 s of fs ) .",
    "the possibility of heating the electrons in a material with an ultrafast laser pulse without immediately changing the temperature of the ions has paved the way to the discovery of interesting physical phenomena , such as , perhaps most importantly , laser - induced phase transitions that can not be explained by the heating of the ions , but are caused by a change of the electronic bonding properties .    in arsenic a series of pressure - induced phase transitions exists . at ambient conditions as crystallizes in the a7 structure . at @xmath6 gpa",
    "there is a transition to the simple cubic ( sc ) phase @xcite , followed by transitions @xcite to the so - called as(iii ) structure at @xmath7 gpa and to body - centered cubic as at @xmath8 gpa .",
    "the fact that as in the a7 structure is electronically stabilized by the peierls mechanism @xcite makes it a candidate for an ultrafast laser - induced solid - solid phase transition .",
    "this is of fundamental interest , because the majority of the experimentally studied laser - induced phase transitions shows ultrafast melting , for example , in si @xcite , gaas @xcite , te @xcite , and insb @xcite .",
    "examples of laser - induced solid - solid phase transitions are a disorder - to - disorder transition in amorphous gesb @xcite , a metallic - to - semiconductor phase transition in sms @xcite , a monoclinic - to - rutile transition in vo@xmath9 @xcite , a ferromagnetic - to - paramagnetic transition in copt@xmath10 alloy films @xcite , and an antiferromagnetic - to - ferromagnetic phase transition in ferh @xcite .",
    "the main topic of this paper is to analyze the possibility to induce a solid - solid phase transition by an ultrafast laser pulse in as under pressure .",
    "we now describe the relationship between the a7 and sc structures , the two phases of as between which we will predict a laser - induced transition ( see section [ sec_results ] ) . starting from an sc atomic packing",
    ", the a7 structure can be derived in two steps , which are illustrated in .",
    "first the sc lattice is deformed by elongating it along one of the body diagonals ( indicated by @xmath11 in figure [ fig_a7 ] ) .",
    "relation between the a7 and sc structures .",
    "a ) the sc structure .",
    "the lattice vectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 belong to the a7 structure ( the sc structure is a special case of the a7 structure ) .",
    "b ) intermediate structure . compared to a ) the unit cell of the sc lattice is elongated along the vector @xmath14 keeping the volume per atom constant .",
    "the new positions of the atoms are shown together with a cube of the sc lattice .",
    "c ) the a7 structure of as at ambient pressure . compared to b ) the atomic planes perpendicular to @xmath14 are displaced alternatingly in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions due to a peierls distortion . the cube still represents the sc structure of a ) , for reference . below a ) ",
    "c ) projections of the atomic planes onto @xmath14 are shown.,width=453 ]    the magnitude of this deformation is usually expressed by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the length of the lattice vector @xmath14 and @xmath18 is the length of @xmath12 ( ) . in the sc lattice @xmath19 . in the second step a peierls instability causes the atoms to be displaced along the same diagonal , in opposite directions ( ) .",
    "the magnitude of the displacements is expressed by the atomic coordinate @xmath20 : a value of @xmath21 indicates no peierls distortion .",
    "deviations from @xmath22 give the magnitude of the displacement of the atoms in the @xmath14 direction . in as at ambient pressure @xmath23 @xcite , which leads to a displacement of the atoms amounting to @xmath24 of the average distance between the planes [ see ( c ) ] .",
    "to determine the phase of as under pressure before the laser excitation when the electrons are in their ground state we compared the enthalpies of the a7 and sc phases , which were computed in the following way .",
    "( i ) we calculated total energies for a series of unit cell volumes with the computer program wien2k @xcite .",
    "this is an all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave code , which has been designed to make very accurate predictions for solids within the limitations of density functional theory @xcite . for the sc structure",
    "these calculations are straightforward , because there are no internal parameters . however , for the a7 structure the energy is a function of both volume and the internal parameters @xmath16 and @xmath20 described in the introduction . in this case",
    "we minimized the total energy at each volume by optimizing the @xmath16 ratio and the peierls distortion parameter @xmath20 .",
    "( ii ) we fitted the total energy vs volume data for the sc phase to the birch - murnaghan equation of state @xcite , which has been derived for systems with cubic symmetry .",
    "the fitting parameters of this equation of state are the minimal total energy @xmath25 , the corresponding atomic volume @xmath26 , the bulk modulus @xmath27 , and the first derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure @xmath28 .",
    "( iii ) we fitted the computed energy differences between the a7 and sc structures to @xmath29 we found that this form described our a7 data much better than when the total energies of the a7 structure are fitted directly to the birch - murnaghan equation of state @xcite . ( iv )",
    "we calculated the enthalpies @xmath30 for the sc and a7 structures from the analytical fits for the total energy and @xmath31 .    to describe as after laser excitation we use the following physical picture :",
    "the laser pulse creates electrons and holes , which undergo dephasing and collisions on a timescale that is much shorter than the typical time of ionic motion ( @xmath32 fs , based on the @xmath33 optical @xmath34-point phonon frequency of as in its equilibrium structure ) .",
    "therefore one can for all practical purposes assume that the excited carriers thermalize instantaneously .",
    "the effect of the excitation by an ultrashort laser pulse was thus simulated by heating the electrons . in this case , the phase stability is governed by the free energy @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the electronic temperature and @xmath37 is the electronic entropy ( to be sure , the free energy was also used for the ground state calculations , but since the electronic temperature was very low in that case and was used for smearing purposes only , we have ignored this point for the sake of clarity of presentation in the discussion above ) . note that the entropic contribution of the ions to the free energy was neglected .",
    "this is because we assumed that both the laser pulse duration and the timescale on which the phase transition takes place are much shorter than the electron - ion interaction time , so that no substantial heating of the ions due to the laser occurs during the time of interest .",
    "another consequence of the short timescales that we are looking at is that the system does not have time to expand , so that structural changes should be assumed to take place at constant volume .",
    "therefore , we compared the free energies of the a7 and sc structures to predict under which conditions a phase transition takes place in as under pressure .",
    "details of our wien2k calculations were as follows .",
    "we used the generalized gradient approximation @xcite for the exchange and correlation energy . our basis consisted of plane waves with energies less than or equal to @xmath38 ry .",
    "inside the so - called muffin - tin spheres around each atom the plane waves were augmented by atomic orbitals with a linearized energy dependence . to get a better convergence with respect to the number of plane waves included in the basis the _",
    "4s _ , and _",
    "4p _ states were described with a combination @xcite of energy independent augmented plane waves and local orbitals .",
    "also , additional local orbitals @xcite were added for the _",
    "3d _ and the _ 4s _ states .",
    "the first brillouin zone of the a7 structure was sampled using a grid of @xmath39 k points excluding the @xmath34 point , which corresponds to @xmath40 irreducible k points . to rule out errors due to , for example , a different k - space sampling and to allow for a detailed comparison between the a7 and the sc structures , the latter structure was also computed as an a7 structure with the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath20 fixed to their sc values @xmath42 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the electronic ground state calculations were performed using temperature smearing ( @xmath43 mry ) to determine the electronic occupation numbers . for the laser - excited state an electronic temperature of @xmath44 mry was used .",
    "this choice corresponds to an absorbed laser energy of @xmath45 mry / atom or , equivalently , the creation of @xmath46 electron - hole pairs per unit cell ( when the atomic volume @xmath47 @xmath2/atom ) .",
    "since we assumed an instantaneous thermalization of the excited carriers , our predicted results do not depend directly on the energy of the phonons , but only on the total absorbed energy per atom .",
    "the incident laser fluence that leads , at the sample surface , to the above - mentioned value of @xmath48 is , however , a function of both the reflectivity and the penetration depth of the laser light , which are dependent on the laser wavelength .",
    "a complication is that these dependencies might change due to an applied pressure and under the influence of the laser irradiation .",
    "ignoring these latter points and using a laser wavelength of @xmath49 nm we estimated our incident fluence to be @xmath50 mj/@xmath51 ( for this wavelength the reflectivity is @xmath52 @xcite and the penetration depth is @xmath53 nm , based on the experimentally determined complex dielectric constant of @xmath54 @xcite ) . here",
    "we would further like to mention that we assumed the laser pulse duration to be much shorter than the timescale of ionic motion ( @xmath32 fs ) .",
    "before turning to the energy vs volume curves , a few words about the equilibrium structure of arsenic are at place , because this allows us to get a rough idea about the quality of the predictions that the gga @xcite we used is able to make . according to our calculations",
    "the ground state parameters of as in the a7 structure are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 @xmath2/atom .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the measured values @xmath58 , @xmath23 , and @xmath59 @xmath2/atom @xcite . as was to be expected , our atomic volume @xmath60 is larger than the experimental value @xcite by about @xmath61 , which is consistent with the general trend of the gga to overestimate bond lengths , and in agreement with the value of @xmath62 @xmath2/atom recently obtained from gga calculations by shang and co - workers @xcite .",
    "from calculations for smaller atomic volumes we concluded that our too large values for the magnitude of the peierls distortion ( @xmath63 ) and for @xmath16 can in part but not entirely be understood as a consequence of the overestimated unit cell volume .",
    "the total energies of the sc and a7 structures as a function of atomic volume are shown in figure [ fig_fit ] .",
    "these data are for the electronic ground state , i.e. , before laser excitation .     total ground state energy vs volume for sc as and as in the a7 structure .",
    "the solid curve shows the birch - murnaghan fit to the data for the sc structure .",
    "the inset shows the energy difference @xmath64 ( plusses ) and the fit to ( solid curve ) .",
    "the volume @xmath65 at which the a7 structure becomes energetically favored over the sc one is indicated.,width=302 ]    the parameters obtained from the fits to the birch - murnaghan equation of state and , which we made using the data points plotted in figure [ fig_fit ] and the inset of figure [ fig_fit ] , respectively , are given in table [ table_fit ] .",
    "ccc & @xmath43 mry & @xmath44 mry + @xmath26 ( @xmath2/atom ) & @xmath66 & @xmath67 + @xmath27 ( gpa ) & @xmath68 & @xmath69 + @xmath28 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + @xmath65 ( @xmath2/atom ) & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 + @xmath77 ( mry / atom ) & @xmath78 & @xmath79 +    from figure [ fig_fit ] it is apparent that our fits follow the computed data very closely .",
    "indeed , the root mean square of the residuals was only @xmath80 mry / atom for the birch - murnaghan fit and @xmath81 mry / atom for the fit to .",
    "the enthalpy of the a7 structure relative to the enthalpy of the sc structure as a function of pressure is plotted in figure [ fig_enth ] .",
    "enthalpy difference @xmath82 as a function of pressure .",
    "the inset shows the indicated region enlarged .",
    "the transition from the a7 to the sc structure takes place at a pressure of @xmath0 gpa.,width=302 ]    in a narrow pressure range multiple solutions exist for the enthalpy of the a7 structure , as is shown in the inset of figure [ fig_enth ] . of course , the solution with the lowest enthalpy is the stable one .",
    "a consequence of these multiple solutions is that the enthalpies of the a7 and sc structures cross and that the transition point from the a7 to the sc structure can thus easily be determined . from figure [ fig_enth ]",
    "we see that the transition takes place at @xmath0 gpa , in reasonable agreement with earlier gga calculations by hussermann and co - workers @xcite , who found the transition pressure to be @xmath83 gpa .",
    "another consequence of the multiple solutions seen in the inset of figure [ fig_enth ] is that the unstable solutions , corresponding to a narrow range of possible atomic volumes , are not realized for any given pressure , which means that there is a small volume change at the transition , which according to our calculations is @xmath84 .",
    "both the transition pressure and the volume change are in nearly perfect agreement with the experimental values of beister and co - workers @xcite , who have found the transition at a pressure of @xmath85 gpa accompanied by a volume change @xmath86 .",
    "we did not find a discontinuity in @xmath16 at the transition , which according to beister and co - workers @xcite jumps from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "however , according to our calculations @xmath20 changes discontinuously from @xmath89 to @xmath21 .",
    "we now describe the effect of an ultrashort laser pulse .",
    "as we have already argued in section [ sec_method ] the timescale that we are interested in is too short for the system to expand .",
    "therefore we present results at constant volume , and we only briefly discuss the effect of pressure at the end of this paragraph .",
    "our optimized @xmath16 ratio and peierls parameter @xmath20 as a function of volume for as in the a7 structure are shown in figure [ fig_params ] .",
    "a ) the peierls parameter @xmath20 and b ) the ratio @xmath16 as a function of volume before ( @xmath43 mry ) and after laser excitation ( @xmath44 mry )",
    ". the inset of b ) shows a selected region enlarged .",
    "arrows in a ) and the inset of b ) indicate the possibility of a laser - induced phase transition at constant volume from the a7 to the sc structure.,width=302 ]    it can be seen that the pressure - induced phase transition from the a7 to the sc structure occurs at a larger volume when the electrons have been heated with a laser compared to when they are in their ground state . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to induce a phase transition at constant volume from the a7 to the sc structure in as under pressure .",
    "we have indicated this possibility for a specific volume ( @xmath47 @xmath2/atom ) by two arrows in figure [ fig_params ] .",
    "the corresponding potential energy surfaces before and after laser excitation are shown in .     potential energy surface contour plot of as a ) before and b ) after laser - excitation as a function of the internal parameters @xmath20 and @xmath16 at the volume @xmath47 @xmath90atom .",
    "whereas the energy minimum of as before laser - excitation is relatively sharp ( the two minima shown are equivalent ) , the minimum after laser - excitation is broader .",
    "the minimum in b ) is located at the sc values of @xmath20 and @xmath16 ( @xmath21 and @xmath88 , respectively).,width=302 ]    when the electrons are in the ground state this volume corresponds to an applied calculated pressure of @xmath3 gpa .",
    "the optimized ratio @xmath91 and the peierls parameter @xmath92 indicate that the system is in the a7 phase . after the laser excitation",
    "the optimal @xmath16 and @xmath20 become @xmath93 and @xmath21 , respectively , signifying that as has made the transition to the sc structure . at this",
    "given volume , the internal pressure in laser - excited as has dropped to @xmath94 gpa .",
    "if the system were given enough time to adjust to the applied pressure of @xmath3 gpa , the volume would , according to our calculations , decrease to @xmath95 @xmath2/atom , in which case the simple cubic phase would clearly still be the most stable one ( see figure [ fig_params ] ) .",
    "comparing the free energies of the a7 and sc structures it follows that the a7 to sc transition in as can , in principle , be induced for atomic volumes up to @xmath96 @xmath90atom ( @xmath44 mry data in table [ table_fit ] ) , which corresponds to an applied pressure of @xmath97 gpa .",
    "however , near the transition point the potential energy surface of as becomes very flat ( see ) , and as a consequence the uncertainty in the optimized @xmath16 and @xmath20 values becomes relatively large , which explains why in figure [ fig_params ] the @xmath16 ratio and @xmath20 peierls parameter start to deviate from their sc values at volumes less than @xmath98 @xmath90atom ( but greater than @xmath47 @xmath90atom ) .",
    "so , in order to be on the safe side and to avoid any ambiguity about the final state after the laser excitation , the lowest pressure for which we feel confident to predict an unambiguous transition to the sc structure ( as defined by its @xmath16 and @xmath20 values ) is the value of @xmath3 gpa derived in the previous paragraph .",
    "as can be noted in figure [ fig_params](b ) , the predicted phase transition involves a change in @xmath16 .",
    "since the volume remains constant , in a polycrystalline sample there is no average effect and we expect that the change in @xmath16 takes place on a subpicosecond timescale . in a monocrystal this change might be limited by the sound velocity .",
    "summarizing , we demonstrated that it is possible to induce a solid - solid phase transition in as under pressure using an ultrashort laser pulse .",
    "in particular , for an absorbed laser energy @xmath45 mry / atom , we predicted that the phase transition will be induced under an applied pressure as low as @xmath99 gpa . for higher absorbed energies",
    "we expect that the transition could be induced under an even lower applied pressure .",
    "this transition might be observed using time - resolved x - ray diffraction experiments .",
