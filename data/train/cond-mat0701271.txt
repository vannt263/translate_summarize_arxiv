    "lately , it has been shown that the combination of ferromagnets ( fms ) with superconductors ( scs ) @xcite offers an efficient way to bypass the natural restrictions that exist in plain materials regarding their electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "these fm / sc hybrids are promising for the design of oncoming electronics since the efficient magnetic modulation of the superconducting properties could allow the direct implementation of novel apparatus as fm / sc / fm spin valves .",
    "@xcite although these fm / sc / fm hybrids have attracted much interest @xcite certain discrepancies that have been reported in the recent literature relent the complete understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms .",
    "the present work offers results on the transport properties of exchange biased fms @xcite combined with a low - t@xmath0 sc .",
    "two quite different fms , namely la@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 and ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 , and also various structural topologies have been investigated .",
    "more specifically , mls of la@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 combined with nb in the form of [ la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath3/la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8_{15}$]/nb , and more simple ni@xmath9fe@xmath10/nb / ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 trilayers ( tls ) and ni@xmath9fe@xmath10/nb bilayers ( bls ) are studied .",
    "the aim of our study was to uncover the reasons responsible for the contradictory results that have been reported very recently regarding the transport properties of relative fm / sc / fm spin valves .",
    "@xcite _ a novel feature that is observed in the transport data obtained in all different hybrids is that the exchange bias mechanism enhances the sc s resistive transition_. this surprising experimental fact together with the magnetization data that were reported very recently @xcite , imply that _ the coexistence of exchange bias and superconductivity could have a positive synergetic effect_.",
    "the ml / sc hybrids have the form [ la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath3/la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8_{15}$]/nb with [ d@xmath11/d@xmath12@xmath13/d@xmath14 ( in nm units ) . in these samples",
    "a fm buffer layer with d@xmath15 nm has been used since we expected that this should act as a main reservoir for generating stray fields that , in addition to the exchange bias mechanism , could influence the sc ( see inset ( c ) in fig.[b1](a ) ) .",

    "we should stress that : ( i ) all depositions were carried out _ at room temperature _ and ( ii ) _ no _ magnetic field was applied during the deposition of nife . in order to incorporate the exchange bias only the nife _ bottom _ layers were treated by annealing ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "afterwards , the complete tl and bl structures were deposited on top .",

    "the standard four - point configuration was used , the external magnetic field was applied parallel to the hybrids and the dc - current was normal to the external field ( see insets ( c ) in fig.[b1](a ) and fig.[b3](a ) ) .",

    "we present detailed magnetization m(t ) curves from t@xmath28 k up to t@xmath26 k for the pure ml ( prior to the deposition of the nb layer ) under @xmath27 oe . the data were obtained while the ml was warmed and for two distinct cases : when the ml is initially virgin ( v ) and when biased ( bs ) [ by cooling it from t@xmath32t@xmath16 k under an external field @xmath33 koe that it was lowered to @xmath27 oe when the desired temperature t@xmath28 k was achieved ] .",
    "first of all , we notice that the very small magnetization observed in the v curve in the low - temperature regime clearly indicates that the fm layers are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the magnetization is almost constant up to the n@xmath34el critical temperature of the af layers t@xmath35 k. for t@xmath32t@xmath35 k the v curve increases exhibiting a maximum at around t@xmath36 k and subsequently gets zero as t@xmath16 k is exceeded .",

    "for the same ml / sc hybrids revealed that the exchange bias mechanism influences the sc s magnetic behaviour . in order to investigate if , except for the magnetic behavior , the exchange bias could influence the sc s transport properties we performed resistivity measurements .",
    "representative data are shown in figs.[b2](a ) and [ b2](b ) revealing that the exchange bias mechanism clearly affects the current - carrying capability of our ml / sc hybrids .",
    "measurements were performed while lowering either the applied magnetic field ( upper panel ) or the temperature ( lower panel ) for two different conditions : when the ml was initially bs ( dotted curves ) and when ubs ( solid curves ) [ see also inset ( e ) in fig.[b1](b ) ] .",
    "we observe that the bs curves are placed below the ubs ones .",
    "this is a clear evidence _ that superconductivity is enhanced when the sc experiences the exchange bias imposed by the adjacent ml_.       k up to t@xmath39 k for @xmath40 oe .",

    "inset ( d ) presents isothermal m(h ) curves obtained at t@xmath42 k when the tl was virgin ( solid circles ) and bs ( open circles ) .",
    "the loop obtained under bs condition is shifted by @xmath43 oe when compared to the virgin one.,width=245 ]    in order to investigate the generic character of this result we examined another quite different fm constituent , namely nife combined in two nife / nb / nife tl and nife / nb bl topologies with the sc .",
    "figures [ b3](a ) and [ b3](b ) show in semilogarithmic plots representative results that reveal the existence of exchange bias in a nife / nb / nife tl .",
    "we remind that only the bottom nife layer exhibits exchange bias so that it is called bfm ( `` b '' stands for biased ) , while the as - deposited top nife layer is noted as pfm ( `` p '' stands for plain ) .",
    "panel ( a ) presents the resistive curve from below t@xmath44 k up to t@xmath39 k , while in panel ( b ) presented are the zero field cooled and field cooled m(t ) curves under @xmath41 oe when the sample is virgin .",

    "( b ) although both curves were obtained for bs tl they refer to different applied fields , @xmath46 and @xmath43 oe .",
    "thus , these measurements refer to different magnetization configuration of the outer nife layers : at @xmath46 oe the layers are antiparallel and at @xmath33 oe they are parallel ( see the bs loop in inset ( d ) of fig.[b3](b ) ) .",
    "this information will help us to discuss the recent discrepancies that have been reported @xcite in relevant fm / sc / fm spin valves .",
    "since in all measurements presented in figs.[b2](b ) and [ b4](a)-[b4](b ) the observed temperature shift is very small ( but , at least , comparable to the ones presented in refs . )",
    "we performed some test measurements in order to ensure that these shifts are motivated by the physics of the studied systems and are not coincidental .",
    "the results of panel ( c ) serve this aim since they clearly show that at the symmetric points @xmath47 and @xmath48 oe of the virgin tl the obtained v(t ) curves clearly coincide as they should ( see the virgin loop in inset ( d ) of fig.[b3](b ) ) .",
    "figure [ b5](a ) shows v(h ) curves for a second tl obtained close to its t@xmath49 k. both virgin and bs curves are shown .",
    "firstly , the virgin curves present a broad peak around zero field . as we see from the virgin m(h ) curve in inset ( d ) of fig.[b3](b ) at this field region the tl s magnetization gradually reverses .",
    "this result is identical to the one presented by v. pea et al . in ref .. _ more importantly , here we clearly demonstrate that this peak may be almost entirely suppressed by the application of the exchange bias .",
    "_ figure [ b5](b ) shows the respective v(h ) curves for a bl obtained close to its t@xmath50 k. in both the tl ( panel ( a ) ) and the bl ( panel ( b ) ) we see that while in the normal state the virgin and bs curves coincide , as we enter in the superconducting state these curves diverge , with _ the bs curve placed significantly below the virgin one _ @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the contradictory experimental results @xcite that have been reported in the recent literature for relevant spin valves .",
    "the concept of a sc spin valve is based on a fm / sc / fm tl structure @xcite where the nucleation of superconductivity can be controlled at will by the _ relative _ magnetization configuration of the outer fm layers .",
    "@xcite were the first who reported on the experimental realization of a [ ni@xmath51fe@xmath52-cu@xmath53ni@xmath54/nb/[cu@xmath53ni@xmath55-ni@xmath51fe@xmath52 ] spin valve . in that work @xcite the exchange bias mechanism",
    "was used since an additional fe@xmath57mn@xmath57 layer was introduced in order to control the magnetization of the one fm layer . it was observed that when the magnetizations of the two fm layers were _ antiparallel ( parallel ) _ the resistive transition of the sc was placed at _ higher ( lower ) _ temperatures .",
    "@xcite soon after , a. potenza and c.h .",
    "marrows @xcite , and also i.c .",
    "moraru et al .",
    "@xcite by employing also the exchange bias mechanism confirmed the results of ref . .",
    "contrary to those results @xcite , in the experiments of v. pea et al .",
    "@xcite and of a.yu .",
    "rusanov et al .",
    "@xcite , where la@xmath58ca@xmath59mno@xmath60/yba@xmath61cu@xmath60o@xmath62/la@xmath58ca@xmath59mno@xmath60 and ni@xmath9fe@xmath10/nb / ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 tls were studied respectively , the opposite behavior was observed .",
    "both works @xcite reported that the _ antiparallel ( parallel ) _ magnetization configuration of the fm layers _ suppresses ( enhances ) _ superconductivity .",
    "we stress that in refs .",
    "the exchange bias mechanism was _ not _ employed . according to our results when the sc experiences the exchange bias",
    "its resistive transition is enhanced .",
    "this finding could explain the discrepancies reported in refs .. the results presented in fig.[b4](b ) reveal that the _ antiparallel _ magnetization configuration of the outer nife layers _ suppresses _ superconductivity in agreement with refs ..",
    "k and t@xmath50 k , respectively .",
    "both bs ( open circles ) and virgin ( solid circles ) curves are presented.,width=245 ]    finally , exchange bias @xcite is related to unidirectional magnetic anisotropy and phenomenologically it can be viewed as a parameter that controls the nucleation and orientation of magnetic domains in a fm ; a key parameter for the fm / sc / fm spin valves . since we observed that the parallel magnetic configuration enhances superconductivity we may assume that exchange bias also promotes superconductivity by promoting the alignment of the magnetic domains over the whole fm .",
    "ultimately , this could somehow be related to the existence of a spin - triplet supercurrent @xcite since , according to basic knowledge under such conditions a spin - singlet one should be seriously suppressed due to the detrimental influence of the fm s exchange field .",
    "@xcite more specific experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "summarizing , we presented transport data in [ la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath3/la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8_{15}$]/nb , ni@xmath9fe@xmath10/nb / ni@xmath9fe@xmath10 and ni@xmath9fe@xmath10/nb hybrids .",
    "a novel finding that we observed is that in all different structures the exchange bias mechanism improves the resistive transition of the fm / sc hybrid .",
    "since this feature is independent of the specific fm material and of the structural topology we believe that it should be generic in all fm / sc hybrids .",
    "our experiments assist the understanding of the discrepancies that have been reported in the recent literature regarding relative fm / sc / fm spin valves ."
