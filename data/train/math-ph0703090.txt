    "in this paper we discuss the construction of symmetric polynomials which arise as eigenfunctions of exactly solvable quantum many - body systems of calogero - sutherland type @xcite .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that a particular construction method found and studied by us in simple special cases @xcite can be naturally extended to the full class of such model .",
    "our results provide a unified approach to many - variable generalisations of the classical hermite , lagueree , jacobi and bessel polynomials .",
    "we also show that it is natural to generalise our approach to a larger family of polynomials related to a deformation of the calogero - sutherland type systems found and studied by chalykh , feigin , sergeev , and veselov @xcite .",
    "this allows us to derive , for each such polynomial , a family of different representations labeled by a pair of non - negative integers @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , one can choose @xmath0 such that the representation is simplest , i.e. , a linear combination of certain explicitly given polynomials with the least number of terms .",
    "these results are non - trivial already for the non - deformed polynomials . to mention a specific example",
    ", we find that a jack polynomial @xcite has a @xmath0 representation if there exists a pair of non - negative integers @xmath1 such that the young diagram corresponding to this jack polynomial can be covered by the union of the two rectangular young diagrams of size @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath3 rows and @xmath4 columns ) and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the simplest such representation is obtained by minimizing @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the simplest possible representation of the jack polynomial corresponding to the young diagrams @xmath7 is for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively , and in the first two cases our representation actually consists only of a single term .",
    "the main tool in our construction are certain identities which , to each ( deformed ) calogero - sutherland system , relates a system of the same type . in special cases ,",
    "these identities are well known and related to a duality of the jack polynomials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or , more generally , the algebra homomorphism which maps jack polynomials to so called super jack polynomials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we deduce these identities in a unified manner , and thus unify , as well as extend , previously known results .    while we mention these examples in the beginning to give an impression of the kind of results we obtain , the emphasis in our presentation is on our construction method . to avoid overloading our formulae",
    "we explain this method in detail for the non - deformed polynomials and the representations @xmath11 .",
    "the subsequent extension to the general case is then remarkably easy .      as mentioned above",
    ", the polynomials studied in this paper play an important role in physics since they occur in prominent exactly solvable quantum mechanical models defined by partial differential operators of calogero - sutherland type .",
    "these latter operators play a central role in our construction , and we therefore proceed to explain their relation to the classical hermite , laguerre , jacobi and bessel polynomials . as elaborated below , to each such sequence of one - variable polynomials @xmath12 there exists a quantum mechanical model defined by a schrdinger operator @xmath13 with a particular potential function @xmath14 such that its eigenfunctions are of the form @xmath15 for particular @xmath16 functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is a real variable , and we use the notation @xmath20 ) .",
    "many - variable generalisation of these polynomials appear in the following generalisation to an arbitrary number @xmath21 of particles : each one - particle schrdinger operator allows for a many - body generalisation @xmath22 with @xmath23 a particular two - body interaction potential such that @xmath24 has eigenfunctions @xmath25 which are labelled by integer vectors @xmath26 and are of the form @xmath27 @xmath28 where the functions @xmath29 are certain symmetric polynomials in @xmath21 variables @xmath30 generalising the polynomials @xmath31 . to avoid certain technicalities and since it includes the cases of main physical interests we will assume @xmath32 , even though many of our results actually hold true also for other values of @xmath33 .",
    "we mention already at this point that although the symmetry of the polynomials @xmath29 implies that a complete set of eigenfunctions can be labelled by partitions , i.e. , sequences @xmath34 of non - negative integers",
    "@xmath35 such that @xmath36 , it is in our approach not always natural to make this restriction , as will become evident below .",
    "these operators @xmath24 define exactly solvable quantum - many body systems of calogero - sutherland type @xcite ; see table  [ table1 ] for a list of well - known examples ( note that we have added constants to the potentials @xmath14 to simplify certain formulae later on ) .",
    "a further interesting generalisation of the one - particle schrdinger operators is the following class of differential operators in two sets of variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath21 and @xmath39 are arbitrary non - negative integers : @xmath40 with a potential function @xmath41 of the same kind as @xmath14 but with different parameters , as specified in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "these differential operators are natural generalisations of the schrdinger operator in that they also have polynomial eigenfunctions with corresponding eigenvalues that can be computed explicitly ; see section  [ sec4 ] for a precise formulation of this result . in this paper",
    "we present an explicit construction of all these many - variable generalisations of the above mentioned classical polynomials .",
    "we obtain the results by a unified treatment making no reference to special cases , as explained below .     & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 +    & & & + i & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + ii & 0 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 + & & & + iii & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + & & & + iv & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + & @xmath56 & & @xmath57 + & & & + v & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + & & & + vi & @xmath61 & @xmath59 & @xmath62 + & @xmath63 & & @xmath64 + & & & + vii & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 + & @xmath68 & & @xmath69 +      to explain the nature of our results we now discuss the standard calogero - sutherland cases @xmath70 in more detail .",
    "our approach is based on a set of remarkable identities which provide us with particular sets of symmetric polynomials on which the action of the differential operators is particularly simple .",
    "these latter polynomials can be defined by the following expansion : @xmath71 valid for @xmath72 .",
    "we mention that these polynomials were first defined in @xcite by a certain contour integral .",
    "however , using cauchy s theorem it is easy to verify that the two definitions are equivalent .",
    "we explicitly construct series representations for the polynomials @xmath29 in which are of the form @xmath73 and , in addition , we obtain certain completeness results ; see section 3 for the precise statements .",
    "we will also derive a partial generalisation of these results to the differential operators @xmath74 ; see section 4 .",
    "we thus generalise , unify , and extend various results which were known before only in special cases @xcite .",
    "we now explain in which sense our approach is unified and give a precise definition of the classical polynomials we consider : each such sequence consists of polynomials @xmath31 of order @xmath75 such that they are common eigenfunctions of a differential operator @xmath76 with @xmath77 for some real coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; see table  [ table2 ] for the polynomials corresponding to our examples in table [ table1 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the schrdinger operator @xmath80 in with the eigenfunctions can be fully characterised by these polynomials @xmath81 and @xmath82 : it is straightforward to verify that @xmath83 ( the prime here and in the following indicates differentiation ) with @xmath18 a solution of the differential equation @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 any solution of the differential equation @xmath87 moreover , the potential functions @xmath23 , ensuring that the differential operators @xmath24 in and @xmath74 in have polynomial eigenfunctions , are given by @xmath88 the constant @xmath89 is subtracted to simplify formulae later on , and @xmath41 is given by a formula as in but with @xmath90 replaced by @xmath91/\\kappa.\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that the exact eigenvalues of the differential operators @xmath24 in and @xmath74 in are determined by the leading coefficients of these polynomials @xmath92 and @xmath90 . for example , the exact eigenvalues of @xmath24 corresponding to the eigenfunctions are @xmath93 with @xmath94 this result , well - known in many special cases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , will naturally emerge from our construction in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "we are now in a position to state more precisely in which sense our approach is unified : in our construction information concerning the different cases will enter only via the two polynomials @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "we now discuss the relation of our results to previous work in the literature .",

    "we recall that the super jack polynomials are known to constitute a linear basis for the algebra @xmath439 .",
    "using these two facts above one can show that if @xmath546 and @xmath547 then the reduced eigenfunctions constructed in section [ sec41 ] are also a linear basis for @xmath439 .",
    "if either @xmath548 or @xmath549 then they span only a subspace of @xmath439 which , however , can be given a rather simple characterisation .",
    "a detailed discussion of these facts can be found in the first arxiv version ( v1 ) of @xcite .",
