    "with the launch of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern the particle physics experiments enter a new energy domain with the hope to discover new phenomena .",
    "experimental observations are expected to provide hints for the still open questions within the standard model . among these questions",
    "is the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking which in most practical theories provides masses to the particles .",
    "the traditional implementation of the symmetry breaking implies the existence of a new particle , the higgs boson , which so far has not been detected in high - energy collisions .    for the intermediate higgs boson mass , favoured by the results of indirect searches ,",
    "the most important production channel at a hadron collider is gluon fusion , @xmath0 , mediated by a top quark loop . during the last 20 years enormous efforts have been made to evaluate higher order corrections to this process .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) result has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and already almost 15 years ago also the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections became available  @xcite .",
    "more recently also the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections have been evaluated  @xcite . while the nlo results are exact in the top quark and higgs boson masses ( in this context , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the nnlo results rely on the effective theory built in the limit of the large top quark mass ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the three - loop corrections to the effective @xmath1 coupling ) .",
    "it is well known that this approximation works surprisingly well at nlo , leading to deviations from the exact result that are less than 2% for @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the aims of the present paper to investigate the validity of the large top quark mass approximation at nnlo .    during the last few years there appeared several improvements over the fixed - order calculation . among them",
    "is the soft - gluon resummation to next - to - next - to - leading  @xcite and next - to - next - to - next - to - leading  @xcite logarithmic orders and the identification ( and resummation ) of certain @xmath3 terms  @xcite which significantly improves the perturbative series .",
    "we furthermore want to mention ref .",
    "@xcite where the gluon - gluon channel has been considered in the limit of large center - of - mass energy @xmath4 .",
    "recent numerical predictions of higgs boson production in gluon fusion both at the tevatron and the lhc are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "very recently the effects of the finite top quark mass on the higgs boson production in hadron colliders have been reported in ref .",
    "the authors of that reference carried out an asymptotic expansion of the corresponding production diagrams and obtained results for the first four terms in the @xmath5 expansion , where the secondary expansion around the soft limit ( i.e. for @xmath6 ) has been performed to a sufficiently high order .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of an independent calculation of these finite top mass effects , confirming the conclusions of ref .",
    "similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , we apply asymptotic expansion in @xmath7 to the full qcd diagrams and evaluate a few first terms of the series .",
    "however , our results are not expanded near the soft limit and the @xmath8-dependence of the cross section ( which is valid below the top pair threshold , as discussed further ) is retained .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the cross sections in the individual channels of partonic reactions at nlo and nnlo .",
    "we consider in particular the behaviour near @xmath9 and describe a method to extrapolate our results to the limit of large @xmath10 . in section  [ sec::hadr ]",
    "we use the results of section  [ sec::part ] and numerically evaluate the hadronic cross section for the lhc and the tevatron .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec::concl ] .",
    "we introduce the following notation for the partonic cross section : @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting one of the possible initial states : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for ( different ) massless quark flavours . at nnlo the higgs boson in the final state may be accompanied by zero , one or two gluons , or by a light quark pair . in general , the quantities @xmath21 depend on @xmath8 and @xmath22 .",
    "leading order mass dependence is then described by the function @xmath23 given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "factoring out the exact lo top quark mass dependence as in eq .",
    "( [ eq::hatsigma ] ) is a common practice . in what follows , by the `` infinite top quark mass approximation ''",
    "we mean that only the quantities @xmath24 are evaluated for @xmath25 , but @xmath26 remains exact in @xmath27 .    at the lo",
    "only @xmath28 is different from zero and given by @xmath29    at the nlo the functions @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not zero , and at the nnlo one has to consider all five contributions : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    the first results on the @xmath22 dependence of nnlo cross sections appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , where the virtual part of @xmath33 was evaluated to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . in this paper",
    "we adhere to the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite ; in particular , we use @xmath40 and the on - shell top quark mass .",
    "since at the lo only the virtual contribution is present , we do not discuss it further . in order to evaluate the real corrections to @xmath24 ,",
    "we exploit the optical theorem and compute the imaginary part of the four - point amplitudes @xmath41 . at nlo and nnlo",
    "this requires the evaluation of three- and four - loop diagrams , respectively .",
    "some sample diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::diag ] .",
    "note that only the cuts dissecting the higgs boson propagator and one or two massless lines need to be included .",

    "dashed , curly and solid lines represent higgs bosons , gluons and top quarks , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we generate the diagrams with the help of qgraf  @xcite supplemented by additional scripts that eliminate the vanishing graphs . at the next step",
    "we apply the asymptotic expansion ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the limit @xmath42 , implemented in two independent programs : q2e / exp  @xcite , and an in - house perl implementation .",
    "this procedure factorizes the original triple - scale forward scattering functions into massive vacuum integrals ( with a single scale @xmath27 ) up to three loops , that can be evaluated with matad  @xcite , and four - point one- and two - loop integrals dependent on @xmath10 and @xmath43 . after the reduction performed with the laporta algorithm  @xcite",
    "we arrive to a set of master integrals that have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ( appendix  b ) .",
    "unfortunately , that reference contains a number of misprints .",
    "we independently evaluated these integrals by a combination of soft expansion and differential equation methods ( a detailed comparison to be provided elsewhere ) .    using these techniques",
    "we have been able to compute nnlo contributions through @xmath39 for the channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and through @xmath44 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the integral representation of the nlo corrections to the partonic cross section can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in analytic form the @xmath45 and @xmath46 terms ( @xmath14 channel ) were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite terms up to @xmath47 have been demonstrated .",
    "here it is convenient for us to include terms through @xmath38 given by @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we present the nnlo production cross section of the standard model higgs boson including finite top quark mass effects .",
    "our calculation is based on the evaluation of the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitudes which , via the optical theorem , directly leads to the total cross section .",
    "we apply the asymptotic expansion in order to obtain correction terms suppressed by the heavy top quark mass .",
    "we observe rapid convergence of the series below the threshold for the production of real top quarks , i.e. for @xmath51 .",
    "however , the region of small @xmath52 demonstrates @xmath53 singularities as a consequence of our expansion procedure . for the numerically dominant gluon - gluon channel",
    "we match our results to the large @xmath10 limit , curing thus those artificial singularities and obtaining stable predictions for the hadronic cross section .",
    "the numerical impact of the top quark mass suppressed terms is below approximately 1% and thus about a factor ten smaller than the uncertainty from scale variation .",
    "let us , however , stress that this result was not obvious a priori .",
    "our calculation justifies the use of the heavy top quark mass approximation when evaluating the nnlo cross section .",
    "we thank robert harlander and kemal ozeren for providing us with their analytical results and kirill melnikov for the useful communication .",
