    "some of the interesting cosmological and astrophysical situations are found in the state with high density , temperature and strong magnetic field .",
    "neutron star is a dense object which has a large chemical potential .",
    "recently it is observed that some of the neutron stars have extremely strong magnetic field.@xmath0 a primordial magnetic field in the early universe is also interesting.@xmath1 to understand the physics of such situation we consider the quantum field theory in an external magnetic field at finite chemical potential and temperature .",
    "one of the fundamental objects in the quantum field theory is a two - point green function .",
    "the exact form of the green function is necessary to deal with a strong magnetic field .",
    "much interest has been paid to obtain the green function under external fields .",
    "schwinger found the exact expression of the green function in an external magnetic field by using the proper - time formalism in 1951.@xmath2 the proper - time method is extended to deal with the thermal system in ref .",
    "trace of the green function corresponds to the vacuum self - energy of the free field .",
    "it is obtained by qed effective action and evaluated in a constant electromagnetic field at finite temperature@xmath3 and at finite chemical potential.@xmath4 variety of approaches are used to discuss the contributions from both the temperature and the chemical potential in refs .",
    "1013 .    in the present paper",
    "the proper - time formalism is re - considered in the imaginary time form of the thermal field theory .",
    "we modify the formalism to introduce both the temperature and the chemical potential exactly . in most of previous analysis",
    "the proper - time integral was analytically performed by the landau level expansion .",
    "since results are analytically continued to the wide range of parameters in the landau level approach , these results may contain some approximation for the combined effect of temperature , chemical potential and external magnetic field . to obtain physical results",
    "we carefully choose the contour of the proper - time integral.@xmath5 here the explicit form of the scalar and fermion green functions is written down in a proper - time form to discuss the physical contour in a constant magnetic field @xmath6 at finite temperature @xmath7 and chemical potential @xmath8 .",
    "as an example , we numerically calculate the vacuum self - energy for the free scalar and fermion fields and discuss the contour dependence of the proper - time integral .",
    "first we study the green function for a complex scalar field in the constant magnetic field , @xmath6 , at finite temperature , @xmath9 , and chemical potential , @xmath8 .",
    "the chemical potential is defined for the global u(1 ) symmetry of the complex field.@xmath10 in the constant magnetic field , the green function , @xmath11 , for the scalar field obeys the klein - gordon equation @xmath12 we introduce the temperature and the chemical potential to this equation . following the standard procedure of the imaginary time formalism,@xmath13 the thermal green function",
    "is defined in euclidean space - time by @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the time direction , @xmath16 , is restricted between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "thus the thermal theory has no lorentz invariance .",
    "it naturally follows that the thermal equilibrium is defined along a specific time direction .",
    "the klein - gordon equation is simplified by expanding the time direction , @xmath16 , in fourier series as @xmath20 where the matsubara frequency @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 for a scalar field .",
    "here we consider the constant magnetic field along the @xmath23-axis , @xmath24 , for simplicity . for the constant magnetic field the fourth component of @xmath25 vanishes , @xmath26 . for a constant @xmath25 eq.([green ] ) reduces to @xmath27 the induced green function , @xmath28 , has similar form to the three dimensional green function for the scalar field with mass @xmath29 in the electromagnetic field .",
    "@xmath30 develops an imaginary part only if both the temperature and the chemical potential have non - vanishing value .",
    "because of this imaginary part we must modify the original fock - schwinger method as is shown below .",
