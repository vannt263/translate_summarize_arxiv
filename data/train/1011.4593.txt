    "en una muestra de 476931 galaxias con lneas de emisin agostas del sloan digital sky survey data release 5 , identificamos y estudiamos galaxias de las cuales algunas importantes lneas de emisin usadas para determinar la naturaleza de su actividad ( [ oiii]@xmath05007 , h@xmath1 , o ambas ) no estn presentes .",
    "este fenmeno afecta al 22% de las galaxias con lneas de emisin y no esta relacionado con una baja razn de seal a ruido .",
    "en el diagrama comparando la largura equivalente ew([nii]@xmath06584 ) con la razn de lnea [ nii]@xmath06584/h@xmath2 , la mayoria de estas galaxias se clasifica como agn .",
    "el fwhm de la lnea h@xmath2 es del orden de 400 km s@xmath3 y la luminosidad mediana es 5.6@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 , lo cual justifica la clasificacin de estas galaxias como agn de baja luminosidad .",
    "un estudio en sus historias de formacin estelar usando starlight revela que no existe formacin estelar en el ltimo giga ao .",
    "las galaxias anfitrionas de las llagns son de tipo morfolgico temprano con bulbos ms masivos que los de agn luminosas .",
    "many galaxies show narrow emission lines in their spectra .",
    "we call them narrow emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) . following the seminal studies of baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1981 ) and veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) various spectroscopic diagnostic diagrams",
    "were devised to determine the nature of their ionization sources .",
    "the majority of nelgs traces a sequence in ionization consistent with ob stars , which categorizes them as star forming galaxies ( sfgs ) .",
    "a smaller fraction shows an excess of ionization that can not be explained by star forming activity .",
    "it is usually assumed that their source of ionization is non thermal .",
    "these galaxies are generally classified as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "galaxies falling in between sfgs and agns are then classified as transition type objects ( tos ) .    in a sample of 476931 nelgs from the sloan digital sky survey data release  5 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) we find three different cases of nelgs where the most important emission lines used in standard diagnostics diagrams are missing .",
    "we count 68491 galaxies without h@xmath1 , 27985 without [ oiii ] and 10926 without both lines .",
    "this represents 22% of the whole sample . discarding nelgs with s",
    "/ n@xmath7 ( s / n@xmath810 in the continuum ) leaves 224846 galaxies ( 47% of the original sample ) .",
    "we now count 34307 galaxies without h@xmath1 , 12455 without [ oiii ] , and 2840 without both lines , again amounting to 22% of the sample .",
    "this shows that the absence of emission lines is not a phenomenon related to low s / n .    using the spectral synthesis code starlight ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "2005 ) the fluxes and ew in h@xmath2 and [ nii]@xmath06584 were measured and compared to determine the activity type of the nelgs with emission lines missing ( coziol et al .",
    "we summarize our results in figure  [ fig:01 ] . the majority of nelgs with emission lines missing fall on the agn side of the diagram .",
    "this is particularly true for the galaxies without h@xmath1 .",
    "the median h@xmath2 luminosity ranges between @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 for the galaxies without [ oiii ] , and @xmath10 erg s@xmath3 for the galaxies without h@xmath1 .",
    "the low luminosity justifies the classification of these galaxies as low luminosity agns ( llagns ) .",
    "the nelgs with emission lines missing have broader line profiles than the sfgs .",
    "after correction for the resolution ( greene & ho 2006 ) , the fwhm of h@xmath2 fall between 25/75 percentiles 290 and 499 km s@xmath3",
    ". this is compared with 337 to 478 km s@xmath3 in luminous agns and 253 to 292 km s@xmath3 in sfgs .",
    "the gas producing the emission is moving at relatively higher speed in agns than in sfgs .    the morphology of the galaxies were determined based on photometric colors and inverse concentration index ( shimasaku et al . 2001 ) . while the galaxies without [ oiii ] are late - type spirals , t@xmath11 , the galaxies without h@xmath1 and with both lines missing are dominantly early - type galaxies , t@xmath12 . in general , the fraction of early type galaxies increases rapidly as the ew decreases .",
    "consistent with the morphology classification , the star formation histories as determined by starlight indicate that the nelgs without h@xmath1 and those with both lines missing show no evidence of star formation activity since @xmath13yrs .",
    "we compare the mass of the bulges as found in the three different samples of nelgs with emission lines missing in figure  [ fig:02 ] .",
    "the bulges in the galaxies without h@xmath1 and with both lines missing are generally more massive than in the luminous agns .    in their study of the activity of compact groups of galaxies coziol et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and martnez et al .",
    "( 2008 ; 2010 ) have found many examples of nelgs with emission lines missing , consistent with llagns .",
    "previous observations by phillips et al .",
    "( 1986 ) have also shown this phenomenon to be common in clusters of galaxies , affecting between 55% to 60% of all early - type galaxies .",
    "although we do not have a definite evidence yet , our preliminary analysis suggests that more than 50% ( 87% for the galaxies without both lines ) are in dense galactic environments .",
    "therefore , the llagns phenomenon may be related to a particular evolutionary phase of galaxies that formed in dense galactic environments .",
    "there is presently no consensus among researchers on what is the physical nature of agns with low luminosity .",
    "however , according to the standard interpretation , an agn is produced by the accretion of matter onto a massive black hole",
    ". therefore , one possibility to explain the llagns would be that the strong astration rates necessary to produce the massive bulges of galaxies in dense galactic environments have depleted the galaxies of most of their gas , affecting the accretion rates of their black holes ."
