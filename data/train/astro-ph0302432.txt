    "high redshift active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have gained renewed interest as cosmological probes with the findings that ( i ) there is a good correlation between the masses of the stellar bulges of galaxies and their central black holes suggesting a causal connection in their formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and ( ii ) that a population of high redshift heavily obscured agns seems the best candidate to account for a substantial fraction ( 30@xmath840% ) of the 5@xmath810 kev cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the detection of strong rest - frame uv absorption features show that there are hot young stars at @xmath11 in at least one case @xcite , and co mm - interferometry studies show that star formation occurs galaxy wide over scales of up to @xmath12 30kpc @xcite .",
    "these observations provide direct evidence that powerful hzrgs  are massive galaxies forming stars at rates as high as 2000@xmath13 . from the near - ir hubble @xmath14  diagram hzrgs",

    "of these latter sources , 3 ( or 9% of the entire sample ) did not show optical continuum emission down to a limit of @xmath19 and were detected only at near - ir ( @xmath3-band ) wavelengths .",
    "the nature of these `` no-@xmath1 '' objects is unclear . as discussed by de breuck et  al .",
    "one can think of the following possible explanations : objects which do show optical continuum ( i ) may be in the `` redshift desert '' ( @xmath20 ) where strong emission lines fall outside the observable window or ( ii ) may be pulsars ; objects without optical continuum ( iii ) may be highly obscured agns or ( iv ) be at such high redshift ( @xmath21 ) that ly@xmath6  is shifted out of the optical passband . in the latter two cases they may be young hzrgs  in an exceptionally vigorous stage of their formation , and one would expect large amounts of dust associated with them . to search for this",

    "many uss selected radio galaxies consist of multiple components @xcite .",

    ".    without a spectroscopic redshift we can use only indirect arguments to estimate the redshift of wn  j0305 + 3525  such as the @xmath14  diagram , the shape of the sed and the near - ir colors .",
    "we can not use the radio to sub - mm index as a redshift indicator @xcite as wn  j0305 + 3525  is radio loud .",
    "the @xmath14  diagram as determined for hzrgs  ( db02 ) seems to hold also for the sub - mm population @xcite .",
    "if we take a total magnitude of @xmath64 to be representative for wn",
    "j0305 + 3525(table [ table ] ) , then we estimate from the @xmath14  diagram that wn  j0305 + 3525is at @xmath65 .    comparing the ( sub)-mm ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 with redshifted models of dusty starforming galaxies ( c.f .",
    "fig . 3 in * ?",
    "* ) results in redshift estimates of @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively",
    ". moreover , almost all uss radio galaxies that are detected in the sub - mm are at redshifts @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ 0305sed ] represents the observed sed of wn  j0305 + 3525  and shows that the ( sub-)mm emission is of thermal origin and effectively rules out that the object is a pulsar .",
    "a starburst sed with @xmath71 would fit the data closely at both the near - ir and ( sub-)mm points .",
    "the colors of the @xmath3-band objects are too uncertain to usefully constrain the redshifts using stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "the possible detection of faint continuum redward of @xmath72  in object 3 is consistent with the object being at high redshift : it could be featureless continuum redward of a ly@xmath6  forest region at @xmath73 .",
    "if wn  j0305 + 3525  is indeed at @xmath75 then its restframe fir properties are @xmath76  @xmath77 , implying @xmath78  @xmath79 and star formation rate @xmath80 for standard dust models and cosmology ( c.f .",
    "4c  60.07 ; @xmath81 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is comparable to the radio-``quiet '' sub - mm source lockman  850.1 which has been estimated to be at @xmath82 , based on its sub - mm / mm sed @xcite , as well as other , radio-``loud '' galaxies in this redshift range .",
    "compared with traditional hzrgs , the ly@xmath6emission ( @xmath83 ) is relatively weak given its radio power ( @xmath84 ) , but still within the large observed scatter ( c.f . fig . 10 in * ? ? ?",
    "thus wn  j0305 + 3525  appears to be a heavily obscured radio - loud luminous sub - mm source .",
    "we consider two options that could explain the strong obscuration .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that dust particles in high redshift galaxies may be predominantly smaller than in local starbursting systems .",
    "the argument is based on a different origin of the dust : at high redshifts there has been little time for m giants ( the primary sources of local dust ) to appear , and most early dust would be produced by m supergiants and supernovae instead .",
    "the increase of the sub - mm detection rate with redshift for radio galaxies ( reuland et  al .  in prep .",
    "* ) might then be interpreted as being due to changing dust properties with redshift .",
    "smaller dust particles lower the estimated dust masses and star formation rates and , because they are more efficient uv absorbers , this might explain why some of the most massive starforming galaxies are not seen in the optical at all .",
    "another reason that wn  j0305 + 3525  is heavily dust enshrouded might be related to its young evolutionary stage .",
    "this is supported by the compactness of the associated radio source for wn  j0305 + 3525  and the other `` no-@xmath1 '' hzrg - candidates .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that , on average , compact sources are younger than more extended ones @xcite",
    ". the dense circumnuclear dust configuration would then quench the ly@xmath6  emission .",
    "this suggests a scenario in which massive radio galaxies form with a large starburst , perhaps simultaneously in several smaller , merging components .",
    "this starburst manifests itself as a luminous `` sub - mm source '' . during the next stage",
    "a massive black hole is formed and/or activated , but any rest - frame optical emission remains obscured by dust from the starburst . as the radio source evolves it grows and expels the obscuring dust envelope , becoming visible as a hzrg(c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is essentially the radio - loud version of scenarios where `` ultra luminous infrared galaxies '' evolve into quasars as envisaged by @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies are the most massive and most extended galaxy sized systems that are known to exist at high redshift .",
    "they are therefore good targets for studying the origin of the relationship between galaxies and their central black holes .",
    "wn  j0305 + 3525  may be at the stage where both the galaxy and the black hole are being put together . as with other sub - mm sources",
    "it is difficult to obtain spectroscopic redshifts and it is important to obtain further information about their seds at mid- and far - ir wavelengths .",
    "x - ray imaging could show whether or not there is a bright agn associated with wn  j0305 + 3525 .",
