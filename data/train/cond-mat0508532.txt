    "finite spin densities in semiconductors have traditionally @xcite been generated by external magnetic fields , by circularly polarized light sources , or by spin injection from ferromagnets .",
    "recently there has been considerable interest @xcite in an alternate strategy in which edge spin densities are generated electrically via the spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite , i.e. , in a planar device by the current of spins oriented perpendicular to the plane that is generated by and flows perpendicular to an electric field .",

    "the theoretical works @xcite and the subsequent experimental discovery @xcite of the she in both strong and weak so interaction regimes have generated substantial interest in both the origins of this unfamiliar transport phenomenon and its potential for low power consumption electronic devices @xcite .",
    "the role of disorder in the spin - hall conductivity is more subtle than in more familiar transport coefficients .",
    "early theoretical work reflected a variety of strongly polarized views , all the way from a picture with large dissipationless transverse spin currents @xcite in which disorder plays no role , to demonstrations that the effect is completely eliminated by infinitesimally weak disorder @xcite .",
    "the theoretical picture is now becoming more clear , if more complex .",
    "it is now established that many of the theoretical controversies have arisen because what is seemingly the simplest possible model system , a two - dimensional electron gas with rashba so coupling @xcite , turns out to have anomalous properties .",
    "although the she is absent in this model , it is present and robust against disorder @xcite in generic systems and in all other models that have been specifically studied .",
    "another challenging issue in she theory concerns the definition of the spin current in so coupled systems ; since spin is not conserved the merit of a particular definition has to be decided on the basis of its utility for the evaluation of observable properties .",
    "the fact that different definitions have been proposed which yield spin hall currents that differ even by a sign for some models emphasizes the importance of this point @xcite .",
    "the most important observable associated with the she is the edge spin accumulations to which it gives rise ; indeed experiments that discovered the she @xcite did so by measuring edge spin accumulations .",
    "these measurements have partly steered the focus of theoretical studies from the experimentally ambiguous spin hall currents to spin hall accumulations @xcite .",
    "the opportunity to directly compare theoretical and experimental values of a she related physical quantity has been appealing , yet physicists have entered this territory armed with no analytical theory that is able to predict the sign , magnitude , and spatial extent of the she spin accumulation , at least in the most interesting case of strong so interactions . particularly intriguing in this context is the dual role of so coupling which generates the spin - polarization of carriers while , at the same time , causing spin decoherence upon scattering off channel edges or off impurities . in the present paper",
