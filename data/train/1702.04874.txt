    "since the linear - chain configuration of 3@xmath3 clusters ( linearly aligned 3@xmath3 clusters ) was suggested in 1950 s @xcite , many studies have been devoted to search it in the excited states of @xmath7c @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , no positive evidence has been obtained , and it is considered that the linear - chain is unstable against the bending motion @xcite .    instead of @xmath7c ,",
    "neutron - rich c isotopes have attracted much interest in these decades as new candidates of the linear - chain , because it is expected that the valence neutrons will play a glue - like role and stabilize the linear - chain against the bending motion @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies predict the rotational bands with the linear - chain configurations in c isotopes @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the motion of the valence neutron can be qualitatively interpreted in terms of the molecular orbits analogous to the be isotopes @xcite , which are called @xmath1- and @xmath2-orbits .",
    "concurrently , rather promising candidates of the linear - chain were reported in @xmath0c and @xmath8c by several experiments @xcite .    in our previous study @xcite ,",
    "based on the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculation , we pointed out that two positive - parity rotational bands in @xmath0c have the linear - chain configurations .",
    "the first band which we call @xmath1-bond linear chain has two valence neutrons in @xmath1-orbit and is built on the @xmath9 state at 14.6 mev which is just above the @xmath5 threshold but below the @xmath10 threshold .",
    "it was found that the energies and widths of the resonances observed by the @xmath5 elastic scattering @xcite qualitatively agree with the theoretical calculations @xcite including ours .",
    "therefore , they are regarded as the @xmath1-bond linear - chain candidates , although the experimental spin - parity assignment was somewhat ambiguous . the other band",
    "named @xmath2-bond linear chain has valence neutrons in @xmath2-orbit and built on the @xmath9 state above the @xmath5 and @xmath11 thresholds .",
    "it has more elongated linear - chain configuration and larger moment of inertia than the former band , but the experimental counterpart was not known at that time .",
    "quite recently , very interesting data were reported by two groups .",
    "@xcite reported the result of the @xmath5 elastic scattering and updated the information about the candidates of the @xmath1-bond linear chain .",
    "the reported resonances look essentially same with those found in previous experiments @xcite .",
    "however , owing to the better statistics and larger angular coverage , they provided more reliable spin - parity assignment and evaluation of the decay widths .",
    "the other experiment was reported by tian _",
    "_ @xcite and li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who observed the resonances populated by @xmath12 reaction .",
    "in addition to the same resonances reported by yamaguchi _",
    "et al . _ , they found new resonances located _ above _ the @xmath5 and @xmath11 thresholds .",
    "based on the observed energies and decay pattern , these new resonances were suggested as the candidates of the @xmath2-bond linear chain .    these new data motivated us to perform additional analysis and to summarize the calculated and observed properties of the linear - chain bands in @xmath0c .",
    "we investigated several decay modes of the linear - chain bands whose wave functions are obtained in our previous work @xcite . by the comparison with the new data , it is found that the agreement between the calculated and observed @xmath1-bond linear - chain band is plausible .",
    "it is also shown that the observed unique decay pattern of the resonances reported by tian _",
    "_ agrees with the @xmath2-bond linear - chain band , which is the first evidence for the existence of two different linear - chain bands with @xmath1- and @xmath2-bonding .",
    "in addition to these analysis , it was found that the @xmath2-bond linear chain decays to the @xmath13 channel as well as the @xmath5 channel , and their branching ratios are comparable . hence , we suggest that the sequential three - body decay of @xmath14 is an important evidence of the @xmath2-bond linear chain .    the paper is organized as follows . the amd framework and the method to estimate the reduced widths amplitude for the @xmath5 and @xmath13 decays are explained in the next section . in sec .",
    "iii , the excitation energies and decay widths of the linear - chain states are shown and compared with the observed data to suggest the assignment of the linear - chain bands . in the last section , we summarize this work .",

    "the color plots show the single particle orbits occupied by the most weakly bound neutron . ]    generally , the partial decay width should be independent on the choice of the channel radius .",
    "however , in the practical calculation , the channel radius must be properly chosen to stabilize the results because of the following two problems .",
    "firstly , the channel radius should not be too large value , because we adopt the bound - state approximation in the gcm calculation and hence the wave function is not correct at large inter - cluster distance .",
    "secondly , the channel radius @xmath63 should not be too small , because the antisymmetrization effect can not be neglected and the approximation is not valid .",
    "therefore , we adopted two different values for the channel radius .",
    "the first choice is @xmath98 fm which is common to the value used in the",
    "_ r_-matrix analysis of the @xmath1-bond linear chain candidates observed in ref.@xcite and close to that in ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this choice of channel radius was found inappropriate for the analysis of the @xmath2-bond linear chain . because @xmath2-bond linear chain is dominated by the @xmath99 channels and @xmath100 have larger radii than the ground state",
    ", the larger channel radius should be used to avoid the antisymmerzation effect .",
    "hence , we used @xmath101 fm for the analysis of @xmath2-bond linear chain .      here , we explain how the wave functions of @xmath88he and @xmath89he clusters are constructed .",
    "the wave function of @xmath88he is approximated by a @xmath102 wave function of harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) which is represented by the gaussian wave packet with the width of @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath103 the ground state of @xmath89he is approximated by a @xmath104 configuration as @xmath105^{j=0}\\ } \\label{eq : he6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is also the eigen function of h.o . in the practical calculation , we do not use h.o .",

    "figure [ fig : spectrum+ ] summarizes the calculated rotational bands with the linear - chain configurations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and experimental data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-bond linear - chain band shown by blue squares is built on the @xmath9 state at 14.6 mev which lies just above the @xmath119 threshold but below @xmath120 and @xmath121 thresholds .",
    "the other band , the @xmath2-bond linear - chain , is built on the @xmath9 state at 22.2 mev which is above all of those thresholds .",
    "theoretically , the assignment of these two bands is rather unique .",
    "the reason of the assignment and the properties of the linear - chain bands are as follows .",
    "firstly , these bands are dominated by the intrinsic states having the linear - chain configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] .",
    "the @xmath1-bond linear chain has large overlap with the intrinsic wave function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](a ) which amounts to 87% for the @xmath9 state at 14.6 mev .",
    "the proton density distribution shown by solid lines clearly indicates the formation of the linearly aligned three alpha clusters surrounded by the two valence neutrons shown by the color plot .",
    "as already discussed in refs.@xcite , in terms of the molecular orbit picture , this valence neutron orbit is interpreted as the @xmath1-orbit which is composed of the perpendicular alignment of the _ p_-wave around the alpha cluster as illustrated in fig.[fig : illust_mol](a ) .",
    "the @xmath2-bond linear - chain is dominated by the intrinsic wave function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](b ) whose overlap with the @xmath9 state at 22.2 mev amounts to 99% .",
    "again , we recognize the formation of the 3@xmath3 linear chain , but the valence neutron orbit is different .",
    "it is interpreted as the @xmath2-orbit shown in fig.[fig : illust_mol](b ) which is composed of the parallel alignment of the _ p_-orbits . since all other states in this energy region denoted by lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum+ ] have much less overlap with the configurations , the linear - chain bands can be clearly assigned .",
    "secondly , the b(e2 ) transition strengths between the member states of these bands are rather strong compared to other in - band and inter - band transitions as listed in table.iii in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is consistent with the dominance of the strongly deformed intrinsic shapes with linear - chain configuration . because the @xmath2-bond linear chain is more strongly deformed than the @xmath1-bond linear chain , its in - band transition strengths are stronger than those of @xmath1-bond linear chain .",
    "deference of the deformation also reflected to the moment - of - inertia ; @xmath122179 and 98 kev for @xmath1-bond and @xmath2-bond linear - chain bands , respectively .    finally , among the excited states located around the @xmath119 , @xmath123 and @xmath121 thresholds , the linear - chain bands have largest @xmath3 and @xmath124 reduced widths .",
    "therefore , the alpha decaying resonances in the vicinity of these thresholds are , if observed , regarded as the candidates of the linear - chain bands .",
    "now , we discuss the assignment of the linear - chain bands based on the latest experimental data .",
    "@xcite , fritsch _ et al . _ @xcite and more recently , yamaguchi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite independently reported the resonances observed in the @xmath5 scattering , which are shown by circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum+ ] and summarized in table .",
    "[ table : lc ] .",
    "_ reported the @xmath125 and @xmath126 resonances at 18.22 and 20.80 mev , respectively , while fritsch _",
    "_ reported the @xmath127 and @xmath125 resonances at 15.0 and 19.0 mev .",
    "a candidate of the @xmath127 resonance at 17.95 mev was also reported by freer _",
    "_ , but not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum+ ] because the spin - parity assignment is not so firm .",
    "_ reported the @xmath9 , @xmath127 and @xmath125 resonances at 15.07 , 16.22 and 18.87 mev .",
    "the @xmath125 energy is very close to that observed by fritsch _",
    "et al . _ and the @xmath9 state may correspond to the fritsch _",
    "s 15.0 mev state which was assigned as @xmath127 .",
    "although they suggest different spin - parity assignments , we consider that they observed essentially the same resonances which are assigned to the @xmath1-bond linear - chain band from the following reasons .",
    "firstly , it is clear that these resonance energies very nicely agree with those of the calculated @xmath1-bond linear - chain , regardless of the spin - parity assignments .",
    "furthermore , the observed data show the large moment - of - inertia of the band ; @xmath122 116 kev @xcite and 190 kev @xcite . in any cases , the very large moment - of - inertia are consistent with the large deformation of the linear - chain band which reaches to 3:1 ratio of the deformation axes . in particular , the moment - of - inertia reported by yamaguchi _",
    "( @xmath122190 kev ) is very close to the present result .",
    "since their experiments have better statistics and larger angular coverage than others , we expect that their spin - parity assignments are reliable .",
    "we also note that the 15.0 mev state observed by fritsch _",
    "_ can be assigned as @xmath9 instead of @xmath127 , because this state is very close to the @xmath9 state at 15.07 mev reported by yamaguchi _",
    "et al . _ with this change of the assignment ,",
    "the moment - of - inertia of fritsch _ et al .",
    "_ s experiment is close to the yamaguchi",
    "_ et al . _",
    "s data and consistent with the present theoretical result .    secondly , as listed in table .",
    "[ table : lc ] , the observed resonances have large alpha decay widths to the @xmath119 channel comparable with those of the @xmath1-bond linear - chain .",
    "experimental data are not quantitatively consistent to each other , but most of them are few hundreds kev which are the same order of magnitude with the calculated @xmath1-bond linear - chain .",
    "this is rather strong evidence of the linear - chain formation , because theories predict no other states than the @xmath1-bond linear - chain states which have large alpha decay widths in this energy region .",
    "it must be noted that the @xmath2-bond linear - chain band has rather small decay widths to he @xmath119 channel , which distinguishes the @xmath2-bond linear - chain from the @xmath1-bond linear - chain .",
    "the reason for this decay suppression will be explained in the next section .",
    "finally , theories predicted the decay of the @xmath1-bond linear - chain to the @xmath128 channel despite of the smaller decay _ q_-value ( table.[table : lc2 ] ) .",
    "this is because of the strong admixture of the @xmath119 and @xmath128 configurations in the @xmath1-bond linear - chain , which originates in the strong coupling nature of the linearly aligned alpha clusters .",
    "experimentally , the width of the @xmath128 decay has not been measured , but fritsch _ et al .",
    "_ reported the decay of the @xmath125 resonance to the @xmath128 channel .",
    "thus , the excitation energies , moment - of - inertia and the decay widths are consistent between the theory and the @xmath5 scattering experiment , and hence , the formation of @xmath1-bond linear - chain in @xmath0c looks rather plausible .",
    "we also note that the same resonances were also observed in the break up @xcite and transfer reactions @xcite , although the spin - parity assignment was not given .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we focus on the linear - chain states of @xmath0c based on the amd calculations to establish the existence of the linear - chain configuration .",
    "the linear - chain configurations generate two rotational bands . at strong deformed prolate region ,",
    "two different linear - chain configurations with valence neutrons in @xmath1-orbit and @xmath2-orbit were obtained .",
    "the @xmath1-bond linear chain generates a rotational band around the @xmath3 threshold energy .",
    "the energies and @xmath3 decay widths of the @xmath1-bond linear chain are in reasonable agreement with the resonances observed by the @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the @xmath1-bond linear - chain formation in @xmath129 looks plausible .    on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2-bond linear - chain generates a rotational band around the @xmath50 threshold energy which is 7.5 mev higher than the @xmath3 threshold energy .",
    "newly observed resonance states are close to energies of both the low - spin states of the @xmath2-bond linear - chain and the @xmath126 state of the @xmath1-bond linear - chain . in order to distinguish the @xmath1- and @xmath2-bond linear - chain , we focus on the decay patterns of them . reduced widths",
    "show that the @xmath1-bond linear - chain states decay into the ground band of @xmath4 , while the @xmath2-bond linear - chain states decay into the excited band of @xmath4 .",
    "this difference is due to the molecular - orbit of @xmath4 .    from @xmath124",
    "reduced width , in addition , it is found that the @xmath2-bond linear - chain states decay into not only the excited band of @xmath4 but also @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , the calculation predicts that the linear - chain will also decay to the @xmath131 as well as to the ground state of @xmath132 .",

    "<S> the decay properties of the linear - chain states in @xmath0c are investigated by using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation predicts two rotational bands with linear - chain configurations having the @xmath1-bond and @xmath2-bond valence neutrons . for the @xmath1-bond linear - chain </S>",
    "<S> , the calculated excitation energies and the widths of @xmath3-decay to the ground state of @xmath4 reasonably agree with the experimental candidates observed by the @xmath5 resonant scattering . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-bond linear - chain is the candidate of the higher - lying resonant states reported by the break - up reaction . as the evidence of the @xmath2-bond linear - chain , we discuss its decay pattern . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the @xmath2-bond linear - chain not only decays to the excited band of @xmath4 but also decays to the three - body channel of @xmath6 , and the branching ratio of these decays are comparable . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we suggest that this characteristic decay pattern is a strong signature of the linear - chain formation and a key observable to distinguish two different linear - chains . </S>"
