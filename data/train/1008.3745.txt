    "for a long time , we believed that landau symmetry - breaking theory@xcite describes all possible orders in materials , and all possible ( continuous ) phase transitions .",
    "however , in last twenty years , it has become more and more clear that landau symmetry - breaking theory does not describe all possible orders . for example , different fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states@xcite all have the same symmetry .",
    "thus it is impossible to use symmetry breaking to characterize different fqh states .",
    "if landau symmetry breaking theory is not enough , then what should we use to describe those new states of matter ?",
    "it turns out that we need to develop a totally new theory , to described the new types of orders ",
    "topological / quantum order@xcite  that appear in the fqh states and the spin liquid states .    in , a systematic understanding of a large class of topological orders in strongly correlated bosonic systems without symmetry has been developed based on string - net condensations . in , the string - net classification of topological orders was generalized , based on local unitary ( lu ) transformations . in , topological orders with symmetry are studied using projective symmetry group and tensor network renormalization .",
    "but so far , we still do not have a complete classification of topological orders for interacting systems .",
    "recently , for non - interacting gapped fermion systems with certain symmetries , a complete classification of topological phases has been developed based on the k - theory.@xcite a generalization of the free fermion result to interacting cases has been obtained for 1d systems.@xcite    for 1d bosonic systems , studied quantized berry phases for spin rotation symmetric systems . studied the entanglement spectrum and the symmetry properties of matrix product states . using those tools",
    ", they obtained some interesting results which are special cases of the situation considered here .",
    "in this paper , we will apply the approach used in to 1d strongly correlated systems .",
    "we will combine the local unitary transformation with the symmetry properties of matrix product states , and try to obtain a complete classification of all gapped phases in 1d quantum spin systems with certain simple symmetries .",
    "we find that    1 .",

    "_ for 1d non - translation invariant ( nti ) spin systems with only an on - site symmetry described by a group @xmath0 , all the phases of gapped systems that do not break the symmetry are classified by the equivalence classes in the second cohomology group @xmath1 of the group @xmath0 , provided that the physical states on each site form a linear representation of the group @xmath0 . _    ( note that the equivalence classes in @xmath1 classify the types of projective representations of @xmath0 over the field @xmath2 of complex numbers .",
    "appendix [ prorep ] gives a brief introduction on projective representation and the second cohomology group . ) in certain cases where @xmath0 has infinitely many 1d representations , for example when @xmath3 , further classification according to different 1d representations exist .",
    "but quantum states are defined only up to global change of phases , therefore the symmetry operations of group @xmath0 only needs to be represented by operators @xmath4 which satisfy @xmath5 for any group element @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "such operators form a projective representation of group @xmath0 .",
    "when we consider this general case , we find that the classification result remains the same as with linear representations , that is ,    1 .   _ for 1d non - translation invariant ( nti ) spin systems with only an on - site symmetry described by a group @xmath0 , all the phases of gapped systems that do not break the symmetry are classified by the equivalence classes in the second cohomology group @xmath1 of the group @xmath0 , provided that the physical states on each site form a projective representation of the group @xmath0 .",
    "_    in certain cases where @xmath0 has infinitely many 1d representations , further classification according to different 1d representations exist .",
    "applying these general results to specific cases allows us to reach the following conclusions : first , result ( a ) means that there is no non - trivial topological order in 1d systems without any symmetry ; using result ( b ) , we find that nti integer - spin chain with only on - site @xmath8 spin rotation symmetry can have two and only two different phases that do not break the @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "result ( c ) implies that nti half - integer - spin chain with only on - site @xmath8 spin rotation symmetry ( which is represented projectively ) also have two and only two gapped phase that does not break the @xmath8 symmetry ; we note the cyclic @xmath9 group has no non - trivial projective representations , thus nti spin chain with only on - site @xmath9 symmetry can have one and only one gapped phase that does not break the @xmath9 symmetry ; the @xmath10 symmetry group has no non - trivial projective representation either , however , due to the special structure of the group of 1d representations of @xmath10 , nti spin chain with only on - site @xmath10 symmetry can have three and only three gapped phase that does not break the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "we also considered systems with translation invariance ( ti ) and correspondingly many results have been obtained .    1 .   _",

    "( this has been discussed as the generic case in ) .",
    "2 .   _ for 1d spin systems with only translation symmetry and an on - site symmetry described by a group @xmath0 , all the phases of gapped systems that do not break the two symmetries are labeled by the equivalence classes in the second cohomology group @xmath1 of the group @xmath0 and different 1d representations @xmath11 of @xmath0 , provided that the physical states on each site form a linear representation of the group @xmath0 .",

    "_    in particular , we can show that the @xmath8 spin rotation symmetric integer spin chain has two different gapped ti phases:@xcite the spin-0 trivial phase and the haldane phase@xcite , while translation invariant @xmath8 symmetric half - integer spin chain must either be gapless or have degeneracy in ground space due to broken discrete symmetries@xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath12 symmetric spin chains where on - site degrees of freedom contain both integer - spin and half - integer - spin representations have only one gapped ti phase .",
    "we also show that the spin chain with only translation and parity symmetry ( defined as exchange of sites together with an on - site @xmath13 operation ) has four different gapped ti phases.@xcite    for systems with time reversal symmetry , we find that nti time reversal symmetric systems belong to two phases while ti time reversal symmetric phases on integer spin systems have two phases and those on half - integer spin systems are either gapless or have degeneracy in ground space .    the paper is organized as follows : section [ qphase ] gives a detailed definition of gapped quantum phases and explains how that gives rise to an equivalence relation between gapped ground states within the same phase ; section [ 1dgapmps ] shows that short - range correlated matrix product states represents faithfully 1d gapped ground states and hence will be our object of study ; section [ notop ] discusses the situation where no symmetry is required and found no topological order in 1d ; section [ symtop ] gives the classification of phases for 1d systems with certain symmetries , for example on - site symmetry and time reversal symmetry .",
    "it classifies phases in translational invariant systems , and furthermore in systems where translational invariance is present together with other symmetries such as on - site symmetry , parity symmetry and time reversal symmetry ; section [ highd ] generalizes some simple 1d results to higher dimensions ; finally in section [ conc ] we summarize our results and conclude this paper .",
    "to obtain the above stated results , we need to first briefly discuss the definition of quantum phases .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in .",
    "quantum phase describes an equivalence relation between quantum systems .",
    "systems we consider live on a @xmath14-dimensional lattice and interactions are local ( with finite range ) . a gapped quantum phase is usually defined as a class of gapped hamiltonians which can smoothly deform into each other without closing gap and hence without any singularity in the local properties of ground state .",
    "such an equivalence relation between hamiltonians can be reinterpreted as an equivalence relation between ground states , as discussed in : _ two gapped ground states belong to the same phase if and only if they are related by a local unitary ( lu ) transformation_. to @xmath15 might not map the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath16 to @xmath17 , but instead to some @xmath18 . however , as @xmath17 and @xmath18 are both gapped and have the same ground states , their equivalence is obvious . ] as lu transformations can change local entanglement structure but not the global one , states in the same phase have the same long range entanglement ( lre ) and hence the same topological order.@xcite states equivalent to product states have only short range entanglement ( sre ) and hence trivial topological order .",
    "all the states with short range entanglement belong to the same phase while states with long range entanglement can belong to the different phases .",
    "these considerations lead to the phase diagram as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](a ) , for the class of systems without any symmetry requirement .",
    "a lu transformation @xmath19 can either take the form of finite time evolution with a local hamiltonian @xmath20 \\label{lu_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes time ordered integral and @xmath22 is a sum of local hermitian terms . or @xmath19 can take the form of a constant depth quantum circuit @xmath23 which is composed of @xmath24 layers of unitaries and the @xmath25 s within each layer @xmath26 are local and commute with each other.@xcite these two forms of lu transformations are equivalent to each other and we will mainly take the quantum circuit form for the discussion in this paper ( the time evolution form is used for discussion of translation invariant systems ) .",
    "more generally , we will consider equivalence relation between states defined on different hilbert spaces and hence we allow a broader notion of unitarity ( which is called generalized lu transformation in and corresponds to the disentanglers and isometries in mera@xcite ) .",
    "each lu operation @xmath25 we consider in the quantum circuit will act unitarily on the support space of the reduced density matrix of the region with @xmath27 of the original hilbert space and @xmath28 of the support space of reduced density matrix .",
    "while the total hilbert space might change under such an operation , the entanglement structure of the state remains intact and hence the state remains in the same phase with the same topological order .",
    "if the class of systems under consideration have further symmetry constraints , two hamiltonians are in the same phase if they can be connected by a smooth path that stays within this symmetric region .",
    "correspondingly , the equivalence relation between gapped ground states of the same phase needs to be modified : @xcite _ if the class of systems have certain symmetry , two gapped ground states belong to the same phase if and only if they are related by a lu transformation which does not break the symmetry .",
    "_ such an restricted equivalence relation leads to a phase diagram with more structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](b ) .",
    "first not all short range entangled states belong to the same phase .",
    "short range entangled states with different symmetry breaking will belong to different phases .",
    "those symmetry breaking phases with short range entanglement ( sb - sre ) are well described by landau s symmetry breaking theory @xcite .",
    "can all phases with short range entanglement be described by symmetry breaking ?",
    "landau s symmetry breaking theory suggest that states with the same symmetry always belong to the same phase , which implies that all phases with short range entanglement are described by symmetry breaking . however , this result turns out to be not quite correct .",
    "states which do not break any symmetry can still belong to different phases as well.@xcite we will refer to the order in symmetric short range entanglement ( sy - sre ) states as _ _ symmetry protected topological order__@xcite . for example , in the presence of parity symmetry , the haldane phase and the @xmath29 phase of spin-1 chain belong to two different phases even though both phases have short range entanglement and do not break the parity symmetry . also , in the presence of time - reversal symmetry , the topological insulators and the band insulators belong to two different phases .",
    "again both phases have short range entanglement .    for systems with long range entanglement , the phase diagram similarly divides into symmetry breaking ( sb - lre ) and symmetric ( sy - lre ) phases .",
    "the charge @xmath30 superconducting states@xcite and the symmetric @xmath31 states@xciteare examples of the sb - lre phases and the sy - lre phases respectively .     without any symmetry restriction .",
    "( b ) the possible phases for class of hamiltonians @xmath32 with some symmetries . the shaded regions in ( a ) and ( b ) represent the phases with short range entanglement . ]",
    "having defined the universality classes of phases as the equivalence classes of states under ( symmetric ) local unitary transformations , we would then like to know which phases exist , or in other words , to classify all possible phases in strongly correlated systems .",
    "some partial classifications have been discussed for strongly correlated systems through string - net states,@xcite and for free fermion systems with certain symmetries through k - theory.@xcite in this paper , we would like to consider 1d gapped strongly correlated spin systems both with and without symmetry , and try to classify all such systems whose ground state does not break any symmetry .",
    "( in other words , the ground state has the same symmetry as the hamiltonian . )",
    "completely classifying strongly correlated spin systems seems to be a hard task as in general strongly interacting quantum many - body systems are very hard to solve .",
    "however , the recent insight about describing 1d gapped ground states of spin systems with matrix product state formalism@xcite provides us with a handle to deal with this problem .",
    "a matrix product states ( mps ) is expressed as @xmath33}_{i_1}a^{[2]}_{i_2} ...",
    "a^{[n]}_{i_n})|i_1i_2 ... i_n\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the physical dimension of a spin at each site , @xmath36}_{i_k}$ ] s are @xmath37 matrices on site @xmath26 with @xmath38 being the inner dimension of the mps .",
    "it has been shown that matrix product states capture the essential features of 1d gapped ground state , for example an entanglement area law@xcite and finite correlation length@xcite , and provide an efficient description of such states@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , generic matrix product states satisfying a condition called ` injectivity ' are all gapped ground states of local hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "therefore , studying this class of mps will enable us to give a full classification of 1d gapped spin systems .",
    "now the question of what phases exist in 1d gapped spin systems can be restated as what equivalence classes of matrix product states exist under lu transformations",
    ". gave a specific way to apply such lu transformations , which realizes a renormalization group transformation on mps that removes local entanglement and takes the states to a simple fixed point form .",
    "a partial classification of mps is also given in . in the following",
    "we will use this procedure to classify gapped phases of 1d spin system , in particular the 1d systems with various symmetries .",
    "we see that the possible phases in 1d strongly correlated systems depend on the symmetry of the class of systems .",
    "first we will briefly review how the renormalization group transformation @xcite is done . for the identification and optimal removal of local entanglement ,",
    "a particularly useful mathematical construction is the double tensor @xmath39}_{\\alpha\\gamma,\\beta\\chi}=\\sum_{i } a^{[k]}_{i,\\alpha\\beta } \\times ( a^{[k]}_{i,\\gamma\\chi})^*$ ] of the mps .",
    "@xmath39}$ ] uniquely determines the state up to a local change of basis on each site@xcite , that is , if @xmath40}_{\\alpha\\gamma,\\beta\\chi}=\\sum_{i } a^{[k]}_{i,\\alpha\\beta } \\times ( a^{[k]}_{i,\\gamma\\chi})^ * = \\sum_{i } b^{[k]}_{i,\\alpha\\beta } \\times ( b^{[k]}_{i,\\gamma\\chi})^*\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then @xmath36}_{i,\\alpha\\beta}$ ] and @xmath41}_{i,\\alpha\\beta}$ ] are related by a unitary transformation @xmath42}$ ] : @xmath43}_{i,\\alpha\\beta}= \\sum_j u^{[k]}_{ij } a^{[k]}_{j,\\alpha\\beta } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , states described by @xmath36}_i$ ] and @xmath41}_i$ ] have exactly the same entanglement structure , which is faithfully captured in @xmath39}$ ] .",
    "a proof of this fact can be found in . for clarity , we present the proof in appendix [ dbt ] following the notation of this paper .",
    "local unitary operations on mps can be applied through manipulation of @xmath39}$ ] . treat @xmath39}$ ] as a @xmath44 matrix with row index @xmath45 and column index @xmath46 . to apply a unitary operation on @xmath14 consecutive sites ,",
    "we combine the double tensor of the @xmath14 sites together into @xmath47 } \\mathbb{e}^{[2 ] } ...",
    "\\mathbb{e}^{[n]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then decompose @xmath48 into a set of matrices @xmath49",
    "s @xmath50 note @xmath51 is determined up to a unitary transformation on @xmath52 .",
    "the index @xmath52 of @xmath53 , up to an unitary transformation , can be viewed as the combination of @xmath54 , the indices of @xmath55}_{i_1,\\alpha\\beta}$ ] , @xmath56}_{i_2,\\alpha\\beta}$ ] , ...",
    "@xmath57}_{i_n,\\alpha\\beta}$ ] .",
    "going from original indices @xmath54 to the effective index @xmath52 corresponds to applying a unitary operation on the @xmath14-block and @xmath49 describes the new state after operation .",
    "the unitary operation can be chosen so that local entanglement is maximally removed .",
    "@xmath48 contains all the information about the entanglement of the block with the rest of the system but not any detail of entanglement structure within the block .",
    "hence we can determine from @xmath48 the optimal way of decomposition into @xmath58 which corresponds to the unitary operation that maximally removes local entanglement while preserving the global structure .",
    "to do so , think of @xmath59 as a matrix with row index @xmath60 and column index @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that with such a recombination , @xmath48 is a positive matrix and can be diagonalized @xmath62 where we have kept only the non - zero eigenvalues @xmath63 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath58 is then given by @xmath65 which are the matrices representing the new state .",
    "in retaining only the non - zero eigenvalues , we have reduced the physical dimension within the block to only those necessary for describing the entanglement between this block and the rest of the system .",
    "local entanglement within the block has been optimally removed .",
    "each renormalization step in the renormalization procedure hence works by grouping every @xmath14 consecutive sites together and then applying the above transformation to map @xmath55}$ ] , @xmath56}$ ] , ... , @xmath57}$ ] to @xmath66 .",
    "so one renormalization step maps the original matrices @xmath67}_{i_k})^{(0)}$ ] on each site to renormalized matrices @xmath67}_{i_k})^{(1)}$ ] on each block .",
    "repeating this procedure for a finite number of times corresponds to applying a finite depth quantum circuit to the original state .",
    "if the matrices reaches a simple fixed point form @xmath67}_{i_k})^{(\\infty)}$ ] ( up to local unitaries ) , we can determine from it the universal properties of the phase which the original state belongs to .    such a renormalization procedure hence provides a way to classify matrix product states under lu transformations by studying the fixed point @xmath67}_{i_k})^{(\\infty)}$ ] that a state flows to .",
    "two states are within the same phase if and only their corresponding fixed points states can be transformed into each other by ( symmetric ) lu transformations . in the following",
    "we will apply this method to study short - range correlated matrix product states which faithfully represent the class of 1d gapped ground states .",
    "the short - range correlation is an extra constraint on the set of matrix product states that we will consider .",
    "not all matrix product states describe gapped ground states of 1d spin systems .",
    "in particular , 1d gapped ground states all have finite correlation length@xcite for equal time correlators of any local operator , while matrix product states can be long - range correlated .",
    "the finite correlation length puts an extra constraint on mps that the eigen - spectrum of @xmath68 should have a non degenerate largest eigenvalue ( set to be 1 ) ( see appendix [ ndg]).@xcite therefore , we will assume this property of @xmath68 in our following discussion and corresponding mps will be called short - range correlated ( src ) mps .",
    "this renormalization method is well suited for the study of systems without translational invariance , which we will discuss in detail .",
    "we will also make an attempt to study translational invariant systems with this method .",
    "while the full translational symmetry is reduced to block translational symmetry in the rg process , by studying the resulting equivalence classes for different values of block size @xmath14 , we expect to obtain a more complete classification of translational invariant 1d systems .",
    "indeed , the classification result is further confirmed by using a translational invariant lu transformation in the time evolution form to study equivalence between ti systems .    in the following sections , we will present our analysis and results for different cases .",
    "first we will consider the situation where no specific symmetry is required for the system .",
    "when no symmetry is required for the class of system , we want to know what kind of long range entanglement exists and hence classify topological orders in 1d gapped spin systems .",
    "we will show that @xmath69 in other words , there is no topological order in 1d .",
    "this is similar to the generic case discussed in .    to obtain such a result ,",
    "we use the fact that gapped 1d spin states such that the state is the non - degenerate gapped ground state of @xmath70 . ]",
    "are described by short - range correlated ( src ) matrix product states .",

    "if the class of systems under consideration has certain symmetry , the equivalence classes of states are defined in terms of lu transformations that do not break the symmetry .",
    "therefore , when applying the renormalization procedure , we should carefully keep track of the symmetry and make sure that the resulting state has the same symmetry at each step .",
    "due to such a constrain on local unitary equivalence , we will see that gapped ground states which do not break the symmetry of the system divide into different universality classes corresponding to different symmetry protected topological orders .",
    "we will first discuss the case of on - site symmetries in detail for non - translational invariant ( nti ) systems , i.e. , the system has only an on - site symmetry and no translation symmetry .",
    "then we shall make an attempt to study translational invariant ( ti ) systems , with the possibility of having on - site symmetry or parity symmetry .",
    "lastly , we shall consider the case of time reversal symmetry .",

    "a projective representation of a symmetry group is generally allowed in a quantum description of system because the factor @xmath94 only changes the global phase of a quantum state but not any physically measurable quantity .",
    "therefore , in our classification , we will consider not only the case of linear representation , but also in general projective representations .",
    "the on - site symmetry is the only symmetry required for the class of system . in particular",
    ", we do not require translational symmetry for the systems .",
    "however , for a simple definition of phase , we will assume certain uniformness in the state , which we will define explicitly in the following .",
    "we will classify possible phases for different @xmath0 when the ground state is invariant ( up to a total phase ) under such on - site symmetry operations and is gapped ( short - range correlated ) . specifically , the ground state @xmath95 on @xmath96 sites satisfies @xmath97 and @xmath96 dependent phase factors .",

    "it is important to keep track of the symmetry while doing renormalization .",
    "first , in the renormalization procedure we group @xmath14 sites together into a new site .",
    "the on - site symmetry transformation becomes @xmath100 , which is again a linear representation of @xmath0 .",

    "no matter what the change is , the right virtual spin on the site to the left of the region corresponding to @xmath304 should form a singlet with some degrees of freedom in the region . as the singlet is invariant under a linear representation of @xmath0",
    ", these degrees of freedom in the region must form a projective representation of @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath441 .",
    "these degrees of freedom could live on one site or distribute over several sites .",
    "however , the sites only support linear representations .",
    "therefore , there must be some remaining degrees of freedom on the same sites that correspond to @xmath304 .",
    "these remaining degrees of freedom must form singlets again with other degrees of freedoms in the region that correspond to @xmath441 .",
    "we can continue this argument until finally some degree of freedom in the region corresponding to @xmath441 connect with the left virtual spin on the site to the right of the region corresponding to @xmath304 and form a singlet .    in fig .",

    "white dots correspond to @xmath381 , the identity element in @xmath116 , black dots correspond to @xmath304 and gray dots correspond to @xmath441 .",
    "therefore , we can see that no matter what the symmetric lu operation might be on @xmath429 , singlet entangled pairs related to @xmath304 must connect head to tail and cover the whole length of the chain .",
    "in other words , we can not shrink a chain of singlet entangled pairs related to non - trivial @xmath304 continuously to a point or change it to @xmath305 by acting on it locally and without breaking the symmetry . hence fixed point states with different @xmath113",
    "can not be related to each other with symmetric lu transformation and hence belong to different classes .",

    "we have been using the quantum circuit formulation to study ti systems and classify b - phases .",
    "as the quantum circuit explicitly breaks translational symmetry , it is possible that each b - phase contains several different ti phases .",
    "( on the other hand , states in different b - phases must belong to different ti phases . ) in this section , we will show that each b - phase actually corresponds to a single ti phase by establishing a ti lu transformation between states in the same b - phase .",
    "we will use the time evolution formulation of lu transformation and find a smooth path of gapped ti hamiltonian whose adiabatic evolution connects two states within the same b - phase .",
    "first , as an example , we consider the case of ti only and show that there is only one gapped ti phase .",
    "each ti src mps is described(up to local change of basis ) by a double tensor @xmath68 which has a non - degenerate largest eigenvalue @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath68 can be written as @xmath460 where @xmath461 is the eigenvector of eigenvalue @xmath78 and @xmath462 is of eigenvalue less than @xmath78 . in",
    "the ` canonical form'@xcite , @xmath463 , @xmath464 .",
    "obviously , @xmath465 is a valid double tensor and represents a state in fixed point form .",
    "we can smoothly change @xmath68 to @xmath465 by turning down the @xmath462 term to @xmath128 from @xmath466 to @xmath467 as @xmath468 every @xmath469 represents a ti src mps state . to see this , note that if we recombine the indices @xmath60 as row index and @xmath61 as column index and denote the new matrix as @xmath325 , then both @xmath325 and @xmath470 are positive semidefinite matrices .",
    "but then every @xmath471 is also positive semidefinite , as for any vector @xmath472 @xmath473 @xmath469 is hence a valid double tensor and the state represented can be determined by decomposing @xmath469 back into matrices @xmath474 .",
    "such a decomposition is not unique but wlog , we can fix the decomposition scheme , so that @xmath474 vary continuously with time and reach the fixed point form at @xmath467(up to local change of basis ) .",
    "the state represented @xmath475 hence also changes smoothly with @xmath476 and has a finite correlation length as all eigenvalues of @xmath469 expect for @xmath78 are diminishing with @xmath476 .",
    "therefore , @xmath469 represents a smooth path in ti src mps that connects any state to a fixed point state(up to local change of basis ) .    how do we know that no phase transition happens along the path ?",
    "this is because for every state @xmath475 , we can find a parent hamiltonian which changes smoothly with @xmath476 and has the state as a unique gapped ground state.@xcite following the construction in , we choose a sufficiently large but finite @xmath477 and set the parent hamiltonian to be @xmath478 , where @xmath479 is the projection onto the support space of the reduced density matrix on site @xmath26 to @xmath480 at time @xmath476 .",
    "note that this hamiltonian is translation invariant . for large enough @xmath477",
    ", @xmath479 will always be @xmath37 dimensional . as the state changes continuously ,",
    "its reduced density matrices of site @xmath26 to @xmath480 changes smoothly . because the dimension of the space does not change , @xmath479 also changes smoothly with time . moreover",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath481 is always gapped as the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath469 never approaches @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "therefore , by evolving the hamiltonian adiabatically from @xmath466 to @xmath467 , we obtain a local unitary transformation@xcite connecting any state to the fixed point form , and in particular without breaking the translation symmetry .      if the system is ti and has on - site symmetry , we need to maintain the on - site symmetry while doing the smooth deformation . a ti src mps which is symmetric under on - site symmetry of group @xmath0",
    "is described by matrices which satisfy @xmath482 for some invertible projective representation @xmath288 .",
    "the double tensor @xmath68 hence satisfies @xmath483 where the group element label @xmath291 has been omitted .",
    "being the non - degenerate one - dimensional eigenspace of @xmath68 , @xmath465 must be invariant under the same transformation , and so does @xmath462 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath484 now we smoothly change the double tensor as in eqn.[et ] .",
    "evidently , the symmetry condition eqn.[symm_e ] is satisfied for all @xmath476 .    decompose @xmath469 back to matrices @xmath474",
    "so that the represented state @xmath475 changes smoothly with time . denote the symmetry transformed double tensor as @xmath485 . as @xmath486",
    ", there must exist a unitary operator @xmath487 , such that @xmath488 where @xmath487 is a linear representation of @xmath0 .",
    "redefine @xmath489 , then @xmath490 as @xmath474 is chosen to be continuous with time , from the above equation we can see that @xmath491 is also continuous in time . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath491 form a linear representation of @xmath0 .",
    "for all the cases we are interested in , the linear representations of @xmath0 are discrete .",
    "therefore , as @xmath491 evolves smoothly with time , it can not change from one representation to another but only from one equivalent form to another which differ by a unitary conjugation .",
    "that is , @xmath492 , with a continuous @xmath493",
    ". we can incorporate @xmath493 into the matrices @xmath474 and define @xmath494 , so that @xmath495 is symmetric under @xmath4 for all @xmath476 . in the following discussion",
    ", we will assume that such a redefinition is made and the symmetry operation of the system will always be @xmath496 .",
    "therefore , the continuous evolution of @xmath469 from @xmath466 to @xmath467 corresponds to a continuous evolution of short range correlated states @xmath475 which is always symmetric under the same on - site symmetry @xmath4 , with the same phase factor @xmath497 and related to the same projective representation @xmath113 .",
    "such a smooth path in symmetric state space corresponds to a smooth path in symmetric hamiltonian space .",
    "construct parent hamiltonian as discussed previously .",
    "because the state is symmetric under on - site @xmath4 , the support space on site @xmath26 to @xmath480 must then form a representation space for @xmath498 . therefore , it is easy to see that the parent hamiltonian , being a summation of projections onto such spaces , is also symmetry under on - site @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian remains gapped and ti . in this way",
    ", we have found a smooth path of symmetric , in particular ti , hamiltonian whose adiabatic evolution connects any symmetric state labeled by @xmath191 and @xmath113 to the corresponding fixed point state(up to a local change of basis ) and hence establishing the symmetric ti lu equivalence between them .    as we show in appendix [ equiv ] that fixed point states with the same @xmath191 and @xmath113",
    "can be related by symmetric local unitary transformations to each other , we now complete the proof that _ for 1d spin systems with only translation and an on - site linear symmetry @xmath0 , all gapped phases that do not break the two symmetries are classified by a pair @xmath499 where @xmath500 label different types of projective representations of @xmath0 and @xmath192 label different 1d representations of @xmath0 .",
    "_    similarly , if the system has translation and parity symmetry , we can establish the equivalence between states labeled by the same @xmath501 and @xmath502 in a translational invariant way ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "the procedure is totally analogous to the on - site symmetry case , with the only difference that the symmetry condition for the matrices and double tensors become @xmath503 we find that _ for 1d spin systems with only translation and parity symmetry , there are four gapped phases that do not break the two symmetries . _                                                                                                  n. schuch , d. prez - garca and j. i. cirac , talk given on ` international workshop on density matrix renormalization group and other advances on numerical renormalization group methods ' , beijing , china , 2010 ( http://physics.ruc.edu.cn/meeting/20090915/3109.pdf ) ."
