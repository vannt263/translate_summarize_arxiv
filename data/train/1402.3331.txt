    "microphone arrays are widely used in speech communication applications such as hands - free telephony , hearing aids , speech recognition , and teleconferencing systems .",
    "beamforming is often used with microphone arrays to enhance a speech signal from a preferred spatial direction  @xcite . in general , the beamforming approach can be fixed or adaptive , depending upon whether the spatial directivity pattern is fixed  @xcite-@xcite , or varies adaptively on the basis of incoming data  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "though adaptive beamforming performs better when the acoustic environment is time - varying , fixed beamforming is preferred in applications where the direction of the sound source is fixed , such as in in - car communication systems  @xcite or in hearing aids .",
    "in addition , fixed beamformers have lower computational complexity and are easier to implement .    in many beamformer applications , such as in - car communication systems , voice recognition systems , video conferencing systems , etc .",
    ", there is often a need to ensure that the gain across the passband has little variation from unity while that in the stopband is always below a prescribed level . at the same time , a passband with good linear - phase characteristics is usually preferred to avoid any signal distortion .",
    "consequently , a straightforward approach for the design of such beamformers is to formulate the problem in terms of the @xmath0 norm as it leads to a minimax optimization of the appropriate error functions  @xcite .    in  @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "designs for broadband beamformers that are not constrained by the size of the array aperture or are based on the assumption of ideal or known microphone characteristics have been proposed",
    ". however , in certain applications such as in hearing aid and in - car communication systems there are physical constraints on the array aperture size such that the wavelength of the signal in the lower end of the frequency band is much longer than the maximum allowed aperture length .",
    "consequently , as evident from earlier designs for superdirective narrowband arrays  @xcite-@xcite , broadband beamformers designed for physically - compact applications can become very sensitive to errors in array imperfections and therefore robustness constraints need to be incorporated in the design . in  @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the statistics of microphone characteristics are taken into account to derive broadband beamformers that are robust to microphone mismatches , while in  @xcite the white noise gain ( wng ) is incorporated in the design to ensure that the beamformer is robust to spatial white noise and array imperfections .",
    "the use of the wng constraint is not new and has been used in earlier beamformer designs to ensure robustness in superdirective beamformers  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown in  @xcite that the use of statistical properties of the microphone characteristics in  @xcite to improve the beamformer robustness is also a class of the wng constrained - based technique .",
    "nevertheless , efforts to design robust broadband beamformers with a frequency - invariant beampattern have been carried out only in recent years  @xcite-@xcite .    in the method in  @xcite",
    ", the beamformer is designed by performing an @xmath1 minimization of the desired beamformer response while constraining the response at the centre of the passband to unity and the wng to be above a prescribed level .",
    "the method in  @xcite , however , is not very effective for designing broadband beamformers where the maximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation is specified since it is based on optimizing the @xmath1 norm of the error rather than the @xmath0 norm .",
    "further , the method is only applicable when the prescribed group delay is zero .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a method for designing robust broadband beamformers with good linear - phase characteristics in the passband while ensuring that the maximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation are below and above specified levels , respectively . in the method",
    ", we use the @xmath0 norm of the error to formulate the optimization problem .",
    "two novel variants have been developed where the wng is constrained to be above prescribed levels across the frequency band . in the first variant ,",
    "the beamformer is formulated as a convex optimization problem where the maximum passband error is minimized .",
    "the second variant is formulated as an iterative second - order cone programming ( socp ) problem that minimizes the passband group - delay deviation , with the advantage of significantly improving the linear - phase characteristics of the beamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear - array configuration .",
    "the iterative socp has been extended from the design of iir filters , such as in  @xcite and  @xcite , to optimize the non - linear formulations of the wng and the group - delay deviation in the proposed method .",
    "it should be noted that in  @xcite , conformal arrays were designed by formulating the optimization problem as an iterative socp ; however , the method in  @xcite is primarily confined to the design of narrowband arrays where only the magnitude of the desired beam pattern is specified .",
    "to reduce the high computational effort associated with designing broadband beamformers using the iterative socp method , we extended the nonuniform sampling method , developed in  @xcite for the design of digital filters , to two dimensions : frequency and angles ; this has resulted in a reduction of the computational effort by more than an order of magnitude for the socp method .",
    "experimental results show that beamformers designed using the proposed methods have superior performance when compared to a modified version of an existing method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the filter - and - sum beamformer and the associated formulations of the beamformer response and wng for a uniform linear array in the far field .",
    "then in section iii , we develop formulations for variant 1 of the proposed method where the design is formulated as a convex optimization problem . in section iv",
    ", we develop formulations for variant 2 of the proposed method where the design is formulated as an iterative socp problem",
    ". then in section v , performance comparisons between the proposed design variants with a modified version of an existing method are carried out .",

    "an analogous approach is to decrease the length and width of the rectangular blocks in _ step b _ as we approach closer to the edges of the frequency and angular bands .",
    "for example , one option to achieve this is to assign fixed frequency - angle points near the frequency and angular band edges by simply setting the lengths and widths of the rectangular blocks to the unit virtual - sampling distance at those locations .      to evaluate the parameters that are dependent on the frequency and angles , the 2-d nonuniform variable sampling technique described in subsection iv - f",

    "typical values of @xmath139 that have been found to work well range between 500 to 5000 .    though the convergence speed depends on the initialization point , in most cases the optimization algorithms in ( [ iteroptproblem4 ] ) converge to a good solution within 50 iterations . in some cases",
    ", it has been observed that the solution keeps improving with each iteration , but beyond a certain point the degree of improvement is too small to be of practical significance and the optimization can be terminated .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that during the optimization iterations the objective function may at some point show very small improvement , or even increase for several iterations , before rapidly decreasing again . to ensure that the optimization is not prematurely terminated , the termination condition is decided by monitoring the values of the objective function for the last @xmath140 iterations .",

    "in addition , the designs with symmetry constraints also have perfectly symmetric beampatterns as seen from the plots in fig .",

    "iv , we again observe that design v2-a has the smallest @xmath174 for the non - symmetric beamformer specification of example 2 .",
    "we also observe that for this example , design c - a does not result in a feasible solution ; a possible reason for this infeasibility is the equality constraint in ( [ optproblem6 ] ) , which severely restricts the degrees of freedom in the optimization .    from the results in this subsection",
    ", we can conclude that for the design of beamformers where the prescribed group delay is 0 , design v2-a will give the smallest @xmath174 for the same values of maximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation .      in this subsection ,",

    "furthermore we also observe that though the beamformer designed using the method in  @xcite has a slightly better @xmath174 than design v1-a , the former has a much larger maximum passband - ripple value , which does not satisfy the given specifications in table xiii .",

    ", we plan to evaluate the performance of beamformers derived using the proposed techniques using speech and audio signals .",
    "the optimization problems in the examples were solved on a computer running an intel core i7 - 640lm processor using the sedumi optimization toolbox for matlab .",

    "each iteration of the optimization problem in ( [ iteroptproblem4 ] ) takes less than a minute to compute and",
    "the optimization usually converges to a good solution in less than 25 minutes .",
    "a new method for the design of linear - phase robust far - field broadband audio beamformers using constrained optimization has been described . in the method ,",
    "the maximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation are ensured to be within prescribed levels , while at the same time maintaining a good linear - phase characteristic at a prescribed group delay in the passband .",
    "since the beamformer is intended primarily for small - sized microphone arrays where the microphone spacing is small relative to the wavelength at low frequencies , the beamformer can become highly sensitive to spatial white noise and array imperfections if a direct minimization of the error is performed .",
    "therefore , to limit the sensitivity of the beamformer , the optimization was carried out by constraining a sensitivity parameter , namely , the white noise gain ( wng ) to be above prescribed levels across the frequency band .",

    "the first variant was formulated as a convex optimization problem where passband error is minimized , while the second variant was formulated as an iterative optimization problem with the advantage of significantly improving the linear phase characteristics of the beamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear - array configuration . in the second variant ,",
    "the passband group - delay deviation was minimized while ensuring that the maximum passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within prescribed levels . to reduce the computational effort in carrying out the optimization ,",
    "a nonuniform sampling approach over the frequency and angular dimensions was used to compute the required parameters .",
