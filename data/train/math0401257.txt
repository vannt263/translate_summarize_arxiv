    "conformal structures on the 2-torus @xmath1 ( elliptic curves ) are classified by a moduli space , which is the quotient of the upper half - plane @xmath3 by the action of the modular group @xmath2 by linear fractional transformations .",
    "in other words , equivalence classes of elliptic curves correspond to orbits of @xmath2 on @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath4 is not a smooth manifold , it is often easier to study properties of elliptic curves in terms of the _ action _ of @xmath2 on the smooth manifold @xmath3 .",
    "this note concerns the analogous question for _ complete affine structures _ on @xmath1 .",
    "complete affine structure _ on a manifold @xmath5 is a representation of @xmath5 as the quotient of affine space @xmath6 by a discrete group of affine transformations .",
    "equivalence classes of such structures on @xmath1 identify with the orbits of @xmath2 on @xmath0 for the standard linear action of @xmath2 on @xmath0 .",
    "however , unlike the action on @xmath3 , this action is _ not proper _ and the quotient space is even more badly behaved . in particular",
    "it fails to be hausdorff and since the action of @xmath2 on @xmath0 is ergodic @xcite , it also enjoys a nonstandard borel structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the coordinates in @xmath3 , parametrizing elliptic curves , are defined by the periods of holomorphic 1-forms .",
    "analogously , we use periods of parallel 1-forms to define coordinates on the deformation space of complete affine structures on @xmath1 .",
    "these coordinates define a natural differentiable structure on this deformation space , under which it is diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "( using a different approach baues  @xcite noticed that this deformation space is homeomorphic to @xmath0 . )    whereas every smooth deformation of elliptic curves is induced by a _",
    "map into @xmath3 , the analogous result fails for the deformation space of complete affine structures on @xmath1 with respect to the coordinates given by the periods of parallel 1-forms .",
    "we provide an example of a smooth one - parameter deformation of an euclidean 2-torus , in fact an affine fibration , which corresponds to a continuous curve in the deformation space which is _ not _ smooth in the origin .",
    "the complete affine structures on @xmath1 were classified by kuiper  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the _ moduli space _ of such structures .",
    "as is often the case in moduli problems , the moduli space can be made more tractable by introducing extra structure  in this case a _ marking _ , and the moduli problem for marked structures is simpler .",
    "equivalence classes of marked structures form a space homeomorphic to the plane @xmath0 , which we call the _ deformation space . _ the moduli space",
    " consisting of equivalence classes of structures ( without marking )  is then the orbit space of @xmath0 by the standard linear action of @xmath2 .    that the deformation space of complete affine structures on @xmath1 is even hausdorff is in itself surprising .",
    "( the larger deformation space of ( not necessarily complete ) affine structures on @xmath1 is _ not _ hausdorff . )",
    "moreover , in our setup the group actions defining the moduli problem are not reductive , and hence the usual techniques of geometric invariant theory do not apply . indeed ,",
    "the affine structures discussed here all come from affine structures on abelian lie groups which are invariant under multiplication , and the resulting automorphisms of the affine structure form a unipotent group .",
    "+ benzecri @xcite ( see also milnor  @xcite ) proved that the only compact orientable surface which admits affine structures is the two - torus @xmath1 . the classification of affine structures on @xmath1 up to affine diffeomorphism , initiated by kuiper @xcite , was completed independently by furness - arrowsmith @xcite and nagano - yagi @xcite .    according to kuiper , the complete affine structures on the 2-torus fall into two types .",
    "quotients of @xmath7 by translations we call _ euclidean structures , _ since they admit compatible euclidean ( or flat riemannian ) metrics .",
    "the levi - civita connection of a compatible metric coincides with the flat connection associated to the affine structure .",
    "the euclidean structures fall into a single affine equivalence class , which corresponds to the origin in @xmath0 .",
    "the other structures are more exotic , and do not correspond to levi - civita connections of a ( possibly indefinite ) riemannian metric .",
    "the non - riemannian structures can be characterized as follows .",
    "let @xmath5 be a marked non - riemannian affine 2-torus .",
    "there is a parallel area form @xmath8 which we normalize to have area @xmath9 .",
    "then there exists a vector field @xmath10 , polynomial of degree @xmath9 , such that the covariant derivative @xmath11 is a nonzero parallel vector field . since",
    "parallel vector fields on @xmath5 are determined up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar , we can normalize @xmath12 by requiring that @xmath13 then the interior product @xmath14 is a parallel @xmath9-form on @xmath5 , uniquely determined by the affine structure of @xmath5 .",
    "the cohomology class @xmath15 \\in h^1(t^2;{{\\mathbb r}})\\ ] ] determines the equivalence class of the marked affine manifold @xmath5 .",
    "as non - euclidean structures converge to the euclidean structure , this cohomology class approaches zero , and the period mapping extends to a homeomorphism of the deformation space of _ all _ complete marked affine structures on @xmath1 with @xmath0 .",

    "+ for every complete affine structure on @xmath1 there is a commutative group operation on @xmath1 for which multiplication is affine .",
    "thus every complete affine 2-torus @xmath5 is a group object in the category of affine manifolds .",
    "such objects correspond to associative algebras , providing an alternative approach to the classification . from this viewpoint ,",
    "a marked complete affine structure on @xmath1 corresponds to a commutative associative nilpotent @xmath21-algebra , with a chosen basis corresponding to the marking .",
    "similarly matsushima @xcite showed that the set of all complex affine structures on a fixed _ complex torus _ forms an affine algebraic variety , by identifying each structure with the associative algebra which is formed by the holomorphic vector fields of the torus under the covariant differentiation of the affine structure .",
    "as a related fact the deformation spaces of complete affine structures on ( also higher dimensional ) real tori are homeomorphic to a real algebraic set @xcite . + in figure 1 - 9 we show various tilings of the plane which are obtained from affine group actions corresponding to different values of the period class .",

    "the manifold @xmath5 together with an affine structure is called an _ affine manifold . _",

    "given a local diffeomorphism @xmath31 , an affine structure @xmath5 determines a unique affine structure on @xmath32 such that @xmath31 is an affine map . thus covering spaces , and the universal covering space @xmath33 in particular , of affine manifolds",
