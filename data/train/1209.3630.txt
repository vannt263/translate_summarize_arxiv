    "in this paper we derive exact solutions for a diffusive predator - prey system @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are positive parameters .",
    "subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote partial derivatives .",
    "the equations are expressed in dimensionless variables , where scaling of space and time have been introduced so to have the equation in a simple form .",
    "the biological meaning of the each term has been discussed in @xcite , which we briefly review .",
    "the model is of the predator - prey kind , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the densities of prey and predator .",
    "spatial redistribution of the population is governed by diffusive dynamics , with both species having the same diffusivities , @xcite . in absence of the predator ,",
    "the temporal dynamics of the prey density is of the allee type @xcite , small populations being not viable .",
    "presence of the predator population negatively affects the prey population . in turn , the predator population is totally dependent on prey availability , as the only term in the predator equation that represents the growth of the population is the @xmath10 term , where @xmath2 quantifies the gain in natality due to prey consumption . the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 represent the per capita mortality rate of prey and predator respectively , in the linear , small populations , limit .",
    "finally , the @xmath11 is a closure relation taking into account the effects of higher trophic levels @xcite .    to investigate the dynamics of the above diffusive predator - prey system the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have assumed the following relations between the parameters , namely @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in other words",
    "it has been assumed that the per capita mortality rate of prey and predator are equal and the rate of biomass production at the lower level must be consistent with the rate of biomass assimilation at the upper level of the web @xcite . under this assumption eq .",
    "( [ qqq1 ] ) reads @xmath14 in our work also we consider the predator - prey system ( [ qqq6 ] ) only .",
    "we construct exact analytic solutions to the equation ( [ qqq6 ] ) in order to understand the properties of this model for different parametric values .",
    "to do so we employ the @xmath0 expansion method @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to several nonlinear evolutionary equations . here",
    "we demonstrate that the utility of this method in exploring dynamics of a diffusive predator - prey system .",
    "while implementing @xmath0 expansion method to equation ( [ qqq6 ] ) we obtain exact solutions for two different wave speeds ( vide eqs .",
    "( [ qqq17 ] ) and ( [ qqq18 ] ) ) . in both the cases we give three different types of exact solutions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . to begin with , in sec .",
    "2 , we describe the @xmath0 expansion method . in sec . 3 , we consider eq .",
    "( [ qqq6 ] ) and derive exact solutions of it . finally , we present our conclusion in sec .",
    "in this section we discuss briefly the method of finding exact solutions for a system of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) using @xmath15-expansion method .",
    "suppose that the system of nonlinear pdes is of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two unknown functions and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are polynomials in @xmath17 and @xmath18 and their partial derivatives .",
    "the @xmath15 expansion method involves the following four steps .",
    "@xmath21 let us introduce the travelling wave reduction @xmath22 in the pde ( [ aaa1 ] ) so that the latter becomes @xmath23 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to the new variable @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 suppose that the solution of @xmath26 can be expressed by a polynomial in @xmath27 , that is @xmath28 with @xmath29 is the solution of the second order linear damped harmonic oscillator equation @xmath30 in the above @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants and @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the positive integers @xmath4 and @xmath35 can be determined by substituting ( [ aaa4 ] ) in ( [ aaa3 ] ) and considering the homogeneous balance between the highest order derivative and nonlinear terms appearing in ( [ aaa3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath36 substituting ( [ aaa4 ] ) in ( [ aaa3 ] ) and eliminating the variable @xmath37 in the resultant equations by using ( [ aaa5 ] ) one gets two polynomials equations in @xmath27 . now equating each coefficients of @xmath38 and @xmath39 to zero",
    "one obtains a set of algebraic equations for the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 . solving these algebraic equations one can get exact values for these coefficients .",
    "@xmath40 substituting the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath41 and the general solution of ( [ aaa5 ] ) in ( [ aaa4 ] ) one can obtain three different types of travelling wave solutions for the given system of nonlinear pdes .",
    "in this section , we apply the method described in the previous section to the nonlinear pdes ( [ qqq6 ] ) and construct exact solutions . substituting ( [ aaa2 ] ) into ( [ qqq6 ] )",
    "we get the following system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , namely @xmath42 suppose that the solution of odes ( [ qqq9 ] ) can be expressed by a polynomial in @xmath27 which is of the form ( [ aaa4 ] ) .    substituting ( [ aaa4 ] ) and their derivatives in ( [ qqq9 ] ) and performing the homogeneous balance between @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath45 with @xmath46 in resultant equation we find @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "so we fix the polynomials ( [ aaa4 ] ) be of the form @xmath49 substituting the expressions ( [ qqq13 ] ) and their derivatives in ( [ qqq9 ] ) and rearranging the resultant equation in the descending powers of @xmath50 we arrive at @xmath51\\big(\\frac{g'}{g}\\big)^3+[3\\alpha_1\\lambda - c\\alpha_1+k\\alpha_1 ^ 2+\\frac{\\alpha_1 ^ 2}{\\sqrt{\\delta}}-3\\alpha_1 ^ 2\\alpha_0-\\alpha_1\\beta_1]\\big(\\frac{g'}{g}\\big)^2 & & \\nonumber \\\\    + [ ( 2\\mu+\\lambda^2)\\alpha_1-c\\lambda \\alpha_1-\\beta\\alpha_1 + 2k\\alpha_0\\alpha_1+\\frac{2\\alpha_1\\alpha_0}{\\sqrt{\\delta}}-3\\alpha_0 ^ 2\\alpha_1-\\alpha_1\\beta_0-\\alpha_0\\beta_1]\\big(\\frac{g'}{g}\\big ) & & \\nonumber \\\\    + ( \\mu \\alpha_1\\lambda - c\\mu \\alpha_1-\\beta \\alpha_0+\\alpha_0 ^ 2+\\frac{\\alpha_0 ^ 2}{\\sqrt{\\delta}}-\\alpha_0 ^ 3-\\alpha_0\\beta_0 ) = 0 , \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52\\big(\\frac{g'}{g}\\big)^3+[3\\beta_1\\lambda - c\\beta_1+k\\alpha_1\\beta_1 - 3\\delta\\beta_1 ^ 2\\beta_0]\\big(\\frac{g'}{g}\\big)^2 & & \\nonumber \\\\    + [ ( 2\\mu+\\lambda^2)\\beta_1-c\\lambda \\beta_1-\\beta\\beta_1+k\\alpha_0\\beta_1+k\\alpha_1\\beta_0 - 3\\delta\\beta_0 ^ 2\\beta_1]\\big(\\frac{g'}{g}\\big ) & & \\nonumber \\\\    + ( \\mu \\beta_1\\lambda - c\\mu \\beta_1-\\beta \\beta_0+k\\alpha_0\\beta_0-\\delta\\beta_0 ^ 3 ) = 0 .",

    "in this paper , we have constructed exact solutions for a diffusive predator - prey system which is modeled by a system of two coupled nonlinear pdes . using the @xmath0 expansion method ,",
    "we have derived exact solutions for two different wave speeds .",
    "the solutions that we have obtained are singular and can not be taken at face value describing actual situations in ecology .",
    "notwithstanding they present a very interesting property : depending on the sign of @xmath110 , the nature of the solution changes from a single structure to a periodic one , which is akin to pattern forming systems .",
    "we express @xmath110 in terms of the original parameters in the equation , we get @xmath111 . therefore , if @xmath112 we have a single structure like in fig.(1 ) . and if @xmath113 we have a periodic structure .",
    "the meaning of @xmath2 is that it measures the gain in natality obtained by the predator , and @xmath5 is its mortality .",
    "it follows that periodic structure formation comes from the strength of mortality . in a more intuitive way ,",
    "@xmath114 is the inverse of the typical time for a predator population to decay in absence of preys .",
    "if this time is short , we have a periodic pattern , the population continuously decaying and recovering . if this time is long , a smoother dynamics shows up .",
    "the equations for which we could find new solutions , besides the previously known , @xcite , have the obvious drawback that matching of coefficients is necessary .",
    "this is the same situation in most cases in the subject of exact solutions for reaction - diffusion equations , beyond the specific cases of interest in biology , @xcite .",
    "however , the broad view insight gained remains of interest as the systems considered contain many elements of more realistic , non solvable ones .    * *",
