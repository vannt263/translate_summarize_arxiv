    "recently , independent cosmological observations have turned out to be consistent with a canonical model of the structure formation based on the assumption that the main ingredients of our universe are the cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and the dark energy component such as a cosmological constant . introducing the unknown dark matter and",
    "the peculiar dark energy could have been thought of as somewhat artificial at the time when observations were not constraining enough , now this model has become more and more convincing with remarkable observational support .    to make a cosmological model truly convincing , it is important to make sure that any possible observations are consistent with that model .",
    "this can be accomplished by determining cosmological parameters as precisely as possible from each observation , and then comparing the results with one another .",
    "so far the individual observations were only able to constrain the parameters into some region in a multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "therefore , it is quite common to combine different observations to obtain the tight constraint on the parameters .",
    "a striking example is a combination of fluctuations in cosmic microwave background @xcite and a hubble diagram of supernova ia @xcite which is considered to be the prominent evidence of the current canonical model .",
    "however , one can test the consistency of the theory only when each observation can independently constrain the parameters in a sufficiently small region . in this paper",
    ", we explore the capabilities of redshift surveys in this respect . in redshift surveys , there are several degrees of freedom in planning survey strategies : the area and the depth of a survey , and the choice of specific targets for the spectroscopic measurements . each of these affects the analysis in a different and complex fashion .",
    "thus , it is important to estimate the impact of a given strategy on the cosmological analysis of the data .    in this paper",
    ", we apply our considerations to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "it is not only the largest ongoing redshift survey , but it also contains three different types of spectroscopic targets within the same area of the sky that can be used to infer cosmological information .    in deep , wide redshift surveys like sdss , the apparent clustering properties in observable redshift space are complicated because of the redshift - evolution and redshift - distortion effects . in linear regime , with a standard initial gaussian density field , the correlation function @xmath0 or the power spectrum @xmath1 completely characterizes the statistical property of the density field",
    ". spatial homogeneity and isotropy in real space guarantees these to be one - dimensional functions of the scale , @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "so it is usual to estimate the real - space power spectrum with certain correction methods or ansatz from observed redshift - space data , in order to compare with the theoretical prediction of various cosmological models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the redshift - evolution and redshift - distortion also have invaluable information on cosmology .",
    "the redshift - evolution of the density fluctuations depends on the growth factor which is a function of the density parameter @xmath4 and the normalized cosmological constant parameter @xmath5 .",
    "it is also a function of the galaxy bias @xmath6 which contains the information on the unknown galaxy formation process .",
    "the redshift - distortion depends on the density - velocity relation which is a function of @xmath7 @xcite , and also on @xmath4 and @xmath5 through geometrical distortions @xcite .",
    "when our main purpose is not only determining the power spectrum of initial fluctuations , but also constraining above parameters , it is desirable to directly analyze the data to obtain cosmological information without any intermediate statistical quantities like the power spectrum .",
    "since the apparent clustering in redshift space is quite different from that in real space , we can take advantage of the maximum - likelihood method to directly constrain cosmological models from the apparent clustering data in redshift space .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we focused on how near - future redshift surveys can constrain the cosmological constant by the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "since the redshift surveys become larger and larger , even the multi - dimensional parameter space can be constrained by redshift surveys alone . combining with other cosmological observations like the cosmic microwave background fluctuations , hubble diagram of the type ia supernova , and so on",
    ", one can constrain the parameters more accurately . however , independent observational constraints can serve as a consistency check of the fundamental cosmological model . in this respect ,",
    "we investigate how one can constrain the multi - dimensional parameter space of the standard cdm model with cosmological constant from redshift surveys , extending our previous work .",
    "in maximum - likelihood methods , we directly deal with the density fluctuations in redshift space . in order to do this",
    ", first we place smoothing cells in redshift space and consider the number of objects @xmath8 in each cell @xmath9 .",
    "each count represents the smoothed density field contaminated by shot noise . for given mean number densities , @xmath10 , the density fluctuations @xmath11 are the fundamental quantities to be analyzed . in the following ,",
    "the most important statistical quantity is the correlation matrix , @xmath12 .",
    "this matrix is related to a continuous two - point correlation function in redshift space @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the underlying continuous density contrast which survey objects trace .",
    "the relation between the correlation matrix and the correlation function is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the smoothing kernel in redshift space , normalized as @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the mean number density .",
    "the last term represents contribution from the shot noise effect . in linear regime ,",
    "the two - point correlation function in redshift space is analytically given , including high redshift effect .",
    "although the general form is fairly complicated @xcite , the distant - observer approximation @xcite , which is applicable in many cases , simplify the analysis below .",
    "the corresponding formula @xcite is given by @xmath19     \\left[1 + \\beta(z_2 ) \\frac{{k_\\parallel}^2}{k^2 } \\right ] p(k ) , \\label{eq1 - 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the redshifts of the two points , @xmath22 is the line - of - sight component of the wave number , @xmath1 is the linear mass power spectrum at @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the linear growth rate normalized as @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the bias factor at redshift @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the redshift distortion parameter , which is accurately fitted by the redshift - dependent mass density parameter @xmath29 and normalized cosmological constant @xmath5 as @xmath30/70\\}/b(z)$ ] @xcite .",
    "the vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the comoving positions of the two points which are labeled by @xmath33 and @xmath34 in redshift space ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    except for the nearby universe ,",
    "the comoving distance is not proportional to the redshift so that the smoothing kernel @xmath35 in redshift space is distorted along the line of sight . in a distant - observer regime ,",
    "a line - of - sight component @xmath36 and a transverse component @xmath37 of redshift - space separation @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are corresponding line - of - sight and transverse components of real - space separation , respectively , and @xmath27 is the mean redshift . we have chosen the unit system @xmath42 here for simplicity .",
    "this unit system simplifies the equations in this section .",
    "we mention that another unit system for length is introduced in  [ sec4 ] for a practical reason which is explained there . in the above transform ,",

    "unfortunately , such numerical integration increases cpu time and decreases accuracy .",
    "this is crucial for the analysis of the real data , because the position of kernels can hardly be regular so that one has to calculate the correlation matrix pair by pair .",
    "the shape of the kernel is not important for largely separated pairs , but it affects nearby and identical pairs .    although one can not exactly know what is the distortion unless the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fixed , it turns out to be a good approximation to set an approximate spherical kernel in real space with approximate values of these parameters .",
    "in fact , we found that the latter approximation is better than doing the exact numerical integration which inevitably has integration errors . when the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 should also be determined in real analyses",

    "although we only use the top - hat kernel in this paper , it is also useful to consider another possibility as digression , since this fast numerical approximations will also be used in the analysis of the real data .",
    "the top - hat kernel is not a smooth function , thus it is sometimes desirable to have an smoother kernel .",

    "it is desirable to have a degree of freedom to choose an appropriate rank @xmath79 , because one can optimize the analysis depending on the nature of an individual data set .",

    "in linear regime where the density fluctuations are considered to be random gaussian , this function is simply the multi - variate gaussian distribution function : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the inverse matrix of the correlation matrix @xmath104 .",
    "the matrix @xmath105 is the function of cosmological parameters @xmath99 as noted above .",
    "thus , calculation of the likelihood function is reduced to the calculation of equation ( [ eq1 - 4 ] ) for a given survey geometry and selection function for various cosmological models .",
    "the fisher information matrix , @xmath106 where @xmath107 represents the averaging over the possible data realization given the model parameters , is the key quantity in estimation theory , because the cramr - rao theorem @xcite states that an unbiased estimator constrains the model parameters with a minimum variance @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the inverse matrix of the fisher matrix and @xmath110 is the deviation of the estimated value @xmath111 from the `` true '' value @xmath112 . in the above equation , the notation @xmath113 means that the matrix whose @xmath114-elements are given by @xmath115 is positive semidefinite .",

    "if the parameter likelihood function @xmath95 is gaussian , the concentration ellipsoid with a fixed value of @xmath119 represents the @xmath120 confidence level when one uses the maximum likelihood estimate .",
    "although in general the parameter likelihood function is not gaussian , the concentration ellipsoids still give the rough idea of expected error bounds with a given confidence level of @xmath119 .",
    "when the parameter space is just two - dimensional , one can easily plot the concentration ellipses .",
    "the presentation of higher - dimensional space is not easy .",
    "we have at most seven parameters in our model : @xmath121 . to depict the higher dimensional concentration ellipsoids",
    ", we can plot all the possible two - dimensional parameter spaces which are marginalized over all the other parameters .",
    "this gives the idea how one can impose the constraints in the multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "although the form of the parameter likelihood function is not known , we can assume it is approximated by a multi - variate gaussian function so that @xmath122 . in which case ,",
    "the marginalization over the other parameters but two can be performed .",
    "for example , from the standard gaussian integration , marginalized 2-dimensional likelihood function for two parameters @xmath112 and @xmath123 is given by @xmath124^{-1 }      \\left (        \\begin{array}{c }          \\delta\\theta_\\alpha \\\\",

    "therefore , plotting the concentration ellipses in the marginalized parameter space is straightforward : they are given by contours of the equation ( [ eq1 - 14 ] ) .",
    "generally , concentration ellipsoids in the marginalized parameter sub - space are deduced from the sub - matrix of the full inverse fisher matrix .",
    "the largest redshift map which will be available in next several years is the sdss survey .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest how the maximum - likelihood method described in  [ sec2 ] can constrain various cosmological parameters .",
    "we have seen in  [ sec3 ] that it is straightforward to estimate the expected constraints on parameters given the survey geometry .",
    "we examine the maximum - likelihood method with the sdss geometry as a typical application of our method .",
    "redshift - space observations in the sdss survey consist of three samples of objects @xcite .",
    "the first sample is the set of approximately 1,000,000 `` main galaxies '' , which are selected by limiting an @xmath126-band magnitude .",
    "the redshift of main galaxies extends up to @xmath127 .",
    "the second sample is the set of approximately 120,000 `` luminous red galaxies '' ( lrg s ) , which are selected on the basis of color and magnitude @xcite . because of the clever selection criteria , the lrg s are essentially a distance - limited sample whose redshift extends up to @xmath128 .",

    "the redshift of the quasar sample extends up to @xmath129 .    in evaluating fisher information matrices , the precise geometry of the survey",
    "is not needed , and one can approximate the survey geometry to reduce the numerically intense procedure of inverting huge matrices .",
    "we setup a generic cubic box with 1,000 cells for each samples .",
    "the redshift of the box is set to be a `` mean '' redshift of each sample : @xmath130 for main galaxies , @xmath131 for lrg s , and @xmath132 for quasars .",
    "the precise value of this mean redshift is not a decisive factor in the fisher matrix evaluations .",
    "the finiteness of the spatial volume and the number density of the objects are the main source of the statistical uncertainty , i.e. , cosmic variance and shot noise . from the sky coverage of the three samples of the sdss spectroscopic survey , which is about pi - steradian , and from the redshift distribution of each samples",
    ", one can obtain expected spatial volumes and number densities for each sample .",

    ". thus , we use a different unit system when we have to mention the length scale in the following paragraphs .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a coordinate system in which radial distance @xmath49 to the objects is measured by redshift times hubble length : @xmath134 , directly observable quantity , instead of the comoving distance .",
    "the latter depends on cosmological models through parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which we would like to measure .",
    "we introduce the factor @xmath135 in the definition of @xmath49 simply in order to avoid the small figures when we mention 10 - 100 mpc scales .",
    "this measure of the radial distance @xmath49 is a linear extrapolation of the distance - redshift relation of the nearby universe .",
    "we save the unit @xmath136 for the usual comoving coordinates , and we use a new notation @xmath137 for the measure @xmath49 .",
    "the relation of the distance @xmath49 and the comoving distance @xmath48 is redshift - dependent and is given by a differential form , @xmath138 .",
    "in the unit system @xmath139 and @xmath42 which we used in previous sections , the distance @xmath49 is simply the redshift @xmath27 .",
    "we put the 1,000 cells in a generic cubic box of @xmath140 on regular @xmath141 sites in redshift space .",
    "the top - hat kernel [ @xmath81 in equation ( [ eq1 - 6 ] ) ] is used and the radius @xmath50 of the kernel is just a half of the cell separation : @xmath142 , so that there are no overlapping regions to ensure the independence of the cell volumes . the fisher matrix is straightforwardly calculated for this generic cubic region .",
    "this generic box is smaller than the sdss survey volume , therefore the fisher matrix can be rescaled as if the whole survey volume consisted of many independent generic cubic boxes .",
    "one can easily see that the fisher matrix of the composite sample is just given by a sum of fisher matrices of the individual samples .",
    "although we will miss the information from correlations between the boxes , the signals from the correlation at such large separations are very small .",
    "the box size @xmath143 is chosen so that the cell radius be large enough to track the linear regime and not to have large shot noise .",
    "on the other hand , too large @xmath143 makes the cosmic variance large .",

    "this is because the information from cross terms in the redshift bins of @xmath159 are already ignored in our analysis , and the likelihood function with a fixed bias parameter is not too sensitive to the bias parameter @xcite .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",

    "thus , the inverse of square - root of each diagonal element gives the fractional error relative to the fiducial value of each parameter when a single parameter is determined knowing the other parameters .",
    "the square - root of the diagonal elements of the inverse of any sub - matrix gives the fractional error of the parameters when corresponding parameters are simultaneously determined .",
    "basically , the lrg s can impose constraints on each parameter comparable to , or even better than main galaxies .",
    "the reason that the main galaxies do not work so well ( even though their number is 10 times larger than that of lrg s ) is that we only use the linear regime of the clustering .",
    "therefore , the depth of the lrg sample is more critical for the parameter estimation than the higher density of the main galaxies .",
    "the quasars are hopeless when many parameters are simultaneously determined , because of their extreme sparseness . in this way",
    ", our analysis gives the idea how the dense sampling affects cosmological parameter estimations .",
    "in this paper , we described a maximum - likelihood method to determine the cosmological parameters from apparent redshift - space clustering .",
    "we took advantage of the analytical formula for linear two - point correlations in redshift space with cosmological distortions .",
    "we introduced an accurate approximation in calculating the elements of the correlation matrix among cells in redshift - space .",
    "this step makes the method practically feasible in spite of the large dimensionality of the correlation matrices .    in the maximum - likelihood method",
    ", one can easily evaluate the expected parameter estimation errors in any sample from the fisher information matrix .",
    "we have calculated the seven - dimensional fisher matrix for three types of objects in the sdss survey : main galaxies , lrgs and quasars . to illustrate the behavior of the multi - dimensional fisher matrix we have used concentration ellipses in marginalized two - dimensional parameter space .    in this paper , we divided the survey volume into generic boxes in order to simplify the fisher matrix estimation .",
    "we ignored the correlations between these sub - regions , so the constraints will improve somewhat if those correlations are properly included .",
    "however , the inversion of the resulting huge matrices can become extremely time - consuming .",
    "the use of the karhunen - love ( kl ) transform is a practical strategy in this case .",
    "such methods can also be used in a targeted data - compression role to find linear combinations of counts which retain as much information about the parameters as possible @xcite .",
    "the choice of the cell radius is somewhat arbitrary in this work .",
    "we choose the spherical cell with radius of @xmath248 for galaxies and lrgs , which is the border of the linear regime .",
    "with larger cell radius , the validity of the linear theory increases and the shot noise is reduced .",
    "the cosmic variance , however , increases with cell radius .",
    "the parameter estimation is dominated by the highest signal - to - noise modes , which are at large wavelength , in particular for the case of the lrg sample .",
    "the high frequency modes close to pixel scales mostly contain shot noise after the kl transformation . as a result",
    ", we believe our conclusions are not sensitive to the choice of the cell radius .",
    "a fully accurate determination of the optimal choice of the cell radius depends on the behavior of the nonlinear effects , so that a comparison with numerical simulation is needed , beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "we have considered three subsets of the sdss redshift data , spanning a wide range of depth , sampling density and intrinsic clustering strength .",
    "we found , that for measuring cosmological parameters in the linear regime there is a clear optimum , represented by the intermediate - redshift lrg s .",
    "the low spatial density of quasars is not overcome by their much larger depth , and the relatively small depth of the main sdss galaxies is not compensated by their high sampling density  the redshift is not high enough to test curvature , and their cosmic variance is too large .",
    "the lrg sample , much smaller in numbers than the main sample , and much shallower than the quasars is an excellent compromise between sampling density and cosmological depth .",
    "the constraints derived from the lrgs are much tighter than for the other two samples .",
    "the advantage of these intermediate - redshift objects , and the logic behind this optimum goes beyond the sdss . in designing future redshift surveys , it is important to find the right balance between the density of objects and the survey depth .",
    "their interplay can be quite complex , as we have shown here .",
    "the relation between accuracy and sky coverage is simple and can be estimated analytically .",
