    "invariant differential operators play very important role in the description of physical symmetries . in a recent paper @xcite we started the systematic explicit construction of invariant differential operators .",
    "we gave an explicit description of the building blocks , namely , the parabolic subgroups and subalgebras from which the necessary representations are induced .",
    "thus we have set the stage for study of different non - compact groups .    in the present paper we focus on the algebra  @xmath3 .",
    "the algebras @xmath0 belong to a narrow class of algebras , which we call conformal lie algebras , which have very similar properties to the canonical conformal algebras of minkowski space - time .",
    "this class was identified from our point of view in @xcite .",
    "the same class was identified independently from different considerations and under different names in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a sequel of @xcite , and due to the lack of space we refer to it and to @xcite for motivations and extensive list of literature on the subject .",
    "let @xmath5 be a semisimple non - compact lie group , and @xmath6 a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "then we have an iwasawa decomposition  @xmath7 , where  @xmath8   is abelian simply connected vector subgroup of  @xmath5 ,  @xmath9   is a nilpotent simply connected subgroup of  @xmath5   preserved by the action of  @xmath8 .",
    "further , let @xmath10 be the centralizer of @xmath8 in @xmath6 . then the subgroup  @xmath11   is a minimal parabolic subgroup of @xmath5 . a parabolic subgroup  @xmath12   is any subgroup of @xmath5 which contains a minimal parabolic subgroup .",
    "the importance of the parabolic subgroups comes from the fact that the representations induced from them generate all ( admissible ) irreducible representations of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "let  @xmath13   be a ( non - unitary ) character of  @xmath14 ,  @xmath15 , let  @xmath16   fix an irreducible representation  @xmath17   of  @xmath18   on a vector space  @xmath19 .",
    "we call the induced representation  @xmath20 ind@xmath21   an  _ elementary representation _ of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "their spaces of functions are : _",
    "=   \\ { c^(g , v _ )    ( gman )  =   e^-(h ) d^(m^-1 ) ( g ) } where  @xmath22 ,  @xmath23 ,  @xmath24 ,  @xmath25 .",
    "the representation action is the @xmath26 regular action : ( ^(g ) ) ( g )  =   ( g^-1g )  , g , gg  .    for our purposes",
    "we need to restrict to  _ maximal _   parabolic subgroups  @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 .",
    "thus , for our representations the character  @xmath13   is parameterized by a real number  @xmath29 , called the conformal weight or energy .",
    "an important ingredient in our considerations are the  _ highest / lowest weight representations _   of  @xmath30 .",
    "these can be realized as ( factor - modules of ) verma modules  @xmath31   over  @xmath32 , where  @xmath33 ,  @xmath34 is a cartan subalgebra of  @xmath32 , weight  @xmath35   is determined uniquely from @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "actually , since our ers will be induced from finite - dimensional representations of  @xmath37   ( or their limits ) the verma modules are always reducible .",
    "thus , it is more convenient to use  _ generalized verma modules _  @xmath38   such that the role of the highest / lowest weight vector @xmath39 is taken by the space  @xmath40 . for the generalized verma modules ( gvms )",
    "the reducibility is controlled only by the value of the conformal weight @xmath29 .",
    "relatedly , for the only the reducibility w.r.t .",
    "non - compact roots is essential .",
    "one main ingredient of our approach is as follows .",
    "we group the ( reducible ) ers with the same casimirs in sets called  _ multiplets _ @xcite .",
    "the multiplet corresponding to fixed values of the casimirs may be depicted as a connected graph , the vertices of which correspond to the reducible ers and the lines between the vertices correspond to intertwining operators .",
    "the explicit parametrization of the multiplets and of their ers is important for understanding of the situation .",
    "in fact , the multiplets contain explicitly all the data necessary to construct the .",
    "actually , the data for each consists of the pair  @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a ( non - compact ) positive root of  @xmath32 ,  @xmath43 , such that the bgg @xcite verma module reducibility condition ( for highest weight modules ) is fulfilled : ( + , ^ )  =   m  , ^2 / ( , )  .when holds then the verma module with shifted weight  @xmath44 ( or  @xmath45   for gvm and @xmath42 non - compact ) is embedded in the verma module  @xmath46 ( or  @xmath47 ) .",
    "this embedding is realized by a singular vector  @xmath48   determined by a polynomial  @xmath49   in the universal enveloping algebra  @xmath50 ,  @xmath51   is the subalgebra of  @xmath32 generated by the negative root generators @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , @xcite ,  @xmath52 ( or  @xmath53 for gvms )",
    ". then there exists @xcite an ^m _  :   _ (  )   _ (  - m ) given explicitly by : ^m _  =   ^m _ ( ) where  @xmath54   denotes the @xmath55 action on the functions  @xmath56 , cf . .",
    "let  @xmath57 .",
    "this algebra has discrete series representations and highest / lowest weight representations since the maximal compact subalgebra is  @xmath58 .",
    "we choose a  _ maximal _ parabolic  @xmath59   such that  @xmath60 ,  @xmath61 .",
    "we note also that  @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the factor  @xmath37   has the same finite - dimensional ( nonunitary ) representations as the finite - dimensional ( unitary ) representations of the semi - simple subalgebra of  @xmath63 .",
    "we label the signature of the ers of @xmath30 as follows :  =   \\ { n_1 , n_2 , n_4 , n_5 ; c }  , n_j _ +  , c = d- where the last entry of  @xmath36   labels the characters of @xmath64 , and the first @xmath65 entries are labels of the finite - dimensional nonunitary irreps of @xmath37 when all @xmath66 or limits of the latter when some @xmath67 .    below we shall use the following conjugation on the finite - dimensional entries of the signature : ( n_1,n_2,n_4,n_5)^ *   ( n_4,n_5,n_1,n_2 )  .",
    "the ers in the multiplet are related also by intertwining integral operators introduced in @xcite .",
    "these operators are defined for any er , the general action being : & & g_ks  :   _    _  , & &  =   \\ { n_1,n_2,n_4,n_5 ; c }  ,   =   \\ { ( n_1,n_2,n_4,n_5)^ * ; -c } .    for the classification of the multiplets we shall need one more conjugation for the entries of the  @xmath37   representations : ( n_1,n_2,n_4,n_5)^   ( n_5,n_4,n_2,n_1 )  .    further ,",
    "we need the root system of the complexification  @xmath68  .",
    "the positive roots in terms of the simple roots are given standardly as : _",
    "ij  & = &   _ i + + _ j  , 1 i < j 5  , _ jj  & = &   _ j  , 1 j 5 from these the compact roots are those that form ( by restriction ) the root system of the semisimple part of  @xmath69 , the rest are noncompact , i.e. , &   _ ij  , 1 i 3  ,   3 j 5  .",
    "further , we give the correspondence between the signatures @xmath36 and the highest weight @xmath70 .",
    "the connection is through the dynkin labels : m_i   ( +,^_i )  =   ( + , _ i )  , i=1,  ,5 , where  @xmath35 ,  @xmath71 is half the sum of the positive roots of  @xmath32 .",
    "the explicit connection is : n_i = m_i  , c  =   - m _",
    "=   - ( m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + 2m_4 + m_5 )    we shall use also the so - called harish - chandra parameters : m_jk ( + , _ jk )  =   m_j + + m_k  ,  j < k  , m_jj m_j  .",
    "finally , we remind that according to @xcite the above considerations for  @xmath3   are applicable also for the algebra  @xmath72   with parabolic  @xmath37-factor  @xmath73 .",
    "there are two types of multiplets : main and reduced .",
    "the multiplets of the main type are in 1-to-1 correspondence with the finite - dimensional irreps of  @xmath3 , i.e. , they are labelled by the five positive dynkin labels  @xmath74 . in @xcite",
    "we have given explicitly the main multiplets for  @xmath75 , and the reduced for @xmath2 .",

    "- this represents the weyl symmetry realized by the knapp - stein operators :   @xmath79 .",
    "matters are arranged so that in every multiplet only the er with signature  @xmath80   contains a finite - dimensional nonunitary subrepresentation in a finite - dimensional subspace  @xmath81 .",

    "all the above is valid also for the algebra  @xmath72 , cf .",
    "however , the latter algebra does not have discrete series representations . on the other hand the algebra  @xmath3",

    "the direct sum of the holomorphic and the antiholomorphic representations is the invariant subspace  @xmath91   of the er  @xmath94 .",
    "note that the corresponding lowest weight gvm is infinitesimally equivalent only to the holomorphic discrete series , while the conjugate highest weight gvm is infinitesimally equivalent to the anti - holomorphic discrete series .    in fig .  1 and below we use the notation :  @xmath95",
    "each  is represented by an arrow accompanied by a symbol  @xmath96   encoding the root  @xmath97   and the number @xmath98 which is involved in the bgg criterion .",
    "this notation is used to save space , but it can be used due to the fact that only  which are non - composite are displayed , and that the data  @xmath99 , which is involved in the embedding  @xmath100   turns out to involve only the  @xmath101   corresponding to simple roots , i.e. , for each @xmath102 there exists  @xmath103 , such that  @xmath104 .",
