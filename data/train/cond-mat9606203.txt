    "the study of continuous spin models in low dimensions has been very useful either for the knowledge of some physical systems directly associated ( mainly in condensed matter ) , or as toy systems for studying relativistic field theories .",
    "the @xmath5 model in three dimensions has been conjectured to be on the same universality class as the finite - temperature chiral phase transition of qcd with massless flavors  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 universality class has also appeared in perturbation - theory studies of spin - systems for which the @xmath6 symmetry of the action is fully broken on the low temperature phase  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath6 model in two dimensions offers a play - ground to explore asymptotic freedom  @xcite , although there has been recently some controversy on this point  @xcite .",
    "regarding the applications to condensed matter physics , let us remind that the three - dimensional @xmath6 model is the low - temperature s effective - model for a bidimensional quantum antiferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "it also appears as a limiting case of a @xmath7-gauge lattice model for nematic phase transitions of liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath8 model in three dimensions is known to be in the same universality class as superfluid @xmath9he .",
    "the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma models in three dimensions have been extensively studied either with analytical  @xcite or numerical methods , obtaining very accurate results in the determination of the critical properties . in particular the critical exponents have been measured for @xmath10 with a precision greater than a 1%  @xcite . however , the finite - size effects have not been considered in a systematic way .",
    "we find this procedure not harmful for @xmath4 exponent measures , but quite dangerous for @xmath2 exponents determinations .",
    "another point we focus on , is the study of the second - rank tensorial magnetization .",
    "this composite operator is needed as an order - parameter in some applications , for instance when the usual magnetization vanishes , as in studies of nematics  @xcite .",
    "it is also the relevant order parameter for systems where the @xmath6 symmetry is fully broken  @xcite .",
    "naively one could expect that the tensorial magnetization scales just as the square of the vectorial one , that is , @xmath11 is twice @xmath12 , as a mean field calculation predicts ( it was also assumed in ref .",
    "nevertheless we shall show that this is not so . a somehow related question , which has aroused interest lately , is the presence of some pathologies in the renormalization of composite operators in @xmath13 expansions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 models , centering mainly in the measures of magnetic exponents using a finite - size scaling method which is specially useful for observables that change rapidly at the critical point .",
    "in addition to the standard magnetic exponents we measure those related with tensorial excitations . the critical couplings and @xmath4 exponents are also studied .",
    "we are specially interested in the measure of @xmath4 in the @xmath5 case in order to compare with the results obtained in the antiferromagnetic @xmath14 model  @xcite , which is related with @xmath5 when there is a total breakdown of its @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "we consider the usual hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a @xmath17 components normalized vector , and the sum is extended over first neighbor pairs .",
    "it is well known that this model undergoes a second order phase transition for which the normalized magnetization @xmath18 is an order parameter ( @xmath19 is the lattice volume ) . as this model",
    "can be simulated using cluster algorithms  @xcite , it is possible to thermalize very large lattices .",
    "we are also interested in studying the behavior of composite operators that could be related with bound states from a quantum field theory point of view",
    ". one can construct orthogonal states to that generated by the fundamental field , just ensuring that the composite operator transforms as a higher order irreducible representation .",
    "the simplest representation beyond the fundamental one is the second rank tensorial representation .",
    "the associated tensorial magnetization can be written as @xmath20    as it happens with the vectorial magnetization , the mean value of @xmath21 is zero in a finite lattice , so , in the monte carlo simulation we have to construct an estimator that avoids the tunneling effects .",
    "we define the ( normalized ) magnetizations as @xmath22    we also define the associated susceptibilities as @xmath23    the critical behavior of those quantities is expected to be    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the reduced temperature .",
    "we expect the tensorial exponents to be also related through the ( hyper ) scaling relation @xmath26 .",
    "to compute the critical exponents we have used a finite - size scaling analysis . specifically , we have used the method of refs .  @xcite that consists in the comparison of observables on several pairs of lattices at the same coupling . the mean value for the operator @xmath27 , measured in a length @xmath28 lattice , at a coupling @xmath12 in the critical region , is expected to behave as    @xmath29 , \\label{fss}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are smooth scaling functions for this operator , @xmath32 is a measure of the correlation length and @xmath33 is the critical exponent associated with @xmath27 .",
    "let us recall that @xmath34 is an universal exponent related with the first irrelevant operator .",
    "the dots stand for further scaling corrections .",
    "we have also dropped a @xmath35 term , negligible in the critical region . to eliminate the scaling functions we compare the measures in two different lattice sizes ( @xmath36 ) at the same coupling .",
    "let be @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to find the coupling value where @xmath39 .",
    "measuring @xmath27 at that point we obtain the critical exponent from @xmath40    we remark that even if @xmath27 is a fast varying function of the coupling in the critical region , as the magnetization , the statistical correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath42 allows a very precise determination of the exponent .",
    "for the correlation length , we use a second momentum definition  @xcite which is easy to measure and permits to obtain an accurate value : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is defined as the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function at minimal momentum ( @xmath45 and permutations ) .",
    "for the monte carlo simulation , we have used the wolff s embedding algorithm with a single cluster update  @xcite .",
    "we have simulated in lattice sizes from @xmath46 to @xmath47 on the critical coupling reported on refs .",
    "we have used the spectral density method to extrapolate to the neighborhood of these couplings .",
    "we have updated 25 million clusters for o(2 ) and o(3 ) and 50 million in the o(4 ) case .",
    "the autocorrelation times are very small in all cases ( not larger than a hundred of clusters ) .",
    "the runs have been performed on several workstations .",
    "we have used the operator @xmath48 to obtain the @xmath4 exponent ( @xmath49 ) . for the magnetic exponents , we use the total magnetization ( @xmath50 ) as well as the corresponding susceptibility ( @xmath51 ) . from them",
    "we obtain the @xmath2 exponent using the scaling relations @xmath52 . for the tensorial channel",
    "we obtain a different set of exponents that we denote as @xmath53 respectively .    in table",
    "[ ontab ] we report the results for the exponents displaying also the used operator .",
    "we have checked other observables as well as other definitions of the correlation length but , in all cases , either the corrections - to - scaling or the statistical errors are greater .",

    "let us remark that the conjectured value for the critical coupling of the @xmath6 model  @xcite , @xmath55 , is ten standard deviations away from our measures .",
    "to control finite - size effects the most common procedure is to pick the smaller lattice for which there is no scaling corrections .",
    "that is , one uses a log - log plot , discard small lattices , and stop when the value of critical index stabilizes . using this method",
    ", it has been determined that for the @xmath8 model it is enough to use lattices with sizes @xmath56  @xcite , @xmath57 for the @xmath6 model  @xcite , and @xmath58 for the @xmath5 model  @xcite .",
    "we shall confirm this assumption for the @xmath4 exponent but no for the magnetic ones .",
    "it might not be possible to find a _ safe _",
    "( in fact , to find scaling corrections is just a matter of statistical accuracy ) , we thus need an extrapolation procedure . with an @xmath34 estimation",
    ", we can extrapolate to the infinite volume limit , with an ansatz for the exponent @xmath33 :    @xmath60    the situation is fairly different for the @xmath4 and @xmath2 exponents , therefore we shall discuss them separately .      due to the high accuracy that we get from the statistical correlation between the measures of @xmath32 and @xmath61 , we are able to resolve finite - size corrections .",
    "one could wonder if only the first correction term ( @xmath62 ) is needed . to check it",
    "we have used an objective criterium : we perform the fit from @xmath59 , then we repeat it discarding @xmath59 and check if both fitted parameters ( slope and extrapolation ) are compatible .",
    "if that is the case , we take the central value from the fit with @xmath59 and the error bar from the fit without it . in the three models",
    ", we find that @xmath63 is enough for this purpose .    for the @xmath8 and @xmath6 models",
    ", we have a very precise knowledge of @xmath64 , from series analysis .",
    "we plot in figure  [ eta ] our data as a function of @xmath65 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the fit has @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath6 we obtain @xmath67 .",
    "we then find no reason to expect higher order corrections to be significant .",
    "we have also performed a simulation on a @xmath68 lattice , finding that , for the @xmath8 model , the corresponding @xmath2 value is one standard deviation away from the corresponding point in the fit performed for @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , it seems even reasonable to keep the error from the @xmath63 fit ( @xmath70 ) . for the @xmath6 model , the @xmath68 point is three standard deviations away from the fit for @xmath69 due to higher order corrections - to - scaling .",
    "notice in fig .",
    "[ nu ] that the slope for @xmath8 is significantly larger , which could mask higher order corrections .",
    "for the @xmath5 model , lacking a theoretical knowledge of @xmath34 , there are stronger uncertainties .",
    "we find the change from @xmath64 for @xmath8 and @xmath6 , to @xmath71 for @xmath5 very surprising ( see table  [ betatab ] ) .",
    "this might arise from an unexpected cancelation of first order scaling - corrections for the binder cumulant and the correlation length .",
    "we show in table  [ etaon ] the extrapolated values for @xmath2 exponents . for the @xmath5 model we present the extrapolation with @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) and with @xmath71 with @xmath74 .",
    "both values are hardly compatible .",
    "the determination of @xmath2 from @xmath61 and @xmath75 are of course coincident in all cases due to the strong statistical correlation between both observables .",
    "we find that the value for @xmath8 and @xmath6 are compatible with @xmath3-expansions and not too far from g - expansions , but incompatible with the previous monte carlo results  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath5 both @xmath2 values are significantly lower than for the other models which is not surprising because , in the large @xmath17 limit , this exponent should go to zero .",

    ". from table  [ ontab ] corrections - to - scaling are not self - evident . if one adopts this optimistic point of view and performs a mean of all values in the table one finds that only for @xmath56 , @xmath77 becomes acceptable .",
    "errors for the means are much smaller than for individual measures , and so , maybe smaller than scaling - corrections .",

    "the value of @xmath77 for @xmath5 and @xmath8 models is about @xmath78 . for the @xmath6 model",

    "indeed one would be tempted to claim that for the @xmath5 model , finite - size effects are beyond our resolution for @xmath58 , as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath6 model",
    "this also seems to be the case for @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "however the question is not so clear for the @xmath8 model .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental value is known to be @xmath86  @xcite , and we do find that for @xmath56 our @xmath4 estimation is consistent with it . if we actually believe that the corrections - to - scaling are negligible for @xmath87 , we can take the mean of the _ safe _ lattices , getting    @xmath88    error bars decrease strongly compared to the data in table  [ ontab ] , therefore it is not clear if scaling - corrections are still negligible .",
    "a more conservative point of view would ask for the consideration of these corrections . for this",
    "we use the ansatz  ( [ xw ] ) .",
    "however , from the plot in figure  [ nu ] , it seems clear that the scaling corrections for @xmath89 in the @xmath8 model , and @xmath46 in the @xmath6 model , could hardly be linear on @xmath65 . performing the fit suggested by equation  ( [ xw ] ) , with @xmath64 for @xmath8 and @xmath6  @xcite from the _",

    "therefore we consider two values of @xmath59 .",
