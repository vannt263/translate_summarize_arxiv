    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; law et al . 2009 ; rau et al .",
    "2009 ) is a synoptic survey designed to explore the transient sky .",
    "the project utilizes the @xmath6 samuel oschin schmidt telescope on mount palomar .",
    "the telescope has a digital camera equipped with 11 active ccds , each 2k@xmath74k pixels ( rahmer et al . 2008 ) .",
    "each ptf image covers 7.26deg@xmath8 with a pixel scale of @xmath9pix@xmath10 . from the beginning of the ptf survey in march 2009 until january 2011 ,",
    "most of the images were taken with the mould @xmath1 filter . starting january 2011",
    ", we performed the ptf main survey in @xmath2-band during dark time and in @xmath1-band during bright time .",
    "in addition , a few nights around times of full moon are used for taking images with narrow - band h@xmath11 filters . a ptf system overview and review of the first year",
    "s performance are given in law et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "accurate photometric calibration is a non - trivial task since one must know both the atmospheric transmission ( e.g. , padmanabhan et al .",
    "2008 ; burke et al . 2010 ) and the optical / detector system response as a function of wavelength , time , and sky position .",
    "moreover , observations of flux standards are required , and the true spectral energy distribution of these standards needs to be known . in practice simplifying assumptions are made in order to achieve solutions which are good to the few percent level .",
    "for example , in many cases , it is customary to use the calibrated magnitudes of the standard stars instead of their spectral energy distribution , and to assume that the atmospheric transmission is a smooth function of airmass .",
    "we note that relative - photometry approaches ( e.g. , gilliland & brown 1988 ; gilliland et al . 1991 ; honeycutt 1992 ; everett & howell 2001 ; ofek et al .",
    "2011a ) can achieve better accuracy from the ground , but are limited by scintillation noise ( e.g. , young 1967 ; gilliland & brown 1988 ) , poisson noise and flat - fielding errors .",
    "there are several approaches to photometric calibration .",
    "for example , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) images are calibrated using an auxiliary 20-inch telescope , which determines the photometric condition on a nightly basis ( hogg et al .",
    "this telescope measures the extinction and photometric zero point using a network of standard stars ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , which , in turn , are tied to the standard star bd@xmath12:@xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the photometric uniformity in the sdss is achieved by the algorithm described in padmanabhan et al .",
    "the sdss photometry is uniform to better than 2% in all bands",
    "( adelman - mccarthy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "ofek ( 2008 ; see also pickles & depagne 2010 ) has suggested using tycho-2 ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) stars to photometrically calibrate astronomical images . the sdss @xmath14 magnitudes of such stars are based on synthetic magnitudes of stellar spectral templates fitted with the hipparchos @xmath15 , @xmath16 magnitudes and the 2mass ( skrutskie et al . 2006 ) @xmath17 magnitudes .",
    "however , this strategy requires images containing unsaturated tycho calibration stars which lie in the @xmath18@xmath19 magnitude range .",
    "the saturation limit for the ptf @xmath2- and @xmath1-band survey is typically around 14 magnitude .",
    "herein , we describe the method we have developed for the photometric calibration of ptf data taken in the @xmath2 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "the photometric calibration of the ptf h@xmath11 survey will be described elsewhere .",
    "we note that the relative photometric calibration of ptf currently achieves precision as good as 3mmag , in given fields , at magnitude 15 ( e.g. , van eyken et al .",
    "2011 ; ageros et al . 2011 ; law et al . 2011",
    "; levitan et al . 2011 ; polishook et al . 2011 )",
    ". the ptf relative photometry pipeline will be described in levitan et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "our method of photometric calibration for ptf data is similar to the `` classical '' method of observing a small number of calibration stars ( e.g. , landolt 1992 ) through various airmasses and assuming photometric conditions ",
    "i.e. , the atmosphere transmission properties are constant in time and are a continuous function of airmass .",
    "the main difference is that we are using sdss stars as standard stars and we typically observe @xmath20 sdss stars with high s / n in each ccd per night .",
    "another important difference is that ptf observations are done in a single filter each night .",
    "therefore , in order to relate the ptf calibrated magnitudes to one of the common absolute systems one need to apply color terms . the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ process ] , we describe the ptf photometric - calibration method . in  [ illum ] , we discuss the illumination correction , while  [ fog ] describes a related problem that plagues early ptf data . in  [ data ] we describe the data products and what calibration information is stored with the image - product data .",
    "the performance of the ptf magnitude calibration is given in ",
    "[ perf ] , and the derived photometric parameter statistics are discussed in  [ pars ] .",
    "we provide the color transformation between the ptf magnitude system and other systems in ",
    "[ color ] .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in  [ sum ] . unless specified otherwise , the statistics given here are based on all ptf data obtained from march 2009 to july 2011 .",
    "ptf has two main data - reduction pipelines .",
    "the first is for real - time ( @xmath21min ; e.g. , gal - yam et al . 2011 ) image subtraction and transient detection , hosted by the lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( nugent et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "this paper will make no further mention of this pipeline , as only the second pipeline is relevant here , as discussed below .",
    "the photometric calibration described in this paper is implemented in the second pipeline .",
    "this pipeline , hosted by the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) , performs final image reduction and extracts the source catalogs .",
    "the processing includes splitting the multi - extension fits images , de - biasing , flat fielding , astrometric calibration , generation of mask images , source extraction and photometric calibration ( the subject of this paper ) .",
    "this pipeline is described in grillmair et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and laher et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "our photometric - calibration process runs on ptf data separately for each night , filter and ccd .",
    "it first attempts to match the sources extracted from the ptf images taken during a given night with sdss - dr7 photoprimary point sources ( i.e. , sdss type@xmath22 ) . in order to assure good photometric quality ,",
    "only sdss stellar objects with photometric errors smaller than 0.05mag in @xmath23- and @xmath24-bands and which are fainter than 15 mag ( to avoid saturated stars ) in the @xmath2- , @xmath23- and @xmath24-bands are used .",
    "the photometric solutions are calculated only if more than 30 science images were taken during the night , and only if we were able to select more than 1000 sdss stars in all the images taken with a given ccd and filter during the entire night .",
    "we use the sdss - matched stars as a set of standard stars and solve for the photometric zero points , airmass terms and color terms in a given night .",
    "the fitting process is done separately for each one of the 11 active ccds and the @xmath2- and @xmath1-band filters .",
    "this is required since the ccds are not identical and some of them have a different spectral response ( see law et al .",
    "2009 for details ) . for observations taken using",
    "the @xmath1-band filter is similar in shape to the sdss @xmath23-band filter , but shifted 27  redward . ]",
    "filter we fit the following model : @xmath25 while for @xmath2-band observations we fit : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the ptf instrumental magnitudes in band @xmath28 ( either @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) , @xmath29 is the sdss magnitude in band @xmath28 ( either @xmath2 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) , @xmath30 is the photometric zero point for filter @xmath28 , @xmath31 is the color term for filter @xmath28 , @xmath32 is the extinction coefficient ( airmass term ) for filter @xmath28 , @xmath33 is the airmass - color term for filter @xmath28 , @xmath34 is the airmass , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the polynomial coefficients for the change in the zero point of filter @xmath28 as a function of time , @xmath37 in days , during the night , where @xmath38 in days is the middle of the night , and @xmath39 is the exposure time in seconds .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes used in the photometric calibration process are based on the sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) mag_auto magnitude and @xmath40 . ]",
    "( see also  [ acc ] ) , with an internal sextractor zero point of 0 .",
    "the above set of equations are solved using linear least - squares fitting .",
    "the errors in @xmath41 are taken as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the sdss magnitude error , @xmath44 is the ptf magnitude errors and @xmath45 is the assumed internal accuracy of the sdss photometric calibration ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "the fit is performed iteratively , up to 3 times , with sigma clipping of 3@xmath46 .",
    "the sigma clipping ensures removal of stars with bad photometry ( e.g. , influenced by cosmic rays ; saturated pixels ) .",
    "next , in order to be able to correct for zero - point variations across a given ccd ( see  [ illum ] ) , the residuals from the best fit of equations  [ zpeq_r ] or [ zpeq_g ] are binned in cells of @xmath47pix@xmath8 along the x and y dimensions of each ccd . in each cell , we take the mean of the residuals and subtract from it the mean of the residuals in the center - of - image cell , @xmath48 . ] , in order to render the residuals relative to the residual at the image center . the resulting coarse image of the mean of the residuals is linearly interpolated to generate an image at the resolution of ptf images of pixel - to - pixel zero point variations .",
    "this image product is equivalent to an illumination correction , and herein also called the zero point variation map ( zpvm ; see  [ illum ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the zpvm is estimated by calculating the standard deviation ( std ) of the residuals in each cell .",
    "we note that the ptf illumination correction images are usually smooth on large scales ( comparable with the ccd image size ) .",
    "therefore , in most cases the zpvm can be represented by low - order polynomials . in order to provide users with a simpler version of the illumination correction",
    ", we also fit versions of equations  [ zpeq_r ] and [ zpeq_g ] that consists of a low - order - polynomial representation of the zpvm , e.g. , for the @xmath1-band : @xmath49^{2 }          \\cr                   &     + \\alpha_{{\\rm y3},r}[(y-\\frac{1}{2}y_{{\\rm size}})/y_{{\\rm size}}]^{3 }          \\cr                   &     + \\alpha_{{\\rm xy},r}(x-\\frac{1}{2}x_{{\\rm size}})(y-\\frac{1}{2}y_{{\\rm size}})/(x_{{\\rm size } } y_{{\\rm size } } ) , \\label{zpeqxy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the positions on the ccd , @xmath52 is the size of the ccd , in pixels , in the @xmath50 dimension ( 2048pix ) and @xmath53 corresponds to the @xmath51 dimension ( 4096pix ) .",
    "a similar equation is fitted for the @xmath2-band observations ( see equation  [ zpeq_g ] for analogy ) . here , the illumination correction is represented by polynomials with coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "this representation usually provides a good estimate of the illumination correction over the image .",
    "we note that for each solution we store a variety of information regarding the quality of the fit ( see  [ data ] ) .",
    "the zpvm and its polynomial representation amount to an illumination correction that describes the variations in the photometric zero point spatially across the image ( e.g. , regnault et al .",
    "naively , such zero - point variations should be removed by the flat - fielding process . however , for example , if the fraction of flux in the stars point spread function ( psf ) wings , relative to the flux integrated to infinity in the psf , is variable as a function of position on the ccd then this may induce variations that are not removed by the flat - fielding process .",
    "such ccd position - dependent variations are indeed detected in ptf images ( e.g. ,  [ fog ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : zpvm_example ] presents two examples of illumination correction images .",
    "the left panel shows a typical case , in which the illumination corrections have a low range variations .",
    "the right panel shows one of the worst cases we encountered thus far , with larger amplitude variations ( see  [ fog ] ) .",
    "we note that the median peak - to - peak variations in the zero point across the image over all photometric nights , filters and ccds is about 0.06mag .     and the @xmath1-band filter .",
    "_ right panel : _ one of the worst examples with peak - to - peak range of 0.22mag in the zero point across the image .",
    "this zpvm image was constructed based on data obtained on 2010 may 7 with ccdid@xmath59 and the @xmath1-band filter . in such bad cases",
    "the polynomial representation may deliver poor quality results .",
    "we note that this bad example is not representative of ptf data and that typical images obtained using this system have good image quality .",
    "[ fig : zpvm_example],width=321 ]    in the first year of the ptf project following first light , we detected a problem with the ptf image quality .",
    "this issue is referred to as the fogging problem , and it manifested itself as a diffuse halo around bright stars and a prominent large scale non - uniformity in the illumination corrections . the fogging problem and our testing and subsequent apparatus modifications for ameliorating its effects",
    "are described in  [ fog ] .",
    "the ptf camera window , which also acts as a field flattener , is fairly large ( @xmath60cm@xmath8 ) .",
    "the window surface temperature is @xmath62@xmath63c below the ambient temperature . to prevent condensation from forming on the window ,",
    "a constant stream of dry air or nitrogen is blown across the window s outer surface . in the original installation of the camera ,",
    "new nylon tubing was used to convey the gas to the window .",
    "this tubing was selected for its reported high durability , flexibility and low outgassing properties .",
    "once the window fogging problem was discovered , a test chamber was assembled , which simulated the cold window environment in which dry nitrogen could be conveyed across a cold test surface .",
    "the outgassing properties of various tubing materials were evaluated in the test chamber .",
    "the nylon tubing used in the original camera installation was found to have a moderate amount of outgassing which produced volatiles that would condense on the cold test surface .",
    "tubing made from teflon fep ( fluorinated ethylene propylene ) was found to have low outgassing with no detectable volatile condensation on the cold test surface .",
    "the camera window was cleaned and all tubing between the dry nitrogen supply and the camera window was replaced with this material on 2010 september 2 .",
    "no window fogging issues have been observed since the tubing material was replaced .",
    "we note that the camera window was cleaned several times during ptf operations , and after each cleaning an immediate reduction in zpvm deviations from zero is expected .",

    "we need to multiply , pixel by pixel , the processed image by @xmath93 , where zpvm is the illumination correction image .",

    "the accuracy of our calibration process , relative to sdss , is discussed in  [ acc ] , while in  [ rep ] , we discuss the repeatability of our photometric calibration .      as described in  [ use ] , the ptf calibrated magnitudes can be given in two systems . a color - corrected magnitude system , denoted by @xmath94 or @xmath95 , in which the known color of the object is applied to equations  [ zpeq_r][zpeq_g ] or [ zpeqxy ] . by construction , this magnitude system is similar to the sdss system .",

    "the scatter in the uncorrected color plot is larger , as expected .",
    "the larger scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig : coloruncorr ] is due to the fact that different stars in the field of view have different colors .",

    "this is due to the use of mag_auto .",
    "indeed , using aperture magnitude ( i.e. , mag_aper ) , we do  not see any evidence for this bias .",
    "this is because mag_auto adjusts the aperture used to extract the source magnitude for each object .",
    "therefore , if mag_auto is used for sources near the survey detection limit it is recommended to estimate the aperture correction for these sources in order to obtain their unbiased magnitudes .",
    "we note that the mag_auto is different from aperture or psf magnitudes . in order to convert between mag_auto and other kinds of magnitude estimators",

    "this figure shows the scatter in the calibrated magnitude of each star , over multiple epochs , as a function of magnitude .",
    "the scatter is calculated using the 68th percentile range divided by two ( i.e. , equivalent to std in case of a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "this is based on 27 images of ptf field 100037 ccdid@xmath99 taken between march and october 2010 , which have photometric calibration bright - star root - mean squares ( rms ) value ( parameter apbsrms in table  [ tab : header ] ) of less than 0.04mag .",
    "we choose to use the 68th percentile range instead of std since it is more robust to outliers .",
    "for example , if a night was `` photometric '' for 90% of the time ( e.g. , clouds entered only toward the end of the night ) , then our pipeline might claim that the night was photometric , but the calibration of some of the data will be poor .",
