    "qds are unique engineered small conductive regions in the semiconductor with a variable number of strongly interacting electrons which occupy well - defined discrete quantum states , for this reason they are referred to as `` artificial '' atoms @xcite,@xcite .",
    "several coupled qds form an `` artificial '' molecule @xcite,@xcite and can be applied for electronic devices creation dealing with quantum kinetics of individual localized states @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "that s why the behavior of coupled qds systems in different configurations is under careful experimental @xcite,@xcite and theoretical investigation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally that coupled qds can vary from the weak tunneling regime ( coupling with the leads is smaller than interaction between the qds ) to the strong tunneling regime ( interaction with the leads exceeds the qds coupling ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one of the most perspective technological goals of qds integration in a little quantum circuits deals with careful analysis of non - equilibrium charge distribution , relaxation processes and non - stationary effects influence on the electron transport through the system of qds @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "electron transport in such systems is governed by coulomb interaction between localized electrons and of course by the ratio between the tunneling transfer amplitudes and the qds coupling .",
    "correct interpretation of quantum effects in nanoscale systems gives an opportunity to create high speed electronic and logic devices @xcite,@xcite .",
    "so the problem of charge relaxation due to the tunneling processes between qds coupled with the continuous spectrum states in the presence or absence of coulomb interaction is really vital .",
    "time evolution of charge states in a semiconductor double quantum well in the presence of coulomb interaction was experimentally investigated in @xcite .",
    "authors manipulated the localized charge by the initial pulses and observed pulse - induced tunneling electrons oscillations which were fitted well by an exponential decay of the cosine function and a linearly decreasing term .",
    "time dependence of the accumulated charge and the tunneling current through the single and coupled quantum wells in the absence of the coulomb interaction were theoretically analyzed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but the authors took into account only two time scales which determine charge relaxation and neglected the third time scale which is responsible for charge redistribution between different quantum wells .",
    "in this paper we consider charge relaxation in a single qd and double qds due to the coupling with the continuous spectrum states . in the case of two coupled qds tunneling to the continuum",
    "is possible only from one of the qds .",
    "we have found that on - site coulomb repulsion even in one of the dots results in significant changing of the localized charge relaxation and leads to formation of several time ranges with strongly different values of the relaxation rates .",
    "we pointed out that the leading mechanism of non - monotonic charge relaxation is charge redistribution between the relaxation channels in one of the qds due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "first of all let us consider qd coupled to an electronic reservoir ( conduction electrons states have energies @xmath0 ) .",
    "we assume that the single particle level spacing in the dot is larger than all other energy scales , so that only one , spin - degenerate level of the qd spectrum is accessible @xmath1 .",
    "such a system can be described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a tunneling amplitude between the qd and the continuous spectrum states which we assume to be independent of momentum and spin . @xmath4 and @xmath5- electron creation / annihilation operators in the qd localized state and in the continuous spectrum states ( @xmath6 ) correspondingly .",

    "when the continuous spectrum electrons have fermi distribution function , charge density relaxation law strongly differs from the exponential law , especially when condition @xmath24 is valid ( solid line in fig.[figure1a_1c ] ) .",
    "this difference can be seen even when @xmath25 if condition @xmath26 occurs .",

    "the simple estimation of this time scale @xmath110 is connected with the inverse width of kondo peak .",
    "@xmath111    consequently relative values of the system parameters @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 determine it s behaviour .",
    "our investigations deals with the typical parameters values demonstrated below on fig.[figure4a_4b]-fig.[figure5a_5b ] . for these values of parameters",
    "@xmath116 , so @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the localized charge relaxation time in the second qd due to the interaction with continuous spectrum .",
    "more careful @xmath110 estimation can be based on the approach suggested in @xcite .",
    "we can consider energy level @xmath29 position changing due to the effect of coulomb interaction @xmath119 to be similar to the influence of time dependent gate voltage on the electron energies in qds leading to the spin flip .",
    "so following the logic of glazman et .",
    "@xcite one can obtain :    @xmath120    for typical values of system parameters ( fig.[figure4a_4b]-fig.[figure5a_5b ] ) @xmath121 .",
    "thus characteristic time of kondo peak formation is much larger than the localized charge relaxation time .",
    "we start by discussing the case of weak coulomb interaction when the ratio @xmath122 is fulfilled ( fig.[figure4a_4b ] ) .",
    "if the initial detuning between energy levels has positive value ( @xmath123 fig.[figure3a_3b]a ) localized charge relaxation rate in the first qd and full charge density in the second qd increase ( fig.[figure4a_4b]a , b grey line ) in comparison with the case when coulomb interaction is absent ( fig.[figure4a_4b]a , b black line ) .",
    "relaxation rate increases due to the decreasing of initial detuning value @xmath124 caused by coulomb interaction ( fig.[figure3a_3b]a , fig.[figure_3 ] ) .",
    "fig.[figure_3 ] demonstrates the detuning time evolution and reveals that in the absence of coulomb interaction energy levels detuning has constant value ( fig.[figure_3 ] grey dashed line ) .",
    "the presence of on - site coulomb repulsion results in the smaller detuning values in the system except the initial time moment and time period when the system is quite empty and coulomb interaction can be neglected ( fig.[figure_3 ] grey line ) .    in the opposite case of negative initial energy levels detuning ( @xmath125 fig.[figure3a_3b]b ) even small values of coulomb interaction results in the effective",
    "increasing of energy levels spacing ( fig.[figure_3 ] black line ) .",
    "consequently , relaxation rate in the first qd and full charge density in the second qd decrease ( fig.[figure4a_4b]a dashed line ) in comparison with the case when coulomb interaction is absent ( fig.[figure4a_4b]b dashed line ) and detuning takes on constant value .",

    "the appropriate detuning behavior is presented on the fig.[figure_5 ] .",
    "one can find that the presence of strong on - site coulomb repulsion results in fast compensation of initial positive detuning .",
    "further time evolution leads to the formation of negative detuning between energy levels and it is clearly evident that the filling numbers maximum in the second qd corresponds to the maximum energy levels spacing .",
    "this time interval reveals charge relaxation with the typical rate very close to the @xmath95 .",
    "coulomb interaction increasing in this time interval results in the weak decreasing of relaxation rate in comparison with the case when coulomb correlations are neglected .",
    "the next time interval @xmath135 ( @xmath136-is an instant of time when the filling numbers in the first qd @xmath23 achieve minimum value @xmath137 ) reveals localized charge relaxation with the typical rate very close to the @xmath96 . filling numbers time evolution in the first and second qds simultaneously demonstrates dip s formation ( fig.[figure5a_5b]a , b ) which corresponds to the local minimum of the effective detuning ( fig.[figure_5 ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the influence of the following physical mechanism : charge redistribution between the qds by means of relaxation channel with the typical relaxation rate @xmath78 ( eq.[filling_numbers_1 ] ) in the presence of strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "charge redistribution strongly governs the system behavior in the second time interval due to the presence of significant real part of the relaxation rate @xmath78 which is proportional to the value @xmath138 ( fig.[figure6a_6c ] grey line ) . in the first time interval relaxation",
    "occurs regularly because real part of the relaxation rate @xmath78 is negligible or nearly absent due to the small values of filling numbers in the second qd .",
    "contribution from the charge redistribution mechanism becomes crucial only when filling numbers in the second qd reach maximum value .",
    "these effect self - consistently influence the charge dynamics in the proposed system by means of effective detuning changing .",
    "the third time interval demonstrates charge relaxation with the typical rate very close to the @xmath95 .",
    "this interval exists due to the decreasing of the filling numbers amplitude in the second qd .",
    "it leads to the increasing of the relaxation rate value in comparison with the previous time interval .",
    "the presence of on - site coulomb repulsion leads to the small detuning values in comparison with the second time interval due to the fact that the system is quite empty and coulomb interaction can be neglected ( fig.[figure_5 ] ) .",
    "consequently charge redistribution also can be omitted . therefore with the increasing of time the effective detuning aspire to the value without any coulomb correlations in the system .",

    "their behavior is just the same for the both qds ( fig.[figure6a_6c ] ) . in the absence of coulomb interaction second channel relaxation rate @xmath142",
    "always exceeds the first channel @xmath143 relaxation rate .",
    "this ratio between relaxation rates also takes place at the initial time moment in the presence of coulomb interaction .",
    "coulomb interaction results in the dip and peak formation in the second and first relaxation channels accordingly ( fig.[figure6a_6c]a , b ) .",

    "[ t ]     let us now focus on the preexponential factors ( relaxation channel s amplitudes ) time evolution in the presence of coulomb interaction .",
    "in the second qd preexponential factors time evolution is determined by the same law ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 expression [ p2 ] ) ( fig .",

    "one can easily reveal that charge redistribution between the relaxation channels in the same qd occurs . at the initial moment",
    "most part of the charge is concentrated in the first relaxation channel of the first qd and later localized charge redistributes to the second relaxation channel of the first qd .",
    "the following time increasing again demonstrates charge localization in the first relaxation channel of the first qd .",
    "charge in the second qd is equally distributed between both relaxation channels .",
    "charge relaxation in the presence of coulomb interaction in both quantum dots is determined by the charge density redistribution among different channels in the same qd and by the changing of relaxation rates of each channel .",
    "so due to coulomb interaction the leading mechanism of non - monotonic charge relaxation in each qd is charge redistribution between the channels in a separate qd at particular range of the system parameters .",
    "[ t ]     the last point of our discussion deals with comparison between results obtained for suggested model and more natural from experimental point of view situation when coulomb interaction is taken into account in both qds .",
    "fig.[figure8a_8b ] demonstrates localized charge time evolution for the both relaxation channels .",
    "grey line corresponds to the case when coulomb interaction exists only in the second qd and black - dashed line describes the situation when coulomb interaction is taken into account in the both qds .",
    "it is evident that coulomb interaction in the both qds results in more rapid compensation of energy levels detuning for @xmath148 and does nt lead to qualitative changes of the obtained results .",
    "so ( as it was mentioned above ) for simplicity it is sufficient to consider coulomb interaction only in one qd . in any case coulomb interaction",
    "effectively changes level spacing , which control the charge redistribution between the relaxation channels in a single qd as well as between two qds .",
    "[ t ]       we have analyzed time evolution of localized charge in the system of two interacting qds both in the absence and in the presence of coulomb interaction between localized electrons within a particular quantum dot . we have found that coulomb interaction modifies the relaxation rates and the character of localized charge time evolution . it was shown that several time ranges with considerably different relaxation rates arise in the system of two coupled qds .",
    "we demonstrated that the presence of coulomb interaction leads to strong charge redistribution between different relaxation channels in each qd . so we can conclude that non - monotonic behavior of charge density is not the result of charge redistribution between the qds but is determined by charge redistribution between the relaxation channels in a single qd .    in any real situation coulomb interaction is present in both qds .",
    "but for simplicity it is sufficient to consider coulomb interaction only in one qd since the main role of coulomb interaction is charge redistribution between the relaxation channels in a single qd as well as between qds due to modification of the detuning between energy levels in qds .",
