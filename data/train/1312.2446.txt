    "another area includes the formation of exotic `` molecules '' from a combination of matter and antimatter .",
    "more specifically , polyelectronic clusters have been experimentally verified such as ps  @xcite , ps@xmath7  @xcite , and ps@xmath8  @xcite . on the other hand",

    ", there has remained active theoretical interest in electron - positron clusters  @xcite .",
    "this interest remains partly due to the possibility of a bose - einstein condensate of ps  @xcite .",
    "a deeper understanding , however , requires the ability to study ever larger clusters .",
    "one could simply use ever increasingly available computational power , or find breakthroughs in improving older techniques .",
    "one such technique is the stochastic variational method using correlated gaussians , both the traditional approach  @xcite , and that carried out at fixed hyperradius  @xcite .",
    "the latter method involves a two - step process to diagonalize the full hamiltonian .",
    "first , after expressing the schrdinger equation using a single length , the hyperradius @xmath0 , and the remaining degrees of freedom as hyperangles using hyperspherical coordinates  @xcite , the hyperangular schrdinger equation is solved parametrically in @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to an infinite set of coupled `` born - oppenheimer '' potentials .",
    "second , the set of one - dimensional differential equations in @xmath0 is solved .",
    "once the fixed-@xmath0 hyperspherical potential curves and nonadiabatic couplings have been determined for any few - body system , it becomes relatively straightforward to compute complex scattering processes such as rearrangement and n - body recombination  @xcite .",
    "earlier studies involved 3- and 4-body systems with vanishing angular momentum @xmath3 and positive parity @xmath4  @xcite , and recent developments have extended the method to systems of finite angular momentum and different parities  @xcite .",
    "the present study further extends the correlated gaussian hyperspherical technique , developing a new approach for the calculation of matrix elements at fixed hyperradius .",
    "we find that the matrix elements of the noninteracting system in an even number of dimensions can be evaluated in closed analytical form .",
    "for odd dimensions , or for general interaction potentials in any dimension , the matrix elements reduce to a single numerical integration regardless of system size .",

    "this can be seen from the fact that each factor of @xmath66 is paired with the imaginary number @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the negative @xmath66-axis is the complex conjugate of the positive @xmath66-axis and the integration over all @xmath66-space is equivalent to taking twice the real part of the result .",

    "this agrees with the results for @xmath96 of ref .",
    "there is a simple physical interpretation here : in keeping the hyperradius @xmath0 fixed , one must convolve functions of the squared lengths of all jacobi vectors .",
    "unfortunately , eq .   is difficult to carry out for more than two jacobi vectors since after performing the first convolution analytically , one is left with the convolution of @xmath97 with a hypergeometric function .",
    "this can be carried out , but the result is a kamp de frier function , which is a generalization of the hypergeometric functions to two variables . if convolving yet one more function , then to our best knowledge there is no analytical result .",
    "if the number of dimensions @xmath2 is 2 , however , then eq .   reduces to a gaussian .",
