    "a large number of experiments have now convincingly demonstrated that active neutrinos , _",
    "i.e. _ left handed neutrinos which interact via w and z exchange , can change their flavor .",
    "more recently , kamland  @xcite is providing direct evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "the oscillation of three . ] active neutrinos describes the global neutrino data very well , see _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the fact that neutrinos oscillate implies that at least two of the mass eigenstates have a non - zero mass .",
    "most models to accommodate massive neutrinos introduce right handed neutrinos , _",
    "i.e. _ states which do not couple to w and z bosons .",
    "these right handed neutrinos can either directly provide a dirac mass term or they mediate the seesaw mechanism  @xcite . in the latter case , the right handed neutrino tends to be very heavy with @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the most general scenario there is a 6x6 mass matrix whose entries are essentially unknown . to obtain the physical neutrino masses at scales below the electroweak phase transition",
    "this mass matrix has to be diagonalized and its eigenvalues are the neutrino masses relevant for low energy observations .",
    "since the entries of the mass matrix are not known it can gives rise to any spectrum of eigenvalues and thus neutrino masses .",
    "the need to describe the oscillation of three active neutrinos implies that _ at least _",
    "three eigenvalues have to be of @xmath6 or less .",
    "however , there can be @xmath7 additional small eigenvalues corresponding to light neutrino states , which due to the z decay width bound would have to be sterile .",
    "thus , we conclude that sterile neutrinos are theoretically well motivated by the observation of neutrino mass .",
    "furthermore , we see that there can be one or more sterile neutrinos which are light enough to play a role in neutrino oscillations .",
    "note , that all these considerations are entirely independent of any experimental claims to have seen sterile neutrinos , like , for example , the one by lsnd  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore how well sterile neutrinos can be constrained by a dedicated oscillation experiment based on a low energy beta - beam facility . for other physics which can be studied using a low energy beta - beam , _",
    "e.g. _ see  @xcite .",
    "the proposed experiment is a disappearance experiment and will be sensitive to @xmath8 and can probe mixing angles as small as @xmath9 . the oscillation probability for our purposes is a two flavor @xmath10 oscillation and the survival probability of @xmath11 is given by    the most sensitive experiments in this mass range looking for the disappearance of @xmath11 have been the reactor neutrino experiments : bugey  @xcite and chooz  @xcite .",
    "the bugey bound is valid in the range @xmath12 and it can constrain @xmath13 below @xmath14 .",
    "the bound from chooz is @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the concept we propose here is based on using a pure @xmath11 beam from the beta decay of completely ionized radioactive ions circulating inside a storage ring .",
    "the lorentz boost @xmath17 of these ions will be chosen such that the resulting @xmath11 have an energy below the pion production threshold . in this case , the by far most likely reaction is inverse beta decay on free protons . in this experiment",
    "we have an accurate theoretical understanding of the neutrino flux , spectrum and cross section .",
    "the detector will be placed so close to the neutrino source that oscillation will happen _ within _ the detector itself .",
    "thus the different parts of the detector will effectively act as near and far detector .",
    "this allows the cancellation of most systematical errors in a similar fashion as in modern reactor neutrino experiments .      in  @xcite ,",
    "the idea of using beta decay of exotic nuclei to produce well defined neutrino beams was introduced .",
    "the basic observation is , that if a beta decaying nucleus is moving with a lorentz @xmath18 , the isotropic neutrino emission will be collimated into a beam .",
    "the isotope we consider here is @xmath19he , which beta decays with a half life of @xmath20 and has an end - point energy @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 ions are injected per second into the storage ring and the beta - beam complex operates for @xmath23 per calendar year and our experiment runs for a total of five years .",
    "we consider a magnetic field @xmath24 inside the storage ring . taking @xmath25 this yields magnetic radius @xmath26 for the @xmath27he@xmath28 ion .",
    "the useful fraction , @xmath29 , of decays then is given by the ratio of the length of the straight section , @xmath30 , to the overall circumference of the ring , @xmath31 . with @xmath32",
    ", we obtain @xmath33 .",
    "schematic of the detector and storage ring . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : set - up ] shows a schematic of the setup we consider . in this scheme",
    "we will have a cylindrical detector whose symmetry axis is aligned with the straight section of the storage ring .",
    "the free parameters are ( see figure  [ fig : set - up ] ) : the length of the straight section ( @xmath30 ) , the distance between the front end of the storage ring and the front end of the cylindrical detector ( @xmath34 ) , the radius ( @xmath35 ) and the length ( @xmath36 ) of the detector . in the following , we will derive a general expression for the neutrino event rate as a a function of these free parameters .     the un - oscillated event rate as a function of neutrino energy .",

    "we assume that the beam is perfectly collinear and has no transverse extension , whereas all other length scales are of order @xmath46 . ] .",

    "vice versa_. we tested the values @xmath63 .",
    "we studied variations in @xmath17 from @xmath64 .",
    "this range was chosen to stay below or close to the pion production threshold .",
    "we also changed the detector radius from @xmath65 .",
    "we found that within those options the configuration with @xmath25 , @xmath32 , @xmath66 and @xmath56 is optimal .    using these numbers ,",
    "figure  [ fig : oscillation ] shows the resulting ratio of oscillated to un - oscillated event rates for two different vales of @xmath67 as a function of the reconstructed @xmath58 .",
    "the blue line assumes that the neutrinos are all generated at in one point in the middle of the straight section . the red line fully accounts for all the geometry effects . clearly , for @xmath68 ( upper panel )",
    ", several oscillation periods can be resolved .",
    "a comparison between the amplitudes of those periods allows to cancel systematics to a large extent ( see also , figure  [ fig : sys ] ) . at @xmath69 ( lower panel ) only an average suppression can be observed and the sensitivity is entirely determined by the achievable systematic errors .",
    "the detector we envisage is essentially similar to the miniboone detector  @xcite , however with a cylindrical shape .",
    "the important background will all be beam based , since beam - off backgrounds will be well measured and cosmic ray events can be tagged with high efficiency as was done in similar near surface experiments  @xcite . the beam energy has been selected to be below threshold for pion production , therefore there are few channels available for neutrino interactions . only charged current quasi - elastic scattering on carbon and electron elastic scattering can mimic the signal of the inverse beta decay primary positron .",
    "these event types will experience the same disappearance rates due to oscillations , but the neutrino energy reconstructed under the inverse beta decay hypothesis would be systematically less than the true neutrino energy . at these energies",
    "the cross sections for these background interactions are smaller by at least an order of magnitude , so any effect they might have on the measured oscillation parameters , in particular @xmath13 would be at most 10% , and they can be accounted for and corrected .    to further reduce the impact of these beam based backgrounds , the detector should be optimized for the detection of inverse beta decay .",
    "typically this is done by tagging the primary positron with the free neutron capture in delayed coincidence with a mean lifetime of @xmath70 in undoped organic scintillator .",
    "however , observing the @xmath71 gamma ray from neutron capture on hydrogen can be a significant challenge in a detector tuned to see events in the 50 to @xmath72 range .",
    "additionally , the long delay time will put several beam bunches between the primary and secondary events and will therefore increase the probability of false tags .",
    "adding gadolinium to the scintillator would help somewhat by increasing the tag energy to @xmath73 and reducing the capture time to @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , even if the neutron tag was highly efficient , at least some of the quasi - elastic events on carbon will also have a correlated neutron capture tag .",
    "another possibility is to design the detector to be sensitive to the positron direction .",
    "we expect the elastic scattering events to be peaked in the very forward direction , while the quasi - elastic carbon events will have a much broader angular distribution .",
    "the angular distribution of the hydrogen inverse beta decay events will fall somewhere in between .",
    "sensitivity to the angular distribution can be achieved by reducing the scintillation light to a point where erenkov light can be distinguished .    to achieve an energy resolution of 10% or better over the 50 to @xmath72 range",
    "should be possible with a photo - cathode coverage of 10% if we assume approximately equal parts erenkov and scintillation light  @xcite .",
    "position and timing resolutions , needed to correlate events with beam bunches , should be achievable at the half meter and @xmath75 level . with a bunch spacing of @xmath76 or greater",
    ", this resolution would provide sufficient space between bunches to demonstrate the rejection of non - beam backgrounds . at this level of detector resulution the @xmath58 uncertainty is fully dominated by the unkown production point in the straight section of the decay ring .",

    "our default configuration is shown as red solid line in both panels .",
    "the setup proposed here improves on the existing limit for @xmath78 . in the range @xmath79",
    "the improvement is one order of magnitude or better .",
    "the upper panel shows how the sensitivity changes with varying the length of the straight section . a longer straight section ( dash - dotted line )",
    "implies a large fraction of useful decays and thus better statistics . at the same time",
    "the @xmath58 resolution is reduced . as a result",
    "the sensitivity extends to smaller mixing angles ( higher statistics ) but at smaller @xmath67 ( resolution ) .",
    "the analogous arguments holds also for a shorter straight section ( dashed line ) , which yields smaller statistics but better resolution .",
    "this improves sensitivity to @xmath80 .",
    "thus the length of the straight section can effectively be used to tune the experiment to the desired range of @xmath67 and it can be envisaged to have running periods with different straight section lengths within the same setup .",
    "the lower panel shows variations of the systematic error .",
    "again our default setup with systematic error of @xmath81 is shown as red , solid line .",
    "at very small value of systematic error of @xmath82 , the sensitivity ( dash - dotted blue line ) becomes essentially independent of @xmath67 , once the first oscillation maximum can be observed .",
    "note , that this very small value of systematic error of @xmath82 probably is not attainable in a real experiment . for more realistic values of systematic error in the range @xmath83 , the sensitivity limit does not change for @xmath84 , which is due to the cancellation of the normalization error between different oscillation maxima .",
    "this is also illustrated in figure  [ fig : oscillation ] .",

    "these are 99% cl limits ( 1 dof ) . in upper panel , we choose different values of detector mass in the range 0.25 to 2 kton .",

    "our default configuration is shown as red solid line in both panels .",
    "the upper panel shows how a variation of detector mass by a factor of 10 changes the sensitivity .",
    "remarkably , this change is quite small : the detector density and aspect ratio are fixed .",
    "thus with increasing detector mass , the additional detector mass will be exposed to a weaker neutrino flux for purely geometrical reasons .",
    "the lower panel shows the change of sensitivity for a changing beam luminosity and here the effect is quite pronounced as every additional ion contributes equally to improve the sensitivity .",
    "note , the our default beam luminosity of @xmath37 is based on existing technology and thus may be somewhat conservative .",
    "we have studied a near detector setup at a low-@xmath17 beta - beam facility for its ability to constrain the disappearance of electron anti - neutrinos for mass squared differences @xmath85 .",
    "the key point is , that for a suitably chosen geometry several oscillation maxima occur within the same detector and thus a disappearance measurement at the sub - percent level becomes possible without requiring a stringent control on systematic errors .",
    "we focused on using a beam from the decay of @xmath19he , which produces electron anti - neutrinos .",
    "this allows to use inverse beta decay as detection reaction and we can exploit the well defined relationship between the positron and neutrino energy .",
    "thus , we have a very clean sample of electron anti - neutrino events .",
    "we carefully optimized the geometry and beam energy and found that @xmath25 yields the best sensitivity while still having the bulk of neutrinos below the pion production threshold . in order to have sufficient resolution in @xmath58 we had to reduce the length of the straight section down to @xmath86 , which makes this setup unique .",
    "note , that this allows our experiment to run parasitically in a low energy beta - beam facility since we use only around 3% of all ions . for a conservative beam luminosity of @xmath37 and detector mass of @xmath57",
    "we obtain a sensitivity to @xmath87 ( 99% cl ) for @xmath85 .",
