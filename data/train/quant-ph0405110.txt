    "spin chains are gaining increasing attention as natural candidates of quantum channels  @xcite .",
    "an unknown quantum state can be prepared on one end of the chain and then transferred to the other end by simply employing the ability of the chain to propagate the state by means of its dynamical evolution .",
    "this procedure does not require any gating and therefore can be implemented without any need for a modulation of the couplings between the spins .",
    "especially this last aspect may be of importance for solid state quantum information .",
    "several aspects of quantum communication using spin chains have been already obtained starting from the original proposal by bose  @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of the transmitted state can be increased if the sender and the receiver can encode / decode the state using a finite number of spins  @xcite .",
    "even perfect transmission can be achieved if the exchange couplings of the chain are chosen appropriately  @xcite or if it possible to perform measurements on the quantum spins of the chains  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was recently shown that a phase covariant cloner can be realized using an unmodulated spin network  @xcite and that the spins chain approach to quantum communication seems to be realizable in solid state devices with present day technology  @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect which is emerging recently is the interconnection between quantum information and condensed matter theory  @xcite .",
    "examples are the study of non - local ( quantum ) correlations of spin systems in a variety of situations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) or reformulation of the density matrix renormalization group in the framework of quantum information theory  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we would like to further explore the use of concepts born in quantum information for the characterization of spin chains . here",
    "we propose to use the information capacities of quantum channels as a tool to characterize some aspects of dynamical correlations in a spin chain . by calculating the capacities of the channel , obtained by identifying two separate sections of the chain as the extremes of a communication line",
    ", one can in fact get some information about the strength of the correlations among the interconnecting spins .",
    "in some sense this is equivalent to assigning to any couple of subsets of the spins in the sample the values of the corresponding capacities in order to create a `` road map '' of the information fluxes in the system .",
    "our results apply for the whole class of hamiltonians for which the total magnetization along a fixed direction is conserved . in the present work we confine ourself to the case",
    "in which one bit is transferred through the chain .",
    "this situation corresponds to study the sectors in which only few spins are up .",
    "we believe , however that the present approach can be further extended to other spin sectors .",

    "[ s : cap ] ) instead we give a brief overview of channel capacities and , by studying the qubit amplitude damping channel  @xcite , we calculate the quantum capacity @xmath0 , the entanglement assisted capacity @xmath1 and the classical capacity @xmath2 of the spin chain models presented in sec . [",
    "s : uno ] . as explained in detail throughout the paper the above quantities are computed in communication scenarios where many `` copies '' of the spin system are available and `` not '' for those scenarios where the communicating parties make multiple uses of the `` same '' spin chain .",

    "[ s : tre ] with the conclusions .",
    "given a collection of @xmath3 spins coupled by means of a time - independent hamiltonian it is possible to define a quantum channel by identifying two set of spins of the sample ( say , sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) as two quantum registers .",
    "a first party ( the sender of the message ) encodes some information on @xmath4 and a second party ( the receiver ) tries to recover such information from @xmath5 some later time @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "formally , one assumes that the encoding procedure takes place by initially decoupling the spins @xmath4 from the remaining spins without disturbing them from their initial fiduciary state @xmath7 , preparing @xmath4 on some input message @xmath8 , and finally allowing @xmath8 and @xmath7 to interact for a given time @xmath6 through the hamiltonian of the system . at this point",
    "we consider the state @xmath9 of the spins @xmath5 , obtained from the spin chain state @xmath10 by tracing away all the the degrees of freedom of the system but those relative to @xmath5 .",
    "[ here @xmath11 is the unitary evolution of the system ] . the resulting completely positive , trace preserving ( cpt ) mapping @xmath12 \\label{mappa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 means trace over all the spins but @xmath5 , defines the quantum channel we are interested in .",
    "a caveat is in order .",
    "equation  ( [ mappa ] ) does not provide a proper description of any realistic scenario where the communicating parties keep on operating on their quantum registers over an extended period of time .",
    "in fact , after a first `` reading out '' of the signal from the spin chain at time @xmath6 , the state @xmath7 of the spins not belonging to @xmath4 will change , thus making eq .",
    "( [ mappa ] ) unable to describe the state of @xmath5 for later times . as a matter of fact , in our system",

    "@xcite ) .    having the previous observations in mind ,",
    "( [ mappa ] ) can still be used to provide a quite complete characterization of the correlations between the registers @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite used to quantify the correlations between the sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the chain is then to consider the fidelity associated with @xmath14 , by computing the average fidelity between the input states @xmath8 and their output counterparts @xmath9 . here",
    "we observe that a more detailed characterization of such correlations can be obtained by treating @xmath14 of eq .",
    "( [ mappa ] ) as the cpt map of a real memoryless channel .",
    "the correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath5 can then be analyzed by means of the information capacities @xcite associated with  @xmath14 .",
    "these quantities are related to the minimum `` amount of redundancy '' over multiple uses of the channel @xmath14 needed to achieve perfect message transmission , i.e. unitary fidelity : higher values of the capacities correspond to stronger correlations between input and output states .",
    "depending on the nature ( e.g. classical or quantum ) of the information propagating through the channel one can define different capacities of @xmath14 and each of them are obtained by maximizing over all possible coding and decoding strategies which act over multiple channel uses ( see sec .",
    "[ s : cap ] ) . from the discussion that follows eq .",
