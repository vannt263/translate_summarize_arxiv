    "in recent years , trapped ions interacting with laser beams @xcite have become an extremely interesting system for the investigation of fundamental physics . for instance , they have been used to generate nonclassical motional states @xcite , and have been proposed for applications such as quantum computation @xcite and precision spectroscopy @xcite .    despite the relative simplicity of this system , the full theoretical treatment of its dynamics is a nontrivial problem , as the laser - ion interaction is highly nonlinear . even in the simplest case where only a single ion is in the trap , one",
    "is usually forced to employ physically motivated approximations in order to find a solution .",
    "a well - known example is the _ lamb - dicke _",
    "approximation @xcite , in which the ion is considered to be confined within a region much smaller than the laser wavelength .",
    "many treatments also assume a _ weak coupling _ approximation , i.e. , a sufficiently weak laser - ion coupling constant . under these conditions",
    ", tuning the laser frequency to integer multiples of the trap frequency results in effective hamiltonians of the jaynes - cummings type @xcite , in which the centre - of - mass of the trapped ion plays the role of the field mode in cavity qed @xcite .",
    "recently , a new approach to this problem has been suggested @xcite , based on the application of a unitary transformation @xmath0 which linearises the total ion - laser hamiltonian . under this transformation",
    "the hamiltonian becomes _ exactly _ ( not effectively ! ) equivalent to the full jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) , including counter - rotating terms , together with an extra atomic driving term .",
    "remarkably , the ion - trap system is thus formally equivalent to an atom interacting with a single - mode quantised electromagnetic field .",
    "the existence of this correspondence is very useful , since it allows us to map interesting properties of each model onto their counterparts in the other .",
    "for example , we can make use of the well - known ` rotating - wave ' limit where the jcm is analytically , albeit approximately , soluble @xcite .",
    "using the map @xmath1 to translate this solution back into the ion - trap scenario has led to the identification of a new dynamically interesting regime for that system @xcite , where phenomena such as `` super - revivals '' in the ion - laser interaction can occur .",
    "the same solution has also led to a scheme for realising substantially faster logic gates for quantum information processing in a linear ion chain @xcite .    in the present note",
    ", we apply this line of reasoning to the problem of obtaining _ exact _ eigenstates of either system . to our best knowledge , this has never been achieved in the case of the ion - trap hamiltonian . in the case of the jcm ( with no extra driving ) , exact eigenstates have been derived for those combinations of system parameters at which level crossings occur in the spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a simple physical ansatz similar to the one in @xcite to derive a family of exact eigenstates for the ion - trap system ( again , these are valid only under certain combinations of system parameters ) . in the special case where the ion is driven on resonance ,",
    "these states correspond , via the mapping @xmath0 , to the ones found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in addition",
    ", we study the asymptotic limit of large lamb - dicke parameter @xmath2 in the ion - trap system , which under @xmath0 corresponds to a large coupling constant in the jcm .",
    "we obtain in this way a very simple explanation of the asymptotic forms of _ all _ eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this limit ( these have also been derived in @xcite using other methods ) .",
    "let us start then by recalling the equivalence between the ion - trap system and the jcm @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the ion - laser dipole interaction , with no approximations ( except the optical rotating - wave approximation @xcite ) can be written as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the displacement operator , @xmath5 is the harmonic trapping frequency , @xmath6 the laser - ion detuning , @xmath7 the ( real ) rabi frequency of the ion - laser coupling , @xmath8 the lamb - dicke parameter , and we have chosen units where @xmath9 . on the other hand , the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian with counter - rotating terms can be written as    @xmath10    although these two models appear to be physically and mathematically quite distinct , they are in fact exactly equivalent the easiest way to see this is by rewriting eq.([ion1 ] ) in a notation where operators acting on the internal ionic levels are represented explicitly in terms of their matrix elements :    @xmath11    consider now the unitary operator @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "it is possible to check after some algebra @xcite that : @xmath14 returning to the usual notation , we obtain @xmath15    comparing with eq .",
    "( [ jcm1 ] ) it can be seen that this is precisely the jaynes - cummings interaction , supplemented by two additional terms : the first corresponds to an extra static electric field interacting with the atomic dipole , and the second is just a constant energy shift .",
    "in particular , a purely jaynes - cummings form is recovered when @xmath16 , corresponding to a resonant laser - ion interaction in eq .",
    "( [ ion1 ] ) . of course ,",
    "the various parameters of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ jcm2 ] ) have different meanings than they do in eq .",
    "( [ ion1 ] ) : @xmath5 becomes the cavity field frequency @xmath17 , @xmath18 the atomic transition frequency @xmath19 , @xmath20 the coupling strength with the static field and @xmath8 the ratio between the jaynes - cummings rabi frequency @xmath21 and the cavity frequency @xmath17 . in what follows",
    "we shall refer to eq .",
    "( [ jcm2 ] ) as the ` jaynes - cummings picture ' of the ion - trap hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ ion1 ] ) .",
    "as noted above , this correspondence enables one to map interesting properties of each model onto the other . in this paper",
    ", we will use it to translate between corresponding eigenstates of each system ( it is clear that , if @xmath22 is an eigenstate of @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a corresponding one for @xmath25 ) . in this regard",
    "it is important to point out that , although @xmath23 and @xmath25 both describe systems consisting of a two - level atom interacting with a bosonic mode , one should not identify each of these subsystems with their counterparts after the transformation has been applied .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath26 is an _ entangling _ transformation : separable internal - motional states of the trapped ion can be mapped into entangled atom - cavity states in the corresponding cavity qed system .",
    "in order to demonstrate the convenience of this correspondence , let us consider what happens to the systems above in the ` asymptotic ' limit where @xmath27 ( this problem has been studied in @xcite in the special case @xmath28 , using different methods ) . in the ion - trap picture , this limit corresponds to having a very large atomic recoil after the absorption of a photon from the laser ; in the jcm picture , to having a very large atom - mode coupling constant .",
    "from the point of view of current ion - trap and cavity qed experiments , neither of these conditions can be considered realistic .",
    "nevertheless , it may well be possible to engineer such a situation artificially , for example an ` effective ' jcm with large ` coupling constant ' can be obtained when a single ion is simultaneously illuminated with weak lasers tuned to the first red and blue sidebands @xcite .",
    "it is simpler to consider the problem first in the jcm picture . if @xmath27 , then the term containing @xmath29 in eq . ( [ jcm2 ] ) makes a negligible contribution to the total energy .",
    "we can therefore expect that the asymptotic eigenvalues and eigenvectors will not be affected if this term is in fact absent .",
    "setting @xmath30 implies that @xmath31 becomes a constant of the motion , so the asymptotic eigenstates can be chosen to be of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . in order to determine their form explicitly , and also their corresponding eigenvalues , let us switch back to the ion - trap picture . setting @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ ion1 ] ) reduces the hamiltonian to that of an _ uncoupled _ spin - boson system .",
    "the asymptotic eigenstates of the ion - trap are therefore simply @xmath34 . transforming back to the jcm picture using eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , we obtain thus @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a displaced number state @xcite ( note that they are independent of @xmath37 ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "note in particular that , when @xmath39 for integer @xmath40 , all but @xmath40 of these energy levels are degenerate . in the special case",
    "@xmath28 it can in fact be shown from symmetry considerations alone that the entire asymptotic spectrum must be two - fold degenerate @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , no such asymptotic degeneracies occur for @xmath41 .",
    "let us return now to the ion - trap hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ ion1 ] ) .",
    "we will construct an _",
    "ansatz _ which allows the determination of exact eigenstates of this system , provided certain relations are satisfied between the parameters @xmath42 .",
    "consider the possibility of finding an eigenstate of the form    @xmath43    let us see whether the eigenvalue equation @xmath44 can be satisfied .",
    "( [ ion2 ] ) shows that this requires @xmath45 to be of the form @xmath46 we thus require @xmath47    now , using the simple fact that @xmath48 @xcite , it is easy to show that displaced number states satisfy the recursion relation @xmath49 substituting then eqs .",
    "( [ ansatz1 ] ) , ( [ eigveq1 ] ) and ( [ dispeq1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eigveq ] ) and using the fact that @xmath50 is an orthonormal basis gives the following eigenstate conditions : @xmath51 where the @xmath52 coefficients satisfy @xmath53 and @xmath54 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } d_{0 } \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\vdots   \\\\ \\\\ d_{m } \\end{array } \\right ] = \\vec{0}\\ ] ] where @xmath55    using operator @xmath0 we can map this state into a corresponding eigenstate of the generalised jcm model in eq .",
    "( [ jcm2 ] ) @xmath56 once again we verify that the solution for this system can be easily expressed in terms of a displaced number state basis .",
    "further solutions can also be found if we note that the hamiltonian @xmath57 is invariant under the combined transformations @xmath58 defining then @xmath59 and applying this symmetry transformation to eqs .",
    "( [ eigveq1])- ( [ eps+ ] ) we can see that @xmath60 is also an eigenstate of @xmath23 , with eigenvalue @xmath61 , as long as @xmath62 where the @xmath63 coefficients satisfy an equation analogous to eq.([cond1a ] ) but with @xmath64    condition ( [ cond1a ] ) means that each of these anstze succeeds only for certain combinations of @xmath65 .",
    "this is because the tridiagonal matrix above ( which we will refer to as @xmath66 ) must have a zero eigenvalue , or equivalently @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 is a polynomial of degree @xmath69 in @xmath70 , @xmath37 or @xmath71 , fixing two of these quantities determines up to @xmath69 real solutions for the third one .",
    "for @xmath72 it is possible to solve this ` compatibility ' condition algebraically , resulting in explicit expressions in terms of any of the three parameters .",
    "for example , in terms of @xmath2 , the first few solutions are @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 according to which ansatz we are referring to .",
    "for @xmath77 a numerical solution is necessary .",
    "the physical meaning of these solutions can be clarified by examining the spectrum of @xmath23 , obtained by numerically diagonalising this operator ( or , equivalently , @xmath78 ) .",
    "let us first examine the case where @xmath79 ( previously studied in @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "( [ jcm]a ) we plot the first few energy levels as functions of @xmath2 , for the case where @xmath80 ( corresponding to a resonant jcm with no extra driving in eq.([jcm2 ] ) ) .",
    "it can be readily seen that pairs of adjacent energy levels form braids around the lines @xmath81 for integer @xmath82 , converging to these lines in the limit of large @xmath2 ( as expected from our considerations in section [ sec : asympt ] ) .",
    "the level crossings occur precisely on top of these lines , and there are @xmath82 such degeneracy points on the line @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "( in fact , it can be shown @xcite that these are the _ only _ energy values at which degeneracies may occur in this system ) .",
    "note now that , when @xmath28 equations ( [ eps+ ] ) and ( [ eps- ] ) coincide , and thus , @xmath83 are simultaneous ( in fact , _ degenerate _ ) eigenstates for any combination of @xmath84 at which @xmath85 . another way of understanding this fact is to note that the ion - trap hamiltonian @xmath23 has in this case an extra symmetry : it commutes with the parity - like observable @xmath86 ( in the jcm picture , the corresponding symmetry operator is @xmath87 ) .",
    "it can be easily checked that neither @xmath88 nor @xmath89 have this symmetry , but simple linear combinations of them do .",
    "every solution to the equation @xmath67 must therefore correspond to one of the level crossing points ; in other words , the location of these points can be calculated directly from this condition ( for @xmath77 this can not be done algebraically , of course ) .",
    "in fact , it turns out that , when @xmath90 , this equation always has @xmath82 real and positive solutions for @xmath2 @xcite , and so _ every _ crossing point in fig .",
    "[ jcm]a is accounted for in this way .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of what happens as the value of @xmath29 is changed ) .    for more general values of @xmath37",
    "the situation changes as follows ( fig [ jcm]b , c ) : whenever @xmath91 where @xmath40 is a nonzero integer ( i.e. , the laser is tuned to a sideband transition ) , it is easy to see that @xmath92 .",
    "in other words @xmath93 and @xmath94 are again degenerate eigenstates , and again the degenerate energies coincide with the asymptotic values for large @xmath2 ( recall sec . [",
    "sec : asympt ] ) .",
    "in fact , it can be verified that @xmath95 , so that both eigenstates occur for the same system parameters , thus corresponding once again to line crossings in the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ jcm]b ) .",
    "( for low values of @xmath96 this can be shown explicitly , for higher values one can again resort to numerical methods ) .",
    "it seems likely that this coincidence may once again be due to an underlying symmetry , however in this case we have not been able to determine it .",
    "finally , when @xmath37 is not an integer , the crossings in the spectrum become avoided crossings ( fig . [",
    "jcm]c ) , and in fact it is easy to show , using a method analogous to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , that _",
    "no _ degeneracies can occur in the system . in this case , the solutions obtained above simply mark ( some of ) the points where the spectrum crosses its asymptotic value ( fig .",
    "[ jcm]c ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that in certain circumstances it is possible to obtain exact eigenstates for the hamiltonian of a single trapped ion .",
    "these states are often ( but not always ) connected with the existence of level crossings in the system s energy spectrum viewed as a function of the lamb - dicke parameter .",
    "another property is that they are always expressible as a finite expansion in terms of certain physically well - motivated vibrational states ( number states and displaced number states ) . in this regard ,",
    "it is worth recalling a long - standing conjecture concerning a possible _ complete _ solution to the jcm in terms of known functions ( valid for any values of the system parameters ) .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the eigenstates of this system may always be expressible as a finite expansion in terms of a certain basis set , which in bargmann representation corresponds to a particular class of transcendental functions .",
    "as far as we know this proposal has never been analytically verified , although numerically it seems to hold @xcite . in the light of our present results , it is natural to speculate that this result should still hold in the presence of an additional static field , and thus should also apply to the single - ion system .",
