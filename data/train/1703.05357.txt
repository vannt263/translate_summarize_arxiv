    "the process of extraction or unpacking of an object which has an effective one - dimensional topology is very common in nature , including the dna molecule that is ejected from virus capsids  @xcite and the extraction of catheters in surgical interventions  @xcite up to the unwinding of wires in industry , and the unpacking of polymers and long - chain biomolecules in drug delivery  @xcite .",
    "the initial conformation of such one - dimensional objects confined in a finite volume present some analogies with the patterns found in the packing or in the crumpling of a long piece of wire  @xcite .",
    "the systematic study of crumpling processes began more than two decades ago with crumpled surfaces obtained from sheets of paper and aluminium foils submitted to rapid and ill - defined deformations typical of haphazard procedures aiming to confine them into small volumes  @xcite .",
    "the packing of dna in viral capsids has in recent years been associated with two - dimensional packing of wires , which presents the same fractal dimension  @xcite .",
    "the research of crumpled wires in two dimensions , on the other hand , began in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "when one injects , for instance , a long wire of copper into a two - dimensional cavity that allows only a single layer of wire , inner structures of iterated loops are formed with a pattern of points of contacts generating jammed structures as those observed the classical problem of packing of discs  @xcite .",
    "the general two - dimensional pattern associated with the packing of a long piece of wire presents some morphological phases  @xcite which are related with physical properties of the structure .",
    "recently , crumpled wires have been studied in connection with striking analogies with other different systems such as the electron gas at finite temperatures  @xcite , and two - dimensional quantum gravity  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the _ unpacking _ of a crumpled wire from two - dimensional cavities . in this case , when the wire is extracted with the aid of a dynamometer it is possible to record the force involved in the extraction and relate it with both the size of the loop which is released and the extracted length of the wire .",
    "a profile for the force is of great interest as indicated in several previous studies  @xcite , but we did not find in the literature any paper concerning processes of unpacking of wires from two - dimensional cavities . in spite of the introduction of some level of irreversibility in the packing of wire in a cavity as a consequence of high values of deformation and due to the effects of plasticity ever present , important results are achieved .",
    "basically we found that the force needed to extract the wire has a power law dependence with the size of the loops which it is better explained by the global features of the system .",
    "we also observed that the size of the loops decreases exponentially with its order of unpacking , allowing us to propose a differential equation for the ( un)packed system .",
    "the overall framework is consistent with previous studies where the energy involved in the packing processes is well described by models of ordered folding  @xcite .",
    "the cavities used in our experiments consist in two plates of glass of 300 mm x 300 mm x 8 mm separated by circular acrylic molds of diameter @xmath0 15 cm and @xmath0 22 cm and 1.1 mm height that allows the wire to be accommodated without superposition .",
    "the simply connected cavities used in our experiments have two channels at opposite sides of the molds for the injection of the wire , but in this study one of them is used to fix one of the wire ends ( fig .  [ apparatus ] ) .",
    "the wires used were made of copper and had a diameter of @xmath1 mm .",
    "initially they were pushed manually into the cavity through one of the channels with an approximately uniform speed of about 1 cm / s until the system reached the jammed state .",
    "the experiments are performed in a dry regime without any lubrication , and its average velocity was estimated by the time needed to inject the wire .",
    "the inner structures formed in the injection process , shown in fig",
    ".   [ apparatus ] , are quite similar to others previously reported in the literature  @xcite , and they were used as our initial condition . a heterogeneous cascade of loops ( units that have a bulge in one extremity , and two branches of the wire merging in the other extremity ) is distributed by the available inner area of the cavity so that the smallest loop is adjacent to the injection channel , while the largest one tends to be located as distant as possible from this channel . the rigid crumpled structures formed in the jammed limit presented on average a maximum packing fraction of @xmath2 for both cavities .    for each diameter of the cavity , we repeated the following procedure for eight equivalent experiments : ( _ i _ ) after the jamming state is reached , we initiate the unpacking process ; ( _ ii _ ) a digital dynamometer is attached to the outer end of the wire such that the force needed to unmake a single loop can be measured within @xmath3 uncertainty and recorded ; ( _ iii _ ) the wire is marked with a permanent marker at the point where the loop starts to be unmade ; ( _ iv _ ) after extracting more and more wire the loop is totally unmade and the point associated with the second extremity of the loop is also marked .",
    "the difference between two consecutive marks is identified as the size of that particular loop .",
    "it is clear from the experimental procedure that the first ( smaller ) extracted loops are harder to pull than the successive ( bigger ) ones which is compatible with the intuitive idea of a jammed state .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( from a to f ) is a sequence of images of the unpacking of a single loop from a circular cavity , where the size of the loop is the extracted length between the images a and f.        it is important to emphasize that , contrarily to what could appear intuitively , the structure of loops within the cavity is self - blocking and it is maintained static even with reduced friction .",
    "this result is , in fact , supported by additional experiments in which cavity and wire were previously treated with mineral oil .",
    "this happens because the passage through the extraction channel is a very strong constraint for the curvature of the wire .",
    "it can be noticed that the elastic structure inside the cavity tends to expand and it increases the difficulty of the alignment of the wire beyond the full extension of the extraction channel . during the extraction of a loop",
    "there is a restoring force , but after each extraction the system finds a new equilibrium state .",
    "here it was useful as an advantage for the usage of the permanent marker .",
    "the profile of the force as a function of the length presents its maximum magnitude near the end of the extraction of the loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]d and [ fig2]e ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the functional shape of the force is repeated for each extracted loop , with a progressive decrease of its maximum magnitude , as the size of the loops continues to increase .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reverse sequence ( from f to a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] could illustrate the insertion of the loop as well .",
    "this last observation have inspired us in several points of this study , as it can be seen in the following pages .",
    "an important difference between the present work and the previous studies of packing of wire is that here the total number of loops and the total length inside the cavity are both initially known quantities .",
    "every experiment of jammed state @xmath4 had its total number of loops @xmath5 recorded .",
    "however , even under similar conditions , the total number of loops @xmath5 varies among the experiments . in our experiments we obtained @xmath5 ranging from 24 to 42 , for @xmath6 = 15 cm , and ranging from 24 to 38 , for @xmath6 = 22 cm .",
    "in order to have an universal domain to take averages , the number of loops remaining in the cavity @xmath7 were normalized by @xmath5 , so that @xmath8 becomes a number that runs from zero to one . in order to assure that the average total number of loops , @xmath9 , is the final quantity of points ,",
    "our averages are taken over intervals of @xmath10 of width , over all data",
    ". follows from this procedure that each point represents , in average , eight experimental data .",
    "the result for the average size ( i.e. arc length ) of the loop , @xmath11 , as a function of the fractional order of unpacked loop , @xmath12 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for copper wires in cavities of 15 cm and 22 cm of diameter .",

    "[ fig3 ] , it can be seen that the size of the smallest loop have the same values , within the error bars , for @xmath6 = 15 cm and for @xmath6 = 22 cm .",
    "this suggests that the minimum value for the size of the loop does not depend on the diameter of the cavity and , instead , depends only on features of the wire ( the plasticity imposes a cutoff in size ) .",
    "on the other hand , the last unpacked loop seems to be proportional to the diameter of the cavity  @xcite .",
    "the standard error of the data shows the high fluctuations involved in a typical experiment of packing of wire  @xcite .",
    "the overall growth of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] resembles an exponential behavior @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an initial size obtained by the @xmath17 extrapolation , and @xmath18 is a continuum growth rate",

    "as commented before , the expected physical invariants are @xmath16 , the smallest scale length , and @xmath23 , the scale length ruled by the cavity .",
    "consequently , @xmath24 does not vary among experiments performed in a same cavity ( unlike @xmath5 ) .",
    "the parameters found correspond to @xmath25 )  cm and @xmath26 )  cm for the size of the last unpacked loop .",
    "the total growth of the loops is expected to scale with the diameter of the cavity , @xmath27 , which implies that @xmath28 ; here @xmath29 while @xmath30 , a small deviation of about @xmath31 .",
    "this suggests that the present model is consistent among different cavities .    an exponential growth as stated in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is obtained from the hypothesis that each loop occupies a fraction of the available space of the cavity discounting early loops .",

    "our wire has a diameter @xmath45  mm .",
    "this entails a corresponding diameter ratio ( @xmath46 ) of at least 350 , a number that impose serious practical problems to be circumvented in the machining process of the cavities , especially for transparent cavities ( glass or acrylic ) , as in our case .",
    "the diameter ratios in our experiment are 150 and 220 , and the maximum diameter ratio in the literature is about 250 @xcite . from this we believe that , although with a limited range , our results have valid contributions for all current studies of crumpled wires in two - dimensions .        fig .",

    "the bent rod is stretched in the external edge of the bulge of the loop and it is shrunk in its internal edge .",
    "the elastic bending energy depends on the curvature @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 depends on the ( supposedly fixed ) cross section of the wire .",

    "[ eq2 ] with @xmath54 and represents the purely elastic bending  @xcite . in this sense",
    "the exponents found experimentally are quite anomalous .",
    "however , our experimental result is safer since the two exponents found by fitting the data are the same within an error interval of @xmath55 and the result is robust over different binnings . from this",
    ", we conclude that a crude model of fixed shape as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] is not suitable in describing our system .",
    "other ingredients as the confining cell , the associative elasticity of all loops and the gradient of the size of the loops , among others , are pivotal for a realistic description of the unpacking of wire in two - dimensional cavities .",
    "as we discuss later on this paper , the exponent @xmath39 found in the experiments can be approximately obtained if we consider the collective behavior of the loops inside the cavity instead of a model of single loop as discussed in the present paragraph .",
    "the length of the wire extracted from the cavity can be obtained by summing the length due to each removed loop , @xmath56 .",

    "[ eq1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] provides @xmath72 which suggests that the size of the loop @xmath11 is a linear function of the fractional pulled length @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from this and eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] that the force is expected to be a power law of @xmath74 with an exponent @xmath39 .",
    "this is a second method to obtain the exponent @xmath39 experimentally , because the high fluctuations in @xmath11 scrambles the order of the loop in the previous case ( observe the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a power law obtained from the total length must preserve the order of the unpacking process .      in order to exhibit the relationship between the force and the length of the wire inside the cavity , an assortment into bins of width @xmath75",

    "[ eq6 ] with @xmath84 .",
    "our model is inspired by previous results from image analysis which indicated that the elastic bending energy in two - dimensional crumpled wires is concentrated in an one - dimensional set , although the mass of the system is distributed in a two - dimensional domain  @xcite .",
    "this is true for the limit of a fulfilled cavity , where the rod is densely packed as parallel nearly straight lines in the bulk of the cavity and the elastic energy due to the compressed loops is concentrated on the perimeter of the cavity .",
    "interestingly , in this limiting case we can state that _ the energy is equal for all loops irrespective of its arc length_. certainly , this conclusion from a particular static configuration does not need to be valid for a serial extraction of loops .",
    "however , we argue that in a mean field approach this statement can be extended for the unpacking of wire .    the wire stores elastic energy in the bulge of its loops , which tend to be as big as they can , in a process which involves repulsion among the neighbor loops .",
    "this interaction between pairs of loops leads to the exchange of energy among the loops confined in the cavity .",
    "of course , a detailed explanation presents some difficulty because the interaction among the loops is complex as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the energy to extract a loop of length @xmath85 is @xmath86 which may be identified as a chemical potential . in order to obtain an expression for the total energy which considers the global features of the system",

    "the energy to extract @xmath63 loops is @xmath89 , then @xmath90 where we have used eq .",
    "thus , the first equality in eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] is a manifestation of the equipartition of energy among the loops .",
    "we stress that eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] is a better expression for the energy of this system when compared with eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] because it takes into account : ( _ i _ ) the whole structure , ( _ ii _ ) the gradient of sizes of the loops , and therefore ( _ iii _ ) the confinement of the wire due to the cavity .",

    "the total bending energy over the wire can be taken loop - by - loop : @xmath93 because the curvature is constant @xmath94 in the circular bulges of length @xmath95 .",

    "<S> the physics of tightly packed structures of a wire and other threadlike materials confined in cavities has been explored in recent years in connection with crumpled systems and a number of topics ranging from applications to dna packing in viral capsids and surgical interventions with catheter to analogies with the electron gas at finite temperature and with theories of two - dimensional quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> when a long piece of wire is injected into two - dimensional cavities , it bends and originates in the jammed limit a series of closed structures that we call loops . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we study the extraction of a crumpled tightly packed wire from a circular cavity aiming to remove loops individually . </S>",
    "<S> the size of each removed loop , the maximum value of the force needed to unpack each loop , and the total length of the extracted wire were measured and related to an exponential growth and a mean field model consistent with the literature of crumpled wires . scaling laws for this process are reported and the relationship between the processes of packing and unpacking of wire is commented upon . </S>"
