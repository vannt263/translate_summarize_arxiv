    "it is found that the states prepared by the pre - processing stage of shor s algorithm , like all periodic states , exhibit the property that their groverian entanglement does not change throughout the qft stage .",
    "one may take the view that the groverian entanglement somehow represents the amount of quantum information present in a quantum state .",
