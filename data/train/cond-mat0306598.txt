    "since their discovery in 1991 , the carbon nanotubes have shown remarkable electronic properties .",
    "they may display quite different behaviors , depending on their geometry and the quality of the contacts used to probe the electronic transport .",
    "it was first predicted@xcite , and later checked experimentally@xcite , that the nanotubes have semiconducting or metallic behavior depending on the helicity of the hexagonal carbon rings wrapped around the tubule .",
    "this is the kind of versatility that points at the carbon nanotubes as ideal molecules to build electronic devices at the nanometer scale@xcite .",
    "the electron correlations are moreover very strong in the carbon nanotubes , what leads to the breakdown of the conventional picture of electronic transport at low energies .",
    "the coulomb interaction prevails in the individual nanotubes@xcite , and it drives the electron system to a state with the properties of the so - called luttinger liquid , characterized by the absence of quasiparticles at the fermi level .",
    "this feature reflects in the power - law behavior of observables like the tunneling density of states , whose suppression at low energies has been actually observed in the measurements of the conductance in the carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "there have been also experiments revealing the existence of superconducting correlations in the nanotubes@xcite .",
    "the first observations were made in nanotube ropes suspended between superconducting electrodes , the most remarkable signal being the appearance of supercurrents for temperatures below the critical value of the contacts@xcite . what has been measured in that experiment",
    "is the proximity effect , by which cooper pairs are formed in the nanotubes near the superconducting contacts .",
    "later , superconducting transitions have been observed in ropes suspended between metallic , nonsuperconducting electrodes@xcite .",
    "the measurements reported in ref .",
    "@xcite point at the existence of a superconducting phase intrinsic to the carbon nanotubes .",
    "more recently , strong superconducting correlations have been also reported in individual nanotubes of very short radius , inserted in a zeolite matrix@xcite .",
    "the observation of superconducting correlations in the nanotubes implies that there is a regime which is different to that marked by the dominance of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the appearance of the superconducting effects requires a suitable attenuation of the repulsive interaction within the nanotubes , due to either the electrostatic coupling among the metallic nanotubes in a rope or the coupling with nearby conductors .",
    "another factor that seems to be crucial is the achievement of high quality contacts between the nanotubes and the electrodes .",
    "this has been possible in the experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite by the use of a technique that allows to sold and suspend the nanotubes between the contacts .",
    "the electrodes were made of a re / au bilayer ( with transition temperature @xmath0 ) in the case of a massive rope , and of a ta / au bilayer ( with @xmath1 ) in the case of a thin rope .",
    "the room - temperature resistance of the ropes was consistent in each case with a resistance of the constituent metallic nanotubes below @xmath2 @xcite , which is of the order of the value @xmath3 corresponding to ballistic transport in a nanotube .    below the transition temperature of the contacts , the nanotubes can support currents without developing any resistance@xcite .",
    "these so - called supercurrents reach a maximum value @xmath4 , which is known as the critical current .",
    "this has been measured for the samples described in ref .",
    "@xcite and , as pointed out there , the magnitudes and temperature dependences obtained can not be understood in the framework of the conventional proximity effect .",
    "the critical current is usually related to the values of the normal resistance @xmath5 and the energy gap @xmath6 in the superconductor through the expression @xmath7 . however , the value estimated in this way turns out to be about 40 times smaller than the experimental measure for the thin rope reported in ref .",
    ". the observed dependence of the critical current on temperature is also very flat in that sample , before getting close to the transition temperature of the electrodes .",
    "this is again at odds with the conventional picture , in which the critical current should reflect the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap at the contacts .    a consistent explanation of the behavior of the supercurrents measured experimentally has been proposed in ref .",
    "it has been stressed there the need to consider the supercurrents as an effect of one - dimensional ( 1d ) transport along the carbon nanotubes .",
    "the propagation of the cooper pairs in the nanotubes is favored in the thick ropes , as there is a larger attenuation in the strength of the coulomb interaction for higher content of metallic nanotubes in a rope@xcite .",
    "the origin of this effect is similar to that of screening in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) conductor . in a rope , however ,",
    "the tunneling amplitude between neighboring metallic nanotubes is highly suppressed in general , due to the misalignment of the respective carbon lattices@xcite .",
    "the absence of a significant intertube electron hopping is what keeps the coulomb interaction long - ranged in the nanotubes , despite the large reduction of its strength in the thick ropes .    in the present paper ,",
    "we confront the results from a microscopic model of the nanotube ropes with the experimental measures from ref .",
    "the propagation of the cooper pairs along the carbon nanotubes gives rise to supercurrents with a strong dependence on the length of the junction , when the coulomb interaction prevails in the electron system .",
    "thus , the measures of the supercurrents , available in two experimental samples with different length and content of metallic nanotubes , can be used to discern the character of the interactions present in the nanotubes .",
    "we will see , in particular , that the value of the critical current in the thin rope reported in ref .",
    "@xcite can be accounted for by considering an attractive component in the electron - electron interaction , coming from the coupling of the electrons to the elastic modes of the carbon lattice . in general",
    ", the balance between the renormalized coulomb interaction in the ropes and the attractive component of the interaction allows to explain the magnitudes as well as the temperature dependence of the critical currents reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the different sources of electron - electron interaction in the carbon nanotubes and describe the microscopic model relevant for the nanotube ropes .",
    "section 3 is devoted to set up the framework used for the study of transport along the junctions .",
    "the comparison between the results from the microscopic model and the experimental data is carried out in section 4 .",
    "finally , the conclusions of our investigation are drawn in section 5 .",
    "we review first the structure of the modes and interactions that take place at low energies in the carbon nanotubes .",
    "the band structure of all the metallic nanotubes has two pairs of linear branches that cross at opposite fermi points ( for undoped nanotubes ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ one ] . for typical nanotubes in a rope with radius @xmath8 around @xmath9  , the electron modes in the energy range below @xmath10 belong to the linear branches near the fermi level , as can be seen from fig .",
    "therefore , we will pay attention only to them when studying the low - energy properties of the carbon nanotubes .",
    "we will carry out the discussion throughout this section having in mind the specific geometry of the armchair nanotubes , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ one ] , while a completely parallel construction can be done for the metallic chiral nanotubes .",
    "the linear branches found near the fermi level can be divided in two classes , according to the different symmetry of their modes under the exchange of the two sublattices of the hexagonal carbon lattice . in the case of armchair nanotubes ,",
    "the two subbands that cross at the fermi level , labeled 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ one ] , correspond to the eigenvalues of the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath11 that operates in the space of the electron amplitudes in the two different atoms of the lattice basis@xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 represents the matrix element of the potential for nearest - neighbor carbon orbitals and @xmath13 is the c - c distance .",
    "then , it is clear that the modes in subband 1 have a smooth amplitude in the carbon lattice , while the modes in subband 2 have an amplitude that alternates the sign when shifting between nearest - neighbor atoms .",
    "this has important consequences regarding the form of the interactions between the different branches .",
    "the coulomb interaction provides a strong source of repulsion between the electrons in the carbon nanotubes .",
    "one may obtain an effective 1d potential @xmath14 on the longitudinal dimension of the nanotube , by taking the average of the 3d interaction over two nanotube sections placed at a spatial separation @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform with respect to this variable gives a potential which is logarithmically singular for small momentum transfer @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 the large momentum @xmath18 , of the order of @xmath19 , survives in the projection onto the longitudinal dimension as a remnant of the finite radius of the nanotube .    actually , the coulomb interaction remains singular only when acting between currents that belong each to a given linear branch .",
    "otherwise , if one of the electron modes is scattered to another branch with different symmetry in the two - atom basis , the product of the _ in _ and _ out _ amplitudes has an alternating sign over the hexagonal carbon lattice .",
    "then , the scattering amplitude averages to zero when making the 1d projection with a large spatial separation @xmath15 along the nanotube .    at short distances , the coulomb interaction may still give rise to a residual 1d interaction mixing _ in _ and _ out _ modes in different linear branches , but these processes do not bear the singular character of the long - range interaction .",
    "this also applies to the processes with large momentum transfer in which the electron modes are scattered from one of the fermi points to the other .",
    "these backscattering and umklapp processes have a strength which is reduced by a factor of the order of @xmath20 with respect to the nominal strength @xmath21 of the long - range coulomb interaction@xcite . for nanotubes with @xmath22  ,",
    "that factor has a magnitude of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the backscattering and umklapp interactions of this kind turn out to be negligible in comparison to the coulomb interaction between currents in definite linear branches .",
    "another source of electron - electron interaction comes from the coupling of the electrons to the elastic modes of the carbon lattice .",
    "the exchange of phonons gives rise to a retarded interaction , which can be represented in terms of an effective potential @xmath24 of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the phonon energy and the @xmath27 are appropriate electron - phonon couplings .",
    "thus , for frequencies @xmath28 below the characteristic phonon energies , the potential @xmath24 may reach negative values , providing then a kind of effective attraction between the electrons .",
    "the strength of the effective interaction depends on the electron - phonon couplings @xmath27 , where the indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 label the gapless subbands to which the _ in _ and _ out _ electron modes belong . for the computation of the @xmath27",
    ", we rely on the tight - binding approximation , which is fairly appropriate for the carbon nanotubes . the electron - phonon couplings can be represented by a sum over nearest neighbors of the atoms in the unit cell of the nanotube@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the phonon polarization vector at site @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the respective amplitudes of the incoming and outgoing electrons , @xmath36 is the matix element of the potential between orbitals at @xmath33 and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the mass per unit length .",
    "we are already implying that the coupling can be expressed as a function of @xmath39 , what is a reasonable approximation for small values of that momentum transfer ( modulo @xmath40 ) .    the product of the two couplings in ( [ pot ] )",
    "can be actually positive or negative , depending on the linear branches involved@xcite .",
    "the sign is dictated by symmetry rules which are direct consequence of the geometry of the nanotube lattice .",
    "we illustrate that fact for the case of the armchair nanotubes , though a similar argument can be developed in general for metallic chiral nanotubes . thus",
    ", taking into account that the modes with antibonding character have an amplitude with alternating sign in nearest - neighbor sites , we observe from inspection of ( [ tight ] ) that @xmath41 the electrons can be also scattered from one of the subbands to the other by exchanging phonons . the fact that one of the modes has",
    "then antibonding character reflects in the antisymmetric condition @xmath42 the relations ( [ long1 ] ) and ( [ long2 ] ) are based on symmetry rules , and they hold irrespective of whether the exchanged phonons are optical or acoustic .    using the fact that @xmath43 , it is clear from ( [ pot ] ) that the exchange of phonons gives rise to an attractive electron - electron interaction when the electrons are scattered within the same subband . on the other hand , the condition ( [ long1 ] ) on the couplings makes the interaction repulsive between electron currents in different subbands .",
    "these considerations hold for frequencies below the typical debye energy of the phonons , which is in the range between 0.1 and 0.2 ev for nanotubes with radius around @xmath44 @xcite . taking into account these magnitudes",
    ", one can make an estimate of the strength of the effective interaction , which turns out to be of the order of @xmath45 .",
    "when describing the low - energy dynamics of the electrons , one has to bear in mind the special structure of the nanotube ropes .",
    "these are made of a disordered mixture of nanotubes with different helicities and diameters . in these conditions ,",
    "the tunneling of electrons between neighboring metallic nanotubes is highly suppressed .",
    "this comes from the fact that the carbon lattices of neighboring nanotubes are not aligned in general , what leads to a mismatch between the respective fermi points and to the consequent difficulty to conserve the longitudinal momentum in the tunneling process@xcite .",
    "an experimental signature of the very small tunneling amplitude has been observed in the measurement of the coupling resistance between tubes , which has shown wide variations ranging between @xmath46 and @xmath47 in different samples@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which the tunneling amplitude between nanotubes may be about three orders of magnitude below the electron hopping amplitude within the carbon lattice .",
    "we will therefore assume that the coupling between nanotubes is given by the coulomb interaction , and that the kinetic energy of the electrons can be represented by the sum of the kinetic energies of the metallic nanotubes in the rope .    within each nanotube , one has to balance the repulsive coulomb interaction and the effective electron - electron interaction coming from phonon exchange .",
    "as remarked above , there are no significant backscattering or umklapp processes coming from the coulomb interaction , so that the competition between that and the effective attraction takes place in processes where the scattered electrons remain in their respective branches .",
    "our approach will focus on the description of this balance between repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "for that purpose , we will build a model in which the elementary objects are the electron density operators , given in terms of the fermi fields @xmath48 for the different linear branches ( shown in fig .",
    "[ two ] ) by @xmath49 the label @xmath13 runs over the different metallic nanotubes in a rope , @xmath50 .",
    "the index @xmath51 is used to label the left- or right - moving character of the linear branch , and the index @xmath52 to label the fermi point . in this way , we are setting aside the backscattering processes , which tend anyhow to enhance the superconducting correlations@xcite .",
    "then , it can be thought that our model leads to a slight underestimation of these effects , for a given strength of the bare attractive interaction .",
    "this can be otherwise corrected by a suitable renormalization of the effective coupling derived from phonon exchange , assuming that it reaches greater values in the low - energy regime of the model@xcite .    according to the above considerations , we write the hamiltonian for a nanotube rope in the form @xmath53 the first term in ( [ ham ] ) comes from the known representation of the kinetic energy for a 1d electron system@xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath54 mediates the interactions within a given nanotube for @xmath55 and between different nanotubes for @xmath56 . due to the long - range character of the coulomb interaction , its contribution has to be included in all the elements @xmath57 .",
    "it is only for @xmath58 , however , that one has to add the contributions arising from phonon exchange within each nanotube .",
    "we can introduce two plausible assumptions that lead to a straightforward resolution of the model under study .",
    "the first is that all the interactions in the nanotube system are spin - independent .",
    "then , it is appropriate to introduce the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of density operators for the two spin projections . only the charge density operators @xmath59 enter in the interaction term of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "this implies , in particular for the calculation of the correlators , that half of the degrees of freedom in the model are not affected by the interaction .",
    "we will further assume that the strength of the effective interaction from phonon exchange does not depend on the particular linear branches to which the scattered electron modes belong .",
    "we know however that , if the interaction takes place between currents in different subbands , the condition ( [ long1 ] ) introduces a relative minus sign .",
    "it is convenient to define the respective charge density operators for the bonding and the antibonding subband @xmath60    the coulomb interaction has always repulsive character , and it acts on the symmetric combination of ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath61 the effective interaction from phonon exchange is attractive between currents in the same subband , but repulsive for currents in different subbands .",
    "it therefore acts on the antisymmetric combination @xmath62    in the new density variables , the hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 parametrizes the strength of the effective interaction from phonon exchange .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) encompasses the main interactions in the nanotube system , providing a suitable starting point to study the superconducting correlations in the nanotube ropes .",
    "we introduce in what follows the theoretical framework appropriate for the description of supercurrents in the carbon nanotubes .",
    "the study of the josephson effect in a luttinger liquid placed between macroscopic superconductors has been carried out in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first review briefly the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the calculation of the critical current through that kind of junction .    in order to describe the coupling to superconducting electrodes ,",
    "one more term @xmath65 has to be added to the hamiltonian of the 1d system for each of the tunnel junctions created at the contacts .",
    "the term @xmath65 expresses the hopping of electrons from the 1d system to the superconductor and viceversa , with a given tunneling amplitude @xmath66 .",
    "it has then the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the electron field at the end of the superconductor @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is a generic electron field of the 1d system .    on top of that , one has also to include the hamiltonians describing the condensates for the respective macroscopic superconductors . for our purposes , all the relevant information about their properties can be given in terms of the respective order parameters @xmath71 and normal densities of states @xmath72 at the contacts .",
    "the supercurrent @xmath73 through the 1d system can be computed in terms of the derivative of the free energy @xmath74 with respect to the phase difference @xmath75 of the order parameters@xcite @xmath76 when the junctions are not highly transparent , one can adopt a perturbative approach by expanding in powers of the tunneling hamiltonians @xmath65 . for usual instances in which the time of propagation between the tunnel junctions is larger than @xmath77 , the contributions to the derivative in ( [ cur ] ) are dominated by processes in which the cooper pairs tunnel from one of the superconductors to the 1d system , propagating then to the other superconducting contact@xcite .",
    "these first perturbative contributions give the result @xmath78 where the statistical averages , at temperature @xmath79 , are taken over ordered products with respect to imaginary time @xmath80 , in the respective systems of the fields .    at low enough temperatures",
    ", we can approximate the statistical averages at the boundary of the superconductors by delta functions in imaginary time @xmath81 @xmath82 being the phase of the order parameter .",
    "then the expression ( [ pert ] ) is greatly simplified .",
    "the maximum value of the supercurrent , that we call critical current @xmath83 , is given by @xmath84    we now make the passage to apply the above approach to the case of the carbon nanotubes .",
    "the critical current in ( [ crit ] ) is given in terms of the propagator of the cooper pairs along the 1d system .",
    "we need therefore to compute that object with the fields corresponding to the linear branches crossing the fermi level of the carbon nanotubes , in the model governed by the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the 1d correlators can be accomplished by making use of bosonization techniques@xcite . for each linear branch of the carbon nanotubes",
    ", one can define a boson operator @xmath85 , related to the respective electron density operator by @xmath86 the bosonization method relies on the feasibility of expressing the fermion fields in terms of the respective boson operators : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a short - distance cutoff of the order of @xmath89 @xcite .    in the case of the carbon nanotubes ,",
    "the propagator that enters in the computation of the critical current in ( [ crit ] ) is of the type @xmath90 where the choice of linear branches accounts for the fact that the cooper pairs are formed with zero total momentum .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ prop ] ) can be done by using the bosonization formulas ( [ bos ] ) and passing to the combination of boson fields that bring the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) into diagonal form .",
    "we observe then that , in the nanotube ropes , the coulomb interaction acts only on the combination of density operators corresponding to the total charge density in the rope .",
    "that is , the repulsive interaction becomes sensible only in one out of the @xmath91 possible interaction channels , arising from the @xmath92 different metallic nanotubes and the degeneracy in the gapless subbands and spin projections .",
    "the @xmath91 different channels can be classified into the sectors corresponding to the sum and the difference of electronic charge in the gapless subbands , and the rest which take into account the spin densities for the two spin projections .",
    "the expression of correlators like ( [ prop ] ) factorizes into contributions for each of the different sectors , in such a way that the propagator for the cooper pairs can be written in the form @xmath93 the first factor comes from the propagation of the total charge density from all the metallic nanotubes , which has a purely electrostatic interaction .",
    "the next @xmath92 equivalent factors stand for the contribution of the charge mismatch in the gapless subbands , which bears the effect of the attractive interaction according to ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath94 factors account for the free propagation of the rest of density excitations , including the spin degrees of freedom and charge degrees of freedom orthogonal to those affected by the interaction .",
    "each of the factors in ( [ fac ] ) corresponds to the propagation of a boson field . at zero temperature , for instance ,",
    "all of them adhere to the common expression @xmath95 the respective quantities @xmath96 arise in the change to the variables that make the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) diagonal .",
    "this process also leads to a renormalization of the respective fermi velocities , given by @xmath97 . in the case of @xmath98",
    ", we have @xmath99 , while for @xmath100 the quantity @xmath96 does not depend on the momentum , @xmath101 . for the rest of excitations with free propagation , we simply have @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    in practice ,",
    "one is interested in the behavior of the supercurrents at finite temperature , which requires moreover the knowledge of the propagator ( [ prop ] ) at imaginary time .",
    "for this reason , it is more appropriate to deal with the representation of objects like ( [ com ] ) at finite temperature in the matsubara formalism , introducing the sum over discrete frequencies @xmath104 : @xmath105    thus , the framework developed is well - suited to discuss the behavior of the supercurrents in carbon nanotubes depending on the temperature @xmath79 , the distance @xmath106 between the superconducting contacts , the number @xmath92 of metallic nanotubes in a rope , and the competition between the repulsion given by the coulomb interaction and the effective attraction given by phonon exchange .",
    "in this section we establish the comparison with the experimental measures of supercurrents in carbon nanotubes reported in ref .",
    "the supercurrents were observed in two nanotube samples with different structure .",
    "one of them consisted of a rope containing approximately 200 nanotubes , with a length of about @xmath107 .",
    "the other sample was made of seven tubes merging at one of the ends into a single nanotube , extending to a total length of @xmath108 .",
    "it has been remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite that the critical current @xmath109 measured in the thin rope was about 40 times larger than expected within the conventional framework of the proximity effect .",
    "the very flat shape of the critical current as a function of the temperature was also surprising , as its decay was only apparent in the neighborhood of the critical temperature for the superconducting electrodes .",
    "the thick rope showed a more conventional behavior , although the decay of the supercurrent at the critical temperature of the electrodes was not as sharp as expected@xcite .",
    "we face the challenge of accounting for the experimental values and features of the critical currents with our microscopic model , that allows to describe ropes with any kind of nanotube content . in this respect ,",
    "our computational framework has only a few adjustable parameters .",
    "the prefactors that affect the strength of the critical current in ( [ crit ] ) can be encoded into the relative conductances @xmath110 at the tunnel junctions , given ( in units of @xmath111 ) by @xmath112 .",
    "the critical current gets the right dimensions from the combination @xmath113 , that arises after setting @xmath114 and performing the integral in ( [ crit ] ) over the dimensionless variable @xmath115 .",
    "the expression of the critical current becomes @xmath116 where @xmath117 represents the distance between the superconducting contacts .",
    "equation ( [ crit2 ] ) gives the critical current per metallic nanotube in a rope .",
    "we observe that the order of magnitude is given at short distances by the quantity @xmath113 .",
    "it is reasonable to set the short distance cutoff according to the scale of the nanotube diameter , and we will take @xmath118 for typical nanotubes in a rope .",
    "this sets a unit scale @xmath119 for the critical currents in carbon nanotubes .",
    "one has to bear in mind , however , that the critical currents obtained from ( [ crit2 ] ) display a strong dependence on the distance between superconducting contacts . their decay for increasing length @xmath117 can be very pronounced in ropes with a small number of metallic nanotubes , where the electron interactions are predominantly repulsive .",
    "the behavior at large @xmath117 becomes much softer in the thick ropes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ three ] . in general",
    ", the decay of the critical currents with the length @xmath117 is not given by a simple power - law , since the dependence of the coulomb potential @xmath120 on the momentum prevents the perfect scaling of the observables at long distances .",
    "the results shown in fig . [ three ] allow us to draw the comparison with the values of the critical currents at @xmath121 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . the appropriate correspondence with the thin rope described there is established by making the reasonable assumption that two out of the seven nanotubes in the rope are metallic .",
    "moreover , we determine the theoretical value of the critical current by looking at the decay along the distance between the contacts , setting @xmath122 for the thin rope . for that choice of the parameters and taking a strength @xmath123 for the coulomb interaction ,",
    "we observe that the experimental value of the critical current ( @xmath124 ) can be matched by taking a coupling for the attractive interaction @xmath125 . actually , the value of the integral in ( [ crit2 ] ) at zero temperature for @xmath126 and @xmath122 is @xmath127 , which gives a critical current @xmath128 ( times @xmath129 ) after adding the contributions of the two metallic nanotubes .",
    "the precise determination of the critical current is affected by the values of the relative conductances @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is however reassuring the fact that , once the interaction strengths are fixed to the above mentioned values , one can reproduce approximately the ratio between the critical currents observed in the two different samples where the supercurrents have been measured . in the case of the thick rope",
    ", we assume that it may have a number of metallic nanotubes @xmath132 , and we make the estimate of the critical current by computing the decay for a @xmath107-long rope , which corresponds to @xmath133 in our model .",
    "the value of the integral in ( [ crit2 ] ) at zero temperature for @xmath134 and @xmath135 is @xmath136 .",
    "this leads us to assure that the critical current in the thick rope should be about 40 times greater than that in the thin rope , taking into account the approximate ratio between the number of metallic nanotubes in the two samples .",
    "this agrees well with the order of magnitude of the experimental value @xmath137 for the thick rope reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the other important check is that our model is able to account for the dependence of the critical currents on temperature observed experimentally .",
    "we have represented in fig . [",
    "four ] the behavior obtained from ( [ crit2 ] ) , computing now the critical current at a fixed distance @xmath122 , for the thin rope with @xmath126 ( and keeping a suitable value of the coupling @xmath125 ) . the temperature is measured in units of @xmath138 .",
    "thus , in the case of the thin rope , the transition temperature @xmath139 of the superconducting contacts corresponds to a value @xmath140 in the scale of fig . [",
    "we observe that the natural behavior of the critical current is being flat over such range of small temperatures , in agreement with the experimental measures in the thin rope studied in ref .",
    "the present results can be trusted while remaining away from the critical temperature @xmath141 of the superconducting electrodes , as we have not paid attention to the dependence of their gaps on temperature .",
    "the sharp decay of the critical current observed experimentally near @xmath141 is just the natural consequence of approaching the superconducting transition of the contacts .",
    "we have to remark , however , that the flat behavior of the critical current as a function of @xmath79 is a consequence of the short distance along which it has been measured in the thin rope . for long enough ropes",
    ", there is a crossover temperature above which the behavior changes to a more pronounced decrease of the critical current .",
    "this can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ four ] , where it has been represented the critical current that would correspond to a thin rope with @xmath126 and length @xmath142 . in that case",
    ", the critical current at zero temperature would be @xmath143 ( times @xmath129 ) .",
    "most remarkably , an inflection point is observed in the dependence on temperature . on physical grounds , such a crossover temperature marks the point above which the thermal effects begin to affect significantly the propagation of the cooper pairs , inducing the pronounced decrease of the supercurrent .    the crossover temperature for the critical current is always found below a scale which is of the order of @xmath144 .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the behavior of the @xmath107-long rope described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an inflection point can be seen in the plot of the critical current as a function of the temperature .",
    "we have represented in fig . [",
    "five ] the results for the critical current computed from ( [ crit2 ] ) , for @xmath134 and @xmath142 .",
    "bearing in mind that the temperature is measured in the figure in units of @xmath145 , we observe that the inflection point in the curve of @xmath83 corresponds to a crossover temperature @xmath146 .",
    "this is in close agreement with the experimental measures reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have also represented in fig . [",
    "five ] the behavior that should be expected if the thick rope were shrinked down to a length of @xmath147 , keeping the same number of metallic nanotubes . in that case",
    ", the critical current at zero temperature could be as large as @xmath148 ( times @xmath129 ) . in agreement with our preceding discussion",
    ", the crossover temperature would be shifted in the shorter sample to @xmath149 , a value that would be in general larger than the transition temperature of the contacts and would make then the crossover unobservable .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a transport approach with the aim of accounting for the properties of the supercurrents measured in carbon nanotubes .",
    "some important features of the critical currents reported in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be explained within the conventional picture of the proximity effect . in that framework ,",
    "the values of the supercurrent at zero temperature are given by the expression @xmath150 , where @xmath5 is the normal resistance of the junction .",
    "that estimate falls short by a factor of 40 , for instance , to reproduce the critical current measured in the @xmath108-long rope considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the 1d approach",
    "we have adopted , the values of the critical currents are determined instead by the scale of the distance between the superconducting contacts , provided that such a quantity is greater than the coherence length in the superconductors .",
    "the theoretical values found in this way are in agreement with the experimental measures for the two samples where supercurrents have been reported in ref . @xcite .    even in a 1d framework , it is possible to make two different descriptions depending on whether the contacts are supposed to be perfectly transmitting or not . in the first case ,",
    "the decay of the critical current turns out to be independent of the strength of the interactions at low temperatures@xcite",
    ". such an instance may not be the most appropriate to describe the experimental conditions of the measurements of the proximity effect described in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in the latter",
    ", no evidence of supercurrents has been found for individual nanotubes with a length of about @xmath108 , placed between nb contacts .",
    "one may think that the main difference between the conditions of the experiments described in refs . @xcite and @xcite lies in that , in the former , the samples were made of ropes suspended between the electrodes .",
    "such conditions seem to be determinant for the observation of supercurrents , what is supported by the fact that the normal resistances of the junctions were comparable in the two kind of experiments .",
    "this should lead us to conclude that the electron - electron interactions play an important role in the observation of the proximity effect in the mentioned experiments .",
    "we have consequently adopted the point of view in which the single - particle scattering dominates at the contacts between the nanotubes and the electrodes . in these conditions ,",
    "the values of the critical current depend sensibly on the strength of the coulomb repulsion and the attractive interaction arising from phonon exchange . in the thinner ropes , the repulsive interaction does not suffer a significant reduction from the electrostatic coupling among a small number of metallic nanotubes , and this explains the comparatively small magnitudes of the supercurrents in those instances .",
    "the value of the critical current @xmath151 for the very thin rope reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is actually dictated by the relatively small distance ( @xmath147 ) between the contacts in that sample .",
    "we can foresee that , in a similar rope with only two metallic nanotubes extending over a distance @xmath152 between superconducting contacts , the value of the critical current should decay to a magnitude of @xmath153 .    in the thicker ropes ,",
    "larger supercurrents are expected as the strength of the coulomb repulsion is significantly reduced from the interaction among the different metallic nanotubes .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that the coupling resistance between tubes in a rope is typically above @xmath154 , what leads to assume that the conduction is confined to the individual nanotubes .",
    "then , each metallic nanotube in the rope provides a different channel for the propagation of cooper pairs , whenever there is good contact with the superconducting electrodes .",
    "this condition can be difficult to ensure from an experimental point of view , introducing some uncertainty about the real number of metallic nanotubes that may contribute to carry the supercurrent .",
    "we have seen , in particular , that it is possible to account for the value of the critical current in the thick rope described in ref .",
    "@xcite , by adding the currents for the approximate number of metallic nanotubes in the rope .",
    "finally , let us remark that we have also given a satisfactory description of the temperature dependence of the critical currents reported in ref .",
    "the steady behavior of the critical current in the thin rope studied there can be understood as a consequence of the relatively short distance between superconducting contacts for that sample .",
    "we have seen that , for sufficiently long nanotubes , it is possible to observe a crossover in temperature from the flat behavior to a pronounced decay of the critical current , before the transition temperature of the contacts is reached .",
    "the crossover has to take place at a temperature which is in general slightly below the scale of @xmath155 , and it manifest by the presence of an inflection point in the plot of the critical current as a function of the temperature .",
    "such a feature has been actually seen in the experimental measures of the @xmath107-long rope studied in ref .",
    "this comes as a genuine signature of the propagation of the cooper pairs along the nanotubes , and stresses once again the suitability of the transport approach to account for the unconventional properties observed in the carbon nanotubes ."
