    "increasing disorder is known to suppress superconductivity in low - dimensional systems such as thin films and narrow wires@xcite .",
    "this occurs because the disorder causes electrons to move diffusively rather than ballistically , making them less efficient at screening the coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "the increased coulomb repulsion decreases both the electron - electron attraction needed for superconductivity , and the density of states of electrons available for pairing at the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "typical types of experimental data are : ( i ) @xmath4 , the transition temperature as a function of normal state resistance per square@xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath5 , the order parameter at zero temperature , as a function of normal state resistance per square@xcite ; ( iii ) @xmath6 , the upper critical field as a function of temperature and normal state resistance per square@xcite ; ( iv ) @xmath7 , transition temperature as a function of resistance per square and spin - flip scattering rate in films with magnetic impurities.@xcite it is found experimentally that @xmath4 curves from a wide variety of materials fit a universal curve with a single fitting parameter , whilst the few experimental measurements of @xmath8 , seem to have @xmath9 roughly constant@xcite .",
    "this fitting to a single curve , whilst pleasing in showing that the basic ingredients of our theories are correct , does not allow detailed analysis of the theory .",
    "data of types ( iii ) and ( iv ) are more promising because there is an additional parameter to vary  the magnetic field in ( iii ) , and spin - flip scattering rate in ( iv ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only one experiment of type ( iv ) has been performed@xcite , and we discuss it elsewhere.@xcite several experiments of type ( iii ) have been performed@xcite ; some seem to show a positive curvature in @xmath0 at low temperature as disorder is increased .",
    "moreover this effect is predicted by theory@xcite , and this seems to be another confirmation of the basic theoretical model .",
    "however , we need to be careful : positive curvature in @xmath0 is a ubiquitous feature of exotic superconductors@xcite , and occurs in many systems where localization is not believed to be the cause .",
    "indeed any pair - breaking mechanism that varies as a function of magnetic field can lead to such anomalous behaviour in @xmath2 .",
    "this means that it is often difficult to distinguish between the various mechanisms that might be present .",
    "it is therefore particularly important to be sure of our theory , and in this light we re - examine the predictions of localization theory .",
    "one of the main problems of the localization theory is that even first - order perturbation theory results are hard to obtain correctly .",
    "the first - order results are capable of explaining experimental data in the weak disorder regime , but for stronger disorder it is clear that we need something else .",
    "as an example consider the prediction for @xmath10 suppression@xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is transition temperature for clean system , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the elastic scattering time .",
    "this yields an exponential curve for @xmath4 , which behaves like a straight line for small @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath10 deduced from this equation can never go to zero for finite @xmath1 , as happens in experiment .",
    "a very simple ad hoc way of going beyond simple perturbation theory is to replace @xmath12 on the right hand side by @xmath10 , pleading perhaps to self - consistency .",
    "if we define @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , the new equation has the cubic form @xmath18 and can easily be solved .",
    "however a new problem emerges because there are two positive roots for every value of @xmath1 . at first",
    "we can take the larger of the roots , on physical principles , because it is this root which tends to @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "however we eventually come to a re - entrance point beyond which no solutions exist .",
    "it is clear that this re - entrance is unphysical , an artefact of our ad hoc extension of perturbation theory . in the case of @xmath4",
    "the story has a happy ending in that perturbation theory can be correctly extended by a renormalization group ( rg ) treatment based on finkelstein s interacting non - linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "this leads to the result @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "this equation reduces to the first - order result for small @xmath23 and now @xmath10 goes smoothly to zero at @xmath24 .",
    "the three curves are plotted for comparison in fig .",
    "the reason for discussing @xmath4 in detail above is that the same problem occurs for @xmath6 .",
    "the standard theory in this case@xcite , due to maekawa , ebisawa and fukuyama ( mef ) is the equivalent of the ad hoc extension discussed above , and has the form @xmath25\\right)-r_{hf}-r_v",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ r_{hf}&=&\\displaystyle-{1\\over 2}t\\ln^2{\\left({1\\over 2\\pi t_c\\tau}\\right ) } -t\\ln{\\left({1\\over 2\\pi t_c\\tau}\\right ) } \\left[\\psi\\left({1\\over 2}\\right )",

    "2}+{1\\over 2\\pi t_c\\tau_h}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 .",
    "this equation suffers similar re - entrance problems at finite @xmath27 to those found at @xmath28 , when it is just the @xmath10 equation . indeed",
    "the @xmath0 curves can only be plotted down to the value of @xmath3 at which re - entrance occurs , and at this point the curves appear to have infinite slope .",
    "this leads to us asking the question of whether the positive curvature in @xmath0 is also an artefact of the ad hoc approximation used .",
    "what we need to answer this question is the finite magnetic field analogue of the rg result discussed above .",
    "however the rg is very difficult , and the answer is not forthcoming from this source .",
    "fortunately oreg and finkelstein@xcite have recently shown that the rg result can be obtained from a diagrammatic resummation technique .",
    "this method has the great advantage of being analytically tractable and easy to use . in this paper",
    "we extend this approach to finite magnetic field to see whether we really do expect positive curvature in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed this paper is intended as somewhat of a showcase for this resummation method , to demonstrate the ease of its extension to a wide variety of problems .",
    "oreg and finkelstein@xcite take the coulomb interaction to be featureless , and we shall follow them . we should therefore explain why it is legitimate to use a featureless interaction rather than the correct screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the screened coulomb interaction has a singularity at low momentum , and one might naively think that this would lead to a strong enhancement of the suppression of transition temperature .",
    "however a cancellation occurs between diagrams 14 and diagram 5 of fig .",
    "2 , which effectively removes the low momentum singularity@xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction is then effectively featureless , all diagrammatic sums being dominated by large frequency and momentum .",
    "it turns out that one gets the same result from doing the perturbation theory correctly with the screened coulomb interaction as from using a constant interaction of strength @xmath29 and keeping only diagrams 14 .",
    "this is what we shall do in this paper .",
    "we also note that the re - summation method of oreg and finkelstein@xcite keeps only diagrams 3 and 4 , which is again legitimate as their contribution is greater than that from diagrams 1 and 2 .",
    "however it is not difficult to include these terms in the re - summation , as we will show in section .",
    "the cancellation of low momentum singularities is expected to be a general feature , enforced by gauge invariance , so we are free to ignore them and use a featureless interaction as long as we include the diagrams that give the dominant contribution at large frequency and momentum .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "we review the first - order perturbation calculation for @xmath0 assuming a featureless coulomb interaction .",
    "we derive the analytical mef formula by making an asymptotic approximation to the matsubara frequency sums which arise in perturbation theory .",
    "we make plots of @xmath0 both by solving the implicit mef equation , and its equivalent where the matsubara sums are performed exactly .",
    "surprisingly we find no positive curvature in the latter case .",
    "in section we derive @xmath0 using the resummation technique both in the form used by oreg and finkelstein , and also in an extended form which includes self - energy diagrams missed in their formalism .",
    "again we find no positive curvature in @xmath0 . in section",
    "we discuss the experimental situation and draw conclusions .",
    "in this section we will carefully review the first - order perturbation theory calculation@xcite of @xmath0 .",
    "we do this in detail because we will show that accurately performing sums rather than making an analytical approximation to them removes the upward curvature in @xmath0 .",
    "we identify @xmath10 as the temperature at which the magnetic field dependent pair propagator diverges . to find the latter we calculate the correction to the momentum - dependent pair propagator , @xmath30 , and then make the usual substitution @xmath31 , where @xmath26 . the zeroth - order ( mean field )",

    "diagrams 1 and 3 involve the summation of three terms to form a hikami box@xcite , the general form for which is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the @xmath39 being the incoming momenta , and the @xmath40 the matsubara frequencies on the electron green functions in the box . using standard diagrammatic rules , and the above result for the hikami box , we obtain the 4 contributions to the pair polarization bubble @xmath41 we note that the relative signs of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are irrelevant in the sum , since the summand depends only upon @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and that the featurelessness of the potential allows us to shift the momentum sum in terms 2 and 4 . we find that terms 1 and 2 partially cancel , whilst terms 3 and 4 reinforce , to yield the sum @xmath46[\\epsilon_l+\\epsilon_n]}+ { 1\\over[\\epsilon_l+1/\\tau_h][\\epsilon_n+1/\\tau_h ] } \\left[\\ln{\\left({1\\over[\\epsilon_l+\\epsilon_n]\\tau}\\right ) } + { 1\\over[\\epsilon_l+\\epsilon_n]\\tau_h}\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and we have performed the @xmath48-sum and set @xmath31 .    we first reproduce mef s analytic approximation to the sums over matsubara frequencies . to do this it turns out to be easier to make a choice of relative sign of matsubara frequencies , @xmath49 , and to set @xmath50 . if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the sum becomes @xmath53m}+ { 1\\over[l+1/2+\\alpha][m - l-1/2+\\alpha ] } \\left[\\ln{\\left({m\\over m}\\right)}+{\\alpha\\over m}\\right ] \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\displaystyle-{g\\over 4\\pi^2d}\\sum_{m=1}^{m } \\left[\\psi\\left({1\\over 2}+m+\\alpha\\right ) -\\psi\\left({1\\over 2}+\\alpha\\right)\\right ] \\left\\{{1\\over m}+{2\\over ( m+2\\alpha)}\\left[\\ln{\\left({m\\over m}\\right ) } + { \\alpha\\over m}\\right]\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "if we first evaluate the sum for @xmath56 , we see that it will be dominated by large @xmath57 , so we replace the difference of digamma functions by @xmath58 , and the sum over @xmath57 by an integral to get @xmath59.\\ ] ] to evaluate the result for finite @xmath60 we subtract off the @xmath56 result and try to analytically approximate the difference .",
    "again we expect the sum to be dominated by large @xmath57 , so we can ignore the @xmath60 in @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and ignore the term proportional to @xmath60 as it is less divergent .",

    "putting the eqns .",
    "( [ mefpapprox ] ) and ( [ mfpapprox ] ) into eqn .",
    "( [ tch ] ) yields the mef formula cited in eqn .",
    "( [ mef ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this approximation , although apparently reasonable , is not justified .",
    "if we plot the values of @xmath66 calculated by performing the sums directly , we find that they do not agree with eqn .",
    "( [ mef ] ) .",
    "consequently the @xmath0 curves predicted by the analytic approximation and exact sum are also different .    0.25truein    on the left side of fig .",
    "3 we display @xmath0 predicted by the mef result of eqn .",
    "( [ mef ] ) for several values of @xmath1 in the case where @xmath67 .",
    "we clearly see the positive curvature at low temperature , and the result that the curves all terminate at finite @xmath3 due to re - entrance problems . on the right side of fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath0 deduced directly from the first - order perturbation theory result of eqn .",
    "( [ passum ] ) .",
    "we note that since the answers we get depend upon the logarithm of the upper cut - off , if we treat the upper cut - off differently , we will get slightly different answers .",
    "however , this difference will always be lost in fitting to experiment since we determine the unknown upper cut - off parameter from the initial slope of the data .",
    "the reason we mention this is that the exact sums can be performed in two slightly different ways : we can have the sum over @xmath42 and @xmath68 , or the sum over @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the cut - offs in each case being taken at @xmath69 .",
    "the results are slightly different due to different treatment of the upper cut - off . however in both cases",
    "we find no positive curvature in @xmath0 .",
    "there is still the problem that the curves finish at finite @xmath3 because of re - entrance , and this tells us that the ad hoc prescription being used to go beyond first - order perturbation theory is still inadequate .",
    "but again we stress the key point of this section : even within the ad hoc extension of first - order perturbation theory , we do not get positive curvature in @xmath0 if we do the matsubara sums exactly .",
    "in this section we answer the question of what is the correct way to go beyond first - order perturbation theory . to do this , we extend a resummation technique recently developed by oreg and finkelstein@xcite ( of ) .",
    "this involves calculating the pair scattering amplitude , @xmath70 , and identifying @xmath10 as the temperature at which it first diverges .",
    "the ladder summation involved is shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "4 this is actually an extended version of the of approach because as well as considering diagrams 3 and 4 of fig .  2 , which correspond to an effective coulomb pseudopotential , and end up in the block @xmath71 , we also consider diagrams 1 and 2 of fig .  2 , which correspond to an effective self - energy , and end up in the block @xmath72 which renormalises the cooperon impurity ladder .",
    "in fact we will consider both versions of the summation technique : the simpler one involves using the bare cooperon @xmath73 rather than the dressed one @xmath74 .",
    "of demonstrate that the matrix equation they obtain in 2d can be approximated by a parquet - like differential equation that turns out to be identical to that obtained from renormalization group analysis . instead of generating a continuous approximation to the matrix equation , we simply solve the equation and change the temperature ( which affects the upper cut - off @xmath55 ) until we find the first zero eigenvalue of the matrix , at which point it has become singular , and we have reached @xmath10 . numerically this involves diagonalizing matrices of rank less than 2000 or so .",
    "let us now proceed to the calculation of the pair amplitude matrix @xmath75 . if we evaluate the diagrams of fig .  4 ,",
    "but ignore the magnetic field and self - energy correction to the cooperon , we obtain the same equation as of , @xmath76 { 1\\over |\\epsilon_m|}\\gamma(\\epsilon_m,\\epsilon_l)\\ ] ] except that we have explicitly kept both positive and negative matsubara frequencies because the expression for @xmath77 will turn out to depend upon whether its two matsubara frequencies have the same or opposite sign .",
    "this is a reflection of the breaking of time - reversal invariance caused by the magnetic field .",
    "let us first see how to solve the above equation , and then later put in the magnetic field , and the correction to the cooperon . as a matrix equation , it takes the form @xmath78{\\hat\\epsilon}^{-1}{\\hat\\gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this has the solution @xmath83 where @xmath84{\\hat\\epsilon}^{-1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath85 is the identity matrix .",
    "it follows that when the matrix @xmath86 has an eigenvalue equal to @xmath87 , the pair amplitude diverges , and we have found @xmath10 .",
    "our approach is therefore to start at the mean field transition temperature , @xmath12 , and decrease temperature until one of the eigenvalues of @xmath88 changes sign .",
    "the matrix @xmath89 depends upon @xmath3 both through the dependence of @xmath90 upon @xmath3 and through its rank @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "we start at the mean - field value of @xmath93 , which we will call @xmath94 , and decrease the temperature by increasing @xmath93 successively by one .",
    "we diagonalize the matrix @xmath95 for each value of @xmath93 until an eigenvalue changes sign . at this point",
    "we have found @xmath10 for the given problem , and @xmath96 . we can then change a parameter such as @xmath23 or @xmath60 and repeat the procedure .",
    "this removes the need for any perturbative expansion .",
    "let us now put back in the magnetic field and cooperon self - energy corrections .",
    "the @xmath97 denominator in the eqn .",
