    "to describe phenomena like heavy ion collisions or the electroweak phase transition in the early universe , the methods of quantum field theory must be applied to finite densities and temperatures .",
    "the most reliable approach , especially for the case of qcd , are lattice calculations in euclidean space - time ( for a recent overview see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately the results are only applicable to equilibrium processes .",
    "dynamical processes in quantum field theory , on the other hand , are most commonly studied using perturbation theory . in theories with interacting massless degrees of freedom ,",
    "however , naive perturbation theory in powers of the coupling constant breaks down at high temperature due to infrared divergences caused by the exchange of massless modes . to obtain finite results",
    "one must resum classes of feynman diagrams which lead to dynamical mass generation and thus regulate the infrared singularities . to do this",
    "systematically one must disentangle the influence of different momentum scales ; in qcd at finite temperature , these are characterized by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 where the last two give the order of magnitude of the dynamical masses for the originally massless electric and magnetic gluonic modes , respectively . an improved one - loop perturbation scheme based on these principles , called hard thermal loop resummation ,",
    "was developed by braaten and pisarski @xcite ( see also @xcite for an overview ) . using effective field theory methods ,",
    "the above separation of the different momentum scales was achieved by braaten and nieto for static quantities at high temperature @xcite .    at high temperature",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that phenomena which are dominated by long wavelength modes can be reliably described by classical field theory .",
    "this is the basic motivation for the work presented here where we study the classical dynamics of the coupled yang - mills - higgs system .",
    "it is well known that the classical non - abelian gauge field equations are nonintegrable and exhibit dynamical chaos @xcite .",
    "therefore one has to rely on numerical methods to study the evolution of classical fields .    the real time evolution of classical su(@xmath3 ) yang - mills fields on a lattice , for @xmath4 ,",
    "was recently studied in ref .",
    "starting with randomly chosen initial conditions for the gauge fields on each lattice link it was found that the system shows chaotic behavior , i.e. the distance in phase space between two adjacent configurations increases exponentially in time . for systems with sufficiently weak coupling ,",
    "the time - averaged growth rate ( maximal lyapunov exponent ) @xmath5 was shown to scale linearly with the total energy of the system .",
    "the slope depends on the number @xmath3 .",
    "even if one starts with highly off - equilibrium configurations , the gauge fields thermalize very fast , i.e.  the energy distribution over the lattice soon exhibits a thermal shape .",
    "therefore the total energy of the system can be related to the associated temperature , and the scaling of the maximal lyapunov exponent with the total energy can be reinterpreted as a scaling with the temperature @xmath0  at least in the weak coupling regime .",
    "precisely the relation @xmath6 which connects dimensionless quantities was established . here",
    "@xmath7 is the lattice spacing and @xmath8 the coupling constant .",
    "one surmises that the actual value of the proportionality factor @xmath9 survives in the continuum limit @xmath10 .    for the classical su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge field systems , it was found in @xcite that the maximal lyapunov exponent coincides numerically with twice the damping rate @xmath11 of a gauge boson at rest as calculated quantum field theoretically @xcite using thermal perturbation theory with hard thermal loop resummation : @xmath12 at first sight it is surprising that the lyapunov exponent which is deduced from the classical field dynamics by an exact ( i.e. non - perturbative ) numerical simulation should be related at all with the plasmon damping rate which is calculated perturbatively in quantum field theory .",
    "however , the close relation between linear response functions calculated in the hard thermal loop approximation and classical transport phenomena has been known for many years @xcite , indicating that the hard thermal loops are essentially classical ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition it was argued in @xcite that the damping of a gluon and the exponential growth of the distance between two adjacent classical trajectories are related .",
    "so far there is , however , no rigorous proof for the relation ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "an empirical approach to the question whether the coincidence between the lyapunov exponent and ( twice ) the damping rate is only accidental would be to simulate other systems on the lattice and also calculate perturbatively their damping rates .",
    "a natural extension of the pure su(@xmath3 ) system is to couple it to a matter field . in this article",
    "we study the real - time evolution of the coupled su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs system .",
    "again we are interested in the thermalization properties and the chaoticity of the fields . to compare with the high temperature results from hard thermal loop calculations we concentrate on the symmetric phase ,",
    "i.e. we simulate the higgs behavior in the electroweak plasma above the phase transition in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "our work was partly motivated by the recent study presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the question of the connection between the damping rate and the lyapunov exponent in such a system was also addressed @xcite .",
    "this paper provides in particular the analytical results for the plasmon damping rates for the gluon and higgs fields in the hard thermal loop approximation . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the thermalization properties of the classical fields were not taken into account , and thus the determination of the temperature of the system was not dealt with in a satisfactory manner .",
    "the correct extraction of the temperature is , of course , crucial to establish relations like ( [ lyapscal ] ) .",

    "thus to satisfy gauss  law for all times we must only make sure that our initial conditions obey ( [ gauss ] ) .    for a study of the thermalization properties of the different degrees of freedom",
    "the energy transfer between different sectors of the system is an important quantity . as we will see below the energy transfer from the gauge part of the system to the higgs part",

    "the local higgs isospin current @xmath64 is defined in ( [ hj ] ) .",
    "we initialize the system in the same way as in @xcite by choosing random initial configurations :    * the isospin directions of the higgs fields , characterized by the angle variables @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 are chosen randomly for each lattice site . to keep control over the initial potential energy of the higgs fields",
    "the length of each higgs quaternion is _ not _ randomly chosen .",

    "the reason is that not only the isospin direction of the vector potential @xmath69 but also its amplitude enters the link variable @xmath37 as an angle variable .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath38 is connected to the amplitude while @xmath39 and @xmath40 characterize the isospin direction",
    ". therefore the latter two angles are initialized with random values on each link . to limit the initial magnetic energy we restrict the gauge field amplitude .",
    "thus we introduce a parameter @xmath70 which controls the initial magnetic energy and choose @xmath38 on each link randomly but within the range @xmath71 $ ] . for @xmath72",
    "the initial magnetic energy also vanishes . for small @xmath70 the relation @xmath73 holds . * to satisfy gauss law ( [ gauss ] ) in an easy way we choose initially vanishing field momenta on each link , i.e.  @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that the initial electric energy and the higgs kinetic energy , ( [ hel ] ) and ( [ hkin ] ) respectively , vanish .",
    "note that with non - vanishing potential but vanishing kinetic energies the system is initially in a highly off - equilibrium state .    when initialized in this way the system s further evolution is determined by the three parameters @xmath70 , @xmath45 , and @xmath58 , or by the initial magnetic energy and the initial higgs potential energy ( quadratic and quartic part ) , respectively .",
    "to make contact with perturbative calculations it is necessary to stay in the weak coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , weak coupling is required for the classical calculation to be a valid approximation to the full quantum treatment .",
    "this puts constraints on the range of the physical parameters @xmath75 .",
    "the scale invariance of the hamiltonian allows to fix the gauge coupling at @xmath76 and the lattice spacing at @xmath77 .",
    "weak coupling within the gauge sector is realized if the link variables are in the vicinity of unity ( cf .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) ) . in the initial state",
    "this is achieved by choosing @xmath70 small which implies that @xmath38 in ( [ rhog ] ) is small . on the other hand , as first noted in @xcite and recently worked out in @xcite , one encounters finite size artifacts in the pure su(2 ) system when using too small values of @xmath70 on a finite lattice .",
    "to explore the weak gauge coupling regime one is thus restricted to a window of not too small and not too large values for @xmath70 , or one must take very large lattices . with the latter option one soon runs into computer limitations .    from the hamiltonian ( [ hscal ] )",
    "one sees that weak coupling within the higgs sector is ensured if the quadratic terms dominate the quartic one .",
    "a system with weak higgs self coupling can thus be initialized by requiring @xmath78    to ensure weak coupling between the gauge and the higgs fields , the higgs isospin current @xmath79 in ( [ eome ] ) should be small compared to the magnetic energy contribution ) is @xmath80 . ] .",
    "estimating both contributions by the ( maximal ) field amplitudes we get the condition @xmath81    the continuum limit also puts constraints on the possible parameter ranges .",
    "first , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , to recover the continuum limit from the lattice formulation one needs @xmath82 . if the lattice simulations are supposed to yield a reasonable approximation to continuum behaviour , @xmath70 must therefore not be large .",
    "another lattice artifact shows up if the total energy in the system is too high . due to the compactness of the space of link variables the magnetic energy on the lattice ( [ hmag ] )",
    "is limited from above by @xmath83   = 24 n^3   \\ , .",
    "\\label{magmax}\\ ] ] if the total energy in the system is much larger than this value , equipartition of the energy among the magnetic , electric and higgs degrees of freedom may thus not be possible .",
    "all these considerations must be taken into account when selecting the initial parameters @xmath70 and @xmath45 as well as the value @xmath84 for the higgs self - coupling . in our calculations",
    "we have made sure to choose these parameters in such a way that we are simultaneously in the weak coupling regime and close to the continuum limit .      in the next section",
    "we will study the thermalization properties of systems initialized as described above .",
    "the self - thermalization of the fields is strongly influenced by the chaoticity in its dynamics which is characterized by a set of positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "we will here concentrate on the largest lyapunov exponent associated with the most unstable dynamical mode . in principle",
    "one can define two such exponents , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , for the gauge and higgs fields , respectively , by using two different distance measures in the space of field configurations .",
    "the first measures the growth rate of the euclidean distance in the gauge field sector , @xmath87 = \\sum\\limits_{x , i } \\sum\\limits_{\\alpha = 0}^3      \\left [ ( ( u_\\alpha)_{x , i } - ( u'_\\alpha)_{x , i } ) ^2       + ( ( \\dot u_\\alpha)_{x , i } - ( \\dot u'_\\alpha)_{x , i } ) ^2 \\right ] \\ , ,   \\label{gdist}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath88 denote the gauge fields associated with two solutions of the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) resulting from two initially very close field configurations .",
    "the other lyapunov exponent measures similarly the growth rate in the higgs sector , @xmath89 = \\sum\\limits_{x }     \\sum\\limits_{\\alpha = 0}^3     \\left [ ( ( \\phi_\\alpha)_{x } - ( \\phi'_\\alpha)_{x } ) ^2     + ( ( \\dot \\phi_\\alpha)_{x } - ( \\dot \\phi'_\\alpha)_{x } ) ^2 \\right ]   \\ , ,   \\label{hdist}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath90 are the corresponding higgs fields from the same two solutions .",
    "as we will see in the following , the two lyapunov exponents @xmath85 and @xmath86 turn out to be identical .    as usual",
    "the lyapunov exponent is defined as @xmath91 to avoid the problem of distance saturation @xcite in directly measuring the lyapunov exponent , we use the rescaling method for the evaluation of the large - time limit required in ( [ lyap_def ] ) ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in principle other definitions for the distance between field configurations are possible .",
    "in particular , one might wish to replace the higgs distance ( [ hdist ] ) by a gauge invariant definition like e.g. @xcite @xmath92 however , the euclidean distances defined above are more appropriate for the rescaling method . for the pure su(2 )",
    "gauge system it was carefully checked that different distance measures give rise to the same lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate various thermalization processes in the coupled su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs system .",
    "we will encounter different types of thermalization processes which operate on different time scales .",
    "in particular we find that , starting with the initialization described in sec .  [",
    "sec : form ] , the gauge and the higgs subsectors each thermalize rather rapidly , while the equipartition of energy between them requires a much longer time . in the following two subsections we first present results on the fast thermalization processes associated with the gauge and the higgs subsystems , and then discuss the system s long - time behaviour . for reasons given in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] our study is confined to certain parameter ranges which are consistent with weak coupling and proximity to the continuum limit .",
    "thermalization processes in a large system can be studied by following the evolution of the energy distribution over the microscopic degrees of freedom . in general",
    ", the distribution should approach that of a gibbs ensemble upon equilibrium . as shown in the cases of pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge fields @xcite , by measuring appropriate energy distributions , one can determine a parameter @xmath93 which we call the _ apparent temperature _ henceforth .",
    "the apparent temperature @xmath93 is related to the system s true temperature @xmath0 , but generally differs from @xmath0 , if the degrees of freedom of the system are not all independent , such as for a gauge theory .",
    "we will test the degree of thermalization in various subsectors of the system by comparing the distributions for the associated energies over the lattice with a boltzmann distribution @xmath94 here @xmath53 is the energy associated with the selected degrees of freedom ( e.g. the magnetic or electric energy of the gauge fields ) , and @xmath95 is an appropriate phase space factor , specified below .",

    "if this distribution has the boltzmann shape ( [ distri ] ) the system has lost all initial order in the distribution of @xmath53 , and the entropy has reached a maximum under the constraint of fixed total energy associated with the selected degrees of freedom .",
    "we will present measurements for four different energy distributions , the distribution @xmath99 for the electric energy @xmath100 of the gauge fields , the distribution @xmath101 of the magnetic energy @xmath102 , as well as the distributions @xmath103 and @xmath104 of the kinetic and potential energies of the higgs field , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , as defined in eqs .",

    "scale the kinetic ( dotted line ) and quadratic potential ( dot - dashed line ) parts of the higgs field energies also equilibrate , but at a much lower temperature @xmath120 .",
    "this indicates that in the coupled su(2 ) higgs system the gauge and the higgs subsector each undergo a separate , fast equilibration , starting from a highly off - equilibrium initial state .",
    "the approximate equality of the two associated relaxation times , @xmath121 for the gauge sector and @xmath122 for the higgs sector , can be easily understood if one makes the following two hypotheses : 1 .",
    "thermalization in a chaotic system is driven by the most unstable modes and thus dominated by its largest lyapunov exponent .",
    "the gauge and the higgs sectors are associated with the same largest lyapunov exponent . while it is difficult to find a rigorous proof for the first hypothesis , such a behaviour",
    "is intuitively expected .",
    "the second hypothesis can be checked in our simulation and is found to be correct ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : lyap ] ) .    at short times , each subsector settles down at a common temperature for all its degrees of freedom , but the temperatures of the two subsectors differ widely .",
    "this can be traced to the different initial energy content in the two subsectors . on average , the energy per degree of freedom in the gauge sector",
    "is initially 0.478 , while that in the higgs sector is only 0.060 .",
    "these specific values are , of course , a result of the parameters chosen in our initialization procedure .",
    "they would be different if other parameter values were selected .    the larger total gauge energy per gauge degree of freedom compared to the total higgs energy per higgs degree of freedom results in the higher temperature of the gauge sector .",
    "equilibration between the two subsectors apparently takes much longer .",
    "since both subsectors are apparently equally `` chaotic '' , the relative stability of the two temperatures of the subsystems indicates that energy exchange _ between _ the gauge and higgs sectors is suppressed .",
    "this will be discussed quantitatively in the following subsection .      as seen in fig .",

    "this is , however , still much longer than the time scales for the thermalization of the gauge and the higgs fields individually , which did not change appreciably compared to the case with the smaller value for @xmath45 .",
    "our main goal in this section is to determine from the numerical integration of the equations of motion the lyapunov exponents associated with the gauge and the higgs fields , and to relate them to the damping rates obtained in perturbative calculations at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the discussion of two technical issues .",
    "first , when determining the lyapunov exponent from the exponential growth of the distance between two initially nearby configurations , one can in principle use different distance measures . however , for all possible choices the exponential growth in the distance will be dominated by the eigenmode associated with the largest lyapunov exponent , which is unique to a dynamical system . unless the chosen distance measure accidentally projects out this most unstable mode , different distance measures should thus yield the same lyapunov exponent .",
    "( depending on the power with which the classical fields appear in the distance measure the actually measured growth rates can be different , but they are always related to the lyapunov exponent by a simple multiplicative constant . ) based on these remarks one expects the two distance measures given in ( [ gdist ] ) and ( [ hdist ] ) to yield the same lyapunov exponent .",
    "second , in order to relate results from numerical integration to those from perturbative calculations , we need to study the scaling behavior of the lyapunov exponents with the energy ( temperature ) of the system . for the pure su(2 )",
    "gauge system the relation @xmath150 was established @xcite , with @xmath151 denoting the gauge energy per plaquette . in @xcite",
    "it was shown by a perturbative calculation with hard thermal loop resummation that , at leading order in the coupling constant , in the coupled su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs system the damping rate of a static gauge boson is the same as that in pure su(2 ) gauge theory : @xmath152 for the higgs damping rate the relation @xmath153 was found @xcite to hold for small values of the higgs self coupling @xmath84 .    using the scaling law ( [ oneover6 ] ) together with the fact that in weak coupling the energy per plaquette @xmath154 can be linearly related to the temperature of the system",
    ", the authors of @xcite found that in the pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge systems the scaled largest lyapunov exponent coincides with twice the gauge boson damping rate .",
    "what should one expect in our case ? in ref .  @xcite it was speculated that here the gauge boson damping rate should be related with the lyapunov exponent extracted from the gauge distance measure ( [ gdist ] ) while the higgs boson damping rate could be connected with the lyapunov exponent extracted from the higgs distance measure ( [ hdist ] ) .",
    "since the numerical results did not support this expectation , the authors questioned the existence of a simple relationship between damping rates and lyapunov exponents in general , raising the possibility that the coincidence found in pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theory was a numerical accident .    since",
    ", however , the largest lyapunov exponent is related to the most unstable mode in the entire coupled system and thus , as discussed above , is picked up by essentially every distance measure one can choose , we argue that one should rather expect both measures to yield the same lyapunov exponent .",
    "we will show promptly that the numerical computations confirm this expectation .",
    "if this is the case the lyapunov exponent can be related with at most one of the two damping rates .",
    "since the gluon damping rate ( [ scaling_1 ] ) is much larger than the higgs damping rate ( [ higgsdamp ] ) it is clear that if there is such a relation it should be between the _ gluon _ damping rate and the maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "to which classically computable observable the smaller higgs damping rate can be related remains at this moment unclear .",
    "of course , it could also be that the lyapunov exponent is related to neither of the damping rates . to clarify this issue a careful study of the energy scaling of the lyapunov exponent is indispensible .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we show that , within the numerical accuracy , the two distance measures ( [ gdist ] ) and ( [ hdist ] ) indeed yield the same lyapunov exponent .",
    "( please note the suppressed zero on the vertical axis . )",
    "thus they both measure the largest lyapunov exponent of the entire coupled system .",
    "we also see that the lyapunov exponent shows a slight , but characteristic long - time variation which is the same for both distance measures .",
    "this behaviour will be further discussed below .    to understand the magnitude and physical meaning of the extracted lyapunov exponent",
    ", we studied its scaling behaviour with the energy contained in the system .",
    "to this end we varied the relative energy contents in the gauge and higgs subsectors as well as the total energy of the system , by changing @xmath70 and @xmath45 within the permitted ranges .",
    "we found that the lyapunov exponent ( which reflects the most unstable mode in the _ entire _ coupled system ) does not scale with the total energy of the entire system , but rather with the energy stored in the gauge subsector .",
    "these scaling tests were performed on the basis of numerical runs over a few hundred to a few thousand lattice time units . on these time",
    "scales the scaling of the largest lyapunov with the gauge field energy per plaquette was found to be accurate on the level of 5  10% .",
    "( note that in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] the lyapunov exponent shows long - time variations over a similar range of about 10% . )",
    "these findings indicate that the largest lyapunov exponent is associated which the gauge field dynamics , and that the chaoticity in the gauge sector dominates the dynamics of the entire system , including the equipartition between potential and kinetic energy contributions in the higgs subsystem .    returning to fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we can now discuss the magnitude of the lyapunov exponent scaled by the energy per plaquette @xmath154 in the gauge field sector .",
    "the lower part in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] shows that for very large times of order ten thousand lattice units the lyapunov exponent seems to converge to a constant value slightly above 0.16 .",
    "this is close to the value of about 1/6 which , according to the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , is expected ( see eq .",
    "( [ oneover6 ] ) ) if the lyapunov exponent is related to the gluon damping rate .",
    "the observed long - time variation of the lyapunov exponent with final convergence only after many thousand time steps is apparently connected with the already observed long - time variation of the relative energy content of the higgs and gauge field subsectors seen in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . as the gauge and higgs field sectors finally reach mutual equilibrium after several ten thousand lattice time units , the scaled lyapunov exponent @xmath155 settles down to a constant asymptotic value of approximately 1/6 .",
    "noting that @xmath156 after full equilibration and inserting @xmath76 , @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath157 which together with ( [ scaling_1 ] ) verifies ( [ scaling ] ) at the level of 10% .",
    "a more accurate verification is prohibited by the extremely slow equilibration between the gauge and higgs subsectors in our coupled system .",
    "the numerically determined lyapunov exponent is somewhat on the low side ; according to figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f2 ] , the magnitude of this discrepancy is directly related to the deviation of the gauge and higgs field energies from equipartition .",
    "let us summarize the findings from this section : we determined the gauge field lyapunov exponent and verified that for the yang - mills - higgs system it is related to the static gauge boson damping rate in the same way as for the pure gauge theory .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 , as defined in ( [ hdist ] ) and ( [ lyap_def ] ) , was shown to give the same lyapunov exponent and therefore to be governed by the gauge degrees of freedom , too .",
    "therefore @xmath86 can not be related to any specific dynamics of the higgs field , and it should not be called `` higgs lyapunov exponent '' as suggested in @xcite . in particular , it is not possible to establish a relation between @xmath86 and the higgs damping rate ( [ higgsdamp ] ) . unfortunately , we have not been able to come up with an alternative observable in the dynamics of classical fields which could be related to @xmath158 .",
    "we close this paper with a discussion of our results in comparison with the recent work presented in @xcite . for small values of the higgs self coupling @xmath84 , bir and",
    "thoma @xcite found that the lyapunov exponents @xmath86 and @xmath85 deduced from the higgs and gauge fields , respectively , agree within the numerical accuracy .",
    "for very large values of the higgs self coupling , on the other hand , @xmath86 was found to decrease , thereby breaking the coincidence between @xmath86 and @xmath85 .",
    "for the case of small @xmath58 we have verified the coincidence of @xmath86 and @xmath85 .",
    "it has a natural explanation since , as we already discussed , in principle any distance measure between two neighboring trajectories in phase space simply yields the maximal lyapunov exponent of the entire system .    in view of this argument",
    ", the disagreement between @xmath86 and @xmath85 at large @xmath58 at first seems surprising .",
    "if , however , the distance measure projects out the eigenmode with the largest lyapunov exponent , it can yield a different value for the growth rate .",
    "this is apparently what happens at very large values of @xmath58 for the higgs distance ( [ gidist ] ) used in @xcite : as already pointed out in @xcite , for large @xmath58 the dynamics of the higgs amplitude ( [ defhiggsamp ] ) becomes completely determined by the quartic self - interaction term ( [ elambda ] ) , thereby effectively freezing the higgs field amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "thus this degree of freedom starts to decouple from the rest of the system , and it may happen that the growth of perturbations in the higgs amplitude is no longer influenced by the maximal lyapunov exponent associated with the gauge field , at least , over the time scale used for the determination of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we have not studied here the case of large @xmath58 , for the following reasons : first , if one increases @xmath58 without decreasing the higgs amplitude one leaves the perturbative regime ( [ weakcouph ] ) .",
    "then the computed lyapunov exponents can no longer be compared with the damping rates from hard thermal loop calculations .",
    "second , for very large @xmath58 the energy density of the quartic interaction term ( [ elambda ] ) and thus also the total energy density become very large . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : iwc ] , in this case one runs into lattice artifacts due to the compactness of the magnetic energy on the lattice .",
    "while we agree with bir and thoma @xcite about the coincidence of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we disagree with their determination of the temperature .",
    "consequently we also differ in the interpretation of their results with respect to their connection with perturbative damping rates , believing that their rather negative conclusions are not justified .",
    "bir and thoma @xcite use the stefan - boltzmann law for 10 degrees of freedom @xmath159 to extract the temperature @xmath0 from the total energy density @xmath160 of the system .",
    "here we put in @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 explicitly ( elsewhere we take @xmath164 ) . as can be seen from the occurrence of planck s constant in ( [ stefbol ] ) , this law makes explicit use of the quantized nature of excitation energies in a gas of ( massless ) particles . as such it",
    "can not be applied to a classical field theory .",
    "the classical yang - mills - higgs fields on the lattice correspond to a dynamical system of coupled anharmonic oscillators which in thermal equilibrium and for weak coupling obeys the relation @xmath165 thus the energy per degree of freedom is directly proportional to the temperature , and not to its fourth power .",
    "even more crucial is our finding that the whole system equilibrates only after a very long time . since the authors of @xcite did not use the rescaling method for extracting the lyapunov exponents , they ran very soon into the problem of distance saturation due to the compactness of the gauge group @xcite , and thus their analysis was necessarily restricted to times which were short compared to the mutual equilibration time between the gauge and higgs sectors .",
    "if the lyapunov exponent is determined on such short time scales , the total energy of the system does not tell anything about the temperature of the relevant gauge subsector no matter whether it is determined from ( [ stefbol ] ) or ( [ harmos ] ) . for this reason bir and thoma missed the specific connection of the lyapunov exponent with the gauge subsystem rather than with the entire coupled yang - mills - higgs system . only an analysis like the one presented here",
    "can uncover the fact that after very short thermalization times one can cleanly define separate temperatures for the gauge and the higgs subsystems , and that the maximal lyapunov exponent actually scales with the temperature of the gauge sector already long before global equilibration between the gauge and higgs sectors sets in .    in conclusion , we have studied the high temperature behavior of the coupled yang - mills - higgs system in the weak coupling regime close to the continuum limit .",
    "we found that the coupled system undergoes thermalization in stages : while the gauge and higgs subsectors self - thermalize very rapidly , equipartition of the energy between these two sectors takes several orders of magnitude longer .",
    "we expect and have qualitative evidence for a connection between the rapid thermalization time scale within each of the two subsectors and the magnitude of the largest lyapunov exponent ; to establish this relation quantitatively requires , however , a much more detailed and computer - intensive investigation . since we found that the largest lyapunov exponent is associated with the gauge field and scales with the gauge field energy , we conclude that thermalization of both the gauge and higgs subsectors is driven by the chaotic dynamics of classical non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "the higgs subsector thus thermalizes via its coupling to the chaotic gauge fields ( gluon heat bath ) and not due its own intrinsic non - linearity via the selfcoupling @xmath58 .",
    "the scaling of the lyapunov exponent with the gauge field energy was used to verify that , even in the presence of a coupling to matter fields , the largest lyapunov exponent still agrees with twice the damping rate of a static gauge boson .",
    "the analytical results of thoma and bir @xcite from thermal perturbation theory show that in the coupled yang - mills - higgs system also the higgs damping rate is proportional to @xmath2 and thus , from the general arguments given e.g. in @xcite , is expected to survive in the classical limit . at the moment it remains an open question whether it is possible to identify an observable in the dynamical evolution of classical yang - mills - higgs fields which can be associated with the higgs boson damping rate in a similar way as the largest lyapunov exponent is related to the gluon damping rate .",

    "then it is straightforward to derive @xmath212 from which we obtain @xmath213 .    in principle ,",
    "perturbative corrections to the results obtained in ( [ pelres ] ) , ( [ pmag2 ] ) , and ( [ phiggs ] ) can be calculated . for our case at hand , however , it turns out that the formulae derived above are in good agreement with the numerical results .",
    "this is not surprising because our numerical calculations are performed for weak coupling .",
