    "the branching random walk is a process which serves as a model for a population living in a spatially structured environment ( the vertices of a graph @xmath3 ) .",
    "each individual lives in a vertex , breeds and dies at random times and each offspring is placed ( according to some rule ) in one of the neighbouring vertices .",
    "since for the branching random walk ( brw in short ) there is no bound on the number of individuals allowed per site , it is natural to consider a modification of the process , namely the multitype contact process , where , for some @xmath4 , no more than @xmath2 particles per site are allowed ( if @xmath5 one gets the usual contact process ) .",
    "the multitype contact processes are more realistic models , indeed instead of thinking of the vertices of the graph as small portions of the ecosystem where individuals may pile up indefinitely ( like in the brw ) , here each vertex can host at most @xmath2 individuals .",
    "this is in particular true for patchy habitats ( each vertex represents a patch of soil ) or in host - symbionts interactions ( each vertex represents a host on top of which symbionts may live ) , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the need for more realistic models also brings random environment into consideration .",
    "brws in random environment has been studied by many authors ( see for instance @xcite ) . in many cases",
    "the random environment is a random choice of the reproduction law of the process ( in some cases there is no death ) . in our case",
    "we put the randomness into the underlying graph .",
    "when choosing @xmath3 , @xmath0 is perhaps the first choice that comes to mind but other graphs are reasonable options .",
    "in particular the brw and the contact process have been studied also on trees ( @xcite ) and on random graphs as galton - watson trees ( @xcite ) .",
    "although @xmath0 has clear properties of regularity , which make it a nice case to study , random graphs are believed to serve as a better model for real - life structures and social networks .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate the behaviour of stochastic processes on random graphs , which possibly retain some regularity properties which make them treatable .",
    "an example is the small world , which is the space model in @xcite and @xcite , where each vertex has the same number of neighbours .",
    "the percolation cluster of @xmath6 given by a supercritical bernoulli percolation , which we denote by @xmath7 , has no such regularity , but has a `` stochastic '' regularity and its geometry , if viewed at a large scale , does not differ too much from @xmath0 ( for instance it is true that , for large @xmath8 , in many @xmath8-boxes of @xmath9 , there are open paths crossing the box in each direction and these paths connect to crossing paths in neighbouring boxes , see ( * ? ? ? * chapter 7 ) ) .",
    "indeed @xmath7 shares many stochastic properties with @xmath0 : the simple random walk is recurrent in @xmath10 , transient in @xmath11 and the transition probabilities have the same space - time asymptotics as those of @xmath0 ( with different constants , @xcite ) ; two walkers collide infinitely many often in @xmath10 and finitely many times in @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) ; the voter model clusters in @xmath10 and coexists in @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) ; just to mention a few facts .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare the critical parameters of the brw and of the multitype contact process on the infinite percolation cluster @xmath7 with the corresponding ones on @xmath0 ( from now on we tacitly assume that the infinite cluster exists almost surely , that is that the underlying bernoulli percolation is supercritical ) . in order to define these parameters ,",
    "let us give a formal definition of the processes involved .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 if and only if @xmath14 .",
    "we require that there exists @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . given @xmath18 , the @xmath19-_branching random",
    "walk _ ( @xmath19-brw or , when @xmath19 is not relevant , brw ) is the continuous - time markov process @xmath20 , with configuration space @xmath21 , where each existing particle at @xmath22 has an exponential lifespan of parameter 1 and , during its life , breeds at the arrival times of a poisson process of parameter @xmath23 and then chooses to send its offspring to @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 .",
    "thus we associate to @xmath26 a family of brws , indexed by @xmath19 . with a slight abuse of notation , we will say that @xmath27 is a brw ( @xmath28 represents the rate at which existing particles at @xmath22 breed in @xmath24 ) .",
    "the brw is called _ irreducible _ if and only if the underlying graph is connected .",
    "clearly , any brw on @xmath0 or @xmath1 is irreducible ; we note that in their graph structure we possibly admit loops , that is , every vertex might be a neighbour of itself ( thus allowing reproduction from a vertex onto itself ) .",
    "if @xmath29 is a subgraph of @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath30 the map @xmath31 .",
    "the associated brw @xmath32 , indexed by @xmath19 , is called the _ restriction _ of @xmath27 to @xmath33 and , to avoid cumbersome notation , we denote it by @xmath34 .",
    "two critical parameters are associated to the continuous - time brw : the weak ( or global ) survival critical parameter @xmath35 and the strong ( or local ) survival one @xmath36 .",
    "they are defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a fixed vertex , @xmath39 is the configuration with no particles at all sites and @xmath40 is the law of the process which starts with one individual in @xmath38 .",
    "note that , if the brw is irreducible , then these values do not depend on the choice of @xmath38 nor on the initial configuration , provided that this configuration is finite ( that is , it has only a finite number of individuals ) .",
    "when there is no dependence on @xmath38 , we simply write @xmath36 and @xmath35 .",
    "these parameters depend on @xmath27 : when we need to stress this dependence , we write @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we refer the reader to section  [ sec : prelim ] for how to compute the explicit value of these parameters .    given @xmath27 and a nonincreasing function @xmath43 , the _",
    "restrained branching random walk _",

    "restrained branching random walks have been introduced in @xcite in order to provide processes where the natural competition for resources in an environmental patch is taken into account ( since @xmath48 is nonincreasing , the more individuals are present at a vertex , the more difficult it is for new individuals to be born there ) .",
