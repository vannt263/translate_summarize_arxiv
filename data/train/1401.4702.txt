    "dispersive coupling of a quantum system to a mechanical or electromagnetic cavity mode has been attracting much attention recently .",
    "the coupling provides a means for quantum nondemolition measurement of the occupation number of the mode or of the populations in the energy levels of the system @xcite .",
    "the underlying read - out mechanism is the shift of the mode frequency or the system transition frequency , which depends on the state populations of the system or the mode , respectively . in the dispersive regime ,",
    "a measurement erases information about the quantum phase , but does not cause transitions between energy levels .",
    "however , such transitions can happen due to coupling to a thermal reservoir , and also if the mode and/or the system are modulated by external fields .",
    "it is well understood that , through dispersive coupling , thermal interstate transitions cause decoherence @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the effects of periodic modulation and the interplay of the modulation and dephasing due to the coupling to a thermal reservoir .    in this paper",
    "we address these problems .",
    "we consider a mode @xmath0 ( a harmonic oscillator ) coupled to a dynamical system @xmath1 .",
    "the mode and the system are also coupled to separate thermal reservoirs and can be modulated by periodic fields .",
    "the couplings and the modulation are assumed weak in the sense that the coupling energy is small compared to the interlevel energy spacing . in other words ,",
    "the widths of the energy levels and the rabi energies are small compared to the level spacing .",
    "the modulation is assumed to be nearly resonant and will be described in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .    in distinction from the celebrated jaynes - cummings model @xcite , here",
    "the level spacings of the mode and the system are significantly different . for a dispersive @xmath2 coupling the major effect",
    "is not energy exchange , but rather it is the change of the level spacing depending on the state population , which occurs already in the first order in the coupling constant .",
    "semiclassically , this situation can give rise to multistability in the response to a modulating field as follows .    for given modulating field parameters , the combined system may self - consistently support either large amplitude forced vibrations of mode @xmath3 , with the effective mode frequency tuned into good resonance with the driving field via the dispersive coupling , or small amplitude vibrations with an effective mode frequency far from resonance with the driving field . in each case",
    ", the vibration amplitude of mode @xmath3 sets the transition frequencies of the system @xmath1 .",
    "if system @xmath1 is modulated itself , this determines its quasi - steady - state level occupations . through the dispersive coupling",

    "fluctuations_. classical and quantum fluctuations unavoidably come along with relaxation as a consequence of coupling to a bath . in multistable systems ,",
    "fluctuations cause interstate switching , _ even at zero temperature_.    interestingly , where the dispersive coupling is weak , there is obviously no multistability ; however , where it is strong there is also no multistability , because the switching rate becomes comparable to the relaxation rate , and then the very notion of multistability becomes meaningless . in what follows",
    "we find the appropriate range of the coupling strength .",
    "we provide a general formulation of a mean - field theory and a theory of the switching rates in the important case where the typical relaxation time @xmath15 of the system @xmath1 is much smaller than the relaxation time @xmath16 of the mode .      formally , the dispersive coupling hamiltonian @xmath17 is a function of a mode operator @xmath18 and a system operator @xmath19 , which commute with the isolated mode and system hamiltonians , respectively , in the absence of modulation .",
    "for example , @xmath18 can be the occupation number of the mode , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the lowering and raising operators , while , if the dynamical system is a spin in a static magnetic field @xmath23 , @xmath24 can be the spin operator @xmath25 .",
    "this form of coupling assures that @xmath26 is independent of time in the interaction representation .    for illustration",

    "the condition on @xmath35 in particular justifies the approximation where only dispersive coupling is taken into consideration .",
    "the simplest form of the dispersive coupling of a mode and a tls is @xmath36 , which we now consider .",
    "we switch to the interaction representation using the unitary transformation @xmath37 . disregarding the fast - oscillating ( counter - rotating ) terms proportional to the modulation",

    ", we found a regime where the compound system can have up to three stable states .",
    "our analysis refers to the case where the relaxation rate of the system is large compared to the mode relaxation rate .",
    "this case is of utmost interest for the broad range of currently studied compound systems .",
    "here we discuss a few examples from the literature , which may naturally satisfy the conditions under which our description applies .",
    "* _ example 1 _ : double quantum dot charge qubit coupled to superconducting cavity mode .",
    "such a system was studied in ref .",
    ", with mode frequency @xmath389  ghz , mode lifetime @xmath390  s , qubit transition frequency @xmath391  ghz , qubit lifetime @xmath392  s , and jaynes - cummings coupling strength @xmath393  mhz . here",
    "the cavity mode quality factor was only @xmath394 , already giving @xmath395 . with expected device improvements",
    "the condition @xmath396 will be reached .",
    "the dispersive coupling @xmath42 in our theory can be tuned via the qubit - cavity detuning @xmath397 , giving e.g.  @xmath398 , which easily satisfies the weak noise condition @xmath399 . * _ example 2 _ : superconducting `` transmon '' qubit coupled to a superconducting stripline cavity mode . in the recent experiment described in ref .  , the parameter values are : @xmath400 ghz , @xmath401  ns , @xmath402  ghz , @xmath403  ns , and jaynes - cummings coupling @xmath404  mhz .",
    "the condition @xmath405 is weakly satisfied .",
    "the value of the dispersive coupling @xmath42 in our model is approximately equal to the `` qubit - qubit coupling '' @xmath406  mhz .",
    "this gives @xmath407 , though the lifetimes and @xmath42 can be presumably decreased .",
    "interestingly , this setup features two qubits coupled to the same cavity mode , allowing the possibility for studying the case where the system @xmath1 has more than just two levels .",
    "* _ example 3 _ : cooper pair box qubit coupled to a nanomechanical resonator .",
    "a device of this type was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform a nanomechanical measurement of the qubit state , with parameters : @xmath408  mhz , @xmath409s , @xmath410  ghz , @xmath411  khz .",
    "the qubit relaxation time @xmath412 was not measured , but from similar devices it can be expected to be of order @xmath413  ns . thus both the adiabaticity condition @xmath414 and the weak noise limit @xmath415 are easily satisfied .",
    "we have shown that quantum fluctuations in the system dispersively coupled to the mode cause switching between coexisting stable states .",
    "the switching rates are explicitly calculated in the most interesting region , i.e. , near bifurcation point where metastable states disappear .",
    "we find that the effective switching activation energy displays power - law scaling with the distance to the bifurcation point , with exponent 3/2 .",
    "this analysis holds in the regime of weak quantum noise , quantified by the parameter combination @xmath399 .    going beyond the limit described above",
    ", we also expect that the system displays interesting behavior where the condition that the quantum noise is weak is violated . in this case quantum noise",
    "leads to unusually large fluctuations between the areas centered near the mean - field stable states .",
    "such behavior may be manifested in some of the systems described above . in other words ,",
    "the system becomes an amplifier of the nonequilibrium quantum noise .",
    "a detailed analysis of this effect is beyond the scope of the present paper , but is a worthwhile direction for future study .",
