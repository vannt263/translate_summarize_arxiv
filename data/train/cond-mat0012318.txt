    "spin dependent electronic transport phenomena in semiconductor nanostructures are extensively studied in recent years , with motivations to develop novel electronic and optical devices based on carrier spin dynamics such as spin transistors @xcite , polarization dependent optical modulators , and even quantum computers .",
    "recent experimental progress in transporting electronic spins @xcite over the distance of 100 @xmath1 m and injecting spins@xcite from ferromagnetic materials to compound semiconductors has been accelerating the prospect of these devices .    charge transport is extensively studied to understand the operations of devices . in the conventional devices where the electron distribution is spatially homogeneous and the electrons move in the same direction irrespective of spin directions ,",
    "the charge transport is expressed in terms of drift mobilities .",
    "when an electronic band is parabolic and umklapp processes are negligible , electron - electron ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) scatterings do not directly affect mobilities since the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering conserves the total momentum of the system .",
    "@xcite it influences the charge transport only indirectly by modifying momentum distribution functions and screening other scattering processes of electrons .",
    "mobility is determined by @xmath0-phonon and @xmath0-ionized impurity scatterings . in high - quality , modulation - doped heterostructures of iii - v semiconductors , electron mobility increases as temperature decreases and reaches the maximum value limited by the scattering with remote dopants.@xcite    in contrast to the charge transport , spin - up electrons move against spin - down electrons or vice versa in the spin transport .",
    "thus , in addition to @xmath0-ionized impurity scattering , we expect that the coulomb interaction between spin - up and -down electrons also contributes to the spin transport.@xcite ( the coulomb interaction between two electrons with the same spin direction does not directly influence the spin transport as it conserves the spin current . ) as we show later , the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction is as important as the @xmath0-ionized impurity scattering to the spin transport .",
    "the spin transport is also influenced by the many - particle effects of interacting electrons .",
    "an electronic band dispersion is renormalized , giving the effective mass of an electron somewhat different from the band effective mass , and the bare coulomb interaction is screened , leading to the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction with a finite range .",
    "these many - particle effects affect collision dynamics and modify transport coefficients .",
    "the many - particle effects also have consequences on spin dynamics itself .",
    "the spin axis of a noninteracting particle precesses around external magnetic field @xmath2 . in the interacting system",
    ", each electron feels effective magnetic field @xmath3 due to the molecular field of surrounding electrons .",
    "the effective field is related ( almost proportional ) to the local spin density and parallel to its direction as explicitly shown in our analysis below .",
    "thus in a spin polarized electron gas , a spin axis precesses around @xmath4 .",
    "this induces a `` spin - rotation term '' in the equation of motion for the spin current , leading to a anomalous spin diffusion coefficients and spin waves,@xcite which were experimentally observed in @xmath5he , @xmath5he-@xmath6he mixture , and in atomic hydrogen.@xcite    in this paper we present a theory and numerical calculations of spin diffusion coefficients in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) interacting through the coulomb force . in our previous publication@xcite",
    "we adopted the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) to incorporate the many - particle effects in the lowest order . here",
    "we adopt the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to improve the treatment on many - particle aspects of electrons and obtain more reliable numerical results .",
    "we compare the contributions from @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering and @xmath0-ionized impurity scattering to the spin diffusion in semiconductor heterostructures and discuss their relative importance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , our calculation scheme is briefly described . in sec .",
    "iii the numerical results for the spin transport coefficients are shown with detailed discussions .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the differences in mathematical expressions from our previous calculation are summarized in appendix .",
    "our theoretical model is already presented in our previous publication @xcite and we describe it only briefly here .",
    "several relevant expressions arising from the rpa will be given in the appendix .",
    "we consider two - dimensional electrons interacting through the coulomb interactions .",
    "other interactions such as electron - phonon , electron - ionized impurity or the exchange interaction of electrons with magnetic impurities are not included in the present study .",
    "we assume that electronic spins are polarized in the growth direction , @xmath7-axis ( normal to the 2d plane ) , in the quasi - thermal equilibrium , and a direction of local spin polarization can be slightly tipped away from @xmath7-axis by applying r.f .",
    "field or by external spin injection .",
    "the total sheet density of spin - up and spin - down electrons , @xmath8 , is assumed to be spatially and temporally constant , and the spin density , @xmath9 , varies slowly on a hydrodynamic scale.@xcite the spin polarization is given by @xmath10 .",
    "spin relaxation is not included in the present analysis .",
    "a moderate external magnetic field , @xmath2 , can be applied perpendicular to the 2d plane .",
    "we assume that the field is so weak that it only affects spinor space , leaving electron orbital motion intact .",
    "otherwise the orbital motion is quantized into the landau levels , and the system turns into the quantized hall state , to which our present theory does not apply .",
    "the estimation in our earlier work@xcite shows that the _ weak field condition _ is satisfied when @xmath11 1 t. when this condition is satisfied , the external field can trivially be erased from the theory by using a rotating frame .    the quantum transport equation for the electron distribution functions @xmath12 is given by@xcite @xmath13 \\cr = \\left ( { \\partial \\underline n_p(\\bbox{\\rm r},t ) }   \\over { \\partial t } \\right ) _ { col.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the electron energy @xmath14 and the distribution function @xmath12 are 2@xmath152 matrices in spinor space , denoted by underlining .",
    "the diagonal components of @xmath12 represent the population of spin - up and spin - down electrons and its off - diagonal elements represent the couplings between spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "the transport equation is similar to the boltzmann equation except that there are anticommutators in the drift terms ( the second and the third term on the left ) and a commutator in the last term on the left .",
    "this term in the commutator is called the `` spin - rotation term '' , representing the effect of the external and molecular fields .",
    "the electron ( quasiparticle ) energy @xmath14 is composed of a kinetic energy term , a coupling to the external field and a self - energy caused by the presence of other electrons . in our earlier",
    "work,@xcite we adopted the hfa to calculate an electron self - energy since the simple analytic expressions of the hfa considerably reduces the load of numerical calculations .",
    "but the hfa does not describe the many - particle properties of 2deg appropriately : the energy dispersion of a quasiparticle is not given properly with a vanishing quasiparticle effective mass at fermi surface due to the infinite range of the bare coulomb interaction . since the effective mass is one of the important parameters in our theory , a certain degree of arbitrariness exists in our previous calculations . and",
    "since the hfa does not include correlation terms , the self - energy for a spin - up electron does not contain the contribution from spin - down electrons .",
    "this leads us to an unrealistic situation when the spin polarization is high , i.e. , provided that we prepared 2deg with all spins pointing downward , and we put a spin - up electron into this 2deg , then the energy dispersion of this spin - up electron remains that of a noninteracting electron in spite of the presence of many spin - down electrons .",
    "this prevented us from calculating the diffusion coefficients of highly polarized 2deg in our earlier work .    in the present study",
    "we improve our calculation by adopting the rpa .",
    "it takes into account exchange and correlation ( though not completely ) , and we can correct the problems of the hfa mentioned above .",
    "the rpa self - energy for an electron gas is discussed in many text books ( e.g. , see ref . and ) , and its detailed expressions for a two - dimensional , multi - band electron system are given by vinter@xcite and dassarma _ et .",
    "al_.@xcite we use the standard rpa self - energy without vertex corrections . the matsubara function ( imaginary time green s function ) for the self - energy , which is a 2@xmath152 matrix in spinor space ,",
    "is written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are indices for spin , @xmath19 is the noninteracting electron propagator .",
    "( @xmath19 is finite only when @xmath20 . )",
    "the rpa screened coulomb interaction @xmath21 satisfies the dyson equation , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bare coulomb interaction . the lowest order polarization ( bubble diagram )",
    "is finite only when @xmath24 , given by @xmath25 the real - time functions are obtained by the analytic continuation after the momentum integration and the summation over matsubara frequencies .",
    "the quasiparticle energy dispersion is obtained from the real part of the self - energy following the prescription suggested by rice.@xcite    in fig .",
    "1 we show energy - momentum dispersions of spin - up and -down electrons in 2deg with spin - polarizations @xmath26 0.1  0.9 and with total electron sheet density at 2 @xmath15 @xmath27 cm @xmath28 .",
    "the electron energy is measured relative to the zero of the noninteracting electron dispersion .",
    "one of the important many - particle effects in the interacting electrons is the reduction of one - electron energy ( bandgap renormalization ) .",
    "since @xmath29 , the renormalization is larger in the spin - up electron .",
    "the energy differences between the spin - up and the spin - down electron increase with spin polarizations . when @xmath30 0.5 , the energy dispersions of both spin - up and -down electrons are well approximated by parabolic band dispersions .",
    "we obtained the quasiparticle effective mass @xmath31 between 1.11@xmath32 and 1.19@xmath32 depending on spin polarizations .",
    "( @xmath32 is a band effective mass .",
    "we used @xmath33 for the conduction band of gaas . ) in numerical computations of transport coefficients , we have used the parabolic band approximation for the energy dispersions .",
    "the quantum transport equation eq.([quantumtransport ] ) is solved by the chapman - enskog expansion to the lowest order using variational solutions.@xcite the final expression of the equation for the spin current is obtained by multiplying the transport equation by the particle velocity and integrating over the momentum as,@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a spin current representing the flow of the spin component @xmath36 in the spatial direction @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a unit vector in the direction of spin polarization , and @xmath39 .",
    "the factor @xmath40 , which is a function of @xmath41 , represents the contribution of the molecular field , and @xmath42 is a gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath40 will be given in the appendix .",
    "we show the results of numerical calculations for spin diffusion coefficients .",
    "since a spin current is a tensor defined by the two vectors ; the direction of spatial flow and the direction of spin , we should distinguish longitudinal ( @xmath45 ) and transverse ( @xmath46 ) spin diffusion coefficients .",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 ) in the longitudinal spin diffusion , consider the system where the direction of spin polarization is aligned in @xmath7 everywhere but its magnitude has gradient in the direction @xmath47 .",
    "then the longitudinal spin current flows in the spatial direction @xmath47 whose spin direction is in @xmath7 , parallel to the spin polarization .",
    "while in the transverse spin diffusion , consider the system where the magnitude of spin polarization is the same everywhere but its direction is tilted gradually from @xmath7 to @xmath47 by a small angle when we go from @xmath48 to @xmath49 . in this case the transverse spin current flows in the spatial direction @xmath47 with the spin direction in @xmath47 , perpendicular to the spin polarization .",
    "these two diffusions show different magnitudes and temperature dependence.@xcite    the temperature dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is plotted in fig . 3 and 4 , respectively , with 0.01 @xmath50 0.5 .",
    "we calculate in the degenerate region , @xmath51 20 k. the fermi temperature is 83 k in the unpolarized 2deg with the sheet density 2 @xmath15 10@xmath52 cm@xmath28 ( fermi wave number @xmath54 = 0.112 nm@xmath55 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the diffusion coefficients are somewhat larger than those calculated previously in ref .",
    "but their temperature dependencies are identical .",
    "we believe that the present results calculated with the rpa should be more accurate in predicting the transport coefficients . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath45 increases at low temperatures and diverges as @xmath56 when @xmath57 approaches zero .",
    "a close inspection shows it deviates slightly from @xmath56 dependence ( bulging downward ) .",
    "actually we find @xmath58 as expected of the `` normal '' transport coefficient in 2d degenerate fermions .",
    "( the logarithmic correction factor is characteristic of a 2d system .",
    "@xcite ) while in fig . 4 , @xmath46 increases in the higher temperatures in a similar manner as @xmath45 , but it departs from @xmath56 dependence and becomes constant as @xmath59 at the larger @xmath60 .",
    "the different temperature dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is attributed to the phase space available in the collisions of two diffusion processes . in the longitudinal spin diffusion ,",
    "a close inspection of the associated collision term shows that electrons in the vicinity of the fermi surface within the width @xmath61 only are allowed to participate in the collision due to the kinematics and the pauli exclusion .",
    "thus as the temperature is lowered , the number of electrons participate in the collision decreases , leading to the reduction of a collision rate . while in the transverse case",
    ", all electrons between the two fermi surfaces of the spin - up and -down electrons participate in the collision .",
    "thus the larger the spin polarization is , the more electrons are involved in the collision , leading to the finite and constant diffusion coefficients at @xmath59 .",
    "this anomalous temperature dependence is observed experimentally in @xmath5he-@xmath6he system.@xcite      in the previous subsection we have discussed the spin diffusion of 2deg in the presence of @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering alone .",
    "the spin diffusion in actual samples of heterostructures and quantum wells ( qws ) should also be affected by other scattering processes . in heterostructures of iii - v semiconductors , a low temperature electron _",
    ", @xmath62 , is dominated by the scattering with remote ionized impurities ( dopants ) .",
    "we expect that the @xmath0-impurity scattering will also strongly influence the spin transport .",
    "we compare the spin diffusion coefficients limited by @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering which we have calculated above with those limited by @xmath0-impurity scattering , and show that the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering bears substantial contribution to the spin transport in actual sample structures , although the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering has only an indirect consequence to the _ charge _ transport . we do not give the explicit calculations of the spin diffusion including the @xmath0-impurity scattering but we estimate its magnitude from experimental carrier mobilities .",
    "the highest mobility reported so far in gaas / algaas heterostructures exceeds 1 @xmath15 10@xmath63 @xmath64 v@xmath55 s@xmath55 below 1 k.@xcite the _ charge _ diffusion coefficient @xmath65 arising from @xmath0-impurity scattering is related to the mobility @xmath62 through the generalized einstein s relation.@xcite for a degenerate system , we have @xmath66 where @xmath1 is a chemical potential . in the high quality samples cited above , the charge diffusion coefficient @xmath65 is estimated to be 9 @xmath15 10@xmath6 @xmath64 s@xmath55 below 10 k. assuming that the magnitude of the _ spin _ diffusion limited by @xmath0-impurity scattering is similar to the charge diffusion , we obtain the estimated value of 9 @xmath15 10@xmath6 @xmath64 s@xmath55 for the spin diffusion , which is , compared with fig .",
    "3 , close to the spin diffusion limited by @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering at the lowest temperatures .",
    "thus the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering has a significant contribution to the spin diffusion , comparable to the @xmath0-impurity scattering . in moderate - quality samples with @xmath67 1 @xmath15 10@xmath68 @xmath64 v@xmath55 s@xmath55 , the relative weight of @xmath0-ionized impurity scattering should become larger than that of @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering .      in a many - electron system",
    "an individual electron interacts with surrounding electrons through the coulomb interaction .",
    "this effect is represented in the fermi liquid theory that an electron is subject to a molecular ( mean ) field produced by surrounding electrons .",
    "due to the exchange part of the interaction , the energy of an individual electron depends on the spin directions of itself and neighboring electrons .",
    "thus the molecular field acts as an effective magnetic field @xmath69 to the individual electron , and its spin precesses around @xmath69 .",
    "the consequence of @xmath69 was first pointed out by leggett and rice@xcite that the effective transverse spin diffusion coefficients measured by spin echo experiments should depend on the spin - tipping angle by the initial r.f .",
    "pulse ( leggett - rice effect ) . the anomalous behavior of the transverse spin diffusion and the spin waves discussed in our previous publication@xcite have its physical origin in the precession of flowing spins around the effective magnetic field .",
    "consequences of the effective magnetic field can be seen explicitly in the last two terms on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ equationforj ] ) , @xmath70 .",
    "the second term expresses the spin precession around the external magnetic field , while the first term represents the spin precession around the effective magnetic field .",
    "the effective field is parallel to spin density @xmath71 , and its magnitude depends on @xmath40 and @xmath72 .",
    "we should notice that the precession occurs not on the spin density but on the spin current @xmath73 , _ i.e. _ , the precession occurs on an electron flowing into the region with its spin direction slightly tipped away from the local spin density .",
    "( if the direction of @xmath71 is constant throughout the system , the effective field @xmath69 has no net effect . ) in fig .",
    "5 we plot the magnitude of the effective field in terms of spin splitting energy , @xmath74 [ ev ] , ( or the larmor precession frequency ) as a function of spin polarization @xmath75 .",
    "the spin splitting shows a sublinear dependence on the spin polarization since @xmath40 decreases with @xmath60 .",
    "we have calculated spin diffusion coefficients of 2des interacting through the coulomb force .",
    "the improved approximation in the rpa leads to a more precise treatment of many - particle aspects of the electron properties compared with our earlier calculations using the hfa .",
    "the magnitudes of both the longitudinal and the transverse spin diffusion coefficients are larger than our previous calculations but their temperature dependencies are qualitatively similar to the previous ones .",
    "charge transport in heterostructures , at low temperatures , is dominated by the electron - ionized impurity scattering , while the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering has little consequences . in contrast , as we have shown , the spin transport is largely affected by the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering in high - quality samples . thus we expect that the spin transport properties in semiconductor devices should depend on spin - up and -down carrier distributions both in real and momentum space , in addition to the distributions of remote dopants .",
    "this fact should be taken into account in designing recently proposed spintronics devices .",
    "this work is supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan .",
    "the equations are shown in detail in our previous publication @xcite calculated in the hfa . in the present study , the mathematical expressions can be obtained by substituting the self - energy terms calculated in the rpa for those in the hfa .",
