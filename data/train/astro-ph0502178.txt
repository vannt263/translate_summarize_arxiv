    "the estimation of the baryon mass density of the universe essentially involves , for each class of objects having a visible baryon content , an integration over luminosity of the product of the luminosity function ( lf ) , @xmath3 , the luminosity , @xmath4 , and the mass - to - light ratio for the baryon component , @xmath5 , according to the expression @xmath6 where t represents e / s0 galaxies , spiral galaxies , clusters and superclusters , and @xmath7 and @xmath5 refer to the relevant class of objects . in the case of galaxies , equation ( 1 ) deserves some comments .",
    "first , let us note that the baryon mass - to - light ratio corresponds to the mass - to - light ratio of stars , and not to the dynamical one which usually includes dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "in fact , the presence of dm in the internal parts of spiral galaxies is very evident ( persic & salucci 1991 ) , so we can not ignore its contribution to the mass of a galaxy .",
    "in addition , the importance of dm is a function of luminosity : low - luminosity galaxies are affected more strongly than high luminosity ones ( persic & salucci 1988 , 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , it is essential that the mass - to - light ratio of the visible baryon content be the quantity that enters equation ( 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that different populations are present in galaxies of different hubble types .",
    "these have different lfs , different mean @xmath8 ratios , and different scaling properties of @xmath9 with luminosity .",
    "finally , note that , since @xmath10 scales as @xmath11 ( see equation 1 ) , when estimated by dynamical arguments the baryon density parameter @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the critical density is independent of @xmath14 .    in practice ,",
    "the detailed information required by equation ( 1 ) has not previously been available .",
    "standard estimates of @xmath10 have assumed a typical value for the visible mass - to - light ratio of galaxies , usually inferred from the observed dynamics and supposed to be representative for galaxies of all luminosities and hubble types .",
    "then equation ( 1 ) reduces to @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the galaxy luminosity density obtained by integrating the galaxy lf over luminosity and @xmath17 is an assumed mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in addition , the hot gas in clusters and groups of galaxies has often been neglected in the computation of @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 is the hubble constant . ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for purposes of illustration , in table l we summarize previous calculations of @xmath18 according to equation ( 2 ) .",
    "note that in most cases the _ dynamical _ rather than the _ stellar _ mass to - light ratio is used .",
    "the range in the adopted values found in the literature does not reflect observational uncertainties but , rather , real differences in stellar populations , in proportions of dm and in the reference radius where the dynamical mass - to - light ratio is considered .",
    "detailed information has recently been published on the properties of stellar mass - to - light versus luminosity relations for e / s0 and s galaxies ( van der marel 1991 ; persic & salucci 1991 ) , as well as on the relation between hot gas content and x - ray luminosity for clusters of galaxies ( edge & stewart 1991a , b ) .",
    "also , lfs have become available for e / s0 and s galaxies separately ( efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) as well as for clusters ( edge et al .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain dynamical measures of the visible mass associated with these structures .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use these advances in estimating the value of @xmath18 .",
    "the value we find , @xmath20 is lower than some previous estimates .",
    "compared to current standard nucleosynthesis predictions , our estimate aggravates the problem of the missing baryons.",
    "in all cases , the lf will have the usual schechter ( 1976 ) form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a normalization constant , @xmath23 is the slope of the lf at low luminosities , and @xmath24 is the luminosity corresponding to the knee of the lf ; and the baryon mass - to - light versus luminosity relation will be a power law : @xmath25 with @xmath26 the mass - to - light ratio at the characteristic luminosity @xmath27 . inserting equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) into equation ( 2 ) we get @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the observed minimum and maximum luminosities for a given class of objects .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath26 and @xmath33 are observationally known and will be chosen accordingly for each class of objects .",
    "we shall treat separately elliptical ( and s0 ) galaxies , spiral galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies .      from efstathiou",
    "et al.s ( 1988 ) field - galaxy lf we get @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; we take @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "there is strong evidence that ellipticals do not have dm inside their optical radii , so their dynamical masses at the optical radius and their stellar masses coincide ( see djorgovski & davis 1987 ) . from van der marel ( 1991 )",
    "we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( all values refer to the b band ) . inserting these values into equation ( 5 ) ,",
    "the integral takes a value of 0.97 , and we then get @xmath41 .",
    "thus the baryon contribution of elliptical galaxies to the mean density is    @xmath42      from efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) we get @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; we take @xmath46 and @xmath38 . dark and visible matter are already well mixed in the optical regions of spirals ( e.g. persic & salucci 1991 ) . from persic & salucci ( 1990 ) dynamical disk / halo mass decomposition of rotation curves ,",
    "we get @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( all values refer to the b band ) . inserting these values into equation ( 5 ) , the integral takes a value of 0.94 , so we get @xmath49 corresponding to    @xmath50      the hot , x - ray emitting , diffuse intracluster gas is a distinctive prominent baryon component of clusters ( e.g. sarazin 1986 ) . from edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) we get @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; we take @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; relative to the gas mass within @xmath56 mpc radius , from edge & stewart ( 1991a ) we take @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( ali the x - ray data are relative to the ( 2 - 10 ) kev band . ) inserting the above values into equation ( 5 ) , the integral takes a value of 7.6 , corresponding to ( a contribution to ) @xmath59 .",
    "this estimate refers to the gas mass contained within @xmath60 radius ( i.e. , within - 2 optical core radii , see bahcall 1977 ) . in ,",
    "at least some cases , however , there is evidence ( jones & forman 1984 ) for significant amounts of gas at larger distances , @xmath61 .",
    "this distance is a good measure of the typical virialization radius of rich clusters [ e.g. , from a recent study of a large rich - cluster sample we have @xmath62 ( biviano et al .",
    "1992 ) ] , and corresponds to the abell ( 1958 ) radius , ie .",
    "the radius roughly encompassing most of the cluster s member galaxies . the hot - gas surface - brightness profile can be described in terms of the so - called @xmath63-model , @xmath64^{-3\\beta+1/2}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 ( the core radius ) and @xmath63 as free parameters , which implies a de - projected spatial gas density distribution of the form @xmath66^{-3\\beta/2}\\ ] ] ( e.g. , henriksen & mushatzky 1985 ; david et al .",
    "fits to einstein ipc data far a survey of clusters give for @xmath63 an average value of @xmath67 ( see jones & forman 1984 ; david et al 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , on average , beyond a few core radii the hot- gas density falls off as @xmath68 , and the mass in gas rises linearly with radius .",
    "we therefore estimate that the hot - gas contribution of rich clusters from within the abell radius is    @xmath69 in addition to the diffuse gas , further baryons in clusters are contributed by the stellar component of the member galaxies .",
    "however , recent direct estimates ( see edge & stewart 1991b ) indicate that , in the cores of clusters , the stellar mass is up to a factor of 3 smaller than the gas mass .",
    "further out there are indications that the galaxy distribution drops more rapidly than the gas ( e.g. , eyles et al . 1991 ) , so that within a few core radii the stellar mass is significantly lower than the gas mass ( roughly 10 per cent for a stellar mass - to - light ratio of 4 ; see david et al .",
    "1990 ) , and at the abell radius the stellar component is negligible compared to the gas mass .",
    "a population of poor clusters and groups of galaxies must certainly contribute to the baryon content .",
    "the information on the lf and the gas content at these mass scales is quite scanty .",
    "we extrapolate the edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) c1uster x - ray lf through the range of luminosities typical far these structures , @xmath70 ( see kriss , cioffi & canizares 1983 ; bahcall , harris & rood 1984 ; see bahcall 1979 for a discussion of the continuity of cluster and group lfs ) .",
    "thus in equation ( 5 ) we take the parameters of the edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) cluster lf ( see above ) , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "relative to the hot - gas content within @xmath73 radius , the _ einstein _ data of kriss et al . ( 1983 ) imply @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( in the 0.5 - 4.5 kev band ) .",
    "the integral in equation ( 5 ) takes a value of 13 , so we derive @xmath76 corresponding to a contribution to @xmath77 allowing far any hot gas extending out to a typical group virialization radius ( @xmath78 , see pisani 1990 ) , by the same argument used for the rich clusters we get @xmath79",
    "from equations ( 6)-(9 ) , we conclude that the combined baryon contribution of galaxies and clusters to the mean density is : @xmath80    as @xmath81 with a currently favored value of = 1.5 ( e.g. , pierce & tully 1988 ) , the cluster / group density contribution(see equations 8 and 9 ) is probably @xmath82 .",
    "the estimated contribution of the stellar populations of galaxies ( see equations 6 and 7 ) is @xmath83 this value is in very good agreement with the cosmological mass density of the damped ly@xmath23 system , which are un likely to be proto - galactic discs and would give a present - day contribution of @xmath84(see wolfe 1988 ) .",
    "note that the explicit inclusion of the general trend of decreasing stellar mass - to - light ratio with decreasing luminosity and the accounting for different morphological classes have the effect of reducing the estimated baryon contribution of galaxies .",
    "in fact , the often - assumed values of @xmath85 for ellipticals and @xmath86 for spirals actually refer only to the brightest objects ( i.e. @xmath87 ) .",
    "assuming such values as typical would overestimate the baryon contribution from stars by a factor of - 2 .",
    "as an example ( of it ) , let us take our mass - to - light ratios at @xmath27 as the typical values ( i.e. 4 far ellipticals and 1.2 far spirals ) to be used in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "let us also use separate lfs to compute the luminosity densities due to ellipticals and spirals ( i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , from efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ) . then equation ( 2 ) would be written as @xmath90_{e / s0 } + [ { \\cal l } < ( m_b / l_b ) > ] _ s\\ ] ] @xmath91+[0.54 \\times   10 ^ 8    \\times 1.2 ] )   h_{50}^{-2 }    m_\\odot /mpc^{-3}\\ ] ] thus we would find ( from the above equation ) contributions to @xmath92 of @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the two classes separately .",
    "this example shows that the discrepancy between some previous estimates of @xmath95 ( claimed to agree with nucleosynthesis limits ) and our own estimate arises mainly because these calculations used _ dynamical _ and unrealistic mass - to - light ratios and , to a lesser extent , because they did not use separate lfs for different morphologies .",
    "further baryons , in the farm of hot ( @xmath96 ) diffuse gas , could be supplied by superclusters . however , the observational limit to any diffuse x - ray emission from candidate supercluster cores ( see persic et al .",
    "1990 ) , alongside the spatial frequency of superclusters ( ie . , @xmath97 ) , indicates a negligible contribution : @xmath98    another reservoir of baryons could be cold diffuse hi gas in the local intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "however , the absence of the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) trough on local scales places a severe upper bound to any such contribution : @xmath99 ( see davidsen et al 1977 )    we therefore expect that our derived value of @xmath18 in equation ( 10 ) gives a close representation of the actual visible baryon content of the local universe .",
    "[ fabian s ( 1991 ) recent estimate of the baryon density in the shapley supercluster , @xmath100 is not necessarily in contradiction with our estimate .",
    "in fact , fabian s high value relates to a most exceptional region of @xmath101 size and with @xmath102 , while our low value refers to the whole nearby universe out to a radius of @xmath103 and with @xmath104 our value , @xmath20 , is substantially lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis , @xmath105 with a probable value of @xmath106 ( e.g. , kolb & turner 1990 ; peebles et al . 1991 ) . comparing the observed and the predicted baryon abundances",
    ", we conclude that _ the stars and gas of galaxies and clusters / groups account for only @xmath107 per cent of the primordially synthesized baryons _ ( see also hogan 1990 ; kolb & turner 1990 ) . where are the 90 per cent of missing baryons ? we have only taken an inventory of the visible baryons associated with visible structures .",
    "additional baryons , unaccounted for by the present census , can either be clumped in some dark form , for instance forming dark haloes around galaxies , or be distributed in a diffuse ionized background .",
    "[ note that the diffuse dm associated with clusters , exceeding the gas mass by at most a factor of - 3 ( e.g. , eyles et al . 1991 ) , could not solve the discrepancy with standard nucleosynthesis even if it were completely baryonic .",
    "] let us consider each of the two possibilities in turn .    _",
    "( i ) baryons in haloes . _",
    "the dark haloes of spiral galaxies may well extend out to 10 - 20 times the size of the optical discs .",
    "thus it is not difficult to conceive that , by integrating the dynamical mass - to - light ratio of galaxies ( computed at such extended radii ) over the lp , the nucleosynthesis value of @xmath108 might be easily reached . an attractive way of hiding the missing baryons , therefore , is to assume that they constitute the dm in galaxy haloes .",
    "this possibility may find support from the evidence that cooling flows may be producing baryonic dm in the form of low - mass stars or brown dwarfs ( e.g. , fabian , nulsen & canizares 1984 ) . based on cooling flow analogies ,",
    "thomas & fabian ( 1990 ) have argued that baryonic dm only forms on fairly large mass - scales where gas cooling is quasi - static , while ashman ( 1990 ) has suggested that baryonic dm forms on galactic and subgalactic scales , following rapid gas cooling ( ashman & carr 1991 ) .    _",
    "( ii ) ionized igm_. the second possibility is to suppose that galaxy formation is extremely inefficient , so that only 10 per cent of gas in the universe is now in collapsed structures such as galaxies .",
    "this could arise if gas was never incorporated into galaxies , or if gas was expelled from protogalaxies by supernova explosions or galactic winds ( bookbinder et al .",
    "1980 ) . in this scenario",
    ", most baryons in the universe now constitute a smooth ionized igm , in agreement with the lack of any gunn - peterson trough in the spectra of quasars both at high redshifts ( see sargent & steidel 1990 ) and locally ( davidsen et al . 1977 ) .",
    "there is no shortage of proposed sources of ionization . among conventional ad hoc sources",
    "there are population iii stars ( carr 1990 ) , dwarf and starbursts galaxies ( silk , wyse & shields 1987 ; songaila , cowie & lilly 1990 ) and obscured quasars ( miralda - escude & ostriker 1990 ) . alternatively",
    ", a non - conventional self consistent explanation involves the radiative decay of cosmological dark matter particles ( rephaeli & szalay 1981 ; sciama 1982 ) .",
    "we conclude by stressing that the result presented in this paper , in connection with the dynamical estimates of the total mass density of the universe on scales @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( see davis et al . 1980 ; davis & peebles 1983 ) supports the conventional view on the need for non - baryonic extra dark matter .",
    "we thank dennis sciama for stimulating conversions that motivated us to undertake this calculation and for continuous encouragement .",
    "we also thank keith ashman for discussing with us the role of baryonic dark matter .",
    "finally , we acknowledge the referee s useful advice which has helped us to improve the presentation of this work .",
