    "the surprising existence of short period ( @xmath04 days ) jupiter mass extra - solar planets ( termed `` hot jupiters '' ) confirmed by radial velocity measurements in the last decade has shown us that planetary systems exist in patterns unlike that of our own solar system .",
    "the class of hot jupiter planets ( @xmath4 days and @xmath5 ) makes up @xmath019% ( 27 out of 140 as of 01/02/05 ) of the planets discovered to date @xcite and @xmath01% of nearby solar type stars host such a companion @xcite .",
    "recently we are starting to see the fruits of current transit surveys .",
    "ogle have produced over 100 transit candidates during two seasons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , by far the most prolific transit survey .",
    "explore / oc have produced a handful of transit candidates that are currently being followed up spectroscopically @xcite and a search of the macho photometry database has revealed nine transit candidates @xcite . to date",
    "there are seven confirmed transiting extra - solar planets , hd 209458b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) discovered first by the radial velocity method , and ogle - tr-56b @xcite , ogle - tr-113b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ogle - tr-132b @xcite , ogle - tr-111b @xcite , tres-1 @xcite and ogle - tr-10b @xcite discovered first by the transit method .",
    "the spectroscopic follow - up of the ogle transit candidates has revealed a new class of short period planets called the `` very hot jupiters '' .",
    "such planets have periods less than the 3 day cut - off identified in the sample of radial velocity planets .    in order to discover transiting hot jupiters through a photometric survey",
    ", one requires high cadence , high accuracy observations ( @xmath6% accuracy per data point with a duty cycle @xmath7 data points per hour ) of many stars ( @xmath8 ) simultaneously over long observing runs ( @xmath9 nights ) .",
    "any transit candidates ( stars that show at least one eclipse event ) may be subsequently followed up by radial velocity ( rv ) measurements in order to determine the companion mass , or at least an upper limit to the mass . however , due to the long integration times on large telescopes required for rv follow - up and the high frequency of planetary transit mimics , it is prudent to try and rule out the transiting planet model for as many transit candidates as possible via simple supplementary observations and/or further analysis of the lightcurve ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the study of open clusters for transiting planets has a number of advantages over fields in other parts of the sky or galactic plane .",
    "while providing a relatively large concentration of stars on the sky ( but not so large as to cause blending problems as in the case of globular clusters observed from the ground ) , they also provide a set of common stellar parameters for the cluster members .",
    "these are metallicity , age , stellar crowding and radiation density .",
    "also , the fainter cluster members are smaller stars and therefore they are likely to show deeper transit signatures , helping to offset sky noise contributions .",
    "the identification of the cluster main sequence in the colour magnitude diagram allows the assignment of a model - dependent mass and radius to each photometric cluster member , and assuming a law relating extinction to distance for the field allows the assignment of a model - dependent mass , radius and distance to all stars in the field under the assumption that they are main sequence stars .",
    "transit candidates with well defined phased lightcurves may therefore be analysed in detail as to whether they are consistent with a transiting planet model .",
    "an estimate of the fraction of stars hosting a hot jupiter ( referred to as the hot jupiter fraction ) may be obtained by comparing the number of hot jupiters that are actually detected to how many one would expect to detect using the knowledge of the star properties and the lightcurves themselves .",
    "the dependence of the hot jupiter fraction on the cluster parameters may then be investigated by extending the experiment to other open clusters .",
    "currently there are a number of groups searching for transiting planets in open clusters @xcite .",
    "these include ustaps ( @xcite ; this paper ; @xcite ) , explore / oc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , stepss @xcite and pisces ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a number of transit candidates have been put forward by these groups but none have been confirmed as transiting planets so far . in this survey , as with open cluster transit surveys in general , we are photometrically observing faint stars ( 16 to 21 mag ) .",
    "this makes follow - up observations difficult but not impossible .",
    "however , many of the stars observed are of later spectral types than those probed by the rv surveys since rv surveys are limited to bright solar neighbourhood fgk stars .",
    "in particular , our survey of ngc  7789 probes the spectral types f5 to m5 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) including a large proportion of k and m stars .",
    "furthermore , we are searching for planets out to distances well beyond the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the observations of open cluster ngc  7789 is the subject of this paper .",
    "the main parameters of the cluster are shown in table 1 .",
    "for a good review of previous relevant work on this cluster see @xcite . in section 2",
    "we report on the observations made , in section 3 we present in detail the data reduction / photometry , in section 4 we present the astrometry and colour data , in section 5 we describe the transit detection algorithm and in section 6 we present a detailed analysis of the transit candidates .",

    "this solution is reported in table 7 under model b , and the @xmath52 of the fit is 729.99",
    ".    however , there are two other models for tr-3 that should be considered to see if they produce a better @xmath52 value for the fit to the lightcurve data .",
    "it is possible that the companion is a smaller and less luminous star than the primary star that produces a secondary eclipse which is not visible in the lightcurve folded at the @xmath01.24 day period , and it is also possible that the companion is a star of similar size and luminosity to the primary star and that the system actually has an orbital period of @xmath02.48 days . in order to test these models for tr-3",
    "we have developed an eclipsing binary model based on the same assumptions as for the star and planet system presented in section 6.1 except that we assume that the companion is now luminous and massive , and that our theoretical main sequence relationships adopted in section 4.3 apply to the companion .",
    "the eclipsing binary model has five parameters to optimise : orbital period @xmath53 , time of mid - eclipse @xmath54 , orbital inclination @xmath55 , companion to primary star radius ratio @xmath20 and a constant magnitude @xmath56 .",
    "we fitted this model to the lightcurve of tr-3 by calculating the @xmath52 for a grid in @xmath55 and @xmath20 .",
    "for each value of @xmath20 , we had to recalculate the distance @xmath57 to the system , the values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the primary star , and the mass of the companion @xmath60 .",
    "this was done by constructing a theoretical binary main sequence for the current value of @xmath20 and then finding the distance @xmath57 such that this model passes through the position of tr-3 in the colour - magnitude domain .",
    "the initial value of @xmath53 was either 1.24  d or 2.48  d corresponding to the smaller or similar size stellar companion models respectively .",
    "table 7 reports the results of these fits .",
    "13 shows a chi squared contour map , a folded and binned lightcurve with the best fit eclipsing binary model , an unbinned close - up of the folded lightcurve around the primary eclipse along with the best fit model and another unbinned close - up around the secondary eclipse along with the best fit model .",
    "the left hand column of diagrams in fig .",
    "13 applies to the case of the smaller stellar companion and the right hand column of diagrams in fig .",
    "13 applies to the case of the similar size stellar companion .",
    "table  7 shows that the best model for tr-3 is the eclipsing binary model with a similar size stellar companion since this model attains the smallest @xmath52 of 725.88 .",
    "all three models require exactly 5 parameters to be optimised and hence we calculate a likelihood ratio of @xmath07.8 for the eclipsing binary model with a similar size stellar companion compared to the transiting planet model , and we calculate a likelihood ratio of @xmath018.6 for the eclipsing binary model with a similar size stellar companion compared to the eclipsing binary model with a smaller stellar companion .",
    "finally , we calculate a likelihood ratio of @xmath02.4 for the transiting planet model compared to the eclipsing binary model with a smaller stellar companion .",
    "hence our conclusion is that this system is most likely to be a grazing eclipsing binary with period 2.49  d consisting of a k4v star primary and a k5v star secondary that lies at @xmath61kpc , slightly behind the cluster .",
    "however , further observations will be required confirm this conclusion and categorically rule out the transiting planet model .",
    "in the search for our transit candidates we have developed an accurate , efficient and fast photometry pipeline employing the technique of difference image analysis .",
    "raw data from the telescope are processed by the pipeline with minimal user input in order to directly produce lightcurves and colour magnitude diagrams .",
    "this is especially important considering the high quantity of data that may arise from a transit survey .",
    "our analysis of the colour magnitude diagrams by including the treatment of extinction for the open cluster ngc  7789 has allowed us to assign a model - dependent mass , radius and distance to each star .",
    "such information is vital in the subsequent analysis of the transit candidates since it allows a direct estimate of the companion radius .",
    "we detected 24 transit candidates which warranted a detailed analysis of their lightcurves and we were able to determine periods for 14 of these candidates . of the 10 candidates without periods , we could rule out the transiting planet model for 7 of them by determining the minimum companion radius and for another one by predicting the orbital period . for int-7789-tr-1 , it was only at the 1@xmath27 level that we could rule out the transiting planet model based on the shape of the best eclipse .",
    "for int-7789-tr-2 we found a companion radius of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) based on the analysis of the best eclipse .",
    "follow - up observations ( see below ) will be required for both of these candidates in order confirm that int-7789-tr-1 is an eclipsing binary and in order to determine the nature of int-7789-tr-2 .",
    "for the 14 transit candidates with well determined periods , we could rule out the transiting planet model for 4 of them from the detection of previously disguised secondary eclipses , and for 3 of them from the observation that the out - of - eclipse lightcurve data exhibit ellipsoidal variations and heating effects .",
    "one of the candidates is possibly a new cataclysmic variable with a long period ( 10.8 h ) which could be a cluster member , worthy of follow up observations in its own right .",
    "all of the 8 above mentioned candidates plus another 5 may be ruled out as having planetary companions by considering that the companion radius obtained from the full transit fit is greater than 0.2@xmath14 . for int-7789-tr-3",
    ", none of the above arguments may be used to rule out the transiting planet model . however , on application of an eclipsing binary model to the lightcurve we find that the model consisting a pair of grazing k dwarf stars is @xmath07.8 times more likely than the transiting planet model .",
    "this is by no means a definitive conclusion that int-7789-tr-3 is an eclipsing binary since there is a non - negligible probability that the transiting planet model is still valid .",
    "follow - up observations will be required to confirm that int-7789-tr-3 is the type of eclipsing binary that we predict in this paper .",
    "future photometric observations of the three transit candidates for which we could not rule out the transiting planet model with confidence should consist of time series observations in two different filters .",
    "eclipsing binary status may be confirmed by the observation of different eclipse depths in different filters since a planetary transit is an achromatic event . int-7789-tr-1 and",
    "int-7789-tr-2 also require the observations of multiple eclipses in order to determine their period and whether they exhibit secondary eclipses or not .",
    "if these follow up photometric observations still allow the possibility that the transiting planet model is valid , then radial velocity observations may be used to place an upper limit on the mass of the orbiting companion , hopefully low enough to rule out a stellar or brown dwarf companion .",
    "the fact that these candidates are so faint ( @xmath64  mag for int-7789-tr-1 , @xmath65  mag for int-7789-tr-2 and @xmath66  mag for int-7789-tr-3 ) makes it very unlikely that radial velocity observations with 10-m class telescopes will achieve the accuracy required to determine the actual mass of the companion @xcite .    from a simple signal - to - noise argument presented in section 4.5",
    ", we expected to detect @xmath02 transiting hot jupiters . at most",
    "we have detected 3 transiting hot jupiters , but our analysis of these candidates shows that this is very unlikely .",
    "follow up observations will most likely show that our candidates are eclipsing binaries , which means that our transit survey will have produced a null result .",
    "we are currently modelling in more detail the number of hot jupiters that we expected to detect as a function of planetary radius , orbital period , star mass and detection threshold via monte carlo simulations .",
    "the results of these simulations are consistent with our simple estimate of the expected number of detections , and by combining this information with the results of further observations on the three remaining transit candidates , we will be able to estimate the hot jupiter fraction of the cluster field , a very important result for the testing of star and planetary formation theories .",
    "this research made use of the simbad data base operated at cds , strasbourg , france and the webda data base operated at the university of lausanne , switzerland .",
