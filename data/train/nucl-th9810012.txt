    "ultraviolet divergences appear in exact as well as perturbative treatments of the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical two - body problem in momentum space interacting via two - body potentials with certain singular behavior at short distances @xcite in two and three space dimensions .",
    "similar divergences appear in perturbative quantum field theory and are usually treated by renormalization techniques @xcite .",
    "there are several variants of renormalization which employ different types of regularizations , such as , the cut - off , and dimensional regularizations .",
    "unless there is some symmetry violation in performing regularization , in perturbative field theory , both regularization schemes are expected to lead to the same renormalized result at low energies .",
    "the closely related technique of discretization on the lattice in such field theoretic problems also should lead to equivalent results .",
    "exactly as in quantum field theory , the ultraviolet divergences in quantum mechanics can be treated by renormalization .",
    "three schemes have been used for the purpose : cut - off regularization @xcite , dimensional regularization @xcite , and discretization on the lattice @xcite . for the simplest @xmath0-function potential",
    "all three approaches lead to identical result .",
    "recently , cut - off @xcite and dimensional @xcite regularizations have been successfully used by several workers in quantum mechanical problems in @xmath1 and higher partial waves in the context of nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "although , both regularization schemes have been successfully used for the purpose of renormalization in quantum mechanical problems with ultraviolet divergence , their equivalence can not be demonstrated except in the simplest problems . in this work",
    "we consider several problems with ultraviolet divergence , allow energy - dependent bare couplings , and find the forms that these couplings must take in order to obtain equivalence between the two regularization schemes .",
    "we consider four potentials for illustration .",
    "the simplest is the minimal potential in a general partial wave considered recently @xcite . in momentum space",
    "this potential possesses only the threshold behavior and is given by the following one - term separable form @xmath2 with @xmath3 the angular momentum . for @xmath4 , this potential is the usual @xmath0-function potential . as the lippmann - schwinger equation has the same generic form in all partial waves , the ultraviolet divergence of this potential becomes stronger and stronger as @xmath3 increases .",
    "next we consider a two - term separable potential of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are each divergent form factors of the type @xmath8 , considered in the first potential .",
    "we also consider the potential @xcite @xmath9 potential ( [ 3 ] ) is the sum of a @xmath0 function and its second derivatives .",
    "this potential is interesting as it appears as a piece in the low - energy nucleon - nucleon potential derived from effective field theory and has received attention recently @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the following minimal tensor nucleon - nucleon potential possessing ultraviolet divergence @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are divergent @xmath1 and @xmath13 wave parts of the nucleon - nucleon potential ( [ 1 ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ 40 ] ) the angular momentum labels @xmath3 and @xmath14 are explicitly shown .",
    "the term involving @xmath15 provides the @xmath16 coupling . when @xmath17 , the @xmath1 and @xmath13 waves decouple and we essentially have potential ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the threshold factors for @xmath20 .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon potential derived from a chiral lagrangian formulation of effective field theory contains usual finite - range potentials superposed on divergent potentials containing delta - function and derivatives ( gradients ) and can be written as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents usual finite - range parts of the potential .",

    "though one can renormalize the divergent parts separately , it is not clear that a potential , such as ( [ div ] ) , containing a divergent and a finite - range part can be successfully renormalized .",
    "though a general answer to this question involving local finite - range potentials may involve a complicated numerical calculational scheme , we would like to address this point in a much simpler context , where we take the finite - range part to be an attractive separable potential frequently used to simulate the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we perform an analysis to show that when a divergent potential of the form @xmath23 or @xmath24 is summed to an attractive separable potential , the renormalized scattering @xmath25 or @xmath26 matrix leads to physically plausible results for the nucleon - nucleon system at low energies .",

    "we introduce a bare coupling in ( [ 107x ] ) in place of @xmath115 such that @xmath170 is a finite quantity , where @xmath171 is the renormalized coupling which is taken to be energy independent .",
    "then one obtains the following regularized @xmath25 matrix @xmath172 which is appropriate for both cut - off and dimensional regularizations .",
    "of course , in dimensional regularization , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , if energy - independent bare coupling is used .",
    "if we demand that regularized @xmath25 matrix ( [ 70 ] ) should yield identical phase - shift or scattering length as that produced by potential @xmath175 we find that @xmath176 , which sets the divergent potential equal to zero . in order that ( [ 70 ] ) still models the @xmath1-wave nucleon - nucleon triplet @xmath25 matrix in the presence of a non - zero divergent potential , either the strength @xmath15 or the parameter @xmath177 of the separable potential should be changed once the divergent potential is included .",
    "we keep the parameter @xmath178 @xmath165 unchanged and consider two possibilities for the coupling @xmath15 of @xmath22 in the presence of the divergent potentials : @xmath179 fm and @xmath180 fm . in order that renormalized @xmath25 matrix ( [ 70 ] )",
    "leads to the scattering length 5.42 fm , one should have @xmath181 fm ( 0.0296 fm ) for @xmath182 , and @xmath183 fm ( @xmath1030.0362 fm ) for @xmath184 with the form - factor of divergent potential @xmath185 ( @xmath18 ) . in the case , where the strength of the attractive separable interaction @xmath22 is increased ( decreased ) , the renormalized strength of the divergent potential should be repulsive ( attractive ) in order to reproduce the experimental scattering length 5.42 fm .",
    "this is reflected by the sign of the renormalized strength @xmath171 of the divergent potential in both cases .",
    "the phase shifts of different schemes are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where we plot phase shifts for potential @xmath22 ( solid line ) and the two sets of renormalized phase shifts in the presence of the divergent potentials @xmath115 ( dashed - dotted line ) and @xmath12 ( dashed line ) for @xmath182 and @xmath186 .",
    "the two lines below ( above ) the solid line correspond to @xmath182 ( @xmath187 ) .    in the presence of ultraviolet divergences ,",
    "any renormalization scheme should lead to physically plausible result at low energies , with energies much lower than the cut - off .",
    "hence the two versions of renormalized @xmath25 matrices ( [ 70 ] ) should be similar to @xmath25 matrix ( [ 69 ] ) at low energies . from figure 1",
    "we find that this is indeed the case .",
    "an examination of @xmath25 matrix ( [ 69 ] ) reveals that it tends to zero as @xmath188 , which is physically expected from scattering equation ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath25 matrix ( [ 70 ] ) tends to @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) as @xmath191 for @xmath185 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "hence at high energies the renormalized @xmath25 matrix has physically unacceptable behavior .",
    "however , ( [ 70 ] ) yields very reasonable result at low energies , which define the domain of validity of renormalization . in the presence of the divergent potential a new parametrization of the interaction is needed to fit the experimental observables . in order to fit the phase shifts to higher energies , specially in the presence of stronger ultraviolet divergence",
    ", the quantity @xmath192 has to be taken to be @xmath28 dependent with several parameters .",
    "we have renormalized the @xmath25 matrices obtained with potentials ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2a ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) by cut - off and dimensional regularizations .",
    "the solution of the dynamical problem in these cases involves ultraviolet divergences . for these potentials in three dimensions ,",
    "all dimensionally regularized divergent integrals over green functions are identically zero .",
    "both cut - off and dimensional regularization schemes lead to equivalent renormalized results for potentials ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2a ] ) , and ( [ 3 ] ) , only if general energy - dependent bare couplings are employed . for tensor potential ( [ 40 ] ) , both regularizations in three dimensions also lead to equivalent @xmath25 matrices .",
    "we also performed renormalization when the potential is the sum of a separable and an analytic divergent potential .",
    "for the divergent parts we took one of the following two potentials : @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the renormalized result is taken to simulate the @xmath1-wave spin - triplet nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "we find that in both cases the low - energy renormalized phase shifts are physically plausible .",
    "the present analytical and numerical studies demonstrate that regularization and renormalization are efficient tools for treating divergent potentials in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
