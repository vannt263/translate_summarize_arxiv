    "high redshift powerful radio galaxies ( hzrg , @xmath32 ) are characterized by an emission line spectrum which is rich in emission lines of different ionization species . in the optical ( uv rest frame ) , ly@xmath2 is usually the strongest emission line , followed by civ@xmath81550 , heii@xmath81640 , ciii]@xmath81909 and , less frequently , nv@xmath81240 ( civ , heii , ciii ] and nv hereafter ) .",
    "de breuck et al . ( 2000a , db00a hereafter ) observed that ly@xmath2 is unusually strong in some hzrg , most of which are at @xmath33 .",
    "they also found that the ly@xmath2 equivalent width increases at @xmath9 and the ratios of ly@xmath2 to civ , ciii ] and heii are roughly twice the value found for lower redshift objects ( 2@xmath10 ) .",
    "the authors interpret these results as spectroscopic evidence for the youth of radio galaxies at @xmath33 , which are still surrounded by large halos of primordial hydrogen from which the galaxy is formed .",
    "in this paper we present a more thorough study of @xcite results .",
    "we start by quantifying (  3 ) the variation of the ly@xmath2/heii and ly@xmath2/civ ratios and ly@xmath2 luminosity with redshift for radio galaxies at 1.8@xmath114.4 and interpret the results in the light of appropriate photoionization models ( described in  3 ) and/or scenarios (  5 ) .",
    "the results and the cosmological consequences will be discussed in  6 .",
    "summary and conclusions will be presented in  7 .",

    "we will not consider lower @xmath16 objects , for which ly@xmath2 is not observable .",
    "our final sample consists of 13 radio galaxies at @xmath03 and 48 radio galaxies at 1.8@xmath173 .",
    "table 1 shows the sample with some relevant information .",
    "the original data set of de breuck et al . includes radio galaxies from nine samples designed to find hzrg .",
    "as the authors explain , the surveys can be divided into two types ( see db00a for all appropriate references of each survey ) : ( i ) several large flux density - limited surveys such as the 3cr , mrc , brl sample , and 6c , 7c and 8c surveys ; ( ii ) several  filtered \" surveys , which were designed to find the highest redshift objects . in the latter case ,",
    "the radio spectral index flux is most often used ( ultra steep spectrum sources ) , sometimes in combination with an angular size upper limit . alternatively , the filter consists of a flux density interval centered around the peak in the source counts around 1 jy .",
    "the total sample contains 176 radio galaxies with @xmath16 in the range 0.05 to 5.2 .",
    "it contains a similar number of sources at @xmath18 and at @xmath42 . for the present study",

    "the behaviour of the ly@xmath2/heii , ly@xmath2/civ ratios and the ly@xmath2 line luminosity has been investigated in a sample of 48 radio galaxies at 2@xmath243 and 13 radio galaxies at @xmath03 for which ly@xmath2/heii and/or ly@xmath2/civ measurements are available .    as found by @xcite , @xmath03 radio galaxies tend to show larger ly@xmath2 ratios ( 2.2 and 1.5 times higher for ly@xmath2/heii and ly@xmath2/civ respectively ) and higher ( 3 times ) ly@xmath2 luminosities than the low @xmath16 sample .",

    "this is the case for only 8% ( 4 out 48 ) of radio galaxies at 2@xmath253 .",
    "we refer to all these objects with unusually enhanced ly@xmath2 emission as ly@xmath2 excess objects or laes .",

    "36% of laes show ly@xmath2/heii above the standard model predictions . since in general",
    "no absorption has been taken into account , this fraction could be larger .",
    "several possibilities have been investigated to explain the ly@xmath2 excess in laes : stellar photoionization , shocks , low metallicities , high densities and absorption / resonant scattering effects .",
    "all scenarios but the first can be rejected with confidence : we propose that a population of young stars generate the extra supply of soft ionizing photons necessary to produce the observed ly@xmath2 excess in laes . star forming rates @xmath19200 m@xmath26 yr@xmath15 are required .",
    "the enhanced and intense star formation activity in laes could be a consequence of a recent merger event which has triggered both the star formation and the radio / agn activities .",
    "this interpretation is strongly supported by the clear trend for objects with lower optical continuum polarization level to show larger ly@xmath2/heii ratios .",
    "it is further supported by the tentative trend found by other authors for @xmath03 radio galaxies to show lower uv - rest frame polarization levels , or the dramatic increase on the detection rate at submm wavelengths of @xmath42.5 radio galaxies .",
    "the models imply that star formation is occuring in 45% ( 5 out of 11 ) of laes .",
    "since absorption has not been taken into account , this is a lower limit .",
    "the finding of enhanced ly@xmath2 emission at tens of kpc from the nuclear region in some objects suggests that star formation can be extended over spatial scales of tens of kpc .",
    "we argue that , although the fraction of laes may be incompletely determined , both at 2@xmath5 and at @xmath6 , the much larger fraction of laes found at @xmath03 is a genuine redshift evolution and not due to selection effects .",
    "therefore , our study suggests that the radio galaxy phenomenon was more often associated with a massive starburst at @xmath43 than at @xmath73 . in other words , powerful radio galaxies ( and , according to the unification model , powerful radio quasars ) , appear in more actively star forming galaxies at @xmath43 than at @xmath73 .    enhanced ly@xmath2 ratios in the extended gas of some @xmath73 radio galaxies suggest that star formation is also present in these objects , although at lower levels .",
    "star formation could also be responsible for the ly@xmath2 emission from regions out of the reach of the quasar continuum and the radio structures detected in some high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "we propose to use the ly@xmath2 ratios ( specially ly@xmath2/heii ) of high redshift ( @xmath32 ) radio galaxies and the extended gas in radio loud and radio quiet quasars to investigate the possible signature of star formation .",
