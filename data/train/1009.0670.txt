    "the study of networks ( i.e. graph theory ) is the study of the relationship between vertices ( i.e.  nodes ) as defined by the edges ( i.e.  arcs ) connecting them . in path analysis ,",
    "a path metric function maps an ordered vertex pair into a real number , where that real number is the length of the path connecting to the two vertices .",
    "metrics that utilize the shortest path between two vertices in their calculation are called geodesic metrics .",
    "the geodesic metrics that will be reviewed in this article are shortest path , eccentricity @xcite , radius , diameter , betweenness centrality @xcite , and closeness centrality @xcite .    if @xmath0 is a single - relational network , then @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the set of vertices and @xmath3 is a subset of the product of @xmath4 . in a single - relational network",
    "all the edges have a single , homogenous meaning .",
    "because an edge in a single - relational network is an element of the product of @xmath4 , it does not have the ability to represent the type of relationships that exist between the two vertices it connects .",
    "an edge can only denote that there is a relationship . without a distinguishing label ,",
    "all edges in such networks have a single meaning .",
    "thus , they are called single - relational networks .",
    "is the union of two disjoint vertex sets .",
    "thus , edges from set @xmath5 to set @xmath6 ( such that @xmath7 ) can have a different meaning than the edges from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "also , theoretically , it is possible to represent edge labels as a topological feature of the graph structure @xcite . in other words",
    ", there exists an injective function ( though not surjective ) from the set of semantic networks to the set of single - relational networks that preserves the meaning of the edge labels . ]",
    "while a single - relational network supports the representation of a homogeneous set of relationships , a semantic network supports the representation of a heterogeneous set of relationships .",
    "for instance , in a single - relational network it is possible to represent humans connected to one another by friendship edges ; in a semantic network , it is possible to represent humans connected to one another by friendship , kinship , collaboration , communication , etc . relationships .    a semantic network denoted @xmath10 can be defined as a set of single - relational networks such that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and for any @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the meaning of a relationship in @xmath10 is determined by its set @xmath13 . perhaps a more convenient semantic network representation and",
    "the one to be used throughout the remainder of this article is that of the triple list where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a set of edge labels . a single edge in this representation",
    "is denoted by a triple @xmath17 , where vertex @xmath18 is connected to vertex @xmath19 by the edge label @xmath20 .    in some cases , it is possible to isolate sub - networks of a semantic network and represent the isolated network in an unlabeled form .",
    "unlabeled geodesic metrics can be used to compute on the isolated component . however , in many cases , the complexity of the path description does not support an unlabeled representation .",
    "these scenarios require  semantically aware \" geodesic metrics that respect a semantic network s ontology ( i.e.  the vertex classes and edge types ) @xcite .",
    "a semantic network is not simply a directed labeled network .",
    "it is a high - level representation of complex objects and their relationship to one another according to ontological constraints .",
    "there exist various algorithms to study semantically typed paths in a network @xcite . such algorithms assume only a path between two vertices and do not investigate other features of the intervening vertices .",
    "the benefit of the grammar - based geodesic model presented in this article is that complex paths can be represented to make use of path  bookkeeping . \"",
    "such bookkeeping investigates intervening vertices even though they may not be included in the final path solution .",
    "for example , it may be important to determine a set of  friendship \" paths between two human vertices , where every intervening human works for a particular organization and has a particular position in that organization .",
    "while a set of friendship paths is the result of the function , the path detours to determine employer and position are not . the technique for doing",
    "this is the primary contribution of this article .",
    "a secondary contribution is the unification of the grammar - based model proposed here with the grammar - based model proposed in @xcite for calculating stationary probability distributions in a subset of the full semantic network ( e.g.  eigenvector centrality @xcite and pagerank @xcite ) . with the grammar - based model ,",
    "a single framework exists that ports many of the popular single - relational network analysis algorithms to the semantic network domain .",
    "moreover , an algebra for mapping semantic networks to single - relational networks has been presented in @xcite and can be used to meaningfully execute standard single - relational network analysis algorithms on distortions of the original semantic network .",
    "the semantic web community does not often employee the standard suite of network analysis algorithms .",
    "this is perhaps due to the fact that the semantic web is generally seen as a knowledge - base grounded in description logics rather than graph- or network - theory .",
    "when the semantic web community adopts a network interpretation , it can benefit from the extensive body of work found in the network analysis literature .",
    "for example , recommendation @xcite , ranking @xcite , and decision making @xcite are a few of the types of semantic web applications that can benefit from a network perspective . in other words",
    ", graph / network theoretic techniques can be used to yield innovative solutions on the semantic web .",
    "the first half of this article will define a popular set of geodesic metrics for single - relational networks .",
    "it will become apparent from these definitions , that the more advanced geodesics rely on the shortest path metric .",
    "the second half of the article will present the grammar - based model for calculating a meaningful shortest path in a semantic network .",
    "the other geodesics follow from this definition .",
    "this section will review a collection of popular geodesic metrics used to characterize a path , a vertex , and a network .",
    "the following list enumerates these metrics and identifies whether they are path , vertex , or network metrics :    * in- and out - degree : vertex metric * shortest path : path metric * eccentricity : vertex metric * radius : network metric * diameter : network metric * closeness : vertex metric * betweenness : vertex metric .",
    "it is worth noting that besides in- and out - degree , all the metrics mentioned utilize a path function @xmath21 to determine the set of paths between any two vertices in @xmath4 , where @xmath22 is a set of paths .",
    "the premise of this article is that once a path function is defined for a semantic network , then all of the other metrics are directly derived from it . in the semantic network path function , @xmath23 returns the number of paths between two vertices according to a user - defined grammar @xmath24 .    before discussing the grammar - based geodesic model for semantic networks , this section will review the geodesic metrics in the domain of single - relational networks .",
    "the simplest structural metric for a vertex is the vertex s degree .",
    "while this is not a geodesic metric , it is presented as the concept will become necessary in the later section regarding semantic networks .    for directed networks , any vertex @xmath25 has both an in - degree and an out - degree .",
    "the set of edges in @xmath26 that have @xmath18 as either its in- or out - edge is denoted @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . if @xmath29 and @xmath30 then , @xmath31 is the subset of edges in @xmath26 incoming to @xmath18 and @xmath32 is the subset of edges outgoing from @xmath18 .",
    "the cardinality of the sets is the in- and out - degree of the vertex , denoted @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .      the shortest path metric is the foundation for all other geodesic metrics .",
    "this metric is defined for any two vertices @xmath35 such that the sink vertex @xmath19 is reachable from the source vertex @xmath18 in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath19 is unreachable from @xmath18 , the shortest path between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is undefined .",
    "the shortest path between any two vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 in an unweighted network is the smallest of the set of all paths between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . if @xmath36 is a function that takes two vertices and returns a set of paths @xmath22 where for any @xmath37 , @xmath38 , then the shortest path between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the @xmath39 , where @xmath40 returns the smallest value of its domain .",
    "the shortest path function is denoted @xmath41 with the function rule @xmath42 it is important to subtract @xmath43 from the path length since a path is defined as the set of edges traversed , not the set of vertices traversed .",
    "thus , for the path @xmath44 , the @xmath45 is @xmath46 , but the path length is @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath48 returns the set of all paths between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "of course , with the potential for loops , this function could return a @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in many cases , it is important to not consider all paths , but just those paths that have the same cardinality as the shortest path currently found and thus are shortest paths themselves .",
    "it is noted that all the remaining geodesic metrics require only the shortest path between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the radius and diameter of a network require the determination of the eccentricity of every vertex in @xmath4 .",
    "the eccentricity metric requires the calculation of @xmath50 shortest path calculations of a particular vertex @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity of a vertex @xmath18 is the largest shortest path between @xmath18 and all other vertices in @xmath4 such that the eccentricity function @xmath51 has the rule @xmath52 where @xmath53 returns the largest value of its domain .",
    "the radius of the network is the minimum eccentricity of all vertices in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath54 has the rule @xmath55    finally , the diameter of a network is the maximum eccentricity of the vertices in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath56 has the rule @xmath57      closeness and betweenness centrality are popular network metrics for determining the  centralness \" of a vertex .",
    "closeness centrality is defined as the mean shortest path between some vertex @xmath18 and all the other vertices in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath58 denotes the closeness function and has the rule @xmath59    betweenness centrality is defined for a vertex in @xmath4 .",
    "the betweenness of @xmath25 is the number of shortest paths that exist between all vertices @xmath60 and @xmath61 that have @xmath18 in their path divided by the total number of shortest paths between @xmath19 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 @xcite . if @xmath64 is a function that returns the set of shortest paths between any two vertices @xmath19 and @xmath62 such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the set of shortest paths between two vertices @xmath19 and @xmath62 that have @xmath18 in the path , where @xmath67 then the betweenness function @xmath68 has the rule @xmath69    it is worth noting that in @xcite , the author articulates the point that the shortest paths between two vertices is not necessarily the only mechanism of interaction between two vertices .",
    "thus , the author develops a variation of the betweenness metric that favors shortest paths , but does not utilize only shortest paths in its betweenness calculation .",
    "a semantic network is a directed labeled graph . however , a semantic network is perhaps best interpreted in an object - oriented fashion where complex objects ( i.e.  multi - vertex elements ) are connected to one another according to various relationship types . while a particular human is represented by a vertex , metadata associated with that individual",
    "is represented in the vertices adjacent to the human vertex ( e.g.  the human s name , address , age , etc . ) . in many instances , particular metadata vertices are sinks ( i.e.  no outgoing edges ) . in other cases ,",
    "the metadata of an individual is another complex object such as the friend of that human or the human s employer .",
    "the topological features of a semantic network are represented by a data type abstraction called an ontology ( i.e.  a semantic network schema ) .",
    "a popular semantic network representation is the resource description framework ( rdf ) @xcite .",
    "rdf schema ( rdfs ) is a schema language for developing rdf ontologies in rdf @xcite .",
    "this article will present all of its concepts from the perspective of rdf and rdfs primarily due to the fact that these are standard data models with a large application - base .",
    "however , these ideas can be generalized to any semantic network representation .",
    "this is due to the fact that one can remove the constraint of using uris , literals , and blank nodes when labeling vertices and edges .",
    "when such a constraint is lifted , then a directed , vertex / edge - labeled , multi - graph results . in the semantic network literature ,",
    "such an abstract graph type is named a semantic network @xcite .",
    "the first subsection will briefly introduce the concept of rdf and rdfs before describing an ontology for designing geodesic grammars .",
    "the rdf data model represents a semantic network as a triple list where the vertices and edges ( both called resources ) are uniform resource identifiers ( uri ) @xcite , blank nodes , or literals .",
    "if the set of all uris is denoted @xmath70 , the set of all blank nodes is denoted @xmath8 , and the set of all literals is denoted @xmath71 , then an rdf network is the triple list @xmath10 such that @xmath72 the first resource of a triple is called the subject , the second is called the predicate , and the third is called the object .",
    "a single triple @xmath73 is denoted as @xmath74 .",
    "all uris are namespaced such that the uri http://www.lanl.gov#marko has a namespace of http://www.lanl.gov # and a fragment of marko . in many cases , for document and diagram clarity",
    ", a namespace is prefixed in such a way that the previous uri is represented as lanl : marko . in this article , the namespaces for rdf and rdfs",
    "will be prefixed as rdf and rdfs , respectively .",
    "blank nodes are  anonymous \" vertices and are not discussed in this article as they will not directly pertain to any of the concepts presented .",
    "literals are any resource that denotes a string , integer , floating point , date , etc . the full taxonomy of literal types is presented in @xcite .    in rdfs",
    ", every vertex is tied to some platonic category representing its rdfs : class using the rdf : type property .",
    "moreover , every edge label has domain / range restrictions that determine the vertex types that the edge labels can be used in conjunction with .",
    "because the instance of an ontology obeys the defined constraints of the ontology , the modeler has an abstract representation of the topological features of the semantic network instance in terms of classes ( vertices ) and properties ( edge labels ) .",
    "for example , @xmath75 states that any resource of type lanl : human can have a friend that is only of type lanl : human .",
    "therefore , the following three triples are legal according to the simple ontology above : @xmath76 however , the three statements @xmath77 are not legal according to the ontology because lanl : fluffy is a lanl : dog and a lanl : human can not befriend anything that is not a lanl : human .",
    "the ontology and legal instance of the previous example are diagrammed in figure [ fig : friend - full ] .",
    "however , for the sake of brevity and clarity of the diagram , the domain and range properties of a class can be abbreviated as in figure [ fig : friend - abbrev ] .",
    "the abbreviated ontological diagram will be used throughout the remainder of this article .",
    "it is important to note that both the rdfs ontology and rdf instance network are represented in rdf and thus , both instances and ontology are contained within a single semantic network .",

    "transitivity exists for the rdfs : subpropertyof predicate as well",
    ".      this subsection will define the rdfs ontology for creating a grammar .",
    "any user - defined grammar must obey this ontology .",
    "the grammar constructed from this ontology determines the meaning of the value returned by a ",

    "any grammar instance is denoted @xmath79 .",
    "the instance of a grammar is represented in rdf and the ontology of the grammar is represented in rdfs .",

    "grammar - based geodesics rely on a discrete walker .",
    "the walker utilizes a @xmath24 grammar to constrain its path through @xmath10 .",
    "the combination of a walker and a @xmath24 is a breadth - first search through a particular sub - network of @xmath10 . that sub - network is abstractly represented by @xmath24 , but not fully realized until after the execution of @xmath24 on @xmath10 .",
    "any @xmath24 is a collection of rwr : context resources connected to one another by rwr : traverse resources .",
    "each rwr : context is an abstract representation of a legal step along a path that a walker can traverse on its way from source vertex @xmath18 to sink vertex @xmath19 .",
    "an rwr : context has an associated rwr : forresource property .",
    "the object of that property determines the set of legal vertices that that the rwr : context can resolve to .",
    "only when a walker utilizes a grammar do the rwr : contexts have a resolution to a particular vertex in @xmath10 .",
    "rwr : context resolution is further constrained by the rwr : rules and rwr : attributes of the rwr : context in @xmath24 .",
    "two important data structures that are used in a grammar are the rdf : bag and rdf : seq .",
    "an rdf : bag is an unordered set of elements where each element of the rdf : bag is the object of a triple with predicate rdf : li .",
    "an rdf : seq is an ordered set of elements where each element of the rdf : seq is the object of a triple with a predicate that is an rdfs : subpropertyof rdfs : containermembershipproperty ( i.e.  rdf:_1 , rdf:_2 , rdf:_3 , etc . ) .    there exist two rwr : rules ( an rdfs : subclassof rdf : seq ) : rwr : pathcount and rwr : traverse .",
    "the rwr : pathcount rule instructs the walker to record the vertex , edge , and directionality in the ordered path set that is ultimately returned by the grammar - based geodesic algorithm .",
    "the rwr : traverse rule instructs the walker to select some outgoing or incoming edge of its current vertex as defined by the set of rwr : edges associated with the rwr : traverse rule . if more than one choice should exist for the walker , the walker chooses both by cloning itself and having each clone take a unique branch of the path .",
    "there exist three rwr : attributes ( an rdfs : subclassof rdf : bag ) : rwr : notever , rwr : is , and rwr : not . in some instances , when traversing to a new vertex , the walker must respect the fact that it has already seen a particular vertex .",
    "the rwr : notever attribute ensures that the resolution of the rwr : context is not a previously seen vertex , thus preventing infinite loops .",
    "the rwr : is attribute allows the walker to explore an area around a particular vertex ( i.e.  other paths not directly associated with the return path ) while still ensuring that the walker returns to the original vertex .",
    "finally , the rwr : not attribute ensures that the walker does not return to a _",
    "previously seen vertex .",
    "if vertex @xmath18 is the head of the path ( i.e.  source ) , then it is defined in an rwr : entrycontext .",
    "if vertex @xmath19 is the tail of the path ( i.e.  sink ) , then it is defined in an rwr : exitcontext .",
    "the purpose of the walker is to move from source to sink in @xmath10 by respecting the rwr : rules and rwr : attributes of the rwr : contexts that it traverses in @xmath24 .",

    "moreover , the walker must be able to query @xmath24 in order to know which rwr : rules and rwr : attributes to respect .",
    "the mechanism by which the walker queries @xmath10 and @xmath24 is called the symbol binding model .",

    "this section presents another example of the grammar - based geodesic algorithm . in this example",
    ", the grammar presented is equivalent to removing the edge labels and directionality from the semantic network and calculating a traditional geodesic metric on it .",
    "figure [ fig : path2-example ] presents the grammar where , in rdfs , rdfs : resource is the base type of all resources ( vertices and edge labels ) .",

    "the central rwr : context is the rdfs : resource_1 context .",
    "a walker will loop over rwr : resource_1 until it can find an edge to make the final traversal to lanl : norman . note the use of both rwr : outedges ( + ) and rwr : inedges ( - ) .",
    "with both edges accessible , the walker can walk in any direction on the network .",
    "thus , this grammar is equivalent to executing a geodesic on an undirected and unlabeled version of the semantic network .",
    "finally , the grammar will produce no recurrent paths because of the rwr : notever_1 rule .    given this @xmath24 and the original social network instance @xmath10 diagrammed in figure [ fig : social - instance ] , the shortest path between lanl : johan and lanl : norman is @xmath183lanl : johan , lanl : contacted ,  , lanl : norman@xmath95 with a path length of @xmath43 .",
    "to contrast , in the first example when the walker s path was constrained to researcher friendship relationships , the shortest path between lanl : johan and lanl : norman was @xmath161 .",
    "the semantic network is an unweighted network .",
    "thus , determining the shortest path between any two vertices is best solved by a breadth - first algorithm .",
    "the grammar - based walker , through cloning , is analogous to a breadth - first search through the network .",
    "however , not all edges are considered by the walker and thus , the running time of the algorithm is less than or equal to @xmath184 .",
    "the determination of the running time of the algorithm is grammar dependent . in order to calculate the running time of a particular grammar , it is important to calculate the number of vertices and edges of the grammar - specified types in @xmath10 . in the worst case situation ,",
    "the walker population @xmath84 will have traversed all vertices and edges from the source to ultimately locate the sink . however , because the network is unweighted , once the sink has been found by a single @xmath185 , the shortest path has been determined so the algorithm is complete .",
    "once a computation has been performed , its results can be reused as a sub - solution to a larger problem . as stated previously ,",
    "the path calculations between two vertices in a network are the kernel calculations for more complex path metrics such as shortest path , eccentricity , radius , diameter , closeness centrality , and betweenness centrality .",
    "this section will demonstrate how to encode the @xmath89 data structure into a semantic network such that the results of these calculations can be reused for each of the higher - order metrics .",
    "for instance , suppose the function @xmath186 , where @xmath187 .",
    "furthermore , suppose that there exist the resources `` 1''@xmath188@xmath188xsd : int and `` 2''@xmath188@xmath188xsd : int such that there also exists the triple @xmath189 the triple states , in human language , that the number @xmath43 is related to the number @xmath161 by the functional relationship @xmath190 . if that triple is in @xmath10 , then never again would it be necessary to compute @xmath191 because the result has already been computed and has been represented in @xmath10 .",
    "thus , @xmath10 can be queried for the result of the @xmath191 computation . for example , @xmath192 would return the result of @xmath191 .",
    "however , this is a trivial example because it is faster to compute @xmath191 on the local hardware processor then it is to query @xmath10 for the solution . in other situations ,",
    "this is not necessarily the case .    for more complex computations , such as the set of paths between two vertices in @xmath4 according to some @xmath24 ,",
    "it is possible to represent @xmath80 and its associated data structure @xmath89 as a semantic network .",
    "figure [ fig : georw ] is a diagram of the rdfs ontology representing @xmath80 and @xmath89 , where the noted components are considered either named graphs @xcite , separate semantic network instances , or reified sub - networks @xcite . from instances of this ontology , it is possible to reuse the path calculations to determine various geodesics without recalculating the @xmath24-correct paths between any two vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "encoding @xmath80 and its associated @xmath89 data structure in a semantic network.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    for example , given the @xmath193 path calculated in section [ sec : first - example ] , the semantic network representation would be represented as diagrammed in figure [ fig : georw - example ] . the number of rwr : segments is the largest rdfs : containermembershipproperty ( i.e.  rdf:_3 ) for the rwr : path .",
    "the path length of @xmath193 is thus , @xmath194 ( i.e.  @xmath195 ) . to make the mapping to the convention used in section [ sec : first - example ] more salient , note the rwr : segment component labels at the bottom of the diagram .",
    "an instance of the rdfs ontology in figure [ fig : georw].,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    if the grammar - based path algorithm halts when it reaches an rwr : exitcontext , then every @xmath89 instance is a shortest path .",
    "while only the shortest path between two vertices is required for geodesic metrics , the next subsections present the generalized algorithm for searching all @xmath89 paths between source vertex @xmath18 and sink vertex @xmath19 .      to compute the shortest path between two vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the complete set @xmath84 is searched , the grammar - based shortest path algorithm is represented as @xmath196 where @xmath197 and the function @xmath198 returns the smallest value of the second component of its domain minus the rdf : _ head .",
    "for example , if @xmath199 , then @xmath200 .",
    "the first rwr : path element is used later when calculating the betweenness centrality of a vertex .",
    "the @xmath201 query simply returns the path identifier and the number of segments of each path between the rwr : entrycontext and the rwr : exitcontext .",
    "more specifically , the query that generates @xmath201 can be understood , in human language , as saying :  given the set of all rwr : geodesicwalkers ( @xmath202 ) that use @xmath24 as their grammar and who have a @xmath203-path ( @xmath204 ) that has @xmath18 as the vertex of the first ( i.e.  rdf:_1 ) rwr : segment ( @xmath205 ) , where @xmath18 is the rwr : entrycontext vertex of @xmath24 ( @xmath206 ) and who have @xmath19 in a @xmath203-path rwr : segment ( @xmath207 ) , where @xmath19 is the rwr : exitcontext vertex of @xmath24 ( @xmath208 ) , return the rwr : path ( @xmath204 ) and the rwr : segment count ( @xmath209 ) of the @xmath19 rwr : segment . \"",
    "given the shortest path query , it is possible to generate other grammar - based geodesics .",
    "for instance , for eccentricity , @xmath210    for radius , @xmath211    finally , for diameter , @xmath212      for closeness centrality , @xmath213    finally , for betweenness centrality , if @xmath214 , where @xmath215 returns the set of shortest paths in its domain and @xmath216 represents the set of shortest paths from @xmath19 to @xmath62 such that there exists some rwr : segment in the rwr : path that has @xmath18 as its vertex , then @xmath217    to calculate the betweenness centrality of vertex @xmath18 , it is important to know the number of shortest paths that go from @xmath19 to @xmath62 as well as the number of shortest paths that go from @xmath19 to @xmath62 through @xmath18 .",
