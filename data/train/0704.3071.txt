    "somites are transient structures that form a periodic growing pattern starting from the head ( anterior ) and extending to the tail ( posterior ) of a developing vertebrate embryo which ultimately give rise to both the segmented vertebral column and to the musculature .",
    "formation of somites is a rhythmic process characteristic of the species at given temperature .",
    "for instance , in the chicken embryo one pair of somites is formed every 90 min at 37 @xmath0 and in the zebrafish one pair is formed roughly every 30 min at 28 @xmath0 . the origin of these intracellular oscillations have been identified as due to time delays in the transcription and translation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 genes in the case of zebrafish and the @xmath3 gene in the case of mouse . the total number of somites produced is conserved within a given species typically somewhere between 50 to 70 pairs of somites form on each side of the anterior - posterior ( ap ) axis , but can vary dramatically between species , thus the zebrafish develops 30 pairs of somites . as new somites bud from the anterior end of the presomatic mesoderm ( psm ) that extends back to the primitive streak and tail bud , new cells are added at the posterior end by cell division from the tail bud keeping the size of the psm constant as new somites are generated .",
    "somitogenesis is one of the best studied process of pattern formation in the developing embryo , and a number of models have been proposed to address the mechanisms underlying the generation of such periodic patterns @xcite : the clock and wavefront model proposed by coke and zeeman in 1976 is perhaps best known , but others include meinhardt s reaction diffusion model ; and stern s cell cycle model . all of them suppose that oscillations of genes and gene products occur in the cells of the psm from which the somites derive ( fig .",
    "[ somites ] ) .",
    "the clock and wavefront model postulates the existence of a longitudinal positional information gradient down the axis of vertebrate embryos .",
    "this gradient interacts with the cellular oscillator stopping the oscillations and producing a rapid change in locomotory and adhesive behavior of cells when they form somites @xcite .",
    "the oscillation in the psm is the somite clock , and the moving interfaces at the anterior end of the psm where the positional information reaches a critical value is called the wavefront .",
    "it is the interaction beween the clock phase and the positional information that controls somitogenesis .",
    "here we suppose the positional information is supplied by the concentration gradient of the gene product fgf8 released at the tail bud of the embryo and creating a linear gradient of morphogen along the ap axis @xcite .",
    "biologically the signal created by the fgf8 concentration interacts with the clock phase ( the intracellular concentration of a gene protein ) leading to cell differentiation and somite formation . at low fgf8 concentration ,",
    "cell arrangement becomes more compact and the epithelialization process underlying somite formation begins .",
    "meinhardt s reaction diffusion model also incorporates the idea of an oscillatory mechanism in the psm cells producing an alteration between cell states as in the clock and wavefront model .",
    "one of the main aims of this model is to account for somite structure itself which at even early stages after formation shows heterogeneities between the anterior and posterior portion of an individual somite . to account for this structure",
    "the reaction diffusion model postulates that cells can be in one of two possible states : anterior @xmath4 and posterior @xmath5 and switch from one state to another until they reach a stable state in the presence of a morphogen gradient forming a spatial pattern such as @xmath6 , where a repeated segment @xmath7 constitutes a somite .",
    "finally stern s cell cycle model assumes that the oscillations in the cells arranged along the ap axis are in synchrony with each other , but cells in the anterior psm are further advanced in phase than cells in the posterior psm .",
    "segmentation is hypothesised to occur when cells reach a certain time window in their cell cycle .",
    "the most important point raised by this model is the question of how cells are synchronized biologically .",
    "it appears that the answer to this question lies in the @xmath8 gene that codes for the notch ligand at the heart of the intercellular notch signalling pathway which when disrupted destroys cell cycle synchrony@xcite .",
    "all these models raise important questions , but recent experiments on how fgf8 signalling controls somite boundary position and regulates the segmentation clock @xcite appears most in accord with the clock and wavefront model .    based in the clock and wavefront model combined with key ingredients of the known biology",
    ", we have therefore constructed a deterministic one dimensional model and compare the resulting spatial patterning with the somites for zebrafish embryo .",
    "we use in our model the recent proposal for the mechanism producing the intracellular oscillations as due to delays in the synthesis of mrna focussing specifically on the zebrafish genes @xmath1 and @xmath2 and their gene products the protein molecules her1 and her7 @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : section [ model ] is devoted to the description of the proposed model and contains the results derived from it .",
    "the transcription in the synthesis of mrna is essentially a noisy process and is considered for haploid cells in the section [ haploid ] . in section",
    "[ irregular ] , we study the effect of a local perturbation of the fgf8 wavefront on the spatial pattern of somites . finally a conclusion and discussion is presented in [ conclusions ] . +",
    "the model consists initially of a linear array of @xmath9 cells that represents the starting size of the psm with intracellular oscillators driven by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 genes and their associated gene product proteins .",

    "sustained oscillations of mrna and proteins are obtained for parameters and time delays @xmath17 and @xmath18 close to the zebrafish estimated ones as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ temporal ] @xcite .",
    "the mrna and protein oscillations can occur without interactions between neighbor cells , because the delays that take part in feedback loops are intracellular .",
    "the interactions through @xmath22 connecting neighbor cells are , however , crucial as they result in synchronous in phase oscillations in the linear array representing the psm as a whole to occur .",
    "+ we suppose at time @xmath59 all the cells in the starting psm to be oscillating in phase , and therefore we begin with the linear array of @xmath9 cells and integrate them for the time necessary to obtain coherent synchronous oscillations . in this paper @xmath60 , and in its synchronous oscillating state it represents the time @xmath59 in our model .",
    "the growth of the psm is simulated in our model by the adding of new cells to the initial group of cells at one end of the linear array .",
    "this growth velocity @xmath61 is a variable parameter in our model , and we chose to add cells at a rate of one cell every @xmath62 minutes in agreement with measured growth rates  @xcite .",
    "thus , it generates sequentially along the antero - posterior axis the necessary cells for forming the future segments of the embryo : the somites that are created at the anterior portion of the psm , see fig .",
    "[ somites ] . in our simulations",
    "once the initial psm has been obtained as a group of cells oscillating in phase , the caudal motion of the wavefront starts . again",
    "the wavefront velocity @xmath63 is a parameter in the model that controls the rate at which cells reached by the wavefront stop oscillating and thus freezing the gene and gene product concentrations at their values when they meet the wavefront ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ temporal ] ) .",
    "the observed spatial shift in the phases of different cells is thus obtained by the wavefront catching different phases when passing through different cells , a biological implementation of the clock and wavefront model .",
    "what value should we choose for @xmath63 ?",
    "the simplest argument would suggest @xmath64 .",
    "this supposes that the fgf creates a time indepedent distribution on a fast timescale compared to growth , and therefore the wavefront is simply reading off a critical value of the fgf concentration at which the intracellular oscillator is frozen . if we chose this value , however , we would not create around @xmath65 somites in @xmath66 minutes as we would expect  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is important to note that the regularity of the somite pattern and the size of somites is very sensitive to changes in @xmath9 and @xmath63 .",
    "for example , if @xmath67 and @xmath68 min per cell , the number of somites is about 10 for 900 minutes . here",
    "we report instead on our simulations with @xmath69 minutes per cell .",
    "then when the simulation finishes in the time @xmath55 minutes we find that @xmath70 somite pairs have been created .",
    "a wavefront advancing at a rate of 1cell/2 minutes creates a spatial wavelength @xmath71 cells in length .",
    "what is the process of cell differentiation after the cell meets the wavefront now depends on the biology . here to be specific we have assumed that when the @xmath53 level is above its average value a somite is formed .",
    "averages of the concentrations of proteins and mrna of the frozen cells are calculated at this final time . with this choice",
    "a somite is roughly @xmath72 cells in length .",
    "on the other hand the neighbor cells that have protein and mrna concentrations lower than average form the space between somites . with this choice",
    "the remaining @xmath73 cells form an intersomite gap .",
    "of course , it is also possible to interpret the simulation as forming somites of length @xmath74 cells with a differentiated structure between the anterior and posterior portions of each somite . now as the simulation proceeds the psm reduces in size . indeed , for the parameters chosen here @xmath60 cells , but @xmath75cells ,",
    "because while @xmath76 cells are added in the @xmath66 minutes of the simulation at the posterior end of the psm , a total of @xmath77 cells differentiate into new somites , it is not surprising therefore that phase coherence is lost towards the end of somitogenesis , and the spatial array of somites obtained , though approximately periodic , decrease in size towards the tail ( fig .",
    "[ sin ] ) .",
    "our simulations above assumed that no noise was present in the cells during transcription and translation , but as lewis has pointed out , the transcription step involved in protein synthesis is essentially a stochastic process because of the small number of molecules involved in the cell @xcite : a dna molecule can randomly have a her1 , her7 or delta notch dimer bound to its regulatory site .",
    "when such a dimer does bind , transcription is forbidden ; whereas if no protein is bound at a regulation site of the dna molecule , transcription occurs at the possible maximal rate .    the stochastic model for haploid cells is then constructed by taking the deterministic one dimensional model and considering the possible states ( bound and dissociated ) of all regulatory sites of the @xmath1 , @xmath78 and @xmath8 genes as stochastic variables @xcite .",
