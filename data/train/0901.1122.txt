    "interesting electric transport properties of the dirac quasiparticles of graphene have recently come under focus.geim,neto,novoselov,novoselov2,zhang graphene , which consists of a single layer of carbon atoms in a bi - partite honeycomb lattice , has a unique band structure that includes two inequivalent valleys in the first brillouin zone of the momentum space . in gapless graphene ,",
    "the valleys are characterized by the conduction and the valence bands touching each other at zero energy . near the valleys , the appropriate quasiparticle dispersion relations are linear in momentum , similar to those of massless dirac quasiparticles .",
    "inter - valley - scattering is generally suppressed @xcite , and will be ignored here , due to the absence of a large enough scattering wavevector mixing the two dirac points .    in some graphene samples , e.g. , epitaxial graphene on sic substrate ,",
    "a sizable gap has been reported @xcite in the quasiparticle spectrum near the dirac points .",
    "since the gap approaches zero with increasing sample thickness , it has been attributed to the effects due to the substrate , which is believed to break the sublattice ( hence , the space inversion ( si ) ) symmetry.@xcite note that a quasiparticle gap in graphene can also result from confined geometries such as in the graphene nanoribbons.kim1,sarma in bilayer graphene , an applied interlayer voltage bias can lead to a gap due to broken si symmetry.@xcite in such systems , the effects of the momentum space berry curvature,@xcite which is sharply peaked at the two valleys , give rise to non - trivial , topological , electric transport phenomena.@xcite in this paper , we discuss the effects of the topological berry phases on another class of transport coefficients , the thermoelectric response coefficients .",
    "we will focus , in particular , on the topological nernst effect of gapped graphene . in light of the recent successful measurements of the regular thermoelectric coefficients in graphene,@xcite the anomalous , topological nernst response we discuss here",
    "acquires particular relevance and importance .",
    "although the specific calculations in this paper apply to graphene samples with broken si symmetry , they should , more generally , be qualitatively valid in the presence of a gap of any origin near the dirac points . note that an energy gap is ultimately essential for use of graphene as an electronic material .",
    "we calculate the berry phase supported , spontaneous ( _ i.e. , _ it exists even without an external magnetic field ) nernst effect of the low energy quasiparticles in graphene , and show that it is non - zero for a non - zero valley polarization in the sample .",
    "while a non - zero valley polarization can be artificially created,@xcite it can also be induced by an applied magnetic field itself in a generic nernst measurement set up.@xcite the regular nernst effect in gapped graphene may , therefore , have a substantial anomalous contribution because of the induced valley polarization . even in the absence of any valley polarization , the spontaneous nernst signals are non - zero from the individual valleys , but are equal and opposite to each other",
    "so the total signal is zero .",
    "therefore , they can be used to create a non - zero valley polarization on the transverse edges , which can be technologically important .    in recent experiments ,",
    "thermoelectric coefficients , in particular , the nernst coefficient , have been measured for non - zero transverse magnetic fields in gapless graphene.@xcite the topological nernst effect we discuss here exists even in the absence of any external magnetic field ; it is solely driven by the effective magnetic field , given by the berry curvature , near the valley centers in the momentum space . in the thermoelectric experiments ,",
    "a temperature gradient @xmath0 , applied along , say , the @xmath1 direction produces a measurable transverse electric field .",
    "the total charge current in the presence of the electric field @xmath2 and @xmath0 is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electric and the thermoelectric conductivity tensors , respectively .",
    "setting @xmath6 to zero , the nernst signal , defined as @xmath7 , is measured , where @xmath8 is the nernst conductivity defined via the relation @xmath9 in the absence of the electric field , @xmath10 is the longitudinal resistance , @xmath11 is the thermopower , and @xmath12 is the hall angle . if the second term is small , which is sometimes the case,@xcite @xmath13 completely defines the nernst signal , but in the most general case one should extract @xmath8 from the experimental data to compare with our calculations .    in this paper ,",
    "the berry phase mediated topological contribution to @xmath14 is calculated through two different approaches . in the first , path integral , method , we first compute the frequency - dependent off - diagonal component of the electric conductivity tensor , @xmath15 , for the dirac quasiparticles in graphene . at low temperatures ,",
    "the nernst conductivity @xmath8 can be related to the zero temperature dc hall conductivity @xmath16 through the mott relation,@xcite eq .",
    "this method has the advantage that it produces , as a by - product , the imaginary part of the ac hall conductivity , @xmath17 , which can be related to the possible polar kerr effect victor , tewari in graphene .",
    "indeed , in the case of a non - zero valley - index polarization in the sample , the berry phase induced polar kerr effect will be non - zero and observable .",
    "another advantage of this method is that it can give a neat analytical expression of the nernst conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "the effects of quasiparticle nonlinear dispersion relations on the topological transport properties of graphene have also been discussed in this framework .",
    "this method , however , is approximate , and gives the values of the nernst coefficient only at low enough temperatures . in a more general method , which is valid also at higher temperatures , the anomalous contribution to @xmath8",
    "can be calculated from the coefficient @xmath18 , which determines the transverse heat current @xmath19 in response to an electric field @xmath2 : @xmath20 .",
    "the coefficients are related by one of the onsager relations : @xmath21.@xcite this way of computing @xmath8 makes use of the berry curvature in the graphene band structure ( see eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) ) more directly .",
    "it is a much more general method , which we have used in our plots for the nernst coefficient as a function of temperature in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "using this method , we have been able to go beyond the linear temperature dependence arising out of the mott relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii gives the dirac - like hamiltonian for single layer graphene .",
    "section iii is devoted to the topological hall conductivity of single layer graphene .",
    "we calculate the ac hall conductivity @xmath15 using the path integral approach and discuss the possible polar kerr effect for single layer graphene . in the limit @xmath22 , we obtain the dc hall conductivity .",

    "v , we calculate the topological nernst conductivity @xmath8 via both the mott relation and the transverse heat current coefficient .",
    "we do this for both single and bilayer graphene .",
    "finally , section vi is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in the tight - binding approximation , graphene single layer with staggered sublattice potential ( which breaks the space inversion symmetry ) can be modeled with the nearest - neighbor hopping energy @xmath23 and a site energy difference @xmath24 between the sublattices , @xcite @xmath25where",
