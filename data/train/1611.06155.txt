    "existing optical long - baseline interferometers provide information at angular scales a factor of 10 smaller than any existing or planed single aperture telescope .",
    "this is achieved by measuring interference fringes from pairs of telescopes .",
    "the fringes contrast and position at the detector can be related to the spatial coherence of the incoming electromagnetic field , which in turn contains information on the object brightness distribution ( cf.e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "this makes an imaging interferometer very different from an imaging camera .",
    "the first difference is related to the information content .",
    "a camera generates an image from a continuous sampled pupil , while an interferometer only obtains information at a much smaller number of specific locations of an effective `` meta - pupil ''  the so - called @xmath1-coverage of the data .",
    "a second difference is that while in a camera all the information is obtained simultaneously , in an interferometer data is taken from diverse array combinations separated in time .",
    "finally , for an interferometer an algorithm must be used to synthesise an image .    in optical long - baseline interferometry , phase information degradation by atmospheric turbulence is normally overcome by phase closure triangulation ( e.g.,@xcite ) , at the expense of further reducing the information content of the measurement .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the first optical long - baseline images were of binaries ( morphological simple objects ) and were first obtained with three telescopes ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the publication of the first relevant results , the technique of image reconstruction of long - baseline interferometric data in the optical / infrared ( o / ir , 0.420 ) regime has evolved and it is nowadays well established .",
    "a major breakthrough in optical long - baseline interferometry was the availability of the chara and vlti arrays @xcite coupled to the control of atmospheric effects with spatial filtering @xcite and adaptive optics ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . by combining three or more telescopes and reasonable @xmath1-coverages , the information content allowed to overcome the binary barrier and",
    "enter into more complex morphologies such as stellar surfaces and discs ( e.g.,@xcite ) .    because of the low information content of interferometric data , the generation of images is an ill - posed problem with more unknowns than available data .",
    "therefore , images are reconstructed by minimizing a cost function that includes both the data and some prior information on the object brightness distribution ( e.g.,@xcite ) . to overcome the effects of the turbulence ,",
    "optical long - baseline interferometry data traditionally relies on the closure phase ( and not on the baseline phase ) .",
    "the non - convex nature of the problem makes image reconstruction a difficult task , and algorithms are still matter of active research ( cf.@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the availability of dispersed fringes increased the information content of interferometry data , enabling spectral self - calibration ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "other developments are algorithms joining imaging and parametric descriptions of the astronomical objects ( e.g.,@xcite ) , or different types of regularisation @xcite .    with the advent of _ gravity _ at eso , the first common instrument allowing phase referencing observations @xcite , most of the aperture synthesis algorithms may be simplified , because when a reference source is available , the phase closure is no longer required to remove atmospheric effects and the baseline phase becomes accessible .",
    "standard radio interferometry approaches have proved successfully with simulated data in this context ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the large variety of aperture synthesis methods naturally leads to the question on which is the best approach . in 2001 , the working group on optical interferometry of the international astronomical union ( iau ) decided to compare and promote the development of different algorithms to restore o / ir interferometric images , on a regular basis . starting in 2004 ,",
    "an  imaging beauty contest \" has been held by spie every two years @xcite , where contestants present blindly restored images from synthetic or observational data provided by the organisation of the contest .",
    "they are also asked to interpret the results , indicating what is believed to be real features and what are the potential artefacts of the imaging process .",
    "subsequently , the restored images obtained from the different software are compared to their corresponding reference images by means of a best - fit method .",
    "this method typically comprises a resampling of the restored image to the grid of the reference one , the normalisation of the restored image to its peak brightness , and the comparison with the reference image convolved with the effective point spread function ( psf ) of the interferometer , using a root - mean - square agreement .",
    "however , this approach is limited , because a particular metric might favour a special algorithm for a specific object morphology .",
    "this is a pertinent objection which , to our knowledge , is not addressed in the literature .",
    "the work presented here addresses this very question : how can we equitably measure the quality of an image obtained in aperture synthesis ?",
    "this is a topic of relevance not only for algorithms , but also to the scientific exploitation of aperture synthesis , and for any future infrastructure relying on aperture synthesis imaging , such as the planet formation imager ( @xcite ) .",
    "this article is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : image_quality ] , we review merit functions used for image quality assessment , and we select a few for further analysis . it is underlined that image convolution with an effective psf is mandatory . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we present the methods we used to recover the interferometric images , explaining how we generate the observables and respective noise , how we restored the images , and how we assess their quality .",
    "important aspects of this approach are ( _ a _ ) both phase closure and phase referencing techniques are addressed , and ( _ b _ ) the array configurations are selected from available stations at the vlti , particularly the case for 4 telescopes using phase closure , where the configurations are the ones used with the _ pionier _ instrument . section  [ sec : results ] concerns about the reconstructed images and the analysis of the behaviour of the selected merit functions .",
    "we discuss the results and provide a summary of our findings .",
    "the most surprising outcome is that the metric used in the `` imaging beauty contest '' is biased , but it can be replaced by a simple metric .",
    "a side bonus of our approach is that it paves the way for image quality assessment without human intervention . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude and present directions for future developments .",
    "the quality of an image has to be assessed by an objective quantitative criterion .",
    "what is the best criterion also largely depends on the context . here",
    "we will assume that the _ metric _ @xmath2 is used to estimate the discrepancy between a reconstructed image @xmath3 and a reference image @xmath4 . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we also assume that the lower @xmath2 the better the agreement between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , @xmath2 can be thought as a measure of the distance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    when assessing image quality it is important that the result does not depend on irrelevant changes .",
    "this however depends on the type of images and on the context .",
    "for instance , for object detection or recognition , the image metric should be insensitive to the background level , to a geometrical transform ( translation , rotation , magnification , ifnextchar.etcetc . ) or to a multiplication of the brightness by some positive factor which does not affect the shape of the object . in cases where image reconstruction has underdeterminations , these should not have any incidence on the metric . for optical interferometry and when only power - spectrum and closure phase data are available , the images to be compared may have to be shifted for best matching . in general , the metric should be minimized with respect to the undetermined parameters .    when comparing a true image @xmath5 ( with potentially an infinitely high resolution ) to a restored image @xmath3 , the effective resolution achievable by the instrument and the image restoration process must be taken into account .",
    "otherwise and because image metrics are in general based on pixel - wise comparisons , the slightest displacement of sharp features would lead to large loss of quality ( according to the metric ) whereas the images may look very similar at a lower and more realistic resolution .",
    "the easiest solution is then to define the reference image @xmath4 to be the true image @xmath5 blurred by an effective psf @xmath6 , whose shape corresponds to the effective resolution @xmath7 where symbol @xmath8 denotes the convolution .",
    "the choice of the effective resolution is then a parameter of the metric .    to summarise and to be specific , using the distance @xmath2 between the restored image @xmath3 and the reference image @xmath4 , the discrepancy between @xmath3 and the true image @xmath5 would be given by : @xmath9 with @xmath10 a brightness scale , @xmath11 a background , and @xmath12 a matching psf of width parameter to be the standard deviation of the psf profile . ] @xmath13 and centred at position @xmath14 .",
    "note that the merit function should be minimized with respect to the width @xmath15 of the effective psf in order to estimate the effective resolution achieved by a given restored image .",
    "our choice to assigning the translation to the matching psf is to avoid relying on some particular method to perform sub - pixel interpolation ( of @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) for fine tuning the position .",
    "not doing so would add another ingredient to the metric .",
    "when dealing with images with different pixel sizes , the resampling of the images at a given common resolution can be implemented by a linear operator which performs at the same time the resampling , the fine shifting and the blurring by one of the psfs .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we first review the most common metrics found in the literature and argue whether they are appropriate or not in the context of optical interferometry .",
    "we then propose a family of suitable metrics .",
    "quadratic merit functions are probably the most widely used ones , for they are easy to manipulate and can be made insensitive to various effects , such as an affine change in the image levels ( see section  [ sec : affine - correction ] ) .",
    "even though it is not always obvious , they are , in fact , related to various metrics proposed for comparing images .",
    "compared to the kullback - leibler divergence ( see section  [ sec : kl ] ) , quadratic merit functions amount to assuming a simple distribution of the differences between two images ( that is to say , independent and gaussian ) .",
    "the most general expression of a quadratic metric to measure the discrepancy between two images @xmath3 and @xmath4 takes the form of a weighted ( squared ) @xmath16-norm : @xmath17 where we denote by @xmath18 the weighted squared euclidean norm , with @xmath19 a positive ( semi-)definite weighting operator .",
    "using a diagonal weighting operator @xmath20 yields : @xmath21 where the sum is carried out for all pixels of the images and where the @xmath22 is the weight of pixel @xmath23 .    by choosing specific weights , it is possible to mimic a number of commonly used metrics .",
    "for instance , the metric of the _ interferometric imaging beauty contest _",
    "@xcite is @xmath24^{1/2 } ,              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which amounts to taking the weights as being proportional to the reference .",
    "the main drawbacks of this merit function are that it overemphasises the brighter regions of the image and discards pixels where the reference image @xmath4 is zero , which occurs for many pixels for a compact astronomical source on a dark background . for these reasons",
    ", we anticipate that @xmath25 may not be the best metric .",
    "the most simple quadratic metric is the squared @xmath16-norm ( also known as the _ squared euclidean norm _ ) of the pixel - wise differences between the images : @xmath26 which is @xmath27 when @xmath28 .",
    "mean squared error _ ( mse ) is directly derived from the euclidean norm by taking @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the number of pixels : @xmath31 the mse was used by @xcite to benchmark the effects of the regularisation in the image reconstruction from interferometric data .",
    "for all the metrics presented so far , the smaller the merit value , the more similar are the images .    some other commonly used metrics are also based on the euclidean norm of the differences . for instance , the _ peak signal to noise ratio _ ( psnr ) is @xmath32 ^ 2 } { { \\ensuremath{\\text{mse}}}(x , y ) }                  \\right ) .\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 and @xmath34 correspond respectively to the minimum and maximum possible pixel value of the reference image @xmath4 .",
    "the psnr is given in decibel ( db ) units and the higher the psnr , the more similar are the images .",
    "clearly , mse and psnr are the squared euclidean norm of the pixel - wise difference between the images ( @xmath35 ) but expressed in different units . they can be used interchangeably and we will only consider @xmath25 and @xmath35 in what follows .      in order to make a formal link between different metrics , it is worth investigating what happens when the minimization with respect to the brightness distortion parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 is carried on . as we will show , this minimization has a closed form solution with a quadratic metric : @xmath36 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the images to compare , @xmath37 a positive factor , @xmath38 a constant background , and @xmath39 an image where all pixels are equal to 1 .",
    "let us first consider the constant background correction .",
    "introducing @xmath40 , we want to minimize @xmath41 with respect to @xmath11 . expanding the quadratic norm yields @xmath42",
    "this is a simple 2@xmath43 order polynomial in @xmath11 and the minimum is achieved for the optimal background @xmath44 which can be seen as a weighted averaging of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 where the linear operator @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the identity .",
    "the linear operator @xmath47 has the effect of removing the weighted average of its argument . replacing @xmath45 by @xmath50 yields : @xmath51 which amounts to comparing the weighted average subtracted images .",
    "the expansion @xmath52 readily shows that the optimal factor @xmath10 is @xmath53 and , after trivial simplifications , that @xmath54 putting all together we have shown that @xmath55 where the linear operator @xmath47 is given in equation  ( [ eq : centering - operator ] ) . if no background correction is wanted , it is sufficient to take @xmath56 .",
    "the above expression can be divided by @xmath57 to obtain a symmetric distance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 which is independent of an affine transform of the brightness of any of the two images @xmath58 with @xmath59 the ( weighted ) correlation between the two images @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if @xmath60 , then the usual definition of the correlation , given in equation  ( [ eq : correlation ] ) , is retrieved .",
    "the distance @xmath61 takes values in the range @xmath62 $ ] , the smaller it is the better is the agreement .",
    "conversely , the better the agreement the larger the absolute value of the ( weighted ) correlation .",
    "it is therefore clear now that comparing images by means of their ( weighted ) correlation coefficient is equivalent to using a quadratic norm minimized with respect to an affine transform of the image intensity .",
    "[ sec : ssim ] the _ universal image quality index _ was proposed by @xcite to overcome mse and psnr , which were found to be very poor estimators of the image quality for common brightness distortions and image corruptions ( like salt - and - pepper noise , lossy compression artefacts , ifnextchar.etcetc . ) .",
    "the universal image quality index is defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are respectively the empirical average , variance and covariance of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , given by : @xmath67 the universal image quality index takes values in the range @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "@xmath69 is maximal for the best agreement , which occurs when @xmath70 , and minimal when @xmath71 , for any @xmath72 and any @xmath11 .",
    "although the universal image quality index was designed to cope with brightness distortions such as mean shift or dynamic shrinkage , this indicator is not exactly insensitive to any affine transform of the intensity as is ( see the demonstration in section  [ sec : affine - correction ] ) the correlation coefficient : @xmath73 in order to improve over the universal image quality index , @xcite introduced the _ image structural similarity _",
    "( ssim ) : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are small values introduced to avoid divisions by zero .",
    "note that with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the ssim is just the image quality index defined in equation  ( [ eq : quality_index ] ) .",
    "the higher the ssim , the better the agreement . in principle",
    "ssim and the quality index should be used _ locally _ , that is on small regions of the images .      similarly to the ibc metric ,",
    "the _ accuracy function _ ( acc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is based on a normalised weighted quadratic difference between the reconstructed image @xmath3 and the reference image @xmath4 : @xmath79 here @xmath80 is a normalised weighting function , a mask that eliminates all pixels where the reference and the restored images have intensities smaller than the image s dynamic range . on all non - negligible pixels , @xmath80 is equal to 1 .",
    "acc varies between 0 and 1 and the smaller it is , the greater the resemblance between both images . note that the accuracy function is neither quadratic in @xmath3 nor in @xmath4 .",
    "one of the drawbacks of quadratic metrics is that they strongly emphasize the largest differences . to avoid this ,",
    "an @xmath81-norm can be used with an exponent @xmath82 .",
    "for instance , the _ sum of absolute differences _ or @xmath0-norm is given by : @xmath83      the _ fidelity function _ was introduced by @xcite in the context of image reconstruction for alma .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the total flux of the reference @xmath4 to the difference between the restored image @xmath3 and the reference one : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is some non - negative threshold .",
    "the higher the fidelity value , the better the agreement .",
    "choosing @xmath86 avoids divisions by zero , and @xcite took @xmath87 , where @xmath88 yields the root mean squared value of its argument .",
    "we note that with @xmath86 , all differences smaller than @xmath85 have the same incidence on the total cost and are therefore irrelevant . to avoid this",
    ", one has to take @xmath89 , in which case the reciprocal of the fidelity function is then just the @xmath0-norm defined in equation  ( [ eq : l1-norm ] ) times some constant factor which only depends on the reference @xmath4 . as the fidelity function",
    "would then yield the same results as the @xmath0-norm , we only consider the latter in our study .",
    "being non - negative everywhere and normalised , the images can be thought as distributions ( over the pixels ) .",
    "the _ kullback - leibler divergence _ measures the similarity between two distributions . when applied to our ( normalised ) ,",
    "images it writes @xmath90 a restriction for the kullback - leibler divergence is that @xmath3 and @xmath4 must be strictly positive everywhere .",
    "it is however possible to account for non - negative distributions by modifying the definition of the kullback - leibler divergence as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 extends @xmath93 by continuity : @xmath94 note that the kullback - leibler divergence is not symmetric , i.e.,@xmath95 .",
    "the kullback - leibler divergence is less or equal to zero .",
    "the lower the kullback - leibler divergence the worse is the agreement between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the maximal value of the kullback - leibler divergence is equal to zero and is achieved when @xmath96 .    like the ibc metric , the kullback - leibler divergence disregards @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , any image @xmath3 with at least one pixel , say @xmath99 , such that @xmath100 while @xmath101 yields @xmath102 , which corresponds to the maximum possible discrepancy .",
    "these are serious drawbacks for using the kullback - leibler divergence as an image metric , because it could not make a distinction between restored images such that @xmath100 , whatever the values of the other pixels .",
    "we want to derive an image metric that is adapted to our particular case : we consider images of compact objects ( i.e.,with finite size support ) over a constant background , and which may be shifted by an arbitrary translation .",
    "we assume that @xmath103 yields the discrepancy between the image @xmath3 and the image @xmath4 shifted by a translation @xmath14 .",
    "quite naturally , we require that the following properties hold :    * the metric does not change if the images are extended with pixels set with the background level ; likewise , the metric does not change if the images are truncated , provided that the values of the removed pixels equal the background level ; * the metric is non - negative and equal to zero if the two images are the same ( for a given relative translation ) ; in particular @xmath104 , whatever the image @xmath3 ; * the metric is _ stationary _ in the sense that whatever the images @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the translations @xmath14 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 where @xmath108 yields image @xmath3 shifted by translation @xmath14 : @xmath109    a last requirement , although optional , could be :    * the metric is _ symmetric _ in the sense that @xmath110 whatever the images @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the translation @xmath14 .    to limit the number of possibilities , we consider that the metric is the sum of a pixel - wise cost .",
    "then , accounting for property  ( _ i _ ) , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the number of dimensions of the images @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( in our case , @xmath113 ) , @xmath114 is the set of integers , @xmath115 is the considered translation , @xmath116 is the pixel - wise cost , and @xmath117 ( resp .",

    "we also note that property  ( _ iv _ ) implies that the pixel - wise cost be a symmetric function , i.e.,@xmath124 whatever @xmath125 .",
    "finally , property  ( _ iii _ ) holds because the same pixel - wise cost is used whatever the index @xmath23 .    as @xmath126 , the sum over the infinite set @xmath127 in equation  ( [ eq : additive_metric ] ) simplifies to sums over three finite ( and possibly empty ) subsets : @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes the set of elements of @xmath130 which do not belong to @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is the set of indices @xmath23 such that @xmath133 belongs to the support of @xmath3 .",

    ": @xmath139 finally , it remains to choose the pixel - wise cost @xmath140 .",
    "a whole family of merit functions can be derived with the following pixel - wise cost @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a chosen exponent and @xmath143 is a function used to emphasise the discrepancy in the low / high range of the brightness distribution .",

    "taking @xmath146 and @xmath147 yields the @xmath16-norm ( @xmath148 ) ; while taking the quadratic merit @xmath149 and @xmath147 yields the @xmath0-norm ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "incidently , this shows that the required aforementioned properties ( including the symmetry ) do hold for these norms .",
    "we already mentioned that not all merit functions reviewed in this paper are appropriate for comparing synthetic aperture images .",
    "for example , we disregarded the kullback - leibler divergence ( see section  [ sec : kl ] ) because of its inability to distinguish between very different images which have pixels equal to zero while they are non - zero in the reference image . in our context , the background level is known ( i.e.,@xmath151 which corresponds to the positivity constraint ) and should not have to be adjusted when comparing images . the universal quality index and image structural similarity described in section  [ sec : ssim ]",

    "the values of the quality functions show that ibc mimics the behaviour of l2n in most objects and configurations .",

    "the first result is that , generally , the merit functions are reasonably convex ( i.e.,they depict regions with a clear minima ) .",
    "overall , the effective resolution worsens with the hyper - parameter @xmath169 , as expected ( i.e.,the dark regions bend towards larger values of @xmath15 and @xmath169 ) .",

    "[ fig : merit_plots__cluster ] to [ fig : merit_plots__star ] depends on the object . in the case of the stellar cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : merit_plots__cluster ] ) , the minima regions exhibit an horizontal branch up to a certain level of regularisation . this is compatible with the aforementioned limiting value of regularisation , below which restored images present no noticeable differences in quality and the ( super-)resolution becomes limited by the size of the pixel .",
    "a single pixel encompasses the totality of the flux emanating from a restored unresolved star lying inside of it .",
    "the value of @xmath198mas indicated by the branch is compatible with the pixel size of 0.25mas .",
    "for sources with extended emission , the branch is not visible because the image degrades rapidly below a certain level of regularisation ( cf.figs .  [",
    "fig : reconstructions_b - yso ] and [ fig : reconstructions_c - star ] for some examples ) .",
    "nevertheless , regions of minima are also evident , the position of which largely depends on the merit function .      for l1n ,",
    "the global minima typically lie well inside the limits defined by the plots .",
    "that is not the case for many l2n and ibc observations ( especially for the cluster and yso ) , suggesting that if the study was extended to larger values of @xmath15 and @xmath169 , the global minima would point to more blurred images .",
    "the minima valley oriented in the direction of increasing @xmath169 and @xmath15 is less pronounced for l1n than for l2n and ibc . for l2n and ibc , this would indicate a better agreement between the restored and the reference images in those extreme regions of the plots , where the restored images are more blurred .",
    "this clearly shows that these metrics are biased and are not robust to over - smoothing by large values of the @xmath169 hyper - parameter .",
    "they will consider that an image with lower `` angular resolution '' is a better image than one with higher `` angular resolution '' .",
    "these results support l1n as the most robust of the merit functions used for the variety of cases considered .",
    "the morphology of the object has some impact on the behaviour of the metrics .",
    "the quality of extended resolved objects can be more easily assessed than that of unresolved sources .",
    "when the emitting source combines both type of objects ( resolved and unresolved ) , the studied merit functions seem to have a harder job to evaluate the quality of the restored images .",
    "the great imbalance in intensity between the central star and the surrounding disc might explain the differences in quality .",
    "the distance between the pink stars ( minima obtained from human selection ) and the circled red crosses ( global minima ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : merit_plots__cluster ] to [ fig : merit_plots__star ] indicate how well a given merit function translates the human perception of a `` good '' restored image . in this",
    "regard , l1n is clearly the best of all studied metrics , as it is the only one where both beacons lie close together for the typology of objects and observing configurations .",
    "this is not as well verified with the other metrics , being ibc the less robust of the tested merit functions . in the case of the stellar photosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : merit_plots__star ] ) , all metrics behave similarly .",
    "since we are truncating the intervals of @xmath15 and @xmath169 , those distances most probably would increase in the cases where the global minima lie at extreme points of the plots .",
    "these results open the possibility of automatic image quality assessment , thus removing human intervention in the process .",
    "this article addresses the question : what is the best metric to assess the quality of a reconstructed image ?",
    "several merit functions are considered in the realistic context of the very large telescope interferometer and using the image reconstruction software .",
    "a semi - automatic pipeline is developed to reconstruct images , with the only human intervention being the determination of the final value of the hyper - parameter @xmath169 .",
    "it is found that the image reconstruction process outputs images with an effective angular resolution , characterized by a gaussian , whose standard deviation @xmath15 is significantly smaller than an equivalent rayleigh - like criterion , based on the maximum baseline .",
    "hence , a certain amount of super - resolution is achievable thanks to the constraints imposed by a regularised image reconstruction algorithm .    in order to cope with the mismatch between the effective resolution of the restored image and that of the simulated object",
    ", we advocate that convolution by an effective psf is mandatory for proper image quality assessment .",
    "this effective psf can be further used to compensate for image shift , which is unavoidable when image reconstruction is performed from power - spectrum and phase closure data .",
    "of all the merit functions considered , the @xmath0-norm is the most robust .",
    "the commonly used interferometric imaging beauty contest quadratic metric is biased , considering as best images those with higher smoothing ( or hyper - parameter @xmath169 ) , and not fully exploiting the effective angular resolution of the data and image reconstruction process .    by minimizing the @xmath0-norm over the @xmath169 and @xmath15 parameter space , it is possible to implement automated image quality assessment .",
    "based on the this work , several developments are foreseen , the most obvious of which being algorithm comparison with the @xmath0-norm and proper convolution .",
    "the most ambitious is automated image reconstruction . to achieve this goal ,",
    "two aspects must be addressed : ( _ i _ ) the determination of an initial image for the reconstruction algorithm ( for phase closure only ) , and ( _ ii _ ) the determination of the final @xmath169 in the reconstruction .",
    "the second aspect is clearly the most difficult .",
    "it opens the requirements for image reconstruction algorithms to output tables of images for different levels of regularisation , allowing the end - user to determine the final values of @xmath169 .",
    "an important aspect is to identify the situations where phase referencing or phase closure are the best options for imaging .",
    "this choice is now possible with the _ gravity _ and _ pionier _ instruments .",
    "its study requires the inclusion of other ingredients not addressed in the present article , such as ( _ i _ ) compatible @xmath1-coverages , ( _ ii _ ) noise models taking into account photon and detector statistics ( e.g.,@xcite ) and/or light splitting between telescopes ( e.g.,@xcite ) , and ( _ iii _ ) a span of signal - to - noise ratios .",
