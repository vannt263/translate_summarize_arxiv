    "the origin of high - energy cosmic rays ( crs ) remains a mystery despite several attempts to unravel it over the last century .",
    "this situation is in part due to the inadequate knowledge of the nature and the spectra of energetic primary cosmic rays ( pcrs ) from their direct measurements above a few @xmath0 ev .",
    "even the presently available sophisticated technology , viz . satellites and",
    "balloon borne experiments , can not do the job because of the very low flux of the radiation . currently the only feasible way to get",
    "information about such energetic particles is through the study of cr extensive air showers ( eas ) which are cascades of many secondary particles produced when pcr particles interact with atmospheric nuclei during their advancement towards the ground .",
    "there exists a power law behavior in the energy spectrum of pcrs with three breaks .",
    "first , a knee around @xmath1 pev just after which the spectral index suddenly takes a value @xmath2 from @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , an ankle in the vicinity of the few eev energy after which the spectrum flattens again to its original slope . finally , at energies above @xmath4 ev , the pcr flux experiences a suppression [ 1 - 4 ] which is compatible with the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect [ 5 ] .",
    "however , other possible reasons ( e.g. upper limit in the energy at the source ) for the suppression can not be ruled out .",
    "present understanding takes the knee to be a signature of galactic origin of pcrs .",
    "hence , measurements of several characteristics of pcrs including its mass composition around the knee are very important for proper understanding of the origin of this spectral feature",
    ".    observables from eas experiments are known to be densities and arrival times of cascade particles .",
    "more than @xmath5 of the various charged secondaries are electrons ( sum of @xmath6 and @xmath7 henceforth termed as electrons ) .",
    "these observables are measured at different radial distances , and they contain all information on the primary particle . by applying the shower reconstruction to the electron density data using the so called nishimura - kamata - greisen ( nkg ) type lateral density function ( ldf ) , the crucial eas parameters such as shower size ( @xmath8 ) , the eas core and the shower age ( @xmath9 ) are obtained . in eas experiments equipped with hybrid detector system [ 6 - 7 ] , eas components such as muons ( @xmath10 ) , hadrons ( @xmath11 ) , air shower associated cherenkov photons , and fluorescence light are also measured simultaneously with electrons .",
    "the observed results are usually interpreted by means of detailed monte carlo simulations which cautiously account various interaction processes of primary or a few secondary particles as input .",
    "but our understanding of hadronic interactions at high energies is limited .",
    "in addition , there exists huge fluctuations in interaction mechanisms in a cascade which however are intrinsic to any eas .",
    "therefore , any conclusion derived from eas measurements remains somewhat uncertain , and even sometimes there are huge inconsistencies on conclusions drawn from the experiments .",
    "therefore , a multi - parameter approach in this context is expected to be more efficient . in this approach ,",
    "several possible eas parameters are simultaneously considered in order to extract information on shower initiating primaries in eas experiments with smaller uncertainties .    in the present work",
    ", the shower age @xmath9 , which is directly linked to the slope of the ldf ( nkg ) , and essentially describes the form or shape of the lateral distribution of eas electrons , is adjudged an important parameter in the multi - parameter approach .",
    "it provides the fundamental relation between the depth of shower maximum ( @xmath12 ) and the slope of the ldf .",
    "it also determines the stage of shower development , starting mainly from the @xmath12 to the ground as per electromagnetic ( em ) cascade theory .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath9 is related to the degree of steepness of the lateral distribution of electrons . by virtue of these features of the @xmath9 parameter",
    ", it is still being used to study the pcrs .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how the concept of shower age , introduced in the em theory , is used to describe the evolution of an eas in the longitudinal and transverse ( i.e. lateral ) directions with respect to the shower axis in the atmosphere . in section iii",
    ", the characteristics of the method of simulation used in this work will be described .",
    "the same section also includes the method of analysis of simulated data for estimation of air shower parameters .",
    "the results of the study are presented in section iv with the necessary discussion .",
    "conclusions will be drawn in section v.",
    "the concept of the shower age has been used in cr studies since around 1940 .",
    "it first appears in the early works of rossi and greisen [ 8 ] , and later in nishimura s work [ 9 ] .",
    "their works exploited the concept in formulating some expressions needed for the solutions of the diffusion equations due to longitudinal development in the em cascade theory .",
    "it was then applied to the lateral spread of electrons around the cascade axis while solving the diffusion equations in the three - dimensional em cascade theory .",
    "the most simple and earliest description of the em cascade was being started with the longitudinal development .",
    "one of the most popular analytic representations of the average longitudinal profile was provided by greisen [ 10 ] .",
    "this so called greisen profile was obtained from the calculations carried out by snyder in the so called approximation b ( taking into account only three processes , ( a ) pair production by the photons , ( b ) bremsstrahlung by the electrons and , ( c ) collision energy loss suffered by the electrons ) , is given by @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 gives the stage of the longitudinal cascade development , @xmath15 is the energy of the primary photon generating the cascade ( the atmospheric depth @xmath16 is expressed in cascade units ; it is normalized by the radiation length of electrons in air , that is equal to 37.1 g @xmath17 ) .",
    "the average evolving stage of pure em cascades is expressed primarily by the longitudinal shape or shower age @xmath14 parameter .",
    "it is essentially the inverse of the fractional rate of change of the total electron number of an eas with atmospheric depth [ 8 ] .",
    "this fractional rate of change is called the size slope @xmath18 as @xmath19 thus , the shower age is simply related to the rate of growth and decay of @xmath20 in a shower , and mathematically expressed by the operation @xmath21 .    after doing a few mathematical operations to the equation ( 2 ) ,",
    "rossi and greisen attributed a more direct physical meaning to the shower age as a shape or spectral index of the energy spectra of em particles . in a shower initiated by an electron or photon ,",
    "the energy spectra of secondary electrons or photons follow a power law of the form , @xmath22 the power law works above the critical energy @xmath23 , where @xmath23 is the energy value at which ionization and bremsstrahlung energy losses are equal , by an electron , which happens at @xmath24 mev for electrons in air .",
    "after the preliminary work of molire and bethe , focusing on the lateral electron distribution near the cascade maximum , nishimura and kamata described the lateral development under the assumption that electrons suffer constant amount ( energy independent ) of collision loss per radiation length , which is equal to the critical energy ( approximation b ) [ 11 ] by solving the 3d diffusion equations .",
    "fitting their numerical results on the electron densities , nishimura and kamata were able to propose a first @xmath25-dependence analytic expression for the shower age @xmath14 @xmath26 where @xmath16 is the atmospheric slant depth ( in electron radiation length unit ) of the observational level , @xmath27 is the energy of the primary electron / gamma ; @xmath25 and @xmath28 are the radial distance from the shower core , and the molire radius ( @xmath28 corresponds the radius of a cylindrical region where @xmath29 of the em shower energy is deposited , that is , @xmath30 m at sea level ) . with this definition , @xmath31 at the top of the atmosphere and @xmath32 at the depth of shower maximum . under the same theoretical framework ,",
    "the ldf of cascade particles advancing through a constant air medium , was expressed approximately by greisen , and is very well - known as the nishimura - kamata - greisen ( nkg ) structure function [ 10 ] , given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 essentially describes the slope of the ldf which is determined from the shape of the observed lateral distribution of electrons in an eas .",
    "the normalization factor c(@xmath34 ) in the equation ( 5 ) is given by @xmath35    an expression for the electron density ( @xmath36 ) in terms of the profile function @xmath37 ( thanks to the properties of the eulerian function as shown in appendix : section 3 ) is , @xmath38    the relation @xmath39 holds for em showers [ 11 ] .",
    "such equivalence implies the correlation between steeper lateral distributions ( @xmath40 ) or flatter lateral distributions ( @xmath41 ) in proportion to the distance to shower maximum .",
    "it suggests also the employment of the parameter @xmath34 as a hint of the global shower cascading expected to depend on shower initiating particle and several interaction features ( cross - section , multiplicity and in - elasticity ) .    however , nishimura , kamata and greisen noted some difficulties when comparing the prediction of the cascade theory with the measured lateral distributions of electrons in eas .",
    "we have listed hereunder some limitations on the validity of the analytical expressions caused by the various approximations ( so - called approximations a and b ) in obtaining the solutions as well as due to over - simplification of the adopted 3d transport equations .",
    "the validity of the equation ( 5 ) therefore obeys some conditions , which are as follows :    * @xmath42 ; due to the asymptotic value of the cross sections * @xmath43 ; more than one radiation length unit is necessary to consider the continuity in the cascade * @xmath44    the last condition may be not satisfied in the vicinity of the eas axis as underlined by nishimura considering not appropriate to use the formula near the eas core . nishimura and kamata also ascertained that corrections were necessary to their calculations performed for the homogeneous medium . in consequence , taking into account the variation of the air density , they inferred that in order to compare the theoretical curves with the experimental data , the distribution obtained at about 2 radiation length ( with approximation b ) above the measurement depth must be used .",
    "solutions of the 3d diffusion equations came from simultaneous operations such as solutions of adjoining equations , the bessel fourier transformation being applied to @xmath25 , the numerical integration on @xmath16 , and on the energy @xmath27 being performed by partial polynomial functions [ 12 - 13 ] .",
    "this method , which involves several approximate steps and numerical inverse transformations , leads undoubtedly to a limiting ( as @xmath45 ) lateral distribution of eas electrons , e.g. the nkg ldf .",
    "the meaning of _ limiting _ actually refers to the energy condition i.e. , @xmath46 or @xmath47 through the saddle point solutions in approximation a , and the negligible collision losses of electrons in approximation b , that have been used to obtain the nkg ldf .",
    "the equation ( 1 ) concerns the total number of electrons of the cascade , whereas a parallel relation for the integral energy spectrum of the electrons is also given ; in both cases cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production in their respective asymptotic form at very high energy have been exploited . in this useful synthesis",
    "the @xmath14 parameter is defined simply as @xmath48    so far the concept of the shower age is elaborated explicitly from the angle of purely em cascade theory .",
    "an extension of the concept is applied also to hadron initiated showers .",
    "it was cocconi who first pointed out that the equations ( 1 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 8) provide a complete procedure for calculating the lateral development of a pure em cascade [ 14 ] .",
    "a hadronic shower is not a pure em cascade but consists of a superposition of many pure independent em cascades that usually build the lateral distribution of electrons of the shower .",
    "hence , a resulting single cascade with a modified shape parameter will effectively describe both the longitudinal and lateral structures of electrons for the hadron initiated shower [ 11 ] .",
    "this is a possible reason why the analytical expressions in ( 1 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 8) from the em theory are only rough approximations for the description of hadron initiated showers .    in some earlier analyses of observed eas data",
    ", it was found that electron densities at large core distances were noted to be larger than nkg predicted values [ 6 - 7 ] .",
    "the muon decay process might be a possible reason for the origin of it .",
    "on the other hand , the original nk ( nishimura - kamata ) predicted electron densities near the core were found a little higher than those with the nkg in the domain @xmath49 [ 15 ] .",
    "it was also noted in monte carlo simulations that the nkg formula was quite useful for proton initiated showers and is much faster than the full simulation of the egs cascade [ 16 ] .    in eas studies a significant part of various discrepancies among theory ,",
    "simulation and experiment is of course due to the application of a pure em cascade ( nkg type ldf ) to hadronic showers .",
    "but , discrepancies might also come either from the simplistic treatment of scattering processes ( e.g. the multiple coulomb scattering and also bhaba , and moller scattering ) in nkg or neglecting of effects like photo - production , geomagnetic deflection .",
    "also hadronic interactions affect the shape of the lateral distribution of electrons to some extend",
    ".    the limitations of various instruments used in an eas experiment may also sometimes give rise to discrepancy .",
    "for example , while detecting large showers in kascade experiment ( suppose , the setup is appropriate to observe medium size showers ) , the detectors close to the eas core get saturated and should not be considered for the analysis .",
    "then , the ldf does not provide a better fit for large showers at smaller distances and for small showers at larger distances [ 17 ] .",
    "many authors therefore replace the nkg type ldf with slightly different functions [ 18 ] , or modify the ldf by changing the parameters of the exponents to account for the hadronic origin of showers in eas data . the second treatment was indeed implemented by the kascade - grande collaboration to provide a better agreement to the shape of the observed lateral distribution of electrons with the corrected nkg function [ 17 ] .    in tien shah experiment ,",
    "a steeper profile was exhibited near the core by electron density data , and it was suggested that the nkg ldf be corrected by replacing the molire radius @xmath50 with @xmath51 for a better agreement [ 19 ] .",
    "the monte carlo calculations of hillas [ 20 ] were used to improve the nkg ldf by simultaneous modifications of the exponents and the molire unit to achieve better agreement with data .",
    "it was suggested by some authors that variation in the molire unit , instead of the exponents , will lead to a better improvement for the fit behaviour of the nkg function .",
    "this was subsequently implemented to the nkg function by uchaikin and later the kascade group by replacing the molire radius with a longitudinal age dependent effective molire radius [ 12 - 13,21 ] .",
    "the uchaikin ldf has restricted applicability , it does not work well to fit individual shower owing to large fluctuations between the detector locations .",
    "this modified nkg ldf was actually implemented in the so called nkg subroutine of corsika for the analytical treatment of em component in a shower .",
    "a theoretical prediction was made by capdevielle with regard to the errors introduced by the nkg function in shape and shower size determination [ 22 ] .",
    "it was then supported by many observations ( e.g. in [ 23 ] ) , and subsequently concluded by capdevielle et al . [ 22,24 ] that the nkg function with a single age can not describe the lateral distribution of electrons .",
    "the notion of _ local age _ emerged [ 16,22 ] .",
    "attempts were made by several eas experiments [ 12 - 13,17 - 20 ] to assign important physical significance to the parameter @xmath34 , that is obtained from the fit on the observed density data of electrons , as predicted by the em cascade theory .",
    "some experiments such as grapes-3 [ 25 ] , argo - ybj [ 26 ] etc . have realized that it could be a potential observable to study the pcrs . in the cascade theory ,",
    "the parameter is supposed to relate with the stage of development of eas in the atmosphere [ 11 ] .",
    "distribution of secondary electrons either in spatial or energy space on the ground depends only on the stage of longitudinal shower development in the atmosphere or equivalently on @xmath14 .",
    "an equality between these two shower age parameters exists in the cascade theory for pure em showers .",
    "however , such equality is also maintained approximately by hadron induced showers [ 11,27 ] .",
    "recent studies indicate that the average shape of a number of distributions of electrons in showers initiated by hadrons exhibit the so called _ universality _ [ 28 - 33 ] . the fact that the _ universality _ property of air showers [ 34 - 35 ] is such a powerful tool for the analysis of eas data",
    "can also be understood from the essence of the concept of shower age . according to the _ universality _ property ,",
    "all showers follow a similar development in the vicinity of their shower maxima , where they also share the same shower age .",
    "these showers , for an equal density profile of the medium also have the same lateral spread around the cascade axis .",
    "it was also demonstrated [ 11,27 ] that for hadron initiated eas , the longitudinal and lateral profiles of the em component can be described by some average overall single cascade , assigning a suitable value to the age parameter .",
    "the so - called universality property of simulated showers has been established for eas induced by primaries at ultra - high energies in terms of the shape parameter @xmath14 [ 28 - 29,31 ] using @xmath12 . however , observed lateral density distribution of electrons is usually described in terms of @xmath34 and in most experiments the estimated lateral / transverse shower age i.e. the @xmath34 differs from the @xmath14 for eas with hadrons as primaries .",
    "it was suggested from the experimental results [ 19,36 ] that these two age parameters are connected through the ( approximate ) relation @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "some early monte carlo simulation results obtained a relation of the nature @xmath54 [ 37 ] .",
    "the @xmath14 parameter can be estimated observationally only if eas experiments are equipped with cherenkov or fluorescence detectors , whereas the @xmath34 parameter follows straightway from the ldf for electrons which is the basic measurement of any conventional eas array consisting of particle / scintillation detectors .    in this paper , a correlation between @xmath34 and the stage of the longitudinal development",
    "will be examined using simulated eas data according to the prediction from the em cascade theory .",
    "next , we investigate various characteristic features of the parameter and its relationship with some other important eas parameters using monte carlo simulations . in this context , we have to consider some observed results from two sea level experiments i.e. nbu and kascade for the purpose of comparison and interpretation .",
    "the nbu air shower array is located at north bengal university campus , india ( latitude @xmath55 n , longitude @xmath56 e , 150 m a.s.l .",
    ", area 2000 m@xmath57 ) , was being operated during 1980 - 98 [ 38 ] .",
    "the kascade experiment is located at forschungszentrum karlsruhe , germany ( latitude @xmath58 n , longitude @xmath59 e , 110 m a.s.l . , area 40000 m@xmath57 ) [ 39 ] .",
    "our main objective is to explore the significant contribution of @xmath34 in a so - called multi - parameter approach of studying eas data to derive possible conclusions on the nature of shower initiating particles around the knee region .",
    "we have used the original form of the nkg ldf to fit the density of electrons whereas in the kascade work the modified form of the nkg was used [ 17 ] . moreover , in their work , two secondary estimators were used for the measurement of energy and mass .",
    "the nature of variation of the shape parameter was studied as a function of these estimators independently . in the present work ,",
    "we show that the slope of the ldf of eas electron distribution from a detailed monte carlo simulation study indicates the stage of development of showers in terms of @xmath34 .",
    "we also investigate the fluctuations in @xmath34 arising from its frequency distributions and the correlation of the fluctuation parameter with @xmath8 for proton and iron showers .",
    "an important correlation of @xmath34 simultaneously with @xmath8 and @xmath60 ( @xmath60 takes into account the total number of muons from a defined radial bin , e.g. @xmath61 m at nbu level ) are studied in a so called multi - parameter approach .",
    "efforts are also made to explore whether the @xmath34 has any correlation with the @xmath14 parameter .",
    "it is expected that a more direct application of these parameters from the original ldf or greisen profile function to simulated or observed data will provide an opportunity to re - examine the important predictions in the em cascade theory better . for generating monte carlo shower events ,",
    "the air shower simulation program corsika ( cosmic ray simulation for kascade ) version 6.970 [ 40 ] has been used in the work .",
    "the hadronic interaction model qgsjet01.c [ 41 ] is considered for interaction processes above @xmath62 energy .",
    "the model is combined with the low energy hadronic model gheisha version 2002d [ 42 ] that works below @xmath62 .",
    "all these models are embedded in the corsika monte carlo program version 6.970 [ 40 ] .",
    "although the low energy interaction model gheisha has some shortcomings but it does not have significant effect on the secondary particle distribution except at very large core distances [ 43 ] .",
    "for the em part the egs4 [ 44 ] program package has been embedded in the monte carlo code for carrying out interactions in the em component .",
    "the high - energy hadronic model sibyll version 2.1 [ 45 ] is considered to check the potential impact , of the high - energy hadronic models on some of our important findings .    in the corsika monte carlo code , the us - standard atmospheric model",
    "[ 46 - 47 ] with planar approximation is used for the generation of eas events with zenith angles @xmath63 .",
    "we have simulated events with @xmath64 that ranges between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the eas events have been generated for proton , helium and iron nuclei as primaries in the primary energy interval of @xmath0 ev to @xmath67 ev with about @xmath68 events for each primary .",
    "the spectral index of the primary energy spectrum has been taken as @xmath3 up to the knee ( @xmath69 ev ) and as @xmath2 beyond the knee in the simulation .",
    "a mixed composition sample has also been prepared from the generated showers containing @xmath70 proton , @xmath71 helium and @xmath71 iron showers .",
    "the simulated showers have been generated at the altitude and geomagnetic fields corresponding to the north bengal university air shower array . at the ground plane",
    "the kinetic energy cut - offs are set at 50 mev and 3 mev for muons and electrons .",
    "a smaller sample of simulated events has also been generated for kascade conditions to observe the nature of variation of the @xmath34 with other observables .",
    "the kinetic energy cut - offs are set at 230 mev and 3 mev for muons and electrons for kascade [ 17 ] .",
    "the simulated densities for electrons at different radial distances from the eas core are used for shower fit , employing the nkg type ldf for obtaining @xmath34 parameter .",
    "it should be however mentioned that other eas parameters such as @xmath8 , @xmath72 , @xmath64 and @xmath73 are used directly from the generated events .",
    "only the @xmath34 parameter is obtained from the fit using simulated / observed data .",
    "the kascade data for @xmath36 are obtained from published papers corresponding to different @xmath8 bins [ 21 ] .    in order to check the effectiveness of the nkg ldf in describing the simulated density of electrons , we have applied the fit procedure to the simulated density data .",
    "the estimation of the @xmath34 parameter is performed by means of a chi - square minimization routine using gradient search technique . in this procedure",
    "the simulated electron densities in the radial interval @xmath74 m are compared with the nkg ldf .",
    "it is found that the nkg function represents the simulated data satisfactorily over the whole radial distance except at very small distances , where the simulated densities are found a little higher than that given by the nkg function .",
    "hence , the simulated densities only in the radial interval @xmath74 m are used , and fitted showers with reduced @xmath75 less than @xmath76 are only accepted for results . for primary energies around @xmath0 ev , the extension of a shower is usually spread over within @xmath77 m core distance whereas it exceeds @xmath78 m for energies around the knee . in the figure 1",

    "the sibyll model shows relatively higher uncertainty of the @xmath34 estimation and that might have originated from comparatively a smaller sample size of simulated data in this case .",
    "with the increase of @xmath64 , a shower traverses an increased thickness of atmosphere which immediately suggests that the eas with higher @xmath64 should be older in shower age than the eas of smaller @xmath64 but of same primary energy .",

    "the nature of @xmath34 versus atmospheric depth ( @xmath85 ) variation does not have any noticeable dependence on shower size in the considered shower size range .    for mixed primaries",
    "the @xmath34 parameter is found to vary relatively slowly with atmospheric depth and even noticed to remain nearly constant at some @xmath8 intervals ( see figure 2a ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that showers initiated by heavier primaries dominate in the mixed composition sample when @xmath85 values are small .",
    "but , showers initiated by lighter primaries contribute most in the mixed sample for larger values of @xmath64 in the same @xmath8 interval .",
    "similar explanation is valid also to the observed variation in the figure 2c .",
    "however , nbu data show relatively higher values for @xmath34 in comparison with mixed data .",

    "the nbu data agree with the simulation and also some early works reported nearly 4 decades ago .",
    "the frequency distributions of differences between @xmath34 and @xmath14 also establish the fact that longitudinal and lateral developments of eas are strongly correlated through their shape parameters .",
    "such distributions and their central values are found mass sensitive .",
    "\\(2 ) the @xmath34 parameter takes higher values for iron initiated showers as compared to proton showers .",
    "this means that lateral distribution of electrons for iron initiated showers is flatter ( or older ) relative to that of proton showers ( younger ) .",
    "the slope of @xmath34 versus atmospheric depth curve is , however , more or less the same for proton and iron showers .",
    "we have also noticed that for mixed primaries the slope of @xmath34 versus atmospheric depth curve is found smaller compared to pure primary initiated eas .",
    "the observation by the nbu air shower array on this aspect [ 48 ] indicates for a dominant lighter ( proton ) species up to at least around the knee energy region .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath34 parameter has been found to decrease with the increase of both @xmath8 and @xmath72 at least for simulated pure proton .",
    "but for simulated iron showers the rate of fall is quite slow , becomes uniform at last in the nbu simulation .",
    "however , the variation for experimental data shows a gradual rise instead and , in particular in the kascade data ( from proton proximity to iron ) .",
    "this clearly indicates a domination of relatively heavy primaries beyond the knee . due to certain limitations of the nbu experiment",
    ", the data do not exhibit such distinct signature but favour a mixed composition across the knee .",
    "+ many eas experiments measured the cr mass composition using the conventional approach of implementing the variation of @xmath72 against @xmath8 , which we have obtained through the 2-dimensional projection on the @xmath149 plane in each case . because of a generic feature of eas development , the total muon number on the ground varies from one species to other and that makes the @xmath72 as a possible mass sensitive parameter .",
    "but , due to limited area covered by muon detectors in an eas experiment , a truncated size of muons ( @xmath166 ) is obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no air shower model that can accurately describe @xmath72 right now ( e.g. epos gives a little higher @xmath72 compared to qgsjet and others ) .",
    "therefore , a precise mass composition study based on @xmath72 only is still not possible .",
    "a comparison among three projected 2-dimensional plots for either the kascade or nbu is in accordance with the above prediction involving muons .",
    "\\(4 ) the frequency distribution and fluctuation of the @xmath34 parameter might be useful to predict the nature of the eas primary .",

    "the integral operators @xmath173 and @xmath174 correspond respectively to the losses in electron number by bremsstrahlung and gains by pair productions , whereas @xmath175 represents the cross section for pair production ( but , @xmath176 accounts the loss of photons through pair production ) .",
    "the integral operator @xmath177 corresponds the gain in number of photons from electron bremsstrahlung .    the approximation a is better adapted to the growing phase of the cascade and to high energy photons and electrons .",

    "for instance , in the case of the approximation b they take the simple form in the so called landau approximation :            the multiple coulomb scattering governs the lateral deflections submitted by the electrons passing through the atmosphere . the small angle approximation owing a simple expression of the mean scattering angle when the electron passes through an elementary thickness",
    "@xmath185 is an important step to express the equilibrium described by the equations ( a4-a5 ) and ( a6 ) , especially ( a4-a5 ) with the landau approximation .      the differential equations ( a4 ) and ( a5 ) were solved after application of the hankel transform to r , mellin transform to @xmath27 and laplace transform to @xmath16 [ 11,15 ] .",
    "re - transformations from the solutions expressed in terms of complex functions required further approximations , the most important being the saddle point method .",

    "the age parameter @xmath9 was first derived from the solution of equations ( a1-a2 ) using the mellin transformation , @xmath9 being the variable in the complex plane .",

    "<S> analyzing simulated extensive air shower ( eas ) events generated with the monte carlo code corsika , this paper critically studies the characteristics of lateral distribution of electrons in eas around the knee energy region of the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the study takes into account the issue of lateral shower age parameter as indicator of the stage of development of showers in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation of lateral shower age parameter with other eas observables is examined , using simulated data in the context of its possible use in a _ multi - parameter _ study of eas , with a view to obtaining information about the nature of the shower initiating primaries at sea level eas experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the observed slope of the lateral density function in the 3-dimensional plot at least for the kascade data supports the idea of a transition from light to heavy mass composition around the knee . </S>"
