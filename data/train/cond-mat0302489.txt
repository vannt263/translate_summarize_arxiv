    "the transition metal perovskite oxides exhibit many interesting physical phenomena .",
    "in some of these compounds , the orbital degrees of freedom play an important role in their magnetic properties due to the strong spin - orbital coupling  @xcite .",
    "examples include the mott - hubbard type insulators @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which show very unusual magnetic properties .",
    "although the early experiments on @xmath5 and @xmath6 were reported back in the mid 1970 s  @xcite , there has been renewed interest in the past decade on these materials  @xcite .",
    "there are two magnetic phases in @xmath5 : c - type antiferromagnetic order ( ferromagnetic chains along the z - axis which stagger within the x - y plane ) at temperature @xmath7k @xmath8k , and g - type antiferromagnetic order ( staggered in all three directions ) at temperature @xmath9k  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic order in @xmath6 is always c - type .",
    "the microscopic mechanism leading to the difference between these two compounds is still under investigation , and it might be related to the fact that at room temperature the cubic crystal structure is significantly distorted in @xmath5 but almost undistorted in @xmath6 .",
    "it is generally believed that the relevant orbital degrees of freedom , the degenerate or almost degenerate @xmath10 states are crucial to the observed magnetic properties .",
    "there have also been interesting theoretical studies related to these magnetic behaviors  @xcite . in particular , khaliullin @xmath11  @xcite considered a spin - orbital hamiltonian starting with 3-fold degenerate @xmath12 orbitals , and compared the free energies between the c - type and g - type spin states in @xmath13 by including an explicit jahn - teller energy in the model .    very recently , blake @xmath11  @xcite reported neutron diffraction experiment in @xmath0 , which shows clear evidence that the orbital ordering has a sudden change from high temperature g - type to low temperature c - type at the @xmath14k magnetic phase transition , manifested by a change in the jahn - teller type of distortion .",
    "the data also show clear evidence for the orbital transition from high temperature disordered phase to the g - type ordered phase at @xmath3k .",
    "this has motivated us to study the spin - orbital ordering in @xmath0 .    in this paper , we consider a microscopic model for insulating @xmath5 , where each v - ion has two electrons with parallel spins favored by the large coulomb repulsion and the hund s coupling .",
    "the distortion in the cubic crystal structure already present at room temperature splits the degeneracy of the three @xmath12 orbitals so that the @xmath15 orbital is favored by the crystal field . in our model , we take it as always singly occupied , while the other electron occupies either the @xmath16 or the @xmath17 state .",
    "this description is consistent with the neutron diffraction experiment  @xcite .",
    "we consider the superexchange interaction of the model and derive an effective hamiltonian for @xmath5 .",
    "we then study the mean field classical solutions of the model , and examine the spin and orbital orderings .",
    "we find a g - type orbital ordering at a higher temperature followed by an additional c - type spin ordering at a lower temperature .",
    "our result is consistent with the observed orbital phase transition at @xmath3 k , and spin phase transition at @xmath7k in @xmath5 . in this scenario ,",
    "the orbital ordering at @xmath3k is of the electronic origin , and the lattice distortion at @xmath3k observed in the experiment is a consequence of the orbital ordering and the electron - lattice coupling .",
    "the superexchange interaction alone considered in our model does not explain the phase transition at @xmath14k , which may require other interactions such as the jahn - teller effect as proposed in previous articles  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we examine a multi - band hubbard model at electron density 2 electron per site , and consider the limit of large coulomb repulsion and the large hund s coupling .",
    "we then derive an effective hamiltonian based on the superexchange mechanism . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss the mean field classical solutions of the model , and examine the phase diagram for the orbital and spin orderings .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "in @xmath5 , the vanadium electron configuration is @xmath18 .",
    "the compound has a cubic crystal structure , and each @xmath19 ion is surrounded by six oxygen ions . due to the cubic crystal field , the five - fold degenerate @xmath20 orbitals",
    "are split into a higher energy doublet of @xmath21 orbitals and a lower energy triplet @xmath12 orbitals . at low temperatures and for low energy physics ,",
    "the relevant orbitals are the three - fold @xmath12 orbitals : @xmath15 , @xmath22,@xmath23 . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion between the two electrons in the @xmath20 states and the hund s coupling are much larger than the intersite electron hopping amplitudes , the system is a mott insulator with each v - ion having two localized electrons of parallel spins in two out of three degenerate @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "this scenario appears to be consistent with experiments .",
    "as indicated in the recent diffraction experiment  @xcite , the cubic crystal is distorted at room temperature . as a result ,",
    "the v - o bond distances are anisotropic .",
    "here we consider the structure at room temperature , where the v - o bond distance along @xmath24-axis ( perpendicular axis ) is the smallest(see figure 1 ) .",
    "this crystal structure further splits the @xmath25 states .",
    "the @xmath15 orbital has a lower energy , and becomes always singly occupied .",
    "the other d - electron is either in @xmath22 or @xmath23 orbital . in the diffraction experiment",
    "@xcite , the data also indicate a smaller difference in v - o bond lengths in the @xmath26 plane , which we shall neglect here for simplicity .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the atomic hamiltonian  @xcite is then given by @xmath27 , where the sum over @xmath28 runs all the v - sites , and    @xmath29    in the above hamiltonian , @xmath30 creates ( annihilates ) an electron of orbital @xmath31 and spin @xmath32 at site @xmath28 , @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 , and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 representing orbitals @xmath37 , @xmath23 , @xmath15 respectively",
    ". @xmath38 is the on - site direct interaction , and j is the exchange interaction , or the hund s coupling . for the @xmath12 orbitals , @xmath39 for @xmath40 . in the case",
    "@xmath41 , this hamiltonian leads to an atomic ground state with each @xmath42 ion having a total spin @xmath43 with two - fold degenerate orbital configurations ( @xmath44 ) and ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this last restriction in orbital configurations is valid for @xmath0 with strong lattice distortion but not for @xmath46 where the cubic structure is almost undistorted at room temperature .",
    "we next introduce the intersite hopping hamiltonian @xmath47 , given by    @xmath48    where the sum runs over all the nearest neighbor v - v pairs , and @xmath49 is the electron hopping integral between two sites @xmath50 and @xmath51 from orbital @xmath31 to orbital @xmath52 . since the most important contribution to the hopping integrals is from the path via the @xmath53 state of the o - ion between the two neighboring v - ions , the hopping integrals are diagonal in the present problem due to the cubic symmetry .",
    "namely , we have @xmath54",
    ". therefore , there are only two independent hopping parameters , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , with the super - index indicating the direction of the two sites . in the limit @xmath57 ,",
    "the system is an insulator with spin 1 on each v - ion .",
    "however , the virtual hopping introduces an effective intersite coupling of spins and the occupied orbitals . the effective hamiltonian for @xmath58",
    "can be derived by applying perturbation theory to second order in @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a ground state of @xmath62 for two v - ions @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the spin z - component , and @xmath65 is a pseudospin-1/2 operator for the orbitals : @xmath66 if @xmath22 is occupied , and @xmath67 if @xmath16 is occupied .",
    "the matrix elements between the unperturbed ground states of the two v - ions can be calculated within the second order perturbation theory , and it is given by ,    @xmath68    where the sum is over all the intermediate eigenstates @xmath69 of @xmath70 corresponding to the eigen energy @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the ground state energy of @xmath70 .",
    "two - electron states with total spin @xmath43 are given in ref .",
    "the electronic configuration of the intermediate state @xmath73 is @xmath74 on one v - ion and @xmath75 on the other . in the appendix",
    ", we list all the states for @xmath76 , and the corresponding energy difference @xmath77 . the effective hamiltonian can be derived from these matrix elements .",
    "defining for each site a spin-1 operator @xmath78 and a pseudospin-1/2 operator @xmath65 that act on the @xmath79 and @xmath80 degrees of freedom , it can then be expressed as below ,    @xmath81\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath82 gives the direction of the bond @xmath83 .",
    "the first term corresponds to spin - dependent orbital couplings while the second corresponds to orbital couplings which are spin independent .",
    "the first term also shows that the effective spin - spin couplings depend on orbital configuration .",
    "equivalently , by defining @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 can be written as    @xmath87\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are interpreted as the intersite orbital couplings for parallel spins ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) and antiparallel spins ( @xmath90 , @xmath92 ) respectively .",
    "we choose the energy unit to be @xmath93 , and denote @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 can be expressed in terms of parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and are given below .",
    "@xmath101    in the above equations , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively . for a bond in the @xmath105 direction , where the @xmath15 orbital is inert due to zero hopping amplitude and the @xmath16 and @xmath22 hopping is isotropic ,",
    "our model is similar to the original kugel - khomskii model@xcite with two differences .",
    "the first is the replacement of spin @xmath106 by spin @xmath107 the second is the effect of the @xmath15 occupation which changes the hund s coupling contribution to the on - site energies .",
    "we first discuss the intersite pseudospin couplings between two parallel spins . in this case",
    ", the psuedospin has a @xmath108 symmetry along @xmath105 -direction .",
    "along @xmath109- or @xmath110-direction , however , the virtual hopping integral for orbital @xmath111 or orbital @xmath112 vanishes , so there is no exchange term in the pseudospin , and @xmath113 is of the ising form .",
    "the pseudospin coupling between the two v - ions of antiparallel spins is quite different .",
    "there is a linear term @xmath114 along @xmath109- or @xmath110-direction , which either favors @xmath23 or @xmath22 orbital occupation to gain energy via the virtual hopping process .",
    "the pseudospin coupling along @xmath115-direction includes both the exchange term @xmath116 and the pair flip term @xmath117 . in spite of an isotropic matrix in the @xmath105-direction ,",
    "the orbital hamiltonian is not @xmath108 symmetric because of the presence of hund s coupling . in particular , the pair flip term is related to superexchange processes involving those intermediate states listed in table ii that are split in energy due to hund s coupling . to illustrate this point further",
    ", we consider a pair of v - ions along @xmath105-direction with antiparallel spins and pseudospins are @xmath118 .",
    "the relevant intermediate states in the superexchange are the states listed in the second and the fifth rows in table ii . because these states have different energies , there is non - zero amplitude for the pseudospins to flip to @xmath119 .",
    "the pseudospin pair flip process is actually quite common in orbital physics .",
    "for example , there are pair flip terms in the effective hamiltonian for spin-1/2 systems with orbital degeneracy derived by castellani et al .  @xcite .    in the limit @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , and",
    "so we have @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . the orbital coupling between the two v - ions of antiparallel spins vanishes , and the orbital coupling between the two v - ions of parallel spins remains to be pseudospin @xmath108 symmetric along @xmath105-direction and pseudospin ising symmetric along @xmath109- or @xmath110-directions . for @xmath120 ,",
    "the lack of the global pseudospin @xmath108 symmetry is due to the anisotropic hopping integrals in the system .",
    "our effective hamiltonian here is similar to the hamiltonian proposed previously by khaliullin et al .",
    "@xcite with the following differences .",
    "these authors considered a model with 3-fold @xmath12 orbital degeneracy , while we consider a 2-fold orbital degeneracy with @xmath15 orbital being always singly occupied .",
    "below we shall compare the two hamiltonians by considering the the spin- orbital coupling between two v - ions along @xmath105-direction , namely @xmath125 , with @xmath126 .",
    "this may be carried out by imposing the orbital @xmath15 being always singly occupied in the hamiltonian of khaliullin et al .",
    "we find that the @xmath127 terms are the same in the two theories .",
    "however , the hamiltonian of khaliullin et al . does not include the pseudospin flip term @xmath128 . as we illustrated above",
    ", the pseudospin flip term is non - zero . as we shall see in the next section",
    ", this pair flip term does not affect the mean field results , which depend only on the z - components of pseudopsin in the present case .",
    "it will be an interesting question to examine if the pseudospin flip term is important to the orbital fluctuations .",
    "we start with the classical solutions of @xmath86 .",
    "the hamiltonian has a global su(2)symmetry in spin space , so that we can assume the spin ordering along the z - direction .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under the simultaneous transformation of global @xmath129 ( reversing orbitals at all sites ) and a @xmath130 rotation of the lattice about the @xmath105-axis . in general , we should consider orbital ordering along an arbitrary orientation .",
    "however , for the present problem , the orbital z - component terms are always larger or equal to the x- or y - component terms in @xmath98 of eq .",
    "therefore , we can discuss the classical solutions by considering the z - component of the orbital ordering only  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the classical solutions are the same as the ising solutions in the present case . in table",
    "i , we show the energies per site in various classical states .",
    "note that @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , where the equality holds if and only if @xmath133 .",
    "we consider below the case with non - zero hund s coupling @xmath134 . in this case , the two states listed in table i with c - type antiferro - orbital ( co ) configuration have higher energies .",
    "also , we can see that the g - type antiferromagnetic spin ( gs ) and g - type antiferro - orbital ( go ) phase has a higher energy than the cs - go phase .",
    "therefore , the ground state is either ferromagnetic spin ( fs ) and go , or cs - go . in",
    "both fs - go and cs - go phases , the orbital is antiparallel in all three directions , favored by the combination of the symmetries in hopping integrals ( due to the cubic crystal symmetry ) and the hund s coupling .",
    "the asymmetry between the spin configuration along the z - axis and in the x - y plane is a result of the splitting of the @xmath15 orbital level from the other two @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "as expected , the fs - go phase is energetically more favored at a larger j where the hund s coupling dominates , and the cs - go phase is more favored at a smaller j. it may be helpful to understand these two possible ground states by examining the following limiting cases more explicitly . in the limit of large hund s coupling , @xmath135 , the terms in the energy expression in table i proportional to @xmath136 dominate . hence the fs - go phase has the lowest energy . in the limit @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , so that the cs - go phase has the lowest energy .",
    "it should be noted that although the @xmath15 orbital is always singly occupied , the virtual hopping of the @xmath15 electron means that our model is not identical to a model with one electron occupying degenerate @xmath16 and @xmath22 orbitals . in that model , for g - type orbital ordering , the ground state with non - zero hund s coupling would always be ferromagnetic .",
    "this is also true if we compare our model to a model with one electron occupying triply degenerate @xmath12 orbitals  @xcite .",
    "we have examined the linear orbital operator term in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . for the spin configurations considered in this paper , namely the c- or g - type antiferromagnets or ferromagnet , the contribution of this linear term to the energy vanishes"
