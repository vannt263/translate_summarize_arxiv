    "optical interferometers for the detection of gravitational waves need an extremely accurate control of various sources of noise . in an effort to reduce quantum - mechanical noise in such interferometers , caves proposed the squeezed state technique  @xcite : into the normally unused port of the interferometer a squeezed vacuum state is injected .",
    "details of this technique have since been analyzed in many experimental and theoretical investigations ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a central element of an interferometer is a beam splitter , and as can be easily shown , a photon state , which is a product of the states in each input port , is not a product of the photon states in each output port of the beam splitter . instead",
    ", the two output states of a beam splitter are entangled , and it was the subject of recent work by barak and ben - aryeh  @xcite to investigate the consequences of this entanglement for the photon statistics of an optical interferometer .    in particular , it was suggested that under certain conditions the gravitational wave signal may by amplified significantly without a corresponding increase in counting noise .",
    "this effect was attributed to the entanglement effects mentioned above in connection with squeezing .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate this surprising proposal in detail . to this end",
    "we determine the photon distributions in the output state of a beam splitter for weak and strong coherent states injected into one of the input ports of the beam splitter in addition to the squeezed vacuum in the other .",
    "our results are in disagreement with ref .",
    "@xcite for both weak and strong input states .",
    "in particular , we can not confirm the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gravitational wave signal may be amplified without concurrent increase of noise .    in order to handle the entanglement effects one needs to disentangle exponential operators",
    "this is rather simple in the present case , and we describe a lie algebraic method , where the disentangling coefficients are calculated numerically from a set of coupled nonlinear equations .",
    "we provide a complete graphical overview of the disentangling coefficients as a function of the squeezing factor of the injected squeezed vacuum state and the angle of the beam splitter .",
    "in section 2 we develop a general formula for the calculation of the photon number distributions in the two output ports of a beam splitter .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the special case where the beam splitter is oriented close to 90@xmath0 to an incoming strong coherent state with a squeezed vacuum entering the other port .",
    "numerical results will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "a brief summary concludes the paper .",
    "technical details are relegated to a few appendices .",
    "we consider a beam splitter and inject a coherent state into port 1 and a squeezed vacuum state into port 2 .",
    "the incoming photon state is therefore described by @xmath1 with @xmath2 the coherence parameter @xmath3 and the squeezing parameter @xmath4 are complex numbers . the photon field operators @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 fulfill the boson commutation relation @xmath7=\\delta_{i , j}$ ] .",
    "after passing the beam splitter the field is described by the rotated field operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10=\\delta_{i , j}$ ]  @xcite @xmath11 the parameter @xmath12 parameterizes the splitting ratio of the beam splitter with respect to the incoming beam in port 1 .    now expressing the @xmath13 operators in terms of the @xmath14 operators enables us to write the photon state after passing the beam splitter as follows @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the absence of the operator @xmath17 the output would be obviously characterized by squeezed coherent states in both output ports .",
    "however , these states are entangled via @xmath17 and the output state can not be factorized .",
    "this fact significantly complicates evaluation of the photon statistics of the output state .    however , it is possible to use lie algebraic disentangling techniques in order to rewrite the output state in a way which enables the determination of photon distributions . to this end",
    "we first define the additional operator @xmath18 , @xmath19 the operators @xmath20 , and @xmath18 form a closed lie algebra with the commutation relations , @xmath21= 0,\\quad   [ \\hat{s}_{12},\\hat{t}_{12}]=-2\\hat{s}_1 + 2\\hat{s}_2,\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\hat{s}_1,\\hat{s}_{12}]=\\hat{t}_{12},\\quad[\\hat{s}_2,\\hat{s}_{12}]=-\\hat{t}_{12},\\\\ & & [ \\hat{s}_1,\\hat{t}_{12}]=\\hat{s}_{12},\\quad [ \\hat{s}_2,\\hat{t}_{12}]=-\\hat{s}_{12}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence it is possible to write eq .",

    "the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are real functions of the input parameters @xmath28 and @xmath12 .",
    "a simple method for the numerical determination of these parameters is described in appendix  [ se : disentangling ] .    in order to determine the photon statistics of the output state we need to determine its number ( fock ) representation .",
    "we start out from the number representation of a squeezed coherent state  @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 @xmath31 , and @xmath32 the hermite polynomials .",
    "now applying the two exponential operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 on a product of such states yields the fock representation of the output state .",
