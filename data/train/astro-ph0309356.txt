    "since the seminal work by tinsley ( 1968 ) , evolutionary synthesis has become a powerful tool for the interpretation of integrated spectrophotometric observations of galaxies and galactic subcomponents , such as star clusters .",
    "several groups introduced their evolutionary synthesis codes , e.g. , bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) [ b&c ] , leitherer et al .",

    "the impact of uncertainties in the various model parameters ( such as in the descriptions of overshooting and mass loss , stellar spectral libraries etc . ) on the resulting colours is challenged by yi ( 2003 ) .",
    "these publications find a good general agreement among the various models , and assign acceptable uncertainties to the model results .",
    "yi ( 2003 ) points out the importance of a proper choice of filters for observing objects characterised by different age ranges .",
    "this is justified by the light being dominated by stars in different evolutionary stages at different times .",
    "the age - metallicity degeneracy is a major drawback for accurate age determinations , especially for young ages @xmath0 200 myr .    *",
    "in addition to the choice of the specific evolutionary synthesis model used another important caveat merits discussion here . *",
    "a common assumption in dealing with evolutionary synthesis is a well - populated stellar initial mass function ( * imf * ) , up to the model s upper mass limit . while this is probably a justifiable assumption for galaxy - sized systems ( although uncertainties regarding the imf _ slope _ persist )",
    ", it certainly breaks down at levels of small ( open ) star clusters and ob associations , where stars are formed purely stochastically ( by consumption of the available amount of gas ) , and these statistics dominate the observed dispersion in cluster luminosities .",
    "a great deal of progress has been achieved already on this topic , in particular by cervio and collaborators ( e.g. cervio et al .",
    "2002 , cervio & valls - gabaud 2003 ) .",
    "the main conclusion is that for systems more massive than @xmath1 the impact of the stochasticity of the imf on the results is  in general ",
    "low , and the uv continuum is least affected by stochastic dispersions .    * the studies referred to before concentrated on the models themselves . when comparing the model results with observations , in order to constrain the cluster parameters age , metallicity , internal extinction , and mass , one does not only need to take into account the model uncertainties , however .",
    "the final parameter uncertainties also depend on the observational errors , the choice of passbands used , their number , spectral coverage and individual filter properties , and the analysis algorithm applied to one s data .",
    "the most common way of model - observation comparison for astrophysical purposes is the chi - squared minimisation technique , used e.g. for parameter determination of star clusters ( e.g. maoz et al .",
    "2001 , de grijs et al . 2003a , b ) , determination of star formation histories of galaxies ( e.g. gavazzi et al . 2002 ) , and photometric redshift determination ( e.g. massarotti et al .",

    "*    * the aim of the present paper is a systematic evaluation of inherent uncertainties in the analysis of observed star cluster spectral energy distributions ( seds ) using evolutionary synthesis models .",

    "the individual uncertainties contributing to the overall photometric uncertainties are * : the observational uncertainties , an estimated model uncertainty of 0.1 mag , and an uncertainty of an additional 0.1 mag for passbands bluewards of the _ b _ band due to known calibration and model problems in the uv .",
    "the total uncertainty is the square - root of the quadratic sum of these individual errors .",

    "we emphasise that the calzetti law is valid only for starburst galaxies , while for `` normal '' galaxies ( i.e. , undisturbed and quiescent spiral and elliptical galaxies ) it is probably at least marginally incorrect ( due to the lower dust content in such galaxies ) .",
    "however , for our systematic uncertainty analysis , the specific shape of the extinction law assumed is of minor importance .",
    "we construct seds from these models by folding the spectra with a large number of filter response functions * to obtain absolute magnitudes*. the parameter resolutions are :    age : 4 myr resolution for ages from 4 myr  2.36 gyr , 20 myr resolution for ages from 2.36 gyr ",

    "clusters with unusually large `` best '' @xmath27 are rejected , since this is an indication of calibration errors , features not included in the models ( such as wolf - rayet star dominated spectra , objects younger than 4 myr , etc . ) or problems due to the limited resolution of the parameters .",

    "the systematic deviations from the input values for the combinations without the _ u _ or _ b _ bands are caused by an insufficiently accurate determination of the cluster metallicity .",

    "the metallicity determination leads to an underestimate ( presumably due to the criss - crossing of the models and/or the non - negligible impact of the age - metallicity degeneracy at these ages ) for all passband combinations , while for the oldest cluster the uncertainty in the metallicity determination encompasses almost the entire available range .",
    "in general , the median values recovered by our code agree fairly well with the input parameters , with the exceptions mentioned above .",

    "b_-band information has similar effects , especially for the youngest cluster , while for the oldest cluster the _ b _ band is vital to break the age - extinction degeneracy . only for the oldest cluster , the _ v _ band contains vital information , which is in accordance with our results in sect .",
    "[ sect.ubvrijh ] .    for optical+nir passbands ,",
    "the situation is similar : the _ u _ band ( and to a lesser degree also the _ b _ band ) is essential .",
    "generally , the offsets from the input values and the uncertainty ranges are smaller than for optical passbands only , thus proving the importance of nir data . choosing a nir band closely resembling the _ k _ band instead of",
    "h _ would give similar results , possibly restricting the values slightly better .",
    "however , we concentrated on the _ h _ band since there are more observations available in _ h _ in the _ hst _ data archive than for filters with longer central wavelengths .    * in fig .",
    "[ fig_74h ] we also see the effect of a limited wavelength coverage : in all parameters , the _ rijh _ combination gives the worst results ( see also de grijs et al .",
    "similar , but less pronounced is the effect for the _ ubvr _ combination .",
    "[ fig_misc ] compares the normal wfpc2 _ ubvr _ system with the corresponding passband combination using the wfpc2 wide filters .",
    "in addition , results based on the medium band strmgren filter system of wfpc2 are shown .",
    "in most cases the wide filter system gives slightly worse results than the standard system .",
    "however , driven by the wider filter response curves and the associated smaller observational errors thanks to the larger flux throughput , the wide system might be preferable , e.g. , for faint objects .",
    "using the wfpc2 strmgren medium - band system does not result in significant improvements compared to wide - band systems . in conjunction with the lower flux throughput ( caused by the narrower bandwidth )",
    "this system seems less preferable for our purpose .",
    "we emphasise that this only holds for our sed analysis .    in de grijs et al .",

    "data from the uv through to the nir .",
    "starting with the full set of available passbands , we studied the changes in accuracy of the recovered parameters if we repeated the analysis using only a subset of our passbands . by comparing the results from our analyses using all passbands with those from smaller subsets we found severe biases in the age distributions originating from different passband combinations , in particular for combinations biased towards longer wavelengths ( _ vijh _ ) , but also for _ uv - ubv _ ( covering shorter wavelengths only ) and _ bvijh _ , consistent with the results presented here .",
    "* from these comparisons we conclude that the passband combinations for the most reliable parameter determination must include the _ u _ band , the _ b _ band , and use the maximum available wavelength range , preferably including at least one nir band . * if only observations in 4 passbands can be obtained , the best combinations are _ ubih _ or _ ubvh _ , especially for genuinely old objects , and _ ubvi _ , if nir data can not be acquired .",
    "we emphasise once again that tracing the kink around the _ b _ /_v _ band in the seds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sed ] ) is vital . for improved metallicity determinations , and consequently for improved determinations of the other parameters as well , nir data seem to be crucial ( for young clusters the _ u _ /_b _ bands are also important , in order to determine the metallicity correctly ) .",
    "however , due to the limited metallicity resolution ( and the numerous effects the metallicity has on the synthetic magnitudes ) , the metallicity determination remains the weakest point in our cluster analysis algorithm , and presumably in any routine using synthetic magnitudes from stellar isochrones or tracks .      in this section",
    "we investigate to which extent the input parameters can be recovered as a function of their respective values and observational errors .",
    "[ fig_7err ] shows , for a range of observational uncertainties , the reliability of our recovered parameters if the standard set of filters ( _ ubvrijh _ ) is available .",
    "we caution that we still apply the model uncertainty of 0.1 mag ( and an additional uncertainty of 0.1 mag for uv passbands ) .",
    "a slight trend towards an underestimate of the ages , balanced by a slight overestimate of the internal extinction and an occasional underestimate of the metallicity , is seen .",
    "however , even for the largest observational errors of 0.3 mag that we tested for , all recovered parameters are consistent with the input parameters , within the uncertainties .    with increasing observational errors , there seems to be a trend to underestimate the ages for the oldest cluster , balanced by an increasing overestimate of the internal extinction . for genuinely old cluster systems ,",

    "apart from the oldest cluster ( which shows a slight underestimate of the age , balanced by a slight overestimate of the extinction ) the recovered values agree almost perfectly with the input values , in any case much better than without metallicity restriction ( cf .",
    "[ fig_76 ] ) .",
    "the importance of the _ u _ and _ b _ bands , and of the largest possible wavelength coverage are still reflected by the larger uncertainties for observations lacking those filters .",
    "the deviations for the oldest cluster are a result of the age - extinction degeneracy .    in fig .",

    "[ fig_76 ] . especially for the oldest cluster ,",
    "some degeneracies are removed and the recovered values agree much better with the input values than in the unrestricted case . for genuinely old cluster systems",
    "the assumption of a generic low extinction may be justified , since such systems are common in old relaxed galaxies with generally low ( and uniform ) dust content .    nevertheless , the importance of including the _ u _ and _ b _ bands is still apparent , especially in the age determination for the youngest cluster . by comparison with fig . [ fig_76z ]",
    "we can attribute this behaviour to the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "the results from the restriction of both extinction and metallicity to their input values is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_76ze ] . clearly , all median values agree perfectly with the values of the remaining input parameters .",
    "the few large uncertainty ranges indicate passband combinations that still do not allow to determine the solutions unambiguously , because important information ( passbands ) are missing .",
    "combinations without these passbands do not allow for a reasonable analysis .",
    "this includes combinations without the _ u _ or _ b _ band ( and thus insufficient tracing of the kink in the seds ) and without the _ u _ or _ h _ band ( thereby restricting the wavelength coverage ) .",
    "the _ r / i _ bands seem to be of some importance in the early evolutionary stages to trace the curvature of the seds .    restricting the parameter space of our analysis to the input values for some parameters",
    "clearly reproduces the input values of the others , and hence can be used as a sanity check for the reliability of the algorithm .",
    "we find the age - extinction degeneracy to be most important for old clusters ; for such systems a restriction in the allowed extinction range is usually possible .",
    "the age - metallicity degeneracy is responsible for some deviations for clusters younger than 200 myr .      in this section",
    "we investigate the consequences of _ a priori _ assuming fixed , but incorrect generic values for the parameters .",
    "first , we investigate the results for various input metallicities , but using solar metallicity to recover the other input parameters ( as often done in the literature in studies of interacting and/or merging galaxies ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_wrong_7z ] and [ fig_wrong_4z ] .",
    "there are significant trends in the age determination in the sense of decreasing ages with decreasing input metallicity .",
    "these trends are in some cases accompanied by decreasing extinction",
    ". if the actual input metallicity is lower than the fixed metallicity assumed for the analysis , the cluster colours will be too blue for the combined input age and extinction , and for the fixed incorrect metallicity .",
    "hence , either the recovered extinction is driven to lower values and/or the solution to younger ages than their respective input values , since both adjustments result in bluer colours for ages @xmath43 200 myr .",
    "the results for an actual super - solar input metallicity can be understood the other way around .",
    "the youngest clusters show rather randomly distributed recovered values , thereby reflecting the complex behaviour of the magnitudes at such young ages .",
    "applying solar metallicity models ( as often seen in the literature ) for clusters that intrinsically have sub - solar metallicity results in ages that are too low by up to 60 per cent , masses too low by up to 56 per cent and similarly incorrect extinction values if observations in 7 passbands are available , and even more if the observations were obtained in only 4 passbands .",
    "an equivalent test was done for our cluster sample in ngc 3310 , where we compared the results from assuming a fixed , solar metallicity to leaving it as a free parameter ( see de grijs et al .",
    "we found significantly different age distributions in either case , with the analysis in which the metallicity was left as a free parameter resulting in more realistic results in the context of what is known about the starburst in ngc 3310 in general .",
    "however , since all clusters are young in this cluster system ( with ages of a few @xmath41 myr ) , this test was limited to young ages .    in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2003b ) we concentrated on the impact of restricting the allowed metallicity range for the analysis . by assuming a generic , fixed subsolar metallicity ( confirmed by spectroscopy )",
    ", we found that the derived age distribution is fairly robust compared to the case where the metallicity is left as a free parameter , but the peak of the age distribution is significantly broadened .",
    "hence , there is a larger dispersion for individual clusters .",
    "this is presumably caused by clusters that do * not * have the generic metallicity value .    in figs .",
    "[ fig_wrong_7e ] and [ fig_wrong_4e ] we show the results for _ ubvrijh _ and _ ubih _ , respectively , if clusters with various extinction values are analysed using a fixed value of e@xmath37 . shown",
    "are the results for clusters with input values e@xmath44 , and 0.5 , but analysed assuming a fixed extinction e@xmath45 .",
    "considerable changes are observed in the resulting metallicities and ages .",
    "in many cases , the deviations from the input values are much larger than the derived uncertainties . for clusters with ages @xmath46 200 myr",
    "there are significant trends of increasing recovered ages and metallicities with increasing input extinction",
    ". if the actual input extinction is smaller than the extinction fixed for the analysis , the cluster will be too blue for the combination of input age and metallicity , and for the fixed , incorrect extinction .",
    "hence , either the recovered metallicity is driven to lower values and/or the age must be younger than the corresponding input values , since both result in bluer colours . the results for an actual input extinction higher than the fixed value can be understood the other way around .",
    "the youngest clusters show less obvious trends in the distributed recovered values with increasing input extinction , showing the complex magnitude behaviour for young ages .    * the results from this section",
    "again prove the importance of determining the physical parameters of the clusters , such as age , metallicity , and internal extinction ( and mass as a derived value ) , independently , and avoiding any generic assumptions * , which might not be justified for all clusters within a given star cluster system .",
    "this is true in particular for systems where the existence of two distinct cluster populations is already known or suspected , such as in merging galaxies and galaxies with known colour bimodality in their cluster system .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the reliability and limitations of our new algorithm to analyse observed seds of star clusters , based on broad - band imaging observations , by comparing these to a grid of model seds from our evolutionary synthesis code galev .",
    "we have computed a large grid of star cluster seds on the basis of our galev models for simple stellar populations including all relevant stellar evolutionary phases for ages @xmath47 myr .",
    "the models also include metallicity - dependent gaseous line and continuum emission shown to be an important contributor to broad - band fluxes in early evolutionary stages .",
    "our grid covers ranges in metallicity of @xmath48 [ fe / h ] @xmath49 , in extinction of 0 @xmath0 e@xmath50 1 , and ages of 4 myr @xmath0 age @xmath0 14 gyr .",
    "the models produce spectra from which we derive absolute magnitudes , and hence broad - band seds , for any given filter system . here",
    ", we present results for _ hst _ broad - band filters widely used for observations and analyses of star cluster systems in external galaxies .",
    "our parameter analysis algorithm compares a given cluster sed ( either observed or theoretical , as done in this study ) with the model seds from our input parameter grid .",
    "each parameter set is assigned a certain probability , based on an `` observation  model '' comparison using a chi  squared algorithm .",
    "the parameter set with the highest probability is adopted as the best model ; the range of parameters from sets with the highest probabilities ( up to a total probability of 68.26 per cent ) determines the @xmath51 uncertainties in the parameters .",
    "we constructed numerous artificial cluster seds , and varied each of the input parameters in turn to assess their effects on the robustness of our parameter recovery .",
    "for each clean model artificial cluster sed we calculated 10,000 additional clusters , with errors distributed around the input magnitudes in a gaussian fashion .",
    "we identified useful and less suitable passband combinations , with the aim to aid in the planning of observational campaigns .",
    "although a large number of passbands is always preferable , any realistic programme will more likely be limited to observations in the minimum number of required passbands to successfully reach its goals . * in order to successfully disentangle the three free parameters age , metallicity , and internal extinction based on the shape of a broad - band sed , and to determine the mass of a star cluster by simple scaling of the model magnitudes to the observed level , a minimum of four passbands are required . *",
    "the most / least preferable passband combinations are summarised in tables 1 and 2 as a function of the expected age of the cluster population . * in all cases , tracing the kink ( or hook ) in the seds around the _ b _ band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sed ] ) is of the highest importance .",
    "the inclusion of at least one nir passband significantly improves the results * , since nir wavelengths allow to efficiently restrict the metallicity range . for the youngest clusters ,",
    "metallicity estimates are determined by the _",
    "u _ and/or _ b _ bands .",
    "the poorest results are obtained if neither uv information nor _ b _ band data are available , or if the available wavelength coverage is very short or biased towards blue or red wavelengths ( like _ rijh _ ) .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .overview of the most important filters and most / least preferable 4-passband combinations , if nir data are available [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     by analysing artificial clusters , using a variety of input parameters ( specifically age , metallicity , and internal extinction ) with our new code , we find in general good agreement between the recovered and the input parameters .",
    "only the oldest , 10 gyr - old artificial clusters show significant signs of the well - known age - metallicity - extinction degeneracy .",
    "we have considered several _ a priori _ restrictions of the parameter space , both to the ( correct ) input values and to some commonly assumed values .",
    "we easily recover all remaining input values correctly if one of them is restricted , _ a priori _ to its correct input value ; this also provides a sanity check for the reliability of our code .",
    "we find the age - extinction degeneracy to be most important for old clusters .",
    "for such systems , an _ a priori _ restriction of the allowed extinction range is often possible and shown to be very useful .",
    "the age - metallicity degeneracy is responsible for some misinterpretations of clusters younger than 200 myr .",
    "if we , however , restrict one or more of our input parameters _ a priori _ to incorrect values ( such as using , e.g. , only solar metallicity , as often found in the literature ) , large uncertainties result in the remaining parameters .",
    "while certain restrictions might be justified in specific cases , we strongly advice caution in more complex cases , such as in interacting galaxies or in galaxies with known colour bimodality in their cluster systems .    *",
    "finally , we conclude that reliable determination of physical star cluster parameters is possible on the basis of broad - band imaging , provided the availability of a useful set of observational passbands , containing at least four filters , a sufficiently long wavelength base line , and reasonable photometric accuracy .",
    "we show that a small , but suitably chosen filter set with deep observations ( and the correspondingly small uncertainties ) gives more reliable results than a larger number of shallow exposures in inappropriate or redundant filters .",
    "*    the method we have developed is a versatile and useful tool for the interpretation of large multi - colour data sets for star clusters of different ages and in a large variety of environments , such as provided by , e.g. , our st - ecf / eso astrovirtel project `` the evolution and environmental dependence of star cluster luminosity functions '' ( pi r. de grijs ) .",
