    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) provide a poincar invariant , continuum approach to solving quantum field theories .",
    "there are many familiar examples , among them : the gap equation in superconductivity ; and the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) and covariant faddeev equation , which describe relativistic 2- and 3-body bound states .",
    "the dses are a system of coupled integral equations and a truncation is necessary to obtain a tractable problem . the simplest truncation scheme is a weak - coupling expansion , which generates every diagram in perturbation theory . hence , in the intelligent application of dses to qcd , there is always a tight constraint on the ultraviolet behaviour .",
    "that is crucial in extrapolating into the infrared , and in developing uniformly valid , efficacious , symmetry - preserving truncations .",
    "the task of development is not a purely numerical one , and neither is it always obviously systematic .",
    "for some , this last point diminishes the appeal of the approach .",
    "however , with growing community involvement and interest , the qualitatively robust results and intuitive understanding that the dses can provide is becoming clear . indeed , those familiar with the application of dses in the late-70s and early-80s might be surprised with the progress that has been made .",
    "the dses have been used extensively@xmath4@xcite in developing an understanding of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) , and their wide application@xmath4@xcite to the description of hadron properties in terms of their quark and gluon constituents is built upon that success . in understanding and unifying these phenomena , the dses point to the key role played by the necessary , momentum - dependent dressing of the elementary propagators and vertices in qcd .",
    "important in the application of dses is the gluon propagator , which at @xmath5 has the form : @xmath6 } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the vacuum polarisation that contains all the dynamical information about gluon propagation .",
    "studies of the gluon dse have been reported by many authors@xmath4@xcite with the conclusion that , if the ghost - loop is not significant , then the charge - antiscreening 3-gluon vertex dominates and , relative to the free gauge boson propagator , the dressed gluon propagator is significantly enhanced in the vicinity of @xmath8 .",
    "the enhancement persists to @xmath9-@xmath10gev@xmath11 , where a perturbative analysis becomes quantitatively reliable . in the neighbourhood of @xmath8",
    "the enhancement can be represented@xmath4@xcite as a regularisation of @xmath12 as a distribution , and this behaviour is illustrated in fig.@xmath4[gluonpic ] .",
    "a dressed - gluon propagator of this type generates dcsb and confinement _ without _ fine - tuning .",
    "( we identify confinement as the absence of a lehmann representation for coloured propagators , with the obvious analogue for other coloured n - point functions . )      at @xmath13 in a covariant gauge the dressed - quark propagator has the form @xmath14 @xmath15 is the renormalised dressed - quark self energy , which satisfies @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dressed - quark - gluon vertex , @xmath18 is the current - quark mass , @xmath19 is the renormalisation point , and @xmath20 represents mnemonically a _ translationally - invariant _ regularisation of the integral , with @xmath21 the regularisation mass - scale .",
    "using @xmath22 similar to that depicted in fig.@xmath4[gluonpic ] and current - quark masses corresponding to @xmath23 one obtains@xmath4@xcite the dressed - quark mass function depicted in fig.@xmath4[plotmpp ] .    for light quarks ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 )",
    "there are two distinct domains : perturbative and nonperturbative . in the perturbative domain",
    "the magnitude of @xmath27 is governed by the the current - quark mass . for @xmath28gev@xmath11",
    "the mass - function rises sharply .",
    "this is the nonperturbative domain where the magnitude of @xmath27 is determined by the dcsb mechanism ; i.e. , the enhancement in the dressed - gluon propagator .",
    "this emphasises that dcsb is more than just a nonzero value of the quark condensate in the chiral limit !    for a given flavour ,",
    "the ratio @xmath29 is a single , quantitative measure of the importance of the dcsb mechanism in modifying that quark s propagation characteristics . as illustrated in eq.@xmath4([mmratio ] ) , @xmath30 this ratio provides for a natural classification of quarks as either light or heavy . for light - quarks @xmath31",
    "is characteristically @xmath32-@xmath33 while for heavy - quarks it is only @xmath34-@xmath35 .",
    "the values of @xmath31 signal the existence of a characteristic dcsb mass - scale : @xmath36 . at @xmath37",
    "the propagation characteristics of a flavour with @xmath38 are altered significantly by the dcsb mechanism , while for flavours with @xmath39 it is irrelevant , and explicit chiral symmetry breaking dominates .",
    "it is apparent from eq.@xmath4([mmratio ] ) that @xmath40gev@xmath41 .",
    "this forms a basis for many simplifications in the study of heavy - meson observables.@xcite      the properties of hadrons can be understood by studying covariant bound state equations : the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for mesons and the covariant faddeev equation for baryons .",
    "the mesons have been studied most extensively and their internal structure is described by a bethe - salpeter amplitude obtained as a solution of @xmath42_{tu } & = &   \\int^\\lambda_q   \\ , [ \\chi_h(q;p)]_{sr } \\,k^{rs}_{tu}(q , k;p)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the total momentum of the bound state and observables independent of @xmath48 ; and @xmath49, ",
    ",@xmath24 represent colour- , dirac- and flavour - matrix indices .    in eq.@xmath4([genbse ] ) , @xmath50 is the renormalised , fully - amputated , quark - antiquark scattering kernel and important in the successful application of dses is that it has a systematic skeleton expansion in terms of the elementary , dressed - particle schwinger functions ; e.g. , the dressed - quark and -gluon propagators .",
    "the particular expansion depicted in fig.@xmath4[skeleton ] , with its analogue for the kernel in the quark dse , provides a means of constructing a kernel that , order - by - order in the number of vertices , ensures the preservation of vector and axial - vector ward - takahashi identities and hence goldstone s theorem .",
    "some of the many applications of dses to the calculation of hadron observables at @xmath13 are summarised in refs.@xmath4@xcite so here we make only two brief observations .",
    "using the dses one obtains a mass formula for pseudoscalar mesons that unifies the small and large current - quark mass regimes . for mesons composed of quarks with small current - quark masses",
    "the formula yields@xmath4@xcite the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation .",
    "however , when the current - quark mass of one or both of the constituents is large , the formula predicts@xmath4@xcite that the meson mass increases linearly with the current - quark mass . in model",
    "studies@xmath4@xcite the linear increase is dominant for masses as low as that of the @xmath26-quark .",
    "the approach has also been extensively employed in the study of scattering processes , and one example is the calculation@xmath4@xcite of the cross section for the diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons .",
    "this application makes the striking prediction , confirmed by recent data , that although two - orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath51-meson cross section at the photoproduction point , the @xmath52-meson cross section is equal to that of the @xmath51-meson at @xmath53gev@xmath11 , fig.@xmath4[psiep ] .",
    "the contemporary application of dses at finite temperature and chemical potential is a straightforward extension of the @xmath13 studies .",
    "the direct approach is to develop a finite-@xmath0 extension of _ anstze _ for the dressed - gluon propagator and then solve the quark dse .",
    "having the dressed - quark and -gluon propagators , the response of bound states to increases in @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be calculated . as a nonperturbative approach that allows the simultaneous study of confinement and dcsb , the dses have a significant overlap with lattice simulations : each quantity that can be estimated using lattice simulations can also be calculated using dses .",
    "that means they can be used to check the lattice simulations , and importantly , that lattice simulations can be used to constrain their model - dependent aspects .",
    "once agreement is obtained on the common domain , the dses can be used to explore phenomena presently inaccessible to lattice simulations .",
    "the renormalised dressed - quark propagator at finite-@xmath54 has the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and satisfies the dse @xmath59 where the regularised self energy is @xmath60 @xmath61\\ , , \\label{regself}\\ ] ] @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the complex scalar functions : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy : @xmath69 @xmath70 , and although not explicitly indicated they are functions only of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the dependence of these functions on their arguments has important consequences in qcd .",
    "it can provide a mechanism for quark confinement and is the reason why bulk thermodynamic quantities , such as the pressure and entropy , approach their ultrarelativistic limits slowly .",
    "one order parameter for the chiral symmetry restoration transition is the quark condensate , defined via the renormalised dressed - quark propagator : @xmath74\\,.\\ ] ] since @xmath75\\propto b(\\vec{p},\\tilde\\omega_k)$ ] , a simpler and equivalent order parameter is @xmath76 which makes it clear that the zeroth matsubara mode determines the character of the chiral phase transition .",
    "( an order parameter for confinement , valid for both light- and heavy - quarks , was introduced in ref.@xmath4@xcite .",
    "it is a single , quantitative measure of whether or not a schwinger function has a lehmann representation , and has been used@xmath4@xcite to striking effect in qed@xmath77 . )",
    "the chiral transition is completely characterised by two critical exponents : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , which can be extracted from the behaviour of the chiral and thermal susceptibilities:@xmath4@xcite @xmath80 as a function of @xmath0 the susceptibilities have a peak , which defines the pseudocritical points : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and because the correlation length is infinite at a second order transition it follows that @xmath83 hence the critical exponents can be obtained by plotting @xmath84 vs. @xmath85 , as depicted in fig.@xmath4[suscs ] .",
    "this figure makes one thing abundantly clear : very small values of the current - quark mass must be used to obtain accurate values of the critical exponents .",
    "if one retains only those values @xmath86 then an apparently good linear fit yields : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , or @xmath89 , @xmath90 , which are quite close to the values of the @xmath91 model .",
    "the small values of the current - quark mass we require to accurately estimate the critical exponents are inaccessible in contemporary lattice simulations .",
    "this is a difficult problem and the most complete study@xmath4@xcite to date employs a simple _ ansatz _ for the dressed - gluon propagator that exhibits only the infrared enhancement suggested by ref.@xmath4@xcite : @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 a mass - scale .",
    "it is an infrared - dominant model and does not represent well the behaviour of @xmath95 away from . consequently some model - dependent artefacts arise .",
    "however , there is significant merit in its simplicity and , since the artefacts are easily identified , the model remains useful as a means of elucidating many of the qualitative features of more sophisticated _",
    "anstze_.    using eq.@xmath4([mnprop ] ) and the rainbow truncation [ @xmath96 in eq.@xmath4([regself ] ) ] , the quark dse is@xmath4@xcite @xmath97 and we see that the simplicity of the _ ansatz _ allows the reduction of an integral equation to an algebraic equation .",
    "its solution exhibits many of the qualitative features of more sophisticated models .    in the chiral limit eq.@xmath4([mndse ] ) has two qualitatively distinct solutions .",
    "the nambu - goldstone solution , with @xmath98 where @xmath99 , describes a phase of the model in which : 1 ) chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , because one has a nonzero quark mass - function , @xmath100 , in the absence of a current - quark mass ; and 2 ) the dressed - quarks are confined , because the propagator described by these functions does not have a lehmann representation .",
    "the alternative wigner solution , for which @xmath101 describes a phase of the model with neither dcsb nor confinement .",
    "the relative stability of the different phases is measured by a @xmath54-dependent vacuum pressure difference : @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 defines the phase boundary , and the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration transitions are coincident . for @xmath73",
    "the transition is second order and the critical temperature is @xmath104 , which using the value of @xmath105gev obtained by fitting the @xmath106 and @xmath51 masses corresponds to @xmath107gev .",
    "this is only 12% larger than the value reported in sec.@xmath4[secmuzero ] , and the order of the transition is the same . for any @xmath108",
    "the transition is first - order .",
    "for @xmath5 the critical chemical potential is @xmath109gev , which is smaller than the result in ref.@xmath4@xcite .",
    "the discontinuity in the order parameter vanishes at @xmath73 .",
    "the quark pressure is easily calculated and is depicted in fig.@xmath4[presfig ] .",
    "confinement means that @xmath110 in the confined domain . in the deconfined domain it approaches the ultrarelativistic , free particle limit , @xmath111 , at large values of @xmath112 and @xmath1 but",
    "the approach is slow .",
    "for example , at @xmath113 , or @xmath114 , @xmath115 is only @xmath116 .",
    "this feature results from the persistence of momentum dependent modifications of the quark propagator into the deconfined domain , as evident with @xmath117 in eq.@xmath4([wsoln ] ) .",
    "the figure also highlights the `` mirroring '' of finite-@xmath0 behaviour in the @xmath1-dependence of the bulk thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the vacuum quark condensate is given by the simple expression@xmath4@xcite @xmath118 @xmath119 , @xmath120 ; @xmath121 is the largest value of @xmath122 for which @xmath123 and this also specifies @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 . at @xmath13 , @xmath127 .",
    "obvious from eq.@xmath4([qbq ] ) is that @xmath128 decreases continuously to zero with @xmath0 but _ increases _ with @xmath1 , up to a critical value of @xmath129 when it drops discontinuously to zero .",
    "this behaviour is driven by the combination @xmath130 and is exhibited by the calculated result depicted in fig.@xmath4[piobs ] .    in the chiral limit",
    "one also has the simple expression @xmath131 it too involves the combination @xmath130 and without calculation eq.@xmath4([npialg ] ) indicates that @xmath2 will _ decrease _ with @xmath0 and _ increase _ with @xmath1 , as exhibited by calculated result depicted in fig.@xmath4[piobs ] .",
    "these results confirm those obtained@xmath4@xcite with more sophisticated _ anstze _ , and in doing so provide for their algebraic elucidation : the behaviour is a consequence of the necessary momentum dependence of the dressed - quark self energy .",
    "the @xmath54-response of meson masses is determined by the ladder bse @xmath132 where @xmath133 , with the bound state mass obtained by considering @xmath134 . in this truncation",
    "the @xmath135- and @xmath51-mesons are degenerate .",
    "the calculated mass of the @xmath106- and @xmath51-mesons is depicted in fig.@xmath4[pirhomass ] .",
    "the behaviour is easily understood by again considering the chiral limit where the mass of the longitudinal component of the @xmath51-meson is @xmath136 the characteristic combination @xmath137 appears again .",
    "it is responsible for the anticorrelation between the response of @xmath138 to @xmath0 and its response to @xmath1 , and that @xmath139 rises linearly with @xmath140 for @xmath73 , just like a gauge - boson debye mass .",
    "the mass of the transverse component of the vector meson is insensitive to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in a 2-flavour , free - quark gas at @xmath5",
    "the baryon number density is @xmath141 , by which gauge nuclear matter density , @xmath142@xmath143 , corresponds to @xmath144mev@xmath145 . at this chemical potential the algebraic model yields @xmath146 where @xmath147gev for @xmath148mev .",
    "the study of ref.@xmath4@xcite indicates that a more realistic representation of the ultraviolet behaviour of the dressed - gluon propagator expands the horizontal scale in fig.@xmath4[pirhomass ] , with the critical chemical potential increased by 25% .",
    "this suggests that a better estimate is obtained by evaluating the mass at @xmath149 , which yields @xmath150 a small , quantitative modification .",
    "the difference between eqs.@xmath4([mrhoa ] ) and ( [ mrhob ] ) is a measure of the theoretical uncertainty in the estimates in each case . pursuing this suggestion further , @xmath151 , corresponds to @xmath152 , at which point @xmath153 and @xmath154 , while at the @xmath5 critical chemical potential , which corresponds to approximately @xmath155 in ref.@xmath4@xcite , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "these are the maximum possible reductions in the meson masses .",
    "this simple model preserves the momentum - dependence of gluon and quark dressing , which is an important qualitative feature of more sophisticated studies .",
    "its simplicity means that many of the consequences of that dressing can be understood algebraically .",
    "for example , it elucidates the origin of an anticorrelation , found for a range of quantities , between their response to increasing @xmath0 and that to increasing @xmath1 .",
    "that makes clear why the transition to a qgp is second order with increasing @xmath0 and first order with @xmath1 .",
    "further it provides an algebraic explanation of why the @xmath54-dependence of @xmath158 and @xmath2 must be _ opposite _ to that of @xmath138 .",
    "it is not implausible that diquark ( quark - quark ) correlations play an important role in the strong interaction . to see why , consider the class of models that can be characterised by an effective interaction of the form : @xmath159 field theories defined by such an interaction admit@xmath4@xcite a meson - diquark bosonisation that at tree - level predicts a mass for both mesons and diquarks .",
    "the procedure corresponds closely to solving the bethe - salpeter equations obtained by combining the ladder truncation of the quark - antiquark and quark - quark scattering kernels , depicted in fig.@xmath4[skeleton ] , with the rainbow truncation of the quark dse .",
    "any form of @xmath160 that is accurately able to reproduce the mass of the @xmath106 and @xmath51 mesons in this truncation will predict@xmath4@xcite the existence of stable , colour - antitriplet diquark bound states with masses : @xmath161 this points to a possibly important attraction in the quark - quark channel .",
    "however , it also presents a problem , of course , because asymptotic diquark states are not observed .",
    "the defect is in the truncation.@xmath4@xcite if one proceeds beyond the ladder - truncation in the quark - quark scattering kernel ; e.g. , including the other diagrams depicted in fig.@xmath4[skeleton ] , one uncovers a repulsive contribution from the crossed - box diagram that eliminates the pole in the quark - quark scattering matrix ; i.e. , the full kernel does not support spurious diquark bound states .",
    "( the same procedure applied to su@xmath162-qcd predicts@xmath4@xcite that the mesons and diquarks are degenerate in that theory . )",
    "it is clear therefore that analyses of diquark correlations based solely on an effective interaction of the type in eq.@xmath4([stupid ] ) can yield erroneous results , and the suggestion of diquark condensation may be amongst them .",
    "the consequences of a putative diquark condensate are easy to elucidate .",
    "it is adequate to consider a simple separable model@xmath4@xcite @xmath163 which preserves goldstone s theorem and ensures the absence of a lehmann representation for the quark propagator .",
    "ansatz _ has two parameters that can be fixed by requiring a good description of pion properties at @xmath13 ; e.g. , @xmath164 , @xmath165gev yield @xmath166mev and @xmath167 .",
    "a feature of the model is that it admits a semi - algebraic analysis and at @xmath73 , with these parameter values , it has second - order deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration transitions at @xmath168mev , while for @xmath5 these transitions are first - order at @xmath169mev neglecting the effect of a diquark condensate .",
    "a meson - diquark bosonisation yields a tree - level auxiliary - field effective action whose extremum is determined by a pair of coupled equations for the quark and diquark mass gaps , @xmath170 and @xmath171 : @xmath172\\ ! , \\\\",

    "this behaviour persists until @xmath177mev when only @xmath174 is possible .",
    "there appears to be a tricritical point in the @xmath54-plane .",
    "clearly the formation of a diquark condensate is a simple and direct consequence of assuming that attraction dominates in the quark - quark scattering matrix .",
    "however , equally clearly , the validity of that assumption requires further consideration , with a first subject being the effect of the often - ignored repulsive terms in the quark - quark scattering kernel .",
    "the dses are an efficacious tool for studying the strong interaction . in this application",
    "they expose the qualitative importance and quantitative effect of the nonperturbative dressing of propagators and vertices in qcd .",
    "the modelling involved is based on this observation , and it is necessary because of the need to make truncations .",
    "questions will always be asked about the fidelity of that modelling , and the answers will come as more is learnt about about the constraints that ward and slavnov - taylor identities in the theory can provide .",
    "that approach has already been particularly fruitful in qed,@xcite and in the development of a systematic truncation procedure for the kernel of the quark dse and meson bse.@xcite in the meantime the judicious application of dses will continue to provide a flexible , intuition - building framework for the prediction , correlation and validation of observables .",
