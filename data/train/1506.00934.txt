    "ustained low frequency oscillations are one of major concerns to power system operation . oscillations cause problems for power quality and can potentially damage power grid equipment or activate protective equipment . in most severe scenarios ,",
    "growing oscillations may lead to catastrophic blackouts @xcite .    generally speaking , there are three mechanisms of power system oscillations .",
    "firstly , the oscillation can appear due to weak damping arising from high - gain fast exciters , long transmission lines , or high transmission powers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this kind of oscillation can be quenched by appropriate power system stabilizer ( pss ) tuning , intertie line controls , and generator power reduction .",
    "second mechanism of oscillation appearance is attributed to supercritical hopf bifurcation such that a stable limit cycle is born @xcite-@xcite . unlike the weakly damped oscillation which can be analyzed by linearizing the system ,",
    "the limit cycle is an essentially nonlinear behavior which only exists in nonlinear systems .",
    "the emergence of limit cycle implies that the stability property of the system has changed , and in order to push the system back to stability , operation point may need to be reset .",
    "in addition , another mechanism of oscillation is forced oscillation , which is excited by external periodic disturbance including cyclic loads , control loops in power plants , diesel generators , etc . @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most effective countermeasure is to locate and separate the external disturbance from the system . in summary , there are different mechanisms of power system oscillations , and different countermeasures need to be adopted accordingly .",
    "hence , detecting power system oscillations and diagnosing the corresponding mechanism are of utmost importance in power system monitoring , and of great significance to ensure the secure operation of any power system .",
    "phasor measurement units ( pmus ) have been widely deployed in power grids to provide system states and dynamics in real time @xcite@xcite .",
    "the high quality pmu data provides invaluable information to enable oscillation diagnosis . regarding the weakly damped oscillation , different methods to identify oscillation modes and",
    "damping ratios are proposed including prony analysis @xcite , frequency domain decomposition analysis @xcite , subspace identification method @xcite , robust rls methods @xcite and so forth .",
    "hopf bifurcation has been studied in terms of dynamic stability .",
    "hopf bifurcation not only involves with the oscillation , but also closely relates to the voltage stability .",
    "the previous studies show that voltage collapse may arise from the existence of hopf bifurcation , which is prior to the appearance of saddle - node bifurcation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , forced oscillation has also been studied by exploring frequency domain techniques @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that if the forced oscillation is close to the natural frequencies , resonance may be observed which leads to severe consequences @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "even though each type of the oscillation has been widely investigated , little effort has been made to distinguish the three mechanisms from time series data such that the right control actions can be executed .",
    "the challenges of oscillation diagnosis include low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) especially when the amplitude of oscillation is small while load fluctuation and noise intensity are large , as well as similar characteristics of time series data .",
    "specifically , the time series data of oscillations with different mechanisms all looks alike to each other .",
    "this paper proposes a novel method to diagnose the mechanisms of sustained oscillations using pmu data . a unified mathematical framework to describe sustained oscillation",
    "is developed , under which the statistical signatures of different models are explored .",
    "it is shown that sustained oscillations of different mechanisms exhibit distinct statistical signatures including the kurtosis and the power spectral density , based on which an oscillation diagnosis method is developed .",
    "numerical examples show that the proposed diagnosis method is able to accurately identify the exact mechanism for oscillation even when the snr is low , and meanwhile provides insightful information to locate the oscillation sources , which are crucial to implement the right control actions in a timely manner .",
    "note that the goals and focus of the proposed method and conventional waveform analysis techniques are different and complementary to each other .",
    "the proposed method is to diagnose different oscillation mechanisms and locate the potential sources , whereas the conventional waveform analysis techniques focus on analyzing damping , frequency , oscillation mode shapes , etc . by nature",
    ", the traditional waveform analysis does not distinguish between different oscillation mechanisms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectionmodel ] describes a unified framework under which the mathematical model for each oscillation mechanism is developed .",
    "section [ sectionstatistical signatures ] presents the statistical signatures for each oscillation mechanism based on which an oscillation diagnosis method is proposed .",

    "the power system dynamic model can be described as : @xmath0 equation ( [ fast ode ] ) describes dynamics of generators and their associated control as well as load dynamics , and ( [ algebraic eqn ] ) describes the electrical transmission system and the internal static behaviors of passive devices . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are continuous functions ; vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the corresponding state variables ( generator rotor angles , rotor speeds , etc ) and algebraic variables ( bus voltages , bus angles , etc ) , and @xmath5 is the vector describing stochastic behaviors in real - world power systems .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , sustained oscillations of power systems can be produced by several vastly different mechanisms . in the sections below we discuss possible origins of oscillations and develop the corresponding mathematical models .",
    "weakly damped oscillation can be classified into local mode oscillations , and interarea mode oscillations .",
    "local mode oscillations are usually caused by automatic voltage regulators ( avrs ) operating at high output and feeding into weak transmission networks ; interarea mode are associated with weak transmission links and heavy power transfers .",
    "power system stabilizers ( psss ) are the most common means of enhancing the damping and suppressing the oscillations .",
    "mathematically , weak damping means that all eigenvalues of @xmath16 in ( [ compactpowersystem ] ) are still in the left half plane , whereas the principal eigenvalue which has the minimum absolute value has been very close to the imaginary axis .",
    "according to normal form analysis @xcite , the dynamics of system ( [ compactpowersystem ] ) can be decomposed into dynamics of individual modes , and we focus on the dynamics of the least stable mode described as below : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is close to zero .",

    "supercritical hopf bifurcation , which leads to the emergence of a stable limit cycle , is another mechanism of power system oscillation .",
    "unlike the weakly damped oscillation , the occurrence of hopf bifurcation indicates that the equilibrium point of system has already lost its stability .",
    "the oscillation due to hopf bifurcation can be regarded as an early warning of voltage collapse , since hopf bifurcation usually occurs before saddle node bifurcation which results in the final voltage collapse @xcite .",

    "this kind of oscillation is not a result of the general dynamics of power system , instead , it is caused by an external forcing with a distinct oscillatory behavior .",
    "particularly , forced oscillation may lead to voltage flickering when the frequency is around 10hz where the human eye is most sensitive ; forced oscillation near the natural modes may result in resonance , and small disturbance is then amplified and expanded rapidly in the whole power system .",

    "this example shows that the proposed oscillation diagnosis method is able to identify the limit cycle from all the mechanisms even when the snr is low , and thus provides significant guidance to adopt the right control strategy in time . in this example , load increasing needs to be stopped to avoid further voltage degradation or even voltage collapse .",
    "we further observed that the kurtosis of real - time data may also help locate the oscillation source or the problematic components , because the absolute value of the kurtosis indicates the amplitude of oscillation under fixed noise intensity as shown in ( [ lckurtosis ] ) . by comparing the kurtosis of the voltage magnitudes at different buses which can be achieved from pmu data ,",
    "the problematic components like the most stressed generator may be identified . in this example , the kurtosis of each voltage magnitude is shown in table [ tablekurtosislc ] . for illustration purpose , we do not consider measurement noise here .",
    "we see that the kurtosis of the voltage magnitude at bus 2 has the maximum absolute value which indicates that the amplitude of voltage oscillation is larger at bus 2 compared with other buses .",
    "the oscillation with larger amplitude implies more severe problem and potential oscillation source , which is true in this case .",
    "the activation of oxl of the generator at bus 2 results in the excitation of other fast variables of avrs , and finally leads to the voltage oscillation issue .",
    "additionally , as the power support for the load at bus 5 is mainly from the generator at bus 2 , the load at bus 5 needs to stop increasing in order to avoid further voltage degradation ; parameters of the excitation system of the generator at bus 2 also need to be tuned to suppress the oscillation .      in the last case , it is again hard to distinguish the oscillation mechanism directly from the time series data shown in fig .",

    "besides , the amplitude of the forced oscillation in the subspace of @xmath102 is @xmath103 p.u . , and variance of measurement noise is @xmath100 , hence the snr is approximately @xmath104 db , which is very low and will be even lower if the influence of load fluctuations is considered .    0.5     0.5     the actual situation is as follows , the exponential recovery load at bus 5 increases by 5% between 300s and 350s",

    "therefore , the increasing fluctuation of the bus voltage shown in fig . [ voltage - c ] is due to forced oscillation .",
    "this example shows that the proposed diagnosis method can successfully identify the forced oscillation among all the mechanisms at a low snr . as mentioned before , the mechanism diagnosis for the oscillation with small amplitude is necessary to implement mitigation control in a timely manner .",
    "similarly , the kurtosis may help locate the oscillation source .",
    "the absolute value of the kurtosis indicates the amplitude of oscillation as shown in ( [ forcedkurtosis ] ) . by comparing the kurtosis of the voltage magnitudes at different buses ,",

    "we see that the kurtosis of the voltage magnitude at bus 5 has the maximum absolute value , which indicates that the amplitude of voltage oscillation is larger at bus 5 compared with other buses .",
