    "beside the covariant description of general relativity , a hamiltonian formalism of gravity based on the existence of foliations for globally hyperbolic space - times was developed by arnowitt , deser and@xmath0misner ( hereafter adm ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "the canonical coordinates are the components of the induced metric on the 3-leaves of the foliation , while the canonical momenta are related in a simple way to the extrinsic curvature of these spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "gravitational evolution is therefore quoted as geometrodynamics . the freedom to perform",
    "coordinate transformations on the leaves of the foliation leads to the diffeomorphism ( or momentum ) constraints .",
    "the true dynamics is encompassed in the so - called hamiltonian constraint . these four constraints ( per point ) form a dirac algebra @xcite , which is not a true algebra in the mathematical sense , as its closure is obstructed by the appearance of the induced metric in the poisson brackets of the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "the problem of time in canonical gravity was reviewed by isham in ref .",
    "approaches for introducing the concept of time are of three types : time is either identified before or after quantization , or in certain approaches time plays no fundamental role at all . in what follows , we are interested in identifying time at the classical level .",
    "time is not preselected by any hamiltonian description of gravity , there are infinitely many ways to choose the time ( many - fingered time formalism ) ishamkuchar . despite this ambiguity , in certain cases",
    "it is possible to select a preferred time function , by either imposing coordinate conditions @xcite or by filling space - time with an adequate reference fluid @xcite , @xcite and letting gravity to evolve in the ( proper ) time of the chosen reference fluid .    in certain cases new canonical variables",
    "can be introduced , providing new constraints for gravity @xcite , @xcite , kouletsis . among the advantages we count that the dirac algebra transforms into a true algebra and the quantization of the hamiltonian constraint , usually leading to the wheeler - de witt equation ( which has no linear space of solutions ) ,",
    "rather gives a schrdinger equation .",
    "this program has been particularly successful for incoherent dust , as presented by brown and kucha in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a similar formalism @xcite was by bik and kucha applied for null dust , the geometrical optics approximation to non - gravitational radiation .",
    "null dust however provides no natural time function , basically because , unlike the congruence of the incoherent dust particles , null world lines have no natural parametrization . while for ordinary dust the hamiltonian- and supermomentum constraints depend on four pairs of canonical variables associated with the proper time and the comoving coordinate frame of the dust , the constraint equations for null dust contain only three pairs of comoving coordinates .",
    "the quantum theory of gravitational collapse can be modelled in the most simple spherically symmetric case by a collapsing thin shell of null dust @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "a second null dust shell can be introduced in the model in order to test the quantum behaviour of the geometry  induced by the first shell .",
    "motivated by certain problems in the above scenario , the canonical formalism in the presence of a null dust has been recently extended to the case of two cross - flowing , non - interacting null dust streams in a spherically symmetric space - time by bik and hjek @xcite .",
    "this formalism combines ingredients of the canonical formalisms developed for null dust bicakkuchar with elements of the geometrodynamics of the schwarzschild space - time @xcite , developed by kucha .",
    "the lack of  a time - standard for a single null dust however deprived the canonical formalism of the cross - streaming null dust from a time - standard as well .",
    "this is because the starting point of the canonical description bicakhajicek is simply the sum of the spherically reduced einstein - hilbert action for gravity and  two pieces of the null dust action , also reduced by spherically symmetry .",
    "the null dust variables are therefore doubled , without any of them becoming an internal time .",
    "the basic assumption of ref .",
    "bicakhajicek is that the cross - flowing null dust streams interact only gravitationally , therefore the energy - momentum tensors of the components are conserved separately .",
    "the analysis of the equations of motion provides two pairs of integrals of motion ( per point ) , one pair for each null dust component .",
    "unfortunately the hamiltonian density could not be explicitly expressed in terms of these quantities , except in the case when one of the null dust components is switched off .",
    "in this case the action can be transformed such that the matter part of the liouville form contains the integrals of motion associated to the null dust component in question .    the formalism derived in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for certain known spherically symmetric space - times , for example the vaidya space - time , describing the one - component null dust @xcite , and the _",
    "static _ space - time found in ref .",
    "@xcite by one of the present authors .",
    "the latter space - time represents the geometry in the presence of a static cross - flow of non - interacting null dust streams .",
    "although it is asymptotically non - flat and it has a central naked singularity , it can be conveniently interpreted as the radiation atmosphere of a star . a second interpretation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is of a 2-dimensional dilatonic model , in the presence of a pair of 2-dimensional scalar fields . while the dilaton is the square of the radial coordinate , the scalar fields are related to the energy densities of the null dust streams .",
    "the third interpretation , based on previous work of letelier @xcite , is of an anisotropic fluid , with radial pressure equal to its energy density and no tangential pressures .",
    "the static solution @xcite has a homogenous counterpart @xcite , which can be interpreted as a kantowski - sachs type cosmology .",
    "these two space - times obey a unicity theorem , as they are the only spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein equation in the presence of a cross - flow of null dust streams with an additional ( fourth ) killing vector @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for null dust streams with negative energy density , wormhole space - times emerge @xcite , @xcite .    the anisotropic fluid interpretation of the static space - time the cross - flow of null dust streams with positive energy densities is particularly important for our purposes .",
    "the physical model of the anisotropic fluid _ has _ a preferred time , which is the time elapsed in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "this suggests that in contrast with the single null dust model , for the two component null dust an internal time formalism can be constructed . in this paper",
    "we will explicitly construct the matter action for the static configuration of non - interacting null dust streams in terms of suitable variables , containing the internal time singled out uniquely by the cross - flow of null dust .    in sec .",
    "ii we summarize the basic ingredients necessary for the purposes of the present work .",
    "we present :    ( a ) : :    the canonical formalism of ordinary incoherent dust brownkuchar , with    special emphasize on how the proper choice of the internal time allows    us to introduce a set of new constraints for gravity , such that the    new super - hamiltonian constraint becomes _ linear _ in the canonical    momentum conjugate to the internal time ; ( b ) : :    the geometrodynamics of the spherically symmetric static vacuum    @xcite , with special emphasize on the introduction of geometrically    motivated canonical variables ( including the schwarzschild mass ) in    the gravitational sector ; ( c ) : :    the spherically symmetric , static space - time with crossflowing null    dust streams @xcite and ( d ) : :    the anisotropic fluid interpretation of the cross - flow of    non - interacting null dust streams @xcite , which provides the internal    time for the two component null dust .    in sec .",
    "iii we introduce an action functional of three scalar fields characterizing the static cross - flow of null dust minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "we show that variation with respect to the metric together with the equations of motion reproduces the energy - momentum tensor of two non - interacting radiation streams .",
    "two pairs of conservation equations for the rest mass currents and the momentum currents also emerge .    in sec .",
    "iv we derive the contribution of the two null dust streams to the super - hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "then we fulfill the program of replacing the total super - hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints by an equivalent set , in which both momenta conjugate to the temporal and radial canonical variables appear _",
