    "the measurements of the production cross section of two energetic isolated photons ( diphotons ) in high energy hadron collisions is important for testing standard model ( sm ) predictions in the domain of searches for undiscovered particles and new physics .",
    "understanding the reaction mechanisms in complicated environment formed in such collision is a challenge for perturbative quantum chromodinamics ( pqcd ) calculations .",
    "photons originating from collisions of hadrons ( `` direct '' or `` prompt '' photons ) are an ideal probe for testing these calculations because they do not interact with other final state particles , and their energies and directions can be measured with high precision in modern electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "hadronic production of isolated diphotons is not only relevant to qcd studies .",
    "the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking is currently being investigated at the lhc by searching for the higgs boson and studying its properties .",
    "recent results in the search for the sm higgs boson at the lhc indicates the observation of a new particle  @xcite , which is a neutral boson with a mass @xmath3  gev . in this spectacular new observation , as well as in previous searches and studies ,",
    "the preferred search mode involves higgs boson production via gluon fusion followed by the rare decay into a pair of photons .",
    "therefore , it is essential to count on an accurate theoretical description of the various kinematical distributions associated to the production of pairs of prompt photons with large invariant mass .",
    "an improved knowledge of the sm background will help the development of more powerful search strategies and studies for this particle .",
    "moreover , diphoton production is also an irreducible background for some new physics searches , beyond the standard model .",
    "all precedent tasks require a detailed study of the various kinematical distributions associated to the production of pairs of prompt photons with large invariant mass , and therefore their comparison with an accurate theoretical description .",
    "such accurate comparison requires detailed computations of radiative corrections , which implies finding methods and techniques to practically achieve the cancellation of infrared ( ir ) divergences that appear at intermediate steps of the calculations .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the process @xmath4 ( and the related process @xmath5 ) which at the lowest order occurs _ via _ the quark annihilation subprocess @xmath6 .",
    "the qcd corrections at the nlo in the strong coupling @xmath7 involve the quark annihilation channel and a new partonic channel , _ via _ the subprocess @xmath8 .",
    "these corrections have been computed and implemented in the fully - differential monte carlo codes ` diphox ` @xcite , ` 2gammamc ` @xcite and ` mcfm ` @xcite . a calculation that includes the effects of transverse - momentum resummation",
    "is implemented in ` resbos ` @xcite .    at the nnlo ,",
    "the @xmath9 channel starts to contribute , and the large gluon ",
    "gluon luminosity makes this channel potentially sizeable .",
    "part of the contribution from this channel , the so called _ box contribution _ , was computed long ago @xcite and its size turns out to be comparable to the lowest - order result ; for this reason , the _ box contribution _ is customarily included in all the nlo computations of diphoton production .",
    "the next - order gluonic corrections to the _ box contribution _ ( which are part of the n@xmath10lo qcd corrections to diphoton production ) were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to have a moderate quantitative effect on the result of the ` nlo+box ' calculation .",
    "the ` 2\\gammannlo ` code incorporates , for first time , the complete description for direct diphoton production at second order ( nnlo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath7 . in this sense , it is the first fully consistent inclusion of the box contribution , since we are considering all the partonic amplitudes at @xmath11 for the @xmath9 channel for the first time . at the second order in @xmath7 , we also have the first correction to the @xmath12 channel  @xcite , which is the dominant channel for this process  @xcite ( at nlo and at nnlo ) , finally we incorporate the second order corrections to the born subprocess ( @xmath13 ) , which requires the knowledge of _ double real radiation _",
    "contributions  @xcite , real - virtual corrections  @xcite to the born subprocess and the _ two - loops _ correction terms  @xcite to the lo subprocess .",
    "besides the _ direct _ photon production from the hard subprocess , photons can also arise from fragmentation subprocesses of qcd partons .",
    "the computation of fragmentation subprocesses requires ( poorly known ) non - perturbative information , in the form of parton fragmentation functions of the photon .",
    "the complete nlo single- and double - fragmentation contributions are implemented in ` diphox ` @xcite .",
    "the effect of the fragmentation contributions is sizeably reduced by the photon isolation criteria that are necessarily applied in hadron collider experiments to suppress the very large irreducible background ( _ e.g. _ , photons that are faked by jets or produced by hadron decays ) .",
    "the standard cone isolation and the ` smooth ' cone isolation proposed by frixione @xcite are two of these criteria .",
    "the standard cone isolation is easily implemented in experiments , but it only suppresses a fraction of the fragmentation contribution .",
    "the smooth cone isolation ( formally ) eliminates the entire fragmentation contribution , but its experimental implementation ( at least in its original form ) is complicated   by the finite granularity of the lhc and tevatron detectors  @xcite .",
    "however it is possible ( _ i.e. _ it has physical meaning ) to compare theoretical descriptions obtained using the smooth cone isolation criterion and data taken with the standard criterion , because always a cross section obtained using the frixione isolation criterion is always a lower bound for a cross section in which the standard criterion was implemented , if we use the same isolation parameters for both criteria .",
    "the implementation of the separate scattering amplitudes in a complete nnlo ( numerical ) calculation is severely complicated by the presence of infrared ( ir ) divergences , that occur at intermediated stages of the computation , and for this reason , it is mandatory the use of a prescription to handle an cancel them inside a monte carlo code .",
    "we consider the inclusive hard - scattering reaction @xmath14 where the collision of the two hadrons , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , produces the diphoton system @xmath17 with high invariant mass @xmath18 .",
    "the evaluation of the nnlo corrections to this process requires the knowledge of the corresponding partonic scattering amplitudes with @xmath19  partons ( at the tree level @xcite ) , @xmath20  parton ( up to the one - loop level @xcite ) and no additional parton ( up to the two - loop level @xcite ) in the final state . the implementation of the separate scattering amplitudes in a complete nnlo ( numerical ) calculation is severely complicated by the presence of infrared ( ir ) divergences that occur at intermediate stages .",
    "the @xmath0 subtraction formalism @xcite is a method that handles and cancels these unphysical ir divergences up to the nnlo .",
    "the formalism applies to generic hadron collision processes that involve hard - scattering production of a colourless high - mass system @xmath21 . within that framework  @xcite",
    ", the corresponding cross section is written as : @xmath22\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 represents the cross section for the production of the system @xmath21 plus jets at ( n)lo accuracy   was performed in ref.@xcite . ] , and @xmath24 is a ( ir subtraction ) counterterm whose explicit expression @xcite is obtained from the resummation program of the logarithmically - enhanced contributions to @xmath0 distributions . the ` coefficient ' @xmath25 , which also compensates for the subtraction of @xmath24 , corresponds to the ( n)nlo truncation of the process - dependent perturbative function @xmath26 the nlo calculation of @xmath27 requires the knowledge of @xmath28 , and the nnlo calculation also requires @xmath29 . the general structure of @xmath28 is explicitly known  @xcite ; exploiting the explicit results of @xmath29 for higgs @xcite and vector boson @xcite production , we have generalized the process - independent relation of ref .",
    "@xcite to the calculation of the nnlo coefficient @xmath29 .",
    "both sides , the experimental and the theoretical one suffer distinctive types of difficulties when they apply an isolation criterion .",
    "prompt photons can be produced according to two possible mechanisms , one of them being a fragmentation mechanism .",
    "the isolation criterion used by collider experiments is schematically as follows .",
    "a photon is said to be isolated if , in a cone of radius @xmath30 in rapidity and azimuthal angle around the photon direction , the amount of deposited hadronic transverse energy @xmath31 is smaller than some value @xmath32 chosen by the experiment : @xmath33 where @xmath32 can be either , a fixed value or a fraction of the transverse momentum of the photon ( @xmath34 , where typically @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is the so - called standard cone isolation criterion .",
    "in addition to the rejection of the background of secondary photons , this isolation cuts also affect the prompt - diphoton cross section itself , in particular by reducing the effect of fragmentation .",
    "however a tight isolation cut also has the undesirable effect of making the theoretical prediction unstable  @xcite , due to the restriction of the available phase - space for parton emission .",
    "there exist an alternative to the standard criterion : the criterion proposed by frixione in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "this criterion modifies eq .",
    "( [ standardcriterion ] ) in the following way @xmath36 with a suitable choice for the function @xmath37 .",
    "this function has to vanish smoothly when its argument goes to zero ( @xmath38 ) , and it has to verify , if one possible choice is , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is typically chosen as @xmath41 .",
    "this means that , closer to the photon , less hadronic activity is permitted inside the cone . at @xmath42 ,",
    "when the parton and the photon are exactly collinear , the energy deposited inside the cone is required to be exactly equal to zero , and the fragmentation component ( which is a purely collinear phenomenon in perturbative qcd ) vanishes completely . since no region of the phase space is forbidden , the cancellation of soft gluon effects takes place as in ordinary infrared - safe cross sections .",
    "this is the advantage of this criterion : it kills all the fragmentation component in an infrared - safe way .",
    "we can also say , comparing eqs .",
    "[ standardcriterion ] and [ frixcriterion ] , that both criteria coincides at the outer cone ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , and due to the presence of the @xmath37 function which verifies @xmath45 , the smooth cone isolation criterion is more restrictive than the standard one ; and for this reason , we expect smaller cross sections , when we use the frixione criterion than when we implement the standard one , both theoretically and experimentally , if the same parameters  ) or ( @xmath46 ) . ] are used in both criteria , @xmath47 the smooth behaviour of the @xmath37 function is the main obstacle to implement the frixione isolation criterion into the experimental situation .",
    "first , because of the finite size of the calorimeter cells used to measure the electromagnetic shower , the smooth cone criterion must be applied only beyond a minimum distance of approximately @xmath48 ( in @xmath49 plane ) .",
    "this allows a contribution from fragmentation in the innermost cone and we have to check to which extent the fragmentation component is still suppressed .",
    "in addition , the transverse energy in the experimental isolation cone is deposited in discrete cells of finite size .",
    "the continuity criterion , initially proposed by frixione has thus been replaced by a discretized version ( concerning the experimental side ) consisting of a finite number of nested cones , together with the collection of corresponding maximal values for the transverse energy allowed inside each of these cones .",
    "we have performed our fully - differential nnlo calculation  @xcite of diphoton production according to eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "the nnlo computation is encoded in a parton level monte carlo program ` 2\\gammannlo ` , in which we can implement arbitrary ir safe cuts on the final - state photons and the associated jet activity .",
    "we concentrate on the direct production of diphotons , and we rely on the smooth cone isolation criterion  @xcite .",
    "we use the mstw 2008  @xcite sets of parton distributions , with densities and @xmath50 evaluated at each corresponding order , and we consider @xmath51 massless quarks / antiquarks and gluons in the initial state .",

    "the qed coupling constant @xmath55 is fixed to @xmath56 . to present some quantitative results ,",
    "we consider diphoton production at the lhc ( @xmath57  tev ) .",
    "we apply typical kinematical cuts used by atlas and cms collaborations in their higgs boson search studies .",
    "we require the harder and the softer photon to have transverse momenta @xmath58  gev and @xmath59  gev , respectively .",
    "the rapidity of both photons is restricted to @xmath60 , and the invariant mass of the diphoton system is constrained to lie in the range @xmath61 .",
    "the isolation parameters are set to the values @xmath62 , @xmath41 and @xmath63 . performing the qcd computation ,",
    "we observe @xcite that the value of the cross section remarkably increases with the perturbative order of the calculation .",
    "this increase is mostly due to the use of _ very asymmetric _",
    "( unbalanced ) cuts on the photon transverse momenta . at the lo",

    "we note that @xmath68 is sensibly smaller than @xmath69 , and this fact indicates an improvement in the convergence of the perturbative expansion .",
    "we find that about 30% of the nnlo corrections is due to the @xmath9 channel ( the _ box contribution _ is responsible for more than half of it ) , while almost 60% still arises from the next - order corrections to the @xmath12 channel .",
    "the nnlo calculation includes the perturbative corrections from the entire phase space region ( in particular , the next - order correction to the dominant @xmath12 channel ) and the contributions from all possible partonic channels ( in particular , a fully - consistent treatment of the _ box contribution _ to the @xmath9 channel  gev . ] ) .",
    "owing to these reasons , the nnlo result can be considered a reliable estimate of direct diphoton production , although further studies ( including independent variations of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and detailed analyses of kinematical distributions ) are necessary to quantify the nnlo theoretical uncertainty . in figure",
