    "the extended nebulae , often observed around luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) , constitute a quite typical characteristic of such evolved , massive and unstable stars .",
    "a census of known lbvs reports 35 objects in our galaxy and 25 in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "hence our knowledge of lbv nebulae ( lbvne ) is still very limited due in part to the small number of known lbvs and in part to the short lifetime ( @xmath2 ) of the lbv phase .",
    "the characterization of lbvne is therefore fundamental to understand the evolution of massive stars , providing estimates of important physical properties such as their mass - loss history ( through the determination of the kinematical age of the nebula ) , the origin and morphology of lbvne , and the total mass lost during the lbv phase .",
    "some galactic lbvne have been recently studied following a multi - wavelength approach @xcite , aimed at tracing both the gas and the dust components coexisting tipically in lbvne . among the most interesting aspects highlighted in these studies , there are : the presence of multiple shells , which are evidence of different mass - loss episodes experienced by the star ( e.g. g79.29 + 0.46 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the distribution of the gas and the dust , sometimes differently shaped ( iras 18576 + 034 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the chemistry in the nebula , sometimes rich of complex molecules , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( e.g. hd 168625 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , evidence that dust can survive despite the hostile environment due to the uv radiation from the star .",
    "the main mechanisms which are believed to lead to the formation of such nebulae are the moderate ( @xmath3 ) mass - loss associated to steady stellar winds and , especially , the extreme mass - loss rates ( @xmath4 ) experienced by the star during giant eruptions , which characterize its post main sequence evolution . @xcite and later have suggested that eruptive episodes , which must form the bulk of a lbvn , are metallicity independent . if this is true , lbvs may have had a role in the evolution of the early universe , when massive stars would have been more numerous than the present epoch , and may have provided processed material and dust for future generations of stars .",
    "a way to explore this possibility is to study the lbv phenomenon in environments different from the galactic one , i.e. in galaxies with different metallicity . considering the capabilities of the instruments up to now available",
    ", we have started a study of lbvne in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is the nearest galaxy ( with an accepted distance of @xmath5 ) and with half its solar metallicity ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "evidence of extended nebulae around lbvs and candidates lbv ( lbvc ) in the lmc has previously reported . @xcite and",
    "@xcite performed high resolution observations of 9 lbvs and lbvc in the lmc with the h@xmath7 filter using the _ wide field planetary camera 2 _ ( wfpc2 ) and eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) .",
    "in particular , they found that 5 of these objects show a very well defined shell in h@xmath1 , with sizes in the range of @xmath8 , indicating the presence of a nebula around them .",
    "based on these studies we have selected a group of lvbne that could be detected at radio wavelengths ( which allow us to probe the properties of the ionized gas ) through the estimation of the radio free - free emission from the observed hydrogen h@xmath7 recombination line .",
    "here we present the first radio observations of a small subsample of these lbvne , namely : lbvcs s61 and s119 , plus lbvs r127 and r143 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after an explanation of the observation and data reduction strategies ( @xmath92 ) , we compare the radio free - free continuum emission with that of h@xmath7 from the morphological and photometric points of view ( @xmath93 and 4 ) . in @xmath94",
    "we also estimate some physical parameters related to the nebulae and in @xmath95 we present our final remarks .",
    "radio continuum observations were carried out on april 18 and 20 , 2011 , at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , using the interferometer in the 6km - configuration .",
    "data were acquired with the new backend system cabb , with the maximum bandwidth of 2-ghz , in the 3 + 6 cm band .",
    "the observations consisted of 15-min scans on the target , preceded and followed by 2-min scans on the phase calibrator ( 0530 - 727 ) , for a total of @xmath1010 hrs on - source integration time . in order to achieve the best u - v coverage ,",
    "the scans were distributed over 12 values of hour angles .",
    "we used 1934 - 638 for the bandpass and flux calibration .",

    "+      from the radio free - free emission measurement we can estimate the total ionized mass as the total particles present in the nebula . for a not self - absorbed free - free emission ,",
    "the electron density in a nebula can be determined through the relation between the emission measure @xmath12 } \\label{equ : em}\\ ] ] and the optical depth @xmath13 @xmath14}}{5}\\right)^{-2.1}em\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is evaluated for each pixel from the observed brightness @xmath15 which , in the optical thin case is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a black body with an assumed temperature t equal to the gas temperature @xmath18 ( see table [ tab : literature ] ) .    from the mean @xmath19 , measured in the map , inverting equation [ equ : em ] , it is possible to estimate a mean value for the particle density @xmath20 .",
    "assuming that the nebulae are uniform , the emission measure is simply @xmath21 , where the geometrical depth @xmath22 needs a strong hypothesis on the nebular geometries .",
    "it has been believed that lbvne are often torus - like shaped , indicating that mass - loss happens in a preferred direction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if it is true , the nebulae associated to r127 , s61 and s119 may be torus seen pole - on , and that one of r143 seen roughly edge - on .",
    "hence we assume a depth equal to the transversal size measured on the maps , chosen where the emission is the @xmath23 of the peak flux density ( as shown with white lines in fig .",
    "[ landfig ] ) . in the cases of r127 and r143 we calculated the electron density and the ionized mass assuming two different geometrical depths ( 1.2 `` and 2.5 '' for r127 , 1 `` and 3 '' for r143 ) .",
    "finally the total ionized mass is given by the total particles in the nebula , i.e. by @xmath24 .",
    "the volume assumed for each nebula is given by the area where we have estimated the @xmath19 and the assumed geometrical depths .",
    "the resulting masses are reported in table [ tab : mass ] , together with the other physical parameters .",
    "the linear sizes in the table are obtained assuming for the nebulae the distance of the lmc ( @xmath25 ) .    from our estimation",
    ", the masses range between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are typical values for nebular masses of the galactic lbvs ( in general few solar masses , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the improved sensitivity at atca with the new cabb correlator has allowed us to obtain the first radio detections of the nebula around four lbv type stars in the large magellanic cloud . even if our highest resolution can not distinguish angular scales smaller than 1.5 \" ( that means structures of linear sizes @xmath100.35 pc at a distance of 48.5 kpc ) , it was possible to measure the nebular sizes and to compare the radio morphology with the optical one .",
    "the linear sizes are consistent with previous estimates at different wavelengths ( h@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as with the galactic examples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "no evident differences are visible , as expected if the @xmath28 is not intrinsically extincted . on the contrary",
    ", the radio resembles the optical .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite , studying four galactic lbvne and comparing the radio images with the h@xmath1 ones .",
    "the strict similarity was particularly evident in ag car .",
    "the radio flux densities were compared here with the extrapolated fluxes from the recombination hydrogen line .",
    "the hst h@xmath1-equivalent filter f656n has a bandwidth @xmath29 , with the h@xmath1 line in the band center , and does not cover h@xmath1 velocity features higher in magnitude than @xmath30 .",
    "however high - resolution echelle spectra in @xcite showed that high velocity outflows are not present in such nebulae . on the other hand ,",
    "the filter can detect signal from [ nii ] 6548  emission . assuming a mean value for the [ nii]6584  / h@xmath1 ( 0.6 , * ? ? ? * ) and that this is valid also for the [ nii ] 6548 line , and considering that the filter response at 6548  is about the 25% of the maximum , then the h@xmath1 emission evaluated here may be overestimated of the 15% . and this has to be considered an upper limit .",
    "such contamination of h@xmath1 due to [ nii ] is , however , within the flux errors , for most of our sources .",
    "if we assume that all the flux falling in the filter is due to h@xmath1 , the comparison between the radio and optical fluxes does not show any differences and this lead us to suppose that there is not intrinsic extinction , especially in the case of r127 and s119 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there were some extinction , this will be attributable to uniformly distributed dust , as the radio morphology resembles the optical one and we may exclude any clumping in the dust distribution .    a similar discussion must be done with caution in the case of s61 , whose optical emission could be affected by intrinsic extinction due to dust , and in the case of r143 , which is probably affected by the emission of the close hii region , as well as of a likely dusty environment .",
    "the derived spectral indeces indicate a possible contribution from a central object that must be considered and , more specifically , that current mass loss from the central star is ongoing .",
    "in addition , values for the ionized mass have been obtained in this work .",
    "estimates for the nebular mass of s119 and r127 have been previously reported .",
    "in particular nota et al .",
    "1994 and @xcite provided a mass of @xmath31 for the nebula of s119 and of @xmath32 for r127 .",
    "these results were obtained integrating h@xmath1 emission luminosity and adopting values for the electron density of the order @xmath33 , derived by [ sii 6716/6731 ]  line ratio , and a temperature of 7500 k. a further value for the mass of r127 was found by @xcite through a photoionization modeling of the emission line spectrum in the range @xmath34  .",
    "they found a mass of @xmath35 .",
    "we are conscious that the ionized mass estimated with this method is very sensible to the assumed geometry and that we are not taking into account the filling factor correction .",
    "if these circumstellar nebulae are not homogeneous as we assumed , the true average density , and hence the nebular masses , are smaller than the estimates provided here by the value of the filling factor ( tipically between @xmath36 for extended nebulae , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both these facts may lead to the discrepancy with the measurements reported in ( table 9 , * ? ? ?",
    "the contribution from the stellar wind to the total emission can be neglected .",
    "infact assuming a mass - loss rate of @xmath37 and a stellar wind velocity of @xmath38 , which are typical values for galactic lbvs , the flux density due to the stellar wind will be of the order of 0.03 mjy at 9 ghz @xcite , i.e. only the @xmath39 of the observed flux density .",
    "this means that the overestimation of the mean electron density and of the ionized mass are negligible . in the case of r143 an overestimation",
    "could be assigned to the close hii region emission .",
    "the values reported here must , then , considered only as indicative , but are almost consistent with the values in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thanks to its properties , radio emission can be used as a good probe of the ionized gas emission from a nebula around a hot star .",
    "this is important when one wants to determine the gas content to establish the total mass budget ejected during the lbv phase and to constrain stellar evolution models of very massive stars .",
    "for the moment , the resolution achieved at atca in this work does nt allow us to separate the nebular and stellar contributions to the total emission .",
    "in addition to these , new higher resolution observations can provide a more detailed morphological study of the nebula , as well as a possibly detection of the central stellar wind and hence the current mass loss rate , where instead the optical h@xmath1 estimates can be uncertain .",
    "the australia telescope compact array is part of the australia telescope national facility which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "it is also based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , and obtained from the hubble legacy archive , which is a collaboration between the space telescope science institute ( stsci / nasa ) , the space telescope european coordinating facility ( st - ecf / esa ) and the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc / nrc / csa ) ."
