    "topological insulators ( ti ) are materials with insulating bulks and conducting surfaces . these materials typically are gapped band insulators , where strong spin - orbit coupling has inverted the usual energetic ordering of the bands . near an interface with the vacuum",
    "the bands revert to their usual order , inducing two - dimensional metallic states on their surfaces @xcite .",
    "these surface states have a conical dispersion , and are described by a two dimensional massless dirac equation centered at a time reversal invariant point in momentum space .",
    "the metallic character of these states is protected by time - reversal symmetry , so that a gap can only be opened by perturbations which break this symmetry , e.g. magnetic or exchange fields .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy has confirmed the existence of these surface states in certain materials @xcite .    a magnetic field @xmath0 applied perpendicular to the surface of the topological insulator quantizes the orbital motion of the electrons and reorganizes the energy spectrum into landau levels with energies @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2",
    ", @xmath3 is the speed of the carriers at the dirac points in the absence of the field , @xmath4 is the magnetic length , and @xmath5 .",
    "if the fermi energy of the system passes through the dirac point for @xmath6 , the corresponding fermi energy for @xmath7 is pinned in the @xmath8 landau level , such that half the states in that level are occupied @xcite .",
    "particle - hole symmetry suggests that the hall conductivity vanishes in this situation .",
    "if the fermi level is raised from this zero point , as it passes between the @xmath9 and the @xmath10-@xmath11 landau levels the hall conductivity from a single surface dirac point is then quantized to @xmath12 in general , the integer quantized hall effect is associated with current - carrying chiral edge modes .",
    "each mode contributes @xmath13 to the hall conductivity when the fermi energy passes through it , so one expects only @xmath14 quantization is possible , in contrast to the bulk result suggested by eq .",
    "[ half - integer ] .",
    "the resolution of this discrepancy is that in actual samples , whatever the geometry may be , different surfaces are always connected , and may share edge modes @xcite .",
    "contacts used to measure the hall conductance will thus inevitably probe dirac cones on more than one surface , so that the observed @xmath15 is always quantized in integer units of @xmath16 .",
    "a hall effect may occur in a system whenever there is time reversal symmetry - breaking , so that it may be induced in principle without an external applied magnetic field .",
    "doping the system with magnetic impurities , or placing a surface in proximity to a ferromagnetic insulator which can exchange - couple to the ti surface , offer two non - standard methods to induce @xmath17 .",

    "we show that these simplified surface states give a good accounting of their dispersion within the bulk gap , and develop matching conditions for surfaces of different orientations .",
    "we then apply the formalism first to the problem of a quantum wire with rectangular cross - section , examining the effect of different exchange fields on opposite surfaces . in particular ,",
    "we find for equal exchange fields that the quantum wire supports gapless chiral states , but when oriented oppositely these states vanish and there is a gap in the spectrum .    in a second application , we consider the quantum hall problem for a rectangular slab geometry , with field oriented perpendicular to one pair of surfaces .",
    "we show that the bulk landau levels couple surface states on sides parallel to the magnetic field , arriving at results very similar to those of ref . .",
    "we then analyze the effect of phase - breaking processes by contacting the system to equilibrating voltage probes , and argue that in this circumstance the system should support a quantized hall effect .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , in many situations one can not understand the transport properties of a ti based on individual surfaces in isolation ; it is necessary to understand how these surfaces connect . towards this end , in this section we develop a simple approach to matching wavefunctions on a line junction separating two perpendicular surfaces , labeled @xmath97 and @xmath98 , of a three - dimensional ti .",
    "we assume the fermi energy is in a bulk gap and focus on how these matching conditions impact the surface state spectra and associated conduction properties .",
    "our method uses a general approach @xcite , in which wavefunctions of a system are matched along some chosen surface that divides the system into disparate pieces , each having different transverse modes into which it is natural to decompose wavefunctions . in principle",
    "the matching can be carried out precisely by considering overlaps along the chosen surface of all the transverse modes . in practice",
    "it is usually necessary to truncate the number of modes kept , allowing one to obtain approximate results for wavefunctions in some energy interval .",
    "this general approach has been quite successful for treating semiconductor nanostructures @xcite , and recently has been useful for understanding transport through graphene nanostructures @xcite .    in the present context",
    "we are interested in understanding spectra and transport when there are only a small number of modes crossing the fermi energy , with wavefunctions confined to the surfaces , while all other transverse modes ( associated with the bulk ) represent states well above or below the fermi energy .",
    "these latter states are incorporated as evanescent states which do not directly contribute to the current in the system , although they quantitatively affect the scattering among conducting modes .",
    "the simplest approximation in this situation is to ignore the evanescent modes entirely , leading to an `` open mode approximation '' @xcite .",
    "however , this does not define the approximation scheme uniquely , as one may choose the matching surface to obtain the best results .",
    "below we demonstrate that demanding that the truncated hamiltonian be hermitian effectively singles out a specific set of matching conditions within the open mode approximation .      to motivate our matching conditions , it is useful to consider two slabs of the ti system , with surface normals perpendicular to one another , joined through a perpendicular junction .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the corner of such a junction , emphasizing the role of the surface states , which are most important when the fermi energy is in the bulk gap . for concreteness",
    "we assume one of these has horizontal surfaces , perpendicular to @xmath81 , and the other vertical surfaces perpendicular to @xmath99 . assuming that the system is uniform along the @xmath100 direction so that @xmath62 is a good quantum number , states of the first slab can be written in the form @xmath101 , and for the second slab @xmath102 . in these expressions",
    "@xmath103 are transverse wavefunctions for the slabs , among which are the surface states discussed in the last section @xcite and for this problem are four component vectors ; the wavevectors @xmath104 are determined by the energy of the state , and in most cases are actually complex ( i.e. , represent evanescent states ) if the fermi energy is in the bulk band gap , and the coefficients @xmath105 are weights which must be related by appropriate matching conditions .",
    "this last requirement in principle can be implemented by matching all components of the wavefunctions on some surface along which the two slabs are joined together . in principle",
    "one may choose any convenient surface , and parameterize it as @xmath106 , with @xmath107 .",
    "for a given set of coefficients on one side of the junction , say @xmath108 , the coefficients on the other side can in principle be found @xcite by a matrix multiplication , @xmath109 with @xmath110 here @xmath111 is the differential arc length along the joining surface , and @xmath112 is the dot product of the four component vectors .    in general",
    ", the challenge in carrying out this matching is that the full matrix @xmath113 is difficult to compute .",
    "moreover , typically most of the transverse modes are `` closed '' ",
    "i.e. , they host evanescent states  and do not contribute directly to current across the junction . in the `` open mode '' approximation one",
    "simply ignores the closed modes and retains only those that are current - carrying at the fermi energy . in the present context this is particularly simplifying since",
    "only the surface modes are open when the fermi energy is in the bulk gap .    in the present case it is then natural to retain only the @xmath114 and @xmath115 modes detailed in the last section .",
    "if one further assumes that the penetration depths of the surface states ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 in the appendix ) are short , such that the phase factor @xmath118 has a negligible variation on the joining surface in the region where @xmath119 is significantly different than zero , the resulting connection between coefficients takes the simple form @xmath120 where we have written the two open channel coefficients for each surface @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",

    "we thus will ultimately choose this constant  implicitly , by choosing the joining surface  to obtain the best approximation , which we will argue below leaves the projected hamiltonian hermitian ; this choice uniquely fixes the value of the constant . before turning to this , we summarize the results of the open mode approximation for other possible 90@xmath130 corner junctions with surfaces normal to principal axes of the structure . in general , we write @xmath131 with @xmath132 , and @xmath133     and @xmath98 of a three - dimensional ti .",

    "in order to obtain sensible results within the approximation scheme , the projected hamitonian of the full system should be hermitian .",
    "this guarantees among other things that current will be conserved across the junctions .",
    "we now show that this requirement uniquely fixes the coefficients @xmath137 .    as a concrete example we return to the geometry illustrated in fig .",
    "the system is invariant along the @xmath138 direction , so that we can consider the system for each @xmath62 as one - dimensional , with a single coordinate along the surface , running perpendicular to the line junction .",
    "the corner can be `` flattened '' by taking @xmath139 to represent the @xmath21 surface , and @xmath140 to represent the @xmath141 surface , which we refer to respectively as the 1 and 2 surfaces in what follows . in this notation ,",
    "the portion of the low energy hamiltonian which represents the problem has the form @xmath142 @xmath143 is piecewise constant but jumps at @xmath144 .",
    "potentially this leads to problems because matrix elements between arbitrary two - component wavefunctions @xmath145 and @xmath146 may not obey @xmath147 due to a surface term at @xmath144 from integration by parts .",
    "in particular @xcite , the hamiltonian is only hermitian if @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 . from eq .",
    "[ mxz ] , this means @xmath151 from which we read off @xmath152 taking the hermitian conjugate of this yields @xmath153 and since @xmath154 , we arrive at the relation @xmath155 from the form of eq .",

    "the system does not exhibit a quantized hall effect .",
    "the absence of a quantized hall effect in these circumstances can be understood as due to the fact that when current is injected into the system from an ideal lead , since only channels with current directed away from the lead can absorb this current , the distribution of currents among the channels is out of equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that the system will support a quantized hall effect if there are current - conserving mechanisms by which this distribution can relax .",
    "generically this will be the case in real systems .    as a simple model , we consider a geometry as illustrated in fig . [ edge_curr ] , which uses phase - breaking voltage probes to equilibrate the populations at the edges @xcite .",
    "the voltage probes absorb current from each channel with probability @xmath241 , taken to be the same for all the channels .",

    "these boundary conditions are met at current - injecting contacts ( not shown in the figure , on lateral surfaces perpendicular to the one illustrated ) , and determine how the net current down the hall bar divides between the top and bottom lateral surfaces .    because the transfer matrix @xmath252 is independent of @xmath179",

    "as expected , the current relaxes into an equilibrium distribution in which the current carried by each channel at an edge is equal .    that the system exhibits a quantized hall effect",
    "can easily be seen from this last result .",
    "for any two voltage contacts @xmath263 which are both far from the current contacts , the transient part of the current distribution is negligibly small @xcite , so that @xmath264 .",
    "it follows that the chemical potentials in these voltage probes must be the same , so that the measured longitudinal resistance will vanish . to find the hall resistance , we define @xmath265 as the difference in current carried by each channel on the top ( bottom ) edge due to currents injected / removed by the contacts far to the right and left of the system .",
    "on the top edge , the resulting extra current into a voltage contact is then @xmath266 .",

    "in this article we have studied a simplified model of surface states in topological insulators .",
    "the model allowed us to develop straightforward matching conditions for states on different surfaces , opening the possibility to understand the surface spectra of a variety of mesoscopic systems .",
    "two systems were analyzed in this formalism in detail : a quantum wire of rectangular cross - section , and a slab geometry in the quantum hall regime .",
    "for the rectangular wire , one finds transverse states with a quantization condition that reflects the helicity of the wavefunctions : an effective two component spinor follows a circular trajectory as one moves around a closed path around the wire , inducing a phase that prevents gapless modes from appearing in the spectrum .",
    "the resulting gap vanishes only as the wire cross - sectional area becomes very large .",
    "the application of exchange fields on two of the surfaces changes the topological character of the surface states by inducing a non - vanishing chern number .",
    "this results in chiral states on lateral surfaces which are gapless .",
    "in contrast , if the exchange fields on the two surfaces are directed antiparallel , the chern number vanishes , and chiral states are absent from the spectrum .",
    "we also considered the surface spectrum of a slab in a magnetic field .",
    "landau level states appear on the surfaces perpendicular to the field , which are continuously connected to zero field states on the lateral surfaces @xcite .",
    "the lateral states have unequal numbers of channels propagating in opposite directions along the slab , in direct analogy with what expects of edge states in the quantized hall effect .",
    "the large number of counterpropagating edge channels spoils the quantum hall effect in this system in the ballistic regime .",
    "this is due to the existence of unequilibrated populations of the channels on a surface due to the injection of current in the system .",
    "we found that processes which restore the populations of the edge modes into local equilibrium , as modeled by floating voltage contacts along the edge , will lead to a quantum hall effect in the system if voltage measurements are made sufficiently far from the current contacts .",
