    "the negative ion time projection chamber ( nitpc ) achieves high spatial resolution by transporting charge in the form of negative ions , rather than electrons , thereby reducing diffusion to the thermal limit in both the transverse and longitudinal drift directions@xcite .",
    "this provides the highest 3-d space - point resolution attainable for long drift distances , particularly where operation at low pressures is required to make very low energy tracks long enough to measure ( for example , dark matter wimp recoil atoms ) .  in relatively low rate environments , the nitpc also has the advantage that the ion drift velocities are about two orders - of - magnitude less than those of electrons .",
    "this allows the use of low - bandwidth electronics that results in lower noise and power consumption .",
    "the key to reducing diffusion to the thermodynamic lower limit ( equation 1 below ) is to prevent net energy transfer from the drift field to the drifting primary ionization@xcite .",
    "such `` heating '' of the drifting charge occurs when electrons are drifted at reduced fields e / p > @xmath210 - 50 v / m@xmath3torr .",
    "heating is reflected in an increase of the parameter @xmath4 in equation 1 to values higher than @xmath5 t , resulting in increased diffusion .  for electron drift , gas additives with large integrated cross sections for inelastic scattering of electrons , such as hydrocarbons and co@xmath1 ,",
    "provide channels for dissipation and are known @xcite to prevent heating of drifting electrons up to moderate values of the reduced field ( @xmath250 v / m@xmath3torr ) .",
    "in contrast , ions drifting in even a high field are very efficiently thermally coupled to the room - temperature gas , since the ion mass is comparable to that of the gas molecules .  then , even elastic scattering produces substantial energy transfer from the drifting ion to the bulk gas .",
    "ion diffusion has been measured in a number of cs@xmath1 mixtures suitable for tpc operation@xcite and was found to follow the  thermal , low field \" limiting behavior@xcite :    @xmath6    here @xmath7 is the rms diffusion spread for carriers with charge @xmath8 after drifting through a distance @xmath9 in electric field @xmath10 with average ( thermal ) energy @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter _ @xmath4 _",
    "( the average thermal energy of a drifting charge carrier ) remained approximately equal to the room - temperature value , up to reduced drift fields as high as @xmath22.5 @xmath12 10@xmath13 v / m@xmath3torr .",
    "many chemical vapors at stp will capture thermal electrons to form negative ions@xcite .",
    "however , to maintain good track resolution the agent must have a capture mean free path of a hundred microns or less at a relatively low partial pressure .",
    "since gas gain is desired at the tpc endcaps , the agent must also relinquish its electrons in the high , strongly inhomogeneous field of the gain structures , allowing townsend avalanches to form .  in all previous work",
    ", cs@xmath1 has been used as the only capture agent fulfilling these requirements reasonably well .    while the nitpc has been successfully implemented with cs@xmath1 as the capture agent in dark matter observatories@xcite , the utility of the nitpc",
    "would be expanded by the identification of new capture agents .",
    "cs@xmath1 has a combination of low flash point ( -30@xmath14 c ) , high vapor pressure ( 400 torr ) and low explosive mixture limit in air ( 1.3%)which require great care in handling the material@xcite . nitromethane@xcite has a flash point far above room temperature and a vapor pressure less than a tenth that of cs@xmath1 .",
    "the comparative health effects of the two materials are indicated by the respective acgih threshold limit values of 1 ppm for cs@xmath1 vs. 20 ppm for nitromethane .",
    "cs@xmath1 also may form sulfide deposits under conditions of high rate or discharge .  more importantly ,",
    "new applications for the nitpc would be enabled by capture agents with different functional properties .",
    "for example , a single - ion counting nitpc with high energy resolution for double beta decay searches has been proposed@xcite that would benefit from a capture agent with higher ion mobility than cs@xmath1 .",
    "another example is photoelectric x - ray polarimetry below 10 kev with a nitpc , which requires capture agents with lower atomic number ( see below ) .",
    "photoelectric polarimeters derive their information by determining the photoelectron emission direction , which is strongly correlated with the electric field vector of the incident photon .  the most sensitive photoelectric polarimeters image the tracks of the photoelectrons with pixels small compared to the photoelectron track length and",
    "reconstruct the emission direction on an event - by - event basis .",
    "such polarimeters have been realized with optical avalanche chambers@xcite , micropattern gas detectors with direct pixel readout@xcite , and a micropattern tpc@xcite .",
    "x - ray polarimetry below 10 kev with a nitpc would benefit from low atomic number capture agents for several reasons .",
    "first , the correlation between the photoelectron emission direction and photon electric field is strongest for emission from s - orbitals@xcite , so it is preferable to use gases whose k - shell energies are well below the x - ray energy .",
    "second , the photoelectron is emitted with a kinetic energy that is the difference between the binding energy and the x - ray energy so that  lower z gases result in photoelectrons with larger kinetic energies and longer track lengths .",
    "finally , lower z gases have less multiple coulomb scattering , which results in straighter tracks and a better correlation between the photoelectron emission direction and photon electric field .",
    "therefore , motivated by the requirements of low energy x - ray polarimetry and guided by the chemical literature on electron capture , we have explored a number of compounds as alternative nitpc capture agents .",
    "we have identified nitromethane ( ch@xmath0no@xmath1 ) as a suitable capture agent for x - ray polarimetry which is also relatively benign .",
    "we present measurements of drift velocity , gas gain and longitudinal diffusion in gases with nitromethane as the capture agent .",
    "capture agents were screened for negative ion drift velocity , gas gain and longitudinal diffusion at low to moderate fields using a single - wire proportional counter attached to a homogeneous - field drift region .",
    "the apparatus was enclosed in a stainless steel bell jar with a simple gas manifold .",
    "drift fields up to 4.0 @xmath12 10@xmath15 v / m were used with this apparatus at reduced pressure .",
    "photoelectrons were generated at an sn photocathode attached to the drift - cathode .",
    "the photocathode was arranged so that it could be cleaned between runs using a glow discharge in pure argon .",
    "this was essential for maintaining the photoelectron yield .",
    "uv light flashes from an eg&g flash - pak@xcite were admitted into the bell jar through a quartz window , passed through a hole in the proportional counter wall , and struck the photocathode producing photoelectrons .",
    "the standard internal capacitors of the flash - pak were augmented with additional hv capacitors to give a stored energy of about 0.2 joule per pulse .",
    "the flash - pak was triggered by an external pulser , from which a time - zero signal was also derived .",
    "the proportional wire signal was read out through an ortec 142pc preamp and an ortec 579 shaping amplifier .",
    "drift times to the proportional wire and wire - signal time widths were measured with a digital oscilloscope .",
    "drift velocities and gas gain at moderate to high fields ( 1.0 @xmath12 10@xmath16 - 4.0 @xmath12 10@xmath16 v / m ) were measured in various gas mixtures with a micropattern gas detector ( mpgd ) having the same electrode structure as the gas electron multiplier@xcite , but assembled from two etched stainless steel meshes@xcite separated by a 100 @xmath17 m thick teflon spacer .  a drift electrode , also of stainless steel , was placed 10 mm above the mpgd cathode .",
    "the mpgd was operated at a gain of about 3000 .",
    "the mpgd cathode was instrumented with a charge - sensitive preamplifier followed by a bipolar shaping amplifier with a six microsecond shaping time constant .",
    "the mpgd cathode and drift electrode were simultaneously illuminated with a xenon flashlamp ( perkin - elmer pax-10 ) , which produced photoelectrons from both surfaces .",
    "photoelectrons from the cathode produced a prompt pulse , while the photoelectrons from the drift electrode produced negative ions and gave a pulse delayed by the drift time across the 10 mm drift distance .  the drift time was measured by averaging 100 pulses on a digital oscilloscope and taking the difference between the zero - crossing times of the prompt and the delayed pulses .",
    "nitromethane is known to have a large capture cross section for thermal electrons@xcite .  however , at moderate to high drift fields the pure near - saturated vapor at 20 torr produces both electron - drift and negative - ion - drift signals .",
    "this is understandable since a drift field of 5.0 @xmath12 10@xmath15 v / m at 20 torr is already a reduced field of 2500 v / m@xmath18torr , easily high enough to raise the energy of drifting electrons out of the thermal range before they could be captured .",
    "co@xmath1 was therefore added to the nitromethane vapor .",
    "co@xmath1 is known to be very effective in thermalizing drifting electrons , due to its large inelastic scattering cross sections@xcite .",
    "mixtures of 20 torr nitromethane with 50 torr or more of co@xmath1 were found to have satisfactory characteristics as negative ion drift mixtures .",
    "drift velocity and diffusion results for the nitromethane : co@xmath1 20:50 mixture are shown in figures [ fig : low_vel ] and [ fig : diff ] .",
    "the drift velocity rises linearly with drift field , with mobility ( 4.27 @xmath19 .03 ) @xmath20 10@xmath21 m@xmath22/v@xmath3sec and a small positive intercept ( 1.44 @xmath19 .08 m / s ) .",
    "the diffusion is studied by plotting the square of the pulse width in time as a function of 1/(@xmath23 ) .",
    "the pulse width is expected to be the quadrature sum of the amplifier shaping time ( 10 @xmath17sec ) and the broadening due to diffusion .",
    "if the diffusion is governed by equation 1 , this plot will be linear in the region where diffusion dominates ( essentially the entire plot ) , with slope .",
    "fitting figure [ fig : diff ] to a straight line gives t = 313 @xmath19 25 k.    drift velocities for higher pressure gas mixtures of nitromethane - co@xmath1-neon ,  nitromethane - co@xmath1-argon and nitromethane - ch@xmath24 were measured up to drift fields of 4.0 @xmath12 10@xmath16 v / m .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig : highv ] .",
    "the linear dependence of drift velocity on drift field persists up to these very high fields .",
    "results of linear fits for the mixtures studied are shown in table [ tab : neresults ] . shown in figure",
    "[ fig : gain ] are gas gain curves for higher pressure mixtures of co@xmath1-neon , and neon - co@xmath1-nitromethane .",
    "gains as high as several thousands were obtained in all mixtures demonstrating the ability of nitromethane as a feasible , productive detector gas .",
    "a negative ion drift mixture of nitromethane with co@xmath1 is found to have linear drift velocity vs. field and to exhibit thermal - limit longitudinal diffusion up to drift fields as high as 2.8 @xmath12 10@xmath15 v / m .",
    "higher pressure mixtures with argon , neon , ch@xmath24 and co@xmath1 also show linear drift velocity up to fields as high as 4.0 @xmath12 10@xmath16 v / m .  all mixtures exhibit stable operation as nitpcs .",
    "the introduction of nitromethane as an electron capture agent will enable the use of the nitpc as an x - ray polarimeter in the 1 - 10 kev band .",
    "the low drift velocity of the nitpc greatly eases the difficulty of calibrating drift velocity and substantially reduces power consumption , which is particularly important for satellite - borne astronomical instruments .",
    "the low diffusion of the nitpc will also enable large - volume photoelectric polarimeters that could be used , for example , as wide field - of - view instruments for unpredictable astronomical transients , such as gamma - ray bursts , or with rotation modulation collimators for high - resolution imaging polarimetry of solar flares@xcite ."
