    "activated - escape in systems with metastable states underlies many physical , chemical and biological problems .",
    "examples are crystal growth , tunnel diode , lasers , quantum liquids , spin systems , protein folding and polymer physics @xcite .",
    "the most interesting and stubborn case of metastable state is one described by time dependent potential , which fluctuates on a characteristic time scale that may vary over a large range . in particular , the metastable states with fluctuating barriers",
    "are common to chemical and biological models @xcite , and to a wide range of physical problems , such as nonequilibrium transport models , molecular dissociation in strongly coupled chemical systems @xcite , ratchet models for the action of molecular motors @xcite , noise in microstructures and generation process of carrier traps in semiconductors @xcite . the escape from metastable state with fluctuating or randomly switching barrier was studied in the past mainly by well known mean first passage time ( mfpt ) technique . in refs .",
    "@xcite exact results for the mfpt of escape process over fluctuating barrier that switches between two configurations have been obtained",
    ". however , the mfpt method requires the implication of absorbing boundary in the system , and it does not take into account the inverse probability current through this boundary .",
    "the nonlinear relaxation time ( nlrt ) method is devoid of this disadvantage @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the theory for the nlrt is not well developed and the equations for the nlrt are unknown for the case of time varying potential . + in the present paper we derive general equations for the nlrt for potentials randomly switching between two arbitrary configurations with a sink .",
    "we find the exact solution of these equations for a piece - wise linear potential flipping between unstable and metastable configurations , for arbitrary white noise intensity and fluctuation rate of the potential .",
    "analyzing this exact result we focus on the noise enhanced stability ( nes ) effect , which implies that the system remains in the metastable state for a longer time than in the absence of additive white noise , and the lifetime of the metastable state has a maximum at some noise intensity .",
    "this effect , which can not be described by kramers - like behavior , was observed and investigated theoretically and experimentally in various physical systems and mainly concerning mfpt in periodically or randomly driven metastable states @xcite . in these papers",
    "the nonmonotonic behavior of the average escape time was observed : ( i ) in physical systems , like tunnel diode @xcite , and josephson junction @xcite , where the influence of thermal fluctuations on the superconductive state lifetime and the turn - on delay time for a single josephson element with high damping was investigated ; ( ii ) in chemical systems , like the one - dimensional return map of the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction , by investigating the behavior of the lenght of the laminar region as a function of the noise intensity @xcite , and ( iii ) in biologically motivated models , such that investigated in ref @xcite , where the overdamped motion of a brownian particle moving in an asymmetric fluctuating potential shows noise induced stability .",
    "+ here we study the nes phenomenon for the nlrt in randomly switching metastable state , and we obtain analytically the region of system parameters , where this effect takes place .",
    "we find also resonant activation phenomenon by investigating the mean lifetime as a function of switchings mean rate .",
    "moreover , we find that the nlrt exhibits a maximum as a function of barrier switching rate . this new resonant - like phenomenon is related to the nes effect @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in the second section",
    "we derive the general equations for the nonlinear relaxation time of brownian diffusion in randomly switching potential with a metastable state . in the third section",
    "we analytically derive the mean lifetime for piece - wise linear potential . in the next section",
    "we obtain the condition to observe the nes phenomenon and investigate the behavior of the mean life time as a function of switchings mean rate . in the final section",
    "we draw the conclusions .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional overdamped brownian motion in switching potential profile @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the brownian particle displacement , @xmath2 is the white gaussian noise with zero mean and correlation function @xmath3 .",
    "the potential @xmath4 is the sum of two terms : the fixed potential @xmath5 and the randomly switching term @xmath6 . the variable @xmath7 is the markovian dichotomous noise , which takes the values @xmath8 with the mean flipping rate @xmath9 .",
