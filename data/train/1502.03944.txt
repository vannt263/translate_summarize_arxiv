    "hydraulic fracturing plays an important role in improving the productivity of damaged wells and wells producing .",
    "the vertical plane fracture is created by injecting fluid into the formation and then filling with proponing agents , such as propants , to prevent closure . in practical terms , two types of fractured well",
    "are considered : infinite ( high ) or finite ( low ) conductivity vertical fracture . in case of infinite conductivity fracture , it is assumed that the fluid flows along the fracture without any pressure drop .",
    "finite conductivity fracture occurs when the pressure drop along the fracture plane is not negligible .",
    "the classical diffusion equation has been used to explain the pressure responses of a well in a reservoir , which is assumed to be homogenous at all scales .",
    "however , recent studies show that the homogeneity assumption is not valid in most cases @xcite . due to this",
    "fact , fractal geometry has been used as an effective tool to describe the heterogeneities of these reservoirs , which are called fractal reservoirs @xcite .",
    "since the diffusion process of fractal reservoirs is history dependent , and the anomalous diffusion properties of fractal reservoirs can not be fully described by the fractal model , the concept of fractional derivative has been used to incorporate the memory of the fluid flow @xcite .",
    "our main aim here is to analyze the pressure behavior of a well with an infinite conductivity vertical fracture in a fractal reservoir .",
    "an infinite radial system is considered in order to analyze the effects of different parameters on the well response .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this brief introduction , the mathematical model is formulated in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "a summary of the nomenclature used appears in appendix  [ sec : append ] . the analytical solution to the model",
    "is provided in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] discusses how the well responses to different reservoir parameters .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are given in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "a schematic diagram of a vertically hydraulic fractured well is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the geometry of flow lines near the fractured well .        before discussing the mathematical model of transport process , we define three variables :    * the dimensionless pressure @xmath0 * the dimensionless time @xmath1 * the dimensionless radius @xmath2    see appendix  [ sec : append ] for the description of all the quantities involved .",
    "the best known and most useful model to describe the pressure behavior of fractal reservoirs was firstly proposed by metzler et al .",
    "similarly to camacho - velzquez et al .",
    "@xcite , from here on we call _ generalized diffusion equation _ to the fractal - fractional diffusion ( ffd ) equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 denotes the mass fractal dimension , while @xmath6 represents the conductivity index .",
    "mass fractal dimension is responsible for the reservoir structure , and the conductivity index explains the diffusion process in the reservoir .",
    "the caputo fractional order derivative is used to introduce @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 represents the gamma function , that is , @xmath12    the order @xmath13 of the fractional derivative is related to the conductivity index by @xmath14 .",
    "it is assumed that the pressure distribution of the reservoir is uniform and constant at initial time : @xmath15 to obtain the line source solution of equation , we take @xmath16 . the inner boundary condition without wellbore storage and skin effects can then be written as @xmath17 the outer boundary condition for the infinite reservoir is given by @xmath18 taking the laplace transform to both sides of , and then using , we obtain that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the laplace transform variable .",
    "the dependent variable @xmath21 denotes the laplace transform of @xmath22 , and is a function of @xmath23 and @xmath20 . in the laplace space",
    ", the inner boundary condition takes the form @xmath24 while the outer boundary condition is given by @xmath25 using the substitutions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and after a slight manipulation , we conclude that is equivalent to @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "equation is bessel s equation , which has the general solution @xmath30 thus , the dimensionless pressure function in laplace space can be written as @xmath31.\\ ] ] application of the outer boundary condition to yields @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , reduces to @xmath33 based on , the inner boundary condition can be written as @xmath34 equation can be simplified by using the formula @xmath35 valid for small arguments @xmath36 . indeed , having in mind that @xmath37 , and by making use of , we reduce to the following expression : @xmath38 consequently , @xmath39 equation can be written as @xmath40 we obtain the pressure drop function , in a fractal reservoir with a hydraulic fracture across the well , by integrating with respect to @xmath41 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 : @xmath44 d{\\alpha _ 1}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since the computation of the pressure along the fracture is favorable , it can be assumed that @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the pressure drop function reduces to @xmath46 where @xmath47 . by changing variables , and after further manipulations , can be written as @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the integrals in can be computed by the following formula : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 represents the generalized hypergeometric function . for the euclidean model , that is , the particular case @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the presented integrals can be evaluated by @xmath55 or @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are modified struve functions given by @xmath60 the inverse transform operation is easily carried out by using the gaver ",
    "stehfest algorithm @xcite .",
    "to show the pressure - transient behavior of a fractured well , we use to compute the wellbore pressure response at @xmath61 ( uniform flux solution ) , without wellbore storage and skin effects .",
    "the well intercepts the center of a single vertical fracture plane . according to the uniform flux fracture assumption ,",
    "the flow rate per unit of fracture surface is constant along the fracture length .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the different behavior of a well response in a homogenous and fractal reservoir .",
    "generally , the fracture structure works as a sink , which enforces the fluid to go towards the fracture with hyperbolical flow geometry .",
    "the geometry of fracture enforces the flow lines to be perpendicular to the fracture plane and the pressure - transient response defines a linear flow in the reservoir . after the linear flow regime , when the effect of fluid flow reaches the two ends of the fracture , the geometry of flow can be identified , for a small time , by a hyperbolical flow regime .",
    "ultimately , the characteristic radial flow regime is observed from the well response .",
    "the linear flow regime can be identified by two straight - lines of pressure and its logarithmic derivative at early times ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) . as can be seen from figure  [ fig3 ] ,",
    "these two parallel straight - lines have a half slope during the linear flow regime in a conventional reservoir . the specialized analysis ( cartesian coordinates ) on figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "shows that with a plot of the pressure change versus the square root of the elapsed time , the linear flow can be identified with a straight - line intercepting the origin .",
    "the results of figure  [ fig4 ] show that the slope of the straight - line is decreasing with the increasing of the parameter @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , in a more complex reservoir , described by a larger value of the conductivity index @xmath6 and a smaller value of the mass fractal dimension @xmath5 , the linear flow is identified with a smaller slope of the straight - line in the specialized plot .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] indicates that the radial flow regime ( at late times ) is identified by the straight - line shape of the logarithmic derivative in log - log scale and that the reservoirs with more complex structures ( larger values of @xmath62 ) have the straight - lines with larger slopes .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig3 ] shows that in a fractal reservoir , at late times during the radial flow regime , the pressure response and its logarithmic derivative are parallel straight - lines .",
    "this fact indicates that the pressure and its logarithmic derivative can be expressed by two power - law functions with the same power .     and @xmath63 versus @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "]     versus @xmath68 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ]",
    "the reservoir rock porosity is a statistical property of the system , and can be expressed as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a reference porosity value at the reference length @xmath71 .",
    "particularly , the reference length is the wellbore radius , and the porosity of a fractal reservoir can be written as @xmath72 .",
    "the reference porosity value can be assumed to be equal to the porosities obtained from log and core data .",
    "however , based on log and core porosities , the reasonable oil - in - place estimates indicate that the porosity variations are not big , and can be considered equal to the constant reference porosity .",
    "it can be therefore immediately concluded that the mass fractal dimension @xmath5 is equal to the euclidean dimension , that is , @xmath73 .",
    "on the other hand , because @xmath74 and , particularly , @xmath75 , the deficiencies of average permeability calculations indicate that the dynamical properties of the system have an important role in the flowing fluid through the reservoir and in all stages of production . since @xmath73 , the permeability variations can be expressed by @xmath76 .",
    "so , it requires investigating the effect of the conductivity index @xmath6 variations on the well response . as can be seen from figure  [ fig5 ] , by increasing the @xmath6 values , the pressure responses and their logarithmic derivatives increase . for a constant - rate production , more pressure drops in reservoirs with a more complicated diffusion process ( larger @xmath6 ) indicates that the diffusion is slower in these types of reservoirs .",
    "therefore , application of the conventional model solutions to such reservoirs may lead the analyst to a wrong interpretation .     and @xmath77 versus @xmath64 with @xmath73 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we used fractional calculus to model an infinite conductivity vertically fractured well in a fractal reservoir with more realistic behavior than the conventional ( homogeneous ) reservoirs .",
    "an analytical solution was obtained , allowing us to analyze and interpret the well test data taken from these types of wells and reservoirs . on the basis of our results , the simulated examples and the discussion presented",
    ", the following conclusions can be expressed :    * the euclidean interpretation model can not be used to analyze the pressure - transient behavior of fractal reservoirs ; * the obtained solution can be used as a practical tool to analyze the effects of dynamical properties of the system ; * according to the shortcomings of the average permeability estimates , the analytical solution can be used to determine the conductivity index parameter @xmath6 and then the permeability variations .",
