    "the timing between consecutive human actions , or even spacing the most simple and inconsequential motor activities  @xcite , is known to be scale - free , and despite recent efforts  @xcite , their mechanisms remain poorly understood .",

    "the lack of plausible models to account for these statistical features calls for alternatives able to identify the essential underlying mechanisms . to that end",
    ", it may be advantageous to uncouple the interference of memory and other cognitive factors , present in the experiments with human subjects , by analyzing a more elementary process , namely the records of long - term spontaneous motor activity of laboratory animals .    in the present work ,",
    "the activity of rats was recorded during several days . and the experimental data series analyzed from the perspective of a point process .",
    "the results show striking similarities with the scaling demonstrated to be exhibited by humans in more elaborated settings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the experimental details are described .",
    "section iii contains the statistical analysis , first for the inter - event times , then for the rates of motion events and finally for the variance of counts .",

    "animals were individually isolated into transparent cages of 25@xmath325@xmath312 cm with food pellets and tap water ad libitum .",
    "they were exposed to a 24-hour cycle of light - dark conditions : cycles of 12 hs of light ( fluorescent lamps with intensity of 300 lux ) and 12 hs of darkness ( dim red light with intensity less than 0.1 lux )  @xcite .    ,",

    "given the sensor s sensitivity the detection includes even minute head motion , grooming , etc .",
    "an example of the recording for the first three days is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tseries ] , where changes from activity to immobility , and viceversa , are marked by a vertical bar , with a resolution of 1  s. in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : tseries ] , we also show the group average of the activity rate @xmath4 , which is a coarse graining of the raw data , exhibiting the well known circadian rhythmicity .",
    "our interest here focuses exclusively on understanding the dynamics of the irregular fluctuations and not on the circadian periodicity .",
    "the spatial and temporal resolution of our experimental setting is such that , from the original ( binary ) data recorded , we can precisely estimate the duration of motion ( sequences of 1 s ) and immobility ( sequences of 0 s ) episodes .",
    "thus , the animal motor activity can be interpreted as a point process where the beginning of a motion event occurs at a definite discrete time @xmath5 .",
    "the point process can be then specified by the sequence of event times @xmath5 or , alternatively , by the series of increments ( or inter - event intervals ) @xmath6 . a typical plot of the @xmath7-series is presented in fig .",

    "it can be described by a superposition of two exponentials with characteristic times of the order of 1 s and 4 s , close to the smaller data resolution and to the average duration of motion episodes , respectively .",
    "let us note that , for human ( arm ) motor activity data , instead of two exponentials , a stretched exponential fit was reported  @xcite .    meanwhile , quiescence intervals are also power - law distributed with exponent @xmath10 . because motion intervals are in average much shorter than quiet ones , then , the statistics of inter - event times is mainly dominated by that of immobility periods , in particular , sharing the same power - law decay .",

    "their power - law behaviors indicate that the temporal support of the spikes of activity is a fractal - like set with dimension @xmath45 .",
    "shuffling the series of inter - event intervals modifies both factors , mostly by reducing the upper bound of the power - law scaling region .",

    "the observed super - poissonian behavior discussed in the previous section points in the direction of a multiplicative or clustering process , where the occurrence of an event increases the probability of a subsequent one  @xcite .",
    "a class of clustering poisson process was introduced by grneis  @xcite , where there is a primary poisson process triggering the occurrence of a sequences of events ( clusters ) , each following a secondary poisson process . in each cluster",

    "the same difficulty applies to other fractal or fractal - rate stochastic point processes  @xcite .",
    "recall also that , for many processes cited in ref .",
    "@xcite , solely the distribution of rates is scale - free , while inter - event times present a more trivial statistics . in the present case ,",
    "however , inter - event times are not only scale - free but also present long - range correlations , indicating non renewal processes .",
    "it is plausible that animal activity is triggered when an internal dynamical state variable reaches some value . without being too specific ,",
    "an animal can move to eat when sugar level reaches some low value , for instance .",
    "of course , biological reality will indicate that nothing in the judgement of the state variable nor in the threshold value can be very precise .",
    "therefore , one can imagine a quantity relaxing towards a fluctuating threshold that resets upon crossing it .",
    "variants of this scenario are very common in the the literature where fluctuations are introduced in either the threshold level or in the activation function  @xcite .",

    "if the decay has the shape @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the time of the previous adjacent trigger , then the power - law distribution of inter - event times has exponent @xmath74  @xcite . in particular @xmath75 , yields @xmath69 close to the observed values , and as soon as @xmath66 approaches zero ( abrupt decay ) , the exponent can increase up to a value slightly smaller than 2 . this relaxation ruled by @xmath66",
    "might explain the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite of @xmath76 in depressed individuals and @xmath77 in control ones .",
    "besides the inter - event time distributions , the other main correlation features seen in the data are reproduced as displayed by the @xmath37 and @xmath38 measures ( notice , though , the relatively larger dip for short @xmath20 in the @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is known that the model dynamics yields @xmath58 spectral properties  @xcite .",
    "we have verified ( not shown ) that the inter - event times are power - law correlated and that the distribution of rates is scale free , as observed for real data , although the exponents are different for the chosen set of parameter values .",
    "overall , this simple model is able to reproduce the observed phenomenology and it is known to be robust under the addition of noise over the activation signal  @xcite .",
    "finally , the duration of individual events could also be incorporated easily into the model by an additional integration process consistent with the observed statistics .",
    "in summary , the results show that animal motion is scale free in all of the relevant statistics analyzed and that the scaling is introduced by the length of the inactivity pauses as well as its specific ordering .",
    "these results are robust for all animals studied , and invariant when day and night data are analyzed separately .",
    "while motion episodes do possess a definite timescale and are basically exponentially distributed , the distribution of inter - event intervals are scale - free over many timescales , from a few up to thousands of seconds .",
    "scaling is also demonstrated in the the rates of occurrence , rejecting a non - homogeneus poisson process as responsible for the dynamics .    at even longer time scales than the ones considered here , many human actions exhibit also bursty patterns , in which short time intervals of intensive activity are ( frequently ) separated by long gaps without activity  @xcite . in that case , the power - law tails of inter - event distributions have been attributed to queuing processes ( where the queue represents the tasks on a priority list ) .",
    "depending on the dynamics of the priority list , different classes of universality can emerge  @xcite .",
    "probably this is not the case in the present experiments , where more likely , an elementary physiological and/or environmental mechanism is behind .",
    "some of the scale - free properties here observed , have been reported before for human motor activity data as well  @xcite .",
    "the quantitative aspects for the scaling laws were reported to remain unchanged under usual daily activities or periodic scheduled work .",
    "these observations were consistent with earlier results from the study of timeseries of heartbeat intervals  @xcite from healthy humans .",
    "then , it have prompted the suggestion of multi - scale physiological mechanisms as responsible for the presence of long - term correlated dynamics  @xcite .",
    "other related approaches  @xcite consider that animal motion could be visualized as the output of a large nonlinear dynamical system ( e.g. , the brain - body - environment ensemble ) whose repertoire includes the kind of dynamics observed in these experiments .",
    "finally , the possibility that the complexity of the environment in itself influences animal behavior needs to be carefully considered  @xcite .",
    "the specific mechanism discussed here , involving a fluctuating - threshold controlled dynamics is biologically plausible , and not only can replicate observed features of the statistical structure of rat motor activity , but with appropriate modifications can be used to provide insights about the long - term rhythms alterations observed on individuals with mood disorders , depression and other neurological disorders , such as chronic pain .",
