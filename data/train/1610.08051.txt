    ", the two solutions can not both correspond to minima of @xmath51 .",
    "hence , one solution stems from a maximum and the other from a minimum . since the right side of eq",

    "@xmath101 . this",

    "we see that for small coupling strengths , @xmath99 has one local minimum only which is located at @xmath102 , the trivial solution . if the coupling strength is increased , a maximum - minimum pair forms at finite values of @xmath79 . in general , this local minimum at @xmath103 is energetically higher than the local minimum of the trivial solution at @xmath102 , cf .",

    ", @xmath88 measures the macroscopic occupation of the bosonic modes and can therefore serve as an order parameter of the phase transition . hence , in the parameter regime where the trivial solution minimises @xmath51 , the system is in the normal phase .",
    "in addition , above the coupling strengths @xmath109 , @xmath51 is minimised by non - zero values of either @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "the first corresponds to the red superradiant phase , the latter to the blue superradiant phase of ref .",
    "the two superradiant phases at non - zero temperatures show only one macroscopically occupied bosonic mode as well ; mode one for the blue superradiant phase and mode two for the red superradiant phase , while the occupation of the other mode is zero .    as we have seen in the previous section , the location of the global minimum @xmath88 jumps from the trivial solution to non - zero solutions .",
    "a jump of the order parameter defines a first - order phase transition .",

    "in addition , since @xmath160 shows no additional maximum , we have a continuous phase transition in this quantum limit .",
    "furthermore , we can also compute the position of the minimum of @xmath51 . in the limit @xmath161 , eq .",
    "reads @xmath162 solving for @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath163 if we identify @xmath79 with the mean - fields @xmath164 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we reproduce our results @xcite for the superradiant phases of the quantum phase transition of the lambda - model .    the mean - fields @xmath165 of ref .",
    "@xcite can be reproduced as well .",
    "consider for instance @xmath166 which is related to @xmath151 through @xmath167 , except for a possible phase .",
    "using the results for the boltzmann operator in the red superradiant phase , eq .  , plus the above expression for @xmath85 , eq .",
    ", and finally insert everything into the expectation value of eq .  , we obtain @xmath168 \\omega},\\ ] ] which in the zero - temperature limit @xmath169 reduces to @xmath170 here , @xmath171 from eq .  .",
    "if we finally insert the position @xmath85 of the minimum of the free energy , eq .  , the population of the third single - particle energy level in the zero - temperature limit is given by @xmath172\\ ] ] which agrees with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath166 .",
    "applying the same technique , we can obtain the expectation values of all other collective atomic operators @xmath71 in both superradiant phases .",
    "this again coincides with the results of ref .",
    "we have analysed the lambda - model in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures using the partition sum of the hamiltonian .",
    "compared to the quantum phase transition of this model  @xcite , we found that at finite temperatures the properties of the phases and phase transition partially persist .",
    "namely , we found three phases : a normal and two superradiant phases .",
    "these have the same properties as in the quantum limit . for small couplings and/or at high temperatures ,",
    "the system is in the normal phase where all particles are in their respective single - particle ground - state and both bosonic modes are in their vacuum state . if one of the coupling strengths is increased above a temperature - dependent critical coupling strength , the system undergoes a phase transition into a superradiant phase wich is characterised by a macroscopic occupation of one of the bosonic modes only and a spontaneaous polarisation of the corresponding branch of the three - level system .",
    "a new characteristic of the phase transition at finite temperatures is the appearance of first - order phase transitions only . for the quantum phase transition we already found first - order phase transitions between the normal and the red superradiant phase and between the two superradiant phases .",
    "here , at finite temperatures , the phase transition from the normal to the blue superradiant phase becomes a first - order phase transition as well .",
    "this change of the order of the phase transition would appear for a single bosonic mode as well .",
    "hence , it is due to the additional single - particle energy level that first - order phase transitions show up .",
    "in addition , we emphasise that even in the degenerate limit , @xmath173 , the phase transitions from the normal to both superradiant phases are of first order .",
    "it is remarkable that in contrast to the original dicke model , the mean - field phase transitions at finite temperatures are not continuous .",
    "this facet becomes significant if _ real _ atoms and photons are considered . here",
    ", for the original dicke model with its continuous phase transition , there exists a no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "however for first - order mean - field quantum phase transitions , it is known @xcite that this no - go theorem does not apply and superradiant phase transitions occur .",
    "we expect an identical conclusion for the lambda - model at finite temperatures .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft within the sfb 910 , the grk 1558 , and the projects br 1528/82 and 1528/9 .",
    "we calculate the expectation value of functions @xmath63 of operators of the two bosonic modes as , @xmath174 in the last step we used that the exponential dominates for large @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the function @xmath63 can be considered constant and the remaining integral plus the prefactor is equal to the partition sum ."
