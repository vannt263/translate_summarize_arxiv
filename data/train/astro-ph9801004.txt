    "recent cdm - based numerical simulations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite have shown that the ly@xmath0 forest clouds are a natural consequence of structure formation in the intergalactic gas , and a general picture @xcite,@xcite has emerged within which their properties may be understood . in particular , the low column density ( @xmath6 ) forest corresponds to underdense or slightly overdense regions in the igm , which are easily modeled or analytically simulated , and which contain a substantial fraction of the baryonic material in the intergalactic gas .",
    "studies of this component over as wide a redshift range as possible can provide information which : ( 1 ) constrains models for structure formation , ( 2 ) provides normalization for studies of he , and ( 3 ) addresses the evolution of the shape and normalization of the ionizing background radiation .    the advent of large , homogeneous data sets from the keck i 10-m telescope obtained with the hires spectrograph at high resolution ( @xmath7 ) and high signal - to - noise @xcite,@xcite has made it possible to explore the evolution of the low column density forest in some detail .",
    "the present analysis uses data from the spectra of five quasars ( q1623 + 268 , q1700 + 643 , q0014 + 813 , q0302003 , q1422 + 231 ) which span a redshift range from @xmath8 , and whose forest clouds have been analyzed over a range from @xmath9 .",
    "this wavelength region was chosen to sample the ` quiet ' forest , and to avoid the region of the proximity effect , and in the case of two partial lyman limit systems , to avoid the region within @xmath10 km s@xmath11 of these systems .",
    "we have extended the redshift range treated in this work to @xmath12 using the results ( @xmath13 ) of lu et al .",
    "1996 @xcite , who employ a different fitting algorithm but use similar modeling analysis to correct for selection effects and incompleteness .",
    "details of the profile fitting can be significant @xcite , as is discussed in more detail by kim et al .",
    "@xcite in these proceedings , and a consistent analysis over the full redshift range using a single procedure should ultimately be carried out , but the lu et al .",
    "data seems fully consistent with the extrapolated trends from @xmath14 .",
    "the spectrum of hi column densities can be characterized by a power law with slope @xmath5 over a wide range of column densities ( figure  1 ) but with a marked deficiency of clouds relative to this fit in the region @xmath15 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "kim et al.s 1997 @xcite analysis of the differential density distribution function ( ddf ) by redshift interval clearly shows an evolution in the departure from the power - law fit ( figure  2 ) . in the left - hand panel of figure  2",
    "the @xmath16 data @xcite show only a slight steepening ( _ dotted line _ ) at the higher column densities , but by @xmath17 a deficiency in the number density of clouds at @xmath18 can be seen , while clouds at @xmath19 and @xmath20 show deviations from the power - law extrapolation at @xmath21 .",
    "this departure from a power law can be easily seen in the right - hand panel of figure  2 , where the distribution functions of the @xmath22 ( _ diamonds _ ) and @xmath17 ( _ triangles _ ) absorbers , now corrected for incompleteness , are shown .",
    "there are _ no _ clouds with @xmath23 at @xmath22 despite the fact that the redshift path is 1.5 times larger than at @xmath17 , so the deficiency of high column density clouds in the lower redshift range is not due to observational selection . we conclude that we are seeing a rapid evolution with redshift in the number density of absorbers at high column density , with the break in the density distribution function strengthening and migrating to lower column densities as redshift decreases .    turning to the number density evolution of ly@xmath0 clouds with redshift , where the number density of clouds per unit redshift per line of sight is expressed as : @xmath24 , we can compare the keck data on the high redshift systems with the low redshift systems studied with _",
    "@xcite,@xcite , while keeping in mind that @xmath25 will be sensitive to the adopted threshold @xmath26 ( a reflection of the departure from the single power - law description at @xmath27 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows a plot of log@xmath28 vs. log@xmath29 giving the maximum likelihood fit to the _ hst _ data and the high column density keck data ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the adopted column density range used for the fit , @xmath31 , corresponds approximately to the conventional equivalent width threshold of @xmath32    for comparisons with the lower redshift data @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the best fit to the slope of @xmath25 for the low column density systems in the keck data is @xmath33 .",
    "the definition of @xmath25 yields @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 in the case of non - evolving clouds , and the slopes for the data in different column density ranges in figure  3 can be understood in terms of the evolution of the break in the ddf : the number density of the higher column density systems ( @xmath30 ) is evolving rapidly , while the number density of the lower column density systems ( @xmath38 ; @xmath39 ) is not .",
    "a second interesting issue is the evolution of line - widths , characterized by the doppler parameter @xmath2 obtained from profile fitting , whose behavior reflects the thermal / ionization history of the igm @xcite .",
    "hu 1995 @xcite found a typical mean @xmath2 of 28 km  s@xmath11 with a minimal @xmath40 = 20 km  s@xmath11 from the analysis of @xmath41 systems . at @xmath42 lu @xcite report a mean @xmath2 of 23 km  s@xmath11 and cutoff @xmath40 = 15 km  s@xmath11 , showing a trend to narrower absorbing components at higher redshift .    in order to quantify these descriptions , it is important to run model simulations to understand the nature of blending , selection , and incompleteness effects on the analysis of the observed data .",
    "the procedure used @xcite,@xcite is to input a truncated gaussian distribution for the doppler parameter values , generate a series of simulated artifical spectra , and then apply the standard profile - fitting methods to match the recovered column densities and @xmath2 values to the input spectra and to the observations .",
    "both the cutoff and median @xmath2 values appear to increase with decreasing redshift  the cutoff @xmath2 value s increase from 15 km  s@xmath11 at @xmath16 , to @xmath43 at @xmath17 , to @xmath44 at @xmath19 , to @xmath45 at @xmath46 presumably reflecting an increase in the turbulent and thermal broadening over this period .",
    "in broad outline the cloud evolution described here probably follows naturally from the decreasing igm density with decreasing redshift , which drives down the column density at which shocking occurs @xcite , and the increasing level of structure which results in more turbulent components .",
    "however , reproducing the results in detail will require full comparison with a wide suite of numerical models , which may provide useful constraints on the history of the ionization and heating of the igm .",
