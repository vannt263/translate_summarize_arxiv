    "important is that their intrinsic properties may be substantially modified in a controllable way by doping with extrinsic impurity atoms , molecules and compounds  @xcite .",
    "recent successful experiments on encapsulation of single atoms into single - wall cns  @xcite and their intercalation into single - wall cn bundles  @xcite , along with numerous studies of monoatomic gas absorbtion by the cn bundles ( see  @xcite for a review ) , stimulate an in - depth analysis of the atom - cn van der waals ( vdw ) interactions .",
    "the problem is both of fundamental and of applied interest , because it sheds light on the peculiarities of the atom - electromagnetic - field interactions in low - dimensional dispersive and absorbing surroundings , on the one hand , and , on the other , the atom - nanotube vdw interaction is the most important one determining the filling factor in encapsulating single atoms into cns .",
    "the vdw interaction is the result of electrodynamic coupling between the polarization states of the interacting entities that results from the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .  a theoretical analysis recently done  @xcite of spontaneous decay dynamics of excited atomic states near cns has brought out fascinating peculiarities of the vacuum - field interactions in atomically doped cns .",
    "in particular , close to the nanotube , the relative density of photonic states ( dos ) effectively increases due to the presence of additional surface photonic states coupled with cn electronic quasiparticle excitations .",
    "this causes an atom - vacuum - field coupling constant , which is proportional to the photonic dos , to be very sensitive to an atom - cn - surface distance .",
    "if the atom is close enough to the cn surface and the atomic transition frequency is in the vicinity of a resonance of the photonic dos , the system shows strong atom - vacuum - field coupling giving rise to rearrangement ( `` dressing '' ) of atomic levels by the vacuum - field interaction .  if the atom moves away from the cn surface , the atom - field coupling strength decreases , smoothly approaching the weak coupling regime at large atom - surface distances since the role of surface photonic states diminishes , causing the relative photonic dos to decrease .",
    "this suggests strictly nonlinear atom - field coupling and a primary role of the distance - dependent ( local ) photonic dos in the vicinity of the cn , so that ( weak - coupling ) vdw interaction models based upon standard vacuum quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) as well as those using the linear response theory ( see  @xcite for a review ) are , in general , inapplicable for an atom in a close vicinity of a carbon nanotube .    to give this issue a proper quantum electrodynamic consideration and thereby to advance in physical understanding the vdw interactions deeper than simple analyzing empirical model potentials  @xcite",

    "interesting is also the fact that the vdw energies of the atom outside the metallic nanotubes ( @xmath146 is divisible by 3 ) are on average a little bit smaller than those for the atom outside semiconducting ones .",

    "this is a principal signature of strong coupling of the excited atomic state to vacuum surface photonic modes in the cn .",
    "such a strongly coupled atomic state is nothing but a quasi-1d cavity polariton similar to quasi-0d excitonic ( electronic ) polaritons in quantum dot microcavities widely discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the study of such phenomena was started awhile ago in atomic physics  @xcite and still attracts a lot of interest especially in connection with research on quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the stability of quasi-1d atomic polaritons in cns is mainly determined by the atom - nanotube van der waals interaction .",
    "this interaction , however , originates from _ strong _ atom - field coupling and , therefore , can not be correctly described in terms of vacuum - qed - based ( weak - coupling ) vdw interaction models as well as in terms of those based upon the linear response theory .  in the present paper , we have developed a simple quantum mechanical approach to the ground - state vdw energy calculation of a ( two - level ) atomic system near a cn .",
    "the approach is based upon the perturbation theory for degenerated atomic levels , thus accounting for both weak and strong atom - field coupling and thereby covering the vdw interactions of the ground - state quasi-1d atomic polaritons in cns .  within the framework of this approach ,",
    "the vdw energy is described by the integral equation represented in terms of the local photonic dos .  by solving this equation numerically",
    ", we have demonstrated the inapplicability of weak - coupling - based vdw interaction models in a close vicinity of the nanotube surface where the local photonic dos effectively increases , giving rise to an atom - field coupling enhancement followed by the degeneracy of the unperturbed atomic levels due to the diamagnetic interaction term .",
    "the fundamental conclusion above is supplemented by those important for various applications of atomically doped cns in modern nanotechnology .",
    "in particular , we have studied cn surface curvature effects on the atom - nanotube vdw interactions and have shown that an inside encapsulation of doped atoms into the nanotube is energetically more favorable than their outside adsorption by the nanotube surface , in agreement with the experimental observations reported in ref .",
    "moreover , if the atom is fixed outside the cn in a way that the weak atom - field coupling regime is realized , i.e.  far enough from the cn surface , then the modulus of the atom - nanotube vdw energy increases with the cn radius because the effective atom - nanotube interaction area is larger for larger - radius nanotubes in this case .  for inside atomic position",

    "<S> we have investigated atom - nanotube van der waals ( vdw ) coupling in atomically doped carbon nanotubes ( cns ) .  our approach is based on the perturbation theory for degenerated atomic levels , thus accounting for both weak and strong atom - vacuum - field coupling .  </S>",
    "<S> the vdw energy is described by an integral equation represented in terms of the local photonic density of states ( dos ) .  by solving it numerically , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the inapplicability of standard weak - coupling - based vdw interaction models in a close vicinity of the cn surface where the local photonic dos effectively increases , giving rise to an atom - field coupling enhancement .  an inside encapsulation of atoms into the cn has been shown to be energetically more favorable than their outside adsorption by the cn surface .  </S>",
    "<S> if the atom is fixed outside the cn , the modulus of the vdw energy increases with the cn radius provided that the weak atom - field coupling regime is realized ( i.e. ,  far enough from the cn ) .  for inside atomic position </S>",
    "<S> , the modulus of the vdw energy decreases with the cn radius , representing a general effect of the effective interaction area reduction with lowering the cn curvature . </S>"
