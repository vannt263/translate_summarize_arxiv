    "persistent currents ( pc ) in normal meso- and nanorings pierced by external magnetic flux represent one of the fundamental consequences of quantum coherence of electron wave functions which at sufficiently low temperatures may persist at distances comparable with the system size . while the average value of pc was intensively investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite during last decades , little",
    "was known about equilibrium fluctuations of pc .    at non - zero @xmath4",
    "it is quite natural to expect non - vanishing thermal fluctuations of pc @xcite .",
    "somewhat less trivial is the limit @xmath5 when the system approaches its ( non - degenerate ) ground state . in this limit",
    "no pc fluctuations occur only provided the current operator @xmath6 commutes with the total hamiltonian @xmath7 of the system , otherwise fluctuations of pc do not vanish even provided the system remains exactly in its ground state @xcite .",
    "for instance , pc does fluctuate down to @xmath2 provided the ring is coupled to some external dissipative environment .",
    "this situation is encountered , e.g. , within the model @xcite where it was demonstrated that , while the average value of pc @xmath8 in the ground state decreases with increasing coupling with the environment , pc fluctuations remain non - zero and even increase with the coupling constant .    in the latter example interaction with the dissipative environment",
    "produces quantum decoherence which , in turn , causes suppression of pc @xmath8 even at @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "ground state fluctuations of pc can occur also in the absence of any decoherence .",
    "e.g. , the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 do not commute for a quantum particle on a ring in the presence of an external periodic potential .",
    "this model describes , e.g. , the properties of superconducting nanorings with quantum phase slips @xcite . in this case",
    "pc fluctuations do not vanish even in the ground state @xcite and , at the same time , quantum coherence remains fully preserved . as a result , the magnitude of pc fluctuations turns out to be sensitive to external magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "this observation implies that quantum coherence and decoherence in meso- and nanorings can be probed by measuring the equilibrium current noise in such systems .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to theoretically analyze such current noise in the presence of quantum decoherence produced by electron - electron interactions .",
    "note that the existing theory of quantum decoherence of electrons in disordered conductors with electron - electron interactions @xcite is rather complicated , merely because of the pauli principle which needs to be properly accounted for in such systems . at the same time , the basic physics of this phenomenon can be explained already without unnecessary complications : it is due to the electron interaction with the fluctuating quantum electromagnetic field produced by other electrons moving in a disordered conductor .",
    "hence , for the sake of physical transparency it is sometimes useful to employ a simplified model which mimics all key features of the `` real '' problem of interacting electrons in a disordered conductor except for the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this model @xcite deals with a quantum particle moving in a ring and interacting with some quantum dissipative environment .",
    "the latter could be , e.g. , a bath of caldeira - leggett oscillators or electrons in a disordered conductor . in the case of caldeira - leggett environment decoherence of a quantum particle on a ring",
    "was investigated with the aid of imaginary @xcite and real - time @xcite approaches which yield similar results , i.e. exponential suppression of quantum coherence down to @xmath2 at sufficiently large ring radii .",
    "in fact , the problem @xcite is exactly equivalent to that of coulomb blockade in a single electron box where exponential reduction of the effective charging energy at large conductances is also well established @xcite .",
    "the model of a particle in a diffusive electron gas was extensively used by different authors @xcite in order to investigate the effect of interaction - induced decoherence on the average value of pc .",
    "below we will employ the same model in order to study an interplay between pc fluctuations and quantum decoherence .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we define our model and describe our basic formalism of the influence functional . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze pc fluctuations within the framework of the perturbation theory in the interaction . in sec .",
    "4 we go beyond the perturbation theory and evaluate equilibrium current - current correlation functions in the limit of strong interactions .",
    "our main conclusions are outlined in sec .",
    "further technical details of our calculation are specified in appendices a and b.",
    "in our analysis we will employ a model @xcite of a quantum particle with mass @xmath9 on a 1d ring of radius @xmath0 pierced by magnetic flux @xmath1 . this quantum particle interacts with a dissipative environment ( bath ) described by some collective variable @xmath10 representing its degrees of freedom .",
    "the total hamiltonian for this system reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angle variable parameterizing the particle position on the ring , @xmath13 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the flux quantum .",

    "evaluating the symmetrized version of this correlator in equilibrium one arrives at pc noise power @xcite @xmath21 which represents the central object in our subsequent analysis .",

    "it is necessary to describe quantum dynamics of our system . for this purpose",

    "the weak disorder condition @xmath59 obviously implies @xmath60 , i.e. the coupling constant always remains small within the applicability range of our model .",
    "we also note that the above influence functional reduces to the caldeira - leggett one if we choose @xcite @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is effective viscosity of the caldeira - leggett bath ) , @xmath63 and @xmath58 for all @xmath64 .",
