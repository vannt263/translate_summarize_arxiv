    "when the strength of the magnetic field is further increased ( @xmath48 ) , we observe an additional set of resistance oscillations , which can not be explained by classical trajectories .",
    "the frequency of these oscillations increases rapidly whenever a landau level is pushed towards the fermi energy and a transition between hall plateaus appears ( compare solid and dashed curves in fig .",

    "moreover , when only two edge channels are occupied ( @xmath49 ) , the oscillations become very clear and regular . finally , the oscillations vanish completely , when only a single edge channel is occupied ( @xmath50 ) , and the typical hall plateau @xmath51 can be observed .",
    "this suggests that these oscillations are an interference phenomenon between the occupied edge channels as explained in the following .",
    "we start by solving the stationary schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) and an infinite potential wall along the @xmath52-axis . the hamiltonian can be rewritten as a harmonic oscillator , which is shifted by @xmath53 with @xmath54 and thus , the edge channels are given by@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a normalization constant .",

[ fig:1 ] ( dashed curve ) can be observed . ]    in intermediate fields , the current is carried by only a few edge channels and the focusing spectrum shows beatings due to the superposition of plane waves .",
