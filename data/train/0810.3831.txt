    "recent precision measurements of cosmological quantities , such as the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization @xcite and the supernova luminosity - to - distance relationship , together with large scale structure and structure formation studies @xcite , allowed to build a _",
    "standard cosmological model _",
    ", that describes a universe spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic at large scales .",
    "our universe consists of ordinary matter and radiation only for a 4.5% : as shown in figure [ fig : snproject ] , a considerable fraction of the total matter ( 23% ) is in the form of cold dark matter .",
    "the largest fraction ( 73% ) consists of dark energy , acting like a cosmological constant , whose origin is unknown @xcite .",
    "the antimatter  content of the universe appears to be only 10@xmath1 of the matter content @xcite .",
    "the aim of ams-02 is to perform precision studies of cosmic ray properties such as composition , production , acceleration and propagation mechanisms .",
    "its large acceptance , energy resolution and particle identification capabilities allow ams-02 to search for primordial antimatter  by direct detection of antinuclei , and for dark matter  annihilation products independently in different charged and neutral particles spectra .",
    "ams-02 is designed as a single particle spectrometer with large acceptance , high momentum range and efficient particle identification for reliable operation in space , to provide high statistics spectra of charged particles with nuclei and isotope separation , as well as gamma - ray measurements",
    ". it will carry out a 3-years mission taking data above the atmosphere on the international space station .",
    "ams-02 is shown in figure [ fig : ams ] .",
    "it consists of a fully equipped tracker inside a superconducting magnet ( the first ever to operate in space ) providing a 0.8 t m@xmath2 magnetic field .",
    "rigidity is measured up to 3 tev and nuclei and isotopes are separated up to 12 gev / n for z@xmath326 or a@xmath325 with a ring imaging aerogel / sodium - flouride cherenkov detector ( agl / naf rich ) , combined with time of flight ( tof ) and @xmath4 measurements . at 90% positron efficiency ,",
    "a proton suppression by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude is achieved with a lead / scintillating fibre sandwich 3d sampling calorimeter ( ecal ) based on shower shape information and the matching of shower energy with track momentum .",
    "further proton suppression by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude up to 300 gev / c is achieved with a 20 layer fibre fleece xe / co2 proportional wire straw tube transition radiation detector ( trd ) .",
    "the overall 10@xmath5 proton rejection factor is essential for dark matter  search .",
    "a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is the favoured dark matter  canditate , and supersymmetric extensions of the standard model such as msugra contain a _ neutralino _ which is stable when r - parity is conserved .",
    "ams-02 is capable of detectig wimps indirectly by measuring decay products of neutralino annihilation processes , as an extra source for positrons , antiprotons , antideuterons and gammas on top of standard model predictions from galactic propagation models . with annihilation cross sections proportional to the square of the neutralino density ,",
    "these measurements are also sensitive to dark matter  density fluctuations .",
    "recent measurements of gamma - ray fluxes @xcite and the positron fraction @xcite have shown deviations from standard model expectations which are consistent with supersymmetric dark matter , but controversial within the available statistics and without standard model explanation for the positron excess @xcite .",
    "ams-02 will measure the positron spectrum with substantially improved precision for background and signal , in the energy region where an excess has been claimed . moreover , the simultaneous measurement in other independent channels will increase the sensitivity to dark matter  detection .",
    "the spectra of positrons and antiprotons expected in the ams-02 sensitivity region are shown in figure [ fig : dm ] .",
    "ams-02 can also detect gamma rays up to 1 tev either directly in the ecal , or indirectly as an electron - positron pair after conversion in the material above the tracker , which amounts to 40% of a radiation length .",
    "the part of the parameter space from new physics that is within reach of ams-02 gamma measurements in the case of cuspy halo profile or extra enhancements , and even for a standard nfw dark matter halo @xcite , is also shown in figure [ fig : dm ] .              in the big bang theory matter and antimatter are created with equal abundances , and the disappearance of antimatter requires barion number violation and another source of cp violation .",
    "antiparticles are indeed produced in collisions between high energy particles , and are observed in the cosmic rays .",
    "for example , @xmath6 however , an anti - helium nucleus has very low probability of being produced in collisions : @xmath7 anti - helium detection in the cosmic rays would be a clear indication of the existence of an antimatter area somewhere in the universe .",
    "ams-02 will collect in three years @xmath8 nuclei with energies up to 2 tev , with a sensitivity that reaches anti - iron . the limit put by the precursor flight ams-01",
    "will be increased of a factor @xmath9 , meaning that , if no antinucleus is observed , there is no antimatter  to the edge of the observable universe ( about 1000 mpc ) .",
    "the limit on antimatter  presence they can be set by ams-02 is shown in figure [ fig : am ] .",
    "ams-02 will provide a coherent dataset of unprecedented precision for charged cosmic rays and gamma rays up to the tev region .    these data will confirm or disprove with high accuracy the excess in the heat positron data in the few gev region .",
    "the multichannel analysis will allow combined fits to the parameters of standard model extensions to establish the nature of dark matter .",
    "several models can be constrained and eventually ruled out .",
    "ams-02 will put a stringent limit on the presence of antimatter : if no antinucleus is observed , the hypothesis of barion asymmetry will be strongly favoured as no antimatter areas are present in the observable universe .",
    "in general , our knowledge of the cosmic rays physics will be improved .",
    "ams-02 will perform an accurate study of composition ( h , he , b / c , @xmath10be/@xmath11be ) and energy spectra , and put significant constraints on galactic propagation model parameters .",
