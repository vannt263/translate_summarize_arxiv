    "semiconductor nanowires are attracting increasing interest because of their exciting optical and electronic properties and the possibility of synthesizing them in a controllable fashion  @xcite .",
    "they are considered promising building blocks for the next generation of optical , sensing , electronic and energy harvesting devices  @xcite .",
    "their small diameters , often at distances a few times the inter - atomic spacing in crystals , and their unique geometries lead to physical properties which differ significantly from the corresponding bulk material .",
    "furthermore , nanowires hold the promise of integrating lattice - mismatched crystals on a single device , which opens new design possibilities and has the potential to significantly decrease production costs in solar cell applications@xcite .    the functionality of nanowires is increased , and their properties are modified , when radial or axial heterostructures are created within a single wire@xcite .",
    "radial heterostructures can be produced by growing different materials on the side facets of the nanowires @xcite , while axial heterostructures correspond generally to a variation in the chemical composition along the growth axis@xcite .",
    "recently , a second type of axial heterostructure has attracted attention , where the crystalline structure varies along the growth axis while the chemical composition is conserved .",
    "typically , the structure is changed from the cubic zinc - blende to the hexagonal wurtzite structure  @xcite .",
    "this change of crystalline structure has been observed in some bulk materials such as sic and gan  @xcite . in phosphides and arsenides , it has been shown that the appearance of wurtzite phase is restricted to the nanowire form and is never observed in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the change in crystal structure is accompanied by changes in the electronic structure ; for example , earlier theoretical work predicted a type ii band alignment between the zinc - blende and wurtzite phases in iii - v semiconductors @xcite .",
    "recently , type ii band alignment in inp nanowires  @xcite has been demonstrated allowing the formation of crystal phase qantum dots  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the band structure of wurtzite gaas has been a subject of controversy in the last few years .",
    "recent works on the luminescence of gaas nanowires with a high percentage of wurtzite phase show a large variety of results .",
    "recently luminescence of wurtzite gaas in the range of 1.53 - 1.54ev has been reported @xcite .",
    "previously , martelli _ et al .",

    "meanwhile moewe _ et al .",
    "_ reported an emission at 10mev below the zinc - blende gaas band gap@xcite . additionally , our own results presenting a mixture of wurtzite and zinc - blende phases in nanowires are consistent with a type ii band alignment and smaller band gap  @xcite . indeed in nanowires presenting 30% and 70% wurtzite phase we have observed extremely sharp peaks 1.43 and 1.515ev  @xcite .",
    "the spectra could be explained by the existence of quantum heterostructures forming a type ii band alignment  @xcite .",
    "additionally similar results have been obtained by other groups  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the apparent contradictions of some of these literature results can be related to the fact that the optical and structural characterizations were not performed on the same nanowire .",
    "this limits the possibilities to account for variability in the structure of different nanowires from one growth . in this work",
    "we will perform a direct correlation between the structural and optical properties in order to overcome this limitation .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", a direct correlation between the optical properties and the structural sequence in the polytypism , which requires both functional and structural characterization on the the same nanowire , has not yet been demonstrated  @xcite .",

    "the grids were fixed freely suspended to a sample holder mounted in a confocal micro - photoluminescence ( @xmath10pl ) setup .",
    "the sample stick was then immersed in a liquid helium bath cryostat . in order to ensure a good thermal dissipation during the optical measurements ,",
    "the sample space was filled with a helium exchange gas at a pressure of @xmath05 mbar .",
    "the @xmath11 measurements were carried out at a temperature of 4.2k .",
    "the excitation sources were a semiconductor laser diode emitting at @xmath12 nm or a helium neon laser emitting at 632.8 nm .",
    "the laser was focused to a diffraction limited spot of about 0.8@xmath10 m in diameter .",
    "this diffraction limit of light of the confocal microscopy is also the limiting factor for the overall resolution of the correlation technique .",
    "typical excitation power densities were in the order of 10 - 50w/@xmath9 , orders of magnitude below the level where significant heating of the sample could be observed ( fig.[pltemheating ] ) .",
    "indeed , in contrast to similar experiments performed in a helium flow cryostat  @xcite , we did not observe any severe heating effects resulting from the low heat conductivity of the thin carbon membrane .",
    "in our case , we are able to realize @xmath11 measurements on nanowires dispersed to a free - standing carbon membrane without the need of adding supplementary layers on top to allow for thermal dissipation as it was realized in previous studies @xcite .",
    "only this configuration enables simultaneous high resolution tem and @xmath11 measurements on the same single nanowire .",
    "the position of the sample in the in the focal plane of the objective was verified by acquiring a confocal reflectivity image from the sample area .",

    "we start by presenting results in nanowires consisting of nearly 100% wurtzite . in this case , the direct correlation method is less important , as there is no significant variation on the structure along the nanowire .",
    "the correlation allows us to verify that the photoluminescence characteristics are correctly attributed to nanowires composed from wurtzite gaas .",
    "fig.[wz - neck - edx]a shows a high angle annular dark field ( haadf ) stem micrograph of several nanowires from the sample . in principle",
    "the haadf detector directly gives a contrast proportional to the atomic charge z of the nuclei in the sample .",
    "the contrast also depends on the sample thickness that is not uniform in the axial extension compared to the rest of the wire .",
    "the image contrast in fig.[wz - neck - edx]a therefore can not directly indicate the chemical composition .",
    "for this reason energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) was performed at the thin extension and the catalyst droplet to clearly determine the chemical composition .",
    "fig.[wz - neck - edx]b shows the edx spectrum taken with the electron beam focused at the tip of the nanowire .",
    "the spectral features clearly demonstrate the presence of the au catalyst . meanwhile",
    "fig.[wz - neck - edx]c shows that the thin extension of the nanowire towards the tip corresponds to axially grown algaas .",
    "this is in clear agreement with the picture that during the radial capping with the algaas / gaas shell the nanowire continues to grow axially from precipitation below the catalyst droplet .",
    "indeed for the case of au catalyzed nanowire the metallic catalyst is not affected by the growth conditions .",
    "we can therefore use the size of the nanowire neck to accurately estimate the size of the nanowire core .",
    "now we turn to the correlation between hrtem and spatial dependent pl . in fig.[wzcorrelation ] we have included tem micrographs representative of various locations along the nanowire . as shown at the left end",

    "the following @xmath14 of the nanowire ( c ) are stacking - fault free wurtzite gaas material .",
    "the final 250 nm ( d ) of the nanowire exhibits a mixture of heavily twinned zinc - blende and wurtzite phases .",
    "this can be attributed to the stage in which the conditions ( mainly as pressure ) were changed from axial to predominantly radial growth .",
    "region d corresponds to the remaining axial growth occurring during the capping and is composed of algaas as discussed before .",

    "1.515ev is observed throughout the length of the nanowire . by exciting the luminescence with an hene laser with a photon energy of 1.96ev",
    ", we have verified that there is no emission in the range of energies between 1.52 and 1.63ev .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous studies in which the luminescence in wurtzite / zinc - blende heterostructured nanowires was always observed below 1.515ev @xcite .",
    "furthermore this value is in agreement with recent theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "we have examined at least 4 nanowires with the same structural characteristics ( nearly 100% wurtzite ) and we did not observe any luminescence at the energies between 1.52 and 1.63ev . additionally , in order to rule out possible contamination of the nanowires , we have measured the pl of a @xmath14 thick gaas epilayer .",
    "the spectrum is shown in fig.[wzspectra ] the emission is peaked at 1.516ev , as expected for excitonic transitions in high purity gaas .",
    "the additional sharp peaks in the pl spectrum as well as the broad emission at 1.49ev can be attributed to carbon impurities . as a consequence",
    "we can conclude that our measurements are consistent with an interband transition in the wurtzite gaas at 1.515ev clearly originated in the core of the nanowire .",

    "the left side of the figure corresponds to the tip of the nanowire , which is in the zinc - blende phase with rotational twins separated by @xmath31 nm , shown in fig.[wzzbmappingcorr]b . from left to right ( towards the base of the nanowire ) , the density of deviations from an ideal zinc - blende crystal structure increases in a regular way .    within 6@xmath10 m from the left end of the nanowire these deviations",
    "are predominantly rotational twins and can be described considering a gradually increasing statistical twin density . for example , at positions 1@xmath10 m , 3@xmath10 m and 5@xmath10 m , we observe a twin density of 60 , 223 and 479  twins/@xmath10 m , respectively , shown in fig.[wzzbmappingcorr]c - d .",
    "this increase in the twin density is accompanied by a regular red - shift of the pl peak from 1.50 to 1.48ev .",
    "the pl signal is spatially discontinuous .    in the final third of the nanowire",
    "the concept of twin density is not sufficient to describe the structure of the nanowire , as segments of wurtzite phase appear regularly .",
    "we can describe considering the fraction of wurtzite phase present in the nanowire . at a distance of 6@xmath10 m from the tip",
    ", the highly dense twin lattice turns into an alternation of 2 to 5 nm thick zinc - blende and wurtzite sections . at that point ,",
    "the percentage of wurtzite is @xmath32 and the average spacing of each of the phases @xmath33 nm ( fig.[wzzbmappingcorr]e ) . moving forward towards the right , the percentage of wurtzite quickly increases up to 100% , approximately 400 nm before the bottom of the nanowire .",
    "some stacking faults and inclusions of zinc - blende smaller than 1 nm are observed right at the base , as shown in fig.[wzzbmappingcorr]f .",
    "a continuous wurtzite region of 290 nm is also found , shown in fig.[wzzbmappingcorr]g .",
    "this region is followed by a single 2.4 nm insertion of zinc - blende followed by 84 nm of wurtzite .",
    "exactly at the base , we find a 46 nm thick section with a mixture of wurtzite and zinc - blende .",
    "the gradual decrease of wurtzite fraction and twins is related to the increase in as@xmath3 pressure during the growth @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for the nanowire section where the twin density increases , the pl shifts from 1.51 down to 1.48ev . after this , consistent with the regions where wurtzite sections appear clearly , the pl peak shifts further down to 1.46ev . at the final section of the nanowire a blue - shift of the pl",
    "energy is observed .",
    "we never observe pl signal above 1.515ev .",
    "a total of four nanowires were investigated with the direct correlation method .",
    "they all showed a similar behavior .",
    "another example is shown in fig.[wzzbcorr2]a .",
    "the measurements presented above raise two main questions : + 1 ) in the top two thirds of the nanowire , why is the twinning density shifting the pl emission towards lower energies from 1.51 to 1.48ev ?",
    "+ 2 ) can one derive the values of the conduction and valence band discontinuity between wurtzite and zinc - blende from the correspondence between the tem and pl measurements ?    in order to address the first question ,",
    "we start by analyzing what seems to be a twin density dependence of the pl emission .",
    "indeed , we have observed a significant red - shift ( 40mev ) for a twin density varying from 50 to 500  twins/@xmath10 m .",
    "various causes may be responsible for this .",
    "for example , it is known that the binding energy of excitons confined in quantum well  like structures increases @xcite .",
    "however in gaas , even in the ideal 2d confinement limit , this could not account for a shift of more than @xmath012mev at most @xcite .",
    "it is known that a change of effective mass within the quantum well plane could further increase the exciton binding energies  @xcite .",
    "however the in - plane effective masses are not expected to change so significantly in wurtzite gaas  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the presumably type ii nature of the transition actually leads to a separation of electrons and holes thus diminishing the coulomb interaction between the carriers .",
    "moreover , a type ii superlattice of single wurtzite layers in zinc - blende with varying superlattice periodicity can not be an explanation because it would lead to a blue shift instead of a red shift .",
    "finally , we must consider the possible correlation between the twin density and the appearance of single structures with several consecutive twins , corresponding to thin sections of the wurtzite phase .",
    "the occurrence of one twin is often illustrated as one monolayer of wurtzite .",
    "multiple consecutive twinning leads to the formation of thicker wurtzite segments , which could account for the pl peaks below the gaas band gap .    for a relatively homogeneous twin density over a length of several hundreds of nm ,",
    "the twin density in that region gives directly the probability @xmath34 for a twinning event to occur during nucleation of a gaas atomic layer in the ( 111 ) direction : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cubic gaas lattice constant and @xmath37 is the density of twins in the region of the nanowire .",
    "assuming statistical independence of the twinning process  @xcite and the law of large numbers the probability of @xmath38 subsequent twinning events to occur is given by @xmath39 .",
    "we can therefore derive the average distance between such occasional segments consisting of @xmath38 consecutive twins .",
    "@xmath40    in order to reveal the existence of multiple twinning and formation of thin segments of wurtzite , we examined each of the hrtem micrographs along the nanowire .",
    "we found sections formed by @xmath41 monolayers ( ml ) of wurtzite in regions with increasing twin density .",
    "hrtem micrographs corresponding to @xmath17 and @xmath19 are shown in fig.[twindensity]a - b .",
    "the position of these sections corresponds to regions in the nanowire with high pl intensity . in fig.[twindensity]c",
    "we plot the pl peak position as a function of the twin density of the nanowire section .",
    "low temperature pl is very sensitive to the presence of such inhomogeneities with lower recombination energies .",
    "the majority of photogenerated carriers diffuse to the wurtzite quantum wells ( lower energy ) where they recombine .",
    "the line widths of the peaks are extremely sharp with a fwhm below 2.5mev , which further corroborates our explanation ( fig.[wzzbcorr2]b ) .",
    "we also plot the position of the peaks observed in positions where twin stacks with n between 1 and 4 are observed by hrtem .",
    "clearly , the redshift in the pl peaks is correlated with the existence of consecutive twins and the existence of 1 , 2 and 3 ml thick single wurtzite regions .    in the last third of the nanowire",
    ", segments of wurtzite appear regularly , as shown in fig.[wzzbmappingcorr]e . in the pl mapping ,",
    "multiple peaks are observed from 1.49 down to 1.455ev .",
    "the final part on the right end of the nanowire is composed of pure wurtzite gaas material segments with a length of up to 290 nm , see fig.[wzzbmappingcorr]f - g , with small insertions of the zinc - blende structure .",
    "this region shows again pl emission above 1.49ev . in order to address the question of whether the band offsets between wurtzite and zinc - blende gaas phases",

    "the horizontal error bars represent the microscopic variations of the actual nonperiodic heterostructure from an ideal homogeneous superlattice .",
    "peaks at 1.455ev correspond to regions of the nanowire exhibiting approximately 50:50 composition of the wurtzite and zinc - blende phases .",
    "peaks at energies higher than 1.455ev correspond to sections in the nanowire richer in one of the two phases .",
    "we point out that the highest energy pl peaks in the region with pure wurtzite correspond to a band gap of 1.504ev ; we never observed pl at energies above the free exciton of zinc - blende gaas .",
    "finally , we propose a model to explain the pl emission in the last third of the nanowire . to this end",

    "it is well known that this type of approach does not reproduce well the unoccupied part of the electronic spectrum and the energy band gap .",
    "recently , it was shown that both the band gap  @xcite and the excitation energies  @xcite are vastly improved by applying a screened hartree ",
    "fock hybrid exchange functional ( hse06 )  @xcite .",
    "however , such calculations due to their high computational cost can be performed only for selected high - symmetry points in the bz .",
    "our approach then consists of performing a full band - structure calculation with the lda method and using the hse06 results to correct the excited states , by applying a uniform shift equal to the band gap correction for the zinc - blende structure ; we are fully aware that such a `` scissor operator '' approach may not be adequate  @xcite , but for the bands of interest this approach gives very good results as explained below . for the hybrid exchange calculations we employed the pbe exchange - correlation functional in the dft part  @xcite and paw potentials to represent the ions  @xcite .",
    "we use a unit cell that has the same number of atoms in the zinc - blende and wurtzite lattices , by doubling one of the lattice vectors of the former , as shown in fig.[gaas - structures ] .",
    "we used plane - wave energy cutoffs of 326ev for the lda and 400ev for the hse06 calculations , and a reciprocal space monkhorst - pack grid of @xmath51 k - points  @xcite .",
    "we used the experimental in - plane lattice constant of zinc - blende ( 3.99 ) corresponding to bulk @xmath52 .",

    "the results of the calculations are collected in table[table : bands ] and the band structures for the zinc - blende and wurtzite phases are shown in fig.[gaas - bands ] , along the important directions , that is , [ 111 ] for zinc - blende and [ 0001 ] for wurtzite .",
    "we can calculate the band structure of this interface and assign each band to relevant wurtzite or zinc - blende phase , based on density distribution and similarity to bands of the bulk zinc - blende and wurtzite structure . in this way we can get information of band alignment / offsets of this interface .",
    "it is clear from the plot in fig.[gaas - bands ] that along these directions in reciprocal space the uniform shift of excited lda states ( open black circles ) by an amount equal to the band gap correction for the zinc - blende phase , brings them to excellent agreement with the calculated hse06 results ( filled red circles ) .",
    "the calculated band offsets are @xmath55mev and @xmath56mev , and effective masses along the [ 0001 ] wurtzite orientation are @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; the corresponding values for the [ 111 ] zinc - blende orientation are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the essential difference is in the electron effective mass , which comes from the folding of the bands along the [ 0001 ] wurtzite orientation , as seen in fig.[gaas - bands ] .",
    "the corresponding superlattice model curve using the calculated band offsets and wurtzite effective masses is shown in fig.[superlatt]b .",
    "our first principles calculations indicate that the band gap of wurtzite gaas is 21mev lower compared to the band gap of the zinc - blende phase are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "our experimentally determined band offsets are also in excellent agreement with band offsets recently calculated by de and pryor @xcite using an empirical pseudopotential method ( see table[table : bands ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented results on a new technique that enables the experimental direct correlation between confocal micro - photoluminescence measurements and the structural characterization with high resolution transmission electron microscopy of nanowires consisting of nearly 100% wurtzite and presenting wurtzite / zinc - blende polytypism .",
    "the observations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the band gap and band offsets between the wurtzite and zinc - blende phases of gaas . in wurtzite",
    "gaas nanowires , we observe photoluminescence always below 1.52ev . taking into account the electronic confinement ,",
    "the results indicate that the electronic band gap of wurtzite gaas phase is slightly smaller than zinc - blende gaas with an estimated @xmath61 .",
    "the results on the polytypic nanowires are multiple .",
    "first , we correlate the appearance of wurtzite sections with the probability of twin formation .",
    "then , we link the position of the luminescence with the stacking sequence of the wurtzite and zinc - blende phases . due to the fact that the actual nanowire heterostructure is non periodic , an exact calculation for the optical transitions would require a model including the complete stacking sequence of each nanowire with atomic precision ;",
    "it is extremely challenging to determine this sequence experimentally .",
    "using a more simple periodic superlattice model , we have demonstrated that the experimental findings can be well explained despite the drastic simplifications of the model ; we determine for the first time an experimental estimation for the band offsets of @xmath47mev and @xmath48mev .",
    "these band offsets correspond to a band gap for wurtzite gaas of approx .",
    "23mev lower compared to the band gap of the zinc - blende phase .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our results on pure wurtzite gaas nanowires , other experiments  @xcite , our first principles calculations and other recent band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a slightly smaller band gap of the wurtzite phase of gaas is supported by our general observation that even though both nanowire samples contain large amounts of wurtzite gaas , we have never observed pl emission above the band gap of zinc - blende gaas .    the authors thank g. abstreiter , t. garma , d. spirkoska and m. bichler for their experimental support and discussions .",
