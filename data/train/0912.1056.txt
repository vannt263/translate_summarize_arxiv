    "the bulk of the stars , gas and dust in the milky way are confined to its bulge and plane . as a result , in these directions , the extinction and crowding are high , making any study of the inner structure of the galaxy difficult . knowing how the stellar populations are distributed within the galaxy is essential for such studies and hence the main goal of the described survey .",
    "traditional distance indicators have been used with various success in the past .",
    "the approach was to concentrate on clear `` windows '' , where optical surveys can be carried out ( e.g. , macho , ogle , eros ) . in this paper",
    "we describe the vista variables in the via lactea ( vvv ) survey , an eso ( european southern observatory ) public near - ir variability survey .",
    "its area includes the milky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid - plane where star - formation activity is high .",
    "this survey will be conducted in the period @xmath0 and will map the whole bulge systematically for multiple epochs .",
    "we plan to cover a 520  deg@xmath2 area ( fig.[area ] ) containing @xmath3@xmath8 point sources . our survey will give the most complete catalogue of variable objects in the bulge , with more than @xmath3@xmath9 variables .",
    "chief among them are the rr  lyrae , which are accurate primary distance indicators , and well understood regarding their chemical , pulsational and evolutionary properties . for the sake of space and coherence we concentrate on the rr  lyrae and the star clusters , noting that similar studies can be done for many of the other populations of variable objects .",
    "earlier single - epoch near - ir surveys ( e.g. , cobe , 2mass , glimpse ) have proven that the galactic bulge is triaxial and boxy , and contains a bar @xcite .",
    "presently , the only model we have for the formation of boxy / barred bulges is through secular evolution of a pre - existing disk .",
    "this scenario is believed to be the dominant channel of formation of bulges in late - type spirals ( sbc ) , whereas early - type spiral bulges ( s0/sa ) show structural and kinematic evidence for an early , rapid collapse , which seems to be confirmed by the old age of their stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , the best - studied spiral bulge , that of the milky way , is precisely the most problematic one to understand in this context .",
    "while its surface brightness shows a barred structure , its stellar population is predominantely old @xcite and has @xmath10-element enhancement , characteristic of rapid formation .",
    "nevertheless , the high mean age of the bulge still leaves space for a small fraction of young stellar objects ( yso ) which have been found in the inner bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite which indicate that the chemical composition of the bulge stars is different from that of both thin and thick - disk stars .",
    "thus , the predictions from the formation of the milky way bulge through secular evolution of the disk seem to be in conflict with some key properties of its stellar population .",
    "however , @xcite recently published results that are in contradiction to @xcite and show that bulge and disk stars are indistinguishable in their chemical composition . given that the near - ir colours depend strongly on metallicity , the vvv survey will help us to investigate the metallicity distribution in the survey region .",
    "spectroscopic data ( e.g. , future apogee ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will provide additional @xmath10-element abundances .",
    "our survey of the rr  lyrae in the galactic bulge will allow us to map its 3-d structure ( as shown by * ? ? ? * ) and will provide key information on the age of its population , given that rr  lyrae stars are tracers of the old population ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this will enable us to combine the ages of the stellar populations with their spatial distributions .",
    "we note that most single - epoch surveys only provide 2-d maps . with the present survey",
    ", the peak and width of the rr  lyrae distribution is expected to be measured with an accuracy of better than @xmath11  mag , which is the required precision to determine the 3-d structure not only of the bulge , but also of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) located behind the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and included in our survey .    at the same time , a comparison between the rr  lyrae ( and type ii cepheids ) in the field and in globular clusters may hold precious information about the formation of the bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "modern @xmath12cdm cosmology predicts that large galaxies such as the milky way formed by accretion of hundreds of smaller `` protogalactic fragments '' , perhaps not unlike the progenitors of the present - day dwarf spheroidal satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , two very massive globular clusters in the galactic bulge , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , have recently been suggested to be the remnants of dwarf galaxies that were accreted in the course of the galaxy s history @xcite .",
    "these clusters might prove similar to the cases of m54 ( ngc  6715 ) , in the center of the sgr dsph , which is currently being cannibalised by the milky way @xcite , and of @xmath13  cen ( ngc  5139 ) , which has long been suspected to be the remnant nucleus of a dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "our proposed search for rr  lyrae and type ii cepheids in the galactic bulge will reveal the presence of debris related to the accretion events that might have left behind ngc  6441 as remnant object .",
    "the latter is part of our survey .    in order to understand the milky way s populations globally",
    ", it is necessary to survey the inner galactic plane as well .",
    "therefore , we will survey an adjacent region of the mid - plane and provide a legacy database and 3-d atlas of a large population i ( i.e. young and luminous stars ) region .",
    "we have selected the region @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see fig.[area ] ) , where star - formation activity is high and for which there will be complementary optical , mid - ir , and far - ir data from vphas@xmath16 , the spitzer , glimpse and mipsgal surveys , and from the all - sky akari and wise survey .",
    "the addition of this region will also permit us to discriminate between various models of the inner galactic structure which , besides the triaxial bulge , contain a long bar and a ring ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or not ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the selected region includes the putative negative - longitude tip of the long bar ( at @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , which has not yet been observed .",
    "the large survey area will allow several remaining astrophysical problems to be addressed .",
    "for example , the effect of the environment on star formation and in particular the initial mass function ( imf ) at low masses is presently poorly known .",
    "this issue will be addressed statistically by observing hundreds of star - forming regions and cross - correlating the shapes of their luminosity functions with cluster density , the presence of high - mass stars , and galactocentric distance . for comparison",
    ", vvv survey will reach @xmath19 deeper than ukidss galactic plane survey ( gps ) , which overlaps with vvv in the region of @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "other important parameters , such as velocity dispersion and metallicity , will be determined by spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "in addition , the luminosity function of the clusters themselves will be measured , for both star - forming clusters and more evolved open clusters .",
    "these issues can not be addressed with optical surveys , owing to the high extinction in the plane .",
    "the spitzer data will be invaluable for detecting the most obscured high - mass protostars within star - forming regions .",
    "a near - ir survey will be more sensitive to all but the reddest objects , and the superior spatial resolution in these wavebands will be essential for resolving distant clusters and the crowded field populations .",
    "the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) is a 4m - class `` wide - field '' telescope located at eso s cerro paranal observatory in chile , designed to conduct large - scale surveys of the southern sky at near - ir wavelengths ( 0.9 to 2.5  @xmath22 m ) .",
    "the telescope has an altitude - azimuth mount , and quasi ritchey - chrtien optics .",
    "an @xmath23 primary mirror was designed together with cassegrain - focus instrumentation to offer the best solution to the difficult problem of combining a wide - field with good image quality , and results in a physically large focal plane with an @xmath24 focus @xcite .",
    "vista s active optics uses two low - order curvature sensors , which operate concurrently with science exposures , and a high - order curvature sensor .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a near - ir camera containing 67 million pixels ( an array of @xmath25 raytheon virgo ir detectors ) of mean size @xmath26 and available broad - band filters at @xmath27 and a narrow - band filter at 1.18 @xmath22 m . given vista s nominal pixel size ,",
    "the diameter of the field of view is 1.65  deg .",
    "the point - spread function ( psf ) of the telescope+camera system ( including pixels ) is designed to have a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath28 , not including the contribution of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "seeing , and other weather - related statistics for cerro paranal , are given at eso s `` astroclimatology of paranal '' web pages .",
    "the vista site is expected to have similar conditions , which are well suited to our survey requirements .",
    "the 16 detectors in the camera are not buttable and are arranged as shown in figure[camera ] .",
    "each individual exposure produces a sparsely sampled image of the sky known as a `` pawprint '' , covering an area of 0.599  deg@xmath2 .",
    "to ` fill in ' the gaps between the detectors to produce a single filled `` tile '' with reasonably uniform sky coverage , the minimum number of pointed observations ( with fixed offsets ) required is six ( three offsets in @xmath29 and two offsets in @xmath30 ) .",

    "<S> we describe the public eso near - ir variability survey ( vvv ) scanning the milky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid - plane where star formation activity is high . </S>",
    "<S> the survey will take 1929  hours of observations with the 4-metre vista telescope during five years ( @xmath0 ) , covering @xmath1 point sources across an area of 520  deg@xmath2 , including 33 known globular clusters and @xmath3@xmath4 open clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the final product will be a deep near - ir atlas in five passbands ( @xmath5 m ) and a catalogue of more than @xmath6 variable point sources . unlike single - epoch surveys that , in most cases , only produce 2-d maps </S>",
    "<S> , the vvv variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-d map of the surveyed region using well - understood distance indicators such as rr  lyrae stars , and cepheids . </S>",
    "<S> it will yield important information on the ages of the populations . </S>",
    "<S> the observations will be combined with data from macho , ogle , eros , vst , spitzer , hst , chandra , integral , wise , fermi lat , xmm - newton , gaia and alma for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the inner milky way . </S>",
    "<S> this public survey will provide data available to the whole community and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the milky way , its globular cluster evolution , and the population census of the galactic bulge and center , as well as the investigations of the star forming regions in the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the combined variable star catalogues will have important implications for theoretical investigations of pulsation properties of stars .    _ </S>",
