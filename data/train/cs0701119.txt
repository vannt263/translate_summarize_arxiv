    "a set of engineering problems are concerned with aggregates simulation . as a rule models of every part of aggregate are simple",
    ". however model of whole aggregate may be very complicated .",
    "that is the purpose to which the framework has been developed .",
    "you can download source code and evaluate examples from http://www.genetibase.com/universal-engineering-framework-9.php .",
    "it is worth to note that typical engineering problems have many aspects that lay outside pure mechanics .",
    "therefore this framework is a part of the universal engineering framework http://www.genetibase.com/universal-engineering-framework-1.php , that enables us to simulate complicated engineering phenomena .",
    "described framework has a simple background .",
    "there exists a set of connected parts of aggregates .",
    "if we have two parts connected at the point @xmath0 then linear @xmath1 and an angular @xmath2 accelerations of one part at point @xmath0 coincides with corresponding accelerations of the .",
    "if one part acts on another one with force @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 then the second part acts to first one with force @xmath5 and momentum @xmath6 .",
    "this is set of conditions is sufficient for construction of aggregate equations .",
    "let us consider that aggregate contains @xmath7 parts numbered by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a set of such pairs @xmath10 that @xmath11-th part is connected to @xmath12- th one .",
    "we shall consider only the case when the graph corresponding to @xmath9 @xcite is a forest @xcite . according to lagrangian mechanics @xcite vector @xmath13 of generalized coordinates @xcite of @xmath11 -th part satifies to the following ordinary differential equation :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a part s",
    "specific term and @xmath16 is a generalized force .",
    "we can decompose generalized force in the following way :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is an external force and @xmath19 is generalized force caused by action of part @xmath12 to part @xmath11 .",
    "let us denote vector @xmath20 as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are ordinary force and momentum of action of @xmath12 - th part to @xmath11 - th one .",
    "then we have    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is a connection specific matrix .",
    "let us denote vector @xmath26 as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are linear and angular acceleration at the place of connection between @xmath11 - th and @xmath12 - th part .",
    "then @xmath30    using previous equations we can obtain a system of linear equations whose variables are vectors @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 . resolving of these equations give as @xmath31 and full system of differential equation of aggregate . note that if we use numerical methods to solve such equations we should the latter should be normalized .",
    "it means that we should make such corrections to generalized coordinates that coordinates and velocities in @xmath11 - th and @xmath12 - th part s connection point should be equal for all @xmath35 .",
    "all equations of previous section are elementary exercises for first year engineering student .",
    "the main advantage of this work is its program implementation .",
    "this advantage may be exhibited by the following example .",
    "let us consider a spacecraft with two nonrigid photovoltaics and three flywheels ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this example contains spacecraft with 5 connections * c 1 * , ... , * c 5*. flywheels * f 1 * , * f 2 * , * f 3 * and photovoltaics * p 1 * , * p 2 * , * p 3 * are connected to the spacecraft .",
    "we can obtain full mechanical model of the spacecraft at once using designer ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the idea of software is very simple .",
    "all mechanical objects should implement interface @xcite _ iaggregablemechanicalobject_. you can download source code of this interface from http://www.genetibase.com/universal-engineering-framework-9.php .",
    "then designer enables us to construct full models of aggregates from objects those implement this interface .",
    "now three types of mechanical objects are implemented .",
    "you can develop your own type of object . to do this",
    "you should implement _ iaggregablemechanicalobject _ interface .",
    "let us consider types of implemented objects .",
    "rigid body is a simplest object of 6d dynamics .",
    "it is characterized by mass and moment of inertia .",
    "key properties of our rigid body implementation are places of connections .",
    "connections are defined by those coordinates and orientation .",
    "you can define those coordinates @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and components @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 of quaternions of orientation .",
    "flywheel has general properties of rigid body and additional ones .",
    "additional properties of flywheel include a moment of inertia of a wheel , initial angular velocity of a wheel and a moment that acts to wheel .",
    "elastic vibrations body is a mechanical system of infinite degree of freedom .",
    "usually math model of this object contains finite degree of freedom with finite set of valuable harmonic oscillations .",
    "every harmonic oscillation may be described by following second order ordinary differential equation : @xmath43 where @xmath13 is a generalized coordinate and @xmath44 is a corresponding generalized force .",
    "let us consider the following example .",
    "we have a spacecraft ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "currents of its equipment interact with earth s magnetic field .",
    "spacecraft has a photovoltaic that is an elastic vibrations body .",
    "the is a flywheel that is used for angular stabilization of the spacecraft . using the designer we may simulate this situation in the way represented at figure 4 .",
    "let us briefly explain this situation .",
    "first of all we setup * coordinates of spacecraft*. we need them for definition of gravitational acceleration and magnetic field .",
    "then we construct * magnetic field * by formulas .",
    "it is convenient to represent magnetic field with a vector .",
    "therefore we ve used * field vector*. its usage enables us to define mechanical moment as a vector product of magnetic induction and magnetic moment of spacecraft : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is magnetic dipole momentum of spacecraft and @xmath47 is vector of magnetic induction of th earth . vector product operation is supported by formula editor embedded into framework .",
    "the * gravity * component is used for simulation of gravitational accelerations . using above components",
    "we have defined inertial accelerations and mechanical moments .",
    "now let us constuct control system .",
    "its first element is a sensor .",
    "we will use a sensor of local vertical . to do this",
    "we define * spacecraft frame * and * earth s center frame*. * relative position * ( 6d ) enables us to simulate the sensor of local vertical .",
    "the * control law * uses it . and at last moment of * flywheel",
    "* is calculated by the * control law*. you can download this example from http://www.genetibase.com/universal-engineering-framework-9.php and evaluate it .",
    "this framewok is very useful for simulation of complicated phenomena that include mechanical ones .",
    "authors of this article think that present - day engineering software should ( potentialy ) include all kinds of physical phenomenons .",
    "authors would like to aknowldge the genetibase company that kindly sited source code and examples on their site ."
