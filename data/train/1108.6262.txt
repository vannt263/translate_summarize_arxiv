    "our recent publication @xcite introduces a new type of rayleigh - benard turbulent convection , namely symmetric non - oberbeck - boussinesq ( snob ) turbulent convection .",
    "the latter is characterized by strong temperature and density dependencies of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of a supercritical fluid near its gas - liquid critical point ( cp ) at the average critical density of the fluid in the cell .",
    "this strong temperature and density dependence results in a strong but symmetric height dependence of the main physical properties , which enter into the expressions for the control parameters of turbulent convection .",
    "so , in spite of strong variations of the fluid properties across the cell height , up - down symmetry of the temperature drops across the top and bottom halves of the cell and of the top and bottom thermal boundary layer widths is preserved .",
    "thus , it was shown @xcite that in this case the same scaling of @xmath3 with the rayleigh number , @xmath4 , as in the oberbeck - boussinesq ( ob ) turbulent convection is preserved but a much stronger the prandtl number , @xmath5 , dependence of @xmath6 is found . here @xmath7 is the gravity acceleration , @xmath8 is the fluid isobaric thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the fluid kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity , respectively , @xmath11 describes the heat transport by turbulent convection , @xmath12 is the heat flux density , @xmath13 is the the cell height , @xmath14 is the thermal conductivity of the fluid , @xmath15 is the temperature difference across the cell , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the temperatures of the bottom and top plates , respectively . in order to single out the influence of the non - ob effect on the heat transport , the heat transport experiments we repeated for each @xmath2 with an eight - fold larger non - ob effect by decreasing the cell height at the same @xmath1 . as the result , the @xmath3 scaling was not altered .",
    "therefore , the conclusion has been made that the strong snob effect by itself is not responsible for the strong @xmath2 dependence of the heat transport near cp observed in the experiment but , probably , strongly enhanced compressibility , which accompanies an increase of @xmath2 due to approach to cp , could cause the observed @xmath2 dependence .",
    "next natural question arises whether the snob effect results in the same scaling relations as in the ob case for statistics of temperature and velocity fields . in our early papers @xcite , we have already studied the statistics , frequency power spectra and scaling of velocity and temperature fields .",
    "however , this old experiment was less controlled and had lower resolution in temperature measurements with a narrower range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 than in the current experiment .",
    "the goal of the experiments presented in this paper is to find out whether the snob effect in turbulent convection modifies the scaling properties of the characteristic frequencies , corresponding to large scale circulation , to the bolgiano length and to the dissipation scale , of the temperature power spectra and correlation functions , and the scaling properties of the structure functions of the temperature increments compared with the ob case .",
    "these statistical properties of the temperature field are studied in a wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , the same as was reported in our recent paper on the heat transport @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii the experimental setup is described in details . in section",
    "iii the local temperature measurements and statistics of temperature filed are presented .",
    "frequency spectra of temperature fluctuations and auto- and cross - correlation functions of temperature field are discussed in section iv , and temperature structure functions at high values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are shown in section v. the results are summarized and discussed in section vi .",
    "as convecting fluid , high purity ( 99.998% ) gaseous sulfurhexafluoride @xmath0 was used in the single - phase region in the vicinity of the gas - liquid critical temperature @xmath18 and at the critical density @xmath19 . this fluid",
    "was chosen due to its relatively low @xmath18 and critical pressure @xmath20 , and its well - known thermodynamic and kinetic properties , both far away and in the close vicinity of the cp .",
    "the region of the phase diagram exploited in our experiment is located at @xmath21 and in the region of the reduced mid - plane temperature , @xmath22 , between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . as we pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , nist @xcite gives the following values for the critical parameters : @xmath25  k , @xmath26  bars , @xmath27  kg / m@xmath28 , which we further use in our analysis . in ref .",
    "@xcite we provided detail information about thermodynamic and kinetic properties of @xmath29 in the region of our interest and the way of temperature and pressure calibration and determination of the critical density @xmath30 .",
    "the experiments were carried out in two cells : one cell of a square cross section @xmath31 mm@xmath32 and height @xmath33 mm ( aspect ratio @xmath34 ) , and one cylindrical cell with diameter @xmath35 mm and height @xmath33 mm ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the side walls of all cells were made of 4  mm thick plexiglass ( @xmath37  w / m  k ) .",
    "the cells were enclosed into a high - pressure stainless steel vessel .",
    "the interior of the cell communicated with the gap between cell and pressure vessel , through a small hole of about 1 mm located in the cell mid - plane . for the cylindrical cell ,",
    "this gap was narrower than 5 mm and tightly filled with glass wool ( @xmath38  w / m  k ) , tightened by a band .",
    "the cell was then inserted into the vessel with a sufficient force . in the square cross section cells ,",
    "the outer space was larger , but also tightly packed with glass wool . in both cases",
    "the filler was used to reduce the amount of gas surrounding the cell , in order to prevent convection outside the cell and to reduce the heat transfer due to the outer gas ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in the rectangular cell , a top plate made of @xmath39  mm thick stainless steel 304 ( @xmath40  w / m  k ) and bottom plate made of @xmath41  mm thick aluminium 7075 (",
    "@xmath42  w / m  k ) were used . in the cylindrical cell ,",
    "copper plates for both top and bottom were used .",
    "heat was supplied at the cell bottom by a metal - film heater of resistance 100  @xmath43 , that covered uniformly the entire active area of the bottom plate .",
    "the experiment was carried out at a constant heat flux , which was measured during the experiment .",
    "the high - pressure vessel itself was immersed into a water bath .",
    "the top plate was cooled down by water circulating in a two loop temperature controlled system .",
    "the first water loop was refrigerated by a circulator ( lauda inc . ) with a temperature stability of @xmath44  mk .",
    "the second water circuit , coupled via a heat exchanger to the first one , cooled down the pressure vessel .",
    "the water temperature in the second loop was controlled by a heater located just before the inlet to the apparatus , computer - controlled by a feedback loop using a thermistor placed in the mixing chamber of the water bath .",
    "the entire apparatus was covered with insulating polyuretane sheets to reduce thermal losses .",
    "the temperature stability of the bath achieved in a such way was better than @xmath45 mk rms . all heat transfer and temperature measurements were carried out at fixed volume of the gas at the critical density . to perform the local temperature measurements , first the average temperature of the water bath ,",
    "@xmath46 was adjusted above @xmath18 . the bottom temperature in the cell , @xmath47",
    "was then increased and @xmath46 decreased in a such way that the temperature in the cell mid - plane @xmath48 remained constant .",
    "this way , the value of @xmath2 at the cell midplane also remained constant with an accuracy better than 1% for a given temperature difference @xmath49 across the cell or for a given @xmath1 .",
    "each time , the value of @xmath50 was recalculated from @xmath46 and compared with the temperature measured by the thermistor glued on the surface of the top plate .",
    "temperature measurements inside the cell were conducted using several thermistors and one platinum thermometer of 1  @xmath51 resistance .",
    "the latter provided the thermodynamic scale which defines the critical parameters of the fluid , entering in either the parametric equation of state @xcite or the tabulated data from nist @xcite .",
    "two glass - embedded stable thermistors p20bb204 m from thermometrics inc . were used in the water bath and inside the bottom plate .",
    "three glass bead thermistors b05kb204 m of @xmath52  @xmath53 m diameter from thermometrics inc . were used to measure temperature inside the cell : one was glued close to the center of the top plate and two were mounted on the vertical motor - driven probe at the cell center .",
    "all thermistors together with the resistance thermometer were calibrated in the thermally - regulated water bath ( with a temperature stability of @xmath44  mk ) against the secondary standard platinum - resistance thermometer of 1  @xmath51 from the russian institute of standards .",
    "this thermometer was supplied with a calibration accurate to @xmath44  mk , on the its90 temperature scale .",
    "long - term stability ( during 10 hours ) of the thermistors was better than 0.1 mk .",
    "pressure was measured with a calibrated pressure transducer tje/727 - 23 ( 0 - 1000 psi ) from sensotec inc . with a full scale output of 4.9975  v , which was read by a 6.5 digits multimeter .",
    "the pressure transducer was calibrated against the absolute high precision pressure gauge heise inc , usa ( 100.00 bar ) with accuracy @xmath54  mbar in the whole range .",
    "long - term stability ( during 10 hours ) of the pressure transducer was better than 0.1 mbar .",
    "the determination of the critical density of @xmath0 , which is crucial for the experiment near cp on the critical isochore , was based on the equation of state @xcite and on the nist data @xcite .",
    "we adjusted the gas density far away from cp but in the region still covered by the equation of state and the nist data @xcite , by variation of t and p and their precise measurements to be equal to @xmath19 according to either the equation of state or the nist data @xcite .",
    "this method has an error in @xmath19 due to the errors in t and p of the order of @xmath55 , while the accuracy in determination of @xmath18 and @xmath20 via the equation of state was completely defined by the errors in the absolute values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "local temperature measurements inside the cell were conducted by two glass - bead thermistors b05kb204 m of @xmath52  @xmath53 m diameter and fast response time of 5 msec ( immersed in water ) from thermometrics inc .",
    ", mounted on a stainless steel capillary tube of 0.8 mm outer diameter , separated vertically by a fixed distance of about half of the cell height ( about 45 mm ) .",
    "each thermistor is mounted on the copper leads of 0.1 mm diameter and 5 mm long and suspended on its contacting leads of 0.02 mm diameter and about 5 mm long , made of platinum alloy ( @xmath58 w / m k ) ( fig .",
    "the probe was driven vertically by a computer - controlled stepping motor at the cell center in both cylindrical and rectangular cells , allowing precise computer control of the thermistor positions .",
    "besides in the rectangular cell another probe was used at one of the cell corners .",
    "temperature of the thermistors on the probe was measured in two ways .",
    "one way was the resistance measurements via an ac bridge and lock - in amplifier ( par model 124 ) at 83 hz and a - to - d card .",
    "the frequency was chosen to be about twice larger than the expected highest frequency in the temperature frequency spectra at the highest values of @xmath59 , that is about 30 - 40 hz .",
    "another way was the thermistor resistance measurements via a 6.5 digits multimeter keithley 2010 with a sampling rate of 54 hz .",
    "the comparison showed a good agreement between two data sets measured by two techniques . at each value of @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 the temperature measurements were taken at up to 30 locations but the data only at three heights are presented in details : 10 , 22.5 and 45 ( center ) mm with large statistics in average up to @xmath60 data points for each set . in the cylindrical cell ,",
    "the data for 6 different @xmath61 and up to 5 values of @xmath1 for each @xmath2 value were taken .",
    "so all together 66 data sets for different values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and 3 locations ( 10 , 22.5 and 45 mm ) for each set of @xmath62 were analyzed . in the rectangular cell , the data only for 3 values of @xmath63 and 5 values of @xmath1 for each @xmath2 and for the same three locations as above were analyzed .",

    "@xmath65 is the time average temperature .",
    "it can be seen that positive and negative spikes are distributed approximately equally .",
    "it is naturally reflected in almost symmetrical probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of temperature fluctuations at the central location in the both geometry cells with exponential tails taken at the same values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as in fig .",
    "3 ) . to compare pdfs at different heights at the cell center , we present pdfs of temperature fluctuations at several values of @xmath2 and selected values of @xmath1 in the both cylindrical and rectangular cells in fig .",
    "4 . as one expects , out of the mid - height pdfs show significant skewness and exponential tails , as a rule , in the direction of positive temperature fluctuations .",
    "the rms temperature fluctuations normalized by the temperature difference across the cell , @xmath66 , and measured at the cell mid - height as a function of @xmath1 at different values of @xmath2 are shown in fig .",
    "the data are fitted by the power law @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence is much stronger than @xmath70 found in the ob case @xcite while the @xmath2 dependence was never reported .",
    "the third @xmath71 and fourth @xmath72 moments of the temperature distributions at the cell mid - height as a function of @xmath1 for different @xmath2 are presented in fig .",
    "significant scatter between zero and unity is observed at @xmath71 and between 3 and 4 for @xmath72 without visible dependence on either @xmath1 or @xmath2 that witnesses on systematic deviations from the gaussian and almost symmetrical distribution .",
    "figure 7a , b , c shows a dependence of three moments of pdfs of temperature fluctuations on height @xmath73 at @xmath74 and three values of @xmath1 : @xmath75 .",
    "the normalized rms @xmath76 is independent of @xmath73 at @xmath74 and three values of @xmath1 as presented in fig .",
    "the same conclusion can be made for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 explored in the experiment .",
    "the skewness ( third moment ) @xmath71 and flatness ( fourth moment ) @xmath72 show positive deviations towards 1 and 4 , respectively , at the top and bottom of the cell , as one can see in fig .",
    "7b , c for @xmath74 and three values of @xmath1 .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 explored in the experiment .",
    "further by using frequency power spectra and auto- and cross - correlation functions of temperature fluctuations we are going to study scaling of the frequency of the large scale temperature oscillations with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these frequency peaks in the power spectra and the corresponding characteristic oscillation periods in the correlation functions were reported in many studies on ob turbulent convection @xcite .",
    "we concentrate first on the temperature measurements at the center and the mid - height of the cell in a wide range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as an example , we present in fig .",
    "8 the frequency power spectra of temperature @xmath77 at @xmath78 and 3 values of @xmath79 and at @xmath80 mm in the cylindrical cell .",
    "a striking feature of all frequency power spectra studied is an emergence of either one ( in a rectangular cell one observes either one main peak or the main peak and a much smaller second harmonic peak ) or two sharp peaks at low frequencies .",
    "the presence of the second harmonic peak at @xmath81 , besides the main peak at @xmath82 , indicates a nonlinear nature of the oscillations .",
    "the second peak can be comparable and sometime even larger ( in cylindrical cell ) than the main one ( see fig",
    ". 8) . in our early measurements ,",
    "the main peak in the frequency power spectra for temperature fluctuations was barely observed , probably , due to lower resolution and smaller statistics , whereas similar peaks in the frequency power spectra of velocity fluctuations were detected and analyzed @xcite .",
    "the normalized main peak frequencies for both cells at all values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 at @xmath80 mm are scaled as @xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "9 ) with the coefficient found from the high resolution compensating plot , which is presented in the inset in fig . 9 ( we used the value @xmath84 @xmath85/s , see ref .",
    "good agreement with the result on scaling of the frequency of the oscillations found from the peak in the velocity power spectra reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is found .",
    "similar scaling relations were obtained for the main peak @xmath86 in the frequency power spectra at the cell center and other two heights below the cell mid - plane @xmath87 and @xmath88 mm in the same range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . as shown in fig .",
    "10 a , b , the corresponding scaling relations are @xmath89 and @xmath90 at @xmath87 and @xmath88 mm , respectively , with close values of exponents for all three heights .",
    "figure 11 shows an independence of @xmath91 on the height at @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as examples .",
    "similar information can be found from the temperature auto - correlation function ( acf ) @xmath94 as a function of the delay time @xmath95 .",
    "here @xmath64 is the temperature fluctuation and @xmath65 is the average local temperature .",
    "figure 12 presents several examples of the measured acf at @xmath80 mm and at the following values of ( @xmath62 ) : ( @xmath96 ) , ( @xmath97 ) , and ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "first , the measured acf exhibit decaying oscillations .",
    "second , the characteristic oscillation period @xmath99 strongly depends on @xmath2 and @xmath1 . and third , the characteristic oscillation period @xmath99 is equal to the inverse frequency @xmath82 of the main peak in the corresponding power spectrum , and the exponents in the scaling relations of @xmath100 and @xmath91 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the same inside the error bars .",
    "similar features are also observed in the temperature cross - correlation function ( ccf ) @xmath101 as a function of @xmath95 . in the measurements ,",
    "the two thermistors separated by a fixed distance of 45 mm apart are located on the same vertical temperature probe , which is driven vertically at the cell center .",
    "figure 13 presents ccf at one location @xmath87 mm of the lower thermistor ( and correspondingly of the upper one at @xmath102 mm ) and at three values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 : ( @xmath103 ) , ( @xmath104 ) , ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "similar to the auto - correlation functions , ccfs exhibit oscillations with the frequency @xmath106 equal to the main peak frequency @xmath82 in the corresponding power spectrum .",
    "the oscillations have a decay with the coherence time @xmath107 , which is defined from the fit and is about an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding oscillation period @xmath99 . scaling relation of the normalized oscillation frequency @xmath106 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , found from the cross - correlation functions at @xmath87 mm",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "the power - law fit gives @xmath108 with the exponent values in a good agreement with those found for the main frequency peak in the power spectra ( see fig .",
    "we were not able to get the scaling relation for the coherence frequency @xmath109 due to large scatter and insufficient number of the data points .",
    "on the other hand , one finds that the ratio @xmath110 grows from approximately 3.5 at @xmath111 and @xmath112 till 4.5 at @xmath113 and @xmath114 and up to 8.8 at @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it means that the growing number of the observed oscillation periods during the decay period indicates the growing coherence of the oscillation of the large scale circulation . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the large scale circulation occurs before the threshold for the coherent oscillations .",
    "there is a threshold for the onset of the coherent oscillations , which are resulted from coherent action of the rising and falling plumes @xcite .",
    "thus , our measurements show that the threshold value of @xmath1 for the onset of the coherent oscillations also depends on @xmath2 .",
    "another feature of the cross - correlation function is the time delay ( shift ) @xmath117 of its peak value from zero .",
    "examples of the time delays are shown in fig .",
    "15 a , b for @xmath118 and three values of @xmath1 and for @xmath74 and another three values of @xmath1 .",
    "this time delay is probably related to the large scale circulation , and so can supply information about its velocity .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 dependence of the normalized time delay is presented in fig .",
    "16 , where the corresponding scaling relation is @xmath119 with the coefficient determined from the high resolution compensating plot ( see inset in fig .",
    "relatively large scatter of the data , compared for example with the data in figs .",
    "9 , 10 , and 14 , which is reflected in large error in the constant , could be probably the reason for the smaller value of the exponent in @xmath1 dependence 0.34 , compared with that obtained for the normalized oscillation frequency @xmath120 of the cross - correlation functions 0.41 ( see fig .",
    "14 and the corresponding scaling relation above ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the large scale circulation velocity and the oscillation frequency are related to each other by simple relation , which in frequency domain gives the ratio 4 . due to different scaling exponents for @xmath1 dependence mentioned above",
    ", the ratio between @xmath121 and @xmath106 varies between 1.3 and 2.2 , which difference from 4 can also be caused by the large scatter and insufficient statistics .    to further examine the scaling properties of the frequency power spectra of temperature fluctuations we use the method introduced for hydrodynamic turbulence and suggested for convective turbulence in ref .",
    "the method utilizes the peak frequency @xmath122 corresponding to the maximum value of the temperature dissipation spectra @xmath123 as the characteristic frequency to collapse the power spectra for different @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure 17 shows scaled frequency power spectra of temperature fluctuations @xmath124 versus @xmath125 for all values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 explored in the experiment in the cylindrical cell .",
    "an example of the dissipation spectrum @xmath123 at @xmath118 and @xmath126 at the height @xmath80 mm and the cell center is presented in fig .",
    "18 . the solid line in fig .",
    "18 is the sixth - order polynomial fit to the data , which allows an accurate determination of the frequency @xmath122 corresponding to the data maximum .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "17 , that for each @xmath2 and @xmath1 there is well - defined @xmath122 , with respect to which the frequency power spectrum is a universal function .",
    "thus , we checked that the suggested method @xcite works well in a wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 up to their very high values . to compare the scaling results for @xmath82 and @xmath122 , we present in fig . 19 the normalized frequency @xmath127 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding scaling relation is @xmath128 with the coefficient obtained from the compensating plot shown in the inset in fig .",
    "thus we found experimentally two characteristic frequencies , @xmath82 and @xmath122 in statistics and dynamics of the temperature field and studied their scaling relations in regards to the two control parameters of the problem @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the scaled frequency power spectra of the temperature fluctuations exhibit rather clear power - law region in the low frequency end with the exponent @xmath129 equal to the bolgiano - obukhov ( bo ) scaling though in the wave number domain that is more convincingly demonstrated by the high resolution compensating plot of @xmath130 versus @xmath125 in the inset in fig . 17 .",
    "this is the only clearly identified scaling region found in the scaled power spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "it is rather well established @xcite , that in developed turbulent convection at large values of @xmath1 and sufficiently small @xmath2 , two scaling regions can be observed simultaneously .",
    "one of them is the bo region , where buoyancy controls the dynamics , and another is the inertial , kolmogorov range , in which the effects of buoyancy are irrelevant @xcite .",
    "these regions are separated in scale by the bolgiano length scale @xmath131 , and at scales @xmath132 the bo scaling is observed , while at @xmath133 the kolmogorov scaling is found @xcite . according to @xcite , @xmath131 can be estimated by    @xmath134    and can be considered as a characteristic value of @xmath131 . using the expression of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we can estimate the characteristic bolgiano frequency based on large scale circulation velocity defined via @xmath82 .",
    "then the bolgiano frequency can be written in the normalized form as    @xmath135    where @xmath136 , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , is substituted into the expression of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and the expression for @xmath82 is used from the fit in fig .",
    "we point out that in the case considered the scaling of @xmath137 in both @xmath2 and @xmath1 is very different from the above found scaling for @xmath122 in contrast to ref .",
    "the ratio @xmath138 change rather strongly with @xmath1 but practically independent of @xmath2 in the range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 considered in the experiment . finally , the largest characteristic frequency in the temperature power spectra is the dissipation one defined from the dissipation ( or kolmogorov ) length @xcite    @xmath139    with @xmath6 substituted from ref .",
    "the corresponding dissipation frequency is @xmath140 . in fig .",
    "17 we show by arrows for comparison the minimal and maximal values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 for some specified values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 in the whole range of these parameters studied , while @xmath143 remains outside of frequency range presented in the plot at all values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . from our estimates",
    "one finds that @xmath137 is located rather close to the intersect of @xmath77 with the noise floor and therefore rather close to the cut - off frequency of the frequency power spectra for the most of the values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 considered in the experiment . only for the lowest values of @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    "one can expect to find @xmath137 close to @xmath122 ( see fig .",
    "17 ) . to conclude",
    ", the experimental results for @xmath82 and @xmath122 and the theoretical estimates for @xmath137 and @xmath144 in the range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 considered in the experiment give the following range of changes for these characteristic frequencies : @xmath145 $ ] hz , @xmath146 $ ] hz , @xmath147 $ ] hz , and @xmath148 $ ] hz .",
    "so , @xmath144 is out of scale of the power spectra obtained in the entire range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , where the cut - off frequency is exclusively determined by the noise floor , and @xmath137 for low @xmath2 and low @xmath1 probably could be found at frequencies significantly above the intersection with the noise floor .",
    "to proceed further with the analysis of an experimental determination of @xmath137 and probable existence of the mentioned above two scaling regions we use a different approach based on temperature structure functions .",
    "according to the values of @xmath82 and @xmath122 obtained experimentally and the values of @xmath137 obtained from estimates , one can expect at some values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 from the range of the values explored in the experiment to find @xmath137 rather close to @xmath122 , between @xmath82 and the cut - off frequency , and therefore to observe the second scaling region at @xmath149 corresponding to the kolmogorov scaling . as was shown in the recent publications @xcite , a generalized extended self - similarity ( ess ) method based on structure functions of temperature increments",
