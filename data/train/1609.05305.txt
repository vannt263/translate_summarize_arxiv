    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) are stars escaping the milky way ( mw ) gravitational well . whereas @xcite predicted theoretically their existence , hvss were observed for the first time only @xmath0 years later by @xcite . about @xmath1 hvss",
    "have been found at velocities up to @xmath2 km s@xmath3 in the outer mw halo ( between @xmath4 and @xmath5 kpc ) by the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "this survey targets stars with magnitudes and colors typical of @xmath6 late b - type stars . as consequence of the target strategy",
    ", the mmt stars could be either main sequence b stars , evolved blue horizontal branch stars or blue stragglers @xcite .",
    "recently , astronomers have started to investigate low - mass hvs candidates @xcite .",
    "being a mmt spectroscopic survey , hvs data suffer from the lack of tangential velocity measurements . the astrometric european satellite _",
    "( http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia ) is expected to measure proper motions with an unprecedented precision , providing a larger and less biased sample of hvss ( allegedly @xmath7 in a catalogue of @xmath8 stars ) . moreover , _ gaia _",
    "s sensitivity is good enough to search for multi - planet systems around massive stars and to reveal their architectures and three - dimensional orbits , giving the possibility of spotting some planetary transits around hvss @xcite .",
    "the hills mechanism @xcite involves the tidal breakup of a binary that passes close to the milky way black hole ( bh ) @xcite , but the physical mechanism responsible for the production of the observed hvss is still debated .",
    "other possible origins have been advanced @xcite , such as the interaction of a bh binary with a single star @xcite , the interaction of star clusters and bhs @xcite , supernova explosions @xcite and the dynamical evolution of a thin and eccentric disk orbiting around a bh @xcite .",
    "the extreme velocities of hvss indicate they may derive from a strong dynamical interaction with bhs in the galactic center ( gc ) or in a nearby galaxy @xcite .",
    "the importance of hvss is that they can provide information on the environment where they were born @xcite . in particular",
    ", they can discriminate between a single and a binary bh in the gc @xcite . since their orbits are determined by the mw potential ,",
    "hvs kinematics can be used to probe the galactic potential s triaxiality @xcite and discriminate among different galactic mass distributions @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate a possible origin of hvss which involves a young star cluster ( ysc ) that , during its orbit , has had the chance to pass close to the mw central super massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "when the ysc passes by the smbh , some of its stars can be stripped from the cluster and ejected with high velocities @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the method we use to study the consequences of ysc - bh interaction . in section 3 ,",
    "the results are presented and discussed . finally ,",
    "in section 4 , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we use the publicly available code mcluster to generate initial conditions for the ysc @xcite .",
    "mcluster sets up initial conditions once the desired features of the cluster are specified , such as the total mass @xmath9 ( or alternatively the total number of stars @xmath10 ) , the density profile , the initial degree of mass segregation @xmath11 and the primordial binary fraction @xmath12 .",
    "we studied a ysc interacting with the sgra * smbh via direct @xmath10-body simulations . to do this",
    ", we consider a set of @xmath13 cluster models , which differ in the initial binary fraction ( @xmath12 ) and in the initial degree of mass segregation ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath12 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of binaries and @xmath10 is the total number of stars in the cluster .",
    "the initial binary fraction of our models assumes the values @xmath16 for both segregated ( @xmath17 ) and unsegregated ( @xmath18 ) clusters .",
    "note that some of our models have a high initial binary fraction .",
    "such an assumption is justified by the fact that both theory and observations suggest that the angular momentum of a collapsing cloud core may be distributed more efficiently into two stars @xcite rather than into a single star or a higher order multipole system .",
    "initially mass - segregated clusters are generated with the method developed in @xcite . in a few words : if the cluster is completely mass segregated ( @xmath17 ) , mcluster assigns the lowest energy orbit to the highest mass star , and the highest energy orbit to the lowest mass star .",
    "intermediate degrees of mass segregation can be achieved by non - perfect ordering of masses and energy orbits @xcite .",
    "table 1 resumes the cases considered .    to generate initial conditions , we follow the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "we set the mass of the cluster to @xmath19 m@xmath20 .",
    "the cluster density profile is modelled with a @xcite profile whose initial half - mass radius is derived from the @xcite relation @xmath21    the stellar masses , @xmath22 ( m@xmath23 ) , are sampled from the initial mass function ( imf ) by @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are normalization factors and @xmath27 m@xmath23 is chosen from the maximum stellar mass - cluster mass relation given in @xcite .",
    "the canonical @xcite period distribution function is adopted for all binaries in the cluster @xmath28 where the period , @xmath29 , is in days .",
    "stars with mass @xmath30 m@xmath20 are randomly paired after sampling the two masses from the chosen imf @xcite .",
    "however , observations show that massive binaries preferentially favour massive companions @xcite , therefore , stars with @xmath31 m@xmath20 are paired together to follow this observational feature ; for details see @xcite .",
    "the initial binary eccentricities , @xmath32 , are drawn from a thermal distribution @xcite , @xmath33    all the models are generated under the assumption that the clusters are in virial equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the time integration of the stellar system was done by means of the publicly available code nbody6 @xcite .",
    "initally , the cluster center - of - mass is set in the galactic disk on the @xmath34-axis at @xmath35 pc from the gc , with an initial velocity of @xmath36 km s@xmath3 along the galactic @xmath37-axis ( the pericenter results to be @xmath38 pc and the orbital eccentricity @xmath39 ) .",
    "we produced @xmath40 different realizations of each model ( generated with different random seeds ) to obtain statistically relevant results .",
    ".cluster models : name , initial binary fraction ( @xmath12 ) and initial mass segregation fraction ( @xmath11 ) .

    "the parameters are chosen so that the galactic circular velocity at the distance of the sun ( @xmath58 kpc ) is @xmath59 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in our simulations the fate of the stars in the cluster is determined by their final amount of energy . after the close cluster - bh interaction a star can remain bound to the cluster @xcite , or can be captured by the bh @xcite or",
    "can be lost from the system @xcite . in this paper , we focus our attention on the stars lost by the system and ejected at such velocities to become unbound with respect to the galaxy , examining , in this context , the role of the cluster initial binary fraction and mass segregation .    the relative ( to the total ) number of ejected ( single and binary ) hvss depends on the initial content of binaries ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as @xmath12 increases , the number of ejected binary hvss increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative fraction of ejected single hvss decreases as the initial content of binaries in the cluster is larger .",
    "we find three possible sources of single hvss .",
    "the first mechanism is equivalent to hills binary disruption @xcite . in this process hvs",
    "is generated as a consequence of the disruption of a binary star that undergoes a close interaction with the galactic smbh . in this case one of the two stars is captured by the smbh and becomes an s - star @xcite .",
    "the second production channel involves a single star and the other @xmath60 stars of the cluster . during the close passage of the cluster around the smbh",
    ", a single star may be removed from the cluster due to the coupled ysc+bh gravitational interaction @xcite .",
    "the third mechanisms is the splitting of a binary hvs into two single hvss .",
    "whereas single hvss can originate from three different mechanisms , binary hvss can originate only from the previous process .",
    "actually , after the ejection from the cluster the binary can undergo three different fates .",
    "one possibility is that the binary star survives , travelling farther at hyper velocity .",
    "if the binary does not survive , it can either merge or disrupt as a consequence of the velocity kick due to the interaction with the smbh , splitting into two single hvss .",
    "this is , actually , the third channel for producing single hvss .",
    "when the binary is accelerated , the kick velocity has to be combined with the binary orbital velocity . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the case where the kick velocity vector is coplanar with the orbital velocity vector of the stars .",
    "it may happen that at the moment of the ejection the velocity of one of the stars in the pair is nearly aligned with the kick , while the companion velocity is unaligned . in this case",
    ", the orbital velocity of the former enhances the kick velocity , while the latter has a slightly lower ejection velocity . as a consequence ,",
    "both the stars of the binary are accelerated to hyper velocities , but start to diverge from each other .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the resulting ejection velocity distributions for the models considered .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the resulting velocity distributions of single hvss for different initial binary fractions of the ysc .",
    "we included in the distribution all the stars with velocity beyond the local escape speed @xmath61 , as determined by the galactic model ( see section 2.1 ) , and consider their velocity at the reference distance of @xmath62 pc from the central bh .",
    "the local ( at @xmath62 pc ) escape speed is @xmath63 km s@xmath3 , which corresponds to the cutoff in the plots .",
    "the distributions extend up to @xmath64 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we fitted our data with @xmath65 different functions , i.e the gamma , weibull , lognormal and normal functions .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov statistical test favours the normal distribution .",
    "figure 3 shows the velocity distributions of single and binary hvss for the model b1s1 , along with the same fits of fig.2 .",
    "also in this case , the best fit is given by the normal distribution .",
    "[ fractions ]     [ dvela ]    [ dvelb ]    @xcite demonstrated that another important feature of the high velocity stars originated as a consequence of the interaction of a globular cluster and a massive bh is the significant level of collimation of the ejected stars .",
    "as an illustrative example , figure 4 shows the distributions of the galactocentric latitude and longitude of single hvss for the model b1s1 .",
    "as mentioned above , the cluster center - of - mass is set on the galactic x - axis at @xmath35 pc off the mw center and has an initial velocity @xmath36 km s@xmath3 along the galactic positive y - axis . as a consequence of the chosen initial conditions ,",
    "the cluster center - of - mass orbital motion lies in the galactic disk .",
    "figure 4 ( top panel ) shows that initially the latitude distribution is peaked at @xmath66 .",
    "this result means that the hvss are ejected nearly in the initial cluster orbital plane . on the other hand ,",
    "the longitude distribution of hvss quantifies the ejection direction with respect to the orbital motion of the cluster .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that high velocity stars are collimated and preferentially ejected near the cluster pericenter .",
    "figure 4 ( bottom panel ) shows the resulting longitude distribution .",
    "the distribution presents a peak at @xmath67 , while the cluster center - of - mass velocity at pericenter has @xmath68 .",
    "this indicates that hvss are ejected near the pericenter along the direction of motion of the cluster .",
    "our results suggest that this mechanism produces single and binary hvss in burst - like events ( when the cluster is near pericenter ) , which will move on the orbital plane and in the direction of the cluster orbital motion . moreover , the binary fraction of these hvs `` jets '' depends on the initial binary fraction in the progenitor cluster .",
    "[ latlong ]      [ hvsmass ]      we investigated also the role of the initial mass segregation comparing results of model b1s1 , fully mass segregated , with those of model b1s0 , not mass segragated .",
    "we see that the segregation affects the mass distribution of hvss .",
    "figure 5 shows the mass distribution of the ejected single hvss for the cases under consideration . in the case of the unsegregated ysc , @xmath69% of ejected hvss",
    "have @xmath70 m@xmath20 . whereas , for a fully segregated ysc the amount of stars with @xmath71 m@xmath20 is not negligible ( @xmath72% of all hvss ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that our model predicts the production of low - mass hvss , as a consequence of the fact that the initial average stellar mass in the ysc is @xmath73 m@xmath20 .",
    "however , the observed hvss are probably main sequence b stars with @xmath74 m@xmath20 @xcite . hence , if hvss originated from the infall of a ysc , the initial mass segregation fraction had to be @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite showed that hvss are clustered in the direction of the constellation leo ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the hvss anisotropy may reflect the anisotropy of the milky way gravitational potential . in the @xcite model ,",
    "the anisotropy reflects the disc inclination from which hvss are generated . in our model ,",
    "the anisotropy of hvss is a natural consequence of the cluster motion at the pericentre .",
    "we study the fate of the ejected binary hvss .",
    "as discussed , binary hvss can undergo three different fates .",
    "the binary star can survive travelling farther at hyper velocity , can merge or can be disrupted as a consequence of the velocity kick .",
    "figure 6 shows the fraction of single hvss that originates as consequence of the binary disruption discussed in the previous section .",
    "this fraction increases when the initial binary fraction is larger . in the case",
    "@xmath76 about @xmath77 of single hvss are generated through this channel .",
    "figure 7 shows the mass , eccentricity and semi - major axis of binary hvss for the model b1s1 . due to the initial choice of mass sampling from the canonical imf @xcite , the mass distribution ( top panel )",
    "is peaked at @xmath70 m@xmath20 .",
    "the eccentricity distribution ( central panel ) shows that ejected binaries are highly eccentric , with a peak at @xmath78 .",
    "the semi - major axis distribution ( bottom panel ) indicates that most of the ejected binary hvss have @xmath79 au . because the average stellar mass in the ysc is @xmath73 , the total mass of the binary @xmath80 m@xmath20 , and @xmath81 , the period of binary hvss results to be @xmath82 days .",
    "figure 7 thus indicates , so , that the binary hvss ejected from an infalling ysc are generally compact and eccentric .",
    "[ dismer ]     [ meccsem ]       such eccentric and compact binary stars can merge while travelling across the galaxy at hypervelocities . if we assume that the evolution of a binary is described by the @xcite eigenevolution , the evolution of orbital elements occurs when the stars of the binary are at the pericentre @xmath83 where @xmath32 is the binary eccentricity , @xmath84 is the binary period in days and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the masses of the primary and secondary , respectively . according to @xcite , the binary eccentricity evolves . after the ejection from the cluster , according to @xmath87 where @xmath88 in the previous equation , @xmath89 au is the sun s radius , while @xmath90 indicates the length scale over which significant evolution of the orbital elements occurs , @xmath91 measures the interaction strength of the two stars @xcite . if eigenevolution occurs during pre - main sequence @xmath92 and @xmath93 , whereas @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the case of main sequence phase .",
    "the initial binary period @xmath96 evolves to @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the initial and final total mass , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial mass ratio @xmath100 is assumed to evolve to @xmath101 where @xmath102 finally , the final mass of the secondary will be @xmath103 , while @xmath104 .",
    "the components of the binary are considered merged if their semi - major axis after eigenevolution is @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "we apply the eigenevolution to the ejected binary hvss to quantify how many of them will merge .",
    "figure 6 shows the fraction of binaries that merge , as a consequence of the eigenevolution , as a function of the initial binary fraction .",
    "the same binaries merge both if we use pre - main sequence @xmath90,@xmath91 and main sequence @xmath106,@xmath107 since merging binaries are very compact ( @xmath108 au ) and eccentric ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we find that the fraction of merged binaries is nearly constant ( @xmath110 ) independent of the initial @xmath12 .",
    "this small fraction of hvss will continue their paths in the galactic field as blue stragglers .",
    "in this paper we investigated the origin of hvss as a consequence of the close passage of a ysc around the milky way s central smbh . during the close encounter",
    ", some stars are stripped from the cluster and may be ejected with high velocities @xcite .",
    "we focussed our attention on the stars lost by the system and ejected at hyper velocities after the interaction with the bh , examining the role of the cluster initial binary fraction and mass segregation .",
    "we found that this mechanism produces single and binary hvss in a burst - like event ( when the cluster is at the orbital pericenter ) , nearly in the initial cluster orbital plane and in the direction of the cluster orbital motion .",
    "the binary fraction of these hvss jets depends on the initial fraction of binaries in the progenitor cluster . on the other side ,",
    "the initial mass segregation affects the mass of ejected stars : the larger the initial segregation fraction , the larger the average mass of hvss .",
    "we also quantified how many binary stars survive at hypervelocities . applying the @xcite eigenevolution formulas we found that @xmath111% of binary hvss will merge to become , eventually , blue straggler hvss .",
    "both binary and blue stragglers hvss have been observed .",
    "@xcite observed a star moving with a velocity of at least @xmath112 km s@xmath3 in the galactic rest frame .",
    "according to stellar atmosphere fits the star is a 9 m@xmath20 main - sequence star @xmath4 kpc away .",
    "the lifetime of this star is several times shorter than its flight time from the milky way , suggesting an lmc origin @xcite or a blue straggler origin @xcite .",
    "the latter channel suggest that the progenitor was likely a binary system ejected from the milky way at @xmath113 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have spotted the first binary hvs candidate @xmath114 kpc far from the gc travelling at @xmath115 km s@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite showed that hvss are clustered in the direction of the constellation leo .",
    "@xcite proposed that the hvs anisotropy could reflect the anisotropy of the galactic potential .",
    "our model predicts that the anisotropy of hvss is a natural consequence of cluster motion at the pericentre .",
    "this is natural if most stars form in clusters @xcite .",
    "hvss are powerful tools to investigate the physics of the gc , being in an accessible region of the sky , and also to study the dark sector of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "when a star cluster passes near the smbh , it produces hvss as a consequence of the strong interaction with the smbh tidal field .",
    "if hvss are generated through the process presented in this paper , by studying their spatial and velocity distribution , it is possible to constrain the physical properties of clusters that have infallen onto the central smbh , over the course of the milky way s history , including their binary and mass composition .",

    "<S> the enormous velocities of the so called hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) derive , likely , from close interactions with massive black holes , binary stars encounters or supernova explosions . in this paper , we investigate the origin of hypervelocity stars as consequence of the close interaction between the milky way central massive black hole and a passing - by young stellar cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we found that both single and binary hvss may be generated in a burst - like event , as the cluster passes near the orbital pericentre . </S>",
    "<S> high velocity stars will move close to the initial cluster orbital plane and in the direction of the cluster orbital motion at the pericentre . </S>",
    "<S> the binary fraction of these hvs jets depends on the primordial binary fraction in the young cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the level of initial mass segregation determines the value of the average mass of the ejected stars . </S>",
    "<S> some binary stars will merge , continuing their travel across and out of the galaxy as blue stragglers .    </S>",
