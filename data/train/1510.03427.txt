    "photophoresis @xcite is a set of phenomena where an incident flux of light drives particle motion though a gas by interaction with the gas molecules . in so - called ` @xmath0-photophoresis ' , or thermo - photophoresis , illumination results in a thermal gradient across the grain . as a result ,",
    "gas molecules recoil from the hot side of the dust grain more violently than they bounce off the cold side , generating a net force .",
    "given sufficiently uniform surface properties and thermal conductivity within the particle , the side of the particle that sees a greater incident light flux will be hotter than the opposite side , even in the face of internal thermal conductivity within the particle and thermal conduction to the surrounding gas . in this scenario",
    "positive photophoresis results , pushing the dust grain away from the source of illumination .",
    "most of the photophoresis literature in astrophysics covers the case of direct illumination , which only formally applies in an optically thin medium .",
    "this is also the case for literature discussing photophoresis in the context of protoplanetary disk , which has to date primarily focussed on the transport of dust grains in optically thin regions of the disk illuminated by the proto - star .",
    "however , many sections of protoplanetary disks and other astrophysical environments are optically thick , so the basic formulation must be extended to cover those environments .",
    "moreover , recent work has shown that turbulent energy dissipation in the accretion disk context is highly localized , resulting in strong spatial temperature fluctuations insulated by high optical depths @xcite .",
    "such hot spots are associated with radiative fluxes which drive photophoresis forces : in effect , a dust grain sees , not its immediate environment , but rather a bubble approximately an optical depth in radius whose surface temperature can vary meaningfully .",
    "the optically thick regime of photophoresis is the appropriate theory for deriving the forces and drift speeds of dust in such an environment .",
    "attention was drawn to the to the possible role of photophoresis in protoplanetary disks by @xcite , focusing primarily on the late , optically thin , stages of protoplanetary disk evolution .",
    "photophoretic drift of particles in a protoplanetary disk has been studied in the context of disks which are sufficiently transparent for the direct illumination from the star to be dominant at the midplane .",
    "@xcite examined photophoresis driven dust levitation in a protoplanetary disk , but applied the optically thin approach with a radiation source located at the disk midplane , and in proposed that photophoresis can levitate cais above the disk in the optically thin region during an fu  ori outburst . in a work immediately preceding this one , @xcite , the scope for photophoresis was expanded to temperature fluctuations within the body of a protoplanetary disk , albeit in a formally one - dimensional treatment . in the atmospheres of accreting giant planets , photophoresis , even in the optically thick regime , can levitate and push out dust grains , limiting the opacity and accelerating the formation of these planets .",
    "the dust grain s thermal conductivity is a central parameter in determining the photophoretic force .",
    "high conductivity reduces the internal thermal gradients and hence the effectiveness of photophoresis ; and existing studies of photophoresis in protoplanetary disks considered specifically the difference between silicate and metal dust grain conductivities @xcite .",
    "solid particles which acquire a porous mantle of uncompacted dust with low conductivity will experience enhanced photophoresis .    in this paper , we extend the optically thin direct illumination framework of photophoresis to the optically thick limit , including the effect of thermal conduction with the ambient gas as well as the impact of concentric shells with different thermal conductivities .",
    "gratifyingly , all these disparate factors can be wrapped into a simple and powerful analytical closed form for the photophoretic forces and drift velocities . as an application",
    ", we consider dust motions in protoplanetary disks and show that the vastly differing thermal conductivities of highly porous and highly compacted dust grains cause a meaningful distinction between the effectiveness of photophoresis for those grains . in inner regions of protoplanetary disks",
    ", we find that photophoresis can dominate over radial drift as a driver of collisions .",
    "finally , we suggest that photophoresis driven by the release of accretion energy deep in the disk can levitate particles to several scale heights in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "we concern ourselves with so - called ` @xmath1-photophoresis ' , or thermo - photophoresis , arising from variation in the particle surface temperature @xmath2 ; as opposed to a photophoresis force resulting from any variation over the surface of the thermal accommodation coefficient @xmath3 ( which measures the rate with which gas molecules thermally equalize with the surface as they impinge upon it ) .",
    "we also restrict our attention here to opaque particles with a size greater than the wavelength corresponding to the temperature of the radiation field , so the photophoresis is positive ( in the direction of the net light flux ) .",
    "furthermore the theory that we derive shall be applicable in the limit that the particle surface temperature is close to the surrounding gas temperature .",
    "finally , for simplicity , we assume perfect blackbody absorptivities and emissivities .",
    "non - perfect blackbodies will have equally weaker radiation heating and cooling terms , increasing the relative effectiveness of the internal thermal conductivity and heat conduction to the gas .    in the free molecular flow regime , which we term `",
    "dilute ' and which is characterised by a knudsen number @xmath4 , the photophoresis force is generated by the momentum of particles impinging on the surface and re - emerging @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the background pressure , @xmath7 is the background gas temperature , @xmath3 is the thermal accommodation coefficient of the particle surface at temperature @xmath2 , and the integral is taken over the surface of a particle . of the above quantities , @xmath8 , and @xmath3 , we assume that only @xmath2 ( and hence @xmath9 ) varies across the particle s surface .    as in @xcite we note that the position - independent part of the integral does not contribute , and linearize the square root in the limit @xmath10 expanding , to linear order we have @xmath11 because @xmath3 is a constant of order unity , in practice",
    "this approximation is that @xmath12 , i.e.  that the particle surface temperature is close to the surrounding gas temperature . to help sustain that approximation , we restrict ourselves to systems with sufficiently slowly spatially varying gas temperature that the temperature field can be treated as linear out to several optical depths .",
    "we choose a coordinate system with the z - axis anti - aligned with any temperature gradient in the gas ; and a spherical coordinate system with the pole ( @xmath13 ) aligned with the z - axis . for a sphere of radius @xmath14 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq_photforce_general ] ) then reduces to @xmath15 if the particle surface temperature @xmath2 is expressed as a legendre series @xmath16 then equation  ( [ eq_photforce_approx ] ) yields @xmath17 this form for the photophoresis force on the sphere is commonly employed , and a significant part of the literature deals with approximations for @xmath18 .",
    "the frequency - dependent intensity field to linear order in an optically thick medium with the temperature varying along the z - axis is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the planck function , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the absorption and scattering opacities @xcite . introducing",

    ", one would expect that typically @xmath29 as a steeper gradient would be rapidly smoothed by radiative thermal diffusion .          to determine the temperature structure of a sphere we need to integrate the incident intensity visible from any given point of the sphere s surface . here",
    "we make use the the assumption that the sphere is opaque , and that the sphere has a size significantly larger than the wavelength corresponding to the temperature of the optically thick radiation field .",
    "thanks to azimuthal symmetry around the @xmath30-axis for a sphere centered on the origin , calculating the incident intensity on the circle defined by intersection of the sphere with the @xmath31 plane suffices .",
    "motivated by the fact that the @xmath32-axis is perpendicular to that circle , we will recalculate the intensity ( equation  [ eq_itheta ] ) in a spherical coordinate system with the @xmath32-axis as its pole .",
    "noting further that this intensity is unchanged by a spatial translation , we define additional coordinate systems which are merely translations of the second coordinate system that place their origins on the circle .",
    "the angle between the surface and the radiation field , and appropriate limits of integration for the incident intensity are then straightforward to determine .",
    "as planned , we first rewrite the intensity field in a new coordinate system , obtained by rotating the original one about the @xmath33 axis , with the @xmath34 , @xmath35 axis directed along @xmath30 , and the pole ( @xmath36 ) lying along the @xmath32 axis . in this coordinate system , equation  ( [ eq_itheta ] ) becomes @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now translate this second coordinate system along @xmath38 to the surface of the sphere , to form a third coordinate system with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 corresponding to @xmath41 , requiring that @xmath42 .",
    "note specifically that the poles of the second and third coordinate systems are aligned , and that the pole of the third coordinate system is tangent to the sphere .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_integral_geometry ] , for @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 from the original coordinate system . because of the azimuthal symmetry around the radiation field , the incident flux on any point on a sphere defined through @xmath45)$ ] in the original coordinate system is the same as the incident flux on the oriented point defined through @xmath46 in the third coordinate system .",
    "we now integrate over the solid angle visible from the point defined through @xmath46 .",
    "the projection of a ray direction onto the surface normal @xmath47 is @xmath48 , and we require the projection of each inwards going ray ( for each visible direction @xmath49 the ray incoming along @xmath50 ) onto the inward directed surface normal @xmath51 .",
    "further , by construction both the pole @xmath52 and the vector @xmath53 are tangent to the sphere s surface , which sets the limits of integration .",
    "the integral for the incident intensity on the surface of a small sphere is therefore @xmath54.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this intensity is then the forcing on the boundary for the heat transfer calculation in the sphere , which will yield the variation of the particle surface temperature @xmath2 .      to solve the problem of the heat transfer within a spherical particle we make several assumptions",
    "first , we include both thermal conduction to the gas , and thermal radiation from the particle surface . the conductive heat flux away from the surface in a dilute gas given by @xcite : @xmath55 second",
    ", we shall assume that the particle is opaque such that the irradiation imparts energy only on the spherical surface of the particle , and not inside the volume .",
    "this breaks down for small , low volume filling fraction particles which might only have one or two monomers along a given ray through the particle .    under these assumptions",
    "the heat equation within the sphere is simply laplace s equation @xmath56 , and the solution can can be expressed as a series in @xmath57 where the @xmath58 are legendre polynomials .",
    "the coefficients of the solution are obtained by solving the boundary condition equating the flux of energy conducted from the surface and radiated from the surface to the incident energy : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the internal temperature of the particle , @xmath61 its thermal conductivity and @xmath14 is its radius .",
    "we decompose the particle temperature into a constant component and a spatially varying one : @xmath62 we linearize the problem with the small parameter being the deviation of the particle temperature @xmath63 the linearized problem is then @xmath64 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by expanding the second term on the left hand side to linear order in @xmath65 and substituting a legendre series for @xmath66 we obtain the solution in terms of the first two terms of the legendre series : @xmath67 and @xmath68 , \\label{t ' } \\\\ & a_1 = -\\frac{8}{3 }   \\frac { \\sigma_{sb } t_g^4 \\gamma}{k } \\left ( 1 + 4 \\sigma_{sb } t_g^3   \\frac{a}{k }   + \\upsilon t_g^{1/2 }   \\frac{a}{k } \\right)^{-1}. \\label{linear_single_a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in appendix  [ app_numericalsolution ] we compare this to a solution of the full problem to verify the validity of the linear approximation in the protoplanetary disk regime .    combining equations  ( [ zeta_definition ] ) , ( [ t_expansion ] ) , ( [ t0 ] ) , ( [ t ] ) and ( [ linear_single_a1 ] ) we find @xmath69 for the @xmath70 expansion of the force integral to hold to linear order , we need one or a combination of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or @xmath73 .    at this point",
    "we can insert this result into equation  ( [ eq_photoforce_a1 ] ) to yield the photophoresis force as @xmath74 where we have used @xmath75 .",
    "we proceed to examine several limiting cases where the form of the force can be usefully simplified .      as mentioned in the previous section , the validity of the @xmath70 expansion of the force integral requires one or a combination of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or @xmath73 .",
    "the first case does not lead to a significant simplification , and the second case leads to a very small photophoresis force . in the third case the photophoresis force on a single - layered spherical particle simplifies to @xmath76 furthermore , where the heat transfer by conduction from the particle to the gas is much smaller than the radiative cooling of the particle , the force further simplifies : @xmath77 equation  ( [ eq_sphere_force_zeta_rad ] ) gives a force which is always greater than the more general form in equation  ( [ eq_sphere_force ] ) . in section  [ sec_heat_transfer_negligible ] we will determine where this difference becomes significant for a specific particle model .",
    "as particles with outer rims of a material with differing thermal conductivity are of interest in protoplanetary disks we proceed now to develop a similar approximation for double layered particles . for a double - layer sphere with the same basic assumptions as for the single layer sphere ,",
    "we develop the solution in terms of series expansions in the core and mantle @xmath78 and @xmath79 layers as @xmath80 the boundary conditions at the core radius @xmath81 match the energy flux and temperature between the core with thermal conductivity @xmath82 and mantle with thermal conductivity @xmath83 through @xmath84 where the second equation assumes that the interface has perfect conduction . at the exterior , mantle plus core radius @xmath14 ,",

    "however , as dust processing continues , the larger and more compacted grains would decouple from the photophoretic force ; which could only play a role during accretion events such as fu orionis outbursts , when we would expect @xmath189 . in particular , we note that chondrule precursors are likely to have been levitated above the midplane .",
    "we have derived the general theory for photophoresis force on an opaque , homogeneous , spherical particle with either one or two layers in a dilute , optically thick medium .",

    ", the theory presented here applies equally well to any astrophysical or terrestrial system with the same basic criteria .",
    "the theory developed here for spherical grains shows that the effects are most pronounced for the lowest conductivity grains .",
    "however , those grains have that property because they are very porous .",
    "the assumptions of opaque spherical particles , used here and in , must break down at some point for sufficiently porous grains .",
    "improving on this state of the art is clearly important future work .    in protoplanetary disks ,",
    "photophoresis driven by accretion processes dissipating energy into heat can have dynamical impacts for highly porous grains , including levitating chondrule precursors mass objects above the midplane .",
    "this effect would rapidly decay as collisions or thermal processing compactify the grains .",
    "photophoresis as a levitation effect in protoplanetary disks may act in concert with other mechanisms , such as the drag due to a disk wind emanating from deep in the disk @xcite .",
    "however , here it important to note that the theory derived in this work applies to opaque grains , which also implies that to feel a photophoretic force they must have a size significantly greater than the wavelength of the thermal radiation in the disk .",
    "the analysis of photophoresis driven dust motion in section  [ sec_applications ] treated only silicate dust .",
    "however grains made of other , such as graphite / organics , ices , or composites , all with different thermal properties , also populate protoplanetary disks ; and can be expected to follow different protophoresis driven motions .",
    "this work motivates basic experiments to determine the appropriate parameters for these more diverse grain compositions .",

    "typically we use 32 legendre polynomials . to check the accuracy of the linear solution which has been expanded in @xmath192 we wish to isolate the primary nonlinear term , with @xmath193 , so we set the conductive cooling flux @xmath194 . then , to analyze the relative error induced by the linear approximation , @xmath195 we need to only vary the parameters @xmath196 and @xmath7 . for dust motion in a protoplanetary disk , @xmath197 $ ] , @xmath198 $ ] , and @xmath199 $ ] . over these ranges we find that the relative error is always less than @xmath200 , so the linear approximation to @xmath18 is excellent .",
