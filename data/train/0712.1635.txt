    "massive stars can trigger the formation of a next generation of stars .",
    "their strong stellar ultraviolet radiation and winds can compress the ambient medium so that it becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses .",
    "numerous examples supporting the scenario of triggered star formation have been proposed , from young stars formed in small bright - rimmed globules inside hii regions to ob associations around kiloparsec supershells ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in this letter , we report the discovery of a unique example of triggered star formation , namely triggering by the progenitor star of a young , core - collapse snr .",
    "the snr ( 54 ) is crab - like , with centrally - brightened synchrotron emission in radio and x - rays @xcite .",
    "the extent of the remnant is @xmath8 and is much fainter than the crab , e.g. , 0.5 jy versus 1040 jy at 1 ghz . at the center , a 136 ms radio / x - ray pulsar with a characteristic age of 2900 yr has been discovered @xcite .",
    "the distance to the snr is 8 kpc (   4 ) .",
    "this object provides a laboratory in which to explore the physics of triggered star formation .",
    "a mid - infrared ( mir ) observation of 54  was done using the infrared camera ( irc ) aboard  on 2007 april 17 .",
    "the observation was performed in a framework of the  mission program : the ism in our galaxy and nearby galaxies ( i d : 1401070.1 , pi : h.k . )",
    "the irc is equipped with three wave band channels covering the 2.626 @xmath9 m wavelength range with a 10@xmath10 @xmath11 10@xmath10 field - of - view ( fov ) @xcite .",
    "we used the mir - l channel in irc02 mode , which gave two band images , l15 and l24 , centered at wavelengths of 15.58 and 22.89 @xmath9 m , respectively .",
    "their angular resolutions are @xmath12 ( l15 ) and @xmath13 ( l24 ) .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 196 s for each band .",
    "the basic calibration and data handling were processed using the standard irc imaging data reduction pipeline version 070104 .",
    "the positional uncertainty is @xmath14 at the 1-@xmath15 confidence level .",
    "1 shows the  l15 image of 54 with the 4.85 ghz radio continuum image overlaid .",
    "the radio image was made from archive data of the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ; the data were originally obtained by @xcite .",
    "the image shows a well - defined , bright , ring - like structure at the position of the snr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the ring appears partially complete with its northeastern portion opened , with faint ridges extending out from the ends of the bright ring .",
    "the bright portion of the ring ( hereafter the  main ring \" ) is elongated along the northwest - southeast direction and has an extent of @xmath16 , or @xmath17 pc at 8 kpc .",
    "the ring is composed of both diffuse and compact sources .",
    "most of the compact sources are point - like except the bright one at the northwestern end .",
    "there are more than 10 point sources distributed along the main ring and several others at the ` tips ' of the faint ridges .",
    "most of them are bright in the 24  image and have colors quite different from foreground / background stars .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) , which is a three - color image produced from the   irac 5.8  ( b ) , 15  ( g ) , and  mips 24  ( r ) images . we obtained the  image of the source from the glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire , release ii ) and mipsgal legacy projects .",
    "there are 11 sources with colors significantly redder than the other stars in the field ( see also the inset in fig .",
    "we conducted photometry of a @xmath18-radius area surrounding the ir loop using the  15 and 24  and the  mips 24   and 70  images .",
    "we have identified 151 sources detected in at least one of the 15 or 24  bands ; most of them were detected at 15  while 76% were detected at 24 . at 70 ,",
    "only one source was identifiable and only upper limits are derived for the rest .",
    "the photometry of stars in the ir loop is not straightforward because of the bright diffuse emission from the loop .",
    "we did psf photometry to minimize the contamination due to the diffuse emission .",
    "sources are crossidentified with the  glimpse catalog , which contains fluxes of the four irac bands , and also with the 2mass second incremental release point source catalog .",
    "2 shows the  versus  color - color plot of the 64 sources detected in the irac and mips 24  bands with a [ 24 ] magnitude error of less than 0.2 mag .",
    "the stars clustered near ( 0.0 , 0.0 ) are probably main - sequence or giant stars along the line of sight .",
    "the sources along the ir loop are well defined in this diagram by their strong  excess and moderate or small  excess , i.e. , @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the sources within this box are marked by filled circles .",
    "the half - filled circles with arrows in the box represent the sources not detected in one of the irac 5.8 and 8.0  bands but are included because they are likely to fall into the box based on their mir colors .",
    "we marked their positions using a shorter irac band , e.g. , if a source is not detected at 8.0  we used [ 5.8 ] instead of [ 8.0 ] and placed an arrow .",
    "the inset shows that all sources in the box are distributed along the ir loop , although the loop of ysos is quite distorted .",
    "their colors are different from those of previously studied ysos in nearby star - forming regions .",
    "we show this by drawing boxes ( dotted lines ) in fig .",
    "2 representing the areas occupied by young embedded protostars with both circumstellar disks and envelopes ( class 0/i ) and pre - main sequence stars with significant circumstellar disks ( class ii ) determined by previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that the ysos in the ir loop do not fall into the usual class 0/i or class ii areas and that this can not be due to extinction .",
    "there are many sources that fall into and around class ii areas .",
    "they are outside the ir loop and will not be discussed further in this paper .",
    "3 ( bottom ) shows a  versus  color - color diagram for all 110 mir sources identified in the 2mass  bands .",
    "the small dots represent sources not detected in  mips 24  or irac bands while the other symbols have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "2 . there are only nine filled / half - filled circles because two ysos with large [ 3.6]@xmath19[5.8 ] ( fig .",
    "2 ) are not identified in the 2mass bands .",
    "the dashed line represents the main - sequence ( ms ) , which is from @xcite for stars later than a0 and is based on calculations of the  colors from kurucz model atmospheres @xcite for stars earlier than a0 .",
    "the dotted line represents interstellar reddening line of an a0 star following the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "note that the ysos are clustered around the positions of reddened ob stars . another way to see",
    "this is from the color - magnitude ( @xmath20 vs. ) diagram ( fig .",
    "3 top ) . in this diagram",
    ", the dashed line represents the ms at 8 kpc calculated from the kurucz model atmospheres and using the relation between effective temperature and radius of ms stars .",
    "we adopt the relation of @xcite for o - type stars and that of @xcite for stars later than b0 . for b0 stars , we interpolate the two with an adopted temperature of @xmath21 k. the dotted lines represent the reddening lines that bound the ysos . the ysos are again clustered around the positions of reddened early - type stars .",
    "the ysos are not aligned along a single ms line , but that may be due to slightly different amounts of extinction toward individual sources .",
    "the extinction toward individual objects can be derived if we assume that they are on the ms , and it ranges from @xmath22 to 9.2 with a mean of @xmath23 mag .",
    "the mean extinction agrees very well with the extinction implied from the x - ray absorbing h columns to the snr , i.e. , @xmath24  mag from @xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the  color - color and color - magnitude diagrams are consistent with the ysos being massive pre - main - sequence stars at 8 kpc .",
    "the spectral types determined from their @xmath20 magnitudes in fig .",
    "3 ( top ) are b1.5 to o8 , which have @xmath2723,000  35,000 k , masses of 1221 , and luminosities of ( 110)@xmath28 .",
    "4 shows the sed of the most luminous source in the @xmath20 band ( the brightest one in the southern part of the loop in fig .",
    "1 ) as an example of the yso seds . the filled symbols represent dereddened fluxes using the value @xmath22 mag derived from fig .",
    "3 and an interstellar reddening law with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the dereddened sed is characterized by a star - like sed with a mir / fir excess at @xmath30  , as we could have inferred from figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "the spectrum at @xmath31  matches reasonably well the sed of a 35,000 k ms star , the temperature of which was determined from its @xmath20 magnitude ( fig .",
    "this spectrum is quite similar to the sed of early herbig be ( hbe ) stars ( spectral type b0-b5 ; group iii ) @xcite . a dip at 610 @xmath9 m similar to that in fig .",
    "4 was observed in hbe stars and has been interpreted as a physical hole in the dust distribution caused by the break - up of inner disks @xcite .",
    "if we consider the mir / fir excess at @xmath30   to arise from an optically thick disk with a constant effective temperature and fit the sed with a 35,000 k star plus a blackbody , we obtain a disk with a temperature of 190 k and a luminosity of @xmath32 , although this fit is not quite satisfactory .",
    "most ysos in the ir loop have seds similar to fig .",
    "4 , with some objects showing weak mir excess also .",
    "the ratio of the disk to stellar luminosity is @xmath33 1% , showing that there is not much circumstellar material near the ysos .",
    "if we use the empirical relationship of @xcite between stellar masses and @xmath34 magnitudes for group iii hbe stars , the masses of the ysos range from 12 to 18   which agrees with our estimates above .",
    "the 2mass survey has a limiting @xmath20-band sensitivity of 14.3 mag , corresponding to a 6  star at 8 kpc with 8 mag of extinction ; no additional mir sources are seen between 13.2 and 14.3 mag in the vicinity of the ir loop , however , which suggests a non - standard imf for this region .",
    "the ir loop surrounds the x - ray / radio bright central portion of the snr almost perfectly . the snr is somewhat extended along the northeast - southwest direction , suggesting that its expansion has been blocked toward the ir ring .",
    "we note that the radio contours are deformed around the northwest , which is consistent with encountering a dense medium there .",
    "the positional coincidence with a detailed spatial correlation strongly suggests that the ir loop and the snr 54 are associated .",
    "the agreement between the extinction toward the ir loop and the x - ray absorbing column toward the snr further supports the association (   3 ) .",
    "the absence of direct evidence for the interaction of the snr shock with the dense gas may be understood if we assume that the ir loop is a partial shell in a low density medium , so that the snr shock has been able to propagate well beyond the loop now .",
    "the distance to 54  has been determined by @xcite , who derived the dispersion measure of the central pulsar ( 308 @xmath35 pc ) and noted that it corresponded to a distance of 812 kpc , depending on the electron - distribution model of the galaxy .",
    "we have obtained an absorption spectrum of the snr using the vla galactic plane survey data @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the snr shows absorption over all positive velocities , which indicates that 54  is beyond the tangent point ( @xmath36  kpc ) .",
    "the absorption peak occurs at + 23 , and at this velocity there is a faint @xmath37co @xmath380 emission coincident with the ir loop in the boston - university - five college radio astronomy observatory galactic ring survey @xcite .",
    "the emission is weak ( @xmath39 k ) and implies a mass @xmath40  .",
    "the kinematic distance corresponding to + 23  is 8.2 kpc using the rotation curve of @xcite , who adopt @xmath41  kpc and @xmath42  .",
    "this is consistent with the distance derived from the pulsar dm .",
    "we adopt 8 kpc as the distance to 54  and the ir loop , and note that this is the distance to the perseus spiral arm in this direction .",
    "the alignment of the ysos along a small , loop - like structure strongly suggests that we are observing star formation triggered by some mechanism originating at the center .",
    "it can not be the snr 54 , however , because the remnant is only a few thousand years old .",
    "instead , the location of the 54  pulsar near the center of the ir loop indicates that it is most likely the progenitor star of the snr and that the massive progenitor star produced an hii region / wind bubble that compressed the ambient medium into a shell that fragmented and collapsed to form the ysos .    what is more interesting about this system is that the triggered star formation must have occurred near the end of the progenitor s life , possibly when it was in its post main - sequence phase .",
    "the ages of early herbig be stars are not well known because they usually can not be estimated from the h - r diagram ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the surrounding diffuse emission in the ir loop , which might be the emission from dust grains in natal cloud heated either by the ysos or / and other nearby b stars , indicates that they are young .",
    "we can set a limit on the age of the ysos by noting that 100  of stars in a region with a radius of 2 pc should have a 1d velocity dispersion of about 0.2  . in order for these stars to have a regular spacing of about 0.7 pc",
    "as observed , they could not have moved more than @xmath43  pc , which sets a limit on their age of about 2 myr .",
    "this limit is significantly shorter than the main - sequence lifetime of the progenitor star : @xcite identified 54 as the remnant of type iip sn , with a progenitor mass @xmath44 .",
    "the destructive impact of a massive star on the ambient molecular cloud increases rapidly with stellar mass @xcite , so the small size of the ir loop and the regular structure seen in the spatial distribution of the ysos suggest that the progenitor was near the lower end of this mass range .",
    "a @xmath45 star has a lifetime @xmath46  myr , and it spends about 10% of its life in the post main - sequence phase @xcite .",
    "the post main - sequence lifetime increases for lower stellar masses .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the ysos formed during the post main - sequence phase , although it is likely that the progenitor had a significant dynamical effect on the natal cloud while it was still on the main sequence",
    ".    we do not have enough information to determine why the triggering was delayed , i.e. , why it did not occur during the first few myr as theories predict ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "two possibilities can be ruled out : the triggering was most likely not due to the wind associated with the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase of evolution , since a typical rsg wind is far too weak to have a significant effect on the shell @xcite . in any case , the rsg wind in 54 may have been particularly weak since no snr shock propagating into ambient or circumstellar medium has been detected @xcite .",
    "one might also think that the temperature and ionization of the ambient molecular gas would drop significantly when the progenitor evolved off the main sequence , but @xcite showed that the temperature and ionization in molecular gas that is near a star do not vary much for effective temperatures in the range @xmath47  k. a potential explanation for the delay in the triggering of the star formation is that the natal cloud was shielded by other material until a few myr ago , when it was exposed to the star by a combination of motion of the star relative to the cloud and photoevaporation of the intervening gas .",
    "future observations will reveal the properties of the newly formed stars and shed light on the triggering of star formation by evolved stars .",
    "this work is based in part on observations with , a jaxa project with the participation of esa , and also in part on observations made with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
