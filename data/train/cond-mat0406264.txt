    "heavy fermion systems ( hfs ) have triggered a growing interest in both experimental and theoretical physics over the last decades .",
    "they are mainly based upon lanthanide or actinide compounds , thus their physics is dominated by the interplay of itinerant ( @xmath3 ) electrons and rather localised electrons from partly filled @xmath4 or @xmath5 electron shells .",
    "these systems generally posses rich phase diagrams , and they show intriguing physical phenomena , such as superconductivity , long - range magnetic order , fermi - liquid and non - fermi - liquid behaviour , and in many cases magnetism and superconductivity coexist . despite much theoretical effort , many open questions remain even for the paramagnetic metallic phase . at low temperatures",
    "this phase is generally characterised by the existence of heavy quasiparticles , which lead to a strongly enhanced specific heat coefficient as well as an enhanced susceptibility .",
    "experiments suggest that the effective mass of the quasiparticles is in the region of several hundreds up to thousand bare electron masses . on a microscopic basis ,",
    "hfs can be described by the periodic anderson model ( pam ) and the kondo lattice model ( klm ) . whereas the first describes a system of localised @xmath2 electrons and conduction electrons , which interact via a hybridisation , the latter yields the microscopic picture of a periodic range of magnetic moments in a metallic host . in the so - called kondo limit",
    "the klm can be regarded as an effective model for the pam .",
    "the physics of both models is associated with the kondo effect @xcite , which was initially examined in connection with a single magnetic impurity interacting with a sea of free conduction electrons . the typical energy scale for this interaction",
    "is provided by the kondo temperature @xmath6 , which shows an exponential dependence on the hybridisation strength .",
    "this relation can not be understood in terms of conventional perturbation theory . beside systems that involve @xmath2 electrons ,",
    "heavy fermion behaviour has also been observed in @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the occurrence of a heavy fermi liquid state is driven by the frustration of the intersite spin couplings  @xcite .",
    "about 10 years ago wegner @xcite and independently gazek and wilson @xcite proposed a scheme with the objective to diagonalise or block - diagonalise hamiltonians on the basis of a continuous unitary transformation .",
    "this method is known as the flow equation method and has been used for the theoretical description of a great variety of physical systems . in a recent application",
    "this method was used to investigate the hubbard model , a paradigm for a strongly correlated lattice system @xcite .",
    "although the authors treated the system on the basis of perturbation theory , they obtained excellent results in the regions of moderate and even strong coupling . in this paper",
    "we apply the flow equation method to the infinite-@xmath0 pam in order to describe the physics of the paramagnetic metallic phase of hfs .",
    "thereby we do not consider perturbative arguments with respect to the hybridisation strength .",
    "we focus on the electronic structure , which suggests the existence of heavy quasiparticles , and show that the lattice kondo temperature features an exponential dependence on the hybridisation strength .",
    "this paper starts off with some general remarks regarding the method and the microscopic model .",
    "afterwards we discuss the application of the method as an approach to the pam .",
    "the last part is devoted to a detailed discussion of our findings .",
    "the pam is the standard model for the description of heavy fermion systems .",
    "supposing the coulomb repulsion of the local @xmath2 electrons being the dominant energy scale in the system , this model can be written in the form @xmath8 in this representation @xmath9 creates an @xmath2 electron on site @xmath10 with spin @xmath11 . due to the infinitely strong coulomb repulsion of two @xmath2 electrons",
    "doubly occupied sites are explicitly excluded .",
    "this is done by the use of hubbard operators rather than usual fermionic creation and destruction operators : @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes the number operator for the @xmath2 electrons .",
    "the essential property of the hubbard operators is that the creation operator @xmath9 only acts on an empty site @xmath10 , and the operator @xmath14 only annihilates a singly occupied state .",
    "the operator @xmath15 stands for the projector on the empty @xmath2 site @xmath10 . in this context",
    "the physical subspace merely comprises singly occupied and empty @xmath2-sites . as a consequence",
    "the completeness relation @xmath16 holds , and the operators obey the following anti - commutation relations @xmath17 the fourier transform of the hubbard operators can be defined in the usual way as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "however , the above introduced commutation relations for the hubbard operators in the local picture result in rather complex commutation relations for the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in eq .",
    "@xmath22 creates a conduction electron with momentum @xmath23 and spin @xmath11 .",
    "whereas the @xmath2 electrons are localised , the conduction electrons possess a dispersion @xmath24 .",
    "the two subsystems are connected via a hybridisation of the strength @xmath25 .",
    "although , in general , a dispersive hybridisation may be examined , we here focus on the case @xmath26 , i.  e. an interaction which is restricted to electrons on the same lattice site only . as a further simplification we only consider a hybridisation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons within the same spin channel .    the model has been in the focus of a great variety of theoretical investigations .",
    "one of the most descriptive ones is the slave - boson mean - field ( sbmf ) theory @xcite . here",
    "the hubbard operators are treated by the introduction of auxiliary boson fields , which ensure the conservation of the commutation relations . on the other hand",
    ", the configuration space of the particles must be restricted due to their bosonic character .",
    "this can be accomplished by considering the constraint with the help of additional couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "the used lagrange multipliers have to be determined self - consistently . for this model",
    "the problem can be solved in the limit @xmath27 , where the latter quantity denotes the spin degeneracy of the @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "a quite similar treatment of the model is provided by the gutzwiller variational method @xcite , which can also be formulated in terms of auxiliary bosons @xcite .",
    "the intriguing result of this approach is an instability of the ground state with respect to ferromagnetic ordering for the case @xmath28 , and the kondo temperature is significantly enhanced compared to the single impurity case .",
    "though the analytical approaches to the pam have given insight to various aspects of heavy fermion systems , they generally have to deal with more or less rude simplifications . in the last decade",
    "a range of numerical solutions emerged .",
    "a great number of recent works are based on the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . here",
    "the pam can be mapped onto an effective single impurity anderson model ( siam ) .",
    "this approach proves to be exact in infinite dimensions , and it is considered to deliver good results even for three - dimensional systems .",
    "the major task of this scheme is a self - consistent numerical solution of the impurity problem , whereby a number of methods , such as wilson s numerical renormalisation group ( nrg )  @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite and iterated perturbations theory ( itp )  @xcite , have been used .",
    "other numerical approaches comprise the diagonalisation of small clusters  @xcite and qmc  @xcite for the full system . as the numerical results of sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] are obtained for a one - dimensional system , we should mention that this system and the corresponding klm have been extensively studied in the framework of the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg )  @xcite .",
    "various studies of the klm suggest this system being in the universality class of luttinger liquids .",
    "the phase diagram of the one - dimensional pam was subject of a series of recent works  @xcite .    some basic properties of the model eq .",
    "have also been discussed in the framework of a renormalisation approach by becker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which incorporates the use of hard cut - off functions .",
    "however , the authors use perturbation theory with respect to the hybridisation strength and neglect processes that connect different @xmath2 sites , which is not sufficient to obtain the proper heavy fermion behaviour .",
    "the flow equation method is based on the formulation of a continuous unitary transformation .",
    "for this reason in various works this approach is refered to as cut .",
    "the transformation is represented by a unitary operator @xmath29 , for a given hamiltonian @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 denotes the flow parameter  @xcite and the according transformed hamiltonian is simply given by @xmath32 . by definition",
    "the operator @xmath33 stands for the identity operator and the fully transformed hamiltonian @xmath34 is written as @xmath35 .",
    "the latter may be regarded as an effective hamiltonian , and due to the unitarity of the mapping it possesses the same system of eigenenergies as @xmath30 .",
    "the flow of @xmath36 can be conveniently formulated in its differential representation @xmath37\\ ] ] and it is governed by the generator @xmath38 this operator can be chosen to map @xmath30 onto a much simpler hamiltonian .",
    "if one starts out , for instance , with a hamiltonian of the structure @xmath39 , where @xmath40 represents a system of free particles and @xmath41 an interaction , the choice @xmath42\\ ] ] indeed triggers the interaction part to vanish in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "this can be proved by some simple calculation and eq",
    ".   represents the original choice of the generator by wegner  @xcite . in this context",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is diagonal or block - diagonal . beside wegner s generator , in the recent years",
    "a variety of diverse generators has been used . as we have mentioned in the introductory section , an independent approach formulated by gazek and wilson was made , in which the hamiltonian is diagonalised by integrating out higher energy contributions .",
    "another choice for the generator was proposed by knetter and uhrig  @xcite .",
    "it has the intriguing feature that it allows the construction of a particle - number conserving effective hamiltonian .",
    "independent of the choice of any particular generator , the transformation can as well be applied to formulate the flow of observables .",
    "similar to the structure we have derived for the hamiltonian , an arbitrary operator is transformed as @xmath44\\ ] ] as a result of this we can take advantage of the invariance of expectation values and correlation functions under unitary transformations . in this sense these quantities can be evaluated with respect to the much simpler hamiltonian @xmath35 by the simultaneous transformation of the operators . if we regard for example the expectation value of an observable @xmath45 , the relation @xmath46 holds , where @xmath47 is the partition function .",
    "the above considerations are instructive for the evaluation of green s functions .",
    "if we address , for instance , the retarded green s function @xmath48 , we can use the fact that these quantities are invariant with regard to a unitary transformation .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the expectation value and the heisenberg time dependence of the operators with respect to the transformed hamiltonian @xmath35 , if we use the transformed operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 at the same time . in terms of",
    "the fourier transformed green s function this can be simply denoted as @xmath51 .",
    "after having discussed the general aspects of the model and the method we now focus on the application of the flow equation approach to the infinite-@xmath0 pam .",
    "this section is organised as follows .",
    "first we introduce an appropriate generator with the objective to map the model onto a much simpler one , and subsequently we discuss the flow of the hamiltonian . in a second step the transformation of observables is examined and the evaluation of expectation values is discussed . the last part of this section then is devoted to the solution of the resulting flow equations .      as we have mentioned in the introductory remarks regarding the flow equation method an appropriate choice of the generator is provided by . the aim of our treatment of the pam is the decoupling of the distinct types of electrons , namely the @xmath1 electrons and the @xmath2 electrons .",
    "they are connected by a hybridisation which is characterised by the energy @xmath52 . if we identify this contribution with the interacting part of the hamiltonian , we recognise that the remaining contribution is not diagonal in the usual sense .",
    "this is due to the representation of the @xmath2 electrons by hubbard operators and results from the incorporation of their strong coulomb interaction .",
    "consequently , we use for the generator the more general form @xmath53 the coefficient @xmath54 has to be determined later . a similar definition has already been used for the flow equations analysis of related models  @xcite .",
    "a first remarkable result of the above choice for the generator is the generation an @xmath2 electron hopping of the form @xmath55 as a consequence of the evaluation of the commutator in eq .  .",
    "a detailed discussion of all contributions is given below .",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath2 electrons is obtained by the fourier transform of the hopping matrix element @xmath56 with the exclusion of local processes @xmath57 with this additional interaction term the hamiltonian of the flow results in the following form : @xmath58 besides the hopping of the @xmath2 electrons an additional energy shift @xmath59 was introduced .    as a general convention for the upcoming considerations we suppress the explicit declaration of the @xmath31-dependence of all energies .",
    "we only use it in some cases in order to avoid confusions .",
    "furthermore , we use for a certain quantity @xmath60 the representation @xmath61 for its initial value , i.  e. @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for the limit @xmath43 .",
    "[ eq : flow_hamiltonian ] poses the central relation of the flow equation method , thus our task is the evaluation of the commutator of the generator and the hamiltonian .",
    "as the scheme suggests the resulting contributions determine the flow of the hamiltonian .",
    "the commutator can be easily calculated by making use of the commutator relation for the hubbard operators . by doing",
    "so we arrive at the following result : @xmath64&= -\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}\\eta_\\mathbf{k}\\,\\bigl(\\varepsilon_\\mathbf{k } -\\varepsilon_f\\bigr)\\,\\bigl ( c_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^\\dagger \\hat{f}_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } + \\hat{f}_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } \\bigr ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}\\sum_{i\\neq j } \\eta_\\mathbf{k}\\,t_{ij}\\,e^{-i\\mathbf{kr}_i }   p_i^0   c_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^\\dagger \\hat{f}_{j\\sigma}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } + \\text{h.~c.}\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma\\sigma'}\\sum_{i\\neq j } \\eta_\\mathbf{k}\\,t_{ij}\\,e^{-i\\mathbf{kr}_i }   \\hat{f}_{i\\sigma'}^\\dagger\\hat{f}_{i\\sigma}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } c_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^\\dagger \\hat{f}_{j\\sigma'}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } + \\text{h.~c . }",

    "the last term represents the generated hopping of the correlated @xmath2 electrons , whose generation we have already discussed in the last paragraph . in terms of hubbard operators both contributions can be characterised as one - particle contributions , whereas the remaining part is comprised of two - particle interactions .",
    "the second and the third term both correspond to a hybridisation - like interaction , which couples to an empty and a singly occupied @xmath2 site , respectively . alike the usual hybridisation term they alter the number of particles in the respective electron subsystem by one . in contrast the interactions in the fourth and fifth line do not change the number of particles within the conduction band or within the @xmath2 electron subsystem .",
    "the penultimate term can be regarded a coqblin - schrieffer interaction .    to cope with all contributions of eq .",
    "we are obliged to introduce a truncation scheme .",
    "the objective of this is to keep the hamiltonian in the form .",
    "this task may be accomplished by various techniques , one of them is the normal ordering of the operators @xcite . because normal ordering must be defined with respect to a bilinear hamiltonian , it is more convenient to use an alternative scheme here .",
    "we simply decouple the higher interactions by use of a hartree - fock decoupling . in this context",
    "the fourth line of is evaluated as @xmath65 where the representation @xmath66 and the relation @xmath67 were used . here",
    "the expectation values are to be evaluated with regard to the hamiltonian , thus they are constant during the entire flow .",
    "obviously , the first two terms on the right hand side contribute to the one - particle terms of the hamiltonian , whereas the last one results in an energy shift .",
    "it should be emphasised that this factorisation scheme preserves the character of the initial interaction with regard to the number of particles in each electron subsystem . in eq .",
    ", for example , both the interaction on the left hand side and the resulting terms on the right hand side preserve the number of @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons .",
    "furthermore , the local projector @xmath15 remains untouched by such a kind of approximation .",
    "a detailed derivation of the decoupling of the remaining interaction is given in appendix [ sec : decoupling ] .",
    "if we collect all the terms that are provided by the factorisation scheme , we recognise that the occurrence of the expectation value @xmath68 is always accompanied by the expectation value @xmath69 . as we have mentioned above",
    "the first denotes the average number of empty @xmath2 sites , and the latter represents the number of singly occupied @xmath2 sites .",
    "since we consider the non - magnetic phase in the present paper , we can deduce the relation @xmath70 from the completeness relation for the local @xmath2 configuration space . as a consequence of this",
    "we conclude that @xmath68 is of order @xmath71 whereas @xmath69 is of order @xmath72 .",
    "the same becomes obvious for the contributions for the energy @xmath73 , where the terms of order @xmath71 come from the parts @xmath74 , and the terms of order @xmath72 are given by the contributions @xmath75 . as a simplification we consider in the following the case of great degeneracy of the electrons , i.e. @xmath27 , and neglect all terms of order @xmath72 .",
    "the spirit of this approximation is rather similar to the sbmf theory , though both approaches can not be simply compared on this level . eventually , we arrive at the following system of differential equations for the one - particle energies of the hamiltonian @xmath76 the system possesses the initial conditions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . from the above equations we can immediately conclude @xmath81 and @xmath82 so that @xmath83 can be eliminated completely , by making use of the first relation .    at this point",
    "we emphasise that we have not used perturbational arguments with respect to the hybridisation strength nor have we used a mean - field decoupling of the coulomb interaction within the above approximation scheme .",
    "this fact is very important with regard to the description of heavy fermion behaviour .    with the form - invariant hamiltonian we know that in the limit @xmath43 the resulting effective hamiltonian is of the form @xmath84 it describes two decoupled subsystems of uncorrelated and correlated electrons and",
    "can therefore not be regarded as diagonal .",
    "this fact is the main difference to other approaches , such as the sbmf theory , which leave a noninteracting hamiltonian .",
    "another important difference is that we do not need to incorporate a side condition , which restricts the number of particles on each @xmath2 sites , for we did not made use of auxiliary boson fields .      in the introduction",
    "we have already discussed the representation of expectation values within the framework of flow equations .",
    "there we concluded that expectation values as well as correlation functions can be easily evaluated on the basis of the derived effective hamiltonian , if we regard the transformed operators at the same time .",
    "the transformation of an arbitrary operator works quite similar to the transformation of the hamiltonian .",
    "if we consider , in the first instance , the flow of the operator @xmath85 , we can write the mapping in the form @xmath86\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar to the transformation of the hamiltonian we have to regard all the contributions that are generated by the commutator on the right hand side .",
    "the operator , of course , has to fulfil the boundary condition @xmath87 .",
    "hence we obtain the lowest order contributions simply by evaluating the commutator with @xmath85 . with this results",
    "we can infer the following form for the @xmath31-dependent operator @xmath88 this is a linear combination of the ordinary operators @xmath85 and @xmath89 with the weighting factors @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "it is the simplest possible representation for the flow of the operator @xmath85 , and higher interactions that are generated by the commutator must be truncated in the same manner as we have treated the flow of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the complete evaluation of the flow equation yields differential equations for the weighting factors @xmath92 here again the @xmath31-dependence has been omitted for the reason of readability .",
    "obviously , the initial values of the weight factors are given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and as a consequence of unitarity they obey the relation @xmath95 in a further step the coefficient @xmath91 can be eliminated , and the flow of @xmath90 is governed by the equation @xmath96    = 2\\sqrt{\\langle p_i^0\\rangle } \\eta_\\mathbf{k}\\ ] ] the transformation of the operator @xmath89 can be treated likewise , and we obtain @xmath97 with the results of the previous paragraph we are now in the position to evaluate all expectation values that occur in the differential equations by using the unitarity of the transformation , i.  e. @xmath98 . here @xmath99 refers to the expectation value with respect to the fully transformed hamiltonian . by inserting the transformed operators , we obtain for the non - local expectation values @xmath100 and @xmath101 in view of the hamiltonian it is clear that there are no contributions from expectation values of the form @xmath102 .",
    "the derivation of the non - local expectation values , which contain contributions from different lattice sites , could be carried out rather intuitively , since we made use of a descriptive transformation scheme for the single operators .",
    "in contrast , the treatment of the local expectation value @xmath68 turns out to be more difficult .",
    "though the projector can be represented in terms of hubbard operators as @xmath103 , its transformation can not simply be carried out by the transformation of the single operators , for this procedure would break the restriction for the @xmath2 electrons to empty and singly occupied sites . instead of that we must transform the entire operator @xmath15 .",
    "the detailed derivation of this expectation value is presented in appendix [ sec : local_expectation ] , and as result we obtain @xmath104\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] altogether , this more sophisticated treatment can also be applied in order to derive the non - local expectation values , if we transform them as pairs rather than as single operators .",
    "the result of this evaluation , though , coincides with the above derivation , and we can use the much easier representation from the last paragraph first for reasons of clearness and second as a starting point for the evaluation of the green s functions .    further on , we wish to discuss the form of the expectation value which is provided by .",
    "if we alternatively start out from the fact that the total number of particles must be conserved under the unitary transformation , we can derive this result in another way .",
    "the relation @xmath105 denotes the particle number conservation .",
    "if we use on the left hand side the expression for the expectation value @xmath106 and divide by the number of sites , we eventually arrive at eq :  .",
    "consequently , we can deduce that the above derivation is consistent with the conservation of the total number of particles .    as a remaining task we have to evaluate the expectation values @xmath107 and @xmath108 with respect to the effective hamiltonian .",
    "as the subsystem of @xmath1 electrons simply consists of non - interacting fermions the respective expression is determined by a fermi distribution .",
    "the calculation of the remaining @xmath2-subsystem is more complex as these particles do not obey a simple statistics .",
    "it is expedient to calculate the demanded expectation value by means of ordinary green s function calculations @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath2 green s function is simply given by @xmath109 ; \\hat{f}_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^\\dagger\\bigr\\rangle\\bigr\\rangle ( \\omega+i\\delta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we set @xmath110 .",
    "this representation suggests a coupling to higher order green s functions , which can be seen by the second term on the right hand side . in order to obtain a closed equation of motion",
    "we again apply the decoupling scheme of the last section and neglect contributions of order @xmath72 . as result",
    "we obtain @xmath111 and , by the application of the spectral theorem , the desired expectation value reads @xmath112 on the right hand side the fermi distribution @xmath113 has been introduced .",
    "the pam during the flow is given by eq .   and leads to an effective hamiltonian of the form , provided we have chosen a generator which ensures the vanishing of the hybridisation @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of the matrix elements is given by a closed set of coupled differential equations , which have to be evaluated for the derivation of physical quantities .",
    "in a first step we try to find an analytical solution . for this purpose",
    "we bring eq . in the following form",
    "@xmath114 here we have substituted @xmath83 following the above discussion .",
    "this equation provides a representation of @xmath115 as function of the one - particle energies and allows us to eliminate this quantity in all other differential equations . with eq .",
    "we are now in the position to rewrite the differential equation for the single - particle energy @xmath24 as @xmath116= ( \\varepsilon_f -\\varepsilon_f^\\ast)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_\\mathbf{k } } { \\mathrm{d}\\ell}\\ ] ] as a simplification for the next discussions we assume that the energy @xmath73 converges rather fast to its limit value , while the main contribution to the evolution of the other energies occur at a larger @xmath31-scale .",
    "this assumption allows us to replace @xmath117 by the constant energy @xmath118 .",
    "such kind of simplification is quite common in terms of flow equations @xcite . with this approximation",
    "the equation can simply be integrated and we arrive at @xmath119 using the fact that @xmath25 vanishes in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "this quadratic equation has the solutions @xmath120 where we have used the representation @xmath121 equivalently , we obtain the following solution for the @xmath2 degrees of freedom @xmath122 the latter describes the excitation energies of the @xmath2 electrons as suggested by eq .  . in order to derive a simple equation for the energy @xmath73 we neglect the term with @xmath123 on the right hand side of , and after having integrated the resulting equation , we obtain @xmath124 the simplification of a constant energy @xmath73",
    "can also be made for the derivation of the weighting factors and allow us the evaluation of expectation values . from",
    "we arrive at @xmath125 altogether the results coincide with the expressions from the sbmf theory . the excitation energies and constitute the electronic structure of the system of two gapped bands .",
    "the overall renormalisation of the @xmath2 level is provided by eq . .",
    "these results are based on the assumption of a fast convergence of @xmath73 compared to all other energies and give us a rough estimate of the electronic structure of the full problem .",
    "however , a thorough examination beyond this simplification requires a numerical treatment of the differential equations .",
    "we would like to stress that we have not used a particular choice for the coefficient @xmath115 .",
    "thus the derived results are valid for any @xmath115 that yields a vanishing hybridisation for the fully transformed hamiltonian .",
    "the above derivation of an analytical solution for the differential equations was based on further simplifications .",
    "a more general solution can be provided by a numerical integration . while the analytical solution was independent of a particular choice of the coefficient @xmath115",
    ", we now need to determine this quantity for the numerical evaluation . an expedient choice is given by @xmath126 since the energy @xmath25 vanishes when @xmath31 goes to infinity .",
    "this becomes obvious by inserting eq . into eq .",
    ", for the differential of @xmath25 is a negative quantity in the entire integration range , while @xmath25 itself is always positive .",
    "the above choice is not dissimilar to wegner s generator .",
    "however , it is not simply obtained by commuting the interacting and the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian , as suggested by eq .",
    ", in that the non - interacting part for the present calculations incorporates the hopping of strongly correlated objects .",
    "in fact , the derivation of the generator uses a factorisation scheme , which has been presented in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : flow ] .",
