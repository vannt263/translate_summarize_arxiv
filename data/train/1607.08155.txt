    "the rapid development of quantum technologies , such as quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite , has been one of the main propellers for the study of quantum entanglement in recent years @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is quite relevant to study the behaviour of entangled particles separated by large distances , as this will be crucial for the creation of global quantum communication systems .",
    "it seems consensual that the next step in this direction is to develop new space - based experiments .",
    "for instance , a satellite - based distribution of entangled keys would allow not only for the development of a worldwide network of quantum communication , but also for the improvement of tests of quantum mechanics .    indeed",
    ", recently , a team of researchers has shown that observers separated by 144 km can share a quantum cryptographic key @xcite by exploiting the randomness and strong quantum correlations inherent to quantum entanglement . as a result of this",
    ", several proposals have been made to study the entanglement between a station on earth s surface and a second station at orbit @xcite .",
    "inspired by these developments , we study here the effect of earth s gravitational field on entangled neutron states .",
    "prior work on this topic can be found in refs .",
    "we analyze the effect of having entangled particles at different values of the gravitational potential and discuss how this could affect an entanglement protocol between an observer in a station on the surface of the earth and a second observer in a station in a low - earth orbit ( leo ) .",
    "of course , gravity , being the feeblest of all known forces , is not expected to upset a given entanglement protocol .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of understanding gravity in a quantum mechanical context impels us to pursue this line of theoretical inquiry and examine the effect of gravity on entangled quantum states .    the problem of a particle under the influence of a constant gravitational field is well known in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "consider a particle of mass m in a gravitational field @xmath0 .",
    "when an horizontal mirror is placed at @xmath1 , a gravitational quantum well ( gqw ) is established @xcite , and the system is described by a potential well of the form @xmath2 , for @xmath3 .",
    "the solutions to the eigenvalue equation , @xmath4 , can be expressed in terms of the airy function of first type , @xmath5 while the energy eigenvalues are determined by the roots of the airy function , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is a scaling factor , @xmath10 is the normalization constant of the _ n_-th level , and @xmath11 corresponds to the maximum height classically allowed for a particle with energy @xmath12 .",
    "the probability of finding the particle is non - vanishing for all values of @xmath13 .",
    "however , it will have a maximum value at the classical turning point @xmath14 . above this height",
    ", the probability of finding the particle decays exponentially .",
    "this quantum system was built experimentally by submitting a beam of ultra - cold neutrons to earth s gravitational well that bounces on a horizontal mirror @xcite .",
    "ultra - cold neutrons are fundamental for this experiment , as they are less likely to be affected by the electromagnetic interaction . in simple terms , the experiment runs as follows : a scatterer / absorber is placed above the horizontal mirror , forming a slit , and the neutron transmission through this slit is measured . if the height of the the scatterer / absorber is larger than the classical turning point for a given quantum state , the neutrons pass through the slit without loss . as the size of the slit decreases , the probability of neutron loss increases until the slit size reaches @xmath14 and the apparatus stops being transparent to neutrons in the _",
    "n_-th quantum state .",
    "this procedure allows also for a criterion for the transition from quantum to classical behaviour @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the influence of gravity on entanglement of states .",
    "we consider entangled gqw states that clearly depend on a continuous variable .",
    "gaussian states are the most studied continuous variable states in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "they have been shown to be useful to construct entanglement protocols and are important testbeds for investigating quantum correlations .",
    "these states are usually described by their covariance matrices , which are built from the second statistical moments of the states and encode all the information about them .",
    "the elements of a covariance matrix , @xmath15 , can be determined by the relations @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a vector of the quadrature operators , and @xmath18 $ ] denotes the mean of the operator @xmath19 evaluated with a density matrix @xmath20 .",
    "since quantum gaussian states can be completely described by their second moments , these covariance matrices are the central elements of the separability or entanglement criteria .",
    "the positivity of the partial transpose ( ppt ) of the covariance matrix is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of a bipartite gaussian state @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we shall see that the states of the gqw system are not gaussian and , thus , an extension of the criteria for the separability of states has to be considered .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the mathematical tools to study entanglement in a bipartite state of the gqw . in section iii ,",
    "we study the effects of considering two particles at different potentials . finally ,",
    "in section iv , we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "we start by considering a bipartite state of the form @xmath21 denotes the _ n_-th level of the gqw , that is , the state of a neutron in a gravitational field @xmath22 with energy @xmath12 and wavefunction @xmath23 . when studying bipartite systems we use @xmath24 to denote a two - particle system with a particle in the energy level _",
    "n _ in subsystem a and a particle in the energy level _",
    "m _ in subsystem b.    to study continuous variable entanglement in this bipartite system , we proceed by determining its wigner function , which in case of gaussian states would be a gaussian function .",
    "first , we consider the density matrix for state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) : @xmath25 we now proceed by applying this density matrix to the wigner function @xmath26    for the computation of the wigner function , the following relationships for airy functions are quite useful @xcite : @xmath27 @xmath28    using these relationships , it is straightforward to show that the wigner function for the bipartite state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) takes the form : @xmath29    it is clear that the system we are considering is not gaussian ; however , having a phase - space description of the system through the wigner function , we are in condition to build the matrices of moments and to carry out continuous variable entanglement tests .",
    "the _ n_-th statistical moment of an operator @xmath19 can be extracted from the wigner function @xcite : @xmath30 where the integrals are calculated over the allowed region of the phase space . for the gqw",
    ", this corresponds to the range @xmath31 in the position variables and @xmath32 in the momentum variables ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we are interested in determining moments up to second order in position and momentum . to achieve this , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wigner ] ) that we have to calculate two types of integrals .",
    "we call integrals of type i those of the form @xmath34 and type ii those of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the combination of variables corresponding to the expected statistical moment",
    ".    most of these integrals are not standard , and thus require a considerable amount of manipulations to be computed .",
    "those of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : type2 ] ) are particularly challenging to evaluate .",
    "however , airy functions possess many algebraic and cyclic properties that can be exploited in order to calculate these integrals .",
    "@xcite is an excellent resource for this task .    performing each of the these calculations , we arrive at the results presented in table [ table : integrals ] .",
    ".results for the integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : type1 ] ) and ( [ eq : type2 ] ) with various combinations @xmath37 of position and momentum variables . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from here , we build the statistical moments by matching the results of table [ table : integrals ] in the way required by the wigner function . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wigner ] ) , we see that the function is composed of four terms , each of which requires the calculation of two integrals : one for subsystem a and another for subsystem b. two of these terms involve only integrals of type i , while the other two involve solely integrals of type ii .    as an example of calculation",
    ", we use the results for @xmath38 to verify that @xmath39 which is one of the main properties of any wigner function .",
    "the only terms contributing to this calculation are those of integrals of type i , since those of type ii vanish .",
    "now we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : covariance ] ) to build the covariance matrix of the bipartite state , which can be shown to take the form : @xmath40 where @xmath41    as it has already been referred , to study gaussian entanglement we would simply have to apply a gaussian test of entanglement to this matrix . a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of gaussian states",
    "is given by the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite . when applied to matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : covariance - state ] ) , the criterion takes the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43    it is easy to show , using the numerical values of the zeros @xmath6 , that all gqw states satisfy this condition and , thus , there is no evidence of entanglement at this level . in fact , considering the two lowest energy levels , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the criterion yields @xmath46 , which implies the states are separable .",
    "considering higher energy levels , the value in the left - hand side becomes larger and the separability criterion is never broken .",
    "[ fig : gaussian - criterion ] shows the numerical results for the application of the criterion for different energy levels .",
    ".,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    however , the peres - horodecki criterion is only a necessary and sufficient condition of separability when applied to gaussian states .",
    "for non - gaussian states , second order criteria may fail to reveal entanglement @xcite .",
    "thus , genuine entanglement of non - gaussian states is only revealed through application of criteria involving higher - order moments .    to achieve this ,",
    "we follow the construction presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is developed a generalization of the positive partial transposition ( ppt ) criterion for continuous variable systems based on the matrices of moments .",
    "the ppt criterion states that a separable state remains positive under partial transposition , and , therefore , a non - positive - partial - transposition ( npt ) state must be entangled .",
    "we start by defining adimensional operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 for subsystem a , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 for subsystem b , such that    @xmath51    we build now a suitable matrix of moments @xmath52 = [ \\langle f_i^\\dagger f_j \\rangle]$ ] that forms the basis for the criterion .",
    "let @xmath53 denote partial transposition of the state @xmath20 with respect to subsystem b. then , the criterion reads as follows : _ a bipartite state @xmath20 is npt if and only if there exists @xmath54 such that _ @xmath55 _ is negative _ @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that if the class @xmath54 of operators has a tensor product structure , @xmath56 , then @xmath57 .",
    "we choose @xmath58 and the corresponding matrix of moments becomes    @xmath59    the next step consists in rewriting the statistical moments of matrix eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppt - matrix ] ) in terms of the statistical moments of the momentum and position variables . performing this",
    "allows us to determine the entries of @xmath60 by applying the results from table [ table : integrals ] .    substituting the numerical values for the zeros of airy functions @xmath6",
    ", it can be shown that any combination of gqw states @xmath61 and @xmath62 satisfies the condition @xmath63 .",
    "these results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : non - gaussian - criterion ] . as an example , if we consider @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath64 . for higher energy levels , this value remains negative .",
    "hence , we conclude that state described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) is npt and the system is entangled .",
    "we aim now to study the behavior of this entangled system when one of its parts moves vertically in the gravitational field . to achieve this , we consider that the particle in subsystem b is displaced to a height @xmath65 relative to that of subsystem a and , at this new position , the particle feels a gravitational field @xmath66 .",
    "looking back at the definitions of the gqw in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : airy - def ] ) and ( [ eq : airy - energy - def ] ) , we see that the new subsystem b is dependent on the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and the new energy levels are given by    @xmath69    we consider again a state of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the _ n_-th energy level of the particle in potential @xmath72 .",
    "the new wigner functions is , thus , dependent on both @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively due to the positions of particle a and particle b. it is also important to note that new normalization factors @xmath75 must be included in the wigner description .",
    "however , it is straightforward to see from the results of table [ table : integrals ] that these normalization factors are easily factored out when we compute any type of statistical moment .",
    "the statistical moments are obtained in the same fashion as those of the previous section : we can , again , distinguish between the two types of integrals and we build the moments by pairing the results of table [ table : integrals ] in the way required by the wigner function .",
    "the only difference is that now all the results involving subsystem b are affected by @xmath74 instead of @xmath73 .",
    "we want to study how the criterion presented in the previous section is affected by this change in the gravitational field . for this purpose",
    "we build the adimensional operators of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : oper - a ] ) and ( [ eq : oper - b ] ) with the new statistical moments in b. since these moments on the position and momentum variables now depend on @xmath74 , all moments in @xmath49 and @xmath50 become affected by the ratio @xmath76    we now build the matrix of moments of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppt - matrix ] ) and apply the ppt criterion for different values of @xmath77 .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : variable - g]-[fig : variable - g - nm - pos ] .     on three combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath62,scaledwidth=70.0% ]     and multiple combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , up to the energy level @xmath78.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    it is clear from the results of figures [ fig : variable - g ] and [ fig : variable - g - nm ] that if the particle b feels a gravitational field @xmath72 weaker than @xmath79 , then the determinant of the matrix of moments remains negative and , thus , the system remains npt .",
    "we expect , therefore , that moving the particle upwards in the gravitational field does not break the entanglement that we have examined in the previous section for the case where the two particles are at the same height .",
    "notice that if we could achieve a scenario where @xmath80 , the results would not be as simple .",
    "as we can see from figures [ fig : variable - g - pos ] and [ fig : variable - g - nm - pos ] , for extreme cases of @xmath81 the determinant becomes positive and the generalization of ppt criterion fails to reveal entanglement .",
    "however , due to the nature of the criterion , it is unclear if the entanglement is indeed broken by the stronger gravitational field or if it is simply a limitation imposed by our choice for the class of operators @xmath82 .     on three combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath62,scaledwidth=70.0% ]     and multiple combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , up to the energy level @xmath78.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    following this , it is clear that if we could devise a system similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was used to verify the presence of entanglement between two observers separated by 144 km , the entanglement of the states would not be disrupted by gravity .",
    "we can think of a system composed of two parts : station a , located at the surface of the earth ; and station b , a platform at height @xmath65 .",
    "station a would be responsible for producing the entangled bipartite state and sending one of the particles to the other station . ideally , station b would be an orbiting platform placed in low - earth orbit ( leo ) , allowing for a separation of hundreds of kilometers between the two stations .",
    "as we have seen , moving one of the particles to station b , which is in a weaker region of the gravitational field , should not break the entanglement of the bipartite system .",
    "more details on the proposals for satellite - based tests of quantum entanglement and , in particular , for platforms at leo can be found in refs .",
