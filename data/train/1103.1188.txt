    "the  grothendieck - teichmller theory \" was developed by drinfeld @xcite with the motivation of quantization of certain hopf algebras related with the monodromy of the kz differential system ( kohno - drinfeld theorem ) , and in close relation with grothendieck s approach to the description of the action of the absolute galois group of the rational number field @xmath1 on theteichmller tower \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main results of this theory is a collection of relations between periods of @xmath2 called the mzv s ( multiple zeta values ) ( see ) .",
    "these relations are derived from the study of the monodromy of the kz system , and fall in three classes : two classes of hexagon and one class of pentagon relations .",
    "the elimination of the hexagon relations ( i.e. , the statement that they are consequences of the pentagon relation ) was established by the second - named author in @xcite ( see theorem [ furusho paper ] below ) .",
    "the proof uses combinatorial arguments based on the cell decomposition of the compactification of the moduli space @xmath3 .",
    "the grothendieck - teichmller theory was extended in the cyclotomic context by the first - named author [ e ] . in this theory ,",
    "an integer @xmath4 is fixed and the analogues of the mzv s are periods of the motivic fundamental group the algebraic curve @xmath5 ( @xmath6 : the group of @xmath7-th roots of unity ) called multiple @xmath8-values ( see ) .",
    "the study of the monodromy of the cyclotomic kz system yields a collection of relations between these numbers .",
    "it is shown that the pro - algebraic variety @xmath9 over @xmath10 ( @xmath10 : a field of characteristic 0 ) arising from the ` cyclotomic kz ' relations is equipped with a torsor structure over pro-@xmath10-algebraic group @xmath11 , which is the extension of @xmath12 by a prounipotent @xmath10-algebraic group , and whose lie @xmath10-algebra @xmath13 is non - negatively graded .",
    "another family of relations between mzv s , the ` double shuffle and regularization relations ' were studied in @xcite ; cyclotomic analogues of these relations were discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , it was proved that these relations are consequences of the ` kz ' and ` cyclotomic kz ' relations .    for particular values of @xmath7 , exceptional symmetries of @xmath14 give rise to additional families of relations . when @xmath0 , these relations were made explicit by broadhurst ( @xcite ) , and for n=4 , by okuda ( @xcite ) ; okuda s relations allow one to recover broadhurst s ( see @xcite  4 ) .",

    "insertion of broadhurst s result in the framework of torsors 4 .   a theory of infinitesimal module categories , leading to a proof of a result left implicit in [ e ] , and which is also used in the proof of ( b ) .",
    "we now explain these results in more detail .",
    "the ` cyclotomic kz ' relations fall in the following classes : the mixed pentagon , octagon and distribution classes ; there is one class of distribution relations for each @xmath15 dividing @xmath7 , @xmath16 .",
    "our first result is the implication of the first distribution relation from the mixed pentagon equation :    if a pair of two group - like elements @xmath17 ( for the notations see below ) satisfies the mixed pentagon equation , then it also satisfies the distribution relation for @xmath18 .    as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain the equality of two groups @xmath19 and of two torsors @xmath20 for a prime @xmath7 ( see corollary [ grtmd = grtm ] ) .    ( b ) .",
    "the lie algebras @xmath13 are defined by mixed pentagon , octagon , speciality and distribution equations .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the speciality condition implies the octagon one .",
    "we prove that for @xmath0 the mixed pentagon equation implies the octagon equation :    for @xmath0 if a pair of two lie elements @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( for the notations see below ) satisfies the mixed pentagon equation , then it also satisfies the octagon equation .",
    "while this result may be viewed as not particularly useful in view of the result of @xcite , its proof might be of interest as it extends the combinatorial arguments of @xcite to a kummer covering @xmath23 of the moduli space @xmath3 .",
    "the pro - algebraic groups @xmath11 are similarly defined by the mixed pentagon , octagon and speciality equations .",
    "we prove that for @xmath0 the octagon equation is implied by the other two equations in the setting :    for @xmath0 if a pair of two group - like element @xmath24 with @xmath25 satisfies the mixed pentagon equation and the special action condition , then it also satisfies the octagon equation .",
