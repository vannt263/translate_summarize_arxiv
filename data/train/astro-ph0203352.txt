    "the present relic neutrino number asymmetry is not directly observable .",
    "hence , there is no firm experimental basis for postulating that the lepton number for each species is zero .",
    "charge neutrality , however , demands that any universal net lepton number beyond the net baryon number must reside entirely within the neutrino sector .",
    "it has been suggested that the total lepton number could be large in the context of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 grand unified theories @xcite , or supersymmetric baryogenesis @xcite based upon the affleck - dine scenario @xcite .",
    "such mechanisms might generate lepton number asymmetry up to ten orders of magnitude larger than the baryon number asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , even if one demands that @xmath22 , it is possible for the lepton numbers @xmath23 of individual neutrino species to be large compared to the baryon number of the universe , @xmath24 , as long as the net total lepton number is small .    moreover , there presently exists at least some marginal cosmological evidence for neutrino asymmetry .",
    "for example , neutrinos with large lepton asymmetry and masses @xmath25 ev might be required to explain the existence of cosmic rays with energies in excess of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff @xcite . also , degenerate , massive ( 2.4 ev ) neutrinos might be required @xcite to provide a good fit to the power spectrum of large scale structure in mixed dark matter models .",
    "it is thus important to carefully scrutinize the limits which cosmology places on the allowed values of possible universal lepton asymmetry .",
    "indeed , a number of recent papers @xcite have addressed this issue with varying degrees of complexity .",
    "the present work differs from those in several details as summarized below .",
    "it represents an independent examination of this issue .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we considered new constraints imposed on neutrino degeneracy from primordial nucleosynthesis . particular attention was paid to the neutrino decoupling temperatures before the nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "of relevance to the present work is that we have shown that neutrinos can decouple at a higher temperature than estimated in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "this means that more particle degrees of freedom could be present at neutrino decoupling .",
    "this causes the relic neutrino temperature to be lower by simple entropy considerations .",
    "a smaller relic neutrino energy density implies that larger neutrino degeneracies may be allowed .",
    "for example , we have shown that interesting regions of the model parameters for big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) are allowed such that substantial lepton asymmetry and baryon density ( even @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the present value of the hubble constant in units of 100 km sec@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 ) are possible while still satisfying the adopted abundance constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "a stronger constraint , however , on lepton asymmetry comes from the power spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) which we now address in the present paper .",
    "we apply a likelihood analysis of neutrino - degenerate models to the combined latest boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and maxima-1 @xcite results .",
    "we note , however , that a recent analysis @xcite of the implications of neutrino oscillations derived from a combination of the atmospheric , and solar neutrino constraints implies much tighter limits on degeneracy for all neutrino flavors .",
    "if neutrino oscillation parameters are in the range of the large mixing angle solution then an upper limit of @xmath29 applies to all neutrino flavors .",
    "the limits derived here do not assume any particular model for neutrino mixing , and should be taken as independent of , and complementary to , those constraints .",
    "the implications of the cmb data for neutrino - degenerate cosmologies have been noted in a number of recent papers @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the effective number of relativistic particles can also arise in other contexts , such as cosmic quintessence @xcite .",
    "the present work , however , differs from those in several respects . for one ,",
    "we consider the most recent combined data sets , not just the first year boomerang data as in @xcite . and generate a marginalized likelihood function for the neutrino degeneracy and other cosmological parameters .",
    "many of the existing studies have marginalized over a more limited set of cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , in @xcite only @xmath30 and and neutrino degeneracy were marginalized to set limits while other cosmological parameters were set to various fixed values . in @xcite , for example , no likelihood analysis was made . in @xcite a likelihood analysis was made but without window functions .",
    "for the present work we use the updated radpack package @xcite described below which includes all relevant window functions .",
    "another difference between our analysis and other works is that our marginalization utilizes a global minimum search algorithm @xcite rather than a discrete grid of cosmological parameters .",
    "marginalizing parameters for each fixed value of one parameter requires at least 1000 model calculations to get @xmath31 accuracy for the @xmath32 minima even by using this algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , in this way we are sure to identify the true marginalized likelihood functions .",
    "the most similar recent likelihood analysis to that described here is in the work of @xcite .",
    "our analysis differs from @xcite in several respects . in the present work we make use of our deduced new family of baryon densities and lepton asymmetries allowed by bbn to assign weak top - hat priors on the derived likelihood functions",
    "this differs from that in @xcite in which separate gaussian likelihood functions were evaluated for the nucleosynthesis constraints and the cmb .",
    "a total likelihood function was then defined by marginalizing over the product of these two functions .",
    "we prefer our method because the uncertainties in the bbn constraints are dominated by systematic errors .",
    "systematic errors are not equivalent to random gaussian errors .",
    "we thus prefer weak top - hat priors as a more realistic representation of the systematic errors in the bbn constraints .",
    "one other important difference is that we adopt a strong gaussian prior of @xmath6 based upon the hubble key project results @xcite . in @xcite weak a top - hat prior of @xmath33 was adopted . as noted above , another difference between the present work and all previous results is that we consider carefully the change in background neutrino temperatures as a function of degeneracy .",
    "although this is a small effect for low degeneracies , it can slightly affect the upper limits .",
    "neutrino degeneracy affects bbn in two ways .",
    "the inclusion of a small amount of electron @xmath34 degeneracy resets the equilibrium neutron to proton ratio at weak - reaction freezeout to @xmath35 .",
    "this can cause a reduction in the primordial helium abundance .",
    "indeed , it has been argued @xcite that the apparent conflict between the low helium abundance inferred from hii regions of metal poor galaxies and the low lyman-@xmath36 deuterium abundance may even require  degeneracy for its resolution .",
    "the present deuterium - absorption limits on @xmath37 requires a large primordial helium abundance of @xmath38 and substantial destruction of primordial @xmath39li in stars .",
    "these conditions tax even the most generous adopted limits from observed light - element abundances @xcite .",
    "thus , a modification of bbn which allows for large values of @xmath4 while still satisfying the constraints from light - element abundances is worth investigating .",
    "such conditions are easily satisfied by neutrino - degenerate models .    the inclusion of either  or  degeneracy on the other hand only enhances the background energy density and therefore the universal expansion rate . during the radiation dominated epoch ,",
    "relativistic neutrinos contribute a large fraction of the mass energy .",
    "thus , even a small modification of the neutrino energy density can significantly affect the expansion .",
    "the energy density @xmath40 due to degenerate neutrinos ( or any other fermions ) are described by the usual fermi - dirac distribution functions @xmath41^{-1}$ ] , where the neutrino degeneracy parameter is defined by @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the neutrino chemical potential .",
    "thus , we have @xmath44 where , @xmath45 denotes the magnitude of the 3-momentum , and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the neutrino mass . here and throughout the paper we use natural units ( @xmath48 ) .    for the present discussion it is sufficient to only consider massless neutrinos .",
    "( possible limits on neutrino - degenerate models with massive neutrinos are considered in @xcite ) .",
    "the energy density in massless neutrinos becomes @xmath49~~,\\ ] ] from which it is clear that degeneracy in any neutrino species tends to increase the energy density .",
    "the associated increased expansion rate tends to increase the neutrino decoupling temperature .",
    "this causes an increase in the primordial helium and other light - element abundances .",
    "since @xmath50 and @xmath51 primarily affect the expansion rate , they are roughly interchangeable as far as their effects on nucleosynthesis or the cmb are concerned .",
    "furthermore , it now seems likely @xcite that the mixing parameters for @xmath52 and @xmath53 involve a large mixing angle and small @xmath54 . in this case",
    "it is plausible that the muon and tau neutrinos were interconverted in the early universe and would therefore obtain nearly an identical degeneracy parameter if an asymmetry exists .",
    "thus , we adopt a conservative model in which the @xmath8 and @xmath9 neutrinos are equally degenerate , @xmath55 .    as shown in @xcite , for each value of @xmath5 there is a unique range of @xmath3 and @xmath30 which satisfies the combined deuterium and primordial helium constraints .",
    "the allowed family of neutrino - degenerate models employed in this work is summarized in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "this figure differs slightly from the family of allowed solutions given in @xcite in that we have adopted the newer d / h constraint from @xcite ( i.e.  d / h @xmath56 ) and slightly different limits on the primordial helium abundance ( @xmath57 ) . in the limit of the standard nondegenerate big bang ( @xmath58 ) our limits on @xmath30 reduce to those of @xcite , i.e.  @xmath59 .",
    "the allowed shaded regions in figure [ fig:1 ] will be adopted as weak top - hat priors in the cmb likelihood analysis described below .",
    "these regions include both the uncertainties from the abundance constraints described above and the uncertainties in the bbn model predictions @xcite .",
    "having defined the family of allowed priors from bbn we can now do a likelihood search for optimum cosmological parameters which fit the cmb data .",
    "several recent works @xcite have explained how neutrino degeneracy can dramatically alter the power spectrum of the cmb . for massless",
    "neutrinos it can be shown @xcite that the only effect of neutrino degeneracy is to increase the background pressure and energy density of relativistic particles .",
    "the essence of this constraint is that degenerate neutrinos increase the energy density in radiation at the time of photon decoupling and delay the time of matter - radiation energy - density equality .",
    "this mainly causes an increase in the amplitude of the first acoustic peak in the cmb power spectrum at @xmath60 .",
    "for example , based upon a @xmath32 analysis @xcite of 19 experimental points and window functions , it was concluded in @xcite that @xmath61 for a single degenerate neutrino species with an @xmath62 cosmology .",
    "however , in the existing cmb constraint calculations @xcite only small degeneracy parameters with the standard relic neutrino temperatures were studied in the derived constraint .",
    "hence , the possible effect of a diminished relic neutrino temperature at high degeneracy needs to be considered . to investigate this",
    "we have done calculations of the cmb power spectrum , @xmath63 based upon the cmbfast code of seljak & zaldarriago @xcite .",
    "we have explicitly modified this code to account for the contribution of massless degenerate neutrinos with varying relic neutrino temperatures @xmath64 for each species @xcite .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are non - gaussian , but can be well represented by an offset log - normal distribution @xcite . as in @xcite",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath32 goodness of fit for a range of theoretical power spectra @xmath65 as follows : we define the goodness of fit by @xmath66 where separate summation over the different data sets is implied . for each set of binned power data",
    "@xmath67 we utilize the published off - set log - normal data from the three data sets .",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 is the measured band power .",
    "the corresponding binned theoretical power spectra are @xmath70}~~,\\ ] ] where the @xmath71 are the published calibration uncertainties taken to be 8% , for maxima-1 and dasi , and 20% for boomerang .",
    "window functions @xmath72 for the three data sets are available on the world wide web .",
    "the error matrix is simply @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the weight matrix for the band powers @xmath69 .",
    "the effect of the calibration uncertainty on the goodness of fit is obtained from @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the total @xmath32 evaluated in this way can be converted @xcite into a likelihood function for each parameter @xmath77 marginalized over the remaining parameter set @xmath78 @xmath79    in neutrino - degenerate models which satisfy the constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite , increasing the neutrino - degeneracy must be accompanied by a commensurate increase in baryon density",
    ". fits to the cmb power spectrum for large degeneracy @xcite , therefore show a suppression of the the second acoustic peak due to baryon drag @xcite .",
    "indeed , such suppression of the second acoustic peak seemed to be present in the first reported power spectra based upon the balloon - based cmb sky maps from the boomerang @xcite and maxima-1 @xcite collaborations .",
    "this remains true for the likelihood analysis based upon a maxima-1 data @xcite which indicates @xmath80 .",
    "however , in the most recent data sets from boomerang @xcite and dasi @xcite the second peak has become much better defined .",
    "both the boomerang and dasi data sets now imply @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this value is close to the value implied by the cosmic deuterium abundance in high - redshift lyman-@xmath36 clouds observed along the line of sight to background quasars @xcite @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "hence , the newer data imply at most a marginal requirement for a larger baryon density or neutrino degeneracy .",
    "indeed , these new data tighten constraints on the possibility of degenerate cosmological neutrinos . in the present paper",
    "we explore the new limits on possible neutrino degeneracy implied by the combined data sets and our bbn constraints .",
    "we limit our consideration to flat @xmath85 cosmological models with ionization parameter @xmath86 .",
    "this is sufficient for our purposes since the likelihood functions so deduced are not expected to be much different if @xmath87 or @xmath9 are varied ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this is because @xmath9 and the spectrum tilt @xmath88 are nearly degenerate parameters , i.e.  changing one is equivalent to changing the other .",
    "moreover , @xmath87 is generally tightly constrained to be near unity anyway .",
    "there are then nine parameters over which we marginalize .",
    "these are @xmath89 .",
    "we utilize a strong gaussian prior for @xmath6 and for the calibration uncertainties @xmath71 as listed above .",
    "also , as noted above , we adopt weak top - hat priors when marginalizing over @xmath4 and @xmath3 designated by the shaded regions of figure [ fig:1 ] for each value of @xmath5 . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued that without some priors on @xmath90 ( through flatness , @xmath27 , etc . )",
    "it is difficult to place bounds on the amount of relativistic matter .",
    "hence , the model constraints adopted here are probably required to break the parameter degeneracy between relativistic and nonrelativistic matter . ultimately , however , high resolution sky maps such as the planck mission will be able to determine separately the amounts of relativistic and nonrelativistic matter .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] illustrates one of the main results of this study .",
    "shown are contours of constant @xmath91 in the @xmath5 vs.  @xmath88 plane for three values of the cosmological constant ( i.e.  @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) and for fixed @xmath94 as noted . for @xmath95 ,",
    "a minimum in @xmath32 develops for values of @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , for a simple 2 parameter search with fixed values , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , neutrino degeneracy is preferred at the level of more than @xmath99 over a nondegenerate model . for smaller values of @xmath100 , this minimum for neutrino - degenerate models becomes even more pronounced .",
    "a second minimum also develops for higher degeneracy ( @xmath101 ) as noted in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the large change in particle degrees of freedom for neutrinos which decouple just above the qcd transition .",
    "however , the goodness of fit is so poor ( @xmath102 ) that it would not be apparent in the contours drawn on figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "hence , this large - degeneracy solution is definitely ruled out by the current cmb power spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the marginalized likelihood distributions for three of the cosmological parameters ( @xmath103 ,  @xmath88 ) considered here . for the present study the likelihood functions for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath90",
    "are related to these since @xmath3 and @xmath4 are functions of @xmath5 and @xmath104 . from figure [ fig:3 ]",
    "we deduce optimum values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "a slight preference for finite neutrino degeneracy is evident @xmath10 .",
    "this preference , however , is not particularly significant . for now , the data mainly imply @xmath107 upper limits on neutrino degeneracy of @xmath108 .",
    "this value implies upper limits of @xmath109 and @xmath110 from figure [ fig:1 ] . for a single large - degeneracy neutrino species ,",
    "these limits become @xmath111 or @xmath112 with a @xmath13 upper limit of @xmath113 .",
    "our results are slightly more stringent than the results from @xcite who found an equivalent single species upper limit based upon the cmb data alone of @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "this is at first surprising given that we have adopted weak top - hat ( instead of gaussian ) priors for the bbn constraint .",
    "we have traced the main reason for the more stringent upper limits derived here to our adoption of a strong gaussian prior on @xmath27 .",
    "a larger neutrino degeneracy is possible if larger values of @xmath27 are permitted .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows contours of constant @xmath91 in the @xmath116 vs.  @xmath88 plane for @xmath97 models with @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 as labeled .",
    "this illustrates the sensitivity of the degenerate solution to the assumed prior for @xmath27 . if weaker priors on @xmath27 are adopted , or if new larger values of @xmath27 in the upper range of the present key - project uncertainty are ever determined , the neutrino - degenerate models could become strongly preferred over the non - degenerate models .",
    "the @xmath117 non - degenerate solution is only the preferred minimum , for all values of @xmath100 , when @xmath120 . this is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows some optimum model power spectra compared with the combined data sets .",
    "the solid line shows our optimum degenerate model for which ( @xmath30 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath100 , @xmath27 , @xmath88 ) @xmath121 ( @xmath122 , @xmath118 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) . for this parameter",
    "set we obtain a total @xmath126 for 29 degrees of freedom implying a nearly perfect fit . for comparison ,",
    "the dotted line shows the best non - degenerate ( @xmath58 ) model [ ( @xmath4 , @xmath100 , @xmath27 , @xmath88 ) @xmath121 ( @xmath122 , @xmath127 , @xmath127,@xmath118 ) ( dotted line ) ] from @xcite .",
    "for illustration we also show the large - degeneracy minimum  [ ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath100 , @xmath27 , @xmath88 ) @xmath121 ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath124 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) ( dot - dashed line ) ] .",
    "in neutrino - degenerate models the larger baryon density associated with the observed low deuterium abundance can be more easily accommodated than in non - degenerate models . moreover , neutrino - degenerate models provide a slightly improved goodness of fit for the latest cmb power spectra from boomerang , dasi , and maxima-1 .    using cosmological models consistent with the constraints from light - element abundances as a function of the neutrino degeneracy parameter @xmath5 , we have shown that a slight maximum in the likelihood function forms for neutrino - degenerate models with @xmath133 . however , the improvement over the nondegenerate models is only at the level of about 0.5@xmath7 .",
    "although this minimum is not particularly statistically significant for the present data set and assumed priors , it could become much more pronounced should larger values of @xmath27 and/or smaller values of @xmath100 ever be established near their current @xmath134 limits .",
    "the present data place @xmath13 limits for two identical large - degeneracy neutrino species is @xmath108 , which implies @xmath109 . for only one species with large degeneracy ,",
    "the limit becomes @xmath111 or @xmath19 .",
    "this is slightly more restrictive than the limits deduced in other studies .",
    "finally , we remark that , since neutrino degeneracy is now limited to such small values , the present work has established that the effects of the changing neutrino decoupling temperature with increased degeneracy has little effect .",
    "hence , previous studies which neglected this effect are justified .",
