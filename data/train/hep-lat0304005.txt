    "one of the important goals of lattice qcd is to understand , from first principles , low - energy hadron phenomenology as a consequence of chiral symmetry .",
    "however , there have been problems with regard to chiral symmetry since the advent of the lattice formulation .",
    "the lack of chiral symmetry in traditional approaches ( such as wilson fermions and staggered fermions ) leads to a plethora of conceptual and technical difficulties .",
    "in particular , due to critical slowing down and the existence of exceptional configurations , there is a practical limit on how low in quark ( or pion ) mass one can carry out a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the existing calculations with these fermions are typically limited to pion mass greater than @xmath14 .",
    "as such , the extrapolation from the current lattice data with pion mass above @xmath15 , sometimes well above , to the physical pion mass of @xmath16 is both a theoretical and a practical challenge .",
    "the primary concern is whether the quark mass region ( of the lattice data ) is inside the range where @xmath6pt applies .",
    "if not , one does not have a reliable analytic form in quark mass dependence to allow for an unbiased extrapolation .",
    "furthermore , most of the quenched @xmath6pt calculations are carried out at one - loop order ; this limits its range of applicability further , to even smaller quark masses .",
    "how small does the quark mass have to be in order to see the chiral behavior predicted by @xmath6pt ? is the strange quark in the radius of convergence of @xmath6pt ?",
    "is there a way to model the chiral extrapolation from well above a @xmath17 pion mass without introducing systematic errors ?",
    "these were some of the issues addressed in the panel discussion during the _ lattice 2002 _ conference  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , recent progress in lattice fermions has led to formulations ( such as domain - wall fermions , overlap fermions , and the fixed - point actions ) with lattice chiral symmetry at finite cut - off . as a consequence , many chiral - symmetry relations  @xcite and the quark propagator",
    "@xcite preserve the same structure as in the continuum . while a lot of progress has been made in checking the chiral symmetries in all these three formulations , we find that overlap fermions  @xcite offer several distinct advantages .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated that one can simulate near the physical quark - mass region with very gentle critical slowing down  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the overlap - fermion inverter can accommodate multiple masses in the calculation of quark propagators  @xcite and thus is particularly well - suited for studying the details of the logarithmically - varying mass dependence of physical observables .",
    "thirdly , we find that the @xmath18 and @xmath19 errors are small  @xcite .",
    "( there are no @xmath20 errors due to chiral symmetry  @xcite . ) for these reasons , in this paper we use overlap fermions in a quenched lattice calculation to study the chiral logs in the pion mass , the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath5 , the pion decay constant @xmath1 , and the nucleon mass .",
    "we determine how small a quark mass or pion mass needs to be for one - loop @xmath6pt to be valid . in the present work ,",
    "we only consider hadrons with degenerate quark masses .",
    "quantities involving the strange quark such as the kaon mass and decay constant will be studied later .",
    "our calculation is done on a @xmath0 lattice with 80 quenched gauge configurations generated with the iwasaki gauge action  @xcite at @xmath21 and the quark propagators are calculated with overlap fermions .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath22 , as determined from the pion decay constant @xmath23 ; the box size is @xmath24 .",
    "the massive overlap dirac operator  @xcite is defined so that at tree - level there is no mass or wavefunction renormalization  @xcite , @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the matrix sign function and @xmath27 is taken to be the hermitian wilson - dirac operator , i.e.  @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is the usual wilson fermion operator , except with a negative mass parameter @xmath30 in which @xmath31 .",
    "we take @xmath32 in our calculation which corresponds to @xmath33 .    throughout the paper",
    ", we shall use lattice units for dimensionful quantities , except that the lattice spacing @xmath34 will be explicit in figures .",
    "the numerical aspects of the calculation have been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the new ingredient is the adoption of the zolotarev optimal rational approximation  @xcite of the matrix sign function .    to approximate the function @xmath35 ,",
    "it is suggested  @xcite that one should consider the minimization of @xmath36 being approximated by a rational polynomial @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are polynomials with degree @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "it was proven by zolotarev  @xcite that @xmath42 is the @xmath43-optimal rational approximation for the sign function on @xmath44 \\cup [ |\\lambda_{min}| , |\\lambda_{max}|]$ ] . by way of zolotarev s theorem  @xcite , there is an analytic solution @xmath45 where the coefficients can be expressed in terms of jacobian elliptic functions @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the complete elliptic integral . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath49 is determined by the condition @xmath50}[1-\\sqrt{x}f(x ) ] = -\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "the solid line is the current 14th degree zolotarev approximation .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines are the 14th  @xcite and 12th  @xcite degree remez approximations respectively . ]",
    "however , there is a worry when the sign function @xmath52 is not bounded by unity because of slight numerical imprecision . from the cauchy - schwartz inequality @xmath53 with @xmath52 approximated by @xmath54",
    "could have superfluous unphysical zero modes  @xcite . in view of this",
    ", we fine - tune the parameter @xmath49 by reducing it a little from the value determined from eq .",
    "( [ con_a ] ) to minimize the positive residual .",
    "this doubles the worst residuals .    for the wilson action kernel @xmath55 inside the sign function , the largest eigenvalue is around 2.43 and",
    "is fairly stable over the configuration space .",
    "furthermore , we find that the eigenstates of @xmath27 to be projected out become dense at @xmath56 .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to specify @xmath57 . with @xmath58 ,",
    "this gives @xmath59 which is smaller than the largest eigenstates ( @xmath60 ) we project out from the kernel @xmath27 .",
    "since the coefficients of the rational polynomial approximation are expressed in terms of the jacobian elliptic functions , one can use as high a degree of the polynomials as the memory can hold in the multi - mass algorithm . in practice",
    ", we use 14th degree which is a sufficiently good approximation for our calculation .",

    "( [ zolo ] ) .",
    "as we can see , in the selected window [ 0.031 , 2.5 ] , the approximation is better than @xmath66 .",
    "this is a good deal better than the earlier attempts which approximate @xmath67 to @xmath35 with the remez algorithm in which case the resultant approximation to the sign function with @xmath68 is not optimal in the range @xmath69 \\cup [ |\\lambda_{min}| , |\\lambda_{max}|]$ ] .",
    "we plot the residual @xmath51 for the 14th degree  @xcite approximation @xmath70 and 12th degree  @xcite approximation @xmath71 with the remez method in comparison with the 14th degree zolotarev approximation @xmath72 .",
    "we see that the remez method gives residuals in the order of @xmath73 in the relevant range [ 0.031 , 2.5 ] .",
    "we note that according to chebyshev s theorem , the errors of the optimal rational approximation @xmath74 have @xmath75 alternating signs in the range of the approximation .",
    "since the zolotarev approximation to the sign function is optimal , it should satisfy this requirement .",
    "in other words , there should be 29 alternating maxima and minima ( including the endpoints of the range ) for the approximation with @xmath76 . as seen in fig .",

    "@xmath109 from the low mass fit is much larger than that of the high mass fit where @xmath110 .",
    "the chiral extrapolation has always been a major challenge in lattice qcd calculations , primarily due to the fact that one does not know if the formula used to fit is correct in the range of the available data .",
    "the idea of using @xmath6pt to guide the fit is useful and appropriate except it is complicated by the fact that one does not know the range in where the one - loop formula is valid . in this work",
    ", we attempt to answer this question by fitting the data from our smallest pion mass ( close to the physical value ) upward and seeing where the low - energy parameters change .",
    "this is commensurate with the @xmath6pt approach which expands around the small pion mass and momentum .",
    "the chiral log @xmath7 from fitting the pion mass to the quenched one - loop chiral formula clearly demonstrates a sharp transition around @xmath111 in the pion mass .",
    "we take this as an evidence to reveal the upper limit for the applicability of the one - loop formula in quenched @xmath6pt .",
    "we have also fitted the pion mass with the cactus re - summed diagrams in quenched @xmath6pt and the results suggest that its range of applicability extends beyond the one - loop formula .",
    "we should point out that fitting with the cactus re - summed diagrams is preferred over the one - loop formula since it gives a scale - independent @xmath7 .",
    "however , not all the physical quantities have cactus re - summed results in the @xmath6pt and in many cases , one would rely on one - loop formula to do the chiral fitting .",
    "thus , it is essential to find out where the one - loop formula is valid . to be sure that this is not skewed by the finite volume effects",
    ", we compared our data on the @xmath0 lattice against those on the @xmath10 lattice and found that the finite volume errors are much smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "although less certain due to larger errors , the analytic term in the @xmath112 mass and the non - leading chiral log in @xmath1 show variations in the pion mass range of @xmath111 , and the @xmath78 coefficients change by a factor @xmath113 compared with those from fits involving exclusively pion masses beyond this range .",
    "thus we tentatively conclude that the one - loop quenched @xmath6pt is valid for pion mass less than @xmath14 .",
    "it is claimed that using a different regularization scheme such as the finite range regularization  @xcite will extend the range of validity for the one - loop quenched @xmath6pt from that of the dimensional regularization , but it remains to be checked by lattice monte carlo data at low pion mass .",
    "one of the valuable lessons learned in this study is that it seems futile to extrapolate to the chiral region from pion mass beyond @xmath14 .",
    "we tried to fit the pion mass with the one - loop formula by extrapolating from @xmath114 and found that , no matter how small pion masses one includes , @xmath7 is inevitably different ( by more than two sigmas ) from that obtained with the data limited to @xmath115 .",
    "one could try to model the functional form at higher masses , but it is not likely to succeed , because one does not know _ a priori _ how and when the modeled formula eases into that of the one - loop chiral @xmath6pt .",
    "direct simulation at pion masses less than @xmath14 is nearly impossible ( or at the very least an extremely difficult task ) for lattice calculations employing fermion actions which suffer from exceptional configurations and/or critical slowing down .",
    "an overlap - fermion calculation is numerically intensive , but with approximately fixed cost  its critical slowing down is rather mild  @xcite .",
    "the fact that it has chiral symmetry alleviates the worry that something may go wrong at small quark masses .",
    "furthermore , the chiral behavior study is greatly enhanced by the incorporation of the multi - mass algorithm which facilitates the constrained curve - fitting method to discern the log structure .",
    "one does not know how different the chiral behavior in full qcd will be from that of the quenched approximation , but it is hard to imagine that there are different scales for the sea and valence quarks .",
    "if so , one will need to work harder to lower the dynamical quark masses such that the corresponding pion mass is below @xmath14 .",
