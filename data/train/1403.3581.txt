    "the duality of @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in 4-dim.minkowki space with type iib superstring theory on @xmath3 @xcite has initiated a wealth of investigations aimed at exploiting the ads / cft correspondence to relate mutually properties of the gravitation sector ( which is anti - de sitter ( ads ) in 5-dim .",

    "such techniques look particularly useful for 4-dim .  strongly coupled theories , where real - time processes are difficult to access .",
    "this in turn applies especially to strongly interacting systems , as subjects to qcd , created in the course of relativistic heavy - ion collisions , i.e.  the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . here ,",

    "is the bulk viscosity which has a potentially strong impact on the analysis of the flow pattern in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite and may help to solve the photon-@xmath4 puzzle @xcite .",
    "the gravity dual of qcd , even in the pure yang - mills sector , is not known .",
    "moreover , qcd is not a cft since , due to dimensional transmutation , an inherent energy scale is emergent which steers the running coupling .",
    "in such a situation and with a lacking top - down approach from string theory , it looks promising to utilize a bottom - up approach which incorporates a selected set of properties one is going to calculate after an appropriate adjustment of the 5-dim .",
    "einstein gravity theory which emerges , strictly speaking , only in the large-@xmath5 limit and at large t hooft coupling .",
    "a famous example is the gravity - scalar set - up , where a real scalar field is consistently coupled to gravity .",
    "the scalar @xmath6 , dual to an operator @xmath7 , breaks conformal invariance of ads space , simulating the corresponding breaking in yang - mills theory , the latter being expressed by the trace anomaly relation @xmath8 of the yang - mills energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 , @xmath10 function , running coupling @xmath11 and trace of the field strength tensor squared @xmath12 .",
    "being interested in thermodynamic properties of the gluon plasma one embeds in the asymptotically ads space a black brane which introduces a temperature via hawking temperature and an entropy via bekenstein - hawking entropy . besides the equilibrium thermodynamics , encoded in the gravity metric as dual of the gauge theory energy - momentum tensor , near - to - equilibrium quantities are accessible as correlators based on the energy - momentum tensor . for a medium without",
    "conserved charges these are the shear and bulk viscosities as first - order transport coefficients in a gradient expansion .",
    "the class of gravity - scalar duals is defined by the action @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gibbons - hawking surface term , irrelevant or our purposes , and @xmath15 denotes the 5-dim .",

    "@xmath16 determines the self - interaction of the scalar @xmath6 ; it contains the constant term @xmath17 ensuring asymptotic ads behavior with @xmath18 being the curvature scale set by the negative cosmological constant .",

    "the scalar is supposed to have a radial profile @xmath26 which for potentials such as @xmath27 is constrained by the equation of motion to @xmath28 near the boundary of ads , where @xmath29 implies an additional term @xmath30 as deformation of the original cft and @xmath31 , i.e.  @xmath6 is holographically dual to the operator @xmath32 with conformal dimension @xmath33 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the dual operator is exactly marginal and the scalar field is massless , while for @xmath35 the source @xmath36 introduces a mass scale @xmath37 which explicitly breaks conformal invariance .",
    "the mass @xmath38 and the conformal dimension @xmath33 are related by @xmath39 , which must satisfy @xmath40 to fulfill the breitenlohner - freedman bound .",
    "renormalizability on the gauge theory side requires @xmath41 , i.e.  @xmath42 .",
    "while an extension to @xmath43 is possible @xcite , we restrict our attention to the upper branch of the mass - dimension relation and relevant operators , i.e.  @xmath44 .",
    "this is already a special setting which follows , e.g. , @xcite and serves as outline of our analysis below .",
    "the improved holographic qcd ( ihqcd ) model @xcite , in contrast , is based on different potential asymptotics @xmath45 which encodes the running t hooft coupling @xmath46 close to the boundary ( here at @xmath47 ) and results in the marginal case @xmath34 , while , for large t hooft coupling , @xmath16 is constructed to accomodate confinement and a linear glueball spectrum , cf .",

    "einstein s equations determine , via the above conditions at the boundary , the metric coefficients at @xmath52 . to be specific we utilize @xmath53 with @xmath54 from @xcite , but use solely the matching condition to lattice data of the su(3 ) yang - mills equation of state in a finite temperature interval above @xmath1 .",
