    "large ice or water cherenkov detectors may observe up to 100,000 @xmath3 per year @xcite .",
    "these events are used for a wide variety of analyses , including searches for point sources of neutrinos @xcite , diffuse extraterrestrial neutrinos @xcite , standard and non - standard neutrino oscillations @xcite , and measurements of the total neutrino - nucleon cross - section via neutrino absorption in the earth .",
    "these analyses rely upon the measurement of the neutrino energy , which is determined from the energy of the muon that is created in the neutrino interaction . above @xmath41  tev ,",
    "the muon energy is usually determined by measuring the specific energy loss , @xmath0 , of the muon as it travels through the detector .",
    "the cherenkov photons from the muon and also those derived from the charged particles produced by stochastic ( random ) muon interactions are then detected .",
    "this approach is disadvantageous because , for @xmath5  tev , muons lose most of their energy stochastically , and a small number of high - energy interactions will not only skew the mean but also enlarge the spread in @xmath0 values .    in this paper , we present an improved method for calculating the muon energy loss , which leads to significant improvement in the energy resolution . instead of averaging the muon @xmath0 over the entire observed muon path length , we divide the path into independent segments , or bins .",
    "the @xmath0 is calculated separately for each bin .",
    "then , the bins with the highest @xmath0 values are discarded before calculating a new average @xmath0 , thus producing a truncated mean .",
    "this method is successful because the truncated mean minimizes the effects of the large stochastic events which would otherwise skew the mean and enlarge the spread .",
    "this is the first time that the truncated mean has been systematically applied to the energy measurement of high - energy muons .",
    "the truncated mean method has previously been calculated for muons @xcite , although that analysis did not use it to determine the muon energy .",
    "the method was also explored at a basic level for the dumand project @xcite .",
    "the method has parallels to the one that was used to identify pions , kaons , and protons in wire chambers from their specific energy loss @xmath0 in the gas . by discarding the highest 30% or 40% of the @xmath0 measurements from the wires ,",
    "the energy resolution was greatly improved @xcite . as with wire chamber @xmath0 measurements ,",
    "the muon energy resolution is improved by discarding the most energetic stochastic losses .",
    "this method should be applicable to any large water or ice cherenkov detector , such as icecube @xcite , antares @xcite , or the proposed km3net @xcite , memphys @xcite , or hyper - kamiokande ( hyper - k ) @xcite .",
    "this approach may also be useful for proposed scintillator or liquid argon detectors , such as the low energy neutrino astronomy detector ( lena ) @xcite or the long - baseline neutrino experiment ( lbne ) @xcite .",
    "muons lose energy via ionization and by stochastic processes such as bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear interactions @xcite .",
    "muons also emit cherenkov radiation , but this is a very small fraction of the total energy loss .",
    "ionization loss is roughly independent of muon energy and essentially constant per unit length , while the @xmath0 due to stochastic processes rises linearly with the energy .",
    "thus , the total average energy loss of the muon is @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 0.0024  gev ( g/@xmath8)@xmath9 accounts for the energy loss due to ionization , and @xmath10 0.000032 ( g/@xmath8)@xmath9 is due to the stochastic energy loss @xcite .",
    "ionization effects are dominant for muons below @xmath4500  gev , at which point the sum of bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear effects is larger than ionization . as muon energy increases to @xmath410 tev , ionization effects account for only @xmath49% of the total muon energy loss , with a much reduced contribution as muon energy increases @xcite .",
    "two main methods are used to measure @xmath11 . for lower - energy muons ,",
    "the energy is proportional to the path length .",
    "this approach works if the muon is contained within the detector , and the starting and stopping points can be determined .",
    "for example , a 300  gev muon has a most probable path length of @xmath41  km in ice .",
    "the most probable path length is @xmath42  km for a 1  tev muon , and the length rises only logarithmically with @xmath11 , reaching 20  km for a 1  pev muon @xcite .    at energies above a few hundred gev ,",
    "one measures the @xmath0 and infers @xmath11 from that value , either by using eq .",
    "[ eq : dedx ] as an approximation or by calculating the correlation using monte carlo simulation .",
    "the total energy loss in the entire detector is summed , either using calorimetric measurements of @xmath0 ( such as by the frejus collaboration ) @xcite or by observing the light produced by the stochastic interactions of the muon and charged particles @xcite .",
    "muon energy loss is a complex sequence of events where the stochastic processes create many secondary particles that are also subject to further interactions that can result in additional charged particles .",
    "the charged particles produce cherenkov light with a flux that is proportional to the particle energy .",
    "the icecube neutrino detector is highly suited for a study involving muon energy loss . this analysis used icecube in its 2010 configuration , when the detector consisted of 79  vertical strings ( with roughly 125  m horizontal spacing in a triangular grid ) , with 60  optical modules per string ( with 17  m vertical spacing ) between 1450 and 2450 m below the surface of the ice sheet at the south pole .",
    "this included deepcore , which is a denser subarray of strings near the detector center with more - sensitive optical modules placed preferentially on the bottom 400  m of each string @xcite .",
    "each optical module holds a 25  cm photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , plus associated electronics for data acquisition , control , and calibration @xcite .",
    "simulated muon trajectories were determined using a program called neutrino - generator ( nugen ) which is based upon the all neutrino interaction simulation ( anis ) @xcite .",
    "nugen simulation includes several effects , including the ice / rock boundary below the detector , earth - neutrino absorption using the density profile from the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite , neutral current regeneration , etc . , but it does not include neutrino oscillations .",
    "the program starts with an isotropic distribution of neutrinos on the earth s surface , following , in this case , a @xmath12 spectrum for 10  gev  @xmath13  1  eev .",
    "these neutrino events can be reweighted to simulate softer spectra .",
    "nugen then propagates the neutrinos to the south pole , accounting for neutrino absorption in the earth .",
    "finally , nugen simulates the neutrino interactions .",
    "the resulting muons are propagated through the ice using the muon monte carlo ( mmc ) code @xcite , which includes detailed models for muon energy loss and the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect @xcite .    from the energy deposition determined by mmc",
    ", a program called photonics determines the number and timing distribution of expected photoelectrons for a given optical module @xcite .",
    "photonics also accounts for the detector geometry of the optical modules .",
    "finally , a set of detector simulation programs models the response of the pmt , electronics , and triggers @xcite .",
    "then the simulated data are analyzed using standard icecube reconstruction programs .",
    "muon tracks are typically reconstructed with an angular resolution of  @xmath14  1  degree @xcite and a positional accuracy ( in the plane perpendicular to the track ) of a few meters .",
    "detailed simulation verification studies at a low - level @xcite and high - level @xcite have been published .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in simulation is largely due to the understanding of the optical properties of the ice , with smaller contributions from the angular acceptance and saturation effects of the optical sensors . an analysis using in situ light sources @xcite discusses the ice properties in detail , with a new paper from icecube forthcoming .",
    "in addition , simulations were completed using 3 different ice models that resulted in a shifting of the mean but no degradation in the energy resolution , with an overall maximum variation of 13% in the energy reconstruction .      before discussing the truncated mean @xmath0 in detail",
    ", we will discuss the more conventional approach .",
    "first , the number of photoelectrons observed by all of the optical modules is summed .",
    "then , the expected number of photoelectrons for a fixed energy loss of 1  gev / m with the same trajectory is calculated . since the photoelectron yield is expected to be directly proportional to the muon energy loss rate ,",
    "the calculated @xmath0 value is equal to the ratio of the observed number of photoelectrons to the expected number for the 1  gev / m track , multiplied by 1  gev / m .",
    "this linear relationship is a proper @xmath0 approximation for muon energies above @xmath41  tev .",
    "because the method uses the distance between each sensor and the muon track , it automatically accounts for varying track geometries , sensor densities , and optical properties of the detector medium , since those effects are included in both the observed and expected numbers of photoelectrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : log_orig ] shows a scatter plot of simulated muon energy versus calculated @xmath0 . because the entire track is used , the simulated muon energy value comes from the track s closest approach to the center of the detector ( instead of at the entrance to or exit from the detector volume ) .",
    "the @xmath0 values have a large spread .",
    "some of the spread is due to the limited sampling by the sensors and consequently the uncertain measurement of the energy loss .",

    "for a specific @xmath0 value , the calculated energy using the fit equations for the bulk of the events will be too low .",
    "this pushes the peak of the distribution of energy residuals toward the negative .",
    "fortunately , in a full analysis , this bias would cancel out if the method were used identically for both data and simulation , and the spread would be the most relevant issue .    in this analysis , we used both the gaussian @xmath17 and the rms to characterize the improvements in the spread in calculated @xmath0 and @xmath11 . in most cases ,",

    "then a fraction of the bins ( using the optimization discussed below ) with the highest ratios are discarded , and the truncated @xmath0 is calculated by summing the remaining observed photoelectrons and expected photoelectrons and creating a new ratio .",
    "many factors influence the choice of bin size , with the objective to create bins as independent from each other as possible .",
    "large cherenkov detectors use sparse sampling with sizeable distances between sensors , and each sensor observes light over a limited track segment .",
    "the length of the segment depends on the optical properties of the medium , with different properties for sea water , ice , and liquid scintillators that vary with the wavelength of light .    in water ,",
