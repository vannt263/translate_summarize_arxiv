    "materials having strongly correlated electrons exhibit exotic magnetic and electronic properties including superconductivity with high transition temperature,@xcite itinerant ferromagnetism , giant magnetoresistance etc . due to the existence of several competing states .",
    "recently discovered layered compounds @xmath5 [ @xmath6 rare earth element , @xmath7=transition metal element , @xmath8=pnictogen element ] have attracted attention of the condensed matter physicists for their various interesting properties when doped@xcite with electron or hole or being pressurized.@xcite like cuprates , pnictides have also two dimensional electronic structure where the crystal structure is composed of alternate stacks of @xmath9o and @xmath10 layers .",
    "the magnetic properties of la@xmath11po are of special interest with respect to the variation of @xmath11 i.e. changing the number of 3@xmath12 electrons . in case of fe ( 3@xmath13 ) and ni ( 3@xmath14 ) as @xmath11 , the oxypnictides undergo superconducting transition ( with @xmath15 lying in the range of 3 - 6 k ) , where the magnetic ordering is suppressed due to reduction of magnetic moments.@xcite for zn ( 3@xmath16 ) and mn ( 3@xmath17 ) as @xmath11 , the compounds show semiconducting and antiferromagnetic semiconducting properties respectively.@xcite in lacopo , the magnetic moment does not vanish completely due to the odd number of electrons in the 3@xmath12 orbitals ( 3@xmath18 ) , thereby showing ferromagnetic transition at 43 k , when the magnetization is measured in an external magnetic field of 0.1 t , with no superconducting transition down to 2 k.@xcite thus it is emerged that the number of 3@xmath12 electrons have a definite influence on the macroscopic properties of these type of compounds .",
    "in the present paper , we report the results of @xmath0la nmr studies in a grain aligned sample of lacopo in which @xmath4p nmr @xcite showed the presence of dominant ferromagnetic ( fm ) 2d spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic state . @xmath4p",
    "being a spin 1/2 nucleus , possesses no quadrupole moment , therefore it provides information only about the dominant magnetic interactions within the co - p plane .",
    "the non magnetic la - o plane is situated in between the two magnetic co - p planes ( fig .",
    "1[structure ] ) , with co and o atoms sitting at the center of the p and la tetrahedra respectively .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0la nmr knight shift and the spin - lattice relaxation time measurements are expected to provide additional information about the microscopic nature of the magnetism ( compared to that obtained from @xmath4p nmr ) by probing different portion of the electronic structure . furthermore , la being a quadrupolar nucleus , the nature of the local electronic charge distribution through the electrostatic hyperfine interaction parameters would be revealed .",
    "we have analyzed the magnetization data in lacopo using the self consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory of takahashi@xcite and determined the spin fluctuation parameters which are then compared with that determined from @xmath0la nmr spin - lattice relaxation data again using scr theory.@xcite we also present the results of @xmath0la nmr studies in the polycrystalline sample of lafepo ( which does not order magnetically and exhibit superconducting transition @xmath19 4 k,@xcite ) in order to compare the effect of the substitution of fe in place of co , on the electronic properties in such compounds .",
    "polycrystalline samples of lafepo and lacopo were synthesized by the method of solid state reaction  @xcite and were characterized using powder x - ray diffraction technique with cuk@xmath20 radiation at room temperature .",
    "almost all the diffraction peaks were assigned within the space group p4/nmm .",
    "weak peaks with intensity @xmath21 4% with respect to the strongest diffraction peak of lacopo were assigned as due to la@xmath22o@xmath23 , present as an impurity phase .",
    "the magnetizations ( @xmath24 ) were measured as functions of temperature ( @xmath25 ) and the magnetic fields ( @xmath26 ) using a squid magnetometer ( mpmsxl 7 t , quantum design ) .",
    "the nmr measurements were carried out in a conventional phase - coherent spectrometer ( thamway prot 4103mr ) with a 7.04 t(@xmath27 ) superconducting magnet from bruker .",
    "the spectrum was recorded by changing the frequency step by step and recording the spin echo intensity by applying a @xmath28 solid echo sequence .",
    "the temperature variation in the range 4 - 300 k was performed in an oxford continuous flow cryostat with a itc503 controller .",
    "the powder sample of lacopo was aligned in the nmr coil , by mixing the fine powders with an epoxy ( epotek-301 ) and keeping overnight in the magnetic field of 7.04 t.",
    "the variation of magnetization ( @xmath24 ) with temperature in a magnetic field of @xmath26=0.1 t shows a sharp enhancement below 50 k due to ferromagnetic ordering , as reported earlier.@xcite derivative of the @xmath24 vs @xmath25 curve provides an approximate value of @xmath29 to be 35 k ( inset of fig .",
    "2 ) . fig .",
    "2 shows the isothermal @xmath24 versus @xmath26 curves in the range 2 - 60 k. above @xmath26=2 t , the curves show a saturation in the low temperature region , and around 60 k the @xmath24 versus @xmath26 curve becomes linear , indicating that the system reached the paramagnetic state . for homogeneous itinerant ferromagnet @xmath30 where the coefficient @xmath31 is independent of temperature around @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath15 is defined as the temperature at which the spontaneous magnetization ( @xmath32 ) is zero . from the arrott plot ( @xmath33 vs @xmath34 plots ) ( fig .",
    "3 ) one can estimate @xmath15 .",
    "it is seen that the curves are convex in nature similar to that of itinerant ferromagnet lacoaso@xcite .",
    "this nature of the curves was predicted by takahashi s scr theory of spin fluctuations,@xcite where it is assumed that the sum of the zero point and the thermal spin fluctuations is conserved against @xmath25 .    in the localized limit ,",
    "zero - point spin fluctuation is negligible and the thermal spin fluctuation is constant above @xmath29 .",
    "however , in case of weakly itinerant ferromagnetic metals , the zero - point spin fluctuation mainly forms the total spin fluctuation and the thermal spin fluctuation increases with temperature above @xmath29 , which gives the value of the ratio of the effective paramagnetic moment to the saturation moment , @xmath35 greater than 1 , which is @xmath21 1 , in case of localized ferromagnet . from the @xmath32 vs @xmath25 curve ( inset of fig .",
    "3 ) the approximate value of @xmath36 , the value of @xmath32 at @xmath25=0 is obtained as 0.3 @xmath37 per co ion , which is close to the reported value.@xcite @xmath38 ( @xmath39 in @xmath37 unit ) estimated from the slope of curie - weiss plot in the range 300 -70 k is 1.49 @xmath37 .",
    "this is greater than @xmath36 signifying the itinerant character of the local spin moments .",
    "4 shows isothermal magnetization curves in the form of @xmath40 vs @xmath41 for lacopo . in itinerant ferromagnet",
    ", @xmath40 follows the relation@xcite @xmath42 at @xmath29 , where @xmath43 characterizes the width of the distribution of the static susceptibility in the wave vector ( @xmath44 ) space . @xmath40",
    "vs @xmath41 curve at @xmath29 ( inset of fig .",
    "4 ) shows not much departure from a linear fitting ( indicated by the continuous line ) , and therefore closely supports the takahashi s theory suggesting a linear behavior represented by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , when the coefficient of @xmath40 term in the landau expansion of free energy becomes zero .",
    "the value of @xmath45 ( shown in table i ) is estimated from the slope of @xmath40 vs @xmath41 curve at @xmath29 . according to the scr thoery of weak itinerant ferromagnet ( wif)@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47=0.3353@xmath48 and @xmath49 is @xmath36 in @xmath37 unit .",
    "@xmath50 which characterizes the energy width of the dynamical spin - fluctuation spectrum is obtained ( table i ) from eq .",
    "this theory is also used to evaluate the coefficient @xmath51 ( an important spin fluctuation parameter ) of @xmath40 term , in the landau expansion of free energy , which can be written as@xcite @xmath52 @xmath51 as estimated ( table i ) from eq .",
    "4 is found to be larger than that reported for lacoaso.@xcite this suggests a more localized character of the @xmath12-electrons in lacopo compared to that in lacoaso .",
    "we also verified that lacopo follows universal rhodes - wohlfarth relation@xcite between @xmath53 and @xmath29/@xmath50 viz .",
    ", @xmath54 as shown in fig .",
    "5 . according to the scr theory , @xmath29/@xmath50 = 1 in case of localized ferromagnet , but as the itinerant character sets in , the value becomes less than one . in case of lacoaso , the value of @xmath29/@xmath50 @xmath55 0.1.@xcite whereas , it is @xmath56 0.2 for lacopo as obtained from the present results .",
    "this also suggests a more localized character of the d - electrons in lacopo than in lacoaso .",
    "table i shows the obtained values of the parameters from the present magnetization study in lacopo and those reported for lacoaso@xcite for comparison .",
    ".parameters deduced from the present magnetization data in lacopo and those reported for lacoaso@xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     hence by plotting ( 1/@xmath57 versus @xmath58 ( inset of fig .",
    "9 ) , we have calculated @xmath50 from its slope .",
    "@xmath50 is related to @xmath59 , corresponding to the width in energy of the spin excitations@xcite by , @xmath60 where @xmath61 = @xmath62 with @xmath63 = 19.49 @xmath64 , corresponding to the atomic volume of co. the parameter @xmath43 is then calculated using eq .",
    "3 . spin fluctuation parameters evaluated from the @xmath0la nmr results are given in table iii along with the same determined from the magnetization data .",
    "it is to be noted that the values agree in order of magnitude . in case of mnsi , another weakly itinerant magnet ,",
    "the estimated value of @xmath50 from inelastic neutron scattering@xcite is 230 k and the same estimated from magnetic contribution to the thermal expansion coefficient@xcite is 231 k , showing a close agreement .",
    "however , the value of @xmath50 obtained from @xmath65si nmr 1/@xmath66 data@xcite is 71 k which is one order of magnitude smaller . even in the present case also ,",
    "the value of @xmath50 obtained from @xmath0la nmr in lacopo , is smaller than that obtained from the magnetization data , though they are of same order of magnitude .",
    "this finding possibly supports the argument of corti et al@xcite regarding such disagreement that in the expression for @xmath61 , @xmath63 should be the primitive cell volume and not co atomic volume , with @xmath67 close to the zone boundary .",
    "scr theory for weak itinerant ferromagnet was developed for small values of @xmath44 and @xmath68/@xmath44 and this theory tells that static susceptibility will follow cw law only for small values of @xmath44@xcite .",
    "it means that the value of @xmath44 is important in this theory .",
    "if we use primitive cell volume in place of co atomic volume then the value of @xmath67 will be smaller and may fall in the region of @xmath44 for which cw law holds .",
    "it is necessary to do inelastic neutron scattering experiment in lacopo in order to evaluate the value of @xmath59 . using this value of @xmath59 and t@xmath69 ( obtained from present nmr results )",
    "it will be possible to determine @xmath63 , which will verify whether co atomic volume should be taken or the primitive cell volume in the expression for @xmath67 .",
    "the magnetic property of the itinerant ferromagnet lacopo was investigated in the oriented ( @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 ) powder sample from @xmath0la nmr knight shift and the spin - lattice relaxation studies .",
    "the same measurements were also performed in random powder sample of lafepo for comparison .",
    "the local magnetic field at the la nuclear site is isotropic and @xmath25 independent in lafepo , while it is highly anisotropic and @xmath25 dependent in lacopo . the dominant contribution to",
    "this anisotropy arises from the electron nuclear hyperfine interaction , producing a negative spin polarization at the la electronic orbital , possibly through the rkky interaction , while the dipolar contribution to the same is positive in sign and one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "moreover , the replacement of fe by co not only lowers the symmetry of the local magnetic field but also enhances the electric field gradient at the la nuclear site .",
    "this could arise due to some modification produced in the band structure , such that the contribution to the efg from the non-@xmath70 electronic orbitals is enhanced along with a lowering in symmetry of the local magnetic field at the la nuclear site .",
    "detailed band structure calculation showing the involvement of la electronic orbitals , is necessary to understand these findings .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence of @xmath0la 1/@xmath71 in lacopo shows the existence of non - negligible 3d spin fluctuations in both the paramagnetic and the ordered state over and above the dominant 2d spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic phase , observed from the previous @xmath4p nmr relaxation data in the same oriented sample.@xcite the origin of this 3d spin fluctuations could be due to the existence of non - zero inter layer exchange interaction between the co - p planes , which is communicated through the la - o plane situated in between as shown in fig.1 . by applying the scr theory of moriya to the magnetization data of lacopo",
    ", we have also determined the different spin fluctuation parameters along with the same from la nmr relaxation data .",
    "the agreement was found to be quite satisfactory and suggests a more localized character of the 3d electrons in lacopo when compared with the same reported from the magnetization data in lacoaso . finally ,",
    "it is to be pointed out that the presence of @xmath21 4% la@xmath22o@xmath23 in the powder sample of lacopo should give rise to a signal at the reference position ( 42.37 mhz ) , which would be superimposed on the @xmath0la central transition in lacopo at 300 k. however , below 300 k , presence of any signal from la@xmath22o@xmath23 ( whose position is @xmath25 independent ) should come out from the central line of lacopo .",
    "no such signal from la@xmath22o@xmath23 was detectable throughout the whole temperature range .",
    "therefore , it would not affect the results .",
