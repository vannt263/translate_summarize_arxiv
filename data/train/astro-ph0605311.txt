    "the bright southern star @xmath0scorpii ( hd 158926 , hr 6527 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) is classified as a b2iv+b single - lined spectroscopic binary system in the bright star catalogue @xcite , but it is in fact a triple system .",
    "two recent papers by uytterhoeven and colleagues @xcite present a detailed spectroscopic study of the system based on fourteen years of data .",
    "we shall refer to these as papers i & ii . these papers also include an extensive review of the literature on @xmath0sco and here we present only a brief synopsis .",
    "the system comprises two b stars of similar mass that orbit each other with a period of approximately 1000 days ( the ` wide ' system ) .",
    "the primary is a @xmath15cephei type variable with a low mass companion that orbits the primary with a period of 6 days ( the ` close ' system ) .",
    "the spectroscopic elements for the two orbits are given in paper  i. the close binary system is eclipsing and in paper  i it is shown that this constrains the inclination to the range @xmath16 .",
    "an independent argument in paper  ii based on frequency analysis also gives the same result .",
    "paper  ii notes that the wide orbit can not be accurately determined from the spectroscopy .",
    "we report here interferometric observations made with the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) on the wide system that results in a much improved orbit .",
    "in section [ sec : susi ] we present the susi observations and the new interferometric orbit .    in section [ sec : combined ] the interferometric elements are used to determine a revised spectroscopic orbit .",
    "interferometry also provides the brightness ratio between the distant component and the primary .",
    "the mass - luminosity relation can be used to find the mass ratio , and using the spectroscopically determined mass function , the individual masses can be calculated .",
    "having determined the masses the dynamical parallax for @xmath0sco can be calculated .",
    "it differs significantly from the hipparcos parallax .",
    "following papers i & ii we use ` close ' and ` wide ' to distinguish the orbital elements associated with the 6-day and 1000-day periods seen in the spectrum of the primary . when no subscript is used the wide system is implied .    in the case of the interferometric data we follow the scheme proposed in the washington multiplicity catalog ( wmc ) @xcite .",
    "the primary will be denoted by ` a ' , the close companion by ` a ' and the wide component by ` b ' .",
    "the notation @xmath17 , for example , denotes the semimajor axis of the orbit of a relative to the primary while @xmath18 is the semimajor axis of b relative to the centre of light of the close pair .",
    "observations prior to 2004 were made at the blue wavelength of 442 nm using a bandwidth of 4 nm .",
    "the optical layout was essentially the same as the one described in davis et al .  .",
    "the data were reduced using the same procedure that was employed for the analysis of the binary system @xmath15cen @xcite .",
    "baselines of 5 , 10 and 20 metres were used . for these baselines",
    "the two b stars are essentially unresolved by susi . because of atmospheric turbulence",
    "the fringe phase carries no useful information , and susi , like most optical interferometers , measures a quantity proportional to the squared modulus of the complex degree of coherence @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the projected baseline , @xmath22 is the vector separation between the two components of the binary as seen from the earth and @xmath23 is the brightness ratio .",
    "the susi data taken with the blue beam - combining system are ` uncalibrated ' ; i.e. , no unresolved reference stars were observed to take into account the reduction in the observed fringe signal due to atmospheric and instrumental effects .",
    "the seeing conditions vary during the night , and experience has shown that modelling this by a simple linear time variation is usually adequate .",
    "we therefore assume that the observed signal will have the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hour angle of @xmath0sco . the two empirical factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 are free parameters in the model fitting procedure .",
    "the sign in equation ( [ eq : bluvis ] ) reflects the fact that in general the seeing deteriorates during the night .",
    "it should be noted that the cosine term in equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) depends on the position angle @xmath28 and the separation @xmath29 . when the raw @xmath30 data are fitted using equation ( [ eq : bluvis ] ) the resultant estimates for @xmath29 and @xmath28 are not significantly affected by the fact that the data are uncalibrated .",
    "the estimate for the brightness ratio , on the other hand , may be subject to systematic errors .",
    "the presence of a cosine in equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) means that there is a @xmath31 ambiguity in the position angle ( a two - aperture interferometer can not distinguish between @xmath22 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "this has no impact on the interpretation of the results presented here",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) does not take into account the presence of the close binary orbiting the primary . however , paper  i notes that the contribution of h@xmath33 emission from weak t tauri stars is at least 2 orders of magnitude fainter than the primary .",
    "modulation due to the faint companion will be at most 1% and generally much smaller than this .",
    "this is less than the measurement noise and consequently the effect of the t tauri component on the interferometric data will be negligible .    .",
    "the data are fitted using equation ( [ eq : bluvis ] ) and the best fit is shown .",
    "the error bars denote the formal errors of the data points .",
    "the actual uncertainties are estimated to be 2.8 times larger .",
    "the point shown as an open circle was omitted from the final fit.,width=317 ]    the binary star measures were estimated from the @xmath30 data using essentially the same procedure described by davis et al . .",
    "the data from each night were fitted using equation ( [ eq : bluvis ] ) and the data for a typical night are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "the formal error for each data point in general underestimates the actual scatter because the seeing varies throughout the night .",
    "having found the best fit to the data the formal errors are rescaled to make @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the weighted sum of the squared residuals and @xmath36 is the number of degrees of freedom . in effect , we assume that the actual uncertainties obey gaussian statistics and all the data points are similarly affected by seeing ( in the example shown in fig .  [ fig : example ] the scaling factor was 2.8 ) . using the rescaled weighting factors",
    "monte carlo simulation is then used to determine the uncertainties in the fitting parameters .",
    "the assumption that all the points are equally affected by seeing is not strictly true , but if the seeing does not change dramatically during the night this assumption is , on average , realistic .",
    "the seeing is continually measured and logged , and points that are badly affected by seeing are excluded from the final fit .    a completely independent analysis was performed using simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "simulated annealing is more likely to converge on the true minimum of @xmath35 rather than on a local minimum , unlike steepest descent methods .",
    "the simulated annealing results did not differ significantly from those obtained by our standard method and we are confident that the values of @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath15 and their uncertainties that are given in table [ table : susidata ] are the best fit to each night s data .",
    "the separation @xmath29 and related quantities are all expressed in milliarcseconds ( mas ) .    [",
    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,<,>,>,^ \" , ]      the dynamical parallax is @xmath37^{1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the combined mass of the primary ( a ) and the close companion ( a ) and @xmath39 the mass of the b component .",
    "we have used the estimates given in table  [ table : masses ] and the interferometric value of @xmath40 ( table  [ table : elements ] ) to find the distance to @xmath0sco : @xmath41    our distance is smaller than the hipparcos value of @xmath11pc @xcite by nearly a factor of two ( i.e. , 2.5 times the hipparcos standard deviation ) .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that the motion in binary systems can significantly bias hipparcos parallaxes and a similar phenomenon has been observed with @xmath15cen @xcite .",
    "the revised parallax may have implications regarding the membership of @xmath0sco in the scorpius - centaurus - lupus - crux complex of ob associations .",
    "brown & verscheuren suggested that it was a member of the upper scorpius ( us ) association , but de zeeuw et al .   did not include @xmath0sco as a secure member of the us association based on an analysis of hipparcos positions , parallaxes and proper motions .",
    "the revised parallax corresponds to the lower centaurus crux ( lcc ) association , which lies at a distance of @xmath42 pc .",
    "the galactic coordinates of @xmath0sco , however , still exclude it as a definite member of the association .",
    "observations with susi have been used to establish an interferometric orbit for @xmath0sco . the accuracy of the period , epoch of periastron , eccentricity and argument of periastron",
    "are significantly better than those previously found ( paper  i ) .",
    "we have combined the interferometric and spectroscopic elements to provide an orbital solution which is consistent with both the interferometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "the inclination of the orbit for the wide component is consistent with that previously found for the close companion , and the eccentricity of its orbit is quite low .",
    "this is strong evidence that the system was formed from a common accretion disk rather than through tidal capture .",
    "the brightness ratio allows the mass ratio of the two b stars to be estimated from the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "the estimated mass ratio of @xmath43 agrees with the masses determined by the synthetic spectrum analysis presented in paper  i. the limiting factor in the determination of the individual masses and the semimajor axis is clearly the large uncertainties of the rv values .",
    "this is due to our inability to disentangle the contributions of the primary and wide companion to the lines in the overall spectrum .",
    "while sophisticated disentangling methodology is available in the literature , e.g.  hadrava , its application to single - lined binaries has not yet been achieved to our knowledge . in the case of @xmath0sco ,",
    "the @xmath15cep oscillations are an additional factor that complicates the disentangling .",
    "nevertheless , we have taken a conservative approach to estimate the mass ranges from the spectroscopic orbital rv and we have constrained them further from spectrum synthesis results and from requiring equal ages and the appropriate brightness ratio from the susi data . in this way , we obtained a relative precision of about 12% for the masses of both @xmath0 sco a and b. masses of b - type stars are not generally known to such a precision .",
    "accurate mass estimates of pulsating massive stars are important for asteroseismic investigations of these stars . indeed , the oscillation frequencies of well identified modes in principle allow the fine - tuning of the physics of the evolutionary models ( see aerts et al .   for an example ) . for this to be effective",
    "when only a few oscillation modes have been identified we need an independent high - precision estimate of the effective temperature and of the mass of the star .",
    "this is generally not available for single b stars .",
    "the @xmath0sco aa system is one of the bright close binaries with a @xmath15cep component and it is only the second one , after @xmath15cen , for which a full coverage of the orbit with interferometric data is available .",
    "the results presented in this paper therefore constitute a fruitful starting point for seismic modelling of the primary of @xmath0 sco , particularly now that the wire satellite has provided several more oscillation frequencies compared to those found in paper  ii @xcite    the mass estimates , when combined with the period and angular semimajor axis found from the interferometric orbit , allow the dynamical parallax to be calculated .",
    "we find the distance to the @xmath0sco system of @xmath44 pc , which is almost a factor of two smaller than the hipparcos distance of @xmath11 pc .",
    "the reason for the large discrepancy is almost certainly due to the b component since it is of comparable brightness to the primary and the orbital period is approximately three years .",
    "the fact that many of the b stars in the sco - cen association are multiple systems suggests that the hipparcos parallaxes for these stars must be used with care .",
