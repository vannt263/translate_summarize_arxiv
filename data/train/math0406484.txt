    "the steepest descent method for asymptotic analysis of matrix riemann - hilbert problems was introduced by deift and zhou in 1993 @xcite .",
    "a matrix riemann - hilbert problem is specified by giving a triple @xmath1 consisting of an oriented contour @xmath2 in the complex @xmath3-plane , a matrix function @xmath4 which is usually taken to be continuous except at self - intersection points of @xmath2 where a certain compatibility condition is required , and a normalization condition @xmath5 as @xmath6 . if @xmath2 is not bounded , certain asymptotic conditions are required of @xmath7 in order to have compatibility with the normalization condition .",
    "consider an analytic function @xmath8 taking continuous boundary values @xmath9 ( respectively @xmath10 ) on @xmath2 from the left ( respectively right ) .",
    "the riemann - hilbert problem @xmath1 is then to find such a matrix @xmath11 satisfying the normalization condition @xmath5 as @xmath6 and the jump condition @xmath12 whenever @xmath3 is a non - self - intersection point of @xmath2 ( so the left and right boundary values are indeed well - defined ) .",
    "the steepest descent method of deift and zhou applies to certain riemann - hilbert problems where the jump matrix @xmath13 depends on an auxiliary control parameter , and is a method for extracting asymptotic properties of the solution @xmath11 ( and indeed proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions along the way ) when the control parameter tends to a singular limit of interest .",
    "the original method put forth in @xcite bears a striking resemblance to the well - known steepest descent method or saddle point method for analyzing contour integrals with exponential integrands . a distinguished point on @xmath2",
    "is identified ( analogous to a point of stationary phase ) and an explicit change of variables of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a piecewise analytic matrix is introduced in the vicinity of this point and it is observed that ( i ) the matrix @xmath16 satisfies an equivalent riemann - hilbert problem with a new contour @xmath17 and a new jump matrix @xmath18 , and ( ii ) the jump matrix @xmath19 converges to the identity matrix in the singular limit of interest for all @xmath3 bounded away from the stationary phase point .",
    "one therefore expects that a good approximation to @xmath20 can be constructed by an explicit local analysis near the stationary phase point . with the explicit local approximant @xmath21 constructed ,",
    "one uses it in a final change of variables @xmath22 and observes ( i ) that @xmath23 satisfies a riemann - hilbert problem with a possibly new contour @xmath24 and a new explicit jump matrix @xmath25 and ( ii ) that the new jump matrix @xmath26 is now _ uniformly _ close to the identity matrix in the limit of interest .",
    "this allows one to construct @xmath23 by iteration of certain singular integral equations that are equivalent to any given riemann - hilbert problem , and to show that @xmath23 is uniformly close to the identity matrix in any region bounded away from @xmath24 . with additional work it may in some circumstances",
    "be shown that @xmath23 is close to the identity uniformly right up to the contour @xmath24 ( this usually requires more detailed information about the jump matrix ) . in this way , one obtains a formula @xmath27 for the solution that can be used to compute _ directly _ an asymptotic expansion of @xmath28 valid in the singular limit of interest .",
    "since the introduction of the steepest descent method for riemann - hilbert problems , there have been several key developments . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "a technique was established in which one makes a change of variables involving a matrix constructed from a single unknown scalar function @xmath29 analytic in @xmath30 .",
    "the transformation modifies the jump matrix in a way involving the boundary values @xmath31 taken on @xmath2 .",
    "one then chooses relations between the boundary values of @xmath29 such that the transformed riemann - hilbert problem becomes asymptotically simple",
    ". the desired conditions amount to a _",
    "scalar _ riemann - hilbert problem for @xmath29 , which is easily solved in many circumstances .",
    "a crucial feature of this method is that the dominant contribution to the solution typically comes from subintervals of the contour @xmath2 of finite length rather than from isolated points .",
    "here we therefore see an important difference between singular limits of matrix riemann - hilbert problems and evaluation of saddle - point integrals . in the contributing intervals the transformed jump matrix",
    "has a factorization ( see , , and below ) whose factors admit analytic continuation to the left and right of each such interval . a further change of variables based on this analytic factorization is carried out in lens - shaped regions surrounding each contributing interval . ultimately , a model problem is solved ( typically in terms of riemann theta functions of genus related to the number of contributing intervals ) and along with local analysis near the endpoints of the intervals a model for @xmath11 is built and compared with @xmath11 to obtain a riemann - hilbert problem for the error @xmath23 . when the method is successful , the jump matrix for @xmath23 is uniformly close to the identity and thus @xmath32 may be constructed via iteration of integral equations .",
    "significantly , the conditions imposed on the boundary values of @xmath29 can often be viewed as the euler - lagrange conditions for a certain variational problem ( see @xcite as well as @xcite and appendix  [ app : potential ] of this paper ) .",
    "a further development emerged from problems in which it was recognized that no appropriate function @xmath29 can be found relative to the given contour @xmath2 . in @xcite and later in @xcite it was shown how analyticity of the jump matrix could be exploited to effectively deform arcs of the contour @xmath2 to alternative locations in the complex plane such that the jump matrix maintains the same functional form ; specific locations of the arcs are determined such that there exists an appropriate function @xmath29 as above .",
    "these selected arcs are the closest relatives in the noncommutative theory to the paths of steepest descent from saddle points in the asymptotic theory of contour integrals .",
    "the contour selection principle was also encoded into a variational problem in @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite , new techniques have been added to the framework of the steepest descent method that are adapted for determining the asymptotic contribution to the solution of a coalescence of a large number of poles in the matrix unknown ( this is strictly speaking not a riemann - hilbert problem in the sense described above due to the polar singularities , however the problem is first converted into a standard riemann - hilbert problem by explicit transformations ) .",
    "the key idea here is to exploit certain analytic interpolants of given residues at the poles .    for the fundamentally nonlinear cases in which the dominant contribution comes from subintervals of a contour",
    ", a central feature is that the analytical methods rely on piecewise analyticity of the given jump matrix and of the boundary values of the scalar function @xmath29 .",
    "for some of the cases of long - time asymptotics of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations @xcite , as well as the recent long time asymptotic analysis for perturbations of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , the dominant contribution comes from isolated points of the contour @xmath2 , and while analyticity is not fundamental , the asymptotic calculations proceed by an approximation argument , in which an analytic part is deformed away , and a ( small ) residual contribution is handled by technical and analytical prowess .",
    "the approximation argument is delicate and requires detailed analysis that depends sensitively on the geometry of the particular contour @xmath2 .",
    "far from being a mere pursuit of abstraction , a simple asymptotic technique that applies to riemann - hilbert problems regardless of whether the jump matrix is analytic or not would have immediate application in a number of important areas .",
    "for example , a unified treatment of the asymptotic theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line with general nonanalytic weights would allow the resolution of universality conjectures from random matrix theory in the most natural and general context ( see @xcite for the analytic case , and @xcite for an application of the @xmath0 steepest descent method described in this paper to the nonanalytic but convex case ) .",
    "as another example , if it were possible to treat systematically problems with a large number of poles that accumulate in a very regular but nonanalytic fashion , then the important problem of semiclassical asymptotics for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation with general nonanalytic initial data could begin to be addressed .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new generalization of the steepest descent method for riemann - hilbert problems that applies in absence of analyticity of the jump matrix , and yet does not depend on an approximation argument for the jump matrix . while we believe that the ideas we will develop in this paper are useful in very general contexts , we have chosen to focus on a particular application of the steepest descent method in order to demonstrate the technique .",
    "as mentioned above , after changing variables using an appropriate scalar function @xmath29 , the jump matrix is converted into a form that is well - suited for further asymptotic analysis .",
    "a common `` target '' form for the jump matrix in certain arcs of @xmath2 is the following form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a real parameter along the arc of @xmath2 which for simplicity here we assume lies on the real axis ( for a representation see figure  [ fig : intro ] ) , @xmath35 is the control parameter tending to zero in the singular limit of interest , and @xmath36 is a strictly increasing real function of @xmath34 that is related to the boundary values of @xmath29 on @xmath2 .",
    "suppose @xmath16 is the unknown satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "with the assumption of analyticity of @xmath36 , one may transform the riemann - hilbert problem by introducing as a new unknown a matrix @xmath38 defined in terms of @xmath16 by the following scheme : in some region lying on the minus side of the arc ( the region labeled @xmath39 in figure  [ fig : intro ] ) , set @xmath40 and in some region lying on the plus side of the arc ( the region labeled @xmath41 in figure  [ fig : intro ] ) , set @xmath42 elsewhere , set @xmath43 . on has thus introduced two new jump contours , one on either side of the arc ( these are the two dashed lines in figure  [ fig : intro ] ) .",
    "however , the monotonicity of the real analytic function @xmath36 implies via the cauchy - riemann equations that the induced jump matrix relating the boundary values of @xmath44 on these two contours is exponentially close to the identity matrix in the limit @xmath45 . on the original arc",
    ", the matrix @xmath38 satisfies the constant jump relation @xmath46 which can be subsequently dealt with in terms of special functions . in this paper , we show how this procedure can be carried out effectively when one does not have the option of extending @xmath36 from the contour @xmath2 because it is not assumed to be an analytic function .",
    "we choose to extend @xmath36 in a way that does not assume any analyticity ( see below ) .",
    "the price that must be paid is that the analogue of the matrix @xmath44 above is no longer analytic in the regions to the left and right of the arc ; therefore this matrix can not be the solution of any riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "it can , however , be the solution of a matrix @xmath0 problem ( or more generally a mixed riemann - hilbert-@xmath0 problem ) .",
    "it is into this framework that we extend the steepest descent method .",
    "this explains the terminology of the `` @xmath0 steepest descent method '' .",
    "as the fundamental contour @xmath2 in this paper is the unit circle @xmath47 , we can now be very specific about what we mean by an extension of a nonanalytic function in this context .",
    "suppose that @xmath48 is a @xmath49 function , @xmath50 .",
    "then , we define an extension operator @xmath51 as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the standard polar coordinates for @xmath54 .",
    "note that this indeed defines a continuous extension to any annulus @xmath55 where @xmath56 since @xmath57 .",
    "also , since @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the fundamental differential operators of complex variable theory are represented in polar coordinates as @xmath60 and therefore we see that if @xmath61 is lipschitz , then in particular it has a derivative almost everywhere that is uniformly bounded , and we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 both holding for all @xmath64 and almost all @xmath65 ( these formulae hold at every point of the plane if @xmath66 is of class @xmath67 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath68 vanishes to order @xmath69 as @xmath70 uniformly in @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath48 is analytic for all @xmath71 , then the infinite series @xmath72 converges uniformly in some annulus containing the unit circle @xmath73 and represents the unique analytic extension of @xmath48 .    generally speaking , riemann - hilbert problems with rapidly oscillatory jump matrices are equivalent to systems of singular integral equations with cauchy kernel and rapidly oscillatory densities .",
    "such equations can in principle be analyzed asymptotically @xcite .",
    "this approach requires delicate arguments of harmonic analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 steepest descent method we will develop in this paper avoids such complicated reasoning . indeed , by extending contour integration into integration over two - dimensional regions , the cauchy kernel becomes less singular , and the analysis becomes correspondingly more straightforward .    in the analytic case",
    "described briefly above , the asymptotic analysis is in general complicated by the fact that the procedure is valid in the neighborhood of certain intervals of @xmath2 , and it turns out that a different analysis must be carried out in the vicinity of the endpoints of the intervals . the same would be expected to be true in the general nonanalytic case .",
    "in order to have the clearest possible presentation , we have chosen to describe in this paper the @xmath0 steepest descent method in the context of a problem where there are nontrivial cases without endpoint issues , namely the asymptotic behavior of polynomials orthogonal with respect to weights on the unit circle . while the presence of endpoints complicates the analysis , they do not present an insurmountable obstruction , and the reader is referred to @xcite for a description of the more general theory .",
    "let @xmath74 be an integrable @xmath75-periodic function satisfying @xmath76 for almost all @xmath71 .",
    "for two complex - valued functions @xmath48 and @xmath77 there is an associated inner product @xmath78 this inner product leads to a system @xmath79 of orthogonal polynomials in the complex variable @xmath3 : @xmath80 and the defining relation is the orthonormality condition @xmath81 here the polynomials @xmath82 are considered as complex - valued functions of @xmath71 by restriction to the unit circle : @xmath83 .",
    "the constants @xmath84 have the interpretation of normalization constants , and the corresponding system @xmath85 of monic orthogonal polynomials is defined by rescaling : @xmath86 the orthogonal polynomials satisfy recurrence relations of the form @xmath87 for @xmath88 . here",
    ", the complex constants @xmath89 are the _ recurrence coefficients _ associated with the weight @xmath90 ( also known as the _ schur parameters _ or _ verblunsky coefficients _ ) . by setting @xmath91 in the first equation of",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath92    for a general discussion of properties of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle , see chapter xii of szeg s monograph @xcite , in which ( among other things ) the asymptotic behavior of @xmath93 for @xmath94 is discussed .",
    "the extraction of asymptotic formulae for quantities related to the orthogonal polynomials of large degree with a fixed weight @xmath90 on the unit circle is the type of asymptotic problem in the theory of general orthogonal polynomials ( that is , beyond particular cases involving classical special functions ) for which results have been known for the longest time .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that if @xmath95 happens to be a positive trigonometric polynomial , then there is a closed - form expression for the orthonormal polynomial @xmath82 that is convenient for analysis , as long as @xmath96 is sufficiently large compared to the degree of @xmath95 .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in other words , for certain special fixed weights @xmath74 the asymptotic formulae one obtains become _ exact _ as long as @xmath96 is large enough .",
    "this leads to a general strategy for asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle based on approximating an arbitrary given positive function @xmath95 by positive trigonometric polynomials .",
    "the asymptotics described in the monograph of szeg are of a rather general character and hold whenever @xmath97 is an integrable real valued function . in the years since the origin of szeg s methods , there have been many further developments in the asymptotic theory .",
    "these developments move both in the direction of generalizing the class of weights for which the szeg asymptotics are valid ( perhaps in a weaker form ) and also in the direction of trading generality of the weight for detail of the asymptotics .",
    "it seems that certain problems remain difficult to treat by these methods ; in particular , it is difficult to verify convergence in a uniform sense , and it is difficult to characterize the detailed asymptotic behavior of zeros .",
    "there is a vast literature on this subject ; we refer the interested reader to the memoir of nevai @xcite and the forthcoming monograph of simon @xcite .    beyond being a source of classical information about orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle ,",
    "simon s monograph describes a different viewpoint of the theory of these polynomials .",
    "namely , simon and his school have made great progress by exploiting the connection between orthogonal polynomials and spectral theory for operators that encode the recurrence relations that all orthogonal polynomials satisfy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this theory is capable of establishing a number of very general results relevant to asymptotics in the limit of large degree .",
    "an important point is that the hypotheses required to establish results of this kind involve assumptions about the asymptotic behavior of the sequence @xmath89 of recurrence coefficients .",
    "indeed , the fundamental problem of spectral theory in this context is the construction of the spectral measure @xmath98 from the finite difference operator involving the recurrence coefficients @xmath89 .    on the other hand , the recovery of the polynomials @xmath79 and of the recurrence coefficients @xmath89 from the spectral measure @xmath98 is the fundamental problem of inverse spectral theory .",
    "a general approach to asymptotic problems in the theory of orthogonal polynomials in which the measure of orthogonality is the given data therefore involves the translation of the orthogonality conditions into the conditions making up a riemann - hilbert problem for sectionally analytic matrices .",
    "a riemann - hilbert formulation for polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure on the unit circle was described in @xcite and follows closely the well - known riemann - hilbert formulation for polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure on @xmath99 discovered in @xcite . in @xcite , and in a number of papers which followed ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the polynomial of degree @xmath96 orthogonal with respect to a specific family of weights of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 was studied in the limit @xmath102 .",
    "note that this is a joint limit as the degree @xmath96 of the polynomial in question appears in the measure of orthogonality as well ; see ",

    "deift used polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure on the unit circle to give an example of his theory of integrable operators .",
    "specifically , he introduced a one - parameter family of positive , analytic functions @xmath103 and related solutions of riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : m ] in   [ sec : ops ] below ( with @xmath74 replaced by @xmath103 ) to toeplitz determinants .",
    "the @xmath94 asymptotic behavior of the corresponding solution @xmath104 to riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : m ] then yields asymptotics for the associated toeplitz determinants . exploiting the analyticity of @xmath103 ,",
    "deift outlined how one obtains an asymptotic description for @xmath105 .",
    "the calculations in we will present in   [ sec : strong ] may be viewed as complementary to this asymptotic calculation of @xcite , in that we will establish asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials under the much weaker assumption that @xmath74 is a continuous function satisfying a lipschitz condition .",
    "furthermore , we show how the error estimates depend on smoothness properties of @xmath74 .",
    "the polynomials orthogonal with respect to a weight given on the unit circle in the complex plane can be characterized in terms of the solution of a matrix riemann - hilbert problem in which the contour @xmath2 is the unit circle . in ",
    "[ sec : ops ] we describe this riemann - hilbert problem , and then in   [ sec : strong ] and   [ sec : varying ] we study the singular limit in which the degree of the polynomials tends to infinity . in ",
    "[ sec : strong ] we consider the weight function to be held fixed as the degree tends to infinity , while in   [ sec : varying ] we study the joint limit when the degree becomes large while the weight function is exponentially varied .",
    "a summary of the relevant logarithmic potential theory referred to in   [ sec : varying ] is given in appendices  [ app : potential ] and [ app : compare ] .",
    "the key results we obtain in the fixed weights case are described in   [ sec : strongasymptoticspi ] . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the uniform nature of the asymptotics we obtain is new to the field , as is our detailed characterization of the zeros . while there",
    "exist several classical methods available for the asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with fixed weight function @xmath74 , with the degree @xmath96 of the polynomial in question tending to infinity , this problem is the ideal context in which to introduce the @xmath0 steepest descent method .    on the other hand , the asymptotic behavior of polynomials orthogonal with respect to a varying weight on the unit circle , considered in ",
    "[ sec : varying ] , is more challenging to obtain by more classical techniques .",
    "the results we obtain with the use of the @xmath0 steepest descent method are stated in   [ sec : asymptoticspids ] .",
    "a point we wish to emphasize is that with the use of the @xmath0 steepest descent method , the analysis in the varying weights case is no more difficult than in the fixed weights case .",
    "this fact distinguishes the @xmath0 steepest descent method from more classical techniques .      throughout , we assume a fixed norm @xmath106 on @xmath107 matrices . for @xmath108 ,",
    "we use the following induced norm on sufficiently smooth matrix functions @xmath109 @xmath110 here @xmath34 and @xmath111 are cartesian coordinates in @xmath54 . for @xmath112",
    ", we may apply this norm on all functions @xmath113 in the space @xmath114 , whereas for @xmath115 we may apply this norm to a subset of functions @xmath113 in the space @xmath116 of functions with lipschitz continuous mixed partial derivatives of all orders up to and including @xmath117 .",
    "the finiteness of the norm indicates the uniformity of the lipschitz condition . since for functions @xmath113 in the class @xmath116",
    "the mixed partial derivatives of order @xmath118 exist almost everywhere , the condition @xmath119 can be equivalently expressed as saying that @xmath113 has all derivatives of total order at most @xmath118 in the space @xmath114 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath120 and @xmath121 for spaces of functions respectively in @xmath116 and @xmath114 that vanish identically for @xmath122 large enough ( that is , outside some annulus ) .    for functions",
    "@xmath123 defined on the circle @xmath47 ( that is , @xmath124 is defined for @xmath125 ) , we also say that @xmath124 is of class @xmath126 if the periodic extension of @xmath124 to @xmath127 has @xmath128 lipschitz continuous derivatives , or equivalently , has @xmath129 derivatives in @xmath130 .",
    "a suitable norm for such functions is given by @xmath131 satisfying @xmath132 , @xmath133    if @xmath123 satisfies a hlder continuity condition , there exists a unique function @xmath134 , analytic for @xmath135 , decaying as @xmath6 , and taking hlder continuous boundary values on @xmath136 , such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 is the average value of @xmath124 .",
    "thus , @xmath139 is the negative frequency component of the fourier series for @xmath123 : @xmath140 and we have @xmath141 we also introduce the function @xmath142 by the formula @xmath143 note that @xmath144 and @xmath124 are functions that are related by the cauchy transform .    throughout the paper",
    "we will use a `` bump '' function @xmath145 $ ] with the properties that @xmath146 is infinitely differentiable , @xmath147 for @xmath148 , and @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "consider the contour @xmath2 illustrated in figure  [ fig : circle ] .",
    "let @xmath96 be a positive integer .",
    "relative to the contour @xmath2 we pose , for each @xmath88 , the following riemann - hilbert problem for a @xmath107 matrix @xmath151 .",
    "find a @xmath107 matrix @xmath152 with the properties :    * * analyticity .",
    "* @xmath152 is analytic for @xmath153 , and takes continuous boundary values @xmath154 , @xmath155 as @xmath156 tends to @xmath3 with @xmath136 and @xmath157 , @xmath158 . * * jump condition . *",
    "the boundary values are connected by the relation @xmath159 * * normalization . *",
    "the matrix @xmath152 is normalized at @xmath160 as follows : @xmath161    [ rhp : m ]    suppose that the positive weight function @xmath74 satisfies a uniform hlder condition @xmath162 for some @xmath163 $ ] and with some @xmath164 independent of @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "then riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : m ] has a unique solution for each integer @xmath167 , namely if @xmath168 , @xmath169 and if @xmath170 , @xmath171 in particular , @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath174 . here , @xmath175 is the sequence of monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight @xmath90 and the inner product , and @xmath89 is the sequence of associated recurrence coefficients ( see ) while @xmath176 is the sequence of associated normalization constants .",
    "[ prop : m ]    if @xmath170 , then the riemann - hilbert problem is triangular with identity asymptotics and is trivially solved in closed form by a cauchy integral , yielding .",
    "thus from now on we consider @xmath174 .",
    "the uniqueness of the solution for @xmath174 can be seen from the following argument .",
    "continuity of the boundary values taken on @xmath2 implies that the ratio of any two solutions of riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : m ] is an entire function of @xmath3 that tends to the identity matrix as @xmath6 .",
    "uniqueness thus follows by liouville s theorem .    to derive , first note that if @xmath151 solves riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : m ] , then the first column of @xmath152 must be analytic throughout the @xmath3-plane . from the normalization condition ( [ eq : mnorm ] )",
    "it is then clear that @xmath177 is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath96 while @xmath178 is a polymomial of degree at most @xmath179 ( the leading coefficient of @xmath178 is not determined from the normalization condition alone ) .",
    "the jump condition for the second column reads @xmath180 in particular , since @xmath74 satisfies a hlder condition , we may express @xmath181 as a cauchy - type integral using ( [ eq : seccoljump ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath182 and the normalization condition ( [ eq : mnorm ] ) then requires that this cauchy integral be of order @xmath183 as @xmath6 for each fixed @xmath184 . expanding the cauchy kernel in a geometric series",
    "we see that the following conditions must be satisfied @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "since @xmath187 for an angular coordinate @xmath71 on the contour @xmath188 , this proves that @xmath189 is orthogonal to the monomials @xmath190 , @xmath3 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 with respect to the inner product .",
    "the existence of such a monic polynomial of degree @xmath96 follows from the gram - schmidt algorithm .",
    "thus , @xmath194 , the @xmath96th monic orthogonal polynomial with respect to the weight @xmath74 on the unit circle .",
    "a similar argument applies to the second row of @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , @xmath178 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath179 . using ( [ eq : seccoljump ] ) we may express @xmath195 as a cauchy integral : @xmath196 and then the normalization condition ( [ eq : mnorm ] ) requires that @xmath197 as @xmath6 .",
    "expanding the cauchy kernel in a geometric series , one sees that @xmath178 is required to satisfy the following conditions : @xmath198 equivalently , these relations may be written in the form @xmath199 clearly , the degree @xmath179 polynomial @xmath200 is orthogonal to the monomials @xmath201 with respect to the inner product @xmath202 , and the normalization condition then fixes the leading coefficient : @xmath203 . in other words",

    "thus , the conditions of riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : m ] serve to define the orthogonal polynomials as an alternative to other representations that may be available , possibly including explicit contour integral formulae ( for special families of weights ) .",
    "riemann - hilbert problems like this one frequently arise as a consequence of the application of the fourier transform or @xmath3-transform to certain types of linear integral equations ( _ i.e. _ the wiener - hopf technique , see @xcite ) . reversing this sort of reasoning",
    ", the representation of the orthogonal polynomials in terms of riemann - hilbert problem  [ rhp : m ] immediately yields integral equations for certain auxiliary unknowns .",

    "<S> we develop a new asymptotic method for the analysis of matrix riemann - hilbert problems . </S>",
    "<S> our method is a generalization of the steepest descent method first proposed by deift and zhou ; however our method systematically handles jump matrices that need not be analytic . the essential technique is to introduce nonanalytic extensions of certain functions appearing in the jump matrix , and to therefore convert the riemann - hilbert problem into a @xmath0 problem . </S>",
    "<S> we use our method to study several asymptotic problems of polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure given on the unit circle , obtaining new detailed uniform convergence results , and for some classes of nonanalytic weights , complete information about the asymptotic behavior of the individual zeros . </S>"
