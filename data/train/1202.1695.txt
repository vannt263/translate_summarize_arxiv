    "it is well known that several phenomena pertinent to spin-@xmath0 systems can not be described in terms of classical variables although to some extent a geometric terminology may be applied to a spin state of a single electron which is customary presented on the bloch sphere , where the polar and azimuthal angles can be viewed as the euler angles of a unit vector pointing along the spin direction .",
    "still , within the framework of standard quantum mechanics there is no answer to the questions like : how could one imagine spin properties of an entangled electron pair in terms of classical variables ?",
    "the question is related to the problem of quantum entanglement , which is a rather mysterious concept and has remained so since it was first introduced by schr \" odinger back in 1935 . despite this , with the recent surge in interest stimulated by quantum information processing @xcite and quantum sensing below the quantum limit @xcite",
    ", discussions about the meaning of entanglement and how it might be visualized beyond the standard quantum mechanics have once more come to the fore @xcite . in this context",
    "can also be set recent intense exchange of views whether the wavefunction is physically real and can be directly measured or represents only a statistical tool that reflects our ignorance of the particles being measured @xcite .    quantum entanglement is strongly related to the discussion of locality in quantum mechanics and with the introduction of bell s inequality also to the question of the existence of hidden variables @xcite . in order to set experimentally observable boundaries to various hidden variable theories several other inequalities have been introduced @xcite .",
    "the outcome of numerous experimental tests of such inequalities in the last three decades performed on two - particle systems ruled out all local hidden variable approaches , although it seems that non - locality concept itself is not sufficient to be consistent with quantum experiments @xcite .",
    "however , for multipartite entangled states local hidden variable models can be introduced such that the violation of most of the bell - type inequalities does not imply and new inequalities have to be established @xcite .    in view of the fact that quantum entanglement is not an observable according to the usual rules of quantum mechanics , it does not have a direct classical analogue .",
    "however , some insight can be given by a description based on the pilot - wave approach of de broglie @xcite and later developed by bohm @xcite  where an effective non - local potential is introduced along with hidden variables .",
    "this theory is manifestly non - local , _",
    "i.e. _ , non - local potentials represent non - local action which does not get small with spatial distance between the particles and this is the key ingredient which guarantees predictions in accordance with standard quantum mechanics . while it seems that such an introduction of non - local variables does not lead to new predictions ",
    "it might turn out to be interesting in the context of possible device independent analysis of entangled systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can ask questions related to pre - existing properties of the system ; explicitly , what each individual particle in the observed system is doing prior performing the measurement .",
    "since the introduction of the bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics it has been in detail explored how this approach leads to outcome predictions of various experiments identical to the results of standard quantum mechanics , and gives due to its nature , additionally also the interpretation of the motion of particles in terms of particular coordinates  commonly termed as the bohm hidden variables . after the establishment",
    ", the bohm formalism was extended from original single spinless particles to many - body fermionic or bosonic systems @xcite and also to the quantum field theory , including creation and annihilation of particles @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown how the born - rule probability densities of non - relativistic quantum mechanics emerge naturally from the particle dynamics of de broglie - bohm theory @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of several typically quantum experiments was developed , for example , for the double slit experiments or tunneling of particles through barriers @xcite , the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , and stern - gerlach experiments @xcite . the bohmian theory in terms of well - defined individual particle trajectories with continuously variable spin vectors",

    "are two state systems and the formal bohm approach is consistently extended to spin-@xmath0 systems with non - relativistic formalism based on the pauli equation @xcite , causal rigid rotor theory @xcite , via spinor wave functions @xcite , the bohm - dirac model for entangled electrons @xcite , by clifford algebra approach to schr \" odinger @xcite or relativistic dirac particles @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the question of the visualization of the angular momenta  spins  of a system of two entangled particles by the approach of the causal interpretation of a system of two spin-@xmath0 particles as introduced by holland @xcite where the starting point is the mapping between the quantum rigid rotor and a spinning top in the presence of a quantum potential .",
    "in particular , we apply this ontological formalism to the case of a two - particle state @xmath1 where for the sake of convenience we use spin-@xmath0 notation where @xmath2 corresponds to the state of the system when the first particle ( qubit ) is in the `` up '' state , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the direction of the @xmath3-axis and the second qubit is in the state `` down '' .",
    "the generalization to states spanned by @xmath4 and @xmath5 or to systems represented as mixed states is possible , but it is not considered here .",
    "qubits are not restricted to real spin of electrons and may be realized by any appropriate two state quantum system , as are for example flux qubits in superconducting rings @xcite , charge pseudo - spin of electron pairs in double quantum dots @xcite , two flying qubits in quantum point contacts @xcite , entangled photon pairs @xcite , or even most recently studied two - qubit composite systems @xcite .",
    "the causal approach considered here has been introduced more than two decades ago but exact solutions are known only for the case of a single qubit and for some properties of a qubit pair in the singlet state .",
    "it is also known that the bell inequalities are violated in this formalism and recently the quantum entanglement of a qubit pair was linked to a particular motion of angular momenta in the bohmian space of hidden variables in a way which is entirely missed in the usual quantum mechanical approach @xcite .",
    "the problem of the motion of two entangled rotors in the bohmian space of hidden variables can be efficiently treated numerically , but the author is not aware of any quantitative investigation of this problem .",

    "it is well known that bohmian and standard approach of quantum mechanics are isomorphic regarding the prediction of experimental outcomes therefore the equality of spin - spin correlations in both approaches apparently is not a surprise .",
    "however , one should remark , that the inequality eq .",
    "( [ chsh ] ) is derived under the assumption of discreteness of the outcome of polarization measurements , while in the present bohmian analysis the spin of rotors and the corresponding projections can take any value .",
    "more importantly , @xmath289 corresponds to instant correlations of an undisturbed rotor pair , _ prior _ to accomplished measurement , not to the probabilities for particular outcomes of discrete values obtained after the measurement of spin ( such probabilities are trivially identical in all approaches ) .",
    "therefore , although the correlators of the continuously distributed bohmian angular momenta are identical to the quantum counterparts , those momenta are not directly related to the results of quantum measurements of spin projections of individual qubits , but during the process of the polarization measurement the entangled rotors adiabatically develop the measured discrete spin values from pre - measurement distributions of continuous angular momenta .",
    "this result resembles the findings of an alternative analysis of stern - gerlach experiments or einstein - podolsky - rosen spin correlations where de broglie - bohm causal predictions of experimental outcomes are identical to standard quantum mechanics results @xcite .",

    "the main motivation was the analysis of entanglement aspects of a qubit pair , in particular the exploration of the background of the angular momenta dynamics leading to specific unison motion for a perfectly entangles qubit pair @xcite which is also the source of the violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "the main properties of two entangled qubits and the results presented in the paper can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) two entangled qubits represented by the quantum state eq .",

    "\\(ii ) the ensemble average cosine of this angle is to an excellent approximation given by @xmath290 .",
    "this means that for perfectly entangled states , @xmath217 , all pairs of momenta in the ensemble form an equal angle @xmath291 . in general , a higher degree of entanglement is directly related to a pronounced unison motion of angular momenta , _",
    "i.e. _ , with suppressed relative angle fluctuations in agreement with the results of a similar treatment in the framework of standard quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) in addition to the geometrical picture based on relative angles of the angular momenta projections the entanglement of formation can quantitatively be expressed by appropriate bohmian probability distributions and the corresponding shannon entropy .",
    "\\(iv ) the virial theorem for a general system of two rotors is confirmed numerically : the ensemble averaged quantum potential represents one half of the average kinetic energy of the rotors .",
    "a general consequence is a known distinction of bohmian pre - measurement values from after - measurement standard quantum mechanics results .",
    "specifically , spin - spin correlation tensors differ from customary quantum mechanics counterparts by a factor @xmath292 .",
    "\\(v ) for fully entangled qubit pairs the bohmian spin - spin probability distributions exhibit power - law tails and are for particular cases given analytically .",
    "\\(vi ) it is shown that the bohmian analogue of bell s inequalities , expressed in terms of bohmian spin - spin correlators , is for fully entangled states identical to the standard quantum mechanics counterpart , which demonstrates the non - local nature of hidden variables in the present approach .",
    "the source of non - locality lies in the quantum potential which generates an instant coupling between the angular momenta of entangled qubit pairs . in fully entangled states",
    "the angular momenta precess in a particular manner forming a constant relative azimuthal angle @xmath97 which is the origin of a specific form of both , the standard quantum mechanical and the bohmian correlators , @xmath293 leading to the violation of the bell inequalities .",
    "it should be noted that the equality of @xmath285 and @xmath286 guarantees equivalence of bohmian and standard quantum mechanics regarding the ( non)violation of all inequalities which can quantum mechanically be expressed in terms of the elements of spin - spin correlator tensor normalized as in eq .",
