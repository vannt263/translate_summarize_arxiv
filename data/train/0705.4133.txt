    "atomic polarization is the property that describes the condition of population imbalances and quantum coherences between atomic levels @xcite .",
    "population imbalances in a @xmath0-level occur when its zeeman sublevels , characterized by the azimuthal quantum number @xmath2 , are differently populated .",
    "quantum coherences ( or interferences ) occur instead when definite phase relations exist between the wave functions representing two distinct zeeman sublevels .",
    "an atomic @xmath0-level is said to be _ isotropically _ ( or _ naturally _ ) populated if its zeeman sublevels have identical populations , and the quantum coherences among them are completely relaxed .",
    "the study of atomic polarization has played a fundamental role in the quantum mechanical understanding of the photon - atom interaction @xcite , and in devising techniques for controlling and manipulating atoms through radiation ( e.g. , laser cooling @xcite ) . because atomic polarization is affected by the physical conditions of the atomic gas ( e.g. , illumination conditions , external fields , gas density , collisions ) , and it manifests itself in the polarization of the light emitted by the atoms , its study is also fundamental for the diagnostics of plasmas , both in the laboratory and in space @xcite .    in order to represent atomic polarization , it is convenient to adopt the density - matrix formalism . the atomic density matrix projected onto the subspace of a level of total angular momentum @xmath0 is represented by the @xmath3 elements @xmath4 , which satisfy the conjugation property @xmath5 , characterizing hermitian matrices .",
    "the diagonal elements ( @xmath6 ) are proportional to the populations of the @xmath7-states , whereas the off - diagonal elements ( @xmath8 ) represent the quantum coherences between different @xmath7-states .",
    "hence , for an isotropically populated @xmath0-level , the density matrix is simply proportional to the identity matrix of rank @xmath9 .",
    "a @xmath0-level is further said to be _ oriented _ if @xmath10 , and _ aligned _ if sublevels corresponding to different values of @xmath11 have different populations .",
    "in general , an atomic level ( and hence the atomic system ) can be both oriented and aligned .",
    "the concept of orientation and alignment of an atomic level will be further clarified in the next section .",
    "tipically , there are two mechanisms considered in the literature , by which atomic polarization can be created : 1 ) anisotropic and/or polarized excitation by radiation or particles , which selectively populates the different magnetic sublevels in the transition ; 2 ) in the presence of external fields ( electric and/or magnetic ) , a transition is excited by radiation that has spectral structure across the frequency range of level splitting @xcite . in this paper we consider instead a different mechanism , which is the alignment of hydrogen levels in the presence of an electric field , when the atoms are illuminated with a broadband , unpolarized radiation with zero anisotropy ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radiation intensity , and @xmath14 the propagation vector ) .",
    "this phenomenon of _ electric alignment _ has important implications for the diagnostics of electric and magnetic fields in hydrogen plasmas , because it affects the scattering polarization that is produced by anisotropic irradiation and modified by the presence of external fields .",
    "interestingly , there is no magnetic counterpart of this mechanism .",
    "however , if a magnetic field is present simultaneously with the electric field , electric alignment can be converted into atomic orientation via the alignment - to - orientation ( a - o ) conversion mechanism @xcite , resulting in broadband circular polarization ( bcp ) of the scattered radiation .",
    "it is important to remark that electric alignment does not violate any conservation or symmetry principle . in particular",
    ", it can not occur if the atom is illuminated by planckian radiation , or if the electric fields are isotropically distributed ( e.g. , holtsmark - type fields @xcite ) and no magnetic field is present .",
    "we study the mechanism by which an electric field can induce atomic aligment in an ensemble of hydrogen atoms that are initially in an isotropically populated state because of the particular illumination conditions .",
    "this process bears a resemblance with the phenomenon of polarized emission of ly@xmath1 radiation by electric quenching of hydrogen atoms prepared in the 2s@xmath15 metastable state @xcite , since both phenomena are determined by the electric mixing of atomic states of different parity .",
    "however , the case studied in this paper has a much broader impact , because the electric - induced polarized emission of the hydrogen lines ( not restricted to ly@xmath1 ) is attained in a stationary regime of radiative excitation of the hydrogen atoms ( rather than as a transient phenomenon like in the electric quenching of metastable hydrogen atoms ) , under conditions that are very common in hydrogen plasmas , both in the laboratory and in astrophysical objects .",
    "in addition , from our analysis we derive a necessary condition for the generation of electric alignment , which applies to any hydrogen line , and which to our knowledge has not been clarified in previous work .",
    "hydrogen atoms in an isotropically populated state are completely described by the lowest multipole order ( @xmath16 ) of the set of irreducible tensor components of the atomic density matrix ( also known as _ _ statistical tensors _ _ ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the principal quantum number of the level of interest , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath0 , are the orbital , spin , and total angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath21 represents the total population of the level @xmath0 in the atomic term @xmath22 .",
    "a direct evalutation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) also shows that our definition of atomic orientation implies that the @xmath23 multipole of the statistical tensor is not vanishing , whereas atomic alignment implies a non - zero @xmath24 multipole .",
    "sometimes one speaks more generally of orientation ( alignment ) of an atomic system when at least one of the odd ( even ) multipoles of the statistical tensor is not vanishing @xcite .",
    "the statistical equilibrium ( se ) of hydrogen atoms subject to external electric and magnetic fields is governed by the following evolution equation for the atomic density operator , @xmath25 : @xmath26      -\\left(\\gamma\\rho+\\rho\\,\\gamma\\right)+{\\mathscr t}\\rho\\;.\\ ] ] a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) within the formalism of the statistical tensors is given in @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) , @xmath27 is the field - free atomic hamiltonian , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the usual electric and magnetic hamiltonians , and finally @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the two radiation operators that are responsible , respectively , for radiation damping and population transfer .",
    "( in this work , we neglect the role of collisions . ) in the absence of external fields , and in the presence of a broadband , unpolarized radiation with zero anisotropy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) reduces to the well - known rate equations for the atomic populations .",
    "the assumption of broadband illumination of the atoms implies that the pumping radiation has no spectral structure across the frequency range of any given hydrogen line .",
    "it is well known @xcite that under this hypothesis the scattering process can be described as the succession of the two incoherent mechanisms of radiation absorption and re - emission , even in the absence of collisions .",
    "such _ flat - spectrum approximation _ is indeed verified in most astrophysical problems  as well as in many applications to laboratory plasmas , except in the case of laser excitation  and it is a fundamental assumption in the derivation of the results of this work .",
    "schematic model of the hydrogen atom comprising the first three bohr levels .",
    "the transitions indicated with solid lines define the minimal set of radiation processes needed to populate the terms 2s and 2p , in the absence of electric fields . this set forms the basis for the model of hydrogen described by the se system of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : se.1])([eq : se.6 ] ) . ]    by studying the explicit expressions of the magnetic and electric contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) ( see eqs .  [ 17b ] and [ 17c ] in @xcite ) one can see how an external field may be able to transform atomic populations , @xmath32 , into quantum coherences , under the form of non - diagonal orientation components , @xmath33 . in the case of a magnetic field",
    ", these orientation components can only be generated between @xmath0 levels that belong to the same @xmath22 term ( because the magnetic hamiltonian is diagonal with respect to @xmath19 ) .",
    "on the other hand , since by assumption the incident radiation is spectrally flat across the frequency range of any @xmath22@xmath34 transition , the population of these levels always satisfy the condition @xmath35 , characteristic of thermodynamic equilibrium ( te ) . in such case",
    ", one can show that the total magnetic contribution to atomic orientation vanishes .",
    "hence , within the flat - spectrum approximation , a magnetic field can not , by itself , generate atomic polarization in an atomic system that is initially in an isotropically populated state .",
    "this is a well - known fact , which is at the basis of the application of the hanle effect to the magnetic diagnostics of plasmas @xcite .    in the presence of an electric field , instead , the electric hamiltonian mixes levels with @xmath36 , and it is found that population imbalances ( i.e. , out of te ) between such interfering levels can effectively be transformed into atomic polarization .",
    "this process is only inhibited under strict te conditions for the bohr level @xmath18 , when @xmath37 . however , in the absence of collisions , this can only happen if the illumination is planckian ( @xmath38 ; in such case the te distribution of level populations applies to the entire atomic model ) .",
    "otherwise , we must expect a contribution from electric alignment to the polarized radiation scattered by a gas of hydrogen atoms , under a wide range of physical conditions that are commonly found in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . in order to quantify this mechanism",
    ", we consider a simplified model of the hydrogen atom , consisting of the first two bohr levels , plus the 3p term ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect the fine structure of hydrogen ( both spin - orbit interaction and lamb shift ) , and we also assume that the 3p term is isotropically populated .",
    "( this last assumption further reduces the dimensionality of the problem . ) the se of this restricted model of hydrogen  for broadband , unpolarized incident radiation with zero anisotropy , and in the presence of an electric field ( which defines the quantization axis)is governed by 6 rate equations derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) .",
    "these equations involve the populations of the four levels considered in the model , the alignment of the 2p level ( @xmath39 ) , and the imaginary part of the atomic orientation coherence , @xmath40 , between the levels 2s and 2p ( @xmath41 ) . after imposing the stationary condition @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) yields the following linear system @xmath43 where we indicated with @xmath44 the radiative rate for the transition from bohr s level @xmath18 to @xmath45 , and with @xmath46 the angular frequency associated with the electric field strength . to completely determine the solution of this linear system",
    ", we must impose the conservation of the total atomic population , @xmath47 . solving the linear system algebraically ,",
    "we find @xmath48 these relations show that the alignment of the 2p term is a direct consequence of the quantum coherence between the 2s and 2p terms due to electric mixing of the same terms , as expected .",
    "however , under te conditions , electric alignment can not be generated , because @xmath49 . in the limit of very strong fields , the quantum coherence between the 2s and 2p terms vanishes , whereas the atomic alignment of the 2p term reaches the asymptotic value of @xmath50 which again is zero under te conditions .",
    "alignment of the 2p term of hydrogen as a function of the electric field strength ( solid line ) .",
    "the atomic model includes all bohr s levels up to @xmath51 with fine structure .",
    "the dashed line shows the same quantity for the restricted model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : se.1])([eq : se.6 ] ) . ]    for comparison , we calculated numerically the alignment of the 2p term for a model of hydrogen that includes all bohr s levels up to @xmath51 with fine structure ( the dimension of the se system is 1416@xmath521416 in such case ) .",
    "this quantity depends on the alignment of the fine - structured levels , according to the formula    @xmath53    which gives in our case @xmath54\\ ] ] ( for simplicity of notation , we suppressed the configuration superscript ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : align ] , we show the alignment of the 2p term normalized by the quantity @xmath55 , as a function of the electric field strength .",
    "the illumination conditions are such that @xmath56 with zero anisotropy .",
    "the solid line shows the alignment calculated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : align.2p ] ) , whereas the dashed line shows the alignment computed according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : align_toy ] ) and ( [ eq : orien_toy ] ) .",
    "we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : align_infinity ] ) gives the correct strong - field limit also in the case of a realistic model of hydrogen .",
    "the disagreement between the two cases for intermediate field strengths is mainly due to the omission of the fine structure in the model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : se.1])([eq : se.6 ] ) .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : align_toy ] ) and ( [ eq : orien_toy ] ) , we can also conclude that both the alignment of the 2p term and the coherence between the 2s and 2p terms vanish identically when we restrict the atomic model below the minimal set of levels highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "in fact , one can show that the quantity @xmath55 contains a factor @xmath57 , which is zero if we eliminate the 3p term .",
    "it follows that electric alignment can not be produced in a two - term model of hydrogen , for example , when the atoms are illuminated only by ly@xmath1 radiation.)([eq : se.6 ] ) with just ly@xmath58 radiation , to be able to induce electric alignment in the 2p term . in that case",
    ", we reproduce the results for the electric quenching of metastable hydrogen atoms previously considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "specifically , for very large field strengths the ly@xmath1 radiation is found to be completely polarized along the applied electric field ( @xmath59 ) , whereas for vanishing field strengths ( taking into account the fine structure of hydrogen ) we find @xmath60 , in agreement with the results of @xcite for the case of `` diabatic '' quenching considered in that work . ]",

    "the plot shows the case of random - azimuth electric fields of different inclinations ( dashed curves ) , and the case of isotropic electric fields ( thick solid curve ) . ]",
    "we now consider some examples of broadband polarization of the scattered radiation of hydrogen lines , resulting from electric alignment .",
    "all results in this section are calculated assuming the same illumination conditions and hydrogen model ( complete up to @xmath51 with fine structure ) adopted for fig .",
    "[ fig : align ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : e+b=1000.lin ] shows the broadband linear polarization ( blp ) of the ly@xmath1 scattered radiation , due to the alignment generated by various distribution of electric fields , and in the presence of a magnetic field with @xmath62 directed along the quantization axis .",
    "the reference direction for positive polarization is perpendicular to the quantization axis . as a model for the anisotropic distributions of electric fields , we considered the case of random - azimuth fields with various inclinations from the quantization axis ( @xmath63 ) . for such distributions the hydrogen levels are aligned , resulting in blp of the scattered radiation ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the alignment is zero for vanishing electric fields , as expected , because the coherences @xmath64 are zero in that case . on the contrary",

    "( [ eq : align_infinity ] ) . in the case of isotropic electric fields ( thick solid curve ) , the blp generally does not vanish , because different field directions in the isotropic distribution are not equivalent when the spherical symmetry is already broken by the presence of the magnetic field . however , it vanishes for very strong electric fields , as expected for symmetry reasons .     same as fig .",
    "[ fig : e+b=1000.lin ] , but for the degree of bcp observed along the magnetic field . ]    figure [ fig : e+b=1000.cir ] shows the bcp of ly@xmath1 , for the same distributions of the electric and magnetic fields of fig .",
    "[ fig : e+b=1000.lin ] .",
    "we see that the presence of the magnetic field is capable of converting the electric alignment of the hydrogen levels into atomic orientation via the a - o mechanism @xcite .",

    "in this paper we demonstrated that it is possible to generate atomic alignment of hydrogen levels _ radiatively _ through a mechanism that does not require anisotropic illumination , polarization , or spectrally modulated radiation .",
    "the alignment is instead generated by an electric field that mixes atomic levels having imbalanced populations ( out of te ) .    in practice",
