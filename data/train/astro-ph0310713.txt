    "since the discovery of cosmic rays @xcite , the sites and mechanisms of cosmic ray acceleration up to the knee energy , which is a spectral kink of cosmic rays at @xmath3  ev , have been key problems . the most plausible scenario is diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) in the shock fronts of supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite ; in this scenario , particles receive energy whenever they cross the shock from downstream to upstream .",
    "@xcite discovered synchrotron x - rays from the shock front of sn  1006 , and confirmed that the snr accelerates cosmic rays up to @xmath0tev , together with the discovery of inverse compton tev @xmath4-rays @xcite , which helps us to estimate the magnetic field and the maximum energy of electrons .",
    "non - thermal x - rays are the best tracer of cosmic ray acceleration sites .",
    "in fact , several galactic snrs have already been confirmed as cosmic ray accelerators using hard x - rays ( sn  1006 ; koyama et al .",

    "the _ asca _ galactic plane survey has also found some candidates @xcite .",
    "although several galactic snrs have been confirmed to be sites of cosmic ray acceleration , some problems remain . for example",
    ", no snr has been found in which cosmic rays are accelerated up to the knee energy .",
    "in fact , @xcite have suggested that the maximum energy of cosmic rays accelerated in snrs is at most @xmath6  ev , an order of magnitude below the knee energy .",
    "super bubbles ( sbs ) are large hot cavities created by the combined actions of fast stellar winds and successive supernova ( sn ) explosions of massive stars in ob star associations . thus , sbs are strong candidates for being sites where cosmic rays are accelerated to higher energies ( c.f . ,",
    "bykov & fleishman  1992 , klepach , ptuskin , & zirakashvili  2000 ) . however , it is difficult to study sbs in detail .",
    "their distances , and thus their sizes and energies , remain uncertain in our galaxy . furthermore , interstellar absorption often prevents observations at optical , uv , and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) provides an ideal location to examine the acceleration of cosmic rays in sbs because of its proximity ( 50  kpc ; feast 1999 ) , low inclination angle ( 3040 ; westerlund 1997 ) , and low foreground absorption ( @xmath7  mag ; bessel 1991 ) .",
    "the lmc provides a sample of numerous sbs at a common distance that is resolvable by modern x - ray detectors . for this study , we singled out 30  dor  c as being the best target for our search .",
    "a radio source was discovered by @xcite south - west of 30  dor , and was named 30  dor  c , which is now categorized as a sb .",

    ", complex h@xmath2 , h@xmath8 , and [ sii ] emissions were found , which are bright in the south - east , but dim in the other side @xcite . in the x - ray band , _ einstein _ detected the eastern shell of the 30  dor region for the first time @xcite .",

    "the data reductions and analyses were made using the _ xmm - newton _ standard analysis system ( sas ; watson et al 2001 ) version 5.4.1 ; we performed the basic pipeline process following the sas guide .",

    "a clear shell - like structure with a radius of @xmath0  170   ( @xmath13  pc - radius at the 50  kpc distance ) is seen in both bands . in detail , however , the morphologies are different from each other ; the entire shell is seen in the soft band , whereas the hard x - rays are visible only at the western part .",
    "catalogued snrs , the honeycomb nebula ( snr  0536@xmath569.3 ) and sn  1987a are also seen mainly in the soft band ( see figure  [ images ] ) .",
    "the x - ray features of these objects have been reported with _",
    "xmm - newton _ @xcite and _ chandra _ @xcite monitoring observations .",
    "in addition to the diffuse structure , some point - like sources are found inside 30  dor  c. the exposure time of the _ xmm - newton _ observations are short , most of the data suffer from a high background , and the spatial resolution is not sufficient .",
    "hence , we concentrated on the _ chandra _ data for the point - source search and analysis . at first",
    ", point sources were searched for with the _ wavdetect _ softwarein the 0.58.0  kev band images , then manually inspected for any spurious point - like structure due mainly to a part of the diffuse emission .",
    "we thus found six point sources with a significance level of @xmath117.0@xmath14 , as shown in figure  [ images ] and table  [ point ] .",
    "for these six point sources , we searched for optical , infrared , and radio counterparts , and found that three ( no.1 , 3 , and 4 ) coincide at the positions of the brightest star clusters : @xmath2 , @xmath8 , and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we therefore checked further for any x - ray emission from the other clusters ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) , which are also members of the ob association lh  90 @xcite encompassed by the 30  dor  c shell .",
    "however , we found no excess x - rays from these clusters at the 3@xmath14 limit .",
    "we also searched for x - ray counterparts from _ rosat _ pspc and hri catalogues @xcite , but found no candidate .      in the _ chandra _ observations , we can see that the diffuse structure consists of several shell fragments ( see figure  [ images ] ) , and the whole structure is widely spread over the two observed regions with different configurations of the ccd types ( back - illuminated and front - illuminated ) .",
    "therefore , a spectral analysis on all of the diffuse structure is technically and scientifically complicated .",
    "for this reason , we divided the diffuse structure into four regions ( hereafter shells a ",
    "d ) , as shown in figure  [ images ] , and performed the spectral analysis separately for each shell .",
    "we excluded all of the detected point sources ( see  [ sec_results_image ] ) from each shell .",
    "the background regions were also selected separately for each shell from the source - free regions in the same ccd and observations as those of the shells .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ fields covered the whole diffuse structure .",
    "however , for consistency with the _ chandra _ analysis , we divided the diffuse structure into shells  a  d , the same as in the _ chandra _ case .",
    "the background regions were selected from the source - free regions in the same observation .",
    "the spectra of each shell taken from all the available observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ were analyzed simultaneously .",
    "however , for brevity , we show only the _ chandra _ spectra ( background - subtracted ) and the fitting results in figure  [ shell_spec ] .    for spectral analyses",
    ", we used xspec v11.00 @xcite the spectrum of shell  a shows many line - like structures with the center energies at 0.58 , 0.68 , 0.92 , and 1.35  kev , which correspond to the emission lines of he - like o k@xmath2 and k@xmath8 , he - like ne , and he - like mg , respectively .",
    "we therefore fit the spectrum with a thin - thermal plasma model in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) ( nei ; borkowski et al .",
    "2001a ) with the mean lmc abundances @xcite .",
    "the interstellar absorption in our galaxy and lmc were treated separately .",
    "the galactic absorption column was estimated using the hi data by @xcite as @xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite reported that the value of @xmath20 , measured in the x - ray band , is twice that of @xmath21 in the case of @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we fixed the galactic absorption column to be @xmath24  @xmath19 ; we used the cross sections by @xcite and the solar abundances @xcite .",
    "the absorption column in the lmc was , on the other hand , treated as a free parameter with the mean lmc abundance @xcite .",
    "this thin - thermal plasma model was rejected with a @xmath25/degree of freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    "=  331.8/211 , even if we allow the abundances to be free , leaving a systematic data residual at the high - energy band .",
    "we hence added a power - law component on the thin - thermal model . since the two - component model still leaves large residuals at about 0.8  kev and 1.3  kev , we allowed the abundance of fe and mg in the thermal plasma ( `` nei '' component ) to be free .",
    "the fitting was then greatly improved with a @xmath25/d.o.f = 264.6/209 .",
    "although this two - component model is still rejected in a statistical point of view , further fine tuning on the model is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "figure  [ shell_spec ] and table  [ spec_a ] show the best - fit models and parameters , respectively .    unlike shell  a , the x - ray spectra of shells  b  d are hard and featureless , suggesting non - thermal origin .",
    "in fact , a thin thermal model fitting requires an unrealistically high temperature ( @xmath11  2  kev ) and low abundances ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we therefore fitted the spectra with a power - law model with absorption , which was calculated in the same way as that for shell  a , and found acceptable fits for all of the spectra . the best - fit models and parameters",
    "are shown in figure  [ shell_spec ] and table  [ spec_nt ] , respectively .",
    "it is conceivable that the spectra of shells b ",
    "d may include a small fraction of the thin - thermal component found in shell a. we therefore added the same thin - thermal spectrum as that for shell  a , and fitted with this composite model ( thin - thermal plus power - law ) .",
    "the free parameters are normalizations of the two components : power - law index and @xmath20 value .",
    "however , no significant fraction of the thin thermal component is found from shells  b  d .",
    "for all of the point sources , the x - ray photons are collected from an ellipse with the radii of the point spread function ( psf ) , as listed in table  [ point ] .",
    "we note that all of the sources are located far from the on - axis position of the x - ray mirror , and hence the psfs are larger than the best value of _ chandra _ psf ( @xmath0 0.5on the aim point ) .",
    "the background regions were selected from source - free regions in the same way as the diffuse emissions .",
    "we first fitted the spectra with a thin - thermal plasma model in collisional equilibrium ( mekal ; mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord  1985 ; kaastra 1992 ) with an absorption calculated in the same way as diffuse emission .",
    "the abundances are fixed to be 0.3 solar , the average value of interstellar medium in the lmc .",
    "the fittings are acceptable for two sources ( no .  1 and 4 ) with reasonable temperature ( 2.1 and 1.0  kev ) , but for the spectra of the other 4 sources , the models are either rejected or require an unreasonably high temperature .",
    "we therefore fitted the spectra of these sources with a power - law model .",
    "the best - fit parameters and the reduced @xmath25s are listed in table  [ point ] .",
    "the absorption columns of the north - eastern shells ( shells a and b ) are similar to those of most sources in the lmc ( @xmath27  @xmath19 ) , whereas those of the other shells ( c and d ) are significantly larger ( @xmath28  @xmath19 ) than the typical lmc absorption .",
    "a similar trend was found for the point sources ; those in the western half , no.1 and 2 , have a larger @xmath20 ( @xmath28  @xmath19 ) than those in the eastern sources , no.36 ( @xmath29  @xmath19 ) . since @xcite has already reported this tendency , we have thus confirmed the results with the better spatial and spectral capability of _",
    "chandra_. this systematic increase of absorption toward the western region of 30  dor  c may be due to extra absorption of a molecular cloud located in front of the western half of 30  dor  c. to verify our conjecture , we searched for the molecular cloud in the co map ( figure  2(a ) in yamaguchi et al .",

    "the age of this star association , or that of 30  dor  c , is on the order of a few to 10  myr @xcite .",
    "the thermal emissions are enhanced in the south - eastern side of 30  dor  c ( around shell  a ) .",
    "the position of this component coincides with that of the h@xmath2 emission @xcite .",
    "the plasma temperature of 30  dor  c is rather high compared to those of other lmc sbs @xcite , although it becomes significantly lower than previous results @xcite .",
    "perhaps due to the poor spectral resolution of _ rosat _ , previous observations could not resolve the power - law component ( hard spectrum ) from the thermal emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of 30  dor  c is significantly lower than that of the other sbs @xcite . with the assumption that the plasma in shell  a distributes uniformly in the ellipsoid with radii of @xmath34 ( total volume @xmath35  @xmath36 ) , the mean density ( @xmath37 ) , thermal energy ( @xmath38 ) and the age of the plasma ( @xmath39 ) were calculated as follows using the emission measure @xmath40 and ionization time scale",

    "the overabundance of a light element ( mg ) relative to heavier element ( fe ) may indicate that a type ii sn occurred @xcite .",
    "thus , the progenitor is a massive star which is a member of cluster lh  90 @xcite near the center of 30  dor  c ( see section   [ sec : point ] ) .      in the 843  mhz band",
    ", @xcite found a clear radio shell , which is brightest on the south - western side ( around shells  c and d ) and dim on the eastern side .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emissions are enhanced at the radio bright shell .",
    "this fact implies that the non - thermal x - rays are emitted by the same mechanism as the radio band .",
    "therefore , the non - thermal x - rays are likely to be synchrotron radiation from the accelerated electrons , like sn  1006 @xcite and other snrs , which accelerate particles up to tev .",
    "the x - ray photon index of 2.12.9 ( see table  [ spec_nt ] ) is , in fact , typical to synchrotron emissions .    to verify the synchrotron origin , we fitted the x - ray spectra with a srcut model , which represents the synchrotron emission from electrons with an energy distribution of a power - law plus exponential cut - off @xcite .",
    "since the radio index data is not accurate due to the large background and contamination of thermal emission @xcite , we fixed the spectral index ( @xmath2 ) at 1  ghz to be 0.5 , which is expected from the first - order fermi acceleration and similar to that of sn  1006 ( @xmath42 ; allen , petre , gotthelf 2001 ) .",
    "the fittings were statistically acceptable , and the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ spec_nt ] .",
    "the best - fit cut - off frequency is also similar to that of sn  1006 , although the age of 30  dor  c may be on the same order as that of lh  90 ( 10  myr ; lucke & hodge 1970 ) , which is far larger than sn  1006 .",
    "this implies that , depending on the environment , the acceleration of high - energy electrons up to the knee energy can continue for a far longer time than the previous consensus for the snr case ( @xmath43  yrs ; reynolds and keohane 1999 ) .",
    "the electron acceleration time may have been extended , because successive supernova explosions in 30 dor c , possibly over the course of a few myr , may more - or - less continuously produce high - energy electrons .",
    "the total luminosity of the non - thermal component ( @xmath44  ergs  s@xmath12 ) is about 10-times larger than that of sn  1006 @xcite .",
    "this large non - thermal flux in 30  dor  c would be due to the large energy supply by multiple successive supernova explosions .",
    "the expected flux density at 1  ghz is 3.0 ( 2.44.6)@xmath45  jy with @xmath46 , which is significantly smaller than the observed value ( 1.0  jy ; mills et al .  1984 ) .",
    "this `` inconsistency '' is not relaxed , even if we assume a larger radio index of @xmath47 ( 1.8 ( 1.42.5)@xmath48jy , as shown in table  [ spec_nt ] ) .",
    "we infer that the larger observed radio flux than that expected from x - rays would be due to either the contamination of thermal radio flux or a large uncertainty of the background level ( see mills et al .  1984 ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission @xcite is anti - correlated with the non - thermal components .",
    "similar features have been observed in some of other snrs with synchrotron x - rays : sn  1006 @xcite and rcw  86 @xcite .",
    "because the h@xmath2 region has higher density , it may have a higher magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the maximum electron energy is limited by the quick synchrotron energy loss , leading to reduced non - thermal x - rays .",
    "we have identified three point - like x - ray sources ( no .  1 , 3 , and 4 ) to the tight clusters of massive stars @xmath2 , @xmath8 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "<S> we report on the discovery of thermal and non - thermal x - rays from the shells of the super bubble ( sb ) 30  dor  c in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray morphology is a nearly circular shell with a radius of @xmath040  pc , which is bright on the northern and western sides . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the shells are different from region to region . </S>",
    "<S> the southern shell shows clear emission lines , and is well fitted with a model of a thin - thermal plasma ( @xmath1  kev ) in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plus a power - law component . </S>",
    "<S> this thermal plasma is located inside of the h@xmath2 emission , which is the outer edge of the shell of the sb . </S>",
    "<S> the northern and western sides of the sb are dim in h@xmath2 emission , but are bright in non - thermal ( power - law ) x - rays with a photon index of 2.12.9 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - thermal x - ray shell traces the outer boundary of the radio shell . </S>",
    "<S> these features of thin - thermal and non - thermal x - rays are similar to those of sn  1006 , a prototype of synchrotron x - ray shell , but the non - thermal component of 30  dor  c is about ten - times brighter than that of sn  1006 . 30  dor  c is the first candidate of an extragalactic sb , in which energetic electrons are accelerating in the shell . </S>",
    "<S> the age is much older than that of sn  1006 , and hence the particle acceleration time in this sb may be longer than those in normal shell - like snrs . </S>",
    "<S> we found point - like sources associated with some of tight star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray luminosity and spectrum are consistent with those of young clusters of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> point - like sources with non - thermal spectra are also found in the sb . </S>",
    "<S> these may be background objects ( agns ) or stellar remnants ( neutron stars or black holes ) . </S>"
