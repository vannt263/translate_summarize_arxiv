    "the effective field theory ( eft ) approach provides a powerful framework that exploits the separation of scales in physical systems .",
    "only low - energy ( or long - range ) degrees of freedom are included explicitly , with the rest parametrized in terms of the most general local ( contact ) interactions .",
    "this procedure exploits the fact that a low - energy probe of momentum @xmath0 can not resolve structures on scales smaller than @xmath1 . in this talk . ] using renormalization , the influence of short - distance physics on low - energy observables is captured in a small number of low - energy constants .",
    "thus , the eft describes universal low - energy physics independent of detailed assumptions about the short - distance dynamics .",
    "all physical observables can be described in a controlled expansion in powers of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the characteristic low - energy length scale of the system .",
    "the size of @xmath3 depends on the system under consideration : for a finite - range potential , e.g. , it is given by the range of the potential .",
    "for the systems discussed here , @xmath3 is of the order of the effective range @xmath4 or the van der waals scale @xmath5 .",
    "effective field theories can be obtained by applying a renormalization group ( rg ) transformation to a ( more ) fundamental theory .",
    "the rg transformation integrates out high momentum modes from the fundamental theory and leads to a description of low - energy physics in terms of low - energy degrees of freedom only .",
    "it can be understood as a change of the resolution scale of the eft .",
    "the transformation generates a flow in the space of coupling constants that determine the effective lagrangian @xmath6 .",
    "if the rg transformation is continuous , this flow can be expressed by a differential equation for the coupling constants @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ultraviolet cutoff which corresponds to the inverse resolution scale .",
    "the function @xmath10 determines the behavior of @xmath7 under the rg transformation .",
    "the rg equation ( [ eq : rgeq ] ) can have many types of solutions .",
    "the two simplest ones are ( a ) renormalization group fixed points and ( b ) renormalization group limit cycles .",
    "fixed points are ubiquitous in condensed matter and particle physics .",
    "they play an important role , e.g. , in critical phenomena and the scale dependence of coupling constants in high energy physics .",
    "renormalization group limit cycles have been suggested by ken wilson already in 1971 @xcite , but their phenomenological importance has only been realized very recently .    an important signature of a limit cycle is the appearance of a discrete scaling symmetry , the invariance of physical observables under changes of the resolution scale by a discrete scale transformation with a preferred scaling factor @xmath11 .",
    "the prime example of a rg limit cycle is the efimov effect @xcite for 3-body systems with large s - wave scattering length @xmath12 .",
    "vitaly efimov discovered that in the limit @xmath13 there can be infinitely many 3-body bound states ( trimers ) with an accumulation point at the scattering threshold @xcite .",
    "these trimers are called efimov states .",
    "one remarkable feature of efimov states is that they have a geometric spectrum with preferred scaling factor @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the binding wavenumber of the branch of efimov states labeled by @xmath17 .",
    "the efimov effect is just one example of the universal phenomena characterized by the discrete scaling symmetry in the 3-body system @xcite .",
    "these universal properties persist also for finite values of the scattering length as long as @xmath18 . for a review of these phenomena , which we refer to as efimov physics ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a generic system ,",
    "the scattering length is of the same order of magnitude as the low - energy length scale @xmath3 .",
    "only a very specific choice of the parameters in the underlying theory ( a so - called fine tuning ) will generate a large scattering length .",
    "nevertheless , systems with large scattering length can be found in many areas of physics .",
    "examples are the s - wave scattering of nucleons and of @xmath19he atoms . for alkali atoms close to a feshbach resonance , @xmath12 can be tuned experimentally by adjusting an external magnetic field .",
    "this is particularly interesting , since it allows to experimentally test the dependence of physical observables on the scattering length .    in this talk , we discuss some applications of an eft for few - body systems with large scattering length @xmath18 @xcite . in this theory , the limit cycle is manifest in the rg behavior of the 3-body interaction which makes it ideally suited to study the efimov effect and its consequences for other 3-body observables .",
    "we first give a very brief review of the eft for few - body systems with large scattering length @xmath12 , focusing on s - waves .",
    "a more detailed treatment is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for typical momenta @xmath20 ,",
    "the eft expansion is in powers of @xmath21 so that higher order corrections are suppressed by powers of @xmath21 .",
    "we consider a 2-body system of nonrelativistic bosons ( referred to as atoms ) with large scattering length @xmath12 and mass @xmath22 . at sufficiently low energies",
    ", the most general lagrangian may be written as : @xmath23 where the @xmath24 and @xmath25 are nonderivative 2- and 3-body interaction terms , respectively .",
    "the strength of the @xmath24 term is determined by the scattering length @xmath12 , while @xmath25 depends on a 3-body parameter to be introduced below .",
    "the dots represent higher - order terms which are suppressed at low - energies . for momenta @xmath0 of the order of the inverse scattering length @xmath26 , the problem is nonperturbative in @xmath27 .",
    "the exact 2-body scattering amplitude can be obtained analytically by summing the so - called bubble diagrams with the @xmath24 interaction term .",
    "the @xmath25 term does not contribute to 2-body observables .",
    "after renormalization , the resulting amplitude reproduces the leading order of the well - known effective range expansion for the atom - atom scattering amplitude :  @xmath28 where the total energy is @xmath29 . if @xmath30 , @xmath31 has a pole at @xmath32 corresponding to a shallow dimer with the universal binding energy @xmath33 .",
    "higher - order interactions are perturbative and give the momentum - dependent terms in the effective range expansion .",
    "we now turn to the 3-body system . at leading order",
    ", the atom - dimer scattering amplitude is given by the integral equation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ineq ] .",
    "a solid line indicates a single atom and a double line indicates an interacting two - atom state ( including rescattering corrections ) .",
    "the integral equation contains contributions from both the 2-body and the 3-body interaction terms .",
    "the inhomogeneous term is given by the first two diagrams on the right - hand side : the one - atom exchange diagram and the 3-body term .",
    "the integral equation simply sums these diagrams to all orders . after projecting onto s - waves , we obtain the equation @xmath34 for the off - shell atom - dimer scattering amplitude with the inhomogeneous term @xmath35 the first term is the s - wave projected one - atom exchange , while the second term comes from the 3-body interaction .",
    "the physical atom - dimer scattering amplitude @xmath36 is given by the solution @xmath37 evaluated at the on - shell point :  @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "the 3-body binding energies @xmath40 are given by those values of @xmath41 for which the homogeneous version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhvk ] ) has a nontrivial solution .",
    "note that an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath9 has been introduced in ( [ eq : bhvk ] ) .",
    "this cutoff is required to insure that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhvk ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "all physical observables , however , must be invariant under changes of the cutoff , which determines the behavior of @xmath42 as a function of @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath43 \\over \\cos [ s_0 \\ln ( \\lambda/ \\lambda _ * ) - \\arctan s_0]}\\ , , \\label{h - lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a transcendental number and @xmath45 is a 3-body parameter introduced by dimensional transmutation .",
    "this parameter can not be predicted by the eft and must be taken from experiment .",
    "it is evident that @xmath46 is periodic and runs on a limit cycle .",
    "when @xmath9 is changed by the preferred scaling factor @xmath47 , @xmath42 returns to its original value .",
    "note that the definition of the 3-body parameter is not unique .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ h - lambda ] ) arises naturally in the eft description , while the parameter @xmath16 from eq .",
    "( [ kappa - star ] ) is defined via the 3-body efimov spectrum in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "both definitions are related by a constant factor : @xmath49 @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "two parameters are required in the 3-body system at leading order in @xmath21 : the scattering length @xmath12 ( or the dimer binding energy @xmath50 ) and the 3-body parameter @xmath45 or @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the eft reproduces the universal aspects of the 3-body system first derived by efimov @xcite and is a very efficient calculational tool to calculate those properties .",
    "we now turn to some applications of this eft to systems of cold atoms .",
    "first we discuss universal scaling functions .",
    "since only two parameters enter at leading oder , different 3-body observables show correlations .",
    "these correlations must appear in all 3-body systems with short - range interactions and large scattering length . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , we display the scaling function relating the trimer excited and ground state energies @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the data points give various calculations using realistic @xmath19he potentials while the solid line gives the universal prediction from eft .",
    "different points on this line correspond to different values of @xmath16 .",
    "the small deviations of the potential calculations from the universal curve are mainly due to effective range corrections and can be calculated at next - to - leading order in eft @xcite .",
    "the calculation corresponding to the data point far off the universal curve can easily be identified as problematic . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , we display a similar correlation between the triton binding @xmath53 and the spin - doublet @xmath54-wave neutron - deuteron scattering length @xmath55 from nuclear physics taken from @xcite , which is known as the phillips line .     versus @xmath56 for @xmath19he atoms @xcite .",

    "it is evident that nuclear and atomic systems show the same universal scaling behavior .",
    "while these systems have very different structure at short distances , all that matters here is that @xmath57 but not the details of the mechanism leading to the large scattering length .",
    "there are also observable features directly related to the occurence of a limit cycle in the 3-body system .",
    "the discrete scale invariance is manifest in the log - periodic dependence of 3-body observables on the scattering length @xmath12 .",
    "this dependence can be tested in experiments with cold atoms close to a feshbach resonance . for this purpose",
    "we consider 3-body recombination , which is the process when three atoms scatter to form a dimer and the third atom balances energy and momentum .",
    "this is one of the main loss processes for trapped atoms and condensates of atoms near a feshbach resonance .",
    "the event rate @xmath58 per unit time and unit volume can be parametrized as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the density of the atoms and @xmath61 is the recombination constant .",
    "unfortunately , heavy alkali atoms , such as rb and cs , form many deeply - bound diatomic molecules .",
    "therefore , efimov states are resonances rather than sharp states , because they can decay into a deep molecule and an energetic atom .",
    "the presence of deep molecules also affects other 3-body observables , but using unitarity their influence can be accounted for by one real parameter @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this parameter describes how much probability is lost by scattering into the deep bound states . for @xmath63 the observables are not modified , while for @xmath64 all probability is lost into the deep states .",
    "the consequences of the limit cycle become totally washed out for @xmath65 .",
    "the 3-body recombination coefficient @xmath61 was first calculated in refs .",
    "analytical expressions for @xmath61 as a function of @xmath12 , @xmath16 , and @xmath62 have been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a recent experiment with cold @xmath66cs atoms ,",
    "the innsbruck group has presented the first experimental evidence for efimov physics @xcite .",
    "they used a feshbach resonance to control the scattering length of @xmath66cs atoms .",
    "since inelastic 2-body losses were energetically forbidden , the dominant loss mechanisms were inelastic 3-body losses . by varying the external magnetic field , they were able to change the scattering length from @xmath67 through 0 to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the bohr radius .",
    "they observed a giant loss feature at a magnetic field that corresponds to the scattering length @xmath70 .",
    "they also measured the 3-body recombination rate for positive values of @xmath12 reached by increasing the magnetic field through a zero of the scattering length .",
    "they observed a local minimum in the inelastic loss rate at a magnetic field that corresponds to a scattering length of 210(10 ) @xmath69 .",
    "their data could well described by the universal expressions from refs .",

    "both parameters are well determined by the resonance : @xmath16 by the position of the efimov resonance and @xmath62 by the height of the peak .     in @xmath66cs for @xmath76 .",
