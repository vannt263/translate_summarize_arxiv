    "quantum nonlocality , the fact that entangled quantum systems separated in space can violate bell inequalities @xcite , is one of the most profound discoveries in science .",
    "this nonlocal nature of entanglement has also been identified as an essential resource for various quantum information processing tasks .",
    "it allows to reduce communication complexity @xcite or makes it possible to devise device - independent protocols for quantum key distribution @xcite , genuine random number generations @xcite , and state tomography @xcite .",
    "indeed , these tasks can be performed without resorting to the actual inner working of the devices , which is a feat without counterpart in the classical world .    in all of the above instances ,",
    "quantum nonlocality arises when space - like separated measurements are performed over jointly prepared entangled states .",
    "however , the existence of nonlocality can also be manifested in a dual setup @xcite,@xcite : quantum states which are prepared separately ( hence unentangled ) exhibit anomalous correlations when measured jointly . in this case , more information can be revealed by joint measurements than can be gained by using any sequence of local operations assisted by classical communication ( locc ) . in particular , the superiority of globally entangled measurements over locc ones has been proved conclusively @xcite .",
    "the improved performance is due to entanglement occurring in the process of measurement and again it is not associated with the states .    for quantifying the effectiveness of entangled measurements , different figures of merit have been proposed , like the shannon mutual information @xcite or the quantum fidelity @xcite .",
    "a common feature of those is , though , that one must rely both on the precise _ form of the states _ prepared and on the _ a priori probabilities _ of the preparations ; otherwise , the estimations on the figure of merit would be not reliable .",
    "hence , in order to ascertain that a measurement is truly globally entangled and not only an locc one , one must resort to a detailed knowledge of the preparation procedure .",
    "clearly , this issue sheds doubt on the reliability of the obtained results .    in the present paper",
    "we take another approach , more in the spirit of a black box scenario , and tackle the problem of certifying entangled measurements by introducing a kind of dual bell inequalities .",
    "these inequalities involve correlation terms which can be gathered from experimental data , and do not depend on the specific form of the quantum states to be prepared . actually , the only necessary condition entering in the derivation is the hilbert space dimension of the prepared particles .",
    "taking into account that entangled measurements enable increased classical capacity of quantum channels @xcite and efficient quantum state estimation @xcite , in the future it would also be interesting to find applications related to these tasks within a black box approach .",
    "the notation we use along the article is introduced in the next section .",
    "section  [ nonlin ] provides an instance of certifiable entangled measurements based on a nonlinear inequality .",
    "section  [ lin ] is devoted to a numerical study where linear inequalities are applied to detect entangled measurements in the simplest possible scenarios .",
    "section  [ conc ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "let us imagine the following communication scenario , close to the spirit of the simultaneous message passing model @xcite .",
    "two separated parties , alice and bob , have each some preparation device with @xmath0 possible inputs .",
    "alice ( bob ) is thus able to prepare any of the unknown qudit states @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "alice and bob then send their states to a third party , charlie , who performs a measurement over those two states , announcing a dit @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 at the end of the process .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the elements of charlie s positive operator valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "then , for each pair of inputs @xmath6 and @xmath7 , several repetitions of this primitive would allow alice and bob to estimate the frequency of occurrence    p(a|x , y)(_x_ym_a )    of each outcome @xmath8 . depending on the form of the povm elements",
    "@xmath5 , we will distinguish four different types of measurements :    _ classical measurements . _",
    "suppose that charlie s measurement is fixed in advance to a given complete projective measurement on each system ( say , in the computational basis ) , followed by some random processing of the raw output .",
    "any set of distributions @xmath9 so generated can be reproduced in a classical setting where alice and bob send each one dit of information to charlie , who , in turn , applies a random function @xmath10 and then announces the result . for each @xmath11 scenario",
    ", we will denote by @xmath12 the set of all possible correlations @xmath9 that can be attained in such a way .",
    "it is easy to see that any point of @xmath12 is a convex combination of deterministic classical strategies .",
    "as we will see , though , the converse is not true . on the other hand , if alice , bob and charlie share random variables , then any convex sum of deterministic strategies can be attained . since for any @xmath11 scenario the number of deterministic classical strategies is finite , the set of correlations attainable through classical maps and shared randomness is a polytope , that we will denote by @xmath13 .",
    "this classical set is symbolized in figure  [ sets ] by a square .     scenario .",
    "the square represents the classical set @xmath13 , the circle and the ellipse designate the set of unentangled ( @xmath14 ) and the set of entangled measurements ( @xmath15 ) , respectively . in the purple region",
    "entangled measurements are witnessed by linear inequalities.,width=7 ]    _ unentangled and locc measurements . _",
    "if each of the povm elements @xmath16 is a separable operator , we will say that the measurement @xmath17 is unentangled .",
    "we will say that charlie s measurement can be attained via local operations and classical communications ( locc ) if @xmath17 corresponds to a sequence of local measurements on alice s and bob s individual qubits , with each measurement possibly depending on the outcomes of earlier measurements .",
    "it is known that the class of unentangled measurements is strictly greater than the class of locc measurements @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 resp .",
    "denote the sets of distributions @xmath9 attainable through unentangled and locc measurements in a given @xmath11 scenario .",
    "it is an open question whether such an inclusion is strict .    as before ,",
    "if we allow alice , bob and charlie share some prior random variables , the resulting sets of correlations @xmath20 are convexifications of the former . a two - dimensional slice of the unentangled set @xmath14 is symbolized in figure  [ sets ] by a circle .    _",
    "general measurements .",
    "_ here the measurement operators are only limited by positivity and normalization constraints , i.e. , m_a0,_a=0^k-1m_a= ,    where the operators @xmath21 may very well be entangled .",
    "these are the most general measurements allowed by quantum mechanics . in analogy with the former sets",
    ", we will denote by @xmath22 and @xmath15 the set of distributions accessible through general joint measurements and its convex hull .",
    "the latter is depicted as an ellipse in figure  [ sets ] .",
    "the numerical study of the sets @xmath12 , @xmath23 and @xmath22 is much more convoluted than that of their convexifications @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , most of this article is devoted to the numerical analysis of the latter .",
    "if we reflex a bit about the previous definitions , it will soon be clear that the above sets of correlations can only be distinguished experimentally in a black box way if the @xmath11 scenario is such that @xmath24 .",
    "otherwise , by forcing alice and bob to send orthogonal states , charlie could always infer the values of @xmath25 through an appropriate projective measurement , and so _ any _ conceivable distribution @xmath9 could be classically realized .",
    "the simplest scenario where we may expect to find an interesting structure is thus the 322 scenario . and ,",
    "indeed , the next example shows that there the sets @xmath12 and @xmath23 differ from @xmath22 .",
    "it also proves that neither of the former two sets is convex , and so the convexifications @xmath26 are non - trivial .",
    "consider the 322 scenario , and denote by @xmath27 the matrix of probabilities @xmath28 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath29    this set of probabilities can be attained if the states @xmath30 and the povm element @xmath31 correspond to @xmath32 @xmath33    where @xmath34 .",
    "it hence follows that @xmath35 .",
    "we will prove that @xmath17 must be an entangling measure ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) by _ reductio ad absurdum_. imagine , therefore , that @xmath17 is separable , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "then , the condition @xmath38 implies that : 1 ) @xmath39 or @xmath40 ( or both ) is a pure quantum state ; and 2 ) there exists a subset of indices @xmath41 such that m=_i_i_1^+_i_i_1^. [ decomp ]    here @xmath42 denotes @xmath43 , for any qubit state @xmath44 . from @xmath45",
    "we have that @xmath46 , and thus @xmath47 .",
    "likewise , @xmath48 , for all @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that @xmath50    for some @xmath51 .",
    "the condition @xmath52 therefore requires that @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , so m=_i_i_1^_2^+_i_i_2^_1^. [ decomp2 ]    using this last decomposition , we get @xmath55    with @xmath56 . but",
    "@xmath57 , from which it follows that @xmath17 is indeed entangling . actually , it is possible to obtain a non - linear witness to detect @xmath17 s entanglement if we just follow the previous steps carefully while keeping track of the approximation errors ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we have thus proven that @xmath36 , i.e. , the matrix of probabilities @xmath27 can not be observed if only unentangled measurements are allowed .",
    "however , the matrix @xmath58 can be expressed as a convex combination of four deterministic classical strategies .",
    "indeed , @xmath59    the sets @xmath60 are hence not convex , since otherwise @xmath27 would belong to them . allowing the three parties to have shared randomness thus leads to a radically different scenario .",
    "since convex sets can be completely characterized by systems of linear inequalities , it is legitimate to investigate how different linear constraints on @xmath13 of the form @xmath62 may be violated by elements of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this leads us to the problem of maximizing quantities like @xmath63 over all possible povm elements @xmath17 in the unentangled or the general class , and over all qubit states @xmath64 and @xmath65 so as to get the values @xmath66 and @xmath67 . clearly , if @xmath68 for some matrix @xmath69 , then there exist experimental situations where one can prove that the statistics observed in the lab can not be simulated with unentangled measurements and shared randomness .",
    "numerical optimization to obtain @xmath66 is carried out very similarly to the iterative algorithm used in @xcite .",
    "the steps are the following :    1 .   generate some random pure qubit states @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath70 .",
    "2 .   in dimension @xmath71 , for fixed states @xmath72 , maximizing eq .",
    "( [ maxi ] ) reduces to a semidefinite problem : define thus @xmath73 , and maximize @xmath74 , subject to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 denotes partial transposition @xcite .",
    "3 .   fix @xmath17 and @xmath65 and maximize @xmath77 for @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this amounts to find the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath80 with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath81 for each @xmath6 .",
    "4 .   for fixed @xmath17 and @xmath64 ,",
    "the optimal @xmath65 can be found such as @xmath64 in step 3 .",
    "if convergence has not been achieved , go back to step 2 .",
    "this optimization algorithm may encounter several local optima , therefore we must iterate it many times in order to ascertain with reasonable confidence that the largest maximum has been found . in sections",
    "[ sec322 ] and [ sec422 ] the semidefinite programs described in step 2 were solved using the sedumi package @xcite .",
    "a very similar procedure can be applied if we wish to inquire about the maximal value @xmath67 which can be achieved within the class of general quantum measurements .",
    "the only difference is in step 2 , where we have to maximize @xmath74 subject to the only constraint @xmath82 .",
    "however , in this case the maximum for a fixed @xmath83 can be easily found by diagonalization @xmath84 , resulting in the optimal @xmath85 .",
    "thereby the optimization algorithm for the case of entangled measurements is much faster .",
    "we next describe the way linear witnesses were produced for entangled measurements .",
    "our starting point is the classical polytope @xmath13 for the @xmath86 scenario , consisting of 104 extremal points in dimension 9 .",
    "all its facets can be enumerated by using the double description method implemented in fukuda s cdd package @xcite .",
    "the polytope @xmath13 has 1230 facets ; among them , 9 describe positivity facets @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the rest of them define non - trivial inequalities @xmath69 . however , most of them are equivalent under the following operations ,    * permuting alice s inputs @xmath6 * permuting bob s inputs @xmath7 * exchanging parties alice and bob * multiplying by @xmath89 all coefficients @xmath90 of the matrix @xmath69 .",
    "it turns out that there are 13 inequivalent facets of the polytope @xmath13",
    ". those are listed in table  [ table1 ] , where we also give the maximum classical value @xmath91 , the value @xmath66 achievable with unentangled measurements , the value @xmath67 attainable with general measurements , and the number of vertices lying on the particular facet .",
    "we must stress that the values for @xmath66 and @xmath67 come from numerical optimization , and so only local optimality is guaranteed .",
    "nevertheless , due to the small dimensionality of the problem and the number of iterations of the main algorithm , we are quite confident about their overall optimality as well .",
    "interestingly , we found that in each of the 13 cases @xmath66 could be achieved with rank-2 projective measurement operators .",
    "0.2truecm    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    to conclude this section , the @xmath92 scenario gave us a few new entangled measurement witnesses over the single witness of ( [ wit322 ] ) of the @xmath86 scenario .",
    "however , no significant improvement could be found in the efficiency of detecting entangled measurements with respect to unentangled measurements .",
    "also , no simple generalization of inequality  ( [ wit322 ] ) for larger input alphabets was discovered among the @xmath92 inequalities .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how to translate the concept of witnessing entangled measurements to the device - independent arena . we found that even in a black - box scenario it is possible for a theorist to assert that a joint demolition measurement can not be simulated with any sequence of local measurements assisted by classical communication : the only assumption one has to rely on is the dimensionality of the probe states . following this line of thought , we derived correlation inequalities which allow to test the superiority of entangled measurements over unentangled ones in two - qubit experiments where 9 ( secs .",
    "[ nonlin],[sec322 ] ) and 16 correlation terms ( sec .  [ sec422 ] ) are estimated .",
    "previous routes to certify the ` non - locality ' of unknown measuring devices involved carrying out complete tomography of their associated povm elements @xcite , or envisaging a state discrimination problem where entangled measurements have an advantage with respect to unentangled ones @xcite . either scheme has been conducted experimentally @xcite with success . both approaches , though , relied crucially on a detailed knowledge of the probe states to be measured , and so their conclusions can not be considered definite .",
    "in contrast , in this article we have proven that the experimental inaccuracies arising from an imperfect preparation of the probe states can be completely eliminated by certifying entangled measurements within a black box approach .",
    "given the simplicity of our inequalities , we thus propose their experimental implementation as an interesting challenge .",
    "we thank david prez - garca for valuable discussions .",
    "this work has been supported by a jnos bolyai programme of the hungarian academy of sciences and by the european project quevadis .",

    "this implies that there exist two indices @xmath127 , such that either ( 1+_j , k ) [ alter1 ]                                99 j.s .",
