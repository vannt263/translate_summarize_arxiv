    "in the standard model ( sm)@xcite , the higgs mechanism@xcite leads to the prediction of the higgs boson .",
    "the higgs boson is an excitation of the higgs field , which is an essential ingredient and will provide direct evidence for the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the sm without the higgs boson is incomplete since it predicts massless fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "however , the direct detection of higgs boson is difficult because it couples most strongly to the heaviest available channels which will cascade into complicated multiparticle final states . on the 4th of july 2012 , after a long wait and even generations of immense efforts by thousands of scientists , cern announced that both the atlas@xcite and cms@xcite experiments had discovered a new higgs - like boson , which was a historical event for high - energy physics .",
    "the large hadron collider(lhc ) experiments will determine various properties of the higgs boson , up to now , most measurements of this new particle are consistent with the sm prediction .",
    "this corners the new physics that affects the higgs couplings to a decoupling region @xcite . due to the clean environment",
    ", the complete profile of the higgs boson can be precisely studied at an electron - positron linear collider@xcite . in @xmath10 collider , there are two main production mechanisms for the sm higgs boson : higgs - strahlung and @xmath11-fusion . compared with @xmath11-fusion ,",
    "the cross section for the similar @xmath12-fusion process is suppressed by one order of magnitude .",
    "these processes have been studied at @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 modes in the context of the sm@xcite and the new physics models@xcite .    as an extension of the sm , the littlest higgs model with t - parity(lht)@xcite",
    "can successfully solve the electroweak hierarchy problem and so far remains a popular candidate of new physics .",
    "in the lht model , some new particles are predicted and some sm couplings are modified so that the higgs properties may deviate from the sm higgs boson .",
    "so the higgs - boson production processes are ideal ways to probe the lht model at the high energy colliders .",
    "these production processes in the lht model have been studied at the lhc@xcite , but have not been calcualted at the @xmath10 colliders . in this work",
    ", we will study the single higgs production processes , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in the lht model at the @xmath10 collider .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give a brief review of the lht model related to our work .",
    "in sec.iii we study the effects of the lht model in the single higgs boson production and present some discussions of numerical results .",
    "finally , we give a short summary in sec.iv .",
    "in this section , we only review the lht model related to our calculations . for more details",
    ", one can refer to refs.@xcite .",
    "the lht model was based on a non - linear @xmath15 model describing an @xmath16 symmetry breaking , with the global group @xmath17 being spontaneously broken into @xmath18 by a @xmath19 symmetric tensor at the scale @xmath20(tev ) .",
    "an @xmath21_{1}\\times[su(2)\\times u(1)]_{2}$ ] subgroup of the @xmath17 is gauged and the gauge fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 are introduced . in this model ,",
    "the action of t - parity on the gauge fields and scalar sector are defined as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the t - odd and t - even gauge fields can be obtained as @xmath27    the electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath28 takes place via the usual higgs mechanism .",
    "the mass eigenstates of the gauge fields are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the usual weinberg angle and @xmath31 is the mixing angle defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 gev is the sm higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .    to implement t - parity in the fermion sector",
    ", it requires the introduction of the mirror fermions . for each sm @xmath34 doublet , under the @xmath35 gauge symmetry ,",
    "a doublet under @xmath36 and one under @xmath37 are introduced .",
    "the t - parity even combination is associated with the sm @xmath34 doublet while the t - odd combination is given a @xmath38 mass .    in order to avoid dangerous contributions to the higgs mass from one - loop quadratic divergences",
    ", the third generation yukawa sector must be modified .",
    "one must also introduce additional singlets @xmath39 and @xmath40 which transform under t - parity as @xmath41 so the top sector masses can be generated in the following t - parity invariant way @xmath42 u_{3r } \\nonumber\\\\&- & \\lambda_2 f ( \\bar{t}'_1 t'_{1r } + \\bar{t}'_2 t'_{2r})+ h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the other quarks , it will not be necessary to modify the yukawa lagrangian as in the top sector since their yukawa coupling is at least one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "therefore we do not need to introduce additional singlets for the remaining up - type quarks and the yukawa coupling is accordingly given by @xmath43 u_r+h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the down - type quarks , we can construct the yukawa interaction to give them masses in the following way : @xmath44 d_r + h.c.\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in our calculations , the @xmath45 and @xmath46 coupling involved will be different from the sm coupling , which are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "although the differences occur at the order @xmath49 , their contributions can not be ignored because they appear at the lowest - order .",
    "in the lht model , the lowest - order feynman diagrams of the process @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "we can see that the tree - level feynman diagrams of these processes in the lht model are identical with that in the sm .    in our numerical calculations ,",
    "the sm parameters are taken as follows@xcite @xmath50    there is only one lht parameter , the breaking scale @xmath51 , in our calculation .",
    "considering the constraints in refs.@xcite , we choose the relatively relaxed parameter space and vary the scale in the range @xmath52 gev@xmath53 gev .    in fig.2(a ) , we show the dependance of the production cross section @xmath15 on the center - of - mass energy @xmath54 for the scale @xmath55 gev in the lht model .",
    "we present @xmath3 , @xmath56 and @xmath6 production channels , respectively .",
    "we can see that the @xmath3 production cross section dominates at low center - of - mass energies , the corresponding cross section increases sharply at the threshold and then decreases with the center - of - mass energy in proportion to @xmath57 .",
    "the region of cross section maximum is around @xmath58 gev and the maximum value can reach about 230 fb .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 production cross section increases with the center - of - mass energy in proportion to log@xmath59 and hence becomes more important at energies @xmath60 gev .",
    "after the discovery of the higgs - like boson at the lhc , in order to study the properties of this new particle with high precision , many schemes of the so - called higgs factory have been proposed @xcite .",
    "for example , the proposed lep3 or china higgs factory ( chf ) with a center - of - mass energy 240 gev , the tlep with a center - of - mass energy 350 gev , the ilc with a center - of - mass energy 500 gev , and so on . in tab.i",
    ", we display the lowest - order dominant higgs boson production cross section in the lht model for different higgs factories .",
    ".dominant higgs - boson production cross section in the lht model at various center - of - mass energies of the @xmath10 collision for @xmath55 gev , @xmath61 gev .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig.2(b ) , we show the dependance of the relative correction @xmath62 on the scale @xmath51 for the center - of - mass energy @xmath8 gev .",
    "we present the relative correction @xmath62 of @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 production channels , respectively .",
    "we can see that the relative correction @xmath62 decreases with the scale @xmath51 increasing , which means that the correction of the lht model decouples with the scale @xmath51 increasing .",
    "for the three production channels , the relative corrections @xmath62 are all negative and each of them can maximally reach @xmath63 when the scale @xmath64 gev . moreover , we can see that the behaviors of the three production channels are similar due to the similar lht correction to the @xmath65 and @xmath46 couplings .    by combining the higgs data from the lhc and",
    "electroweak precise measurements , the authors in ref.@xcite get the constraint on the scale @xmath51 in the lht model , that is , @xmath66 gev at @xmath67 cl . the direct searches for the new particles can also provide constraints on the scale @xmath51 , but these bounds can be weaken by the small @xmath68 .",
    "so , if we require the scale @xmath66 gev , the relative correction @xmath62 of @xmath3 production can maximally reach @xmath4 and the relative corrections @xmath69 of @xmath5 and @xmath6 production can both maximally reach @xmath7 .    by exploiting the @xmath70 channel ,",
    "the @xmath0 production cross sections at @xmath71 gev with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath72 can be measured with statistical errors of @xmath73 for higgs - boson masses from 120 to 160 gev@xcite .",
    "if the center - of - mass energy is upgraded to 500 gev at a linear @xmath10 collider , this will allow to measure the higgs production cross sections at the level of a few percent@xcite .",
    "so , the lht effects can be tested at the future @xmath10 colliders with a high luminosity .    in order to provide more information of the single higgs - boson production , we display some kinematical distributions of final states by using madgraph5@xcite . in fig.4",
    ", we show the distributions of the production process @xmath0 for @xmath8 gev , @xmath74 gev .",

    "we can see that the peak of the @xmath81 is at @xmath82 , the peak of the missing energy is at @xmath83 gev , and the peak of the total transverse energy is at @xmath84 gev .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath80 for the two b - jets is different , one peak is at @xmath85 gev and the other peak is at @xmath86 gev .    in fig.5 , we show the distributions of production process @xmath87 for @xmath8 gev , @xmath74 gev .",

    "we display @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the lht and the sm , respectively .",
    "we can see that the peak of the @xmath89 is at @xmath91 , which means that the two b - jets incline to fly back - to - back .",
    "the peak of the missing energy is at @xmath92 gev , and the peak of the total transverse energy is at @xmath93 gev .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath80 for the two b - jets is different , one peak is at @xmath94 gev and the other peak is at @xmath95 gev .    from fig.4 and fig.5",
    ", we can see that the behaviour of the relevant distributions in the lht model is similar to that in the sm , and the lht correction can obviously reduce the sm differential cross section at around the peak .",
    "in this paper , we studied the single higgs - boson production at @xmath10 colliders in the lht model .",
    "the main production channels , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , have been taken into account .",
    "we calculated the production cross section and the relative correction at the tree level .",
    "considering the latest constraints , we found that the relative correction of the @xmath3 production channel can reach @xmath4 and the relative corrections of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 production channels can both reach @xmath7 for @xmath8 gev with the lower limit of the scale @xmath51(=694 gev ) , which is large enough for people to detect the lht effects at the future @xmath10 colliders . in order to investigate the observability ,",
