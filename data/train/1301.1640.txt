    "in the present work we investigate the response of the physical vacuum ( pv ) of qed to the influence of a time dependent , strong periodic electric field ( `` laser field '' ) in a wide range of field parameters , i.e. , the field strength amplitude @xmath1 and the wavelength @xmath0 ( we use the natural units @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the boltzmann constant ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the so - called critical or sauter - schwinger field strength , and @xmath9 is the compton wavelength of elementary leptons with mass @xmath10 and electric charge @xmath11 ( we focus here on electrons and positrons ) ; @xmath12 m . to characterize the pv response we use either the distribution function or the number density of quasiparticle electron - positron pairs ( epps ) created from the pv .",
    "below we select three characteristic domains in the plane spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath0 : the region of non - increasing creation ( dubbed `` calm valley '' ) and two boundary regions of accumulation , where the epp density increases up to saturation ( for sufficient duration of the field ) .",
    "the accumulation regions correspond to limiting high fields @xmath13 ( and @xmath14 ) or limiting short wavelengths @xmath15 ( and @xmath16 ) .",
    "of course , there is also a region where these accumulation domains do overlap .",
    "different mechanisms of vacuum creation act in these domains and provide the corresponding features of the pv response .",
    "the vacuum excitations in the calm valley can be described perturbatively while nonperturbative approaches are necessary in both accumulation domains . in the following ,",
    "we consider the action of a periodical field .",
    "but the obtained results allow also to estimate the role of separate fourier components of an external field with complicated spectral structure ( as , e.g. , in the cases of vacuum epp creation by scattering of charged particles at high energies @xcite and the dynamical casimir effect @xcite ) .",
    "the methodical basis of our analysis is a system of kinetic equations ( kes ) which is a nonperturbative consequence of qed in the presence of a spatially homogeneous , time dependent electric field @xcite .",
    "these kes are intended for the description of the dynamical schwinger effect of vacuum particle creation in terms of quasiparticle vacuum excitations , having the quantum numbers of the electron and positron in the presence of an external field ( mass , charge , quasi - momentum and quasi - energy ) , which are called below as quasiparticles .",
    "after the ceasing of the laser pulse some of these quasiparticles become real electrons and positrons with their momentum and energy lying on the mass shell .",
    "thus , in the present work , vacuum polarization effects and vacuum particle creation in the time - dependent electric field of a standing wave formed in the focal spot of counter - propagating strong laser fields are analyzed in the framework of the quasiparticle representation .",
    "such a quasiparticle picture corresponds to the level of description with real epps in the out - channel . on the other hand ,",
    "the information about quasiparticle distributions is useful for different estimates of the secondary observable effects such as the generation of pair annihilation photons @xcite , the birefringence effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) and so on .",
    "the additional investigation of the residual epp surviving after the ceasing of the laser pulse will be given elsewhere .",

    "the actuality of development of a nonperturbative kinetic theory of vacuum epp creation for the case of non - quasiclassical external electromagnetic fields is emphasized for cases where the quantum field fluctuations are essential .",
    "it is also shown that both accumulation domains are promising for an experimental observation of the dynamical schwinger effect .",
    "it is well known that vacuum particle creation in strong electromagnetic fields is possible if one or both of the field invariants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are non - vanishing @xcite .",
    "such conditions can be realized , e.g. , in the focal spot of two or more counter - propagating laser beams , where the electric field is spatially homogeneous over distances @xmath19 and time dependent .",
    "for very strong fields @xmath20 one can then expect the creation of a real electron - positron plasma @xcite out of the electromagnetically polarized pv . in the subcritical field regime @xmath21 the question is mainly about the creation of a short - lived quasiparticle epp that exists during the course of the field action ( the dynamical schwinger effect ) @xcite .",

    "below it will be shown that the features in the behavior of the pv response for the weak field case @xmath46 become apparent just in the q domain , where the applicability of ke ( [ ke ] ) breaks down .",
    "an exception is the strong field domain @xmath47 , where the inequality ( [ qc ] ) is valid .",
    "however , in spite of this , we will investigate its solutions here assuming that the external field can be treated as some quasiclassical background .",

    "this way of switching on the external periodical field is rather standard in the framework of the discussed problem @xcite .",
    "below we will consider also the method of adiabatic field switching on . generally speaking , the obtained results depend on the way of the field switching on . this is due to the occurrence of high harmonics in the solution spectrum of the ke ( [ ke ] ) . as a rule , the high harmonics , which accompany the fast ( non - adiabatic ) switching on of a laser field ,",
    "have no essential influence on the solution spectrum .    for a comparative investigation of epp production",

    "[ fig_feq ] demonstrates the similarity of the distributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( [ feq ] ) and the relation for the temperatures @xmath78 .",
    "however , a more satisfactory approximation for the pair distribution function is @xmath79 the difference between the distributions ( [ feq ] ) and ( [ om6 ] ) appears in the high - energy tails .",
    "the estimate ( [ om6 ] ) can be obtained on the basis of the ke ( [ ke ] ) in the low density approximation in the multiphoton domain @xmath50 ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : low ] ) . in the framework of the approximation ( [ feq ] )",
    "the temperature parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 are universal and do not depend on the laser field parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in these assumptions the distributions ( [ feq ] ) and ( [ om6 ] ) are independent of the wavelength @xmath0 and proportional to @xmath80",
    ". moreover , in the initial stage these estimates remain valid regardless of the form of the electric field pulse .",
    "this holds in particular for the sauter potential , where the solution is well known @xcite .",
    "the excitation mechanism of the anisotropic spectrum of epps in the early stage of the evolution is fully determined by the dynamics of vacuum creation and , specifically , by the structure of the amplitude ( [ 3 ] ) . there",
    "the anisotropy effects are represented by both , the transverse energy @xmath81 and the quasienergy @xmath35 .",
    "the same anisotropy factor @xmath82 can be obtained on the basis of the distribution ( [ om6 ] ) , when the relation of derivatives of the projections @xmath83 and @xmath84 with respect to @xmath85 and @xmath86 is considered .",
    "thus , in the case of a short pulse , the anisotropic distributions ( [ feq ] ) and ( [ om6 ] ) will lead to an elliptic flow of epps , which is compressed in the direction of the electric field .",
    "the estimates ( [ feq ] ) and ( [ om6 ] ) are modified when other mechanisms of vacuum creation of fermions are realized ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can lead to a change of the anisotropy factor @xmath87 .",
    "considering , instead of fermions , the case of bosons , the situation changes radically : the equilibrium - like distributions of the type ( [ feq ] ) and ( [ om6 ] ) are replaced by the ones for strong nonequilibrium @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_bose ] .    .",
    "[ fig_bose],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    thus , one can say that the initial distribution of the particles created from vacuum is well defined in the general case .",
    "in particular , the conclusion about the existence of equilibrium - like universal distributions can become important for the theory of quark - gluon plasma generation in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "apparently , the temperature parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 can not be interpreted as the unruh temperature @xmath88 @xcite , since the acceleration @xmath89 would imply a field dependence of @xmath73 and @xmath74 which is not observed in our numerical investigations .",
    "some anisotropic initial distributions of particles created from vacuum under the action of an electric field have been introduced long ago ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but they have artificial character .    while a parametrization of the distribution function resulting from the ke ( [ ke ] ) by a boltzmann distribution may be a covenient characterization at certain time instances and in restricted intervals of momenta or energies , the concept of temperature in the usual thermodynamical or statistical sense is obviously not applicable . in the present example , it is the strong anisotropy which signals a striking off - equilibrium situation not accessible by equilibrium or near - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "such a simplifying picture of the phenomena in the calm valley is valid approximately in the initial stage of the process for @xmath90 .",
    "the high frequency harmonics become essential at @xmath91 and the structure of the distribution function gets very complex .",
    "however , the amplitude estimate remains valid and the epp production rate averaged over a period ( i.e. , the pair creation per unit time ) is absent , @xmath92 . the dependence @xmath93 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmax - e0 ] reveals that in the whole calm valley domain holds @xmath94 up to the strong field accumulation region ( the shaded area `` f '' in that figure ) where the numerical calculation is complicated .",

    "[ fig_accum ] , dashed line ) .     in the weak field regime evidencing the transition from the oscillating mode for @xmath96 nm to the linearly growing ( in the mean ) mode at @xmath97 nm . the latter behaviour is termed here as `` accumulation '' .",

    "[ sec : low ] .",
    "the residual number density of epp is very small in comparison with the breathing mode .",
    "the calm valley is bounded from above and to the left by the two accumulation domains f and r ( see fig .  [",

    "thus , in the multiphoton domain of the calm valley the averaged production rate @xmath98 of epp is negligibly small .",
    "instead , there are vacuum oscillations induced by the external field and the small constant ( residual ) component . in principle",
    ", these vacuum effects can lead to some observable effects .",
    "for instance , they influence on the propagation of an electromagnetic probe signal .",
    "this can result in an anomalous absorption of this signal at the frequency @xmath175 .",
    "the perturbation theory used here in the quasiparticle representation is valid in the multiphoton domain @xmath50 , when the swing amplitude ( sect .",
    "[ sec : pv ] ) is small .",
    "however , the numerical solutions of the ke ( [ ke ] ) show that these results are valid also in some parts of the tunneling mechanism region . at first glance",
    ", this fact is unexpected . indeed , in this region for subcritical fields @xmath46 it is very well known that the epp production rate is exponentially small @xcite . but this effect is not accessible to perturbation theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the domain of the long wavelength limit @xmath176 is difficult for the numerical analysis and it was not studied in the present work .",
    "it is possible , that some special solution of ke ( [ ke ] ) is present here which is compatible with the well known estimates @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have described the pv response to a monochromatic laser radiation in the landscape of the laser parameters ( [ 01 ] ) and ( [ 02 ] ) .",
    "three specific domains were observed here    * the domain of the vacuum oscillations induced by the external field ( calm valley ) , where the epp production rate is very small , @xmath92 , and the breathing modes are acting only , * the domain of the accumulation effect due to strong field ( f ) , and * the resonant ( r ) accumulation domain , where the epp production rate can reach significant values .",
    "thus , it was shown that the behavior of the pv in the calm valley up to a certain critical point @xmath177 is stable and does not depend on the wavelength @xmath0 of the external electromagnetic field .",
    "this domain accommodates different mechanisms of vacuum decay into quasiparticle epp excitations    * tunneling ( @xmath178 , when the photon number of the external field is infinity or very large ) , * multiphoton processes ( @xmath179 ) and * few - photon processes .",
    "the accumulation effect depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape ] , appears just either in the multiphoton domain as a parametric resonance induced by the one - photon mechanism of epp creation at the frequency @xmath101 ( domain r ) or as a result of the acceleration of quasiparticle @xmath2 pairs in a subcritical external field ( domain f ) .",
    "these processes are accompanied by the accumulation of epp density and are limited by the condition @xmath180 . for increasing @xmath1 , the domain of the momentum space covered by the distribution function",
    "is enlarged too ( `` broadening '' of @xmath26 , see fig .",
    "[ degen ] ) .",
    "this can lead to a rapid growth of the epp density .    for the strong and moderately strong fields ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape ] ) these predictions are based on a realistic ke ( [ ke ] ) in the scope of its applicability . for sufficiently small fields , @xmath46 ,",
    "the accumulation r - domain comes in the region of the strongly fluctuating external fields , where the ke ( [ ke ] ) is not applicable , generally speaking , and its solutions have here only exploratory character .",
    "as the epp density under the accumulation conditions in the r domain can be very high even for relatively weak fields , @xmath46 , it can be expected that the manifestation of the dynamical schwinger effect can be quite possible in this domain due to the generation of secondary effects such as , e.g. , the radiation of annihilation photons .",
    "apparently , these remarks can be useful for the discussion of possible experiments for observing the dynamical schwinger effect .",
    "on the other hand , the accumulation effect in the both accumulation domains r and f in the short - wavelength domain can be considerable only for a sufficiently long duration of the laser field action @xmath91 ( figs .",
    "[ fig_accum ] , [ degen ] and [ gauss ] ) .",
    "this circumstance makes difficult an experimental observation of the effect in the case of a short single laser pulse .    in the theory of vacuum epp creation under the action of a periodic laser field of the type ( [ field ] )",
    "the residual epp density is the basic final product of the theory .",
    "however , its definition can be difficult . in the present work the residual density",
    "is understood , as a rule , as the epp density at the final moment of action of some field periods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it corresponds to the density @xmath181 ( [ 15 ] ) . in such a case",
    "it is implied that the field ( [ field ] ) either prolongs to act farther than the periodical field or it switches off instantly .",
    "both these cases are rather artificial .",
    "it would be more satisfactory to consider some pulsed field of the type ( [ 10a ] ) , when a periodical field switches on and off gradually or adiabatically .",
    "the similar situation was discussed in the sect .",
    "[ sec : pv ] .",
    "it is very important that it does not lead to qualitative change in the picture for moderate fields thus demonstrating the stability of the obtained results with respect to the way of switching the laser field on and off .",
    "let us underline also that the approach used in the present work is based on a minimal number of very general assumptions ( spatial homogeneity of the external field and its linear polarisation ) and is in essence an exact consequence of the basic qed in the framework of these limitations .",
    "this circumstance allows the authors to express the opinion that the obtained results in the framework of the given approach are free from some additional approximation ( e.g. , of the wkb type ) and therefore a more trustworthy in the qc - domain .",
    "moreover , they allow to make first prognoses for the q - domain . on the other hand ,",
    "the basic kinetic equation ( ke ) ( [ ke ] ) is valid in the case of a quasiclassical electric field ( [ field ] ) only .",
    "we extrapolated the domain of its applicability into the q domain .",
    "the foundation for such an extrapolation is the assumption that the solution of the ke ( [ ke ] ) in the boundary domain is valid approximately because there the quantum fluctuations of the electric field are not too large .",
    "thus , we observe here the tendency to a non - monotonicity described above . in the q domain the external field can be described with the help of the corresponding density matrix of the electromagnetic field .",
    "then , the quasiclassical field @xmath182 will play the role of a background field , i.e. @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the field operator of the photon component of the total field @xmath185 .    for a more adequate investigation of the pv response in the q domain",
    "it is necessary to develop a kinetic theory for the generalization of the ke ( [ ke ] ) taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the electric field . for understanding the situation , we mention the works @xcite in which the vacuum particle creation is considered under the influence of a stochastic time dependent electric field . we want to mention two of the possibilities which emerge here .",
    "the compressed state of the electromagnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) is a quantum one but contains a large occupation number of photons . as a result",
    ", the criterion ( 6 ) of the quasiclassical case can be not adequate to this situation .",
    "for the second example we remark that , in the case of a rather strong field @xmath186 , the backreaction mechanism becomes essential and leads to a stochastic ( or close to one ) internal electric field @xcite .",
    "thus , the kinetic description of vacuum particle creation in the q domain is an actual problem deserving further investigation .",
    "considering the muon pv independently of @xmath2 pv , it can be expected that the response of the @xmath187 pv will repeat on the qualitative level the picture described in sect .",
    "[ sec : pv ] with a shift to the side of shorter waves .",
    "two regions in the plane of the parameters ( [ 01 ] ) and ( [ 02 ] ) remain uninvestigated in the framework of the used approach : the top left corner on fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape ] where short wavelengths and strong fields simultaneously persist , and the right boundary of the tunneling domain in the calm valley where @xmath188 .",
    "it would be worthwhile to investigte these areas separately .",
    "preliminary results of this work have been reported recently @xcite and a more elaborate discussion is in preparation .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the quasiparticle epp generated from the pv under the action of a strong laser field .",
    "it was shown that particle production in the initial stage of the field action is characterized by an equilibrium like `` thermal '' distribution . however , at later times the quasiparticle epp distribution becomes very complicated and shows a far - from - equilibrium behaviour with distinct features depending on the specific domain of the landscape . in the subsequent , second part of the work we plan to investigate features of the real epp which remains after the laser pulse ceases .",
    "moreover , the transient phenomenona between quasiparticle and residual states of the epp shall be studied .",
