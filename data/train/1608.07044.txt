    "the pt law is a theorem for invariant ensembles in the limit @xmath11 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for physical problems like nuclear resonances its applicability",
    "is not guaranteed and requires experimental verification .",
    "older experiments ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) were in reasonable good agreement with this law .",
    "nevertheless , recent experimental results and more careful treatment of old results demonstrate a clear disagreement with the thomas - porter distribution @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as rm theory is one of cornerstones of quantum chaos in nuclear physics , it is important to understand the origin of the discrepancy .",
    "different scenarios had been proposed so far ( see @xcite-@xcite among others ) .    after a careful analysis",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite came to the conclusion that a realistic model of nuclear @xmath12-wave resonances should include in addition to rm term a rank - one interaction which couples resonances to decay channels and they argued that the effective hamiltonian matrix can be chosen in the form @xmath13 here @xmath14 is either a @xmath15 real symmetric random matrix ( @xmath5 ) or a complex hermitian one ( @xmath6 ) with the gaussian distribution @xmath16 to get a nontrivial limit it is assumed that the ratio of the coupling constant @xmath17 to the mean level density @xmath18 remains constant when @xmath11 .",

    "the main result of the paper is that random variable @xmath1 given by eq .",
    "has the same functional form as the pt distribution ( eqs .   and ) but with important difference that @xmath8 ( and , consequently , the mean value of @xmath1 ) in these expressions is not an universal constant but a certain function of state energy @xmath23 and dimensionless coupling constant @xmath24 ( see eq .  ) .",

    "section  [ probability ] is devoted to the derivation of exact joint distribution of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of matrix @xmath25 in eq .  .",
    "it is demonstrated that for any rank - one perturbation such distribution equals the unperturbed joint distribution of invariant matrix @xmath26 without the confinement term .",
    "it is the change of the confinement potential which mixes eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and makes the problem rotational non - invariant .",

    "the reason of it is well known and is related with the formation for @xmath28 of one collective state well separated from the bulk with highest ( when @xmath92 ) or smallest ( when @xmath93 ) energy .",
    "this state manifests itself as an additional pole eq .",
