    "it was found that , if the amplitude of the incident soliton is too small , it bounces back from the db . beyond a specific threshold amplitude ,",
    "a part of the norm of the incident solitary pulse may be transmitted through the db .",
    "in particular , this transport property is vital for matter - wave interferometry @xcite and quantum - information processing @xcite .",
    "previous works were mainly dealing with symmetric dbs in perfect lattices , the corresponding transfer mechanism being symmetric with respect to the direction of motion of the incident excitation . on the other hand , unidirectional propagation of waves in specially devised systems",
    "has drawn much attention too ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , it was experimentally demonstrated that a periodically poled waveguide may serve as an optical diode @xcite .",
    "further , it was predicted that a combination of a bragg grating with a periodic lattice built of gain and loss elements @xcite , as well as a periodically structured metamaterial @xcite , a chain of driven ultracold atoms atomic - chain - uni , and chains of coupled microcavities @xcite may give rise to nonreciprocal light transmission .",
    "starting from early work scalora , it was also demonstrated theoretically that photonic crystals ( pcs ) with edge modes @xcite , pcs with built - in periodic lattices of defects @xcite , second - harmonic - generating pcs @xcite , and quasiperiodic pcs @xcite , may produce a similar effect .",
    "other theoretically predicted and experimentally realized possibilities for the unidirectional light transmission are offered by @xmath0-symmetric photonic lattices @xcite .",
    "asymmetric propagation of microwaves micro - uni and electric signals @xcite was observed , respectively , in appropriately built electromagnetic crystals and electric transmission lines .",
    "realistic lattices always contain imperfections ( defects ) .",
    "in many cases , they dramatically affect the properties of lattices carrying onsite nonlinearities , resulting in a number of new phenomena , such as anderson localization @xcite , intraband discrete breathers @xcite , and the disorder - induced bose - glass phase lfallani2007 .",
    "the influence of disorder on the lattice transport was widely investigated too .",
    "it was demonstrated , in various settings , that the interplay of the disorder with self - defocusing nonlinearity may replace the localization by subdiffusion @xcite .",
    "more subtle dynamical regimes , represented by infinite - dimensional kolmogorov - arnold - moser tori , are possible too @xcite .",
    "unlike those works , our subject here is modification of the lattice transport by dbs pinned to local defects . in particular ,",
    "if defects have an asymmetric shape , they asymmetrically deform pinned lattice solitons ( alias discrete breathers ) @xcite , making them _ tilted _ discrete breathers ( tdbs ) . in this work",
    ", we consider a one - dimensional discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) model with asymmetric defects and demonstrate that , while the underlying lattice admits bidirectional transmission of linear waves , the transmission may be made nonreciprocal for waves hitting a pinned tdb from opposite directions . as a result",
    ", we find a ",
    "diodelike \" transport mode , where the incident wave packets can pass through the tdb only in one direction , provided that the packet s energy falls into an appropriate interval between cases of full reflection and full passage ( for small and large energies , respectively ) .",
    "thus , while a localized asymmetric defect can not directly induce the unidirectional transmission , it may create such a regime with the help of the pinned tdb .",
    "this is possible because the scattering of waves on a soliton in a nonlinear system is essentially different from the scattering on a defect in the linear counterpart of the same system . in particular ,",
    "the nonlinearity gives rise to the interaction of the wave with its own complex - conjugate counterpart , which does not happen in the linear limit .",
    "the diode mode can be controlled by varying parameters of the underlying defect , as well as the amplitude ( i.e. , energy ) of the pinned tdb .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the model and produce tilted discrete breathers for dilute gases of bosonic atoms trapped in the deep ol . unidirectional transport of wave packets through the tdbs is reported in sec .",

    "we start by taking the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , which is the basic model that captures the dynamics of a dilute gas of bosonic atoms in the deep ol . in the mean - field approximation ,",

    ", @xmath22 is proportional to deviation of the local refractive index from its average value , and @xmath23 is the on - site amplitude of the electromagnetic wave in the spatial domain .    the transport of excitations through the db is mainly determined by the dynamics at three sites on which a narrow db is located .",

    "of course , the mean potential slope in such a tilted lattice will eventually give rise to reflection of any incident wave packet , in the absence of the tdb ; however , the respective reflection length is much larger than that induced by the tdb , hence the diode effect may plausibly remain discernible in the tilted lattice .    in fig .",

    "<S> we consider the transfer of lattice wave packets through a tilted discrete breather ( tdb ) in opposite directions in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger model with asymmetric defects , which may be realized as a bose - einstein condensate trapped in a deep optical lattice , or as optical beams in a waveguide array . </S>",
    "<S> a unidirectional transport mode is found , in which the incident wave packets , whose energy belongs to a certain interval between full reflection and full passage regions , pass the tdb only in one direction , while , in the absence of the tdb , the same lattice admits bi - directional propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the operation of this mode is accurately explained by an analytical consideration of the respective energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the tdb may emulate the unidirectional propagation of atomic and optical beams in various settings . in the case of the passage of the incident wave packet , the scattering tdb typically shifts by one lattice unit in the direction </S>",
