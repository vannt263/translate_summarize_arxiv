    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are , as of now , most popularly hypothesized as isolated , spinning down , highly magnetized neutron stars ( nss ) ( magnetar model ) @xcite .",
    "a ns of radius @xmath0 km with surface and central magnetic fields respectively @xmath1 g and @xmath2 g can have magnetic energy @xmath3erg , which could produce the luminosity @xmath4erg / sec , as observed for axps / sgrs , in its typical age . however , there are certain shortcomings in it .",
    "first of all , as of now , there is no evidence for a strongly magnetized ns  as strong as required for the magnetar model .",
    "second , recent fermi observations are inconsistent with predicted high energy gamma - ray emissions in the magnetars .",
    "third , inferred upper limit of @xmath5 for some magnetars , e.g. sgr  0418 + 5729 , is quite smaller than the field required to explain observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "fourth , the attempt to relate magnetars to the energies of supernova remnants or the formation of black holes is not viable .",
    "there are many more .",
    "these observations imply that the high magnetic dipole moment is not a mandatory condition for a magnetar .",
    "recently axps / sgrs have been argued @xcite to be magnetized white dwarfs ( wds ) , following the idea proposed decades back @xcite . due to their larger radius , the rotationally powered energy for wds could be quite larger than that for nss .",
    "hence , these authors attempted to explain the energy released in axps / sgrs through the occurrence of glitch and subsequent loss of the rotational energy . while this wd based model ( hereinafter c - wd ) does not need to invoke extraordinarily strong , unconfirmed observationally yet , magnetic field , it is challenged by the observed short spin periods ( e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "in addition , due to larger radius , they should exhibit larger ultra - violet ( uv ) luminosities , which however , suffer from a deep upper limits on the optical counterparts ( e.g. refs .  ) of some axps / sgrs , e.g. sgr  0418 + 5729 .",
    "recently , mukhopadhyay and his collaborators , in a series of papers , have proposed for the existence of highly magnetized wds ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) with mass significantly super - chandrasekhar .",
    "@xmath5 of such wds could be as high as @xmath6 g and @xmath7 could be @xmath8 orders of magnitude higher .",
    "these wds ( hereinafter b - wds ) are significantly smaller in size compared to their ordinary counterparts ( e.g. polar with @xmath9 g ) .",
    "their radius could even be an order or order and half of magnitude higher than that of a ns . as the surface temperatures of wds with different magnetic fields are not expected to differ significantly @xcite , smaller the radius ,",
    "smaller the luminosity of the wd is .",
    "b - wds should be consistent with the uv - luminosity ( @xmath10 ) cut - off in axps / sgrs . moreover , their typical @xmath5 is consistent with observations , but adequate to explain axp / sgr energies as rotationally / spin - down powered energy , unlike the ns based models and c - wds .    here",
    "we explore axps / sgrs as b - wds . although the evolution of b - wds was argued by accretion , they may appear as axps / sgrs at the exhaustion of mass supply after significant evolution .",
    "such wds @xmath5 and @xmath11 combination can easily explain axps / sgrs as rotationally powered wds .",
    "all the machineries implemented in the magnetar model can be applicable for b - wds as well , however , with a smaller @xmath5 which is physically more viable .",
    "hence , under the b - wd model , one does not necessarily need to invoke an extra - ordinarily source of magnetic energy  everything comes out naturally .",
    "we also show that the magnetic fields in b - wds are in accordance with the virial theorem , subject to its modification based on the magnetic pressure in the magnetostatic condition .",
    "the rate of energy loss from an oscillating magnetic dipole is @xmath12 when the variation of dipole moment @xmath13 arises due to a magnetic dipole having inclination angle @xmath14 with respect to its rotational axis , @xmath15 is the angular frequency of the dipole , @xmath16 the light speed . assuming the rotating , magnetized compact stars to be rotating magnetic dipole",
    ", the dipole nature of magnetic field is expressed as @xmath17 when @xmath11 is the radius of star .",
    "however , the above energy loss rate can be defined as the rate of rotational kinetic energy change of star with moment of inertia @xmath18 as @xmath19 which leads to @xmath20 when @xmath21 is the rotational period and @xmath22 the period derivative , @xmath23 , @xmath24 the mass of the compact star .",
    "note that @xmath25 and the proportionality constant depends on the nature of the matter and its distribution in the star and shape of the star .",
    "this is the upper limit of @xmath5 .",
    "as @xmath21 and @xmath22 for axps / sgrs are known from observations , @xmath5 can be computed for a given mass - radius ( @xmath26 ) relation when @xmath14 is a parameter .",
    "once @xmath5 is estimated for an observation , the rotational / dipole energy @xmath27 stored in the star can be computed .",
    "this further quantifies the maximum energy stored in it , if there is no other source as adopted in the magnetar model .",
    "we consider nine axps / sgrs explained as b - wds , listed in table  1 .",
    "we also assume the surface temperature of wds to be @xmath28 k with wds to be semi - solid sphere / ellipsoid .",
    "[ aba : tbl1 ]    figures [ fig]a and [ fig]b show that @xmath5 for the @xmath26 combination of the b - wds is quite stronger compared to that of the c - wds . also b - wds exhibit x - ray luminosity : @xmath29 , from eq .",
    "( [ edot ] ) , explaining all the axps / sgrs listed in table  1 as rotational powered pulsars .",
    "this naturally explains axps / sgrs without requiring an extra - ordinary source of magnetic energy .",
    "generally , higher the @xmath30 for a poloidal dominated field , higher the @xmath24 is , which corresponds to a lower @xmath11 and hence a lower @xmath10 .",
    "first note very importantly that in the presence of strong magnetic field , the upper limit of magnetic fields in wds , as discussed in , e.g. ref",
    ".   for weak field cases , has to be revised , the contribution of the magnetic pressure to the hydro / magnetostatic balance equation can not be neglected . here",
    "we attempt to revise so in a simpler / approximate framework .",
    "if the gravitational , thermal and magnetic energies are respectively denoted by @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then the scalar virial theorem can be read as @xmath34 where we consider , on average , the isotropic effects of averaged magnetic field @xmath35 and hence overall the star to be spherical in shape , @xmath21 is the pressure of the stellar matter , @xmath36 the averaged density , @xmath24 the mass of wd , @xmath37 the newton s gravitation constant .",
    "now we assume that a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) to be satisfied in entire star such that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the polytropic constants , and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the scalar virial theorem can be reduced to @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath14 , @xmath44 and @xmath40 are the constant factors determined by the shape and other properties of the star .    now combining first and second terms of eq .",
    "( [ vir ] ) , we obtain @xmath45 which is valid for any value @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    ", it gives @xmath48 which is independent of @xmath11 , as expected from chandrasekhar s theory , and needs to be solved for @xmath24 .",
    "however , for @xmath49 , this gives @xmath50 .",
    "conversely , one can write @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .    now in order to obtain the value of @xmath24 and @xmath11 explicitly , we have to evaluate the values of @xmath14 , @xmath44 and @xmath40 .",
    "the magnetostatic balance condition is given by @xmath53 at an arbitrary radius @xmath54 from the center of the star with mass enclosed at that radius @xmath55 , where @xmath36 includes the contribution from @xmath35 as well .",
    "we further assume the variation of @xmath35 to be a power law like such that the corresponding magnetic pressure @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 being constants .",
    "hence , the gravitation energy for this star is @xmath59 assuming that @xmath36 is negligibly small at @xmath60 , surface of the star , compared to that at the center ( or its averaged value ) .",
    "therefore , from eqs .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) and ( [ vir ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 and consequently @xmath62    an important outcome here is that @xmath14 is related to the scaling of @xmath35 with @xmath36 , which is indeed expected from the magnetostatic balance eq .",
    "( [ magst ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the presence of magnetic pressure allows either a massive or / and smaller star .",
    "obviously , for @xmath63 the result reduces to that of the nonmagnetic case with the redefinition @xmath39 .",
    "following refs .  , the upper bound of @xmath35 for a gravitationally bound star corresponds to @xmath64 which leads to maximum allowed @xmath35 @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the radius of sun . for a b - wd having @xmath67 g , and hence averaged @xmath68 g , @xmath69 solar mass and @xmath70 km , with @xmath49 , as reported in refs .",
    ", in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ mas3 ] ) , @xmath58 has to be @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , for the case of @xmath72 solar mass , equatorial @xmath73 km , @xmath74 g , with @xmath75 ( ref . ) , @xmath58 has to be @xmath76 .",
    "importantly , @xmath77 profile and , hence , @xmath46 is determined by @xmath78 profile , which however has not been strictly followed in this approximate calculation .",
    "the present work indicates a possibility of wide application of recently proposed b - wds in modern astrophysics .",
    "the idea that axps / sgrs need sources of energy other than rotational or accretion is certainly inevitable , but the hypothesis that they are highly magnetic nss , although attractive , did not neatly fit in with further observations ( unlike other ideas in astrophysics , like , spinning nss as radio pulsars and accreting compact objects as x - ray binaries , which quickly established themselves as paradigms ) .",
    "hence , it is very important that other possible explanations for the axp / sgr phenomena need to be seriously explored .",
    "the b - wd concept is an extremely attractive alternate for axps / sgrs .",
