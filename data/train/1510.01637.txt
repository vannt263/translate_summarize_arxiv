    "we apply this technique to 2d , but the method can easily be extended to 3d .    by including free surfaces , we see that not only do we introduce localized surface modes ( such as propagating rayleigh waves and non - propagating wag modes ) , but low - frequency bulk modes also become significantly more localized ( sec .",
    "[ sec : vea ] ) .",
    "this effect is not seen with fixed surfaces , which indicates that surface disorder alone does not cause the significant increase in localization . instead",
    ", the increased localization is caused by a combination of surface disorder and boundary conditions , likely related to mode conversion between bulk and rayleigh waves .",
    "this increased localization is coincident with a buildup of energy at free surfaces but not at fixed surfaces ( sec .",
    "[ sec : energy_localization ] ) .",
    "this buildup reduces the energy density in the center of the ribbon .",
    "since the edges are the most disordered part of the system , it stands to reason that the buildup of energy at the edges plays a role in reducing the thermal conductivity .",
    "indeed , we see that increased disorder does reduce the thermal conductivity , and this effect is more pronounced in ribbons with free boundary conditions than with fixed boundary conditions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) , which underscore the importance of rayleigh waves in thermal conductivity lowering .",
    "the results for fixed and free ribbons appear to converge in the limit of large disorder . with enough disorder",
    ", it could be that other effects , such as significant constrictions of the ribbon , become more important than the effects of boundary conditions .",
    "we qualitatively investigate mode conversion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mode_conversion ] ) and find that mode conversion between bulk modes due to surfaces has little effect on thermal conductivity ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) , which can be explained with insights from casimir s model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : casimir ] ) .",
    "in contrast , mode conversion between surface and bulk modes can not be accounted for in casimir s model .    finally , we consider the limitations of common phonon - surface scattering models that do not include rayleigh waves ( sec . [",
    "sec : implications ] ) , such as models that treat phonons as a single scalar wave . while such models can qualitatively produce similar results to models based on elastic waves , a significant gap exists between the scalar wave and elastic wave predictions .",
    "unlike single scalar waves , elastic waves are the long - wave - length limit of real phonons and should result in more accurate predictions .    we have shown that free surfaces ( and the associated rayleigh waves ) play an important role in phonon - surface scattering and phonon localization , yet they are not included in most phonon  surface scattering models",
    ". however , both surface and internal scattering mechanisms ( phonon - phonon , mass - difference , etc . )",
    "play important roles in nanoscale thermal transport .",
    "additional work is needed to develop models that include internal scattering mechanisms , incorporate the effects of free surfaces , and are able to simulate large nanostructures .",
