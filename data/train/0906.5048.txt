    "among the large number of theoretical models proposed to either solve the hierarchy problem and/or explain dark matter with a new stable particle , the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) remains one of the favourite .",
    "supersymmetry not only provides a solution to both these problems but also predicts new physics around the tev scale .",
    "the main drawback of the mssm apart from the lack of evidence for supersymmetric particles is the large number of unknown parameters most of which describe the symmetry breaking sector . with the improved sensitivities of dark matter searches in astroparticle experiments  @xcite ,",
    "the precise determination of the dm relic density from cosmology  @xcite , the latest results from the tevatron  @xcite and the precision measurements , large regions of the parameter space of the supersymmetric models are being probed .",
    "this will continue in the near future with a number of direct and indirect detection experiments improving their sensitivities  @xcite and most importantly with the lhc starting to take data .",
    "the lhc running at the full design energy of 14tev offers good prospects for producing coloured supersymmetric particles lighter than 2 - 3  tev , for discovering one or more higgs scalars  @xcite and for measuring the rare processes in the flavour sector , in particular in b - physics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore some properties of the sparticles , in particular mass differences can be measured precisely in some scenarios  @xcite .    the first studies that extracted constraints on supersymmetric models worked in general within the context of the mssm embedded in a gut scale model such as the cmssm  @xcite . after specifying the fundamental model parameters at the high scale ,",
    "the renormalisation group equations are used to obtain the weak scale particle spectrum .",
    "this approach provides a convenient framework for phenomenological analyses as the number of free parameters is reduced drastically compared to the general mssm ( from o(100 ) to @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters in the case of the cmssm ) .",
    "the drawback is that one is often confined to very specific scenarios , for example in the cmssm the lsp is dominantly bino over most of the parameter space .",
    "this has important consequences for the dark matter relic abundance .",
    "furthermore it was customary to choose some specific values for some of the mssm or even the sm parameters for a convenient representation of the parameter space in two - dimensions .",
    "while the link between specific observables and allowed region of parameter space is easier to grasp in this framework , the allowed parameter space appeared much more restrictive than if all free parameters were allowed to vary .    in the last few years",
    "efficient methods for exploring multi - dimensional parameter space have been used in particle physics and more specifically for determining the allowed parameter space of the cmssm .",
    "this approach showed that the often narrow strips in parameter space obtained when varying only two parameters at a time fattened to large areas  @xcite after letting all parameters of the cmssm and the sm vary in the full range . with this efficient parameter space sampling method",
    "it becomes possible to relax some theoretical assumptions and consider the full parameter space of the mssm . because the number of experimental constraints on tev scale physics is still rather limited it seems a bit premature to go to the full fledge @xmath5 parameters of the mssm or even to the 19 parameters that characterize the model when assuming no flavour structure and equality of all soft parameters for the first and second generations of sfermions ( for an approach along these lines see  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore many parameters , for example those of the first and second generations of squarks , once chosen to be equal to avoid strong flavour - changing neutral current constraints , do not play an important role in the observables selected to fit the model . here we consider a model where input parameters of the mssm are defined at the weak scale and we add some simplifying assumptions : common slepton masses ( @xmath6 ) and common squark masses ( @xmath7 at the weak scale for all three generations and universality of gaugino parameters at the gut scale .",
    "this implies the following relation between the gaugino masses at the weak scale , @xmath8 .",
    "we furthermore assume that @xmath9 is the only non - zero trilinear coupling .",
    "while , as we just argued , the first assumption should not impact much our analysis , the second should certainly be considered as a theoretical bias .",
    "this assumption is however well motivated in the context of models defined at the gut scale .",
    "most importantly in our approach we keep the higgsino parameter @xmath10 and the gaugino mass @xmath11 as completely independent parameter .",
    "the relation between the gaugino and higgsino parameters is what determines the nature of the lsp and plays an important role in determining the lsp - lsp annihilation in the early universe . in that sense our model",
    "has many similarities with the non - universal higgs model which also has @xmath10 and @xmath11 as independent parameters  @xcite .",
    "the observables selected to constrain the model include the relic density of dark matter , @xmath12 , direct searches for higgs and new particles at colliders , searches for rare processes such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment as well as various b - physics observables .",
    "note that the dark matter relic abundance is computed within the standard cosmological scenario .",
    "the direct detection of dark matter while providing stringent constraint on the model introduces additional unknown parameters both from astrophysics and from strong interactions .",
    "we therefore prefer to consider the direct detection rate as an observable to be predicted rather than as a constraint keeping in mind that folding in the astrophysical and hadronic uncertainty could however easily introduce an order of magnitude uncertainty in that prediction  @xcite .",
    "we find that each individual parameter of the mssm model is only weakly constrained , in particular the parameters of the sfermion sector .",
    "the very large allowed parameter space only reflects the still poor sampling of the total parameter space by experiments .",
    "the neutralino sector is better constrained with a preferred value for the lsp of a few hundred gev s and a small likelihood for masses above 900gev , similarly charginos above 1.2tev are disfavoured .",
    "we also find a lower limit on the pseudo - scalar mass as well as on @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore some correlations between parameters of the model are observed , most notably the one between @xmath10 and the gaugino mass .",
    "this is because those two parameters determine the higgsino content of the lsp .",
    "after having determined the allowed parameter space , we examined the predictions for direct detection as well as for lhc searches both in the higgs and susy sector as well as for b - physics observables . although each type of search can only probe a fraction of the total parameter space we find a good complementarity between the different searches with less than 10% of scenarios leading to no signal .",
    "for example large signals for direct detection are expected in the mixed bino / higgsino lsp scenario that are hard to probe at the lhc .",
    "the lhc searches in the susy and higgs sector are also complementary and b - observables are specially useful in scenarios with large @xmath13 and a pseudoscalar that is not too heavy .",
    "the predictions for susy searches can be different from that expected in the constrained cmssm with in particular a large fraction of models that only have a gluino accessible at lhc , the squarks being too heavy . to ascertain how experiments that will take place in the near future",
    "could further constrain the parameter space of the model we consider specific case studies .",
    "for example we consider the impact of a signal in @xmath14 at tevatron or of the observation of a signal in direct detection experiments .",
    "finally we examine in more details the susy signals at the lhc , analysing the preferred decay chains for models that have either a gluino or a squark within the reach of the lhc . in this analysis",
    "we did not include the constraints from indirect detection experiments because the rates predicted feature a strong dependence on additional quantities such as the dark matter profile or the boost factor .",
    "the predictions for the rates for @xmath15 will be presented in a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the model and the impact of various constraints are described in section 2 .",
    "the method used for the fit is described in section 3 .",
    "the results of the global fits are presented in section 4 together with the impact of a selected number of future measurements .",
    "the susy signatures are detailed in section 5 .",
    "the conclusion contains a summary of our results .",
    "we consider the mssm with input parameters defined at the weak scale .",
    "we assume minimal flavour violation , equality of the soft masses between sfermion generations and unification of the gaugino mass at the gut scale .",
    "the latter leads to @xmath8 at the weak scale ( relaxing this assumption is kept for a further study ) .",
    "we allow for only one non - zero trilinear coupling @xmath9 . for",
    "the b - squark the mixing which is @xmath16 is driven in general by @xmath17 rather than by the trilinear coupling , this approximation is however not very good in the small sample of models with @xmath18  gev .",
    "note also that the higgs mass at high @xmath13 can show some dependence on the sbottom mixing . for first and second generations of squarks",
    "the mixing which depends on fermions masses is negligible except for the neutralino - nucleon cross section since the dominant contributions to the scalar cross section are also dependent on fermion masses .",
    "however since the squark exchange diagram is usually subdominant as compared to higgs exchange , the neglected contribution of the trilinear coupling falls within the theoretical uncertainties introduced by the hadronic matrix elements  @xcite . similarly neglecting the the muon trilinear mixing , @xmath19 ,",
    "could affect the prediction for @xmath20 but this effect is not large compared with the uncertainties on the value extracted from measurements .",
    "the top quark mass @xmath21 is also used as an input although it has a much weaker influence on the results than in the case of gut scale models . for the latter",
    "the top quark mass enters the renormalization group evolution and can have a large impact on the supersymmetric spectrum in some regions of the parameter space . in the general mssm",
    "the top quark mass mainly influences the light higgs mass .",
    "we fix @xmath22 and @xmath23  gev .",
    "the free parameters of our mssm model with unified gaugino masses , mssm - ug , are @xmath24 the range examined for each of these parameters is listed in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "mssm - ug has a far more restricted set of paramters than the general mssm , still this model will show how the possibilities for susy scenarios open up .",
    "the observables that will be used in the fit are listed in table  [ tab : constraints ] .",
    "we first review the expectations for the role of each observable in constraining the mssm parameter space .",
    ".[tab : param ] range of the free mssm - ug parameters . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : squark ]    the left - handed quark which couples strongly to the wino and/or higgsino component has a wide variety of decay modes .",
    "the frequency of each dominant decay chain are displayed in table  [ tab : squark ] for each lsp configuration .",
    "for the bino lsp the dominant mode is usually @xmath25 with typical branching fractions around 60% .",
    "the chargino will decay either into @xmath26 or @xmath27 when light sleptons are present .",
    "the subdominant mode in those scenario is @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the decay chains are similar to those of the cmssm . in some cases",
    "the second chargino , a mixed higgsino / wino , is kinematically accessible and the dominant mode will be @xmath30 with subdominant decays into @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 will decay preferentially into @xmath34 or in other neutralinos as well as into @xmath35 .",
    "the higgs can be produced in either @xmath36 or further in @xmath37 .",
    "a fraction of models ( 7.7% ) feature the dominant decay into the lsp @xmath38 .",
    "because the squark @xmath39 has a suppressed rate to the bino , this channel is dominant only when other two - body channels are kinematically forbidden .    for a mixed lsp ( @xmath40 ) the relative importance of the various decay channels shifts .",
    "the decay @xmath38 is dominant in less than 3% of the cases although because of the higgsino component of the lsp this can occur even when heavier neutralinos are kinematically accesssible . by far",
    "the most frequent dominant decay is @xmath30 with significant branching fractions in @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "the heavier chargino always has two - body decay modes , @xmath43 ( preferably @xmath34 ) or @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 in turn feature mostly 3-body decays .",
    "note that decay modes into higgs bosons @xmath36 can involve even the heavy higgs bosons . as usual",
    "when light sleptons are present the decay @xmath46 can be dominant .",
    "for the higgsino lsp ( @xmath47 ) , the dominant mode is either @xmath48 or @xmath49 with some contributions from @xmath49 and @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath33 channel has similar decay chains as the mixed lsp except that the dominant mode is usually @xmath50 rather than channels involving higgses .",
    "the @xmath51 can in a few cases decay via two - body , @xmath52 or @xmath35 , but in most cases it decays via three - body dominantly into @xmath53 .",
    "these decays mainly give signatures into jets and missing energy .",
    "the @xmath45 produced in squark or neutralino decays will also decay via three body final states .    in summary",
    "@xmath39 decays dominantly into heavy charginos with further decay chains involving other chargino / neutralino states .",
    "decay chains involving slepton production dominater only in 25% of scenarios . finally recall that the elastic scattering cross section also differs significantly depending on the nature of the lsp giving an opportunity to correlate susy signals at lhc with those of direct detection . for the bino lsp , @xmath54",
    "pb while @xmath55  pb for the mixed ( higgsino ) lsp .",
    "we do not discuss in detail the case where both squarks and gluinos are below 2tev .",
    "the decay chains can be rather complicated with the possibility of producing the gluino in squark decay and vice - versa .",
    "the case where the gluino is heavier than the squarks features the same decay chains for the squarks as the case just discussed .",
    "increasing the number of free parameters as compared to the cmssm model has opened up the possibilities for supersymmetric scenarios that are compatible with all experimental constraints and this even maintaining the universality of gaugino mass .",
    "although the parameter space of the model is still not very well constrained , we found that the most favoured models have a lsp of a few hundred gev with a significant higgsino fraction ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "contrary to the cmssm case the higgsino lsp is not fully correlated with a very heavy squark sector although all our scenarios favour squarks above the tev scale .",
    "a very light pseudoscalar is also disfavoured with @xmath57  gev , this means that large deviations from the sm in b - physics observables are expected only in a small fraction of allowed scenarios .",
    "our favoured scenarios predict few signals at the tevatron , the pseudoscalar higgs as well as the coloured sector are too heavy to be accessed by direct searches .",
    "only very few scenarios have a potentially large enough rate for trilepton searches at the tevatron .",
    "the complementarity between future experiments to probe this class of models was emphasized . even though susy or heavy higgs signals are not guaranteed at lhc , the majority of allowed models predict at least one signal either at the lhc ( including the flavour sector ) or in future direct detection experiment .",
    "furthermore the light higgs is expected to be around 120gev with sm - like couplings .",
    "we have also explored the various dominant decay chains for gluinos and squarks that could be produced at lhc in the mssm - ug as well as for the heavy neutralinos appearing in the decays of these coloured sparticles .",
    "we found that for models with gluinos accessible at lhc , a significant fraction of the heavy neutralinos produced decayed dominantly into a gauge or higgs boson .",
    "furthermore states which decayed into sleptons are rarely dominant .",
    "we also showed how the preferred squarks decay channels are determined to a large extent by the neutralino composition . whether one can exploit these decay chains to determine some properties of the sparticles remains to be seen . in our analysis the relic density measurement plays the dominant role in constraining the model , since the relic density computation implicitly assumes a standard cosmological scenario , relaxing this requirement affects significantly the allowed parameter space of the model .",
    "finally we comment on the difference between our results and other recent analyses done within the framework of the mssm with 24 parameters , either using a mcmc likelihood approach or applying @xmath58 constraints on each of the observables  @xcite .",
    "first these studies were done in a more general model than the one we have considered , with in particular no universality condition on the gaugino masses .",
    "this means that the lsp can have a significant wino component and therefore is more likely to be at the tev scale as was found in  @xcite using linear priors .",
    "recall that a tev scale wino annihilates efficiently into gauge bosons pairs .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite also emphasizes the prior dependence with a generally much lighter spectrum using log priors . this is due mostly to the poorly constrained parameter space  @xcite . as in our analysis squarks and sleptons ran over the full range allowed in the scan and the pseudoscalar mass can be very heavy .    the analysis of  @xcite used a different statistical treatment but most importantly did not require that the neutalino explained all the dm in the universe ( only an upper bound on @xmath12 was imposed ) .",
    "this means that a large number of models with small mass splitting between the lsp and the nlsp appeared in the scan calling for a careful study of collider limits . in our approach",
    "such models are ruled out since they have @xmath59 .",
    "this analysis further emphasized the light susy spectrum in their scans so naturally found preferred lsp mass below the tev scale .",
