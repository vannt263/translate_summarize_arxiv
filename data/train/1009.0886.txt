    "notice that no words in @xmath48 contain @xmath191 or @xmath192 , and furthermore only words in @xmath48 contain @xmath92 or @xmath193 .",
    "suppose a long braid move @xmath93 affects the triple @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",
    "before we apply this move , a quadruple @xmath56 is an @xmath48-subnetwork if and only if @xmath196 is to the right of @xmath180 . after this move",
    ", a quadruple @xmath56 is an @xmath48-subnetwork if and only if @xmath196 is to the left of @xmath180 .",
    "thus the net change in the number of @xmath48-subnetworks is @xmath197 , which is exactly what the formula would give .",
    "in fact , all four elements of @xmath48 occur with equal probability over all reduced decompositions of @xmath198 .",
    "we conclude our discussion with a generalization of this interesting phenomenon .",
    "let @xmath1 .",
    "the _ complement _ of a reduced decomposition @xmath199 of @xmath3 is @xmath200 .",
    "the _ reverse _ of @xmath199 is @xmath201 .",
    "note that the complement and the reverse may not exist for an arbitrary reduced decomposition .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath202 , and let @xmath139 and @xmath203 be two reduced decompositions of @xmath40 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath139 and @xmath203 are reverses , then the total number of @xmath139-subnetworks is equal to the total number of @xmath203-subnetworks over all reduced decompositions of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is the longest word of @xmath204 , and @xmath40 is the longest word of @xmath49 , then @xmath139 must have a complement @xmath203 .",
    "furthermore , the total number of @xmath139-subnetworks is equal to the total number of @xmath203-subnetworks over all reduced decompositions of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath50 denote a reduced decomposition of @xmath3 .",
    "then we claim that there exists an @xmath168 such that an @xmath139-subnetwork of @xmath50 can be mapped bijectively to an @xmath203-subnetwork of @xmath168 . since we consider all reduced decompositions of @xmath3 , the total number of @xmath139-subnetworks is equal to the total number of @xmath203-subnetworks",
    ".    1 .   given any reduced decomposition @xmath50 of @xmath3 , let @xmath168 denote the reverse of @xmath50 . then for any pair of transpositions @xmath205 and @xmath206 , we have @xmath205 occurs before @xmath206 in @xmath50 implies that @xmath205 occurs after @xmath206 in @xmath168 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , every @xmath139-subnetwork of @xmath50 is mapped to an @xmath203-subnetwork of @xmath168 .",
    "if @xmath40 is the longest word of @xmath49 , then the complement of @xmath139 is obtained by applying reiner s cyclic shifting trick ( see @xmath207 ) @xmath51 times .",
    "thus every reduced decomposition of the longest word has a complement .",
    "given a reduced reduced decomposition @xmath50 of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath168 denote the complement of @xmath50 .",
    "suppose @xmath208 is an @xmath139-subnetwork , then @xmath209 is an @xmath203-subnetwork .",
    "in this paper , we studied three aspects of commutation classes : the size of @xmath0 , the structure of @xmath0 , and the enumeration of subnetworks . our concluding remarks are also divided into three sections .",
    "we first examine our bound in theorem [ bounding ] for four types of permutations :    * _ 321 avoiding _ : the lower bound yields 1 , which is exactly the number of vertices of @xmath25 . * _ y=1 _ : in this case , @xmath0 is a path . by corollary @xmath210",
    ", there are @xmath91 vertices , which favors the lower bound . * _ @xmath211 _ : the exact number is not known , but knuth showed in @xmath74 that @xmath212 .",
    "since @xmath213 , both bounds are decent . * _ freely braided _ : by corollary @xmath214 , @xmath215 , which usually favors the lower bound unless @xmath57 is close to @xmath73 .",
    "we note here that green and losonczy @xcite proved that the @xmath216 .",
    "since the number of 321-patterns increases dramatically as the number of inversions increases , this bound is more accurate for permutations with a small number of inversions , while the upper bound in theorem [ bounding ] is more accurate for permutation with a large number of inversions .",
    "for example , the permutation @xmath198 has @xmath217 patterns of 321 , but it only has @xmath218 inversions .",
    "can we refine the upper bound by combining these two bounds ? counting the number of elnitsky polygons might be a useful tool .    in the proof of theorem [ boundsum ]",
    ", we bounded the number of commutation classes by the catalan number .",
    "the representative elements are in some sense variations of the bidirectional ballot sequence studied by zhao @xcite .",
    "can we refine the bound in theorem [ boundsum ] by studying such sequences ?",
    "does the combination of theorem [ bounding ] and theorem [ boundsum ] yield tighter bounds ?",
    "our method in the proof of the upper bound of theorem [ boundsum ] is inspired by the author s recent work @xcite on the higher bruhat order .",
    "the higher bruhat order is a generalization of the symmetric group .",
    "is there an analogue of the higher bruhat order for coxeter groups of type b ?",
    "such a generalization might help us to refine the bound for type b in section [ upperbound ] .",
    "in a recent paper ( @xcite theorem 4.2 ) , the author showed that @xmath0 is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of @xmath219 for all @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that analyzing the structure of special @xmath3 is crucial for understanding the overall structure of @xmath219 .",
    "ziegler ( @xcite theorem 5.2 ) combined with felsner and weil ( @xcite theorem 1 ) showed that @xmath219 is homotopy equivalent to an @xmath220-sphere .",
    "what is the topological structure of @xmath0 for arbitrary @xmath3 ?    in section 4 , we studied the cycle structure of @xmath0 using pattern avoidance .",
    "however , we are unable to describe @xmath0 if @xmath3 contains multiple 4321-patterns .",
    "one possible approach to this complicated problem is to start with the case when the 4321-pattern do not intersect with each other .",
    "does @xmath0 have a nice geometric structure if @xmath3 contains no intersecting 4321-patterns ?",
    "now let s talk about involutions .",
    "following the work of richardson and springer @xcite , there has been a surge of interest in the strong bruhat order on the involutions ( e.g. @xcite . )",
    "however , the weak bruhat order on involutions has never been studied before .",
    "this is because the poset induced by the weak bruhat order on involutions is not a graded poset , and reduced decomposition can not be defined for a non - graded poset .",
    "nevertheless , incitti s pictorial classification of cover relations in the strong bruhat order on involutions in @xcite can be easily translated to the weak bruhat order .",
    "can we find an analogue of @xmath0 for involutions that avoid certain patterns ?",
    "the subnetwork is a useful tool to study commutation classes . in section [ poset ]",
    ", we constructed commutation classes using 212-subnetworks .",
    "the proof of theorem [ recperm ] essentially used the fact that a subnetwork appears as a substring only if the permutation is vexillary by tenner s result in @xcite .",
    "since a subnetwork records the relative positions of a subset of @xmath52 , it can be thought of as a permutation pattern for reduced decompositions .",
    "therefore it is natural for us to study enumerations of subnetworks .    unlike permutation patterns , however , the study of subnetworks is a relatively new subject .",
    "the concept of subnetworks was first introduced by warrington @xcite in november 2009 ( when his preprint first appeared on the arxiv ) . since then , angel and holroyd @xcite studied the enumeration of subnetworks for the first time .",
    "this subject is still wide open .",
    "one interesting topic is subnetwork - avoidance .",
    "we say that a reduced decomposition is _ @xmath48-avoiding _ if it does not induce any @xmath48-subnetworks . in proposition",
    "[ subenum ] , we found the exact number of @xmath48-subnetworks induced by the reduced decomposition of the long word @xmath198 for @xmath187 , but our result does not immediately give the number of reduced decompositions that avoids @xmath48 .",
    "warrington @xcite has generated the following data for the number of @xmath48-avoiding reduced decompositions starting from @xmath221 :    @xmath222    [ [ question ] ] question + + + + + + + +    let @xmath187 , and @xmath14 .",
    "how many reduced decompositions of @xmath198 are @xmath48-avoiding ? how many commutation classes are @xmath48-avoiding ?",
    "particular thanks are due to richard stanley for his suggestion to study reduced decompositions and for his continued guidance .",
