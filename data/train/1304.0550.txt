    "based on the gravitational action and nonlinear electrodynamics originally proposed by eddington @xcite , and born and infeld @xcite , respectively , baados and ferreira recently established a new eddington - inspired born - infeld ( eibi ) theory of gravity @xcite , which reduces to general relativity ( gr ) in vacuum ( see , e.g. , @xcite for relevant studies ) .",
    "however , in the presence of coupling between matter , eibi theory demonstrates several distinctive features , including the avoidance of singularities in the early cosmology and in the newtonian collapse of pressureless particles , the formation of stable pressureless stars , and the existence of pressureless cold dark matter with a nonzero jeans length @xcite .",
    "all such features stem from the effective repulsive gravitational effect intrinsic to eibi theory with a positive coupling constant @xmath4 ( see the following discussion for the definition of @xmath4 ) .",
    "hence , in comparison with gr , eibi theory also allows compact stars to attain higher mass limits @xcite .    unlike gr , in eibi theory gravity and matter are nonlinearly coupled together .",
    "therefore , the distinctions between gr and eibi theory are expected to emerge in the high - density regime . to this end , the static structure and the stability of compact stars in eibi theory",
    "have become the focus of several recent papers @xcite .",
    "as noted in these papers , the presence of terms proportional to the spatial derivatives of the density in the equations governing the hydrostatic equilibrium and radial oscillation of compact stars in eibi theory could potentially hamper the related studies if nonanalytic ( i.e. , discontinuous or nondifferentiable ) equations of state ( eoss ) are considered . to bypass the problems arising from such derivatives , in the above - mentioned studies the eoss employed in constructing compact stars in eibi theory are either polytropic or analytic fits mimicking the behavior of realistic nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "however , even for polytropic eoss of the form @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 being the pressure , rest - mass density , and a fixed constant , respectively , pani and sotiriou have recently discovered that the ricci scalar diverges at the stellar surface if the constant @xmath8 is greater than 3/2 @xcite .",
    "such singular behavior is attributable to the auxiliary field @xmath9 proposed in eibi gravity . in the process of eliminating the auxiliary field in the equation of motion , higher derivatives of the matter field emerge and hence lead to a sensitive dependence on the matter distribution .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate how the static structure of compact stars in eibi theory could be affected by drastic changes in the eos .",
    "specifically , we consider nuclear eoss with first - order ( second - order ) phase transitions , where the energy density ( the sound speed ) is a discontinuous function of pressure . even in gr ,",
    "the effects of such discontinuities are known to be nontrivial @xcite , and could lead to a third family of compact stars @xcite . for compact stars in eibi gravity , we find that in the presence of first - order phase transitions , no equilibrium configuration exists if the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the ricci scalar develops a @xmath2-function singularity and discontinuity at the radius where the speed of sound is discontinuous due to phase transitions .",
    "we note that such behavior is in stark contrast to the case in gr .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly summarize eibi gravity and the equilibrium configuration of compact stars in secs .  [",
    "s2 ] and [ s3 ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we consider equilibrium stars in eibi gravity constructed with eoss with first - order phase transitions and investigate the effects and physical implications of such transitions .",
    "the singular behavior revealed in the ricci scalar as a consequence of the discontinuity in the sound speed is studied in sec .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "we use units where @xmath11 unless otherwise noted .",
    "based on the eddington gravity action and the born - infeld nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite , baados and ferreira established the eibi gravity @xcite , which is summarized here as follows .",
    "the starting point of the eibi theory is the action @xmath12 given by @xmath13 .",
    "\\label{eq : eibi_action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the symmetric part of the ricci tensor and is constructed solely from the connection @xmath15 .",
    "however , the matter action @xmath16 depends only on the metric @xmath17 and the matter field @xmath18 . besides",
    ", the determinant of a tensor @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath20 , and the convention @xmath21 is used hereafter .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath22 are related to the cosmological constant by @xmath23 such that , in the limit @xmath24 , the action ( [ eq : eibi_action ] ) reduces to the einstein - hilbert action . in the present paper we aim at asymptotic flat solutions and",
    "hence consider the case with @xmath25 .",
    "several constraints on the value and the sign of the remaining parameter @xmath4 have been obtained from solar observations , big bang nucleosynthesis , and the existence of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in particular , for cases with positive @xmath4 , effective gravitational repulsion prevails , leading to the existence of pressureless stars and increases in the mass limits of compact stars @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the spacetime metric @xmath17 and the connection @xmath26 are treated as independent fields in eibi theory .",
    "the field equations are derived by minimizing the action ( [ eq : eibi_action ] ) with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath15 separately , and read as @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 being an auxiliary metric related to the connection , @xmath29 on the other hand , the stress - energy tensor @xmath30 still satisfies the standard conservation equations , @xmath31 where , as in gr , the covariant derivative refers to the metric @xmath17 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that both @xmath14 and @xmath32 can lead to a difference in the two metrics @xmath17 and @xmath28 .",
    "if somehow there are some discontinuities in @xmath32 ( or its derivatives ) , then the field equation ( [ eq : field2 ] ) implies that @xmath17 and/or @xmath28 will accordingly acquire the corresponding property .",
    "however , as @xmath14 is constructed from the connection @xmath15 given by ( [ connection ] ) , it contains the second - order derivatives of @xmath28 .",
    "so it is difficult , if not impossible , to maintain the balance of the field equation ( [ eq : field1 ] ) at these discontinuities if the second - order derivatives of @xmath28 do not exist .",
    "thus , we expect that the discontinuities in @xmath32 ( or its derivatives ) will give rise to similar discontinuities in @xmath17 , but not in @xmath28 . on the other hand , in gr the density profile of compact stars ( or its spatial derivatives )",
    "is in general discontinuous due to the presence of phase transitions .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion we consider compact stars in eibi gravity and study specifically how phase transitions could affect the equilibrium configuration and the ricci scalars derived respectively from @xmath17 and @xmath28 .",

    "we briefly review and follow the approach developed in ref .",

    "it follows directly from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) and ( [ eq : e_lambda ] ) that @xmath53 , and @xmath54 increases monotonically with @xmath44 . besides",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath55 for positive @xmath0 and @xmath56+{\\cal o}(\\kappa^2)\\ } + { 2m}/{r^2}$ ] . as the typical value of @xmath57 at the center of a compact star is less than 0.4 @xcite , for specificity we assume in the present paper @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , we have numerically verified that @xmath55 except for @xmath58 .",
    "the boundary conditions supplementing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : m ] ) are as follows .",
    "first of all , the radius of the star @xmath59 is as usual defined by the condition @xmath60 .",
    "outside the star where @xmath61 , eibi gravity is equivalent to gr , and @xmath17 is identical to the schwarzschild metric ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions at the stellar surface @xmath62 are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the mass of the star .",
    "the equilibrium configuration of compact stars has been studied in refs .",
    "however , the compact stars considered in these references are all characterized by the smooth eoss @xmath52 where @xmath67 can be unambiguously defined , and is continuous and nonvanishing except at the stellar surface . unlike the tov equations in gr , the hydrostatic equilibrium equations ( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : m ] ) demonstrate an explicit dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the behavior of @xmath3 could strongly affect the equilibrium configuration of a compact star . in the following we consider two different cases , namely , ( i ) @xmath68 ( as in first - order phase transitions ) and ( ii ) @xmath3 is discontinuous ( as in both first- and second - order phase transitions ) .",
    "for an eos with a first - order phase transition ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , there is an interval in which the energy density increases while the pressure remains the same , and consequently @xmath68 . to examine the consequence and other related problems of such first - order phase transitions for compact stars in eibi gravity , we first consider cases with @xmath69 and expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) up to order @xmath3 , @xmath70^{-1 } .",
    "\\label{1 - 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be noted that @xmath71 is still nonvanishing as @xmath72 .",
    "we study the implications for the cases @xmath73 and @xmath74 separately .",
    "first of all , for @xmath75 , we can still get a normal energy density profile in the region with @xmath69 , where @xmath76 is approximately equal to a negative constant and @xmath77 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ positive - first ] , where a first - order phase transition really takes place at a certain pressure ( the eos is adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there is a finite region with constant @xmath76 . therefore the energy density is now a continuous function .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a `` mixed phase '' region ( e.g. , quark - nucleon mixed phase @xcite ) with constant pressure .",
    "the thickness of this region is proportional to @xmath4 , and hence vanishes in gr , resulting in a discontinuity in the density profile ( see fig .",
    "[ positive - first ] ) .",
    "the existence of a constant pressure shell in compact stars built upon eibi gravity is attributable to the effective repulsive gravity inherent in eibi gravity with positive @xmath4 .",
    "actually , the effective repulsion also leads to the formation of pressureless stars , as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .     and",
    "@xmath35 are in cgs units ) is studied in both gr ( i.e. @xmath78 ) and eibi gravity ( @xmath79 , with @xmath80 ) .",
    "the central density is also fixed at @xmath81 ]    on the other hand , if @xmath10 while @xmath69 , both @xmath82 and @xmath76 will become _ positive _ , and in the limit of @xmath72 , @xmath83 and @xmath76 tends to a nonvanishing _ positive _ number .",
    "such behavior is in stark contrast to the case of gr where both @xmath82 and @xmath76 are negative definite . if one starts with a certain energy density at the center of a star and integrates eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : m ] ) outward , one will find that the energy density drops initially and then rises again in the density region where a first - order phase transition occurs and @xmath84 . as a result",
    ", the energy density can not drop to zero and the surface of the star is undefined , implying that equilibrium compact stars characterized by eoss with first - order phase transitions do not exist if @xmath10 .    as a matter of fact , for stars with a sufficiently soft phase where @xmath3 is small , we note a similar problem for eibi gravity with @xmath10 .",
    "we focus on the last term of the modified tov equation ( [ eq : p ] ) , @xmath85^{-1 } .\\ ] ] given an equation of state , this term depends solely on the energy density . when @xmath86 , i.e. , in the case of gr , it is always negative .",
    "however , when @xmath10 and @xmath3 is small , this term may blow up at certain values of energy density regions , and consequently the modified tov equation can not be solved .",
    "this again implies that for @xmath10 , compact stars with soft eoss may not be able to support an equilibrium state .",
    "the predicament encountered in solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) in the presence of first - order phase transitions can also be understood in terms of the concept of the apparent eos proposed by delsate and steinhoff @xcite , who have shown that eibi gravity can be recast as ordinary gr provided that the physical eos is replaced with an apparent eos @xmath87 , where for perfect fluids the apparent pressure @xmath88 and density @xmath89 are given respectively by @xmath90 , @xmath91 , with @xmath92^{-1/2}$ ] and @xmath93/\\kappa$ ] . in first - order phase transitions , where @xmath94 , @xmath95 therefore , for negative @xmath4 , @xmath96 . in this case , despite the fact that the tov equations in gr guarantee that @xmath88 decreases monotonically towards the stellar surface , the apparent density @xmath89 increases instead in the region where a first - order phase transition takes place .",
    "hence , by the same token , it is also impossible to construct the equilibrium configuration of a compact star governed by the tov equations and the apparent eos .",
    "in the above discussion , we see that the equilibrium configuration of compact stars can generally be constructed in eibi gravity with positive @xmath4 even in the presence of phase transitions . in particular , the energy density @xmath35 is always a continuous function of the radial coordinate @xmath44 .",
    "however , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be shown in the present paper , the associated ricci scalar still acquires certain singular behaviors ( e.g. , discontinuities and divergence ) due to higher derivatives of @xmath35 .    in eibi gravity",

    ", @xmath3 is in general discontinuous at the transition point ( see , e.g. , the inset in fig .  1 ) .",
    "hence , it is likely that these ricci scalars could become discontinuous or even blow up at radius @xmath101 where the phase transition occurs .",
    "however , it is readily shown that @xmath39 , @xmath102 , @xmath40 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are indeed continuous functions of @xmath44 even in the presence of phase transitions .",
    "hence , @xmath98 is still well - behaved even in the vicinity of @xmath105 , which agrees with our intuition as mentioned in sec .  [ s2 ] .",
    "besides , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and discussed in the last section , @xmath98 is indeed the standard ricci scalar in gr for a star constructed with the apparent eos .",
    "therefore , its regularity is also expected .",
    "the situation is completely different for @xmath99 .",

    "thus , for compact stars where first- or second - order phase transitions take place , the ricci scalar @xmath99 is singular in the sense that it contains a @xmath2-function - type divergence and spatial discontinuity . as is well known , the ricci scalar in gr is proportional @xmath117 and is always bounded .",
    "the @xmath2-function - type divergence in @xmath99 discovered here is a distinctive feature of eibi gravity .",

    "for eoss with phase transitions , either of first- or second - order ( the eoss are adapted from refs .",

    "the discontinuity in @xmath99 obtained numerically in fact agrees with the expression given by eq .",
