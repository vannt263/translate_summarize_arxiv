    "the two peaks with a shallow valley constitute a trapezoid - like profile above 35 kev separated by a wide trough .",

    "the profiles obtained from suzaku observation , however , appear to be different from that of the rxte and integral observations .",

    "is found to be similar to that obtained from the @xmath52 observation of the 1989 outburst ( mihara 1995 ) .",
    "the dip - like structure , prominent only at soft x - rays is also recognized in the @xmath52 profile . because the @xmath52 observation was made during the outburst when the source was @xmath180 times brighter than the present observation",

    "the dip - like structure could have been missed in the pulse profiles .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of a0535 + 262 has been described by different continuum models at different energy ranges .",
    "hard x - ray observations during outbursts , meant for the study of cyclotron absorption features and hence the pulsar magnetic field , were fitted by different continuum models such as optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung , power - law , power - law with an exponential cut - off , wien s law or different combinations of above components ( dal fiume et al.1988 ; kendziorra et al .",
    "1994 ; grove et al .",
    "1995 ) , whereas the 237 kev spectrum , obtained from the @xmath52 observation of the 1989 outburst , was well fitted with npex continuum model ( mihara 1995 ) .",
    "current analysis of the @xmath0 data showed that the npex continuum model fits well to the source spectrum .",
    "selection of an appropriate continuum model may be crucial to investigate the broad features in the spectrum , such as the soft excess represented by a blackbody component .",
    "the spectral fitting to the 0.310  kev bepposax spectra , during quiescence , yielded a blackbody component of temperature @xmath11.3  kev along with a power - law component of index @xmath11.8 ( mukherjee & paul 2005 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the suzaku data when fitted with npex continuum model yielded a much lower temperature of @xmath10.16 kev , which is common for most of the x - ray pulsars .",
    "we suspect that the difference arises from the different selection of the continuum model .",
    "in fact , when the suzaku wide band spectra were fitted by a power - law with an exponential cutoff , we did indeed obtain a blackbody temperature of 1.36 kev .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of the continuum selection to quantify the blackbody component .",
    "however , the selection criteria for the continuum choice have yet to be rigorously defined .",
    "most of the transient be / x - ray binary pulsars undergo periodic outbursts due to the enhanced mass accretion when the neutron star passes through the dense regions of the circumstellar disk . during the passage , there is every possibility of the increase in the absorption column density . in case of a0535 + 262",
    ", we found that the absorption column density was higher than the galactic column density towards a0535 + 262 ( 5.9 @xmath7 10@xmath40 atoms @xmath33 ) during the minor outburst in 2005 august - september .",
    "note that the @xmath0 observation was made near the apastron at the orbital phase of 0.420.43 . from bepposax observations of the pulsar in quiescence ( orbital phases 0.77 , 0.05 , 0.42 ) , though",
    ", the estimated value of the absorption column density was found to be similar to that of the galactic column density ( mukherjee & paul 2005 ) . during the 1998 rxte / pca observations ( in quiescence , orbital phases of 0.0 and 0.77 ) ,",
    "the value of the absorption column density was found to be a factor of about 10 higher than that of the galactic column density ( negueruela et al .",
    "2000 ) . during the @xmath52 observation of the pulsar in the 1989 outburst ( orbital phase of 0.96 ) ,",
    "the estimated absorption column density was found to be 4.8@xmath53 @xmath7 10@xmath40 atoms @xmath33 ( mihara 1995 ) , which is compatible with the galactic value .",
    "these are only three instances where the absorption column density of the pulsar is reported so far .",
    "although the available data are scarce , the absorption column density does not show clear correlation with the source intensity or the orbital phase . in this sense , it is note worthy that the observations of the large absorption column with rxte / pca were made when the circumstellar disk around the be companion ( be disk ) was absent ( negueruela et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "haigh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the x - ray activity of the pulsar is correlated with the change of the truncation radius of the be disk .",
    "the truncation of the disk by the tidal interaction with the neutron star , which defines the truncation radius , could explain the observed x - ray outbursts in be / x - ray binary systems .",
    "when the truncation radius reduces , the material from the outer portions of the disk are expelled and may be found elsewhere in the binary system .",
    "this may trigger the giant x - ray outburst .",
    "when the be disk disappears , as the case of rxte / pca observations , all the disk material is considered to be accreted and/or ejected throughout the binary system .",
    "the presence of the expelled material in the line of sight may have caused a moderately large absorption column .",
    "haigh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argues that the reduction of the be disk continues for several orbital periods before / after the giant outburst .",
    "because the suzaku observation was made about an orbital period after the giant outburst in may / june 2005 , the reduced be disk may have caused moderately large absorption column .",
    "broad - band spectroscopy of a0535 + 262 shows the presence of a weak iron k@xmath3 emission line with @xmath125  ev equivalent width .",
    "other than the 1989 @xmath52 observation and recent rxte and integral observations of the same minor outburst , none of the previous observations of the pulsar could detect the weak emission line at @xmath16.4  kev .",
    "the emission line is interpreted as due to the fluorescent line from the cold ambient matter in the vicinity of the neutron star .",
    "if the cold matter is distributed spherically symmetric around the neutron star , the excess column density over the galactic value , @xmath54 atoms @xmath33 , would produce an iron emission line with an equivalent width of only a few ev ( makishima 1986 ) .",
    "the larger equivalent width we detected may be interpreted as the cold matter having an asymmetric distribution , and more matter is distributed outside the line of sight .",
    "the fluorescence of the atmosphere of the binary companion could be a possible source of the iron emission line .",
    "however , we consider that it does not have a major contribution to the observed equivalent width , because the solid angle subtended by the companion , which is estimated as @xmath55 @xmath56 10@xmath57 at apastron , is very small due to the long - orbital period of a0535 + 262 .",
    "instead , we conjecture that the accretion disk is the probable reprocessing site to produce the iron fluorescent line .",
    "because the pulse phase with higher line flux covers more than a half of the pulse period , the reprocessing site should subtend a large solid angle against the neutron star .",
    "the accretion disk conforms to this condition .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of a0535 + 262 showed that the blackbody component , used to describe the soft excess , is pulsating as seen in some other accreting x - ray pulsars , such as lmc  x-4 , smc  x-1 etc .",
    "( naik & paul 2004a , naik & paul 2004b , paul et al .  2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the pulsation is found to be in phase with that of the middle - band x - ray emission ( eg .",
    "2.55.0 kev band ; see figure  3 ) .",
    "however , in case of her  x-1 , the pulsating soft component is found to be shifted by about 230@xmath15 in phase from the power - law continuum component ( endo et al .",
    "2000 ) . a systematic and detailed study of the accreting x - ray pulsars which show soft excess revealed that the soft excess is a common feature in the x - ray pulsars ( hickox et al . 2004 ) .",
    "both the pulsating and non - pulsating natures of the soft excess seen in various x - ray pulsars suggest a different origin of emission of the soft components .",
    "the possible origins of the soft excess in accretion powered x - ray pulsars are ( a ) emission from accretion column , ( b ) emission by a collisionally energized cloud , ( c ) reprocessing by a diffuse cloud , and ( d ) reprocessing by optically thick material in the accretion disk ( hickox et al . 2004 ) . the soft excess emission from the accretion column and by the reprocessing of harder x - rays by optically thick material in the accretion disk , are expected to show pulsations whereas in other cases , it is non - pulsating in nature .",
    "the pulsation of the soft component ( blackbody component ) in phase with the middle - band x - ray emission in a0535 + 262 suggests that the most probable region of soft x - ray emission is the accretion column and/or the inner accretion disk .",
    "the absorption column seems to have significant contribution to produce the dip like structure at soft x - rays at phases 0.65 - 0.80 in the count rate profile ( left top panel of figure  [ phrs ] ) .",
    "column density takes large values , @xmath58 atoms @xmath33 , at phase 0.7 - 0.8 .",
    "this may contribute to produce the dip like structure in the profiles below 1 kev which disappears from the profiles at higher energies .",
    "on the other hand , the primary dip exists at all the energies .",
    "the observed primary dip in the pulse profile can be understood by the change in the npex model parameters over pulse phase .",
    "the npex continuum model is an approximation of the unsaturated thermal comptonization in hot plasma ( makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) . at low energies",
    ", it reduces to the ordinary power - law with negative slope .",
    "the lower value of the power - law index ( @xmath26 ) at the primary dip phase implies large optical depth to the compton scattering .",
    "this means that many photons are scattered - out from the line of sight .",
    "it explains the presence of the primary dip in the soft and hard x - ray pulse profiles at same phase .",
    "in addition to the primary dip , the deepening of the dip at the phases 0.0 - 0.17 ( figure  [ erpp ] ) can also be understood by the changes of the parameters of the comptonizing plasma .",
    "the power - law index ( @xmath26 ) tends to be larger and the exponential cut - off energy is smaller in this phase range .",
    "this means that the comptonizing plasma has a relatively smaller optical depth and a lower temperature .",
    "this reduces the efficiency of compton up - scattering and the number of hard photons , which causes the deepening of the dip at phases 0.0 - 0.17 above 5 kev .",
    "using the suzaku observation of a0535 + 262 , we performed the timing and spectral analysis in broad band energy range .",
    "the @xmath1103 s pulsation is detected both in hxd / pin and xis light curves of the pulsar .",
    "apart from the primary dip , the pulse profile at soft x - rays shows a dip like structure which disappears at higher energies . when the source spectrum was modeled by a cut - off power - law continuum model with a blackbody component for the soft excess , it yielded a blackbody temperature of @xmath11.36 kev .",
    "however , the npex continuum model provided a blackbody component of @xmath10.16 kev temperature , which is common in case of accretion powered x - ray pulsars , along with a weak iron emission line of equivalent width of about 25 ev .",
    "the value of the absorption column density ( n@xmath41 ) is found to be higher than that of the galactic value towards the pulsar .",
    "the pulsating nature of the blackbody component , as seen from the phase resolved spectroscopy , suggests that the accretion column and/or inner part of the accretion disk is the possible source of soft excess emission in a0535 + 262 .",
    "the iron line equivalent width remains more or less constant over the pulse phase with an average value of about 25 ev .",
    "this value of equivalent width is found to be high for a symmetric distribution of circumstellar matter corresponding to n@xmath41 of 5@xmath710@xmath40 atoms @xmath33 .",
    "this rules out the fluorescence from the atmosphere of the companion and fluorescence by the surrounding material in the line of sight as the dominant source of iron line emission .",
    "the pulsating nature of the iron line flux in phase with the hard x - ray ( npex ) flux suggests that the inner part of the accretion disk is the probable site of iron fluorescence emission .",
    "the authors would like to thank all the members of the @xmath0 science working group for their contributions in the instrument preparation , spacecraft operation , software development , and in - orbit instrumental calibration .",
