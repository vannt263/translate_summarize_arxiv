    "let @xmath1 be the electromagnetic vector potential , and let the corresponding electromagnetic field be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "further , let @xmath3 be a real valued function . consider the following system of equations",
    "@xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    the main goal of this paper is to describe a vortex - lattice type solution of this system of equations in two dimensions ( cf .",
    "figure ) by means of a finite difference approach .",
    "results obtained in this way suggest that in the continuous domain limit such a solution consists of a continuous function @xmath3 and a connection @xmath1 whose curvature @xmath7-form @xmath8 is also continuous .",
    "moreover , the equations are satisfied in the classical sense almost everywhere .",
    "note that the displayed numerical solutions are not defined at the vortex points .",
    "( here , the horizontal axes are indexed by discrete lattice points . )",
    "moreover , their scaling should be matched to a given physical system .    as explained in @xcite ( and in a simplified abelian version in @xcite ) , the particular form of this system is suggested by the geometry of principal @xmath9-bundles .",
    "purely phenomenologically ( [ syst0])-([syst2 ] ) can be motivated by evoking heuristics used frequently in the optical literature .",
    "namely , it is often assumed in optics that the nonlinearities arising in the interaction of radiation with matter can be accounted for by representing @xmath3 as a series in tensorial powers of @xmath8 with coefficients characteristic of the material .",
    "subsequently , one attempts to deduce properties of the coefficients from a microscopic theory .",
    "the shift of paradigm in this paper consists in assuming that @xmath3 depends in a geometrically invariant way on @xmath8 via equation ( [ syst2 ] ) , and @xmath3 remains essentially independent of the material except for a simple scaling .",
    "we will see below that in contrast to the soft optical nonlinearities , ( [ syst0])-([syst2 ] ) can not be understood as a small perturbation of a linear system .",
    "however , interaction of radiation with matter is described from the `` point of view '' of the former , and the electronic processes inside matter are never discussed directly .    in order to explain superconductivity by means of a microscopic theory ,",
    "one needs to display a mechanism that will let fermions overcome the obstacle imposed by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "a solution given by the famous bcs theory is based on the observation that when thermic noise is sufficiently low , it is energetically favored for electrons to join in pairs , known as cooper pairs , which behave like bosons .",
    "the bcs theory is in a certain correspondence to the ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "these are nonlinear equations for a complex valued function @xmath10 , often interpreted as an order parameter governing collective behavior of cooper pairs .",
    "periodic solutions of these equations in the form of vortices have been found by abrikosov in @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that strict validity of the bcs / gl approach , at least in its classical s - wave pairing version , is limited to low temperature superconductivity of metals .    on the other hand ,",
    "type ii superconductivity is known to occur in materials structurally different from metals , like ybco , and at relatively high critical temperatures . as many researchers pointed out",
    ", this suggests that mechanisms other than those encompassed by the bcs theory may be responsible for high temperature superconductivity .",
    "those aspects of solid state theory that go beyond bcs seem particularly attractive in terms of the possibility of merging with the nonlinear maxwell equations .",
    "it is possible that the new mathematical pattern introduced in this paper will be helpful in the description of the interaction of magnetic fields with composite particles . for illustration , consider the proposition that @xmath3 describes a locally varying _ filling factor_. in this interpretation , a part of the field gets entrapped in composite bosons , composite fermions , and laughlin quasiparticles , which in turn see only the remaining @xmath11-fraction of the field .",
    "if @xmath3 is a constant , this allows one to replace an electron picture with a composite particle picture , a suggestion that was present in science already ten years ago .",
    "however , if @xmath3 is a vortex - type solution , the composite particles will feel the vortex in @xmath8 , which should induce josephson - type effects .",
    "thus , while microscopic theory is always constructed with an _ a priori _ fixed filling factor , ( [ syst0])-([syst2 ] ) would reflect the behavior of magnetic fields on a coarser scale .",
    "the above is meant to evoke some of the basic notions and ideas present in modern materials science .",
    "more thorough reviews can be found in the articles featured in the very incomplete list of references below ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "consider the system ( [ syst0])-([syst2 ] ) on a two - dimensional flat torus @xmath12 . in this case",
    "@xmath13 implies @xmath14 for a constant @xmath15 . in addition , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the curvature of a certain connection @xmath1 , provided its cohomology class satisfies @xmath18\\in 2\\pi z$ ] .",
    "thus , the system of equations reduces to @xmath19 and @xmath20 suppose @xmath3 is a solution of the first equation with parameter @xmath15 .",
    "then for any @xmath21 , the function @xmath22 is a solution of ( [ tor1 ] ) with @xmath15 replaced by @xmath23 . at the same time",
    ", this rescaling does not affect ( [ tor2 ] ) in any way , since the ratio @xmath24 remains fixed .",
    "however , the system behaves differently with respect to rescaling of the independent variable . indeed , suppose @xmath3 satisfies both equations with parameters @xmath15 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , then defining @xmath27 , we have that @xmath28 satisfies ( [ tor1 ] ) and ( [ tor2 ] ) with parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , while its period is @xmath32 in both directions .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental fact that as a magnetic field normal to the surface increases , vortices should eventually collide with one another .",
    "( in physical reality they will at that point disappear together with the superconducting state ) .",
    "this fact is also important mathematically , as it allows us to first obtain a solution of ( [ tor1 ] ) with , say , @xmath33 , and then rescale the independent variable to satisfy ( [ tor2 ] ) .",
    "it appears that the system ( [ tor1])-([tor2 ] ) does not subdue itself to the standard techniques of variational calculus or topological analysis . in particular",
    ", perturbative methods do not apply to ( [ tor1 ] ) , and no solutions arise as a result of bifurcation .",
    "in fact , in view of the theorem below and the results of numerical simulations , solutions are objects very unlike the familiar vortex solutions of nonlinear pdes . to give some indication of the difficulties involved ,",
    "consider the following .",
    "the equation ( [ tor1 ] ) is the euler - lagrange equation for the lagrangian @xmath34 .",
    "however , this functional is neither bounded below nor above .",
    "indeed , let us note that @xmath35 for constants @xmath36 .",
    "on the other hand , let @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath38 , one easily checks that in this case @xmath39 . therefore , the best we can expect is to discover _ local _ extrema .",
    "additional difficulty stems from the fact that since ( [ tor1 ] ) always admits a trivial constant solution , we must devise a method of telling trivial and nontrivial solutions apart .",
    "we will now consider a finite difference model of the system ( [ tor1])-([tor2 ] ) .",
    "it is proven below that non - constant solutions of the discrete problem exist .",
    "the proof is independent of the number of points in the discretization ( @xmath40 ) but relies on finite - dimensionality essentially , and does not admit a direct generalization to the analytic case .",
    "however , all the universal parameters used in the proof , like the @xmath41-norm of @xmath3 and @xmath15 , are asymptoticly independent of @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we conjecture existence of the continuous domain solutions of ( [ tor1 ] ) that satisfy the equation a.e . in the classical sense and retain the particular vortex morphology .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following notation .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , where indices @xmath45 run through the discrete @xmath42-by-@xmath42 lattice .",
    "also , @xmath46 denotes the common five - point periodic discrete laplacian , i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the simplest two - point periodic gradient , i.e. say @xmath49 in particular , the discrete integration - by - parts formula holds , i.e. @xmath50 . consider the function @xmath51 pick arbitrary real numbers @xmath52 , fix a point @xmath53 , and a number @xmath54 two submanifolds in @xmath55 , @xmath56 and its boundary @xmath57 play a fundamental role in understanding the nature of critical points of @xmath58 . depending on the particular value of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ,",
    "the set @xmath62 is either empty , an @xmath63-dimensional spherical disk , or it degenerates to a point .",
    "consider the hyper - plane @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath62 is a spherical disk immersed in @xmath65 precisely when @xmath66 , the point closest to the origin of an open submanifold given by @xmath67 , is located inside the ball @xmath68 .",
    "one easily finds @xmath69 for all @xmath70 , and for it to be inside the ball , it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath59 and @xmath61 satisfy @xmath71 conversely , if condition ( [ a_and_c ] ) holds then @xmath62 is a nonempty spherical disk .",
    "formally , one needs to check in addition that @xmath72 is indeed a minimum of every function that satisfies the two other conditions in ( [ d ] ) , but this is straightforward . at this point",
    "i would like to point out that in the description of local minima of @xmath58 below , the parameter @xmath59 is physical , and with good faith can be regarded as the @xmath41-norm of the critical point , whereas the parameters @xmath73 are auxiliary and will converge to @xmath74 as the density of discretization @xmath42 increases to infinity .",
    "in particular , interpreting @xmath75 as an approximate value of the integral of the reciprocal of the function where @xmath58 attains its local minimum is erroneous since the function develops a singularity at @xmath76",
    ". the following theorem will be proven .",
    "fix constants @xmath15 and @xmath59 as above",
    ". for a certain choice of the constants @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , the function @xmath79 assumes local relative minima in @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , the corresponding critical point , say @xmath80 , satisfies the finite difference version of ( [ tor1 ] ) everywhere except one point , i.e. @xmath81 moreover , if @xmath15 is sufficiently large , then @xmath82 is not a constant function .",
    "[ minima ]    _ proof .",
    "_ it is convenient to first treat @xmath62 formally , and check that condition ( [ a_and_c ] ) is satisfied later .",
    "proceeding formally , let @xmath26 denote an outward normal vector to @xmath83 inside its ambient sphere , i.e. @xmath26 is tangent to the @xmath63-dimensional sphere @xmath84 and points away from the region @xmath62 .",
    "the main task is to show that @xmath85 .",
    "it will then follow from smoothness of @xmath58 ( @xmath86 is a linear operator and @xmath87 is smooth for @xmath88 ) that it assumes a local minimum inside @xmath62 .",
    "let us choose for @xmath26 the vector field defined by @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "a direct calculation shows that @xmath91 it remains to analyze terms one by one .",
    "first , since a function in @xmath62 assumes its minimum at @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath93 next , by definition of @xmath62 and ( [ the_m ] ) we obtain @xmath94 so that @xmath95 and therefore @xmath96 as an immediate application we obtain @xmath97 finally , we obtain the following inequality @xmath98 together , estimates ( [ first ] ) , ( [ second ] ) , ( [ third ] ) yield @xmath99 so far no assumption has been made about the constants . now , in order to guarantee existence of local minima one needs to ensure that @xmath62 is nonempty , and that the outer derivative is positive .",
    "both these requirements are met if we pick @xmath100 and @xmath101 with this choice of @xmath61 , ( [ a_and_c ] ) holds and if @xmath3 satisfying the first two conditions in ( [ d ] ) , assumed at some other point a value at least as small as @xmath72 , we would have @xmath102 , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath62 is nonempty . on the other hand , inequality ( [ nf_est ] )",
    "becomes @xmath103 which implies @xmath104 for @xmath42 sufficiently large .",
    "consequently , @xmath58 assumes a local minimum inside @xmath62 .",
    "equation ( [ tor_dscr ] ) is automatically satisfied because it expresses the fact that the component of the derivative of @xmath58 which is tangent to the sphere @xmath105 vanishes in all directions except possibly the @xmath76-direction .",
    "still , the local minimum @xmath82 could _ a priori _ be a function constant everywhere , except at the discontinuity in @xmath76 .",
    "this can be avoided by taking @xmath15 sufficiently large .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , the solution which is constant except at @xmath76 , say @xmath106 becomes unstable , i.e. it corresponds to a saddle point on the graph of @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , one checks directly that @xmath107 for @xmath108 tangent to the origin - centered sphere at @xmath109 , so that @xmath110 . now consider @xmath108 to be a non - constant eigenfunction of the discrete laplacian on a torus and let @xmath111 denote the corresponding eigenvalue . shifting it if necessary , we can assume that @xmath112 , so that @xmath108 is orthogonal to @xmath109 .",
    "we have that @xmath113 , and thus @xmath114 only if @xmath115 .",
    "thus , @xmath109 is not a local minimum for @xmath15 sufficiently large .",
    "moreover , since @xmath116 , @xmath117 converges to @xmath59 as @xmath42 increases .",
    "naturally , one can make sure that @xmath111 remains fixed regardless of @xmath42 by always picking @xmath108 to be a discretization of the same trigonometric function .",
    "this shows that a choice of @xmath15 which guarantees that @xmath82 is a nontrivial solution does not depend on the discretization . @xmath118",
    "the proof above depends essentially on the fact that all functions and manifolds are discrete . indeed",
    ", the constants @xmath119 we have used tend to infinity as @xmath120 , and some of the estimates make no sense in the limit .",
    "however , it is important that the magnetic induction @xmath15 and the @xmath41-norm of @xmath3 do not depend on @xmath42 . on the other hand",
    ", simulation shows that the discrete solution @xmath82 retains its particular morphology independently of @xmath42 , and is always subharmonic .",
    "in addition , multiplying ( [ tor_dscr ] ) by @xmath121 and inspecting the vicinity of the singularity we easily obtain @xmath122 , which is also expected to converge . in summary , we have enough evidence to believe that the figure above shows a good approximation to a strong solution of the continuous version of equation ( [ tor1 ] ) that would posess a vortex of lipschitz regularity .",
    "it is also consistent with the one - dimensional case , where solutions of the analogous nonlinear equation can be expressed in terms of a closed - form integral .",
    "i point out for completeness that continuity of such a positive solution @xmath82 guarantees continuity of @xmath123 , and by rescaling the independent variables we can satisfy the condition that the cycle of @xmath8 be an integral multiple of @xmath124 .",
    "this is sufficient to solve @xmath125 for @xmath1 on a compact surface , and the solution @xmath1 has sufficient regularity to retain its geometric interpretation as a connection @xmath126-form . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath1 contains all the information necessary to derive the basic tenets of superconductive electronics , like the josephson effect .",
    "it is important to realize that none of the propositions stated above necessarily rely on the lattice being a simple square lattice .",
    "most likely , a hexagonal lattice setting would yield the same qualitative results .",
    "the only reason for using a square lattice is to avoid overwhelming numerical complexity in experiments , as well as arithmetical nuisance in theory .",
    "i introduced the system ( [ syst0])-([syst2 ] ) in 1993 , and later investigated its properties in my thesis .",
    "some of those early results are contained in @xcite .",
    "the geometry was first given a loose but essentially correct physical interpretation in @xcite .",
    "this work is a departure from the bulk of current research i conduct in collaboration with professor r. r. coifman in the area of computational harmonic analysis . working with raphy",
    "is a stimulating adventure , and i want to thank him here for enhancing my understanding of mathematics .",
