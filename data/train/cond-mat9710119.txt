    "granular media have distinct behaviors from those of usual solids , fluids and gases @xcite . there are two particularly important features that contribute to the unique properties of granular materials : ordinary thermal fluctuations play no role because of the mesoscopic size of grains , and the interactions between grains are dissipative @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to maintain the dynamics of granular media in the long run , external driving forces are inevitable . both experiments and computer simulations show that the dynamical responses of granular media to external forces exhibit a wide variety of interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "traditionally , external energy flows into the granular system from the boundaries , either by shear @xcite or by other means @xcite .",
    "the behaviors of inelastic and elastic systems under the same situation are quite different .",
    "elastic systems , if contacted with a heat bath where energy flows into the system from the boundaries , will attain a homogeneous state with a uniform temperature ( average kinetic energy ) field .",
    "however , the local kinetic energy of granular systems exhibits spatial gradients due to inelastic collision if energy is input from the boundaries @xcite .",
    "a freely evolving granular medium may have uniform temperature , but that temperature is time ",
    "dependent @xcite .    a uniform and time  independent temperature",
    "is essentially required by the granular thermodynamics theories @xcite or by any effort to make a comprehensive comparison between granular materials and fluids at _ equilibrium_. recently there are investigations @xcite showing similarity between the steady states of granular materials and usual fluids at equilibrium .",
    "thus in order to study the properties of granular media free from the nonuniformity of temperature and anisotropy due to gravity , one needs to introduce an idealized system . in this paper , we carry out computer simulations in two dimensions of a model system satisfing the above conditions .",
    "the driving force is applied to each particle so that the external energy flows into the system uniformly .",
    "our main concern is the correlations in the steady state of the granular system where energy dissipation due to inelastic collision is balanced with the energy input .",
    "the spatial distribution of collision events , particle diffusion , density  density correlation and velocity  velocity correlation will be investigated by simulations .",
    "the results show that there are no characteristic spatial and temporal scales in the correlation functions , no characteristic energy scale in dissipation , and an anomalous diffusion of a test particle .",
    "we admit that the way of energy input uniformly to each particle in our model is difficult to realize in experiments . as we mentioned above , however , this kind of idealization is necessary to explore the properties inherent to systems with inelastic interations and to clarify the essential difference between granular materials and usual fluids .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model .",
    "numerical results from the model are given in section iii and we close the paper with section iv which is devoted to discussion .",
    "we consider @xmath0 hard disks ( particles ) of diameter @xmath1 interacting via collisions in a two  dimensional square cell of length @xmath2 with periodic boundary conditions in the x and y  directions . during a collision ,",
    "the relative velocity of two particles in the normal direction is reduced by the restitution coefficient @xmath3 while in the tangent direction the collision is elastic : @xmath4 \\hat{{\\bf   n}},\\\\[2 mm ] { \\bf   v}_j ' & = & { \\bf   v}_j + \\frac{1}{2 } ( 1+r ) [ \\hat{{\\bf   n } } \\cdot ( { \\bf   v}_i - { \\bf   v}_j ) ]   \\hat{{\\bf   n } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where primes indicate velocities after the collision and @xmath5 is a unit vector pointing from the center of @xmath6th particle to that of @xmath7th particle .",
    "the loss of energy due to the collision is given by @xmath8 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass of the particles .",
    "on the other hand , energy is input to the system after each time period of @xmath10 in the following way : the velocities are perturbed instantaneously by a random amount : @xmath11 where primes refer to the velocities after energy input .",
    "the components of , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are random numbers distributed uniformly between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the energy input rate is therefore proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "the way of adding energy to the system in eq .",
    "( [ heating ] ) can remove any macroscopic flow of the system since there is no preferable direction chosen .",
    "one  dimensional version of the present model was studied by williams and mackintosh @xcite with continuous energy input . here",
    "the energy is added to the system instantaneously after each time period of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we are able to use the event  driven algorithm @xcite to perform the simulations .",
    "an event is defined as a change of velocity either by collision or by energy input .",
    "the inelastic collapse singularity was observed in simulations of inelastic system @xcite .",
    "this is caused by the appearance of infinite number of collisions between a group of particles which are spontaneously arranged on a straight line @xcite .",
    "we avoid this singularity by a slight modified collision rule as introduced by deltour and barrat @xcite . at each collision , the relative velocity of the two particles is first computed ( eq .",
    "( [ col ] ) ) and then rotated randomly by less than 5 degrees @xcite .",
    "the parameters in our systems are the restitution coefficient @xmath3 , number of particles @xmath0 , system size @xmath2 and average density ( area coverage ratio ) @xmath17 .",
    "the diameter @xmath1 of particles is related to them by @xmath18 .",
    "we will keep @xmath19 throughout the simulations , and show the results for @xmath20 and @xmath21 unless stated otherwise .",
    "the heating period of @xmath22 corresponds to adding energy to the system about every five collision events for @xmath23 .",
    "starting from any initial configuration the system with dissipation ( @xmath24 ) reaches a steady state in the center of mass frame . since the energy input ( eq.([heating ] ) )",
    "does not guarantee conservation of the total momentum , we subtracted the average velocity from the velocity of each particle in order to remove the motion of the center of mass of the whole system .",
    "thus the velocity is defined in the frame moving with the center of mass as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "1 shows how the average energy per particle relaxes with time towards a steady state for a system with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "it is found that the relaxation is exponential as @xmath28 .",
    "we find that the relaxation time @xmath29 ( @xmath30 in fig .",
    "1 ) is independent of the initial state and is controlled by the model parameters .",
    "theoretically , we can derive the energy relaxation equation as follows .",
    "the system increases its energy as a result of external driving ( eq.([heating ] ) ) with an amount of @xmath31 while it decreases its energy at a collision according to eq.([eng_loss ] ) .",
    "the energy change rate is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants , depending on the frequency of energy input , number of particles and collision rate .    after averaging over a time interval much longer than the collision time ( which will be defined later ) , eq .",
    "( [ relax ] ) becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and we have made use of @xmath38 .",
    "a steady state with @xmath39 exists for eq .",
    "( [ relax2 ] ) . the time ",
    "dependent relaxation is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an integral constant depending on the initial condition .      in the steady state the collision rate is constant , independent of time .",
    "this is in constrast to the time dependent collision rate in the freely evolving granular medium where the total number of collisions increases as @xmath42 for homogeneous cooling @xcite . in our simulations",
    ", we count the total number ( @xmath43 ) of collisions starting from a configuration in the steady state .",
    "2(a ) shows that the total collision number is linear with time for all systems with @xmath24 .",
    "the slopes of the lines are the collision rates for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "one would expect that the collision rate should be an increasing function with increasing @xmath3 as the velocity ( therefore granular temperature defined below ) is larger and the collision is more likely to happen in the larger @xmath3 system .",
    "however , we find from fig .",
    "2(a ) that the collision rate increases as the degree of dissipation increases . fig .",
    "2(b ) is the dependence of the collision rate @xmath44 as a function of degree of dissipation @xmath45 .",
    "we find that the numerical data can be fitted using the following form @xmath46 where the exponent @xmath47 is found to be about @xmath48 for the data in fig .",
    "it is evident that the collision rate will diverge if @xmath49 is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the increase of collision rate with decreasing @xmath3 may be linked with the clustering mechanism found in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , by direct visualization the density nonuniformity is not as clear as in the situation of the freely evolving granular medium @xcite .",
    "3(a ) is a typical configuration taken from the simulation . to find out any correlation in the collision events , we therefore resort to the following method .",
    "we record the positions where dissipation takes place by , e.g. , taking the middle point s coordinates between each colliding pair . at each dissipation place , we draw a data point and by doing so for some time interval we obtain fig .",
    "we see clearly that there is clustering in the dissipation places .",
    "note that the clustering is not due to limited data points ( or short time observation ) .",
    "in fact , there are @xmath51 points in fig .",
    "3(b ) with overlap .",
    "we have confirmed this observation by longer runs .",
    "it is also verified that such a clustering phenomenon does not exist for elastic system without dissipation ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we observe that the clustering patterns change their positions and forms as time develops .",
    "the clustering will be quantitatively analysed in the next subsection .",
    "we now determine the time correlation of the locations of dissipation places .",
    "a dissipation ( a collision ) takes place in space @xmath53@xmath54 at time @xmath55 .",
    "we calculate the power spectrum of @xmath56 and that of @xmath57 and find that they are of power  law decaying form .",
    "since there is no difference between the spectra of @xmath56 and of @xmath57 , we make average over them to obtain @xmath58 .",
    "4(a ) shows the power spectrum for @xmath59 , displaying the form of @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "zero exponent reflects that clustering occurs during the dynamical process : the places where dissipation happens are more likely to be the locations for future dissipation . in this figure , the time period corresponding to a frequency ( @xmath62 ) is @xmath63 where @xmath44 is the collision rate in the system .",
    "the upper cutoff of frequency is @xmath64 and the collision rate @xmath65 .",
    "this cutoff of frequecy in fig .",
    "4(a ) corresponds to the time interval between two successive collisions ( its inverse is the collision rate ) . below that cutoff",
    ", there is no characteristic time scale in the clustering mechanism as indicated by the power  law scaling .",
    "this spectrum was obtained from the same process as shown in fig .",
    "we also note that the exponent @xmath66 depends on the restitution coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "as @xmath3 increases to @xmath50 , @xmath66 decreases to zero .",
    "4(b ) shows the dependence of the exponent @xmath66 on the restitution coefficient . as @xmath3 increases",
    ", the clustering becomes weaker so that the location of dissipation places becomes spatially more uniform .",
    "this is consistent with the real space picture as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) .",
    "the velocity distribution is found to be gaussian for all the cases .",
    "5 shows a typical distribution of the square of velocity in a semi  logarithmic plot .",
    "the linearity indicates that the velocity satisfies the gaussian distribution like the velocity distribution in usual fluids and gases at equilibrium .",
    "we will show in fig .",
    "7(c ) that the energy density ( @xmath67 ) has no spatial correlation , as expected from the uniform and random energy input mechanism .",
    "this means that the gaussian distribution of velocity is valid for any part of the system .",
    "in such a situation we can now define a granular temperature @xmath68 , a quantity that is uniform in the system .",
    "it should be noted that if the velocity does not satisfies the gaussian distribution the variance of the velocity does not have correspondence to the usual temperature but is just internal energy . from the statistical physics point of view",
    ", the gaussian velocity distribution ( maxwellian distribution ) comes from a very general consideration . in a conservative system , if the momentum enters into the hamiltonian only via the kinetic energy term , the gaussian distribution of velocity is valid irrespective of the potential energy form @xcite and the average kinetic energy is @xmath69 with @xmath70 the boltzmann constant .",
    "non  gaussian velocity distribution has been found in granular materials under shear @xcite and in fluidized beds of granules @xcite .",
    "we also find that only by uniformly energy input as in the present model without uniaxial force like gravity can the granular materials have the gaussian velocity distribution @xcite .    in fig .",
    "6 we illustrate how the granular temperature @xmath71 scales with the energy input rate and the inelasticity of the particles .",
    "we find @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant and @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the energy input rate .",
    "the exponent @xmath75 is found to be @xmath76 .",
    "we obtain this scaling form from simulations of @xmath77 systems with @xmath25 and @xmath26 by exploring the three dimensional parameter space @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath15 sets the values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath10 the values of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath79 , and @xmath3 the values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath48 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "we have measured the spatial correlation functions by calculating the following quantities : @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the particle density at position @xmath94 at time @xmath55 , @xmath95 is the momentum density in the @xmath66direction and @xmath96 is the energy density ( here @xmath97 is the @xmath66component of the velocity of the @xmath6th particle at time @xmath55 , @xmath66 and @xmath98 take the values of @xmath99 or @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the position of the @xmath6th particle ) .",
    "the @xmath102 means time average and the bar means space average .    from the second rank correlation tensor for the velocity @xmath103",
    "we define its transverse ( @xmath104 ) and logitudinal ( @xmath105 ) components @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to the relative displacement @xmath110 respectively .    for numerical calculations ,",
    "we first coarse  grain the system into cells of size of about @xmath111 .",
    "7 shows the plots of correlation functions of @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 vs. the distance of @xmath115 .",
    "since the system is isotropic , the correlation functions depend only on the absolute value @xmath116 . from fig .",
    "7(a ) , we see clearly the long  range correlation in the density fluctuation . for",
    "distance less than about @xmath117 , the correlation is positive while for larger distance the correlation is negative .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation of elastic system of @xmath118 where we find @xmath112 is zero for all @xmath119 . from fig .",
    "7(b ) we can see that both parallel and perpendicular components of velocity are correlated in the long range .",
    "for distance above @xmath120 , the perpendicular velocity correlation is negative .",
    "the results are different from those for the freely evolving granular medium @xcite where there is a characteristic length of vortices determined by the negative minimum of the perpendicular component of velocity correlation . here",
    "there is no negative minimum in @xmath121 for all @xmath115 less than half of the system size ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the lack of a negative minimum indicates no characteristic length scale in the system . for the parallel component of velocity correlation",
    ", one sees that long  range correlation is also built up for the whole system . in comparison , we find that for elastic system both parallel and perpendicular components are zero for any @xmath119 .",
    "these results make us speculate that our granular system is in a critical state which lacks characteristic length in correlations .",
    "7(c ) indicates that there are no correlation ( too weak to detect , if any ) in the energy fluctuation , which allows us to name the internal energy as granular temperature in analogy to the thermodynamics of usual fluids .",
    "we have also calculated the correlation in the fourier space .",
    "the structure factors are defined as @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the mass density and momentum density , and @xmath102 means time average .",
    "note that in the above integrals taking * r * = * r* will contribute a constant term ( irrepective of @xmath126 ) , which will be dropped in our calculations in the following , since we are not interested in the self  site correlations .",
    "thus one expects that both @xmath127 and @xmath128 for uncorrelated systems ( e.g. ideal gases ) are zero for non  zero @xmath126 . from the simulations with @xmath52 ( for which the energy  input procedure is not applied ) , we obtain that @xmath128 is indeed zero for non ",
    "zero @xmath126 .",
    "however , due to the finite size of the particles , small but detectable @xmath129 was obtained for non ",
    "zero @xmath126 , which is shown in fig .  8 .",
    "let @xmath130 denote the probability of finding a particle in @xmath131 given that a particle is in @xmath132 , @xmath129 can be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath133 taking the following hard  core exclusion into consideration , @xmath134 where @xmath135 , it is straightforward to obtain the form of @xmath127 @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are @xmath1dependent constants .",
    "8 indeed shows that @xmath127 for small values of @xmath139 obeys eq .",

    "zero @xmath126 for elastic systems ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "since the system is isotropic , we obtain the dependence of the structure factors on the magnitude of the wave vector @xmath139 .",
    "let us label the two quantities calculated as described above as @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "9(a ) ( b ) show their dependence on @xmath139 on log  log plot .",
    "the linearity indicates that the correlations are of power  law form , indicating no characteristic spatial scales in mass density and velocity density fluctuations .",
    "the power  law exponent in @xmath142 is found to keep at a constant value irrespective of @xmath3 and to our best estimation @xmath143 while the exponent in @xmath144 is dependent of the inelastity .",
    "9(c ) are the dependence of @xmath145 and @xmath146 on the restitution coefficient .",
    "one should note that the power  law scaling region becomes shorter as @xmath3 increases .",
    "+      let us now look at scaling in the energy scale .",
    "we focus on all energy dissipation during collisions .",
    "the energy change after a collision is @xmath147 .",
    "10(a ) shows one time series of dissipated energy in the simulation .",
    "10(b ) shows the distributions of @xmath148 counted during a long time run for three different restitution coefficients @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we see power ",
    "law scaling in the energy scale .",
    "the upper cutoff of the scaling ( @xmath152 ) is determined by the requirement that the energy dissipation rate @xmath153 is equal to the energy input rate ( @xmath154 ) where @xmath44 is the collision rate .",
    "we note that the exponent for @xmath155 decreases as @xmath3 increases and the upper cutoff ( @xmath152 ) decreases with increasing @xmath3 . for @xmath23 , @xmath156 .",
    "as @xmath3 approaches @xmath50 , @xmath157 decreases to zero .",
    "we have traced the trajectories for some randomly marked particles .",
    "11(a ) is a typical one .",
    "we record the particle positions @xmath53@xmath54 for a time period of 512 collisions per particle and calculate the power spectra of @xmath56 and of @xmath57 ( their average is denoted by @xmath158 ) .",
    "11(b ) and fig .",
    "11(c ) show @xmath158 for two different values of @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "11(b ) for @xmath23 , we see that there are two regimes separated by @xmath159 which corresponds to a time period of about @xmath160 where @xmath10 is the heating period . in the high frequency regime , @xmath158 is proportional to @xmath161 , corresponding to the normal diffusion . since the heating procedure is applied randomly as in eq .",
    "( [ heating ] ) , the diffusive behavior is easily understood in this short time scale regime .",
    "addtionally , we see from fig .",
    "11(b ) that different behavior exists in the lower frequency regime where @xmath158 is found to be proportional to @xmath162 with @xmath98 close to @xmath163 .",

    "the power ",
    "law scaling in the low frequency regime for @xmath158 is closely related to the power ",
    "law scalings presented in the above subsections . since the density fluctuation is correlated in space in a self  similar manner as indicated by the power ",
    "law scaling in subsection f , the jump of particle , depending on the local density fluctuation , may thus satisfy a self  similar distribution .",
    "this has a link with the lvy ",
    "flight random walk @xcite .    the anomalous diffusion of eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) , obtained in two  dimensional simulations , is apparently similar to the observation by lewis fry richardson in 1926 in the fully developed turbulent flow in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "dimensional analysis gives us the correlation of the fourier transformation of velocity @xmath166 with @xmath167 which is independent of the dimensionality .",
    "if @xmath168 , we have the kolmogorov exponent of @xmath169 . however , the velocity correlation displayed in fig .  9 for @xmath23 shows that @xmath170 .",
    "at present , we do not know whether this discrepancy is intrisic or not .",
    "it is possible that an anomalous exponent like the intermittency exponent in three  dimensional turbulent flow @xcite comes into play .",
    "the scaling results obtained in the preceding section are robust to the energy  input procedure we used .",
    "we have verified this by using different parameters for energy  input ( @xmath15 and @xmath10 ) and by using non  periodic energy  input mechanism .",
    "we find that the above results hold also irrespective of the average density provided that it is in the low density regime .",
    "for relatively high density , steady state can not be reached as the particles jam each other in such a way that the system is no longer in a `` gas '' state ( i.e. , the diffusion constant is approaching zero ) .",
    "the scaling properties shown in section iii remind us of the concept of self ",
    "organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite . in our model",
    "we do not need to fine  tune a control parameter to obtain the scalings in space , time and energy scales .",
    "the self  organization appears automatically as far as @xmath24 .",
    "however , there are several important differences . in the common sense of soc",
    ", avalanches propagate through a medium .",
    "the medium is driven into a critical state by two opposite processes : external driving and avalanches disturbance ( due to threshold instability ) . in our model , there is no avalanche .",
    "energy is dissipated instaneously by collision .",
    "three processes are responsible for the evolution of the system : external driving , energy dissipation and self  evolving due to the velocity field .",
    "the last factor is lacking in the soc of the sandpile model .",
    "our model is also different from turbulence of ordinary fluids @xcite . in a fully developed turbulence",
    ", there is a cascade phenomenon which is the origin of the scaling behaviors such as the kolmogorov scaling .",
    "the energy is input to the system in a macroscopic scale , and then transfered into shorter scales and finally dissipated at a microscopic length scale due to viscosity . in our model",
    "each particle gains kinetic energy randomly .",
    "therefore , there is no macroscopic length ( except the system size ) asscociated with the energy input . in this sense",
    "the reynolds number is negligiblly small in our system .",
    "we have obtained an anomalous diffusion of a test particle , which is similar to the richardson law .",
    "however , it should be noted that our system is in two dimensions and that scaling properties in two dimensions are quite different from those in three dimensions in ordinary fluid turbulence . for further theoretical studies for the scalings obtained here , one might need to take into account a new non - dimensional parameter @xcite controlled by dissipation due to inelastic collision .    in conclusion",
    "we have shown by a well  designed model that essential differences exist between granular systems and elastic ones . by self ",
    "organization our system reaches a critical state where there are no characteristic spatial and temporal scales in correlations , and no characteristic energy scale in dissipation .",
