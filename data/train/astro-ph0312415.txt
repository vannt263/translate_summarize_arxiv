    "imagine an earth like civilization which developed on an isolated planet away from any star or galaxy .",
    "an astronomer there , faced with the spectrum of a spatially unresolved galaxy , will deduce it is made of dense gas `` clumps '' with @xmath0  @xmath1 and @xmath2  k. yet , he will have almost no idea of the true nature of galaxies . here ,",
    "on earth , we may be facing a similar difficulty when trying to understand the blr just based on its spectrum .",
    "photoionization calculations have reached a high level of sophistication , providing good constraints on the density , temperature , ionization level , chemical abundances and spatial distribution of the gas in the blr ( e.g. ferland , these proceedings ) .",
    "however , these calculations do not reveal the origin of the gas .",
    "is it made of individual  clouds \" produced by e.g. bloated stars , tidally disrupted stars , a gravitationally unstable outer disk , or a wind interaction with sn remnants ? or , is it made of a continuous flow , e.g. a wind driven off an accretion disk by radiation pressure , magnetic pressure , or both ? what determines the location of the blr ?",
    "is it accretion disk physics ?",
    "furthermore , agn show many emission lines with a large range in strengths and profiles , yet these emission properties are strongly correlated , suggesting there may be just a few free parameters which control these properties .",
    "what are these free parameters ? in this short review",
    "i will briefly describe some of the progress made towards answering the above questions , and some potentially useful new approaches .",
    "photoionization calculations tell us the thickness of the line emitting layers , and their solid angle , but they do net tell us whether the gas is composed of many small units ( e.g. bloated stellar atmospheres ) , a few larger units ( e.g. tidally disrupted stars , wind interaction with supernovae remnants ) , or a single continuous flow ( e.g. a disk outflow ) .    the number of  clouds \" in the blr , @xmath3 , and their size , @xmath4 , can be constrained based on the smoothness of the emission line profiles .",
    "the level of fluctuations in the emission line profiles is proportional to @xmath5 ( see capriotti et al .",
    "1981 for a nice simulation ) , assuming the cloud velocities are randomly distributed within the line profile .",
    "the total solid area subtended by the blr clouds is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the blr radius .",
    "photoionization calculations indicate that @xmath8 , and thus @xmath9 .",
    "very high spectral resolution and s / n observations allow a large lower limits on @xmath3 , and thus a tight upper limit on @xmath4 , in particular in low luminosity objects where @xmath7 is expected to be small .    a recent study of the h@xmath10 profile by arav et al . ( 1998 ) using a very high s / n keck spectrum placed a limit of @xmath11 in ngc  4151 , where @xmath12@xmath13  erg  s@xmath14 . a similar study by dietrich et al . ( 1999 ) in 3c  273 , where @xmath12@xmath15  erg  s@xmath14 , yielded @xmath16 . in figure  1",
    "we show a high quality keck spectrum of the h@xmath10 profile in ngc  4395 , the least luminous seyfert  1 galaxy , where @xmath12@xmath17  erg  s@xmath14 . at this luminosity one",
    "expects @xmath18  cm , if @xmath19 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , or @xmath20  cm , if @xmath21 . in the bloated stars scenario ( alexander & netzer 1994 )",
    "the size of the individual stars is @xmath22  cm , thus only a handful of such stars can be accommodated in the blr of ngc  4395 .",
    "this contrasts with the smoothness of h@xmath10 in ngc  4395 which implies @xmath23 , and thus @xmath24  cm .",
    "the bloated stars scenario is therefore ruled out , together with other scenarios which involve individual units significantly larger than @xmath25  cm .",
    "the smoothness of the blr profiles in the lowest luminosity agn therefore suggests that the blr most likely originates in a single continuous flow .",
    "there are various models which attempt to explain the formation of the blr based on accretion disk models .",
    "for example , it may arise in a gravitationally unstable outer disk , a disk outflow resulting from a combination of disk instability and a confining disk corona , or various other disk outflow mechanisms .",
    "however , some of the models do not make specific predictions for @xmath7 , or otherwise predict that it should be a function of the black hole mass @xmath26 in addition to @xmath27 . these predictions may be inconsistent with the observations which indicate a rather tight relation of the form @xmath28  pc ( kaspi et al . 2000 ; peterson et al . 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath7 may be set by dust sublimation .",
    "dust embedded in the ionized gas strongly suppresses line emission when the ionization parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the column of the photoionized h  ii layer is @xmath30  @xmath31 , and the uv optical depth of dust is @xmath32 , which implies @xmath33 .",
    "thus , when @xmath29 the penetration of ionizing radiation to @xmath34  @xmath31 is suppressed by a `` dust wall '' , which converts the excess ionizing continuum to dust ir emission .",
    "the outgoing line emission is further suppressed due to absorption by the embedded dust .",
    "since all dust sublimates below @xmath35  pc , efficient line emission is restored at @xmath36 .",
    "dust sublimation thus provides a _ parameter free _",
    "mechanism for the outer boundary of the blr ( laor & draine 1993 ; netzer & laor 1993 ; ferguson et al .",
    "1997 ) .    just outside the blr",
    "the gas cools mainly by dust ir emission , producing the ubiquitous 3  @xmath37 bump .",
    "still further out low density gas with @xmath38 produces the nlr emission .",
    "further inward from the blr the density of @xmath39 gas increases , which leads to collisional destruction of the lines , and cooling mostly by atomic continuum radiation .",
    "thus , the dust scenario implies that reprocessing gas is not necessarily located just at the blr , but may be located at all radii , and the blr is just where the gas cools efficiently by line emission .",
    "the dust and disk blr scenarios imply different responses of the blr emission to ionizing continuum variations .",
    "if @xmath7 is set by the accretion disk structure then it is expected to respond to variations in the disk structure , which occur at most at the disk sound speed crossing time .",
    "since the sound speed in a thin accretion disk is well below the local keplerian speed , one expects changes in the blr structure to occur on timescales much longer than the dynamical time @xmath40 .",
    "any other mechanism which produces physical changes in the gas distribution in the blr can not occur faster than @xmath41 .    in the dust bounded blr hypothesis , reprocessing gas is present at all radii , and changes in @xmath7 occur at the dust sublimation and reformation timescale .",
    "the sublimation timescale just outside the blr is @xmath42  s , and one thus expects that an increase in @xmath27 should be accompanied by an increase in the broad line core flux from the outer blr with a delay of only @xmath43 . since @xmath44 the dust scenario allows profile variations which are 100 times faster ( ! ) than the fastest variability timescale allowed by physical changes in the blr ( e.g. the disk blr scenario ) .",
    "when @xmath27 decreases dust can reform at smaller radii , again maintaining the @xmath45 relation .",
    "however , dust condensation is a much slower processes ( @xmath46  s ) , and since nucleation can not start in a @xmath47  k photoionized gas , it will take @xmath48 to get a fresh supply of dusty gas into the outer blr .",
    "thus , if @xmath7 is set by dust sublimation then @xmath49 will show a _ hysteresis effect _",
    ", i.e. it will follow the @xmath45 relation when @xmath27 increases , but when @xmath27 decreases @xmath7 will respond with a delay of at least @xmath41 . in the disk scenario",
    "there should not be any clear asymmetry in the response of @xmath7 to luminosity increases vs. decreases .",
    "finally , a corresponding hysteresis effect should be observed in the response of the 3  @xmath37 dust emission to variations in @xmath27 .",
    "some agn do not show any broad emission lines . while there is strong evidence that the blr is obscured in many agn",
    ", there are other cases where the blr appears to be truly missing ( termed true type 2 agn ) .",
    "_ why do some agn do not have a blr ? _    the distribution of observed broad line widths appears to have a cutoff at a fwhm of about 25,000  km  s@xmath14 ( strateva et al .",
    "2003 ) , though it is not entirely clear if this cutoff is due to a physical mechanism , or if it is due to some observational limitation .",
    "this cutoff implies that the blr will not be observable in agn with @xmath50 , as explained below .",
    "if dust sublimation sets @xmath45 , and if gravity sets the blr line widths @xmath51 , then these relations imply that @xmath52  km  s@xmath14 once @xmath53  erg  s@xmath14 ( laor 2003 ) .",
    "thus , if the blr is bounded from the outside by the dust sublimation radius , and from the inside by the radius where @xmath52  km  s@xmath14 , then at @xmath54 the inner and outer boundaries merge , and no region where the blr can survive exists once @xmath50 .",
    "thus all agn at @xmath50 should not have a blr .",
    "if the blr is produced by an outflow from a dense , thin , accretion disk , then the flow may not exist below some critical value of @xmath55 , either because of the outflow driving mechanism properties ( nicastro 2000 ) , or because the disk disappears altogether and becomes a hot and dilute thick inflow , which may occur at @xmath56 .",
    "thus , it will be worthwhile to obtain high quality observations of low luminosity agn ( where the host galaxy light has been carefully subtracted ) in order to 1 .",
    "determine if the cutoff at @xmath52  km  s@xmath14 is real , rather than a selection effect .",
    "2 . determine the critical luminosity which separates true type 2 agn from true type 1 agn .",
    "these observations will provide important clues for the physical mechanisms which control the existence of the blr ( see laor 2003 for further discussion , including the narrow line profiles ) .",
    "the seminal study of boroson & green ( 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) established the presence of a set of correlations among the h@xmath57 , optical fe  ii , he  ii , and [ o  iii]@xmath58 emission line properties .",
    "in particular they found that a narrow h@xmath57 line is associated with a weak [ o  iii ] , strong optical fe  ii , and a blue excess asymmetric h@xmath57 profile .",
    "bg92 speculated that the physical parameter underlying these correlations ( part of their eigenvector 1 , or ev1 ) is @xmath55 , in the sense that objects with a narrow h@xmath57 have a high @xmath55 .",
    "the main components of ev1 were later found to be strongly correlated with the x - ray emission properties , such that objects with a narrow h@xmath57 tend to have a steep soft x - ray slope .",
    "a steep soft x - ray slope was independently suggested to be associated with a high @xmath55 , which agreed with the bg92 speculation .",
    "further significant support for @xmath55 as the driving parameter came with the recent findings that the h@xmath57 fwhm allows a good quantitative estimate of @xmath26 , and thus that a narrow h@xmath57 is generally associated with a high @xmath55 ( see laor 2000 for a recent review ) .",
    "wills et al .",
    "( 1999 ) extended the bg92 correlation analysis to the uv , and found strong correlations of uv emission line ratios with the the ev1 optical emission line parameters .",
    "in particular , a narrow h@xmath57 is associated with weak c  iv , weak c  iii ] , and relatively strong si  iv+o  iv ] and n  v emission .",
    "these trends may reflect an increase in the mean blr density ( increasing si  iii]/c  iii ] ; gaskell 1985 ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ) , and metalicity ( increasing n  v / c  iv ; hamann & ferland 1999 ) with increasing @xmath55 . another very interesting feature is the apparent anti - correlation between the uv fe  ii and optical fe  ii emission , indicated by the spectral principal component analysis of shang et al .",
    "this effect is expected with increasing optical depth in the fe  ii emitting gas , as an increased number of resonance scattering of uv fe  ii photons leads to down conversion to optical fe  ii photons .",
    "the increase in optical depth may be due to an increase in the gas fe abundance and overall metalicity .    a possible scenario for the above trends in the blr properties with @xmath55 could be through some large scale process ( interaction ? ) which leads to a high rate of gas infall to the center , resulting in a nuclear starburst , and thus metal enrichment of the gas which continues its infall to the center , producing a high density high metalicity blr surrounding a high accretion rate agn .",
    "alternatively , warner et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that the blr metalicity is driven by @xmath26 , rather than @xmath55 .",
    "this is supported by the known relations between metalicity , bulge mass , and @xmath26 , in nearby inactive galaxies .",
    "further progress on the nature of the primary driver of the above relations can be made by making direct correlations of the various line emission properties with our best estimates of @xmath26 and @xmath55 using well defined and complete samples with high quality optical and uv data estimates as good as those obtained by the balmer lines ( baskin & laor , these proceedings ) . ] .",
    "finally , the starburst induced high @xmath55 scenario can be tested through high resolution multicolor imaging with the hst of well defined samples of nearby agn with high and low @xmath55 .",
    "the peaks of the high ionization broad emission lines are generally blueshifted with respect to the low ionization lines , and their profiles tend to show blue excess asymmetry , while the low ionization lines show less asymmetry ( gaskell 1982 ; wilkes 1984 , richards et al .",
    "2002 ) . in a given object",
    "the line velocity shift and asymmetry increase with the ionization level ( laor et al .",
    "1997 ) , and both effects appear to be strongest in narrow h@xmath57 agn ( baldwin et al .",
    "1996 ) . given the ev1 correlations mentioned above",
    ", it appears that the two effects are largest in objects with a high @xmath55 .",
    "such a relation may be formed by the following scenario .",
    "radiation pressure ablates the face of the blr  clouds \" , creating a radial outflow .",
    "as the outflow accelerates , the density drops and the ionization level increases , creating the increased line shift and asymmetry ( the redshifted outflow is presumably obscured ) .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath55 increases the column density of the radiatively accelerated layer increases , creating the apparent trends with @xmath55 .",
    "alternatively , richards et al . suggest the observed trends may be driven by an inclination effect .",
    "the origin of the line asymmetry can be verified by reverberation mapping of objects with highly asymmetric lines .",
    "if it is due to an outflow then the blue wing should respond faster than the rest of the line .",
    "the nature of the primary physical driver can be explored by correlating the observed properties against @xmath55 , and by comparing the observed trends with physical outflow models .",
