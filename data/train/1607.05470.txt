    "the process of electromagnetic @xmath0 pair production in heavy - ion collisions plays an essential role in collider experiments .",
    "it has a long history of experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "the process takes place in two different flavors dubbed as `` free - free '' and `` bound - free '' production , depending on whether the final electron is in the continuous spectrum or in the bound state with one of the nuclei .    as for the free - free pair production ,",
    "the pioneering papers @xcite appeared already in 1930-s and dealt with the high - energy asymptotics of the process . in late 1990-s the interest to the process has been revived due to the rhic experiment and approaching launch of the lhc experiment .",
    "in particular , the contribution of the higher orders in the parameters @xmath2 ( the coulomb corrections ) in the high - energy limit has been discussed intensively , see refs . @xcite and the review @xcite .",
    "the interest to the lepton pair production in collisions of slow nuclei appeared long ago in connection with the supercritical regime taking place when the total charge of the nuclei is large enough ( at least larger than 173 ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    recently , in ref",
    "@xcite the total born cross section of the free - free pair production has been calculated exactly in the relative velocity @xmath1 of the colliding nuclei .",
    "it turns out that the cross section is strongly suppressed as @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "a natural question arises whether such a suppression also holds for the coulomb corrections ( the higher terms in @xmath9 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the coulomb corrections are less suppressed with respect to @xmath1 than the born term .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 and @xmath11 and take into account the higher - order terms in @xmath9 amplified with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "we consider both free - free and bound - free pair production . in the next section we perform calculations in the approximation in which both nuclei have constant velocities , i.e. , we treat the nuclei as infinitely heavy objects and neglect the coulomb interaction between them .",
    "this approach has severe restrictions with respect to values of @xmath1 .",
    "these restrictions are discussed in the third section together with the qualitative modification of the results in the region where the constant - velocity approximation is not valid .",
    "let us first assume that the parameter @xmath12 is sufficiently small to be treated in the leading order . in particular , we assume that @xmath13 .",
    "we neglect the coulomb interaction between the nuclei and work in the rest frame of the nucleus @xmath14 with @xmath15 axis directed along the momentum of the nucleus @xmath16 .",
    "since our primary goal is the total cross section of the process , we find it convenient to use the eigenfunctions of angular momentum as a basis . in this basis",
    "the cross section has the form @xmath17 where @xmath1 is the relative velocity of the nuclei , @xmath18 is the space components of the momentum transfer to nucleus @xmath16 , @xmath19 is the electron energy , @xmath20 is the electron mass , and the corresponding quantities with tildes are related to a positron .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaff ] ) is performed over all discrete quantum numbers related to the states of both particles , i.e. , over the total angular momentum @xmath21 , its projection @xmath22 , and two possible values of @xmath23 , related to the parity of the state . within our accuracy ,",
    "the matrix element @xmath22 reads @xmath24 here @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the electron wave function with the energy @xmath27 , the total angular momentum @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "this wave function is the solution of the dirac equation in the attractive potential @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath31 is the negative - energy solution of the dirac equation corresponding to the charge conjugation of the positron wave function , so that @xmath32 in the derivation of eq .",
    "we have used the gauge in which the photon propagator has the form @xmath33    the limit @xmath8 is quite special . from kinematic constraints , it is easy to conclude ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the characteristic momentum transfers to both nuclei are of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "a simple estimate @xmath35 justifies using the small-@xmath36 asymptotics of the coulomb wave functions : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the spherical spinor , and the radial wave functions read @xmath40}\\\\ 1-\\underline{\\frac{r\\left(\\kappa-\\gamma\\right)}{\\left(2\\gamma+1\\right)\\eta_{b}}\\left[\\varepsilon\\left(2\\gamma+2\\kappa+1\\right)-m\\right ] } \\end{array}\\right .",

    "( [ eq : sigmaff ] ) is given by the terms with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "if we also assume that @xmath46 , then only the contributions of two states with @xmath47 survive .",
    "the underlined terms in eq .",
    "become important for @xmath48 . in this region ,",
    "in addition to the two states mentioned above , the states with @xmath49 equal to @xmath50 also should be taken into account . integrating over @xmath51 in eq .  , substituting the result in eq .",

    "when this ratio is small , the last term dominates .",

    "@xcite , as should be .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 appears due to the `` accidental '' suppression of the born amplitude of pair production and has nothing to do with the sommerfeld - gamov - sakharov factor .",
    "the bound - free pair production can be treated exactly in the same way as the free - free pair production .",

    "it is quite remarkable that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfspectrum ] ) can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffspectrum ] ) by the simple substitution @xmath59 followed by the replacement @xmath60 .",
    "this substitution works because of the factorization of hard - scale @xmath43 and soft - scale @xmath61 contributions .",
    "the total cross sections are obtained by the direct integration over energies ( energy ) ! ) are totally omitted in the annihilation current . ] : @xmath62 the main contribution to the integral is given by the region @xmath63 .",
    "note the cancelation of the terms @xmath64 in braces for both free - free and bound - free cross sections . while this cancellation for the free - free case is a trivial consequence of the charge parity conservation , for the bound - free case it comes as a sort of surprise .",
    "as it concerns the free - free pair production , the results and can be reproduced in a completely independent way .",
    "namely , one can obtain the matrix element of the process in conventional diagrammatic technique taking into account the diagrams shown in fig . 1 . and calculating the contribution of the region where all coulomb exchanges have momenta @xmath65 .",
    "pair production with the account of the first coulomb correction in @xmath66 . ]",
    "this contribution gives the correct amplitude up to the coulomb phase which cancels in the cross sections and .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath67 .",
    "then the higher - order terms in @xmath12 should be treated on the same basis as those in @xmath68 . however , the account of these terms is not reduced to the substitution @xmath69 in eqs.([eq : ffspectrum ] ) , ( [ eq : bfspectrum ] ) , and ( [ eq : totalcrosssectionb ] ) .",
    "speaking of the free - free pair production , the substitution @xmath69 should be taken into account on the level of matrix element , but not in the cross section .",
    "the relative phase between the contributions @xmath70 and @xmath71 to the matrix element can be fixed from the diagrammatic approach mentioned above .",

    "it is interesting that in the supercritical case , @xmath76 , the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath77 is opposite ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , since in this case at @xmath78 due to the energy conservation law the electron can be produced in the bound state but not in the free state .",
    "the results and are obtained in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "we show in this section that the account for the finite nuclear mass leads to an essential modification of both free - free and bound - free pair production cross sections at sufficiently small @xmath1 .",
    "one of the sources , which restrict the applicability of eqs .   and , is a deviation of the nuclear trajectories from the straight lines due to the coulomb interaction between the nuclei .",
    "this deviation can be neglected if a shift of the minimal distance between the nuclei is smaller than the impact parameter @xmath80 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the masses of the corresponding nuclei .",
    "substituting @xmath84 we come to the constraint @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the proton mass and @xmath87 .",
    "let us discuss qualitatively the modification of the cross section at @xmath88 .",
    "first of all let us consider the dependence of the cross section @xmath89 on the impact parameter @xmath80 at @xmath90 .",
    "similarly to the derivation of eq .  , we obtain @xmath91 integrating over @xmath92 we obtain the first term in eq .  .",
    "if we consider the classical motion of the nuclei interacting by the coulomb field , we find that the minimal distance @xmath80 between the nuclei and the relative velocity @xmath1 at this point are expressed via the impact parameter @xmath93 and the relative velocity @xmath94 at infinity as @xmath95 then the parameter @xmath96 in eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath97 calculating the minimum value of the quantity @xmath96 with respect to @xmath98 , we find that @xmath99 therefore , it follows from eq . that the cross section @xmath52 is exponentially small at @xmath100 .",
    "the same conclusion is valid for the bound - free cross section .",
    "suppose now that the condition holds .",
    "since the results and are strongly suppressed by the factor @xmath101 , it is natural to ask whether the contributions formally suppressed with respect to @xmath102 may dominate at sufficiently small @xmath1 .",
    "the answer is positive .",
    "let us consider the `` bremsstrahlung '' mechanism of pair production , when the pair is produced by a virtual photon emitted by the scattered nucleus .",
    "we consider the case @xmath103 when the motion of the nuclei is classical .",
    "then the cross section of the @xmath104 pair production can be written as a product of the cross section @xmath105 of bremsstrahlung of virtual photon with the energy @xmath106 and the probability of virtual photon conversion into @xmath104 pair .",
    "we assume that @xmath107 so that @xmath105 can be calculated in the non - relativistic dipole approximation .",
    "we have @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 and the functions @xmath110 has the following asymptotic forms @xmath111    it is seen from eq .   that @xmath112 is exponentially small for @xmath113 , which is in agreement with our previous statement . for @xmath114 , the main contribution to the integral over @xmath115",
    "is given by the region @xmath116 .",
    "then , taking into account that @xmath117 at @xmath118 , we obtain in the leading logarithmic approximation @xmath119 it is seen that the contribution to @xmath52 starts to dominate over very soon as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "let us discuss our results .",
    "we have calculated the infinite - mass limit of the free - free and bound - free pair production cross sections , eqs . and . as expected , the bound - free pair production cross section is much smaller than the free - free one , with the relative magnitude @xmath120 . in the region",
    "@xmath121 both cross sections essentially deviate from the results obtained in the leading order in @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to the `` accidental '' suppression of the born amplitude . in this connection",
    ", it is interesting to compare eqs . and with the corresponding cross sections @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the production of scalar particles .",
    "using the same technique we easily obtain @xmath124 the result for @xmath122 coincides with the asymptotics in eq .",

    "in contrast to the spinor case , the cross sections do not contain the terms of relative order @xmath125 since the leading - order contribution in @xmath9 is not suppressed by the power of @xmath1 anymore .",
    "we note that the coulomb corrections in eqs . and are still more strongly suppressed in @xmath1 than the coulomb corrections to the corresponding cross sections for scalar particles , though the suppression is only @xmath126 , which is to be compared with @xmath127 for the ratio of the leading terms in @xmath9 .",
