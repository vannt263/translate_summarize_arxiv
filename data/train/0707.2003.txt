    "in this paper , we consider the hochschild homology of soergel bimodules , and construct a geometric interpretation of it .",
    "this will allow us to explicitly compute the hochschild homology of a special class of soergel bimodules .",
    "soergel bimodules are bimodules over a polynomial ring , which appear naturally both in the study of perverse sheaves on flag varieties and of the semiring of projective functors on the bgg category @xmath4 .",
    "recently interest in them has been rekindled by the appearance of connections with link homology as shown by khovanov @xcite .",
    "khovanov s work showed that one aspect of soergel bimodules which had not been carefully studied up to that date was , in fact , of great importance : their hochschild homology .",
    "while the operation of taking hochschild homology is hard to motivate from a representation theoretic perspective , we argue that it is , in fact , naturally geometric , rather than purely combinatorial / algebraic .",
    "let @xmath1 be a connected reductive complex algebraic group , with lie algebra @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a borel of @xmath1 , @xmath3 a cartan subgroup of @xmath1 , @xmath7 be its lie algebra , @xmath8 be the rank of @xmath1 , and @xmath9 be the weyl group of @xmath1 .",
    "for any @xmath10 , we let @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath3 is a deformation retract of @xmath6 , so , we have @xmath12 for all @xmath6-spaces @xmath13 .",
    "we will freely switch between @xmath6- and @xmath3-equivariant cohomology throughout this paper .",
    "we note that @xmath14 is a closed subvariety of @xmath1 which is smooth if and only if the corresponding schubert variety @xmath15 is ( and thus @xmath14 typically singular ) .",
    "note that @xmath16 acts on @xmath14 by left and right multiplication , and that restricting to the diagonal , we get the action of @xmath6 by conjugation .",
    "of course , we also have left and right actions of @xmath6 but we will never consider these separately",
    ". we will * always * mean the conjugation action .",
    "now consider the graded ring @xmath17 $ ] , which is endowed with the obvious @xmath18-action .",
    "given a simple reflection @xmath19 , denote by @xmath20 the bimodule @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 is the subring of invariants under the reflection @xmath19 and , by convention , @xmath23 $ ] denotes the grading shift @xmath24)^i = m^{i+a}$ ] .",
    "we now come to the definition of soergel bimodules :    a * soergel bimodule * is ( up to grading shift ) a direct summand of the tensor product @xmath25 in the category of graded @xmath26-bimodules , where @xmath27 is a sequence of ( not necessarily distinct ) simple reflections .",
    "the motivation for studying soergel bimodules comes from representation theory , geometry and connections between the two .",
    "in fact , one has the following theorem :    ( soergel ) the indecomposable soergel bimodules are parameterized ( up to a shift in the grading ) by the weyl group ( * ? ? ? * satz 6.14 ) .",
    "the irreducible soergel bimodule corresponding to @xmath28 may be obtained as @xmath29 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5 ) , where @xmath30 denotes intersection cohomology as defined by goresky and macpherson @xcite .",
    "we choose our grading conventions on @xmath30 so that the 0th degree is the mirror of poincar duality , that is , so that the lowest degree component of @xmath31 sits in degree @xmath32 .",
    "more generally , soergel bimodules can be identified with the @xmath33-equivariant hypercohomology @xmath34 of sums @xmath35 of shifts of @xmath33-equivariant semi - simple perverse sheaves on @xmath1 .",
    "our central result is a geometric description of hochschild homology @xmath36 of these modules .",
    "[ sec : introduction-1 ] let @xmath35 be a semi - simple @xmath33-equivariant perverse sheaf on @xmath1 and let @xmath37 be its @xmath33-equivariant cohomology",
    ". then @xmath38 where @xmath6 acts by conjugation ( i.e. , by the diagonal inclusion @xmath39 ) .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath40    unfortunately , @xmath41 has a single grading , whereas @xmath42 has two : by decomposition into the components @xmath43 ( `` the hochschild grading '' ) , and one coming from the grading on @xmath44 ( `` the polynomial grading '' ) .",
    "this isomorphism takes the single grading on @xmath45 to the difference of the two gradings on @xmath42",
    ".    we can give a geometric interpretation of these gradings , but in a somewhat roundabout manner .",
    "a result of rasmussen @xcite shows that    [ intro - e - f ] assume @xmath46 or @xmath47 . then @xmath48 is equivariantly formal .",
    "thus , the map @xmath49 is injective and an isomorphism after tensoring with the fraction field of @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath50 by the knneth theorem , we can equip this @xmath26 module with a bigrading , with an `` equivariant '' grading from the first factor , and a `` topological '' grading from the second .    [",
    "grading - match ] the intersection cohomology @xmath51 obtains `` topological '' and `` equivariant '' gradings by transport of structure from the map @xmath52 and @xmath42 obtains the same by the isomorphism of theorem  [ sec : introduction-1 ] .",
    "these are related to the `` hochschild '' and `` polynomial '' gradings by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the degree of @xmath55 in the grading whose name begins with the letter @xmath56 .",
    "the case where @xmath14 is smooth is of special interest to us , so any reader who is unhappy with the presence of intersection cohomology and perverse sheaves can restrict to that case , in which case intersection cohomology is canonically isomorphic to ech cohomology .",
    "[ ind - hh ] if @xmath14 is smooth ( in any type ) , then the hochschild homology of @xmath31 is of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 are generators with @xmath59 for positive integers @xmath60 determined by the geometry of @xmath14 .    these integers can be calculated using the action of @xmath61 on the root system , or in @xmath0 by presenting @xmath62 as an iterated grassmannian bundle .",
    "while the indecomposable modules @xmath31 are perhaps most natural from the perspective of geometry or representation theory , definition ( 1 ) ( and the study of knot homology , which we discuss briefly in section  [ sec : knot - homol - soerg ] ) encourages us to concentrate on the modules @xmath63 .",
    "we call these particular soergel bimodules * bott - samelson * for reasons which will be clarified in section  [ sec : geom - soerg - bimod ] .",
    "bott - samelson modules are naturally identified with the equivariant homology of the `` groupy '' bott - samelson space @xmath64 and essentially the analogues of all appropriate theorems connecting the @xmath33-orbit closures in @xmath1 with soergel bimodules are true here .",
    "[ bs - match ] if @xmath46 or @xmath47 , then for all @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 the @xmath3-conjugation on @xmath67 is equivariantly formal , and the injection @xmath68 induces a bigrading on @xmath69 matching that on @xmath70 as in theorem  [ grading - match ] .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : knot - homol - soerg ] , we discuss the importance of the hochschild homology of soergel bimodules in knot theory . in section  [ sec : hochsch - homol - dg ] , we prove theorem  [ sec : introduction-1 ] , using the formalism of dg - modules , the relevant points of which we will summarize in section  [ sec : equi - derived - cat ] . in section  [ sec : geom - soerg - bimod ] , we will cover in more detail how to construct soergel bimodules as equivariant intersection cohomology of various varieties . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : equiv - form ] , we prove theorems [ intro - e - f][bs - match ] .",
    "the authors would like to thank catharina stroppel , olaf schnrer , allen knutson , shrawan kumar , peter fiebig , michel brion and tom baird for their helpful suggestions and wolfgang soergel for discussions which greatly enhanced their understanding of the equivariant derived category .    they would also like to thank the organizers of the conference `` microlocal and geometric methods in representation theory '' and the staff of schloss reisensburg , where the authors first began their collaboration , as well as nicolai reshetikhin , henning haar andersen and jrgen ellegaard andersen for making possible their visits to rhus , where this work progressed to its current state .",

    "this paper forms part of the his phd thesis .",
    "while soergel bimodules merit study simply by being connected so much delightful mathematics , we have applications in knot theory in mind , as we will now briefly describe .",
    "the interested reader can find more details in the papers of khovanov @xcite , rasmussen @xcite , and webster @xcite .",
    "the braid group @xmath71 of @xmath1 is a finitely presented group , with generators @xmath72 for each simple reflection @xmath73 , which is defined by the presentation @xmath74 note that if @xmath46 , then @xmath75 is the standard braid group familiar from knot theory .",
    "there are several natural weak actions of the braid group on category @xmath76 by families of functors ( see , for example , @xcite ) , which have an avatar on the bimodule side of the picture in the form of a complex of bimodules attached to each braid group element .",
    "the description of these bimodule complexes can be found in various sources , for example @xcite , or for general coxeter groups in @xcite .",
    "define the complexes of @xmath26-bimodules : @xmath77\\longrightarrow \\s{s}\\longrightarrow   \\hspace{2.5mm}0 \\hspace{2.5mm}\\longrightarrow \\cdots\\\\    f(\\si_s^{-1})&=\\cdots\\longrightarrow \\hspace{4mm}0 \\hspace{4mm}\\longrightarrow \\s{s}\\longrightarrow \\ht[1]\\longrightarrow \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the maps between non - zero spaces are the unique ( up to scalar ) non - zero maps of degree 0 .",
    "these maps are defined by ( respectively ) the pushforward and pullback in @xmath33-equivariant cohomology for the inclusion @xmath78 .",
    "the shuffling complex @xmath79 of a braid @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 ) depends up to homotopy only on @xmath82 not its factorization .",
    "in particular , @xmath83 so @xmath84 defines a categorification of @xmath71 .",
    "the maps in this complex also have a geometric interpretation : each degree is a direct sum of bott - samelson modules for subsequences of @xmath65 , and the `` matrix coefficients '' of the differential between these are induced by pullback or pushforward maps on @xmath33-equivariant cohomology for inclusions @xmath85 of bott - samelson spaces where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are subsequences of @xmath65 which differ by a single index .",
    "even better , this complex can be used to find a knot invariant , as was shown by khovanov @xcite .",
    "let @xmath88 be the hochschild homology of @xmath89 , which can be defined ( using the standard equivalence between @xmath90-bimodules with @xmath91 ) by @xmath92 this can be calculated by the hochschild complex of @xmath93 ( which is often used as a definition ) , or by the koszul complex , both of which are free resolutions of @xmath93 as an @xmath91-module .",
    "in the case where @xmath46 , hochschild homology is a categorification of the trace on the braid group defined by jones @xcite .",
    "remarkably , combining these creates a categorification of knot polynomials , which had previously been defined by khovanov and rozansky .",
    "( khovanov , @xcite ) as a graded vector space , the homology @xmath94 of the complex @xmath95 is depends only on the knot @xmath96 , and in fact , is precisely the triply graded homology defined by khovanov and rozansky in @xcite .",
    "applying theorem  [ sec : introduction-1 ] to our remarks above , we can understand the differentials of the complex @xmath95 in terms of pullback and pushforward on @xmath6-equivariant cohomology .",
    "since our readers may be less well - acquainted with the formalism of equivariant derived categories and their connection with dg - modules , as developed by bernstein and lunts , in this section , we will provide a brief overview of the necessary background for later sections .",
    "this material is discussed in considerably more detail in their monograph @xcite .",
    "suppose a lie group @xmath1 operates on a space @xmath13 .",
    "we have maps : @xmath97 a function @xmath98 on @xmath13 is @xmath1-invariant if and only if @xmath99 .",
    "it is therefore natural to define a @xmath1-equivariant sheaf on @xmath13 to be a sheaf @xmath100 on @xmath13 together with an isomorphism @xmath101 .",
    "( there is also a cocycle condition that we ignore here ) .",
    "one can show that if @xmath1 operates topologically freely on @xmath13 with quotient @xmath102 then the categories of @xmath1-equivariant sheaves on @xmath13 and sheaves on @xmath103 are equivalent .",
    "faced with a @xmath1-space , one would wish to define an `` equivariant derived category '' .",
    "this should associate to a pair @xmath104 a triangulated category @xmath105 together with a `` forgetting @xmath1-equivariance '' functor @xmath106 . for any reasonable definition of @xmath105 , there should be an equivalence @xmath107 if @xmath1 acts topologically freely as well as notions of pullback and pushforward for equivariant maps .",
    "the trick is to notice that , at least homotopically , we may assume that the action is free : we `` liberate ''",
    "@xmath13 ( i.e. make it free ) by replacing it with @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the total space of the universal @xmath1-bundle ( i.e. any contractible space on which @xmath1 acts freely ) .",
    "the first projection @xmath110 is a homotopy equivalence ( because @xmath109 is contractible ) and the diagonal operation of @xmath1 on @xmath108 is free .",
    "thus , we can consider the quotient map @xmath111 as `` liberation '' of @xmath112 .",
    "the following definition then makes sense :    the _ ( bounded ) equivariant derived category _",
    "@xmath105 is the full subcategory of @xmath113 consisting of complexes @xmath114 such that @xmath115 for some complex @xmath116 .    in the case where @xmath13 is a single point",
    ", we have @xmath117 , which is usually denoted @xmath118 .",
    "this is not exactly bernstein and lunts definition .",
    "consider the following diagram of spaces : @xmath119 they define an equivariant sheaf to be a tuple @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 is an isomorphism .",
    "however , the functor to the above definition which forgets everything except for @xmath124 is an equivalence of categories .",
    "as previously mentioned , it is natural to expect a `` forgetting @xmath1-equivariance functor '' @xmath125 . with @xmath126 and @xmath127 as in the previous remark",
    ", we may define @xmath128 . if @xmath129 is the inclusion of the trivial group , then @xmath130 ( @xmath131 is defined below ) .",
    "if @xmath132 is a subgroup , then we may take @xmath109 for @xmath133 and we have a natural map @xmath134 commuting with the projection to @xmath13 .",
    "the pullback and pushforward by this map induce functors @xmath135    similarly , for any @xmath1-space we have a map @xmath136",
    ". if @xmath13 is a reasonable space ( for example a complex algebraic variety with the classical topology ) push - forward yields a functor @xmath137 which commutes with the induction and restriction functors .    in this work",
    "we are interested in equivariant cohomology for connected lie groups .",
    "these emerge as the cohomology of objects living in @xmath138 .",
    "the first key observation of bernstein and lunts is the following :    if @xmath1 is a connected lie group then @xmath139 is the triangulated subcategory of @xmath140 generated by the constant sheaf .",
    "it turns out that this observation allows bernstein and lunts to give an algebraic description of @xmath138 . for this",
    "we need the language of differential graded algebras and modules .    a _ differential graded algebra _ ( or _ dg - algebra _",
    ") is a unital , graded associative algebra @xmath141 together with an additive endomorphism @xmath142 of degree 1 such that :    1 .",

    "@xmath146 , where @xmath147 denotes the identity of @xmath148 .    a _ left differential graded module _ ( or _ left dg - module _ ) over a differential graded algebra @xmath148 is a graded left @xmath148-module @xmath149 together with a differential @xmath150 of degree 1 satisfying :    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath152 .",
    "a morphism of dg - modules is a graded @xmath148-module homomorphism @xmath153 commuting with the differentials .",
    "if @xmath154 is concentrated in degree zero , then a differential graded module is just a chain complex of @xmath148-modules .",
    "given any dg - module @xmath155 we may consider @xmath156 , which is a graded module over the graded algebra @xmath157 . as with the category of modules over an algebra , the category of dg - modules over a dg - algebra has a homotopy category and a derived category as defined by bernstein and lunts @xcite .",
    "a map of dg - modules @xmath158 is a * quasi - isomorphism * if the induced map @xmath159 on cohomology is an isomorphism .",
    "the * derived category * of dg - modules for the dg - algebra @xmath148 , which we denote by @xmath160 , is the category whose objects are dg - modules , and whose morphisms are compositions of chain maps and formal inverses to quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "we denote by @xmath161 the full subcategory consisting of dg - modules , finitely generated over @xmath148 .",
    "given a morphism @xmath162 of dg - algebras we would like to define functors of restriction and extension of scalars .",
    "restriction of scalars is unproblematic ( acyclic complexes are mapped to acyclic complexes ) however a little more care is needed in defining extension of scalars .",
    "just as in the normal derived category , one needs a special class of objects in order to define functors . in @xmath160",
    "these are the @xmath163-projective objects @xcite which we will not discuss in complete generality . in the sequel",
    "we will only be interested in a special class of dg - algebras in which it is possible to construct @xmath163-projective objects rather explicitly :    let @xmath164 $ ] be viewed as a dg - algebra by setting @xmath165 and requiring that each @xmath166 have even degree .",
    "then all dg - modules which are free as @xmath167-modules are @xmath163-projective .",
    "let us now describe how to construct a @xmath163-projective resolution of a dg - module @xmath155 when @xmath168 is as in the proposition .",
    "assume first that @xmath155 has zero differential .",
    "we may choose a free resolution in the category of graded @xmath168-modules : @xmath169 we then consider the direct sum @xmath170 $ ] as a dg - module with the natural differential .",
    "for example , elements in @xmath171 are mapped under @xmath172 into @xmath173 using the corresponding differential in the above resolution .",
    "the natural morphism @xmath174 ( again induced from the resolution above ) is a quasi - isomorphism .    using standard techniques from homological algebra",
    ", one may give a more elaborate construction of a @xmath175-projective resolution for dg - modules over @xmath148 with non - trivial differential @xcite , but this will not be necessary for our results",
    ".    we may now define the extension of scalars functor .",
    "suppose we have a morphism @xmath162 of dg - algebras , and that @xmath148 and @xmath176 are as in the proposition .",

    "we will now describe equivariant intersection cohomology complexes , which will be important in the sequel .",
    "given a variety @xmath13 ( for simplicity assumed to be over the complex numbers ) , a smooth locally closed subvariety @xmath190 , and a local system @xmath191 on @xmath190 there is a complex @xmath192 called the intersection cohomology complex extending @xmath191 , with remarkable properties ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "it is worth noting that just like in the flag variety case , if @xmath65 is a reduced expression ( i.e. if @xmath240 is the length of @xmath65 ) , then the multiplication map is a resolution of singularities .",
    "let us explain how to calculate the @xmath230-equivariant cohomology of the bott - samelson varieties .",
    "actually , we will calculate the corresponding dg - module over @xmath216 .",
    "we start with a lemma :    suppose @xmath241 and let @xmath19 be a simple reflection . then : @xmath242    thanks to theorem [ equiv - thm ] we know that @xmath243 is equal to @xmath244 regarded as an @xmath245-module . hence @xmath246 however , @xmath216 is free as a module over @xmath247 and is hence @xmath163-projective .",
    "thus the derived tensor product coincides with the naive tensor product and the result follows .",
    "we can now prove the crucial `` formality '' claim mentioned above :    the direct images of the sheaves @xmath248 and @xmath249 in @xmath250 are formal .",
    "first notice that we can can write the sheaf @xmath251 as a iterated induction and restriction : @xmath252 hence by the above lemma , letting @xmath126 be the projection to a point : @xmath253 thus the proposition is true for @xmath248 .",
    "now , by the decomposition theorem of @xcite or more precisely , its equivariant version in @xcite , we may obtain @xmath249 as a direct summand of @xmath254 , if @xmath255 is a reduced expression for @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath256 is a direct summand of @xmath257 and is also formal .",
    "now , we will carry out some actual computations of @xmath6-equivariant cohomology , and thus of hochschild homology .    of course",
    ", the best setting in which to compute equivariant cohomology of a variety is when that variety ( or more precisely , the sheaf one intends to compute the hypercohomology of ) is equivariantly formal .            by theorem [ sec : introduction-1 ] , @xmath70 is free as an @xmath26-module if and only if @xmath263 is . by (",
    "* ? ? ? * propositon 4.6 ) , the module @xmath70 is free in type @xmath264 , so by definition / theorem  [ eq - for - def ] above @xmath67 is equivariantly formal .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath265 is equivariantly formal , where @xmath266 is the multiplication map . since all summands of equivariant formal sheaves are themselves equivariantly formal , and each @xmath249 appears as a summand of such a sheaf ( if , for example , @xmath65 is a reduced word for @xmath61 ) , this completes the proof of theorem  [ intro - e - f ] and the first part of theorem  [ bs - match ] .        as we mentioned earlier , we are interested in the hochschild homology of soergel bimodules as a bigraded object ( so that we get a triply - graded knot homology theory ) , but the grading on equivariant hypercohomology is only one of these . from now on ,",
    "we consider @xmath268 as a bigraded @xmath93-module , with the bigrading defined by the isomorphism with hochschild homology given by proposition [ formal - isom ] .",
    "since the pullback map @xmath269 is induced by a map of soergel bimodules , it is homogeneous in both gradings . similarly with the map induced by the inclusion of a summand @xmath270 .",
    "thus we need only establish the theorem for @xmath271 . as",
    "this is a union of complex tori with the trivial action , we need only establish the theorem for @xmath3 .",
    "let us turn to the case where @xmath14 is smooth .",
    "since @xmath274 , it will prove very interesting to understand @xmath275 .",
    "surprisingly , no description of this cohomology seems to be in the literature , but in fact there is a very beautiful one .    as is well known ( and we reprove in the course of lemma  [ schub - lemma ] below ) , there exists a unique decreasing sequence of positive integers @xmath276 such that the hilbert series of @xmath277 is of the form @xmath278                the number of times the integer @xmath290 appears in the list @xmath291 is precisely the number of roots in @xmath292 of height @xmath293 minus the number of such roots of height @xmath290 , where @xmath294 is the set of positive roots of @xmath1 and @xmath295 .    for ease ,",
    "assume @xmath14 is not contained in a parabolic subgroup . by results of akyildiz and carrell @xcite ,",
    "the ring @xmath277 is a quotient of @xmath296 $ ] by a regular sequence of length @xmath297 by a regular sequence @xmath298 where @xmath299 .    in this grading , @xmath296 $ ] is a polynomial algebra generated by elements of degree @xmath300 for each root @xmath301 , and the degrees of @xmath302 are given by @xmath303 as @xmath287 ranges over the same roots .",
    "corresponding to the simple roots are @xmath304 generators @xmath305 of degree 2 , which are the first chern classes of line bundles on @xmath306 corresponding the fundamental weights , and for the other roots we have @xmath307 other generators @xmath308 of higher degree . here , we assume these are in increasing order by degree .",
    "it is a well known fact that the cohomology ring @xmath309 is generated by the chern classes @xmath166 .",
    "since the natural pullback map @xmath310 is onto , the ring @xmath277 is as well . that is , if @xmath311 , then @xmath312 since @xmath313 , we can eliminate @xmath314 and any single relation @xmath302 such that @xmath315",
    "obviously , @xmath316 is again a regular sequence in @xmath317.$ ] applying this argument inductively , we obtain a subsequence @xmath318 which is regular in @xmath93 , which is the desired sequence .",
    "since the number of relations of degree @xmath319 which have been eliminated is the number of generators of degree @xmath319 , the remaining number of relations is precisely the difference between these , which is also the number of roots of height @xmath320 minus the number of height @xmath321 in @xmath292 .    applying the hirsch lemma ( as stated in the paper @xcite ) to the fibration @xmath322",
    ", we see that the cohomology ring @xmath275 is the cohomology of the dg - algebra @xmath323 where @xmath324 is the koszul complex of @xmath93 ( the natural free resolution of @xmath325 as an @xmath93-module equipped with the yoneda product ) .",
    "since @xmath288 is regular , @xmath277 is quasi - isomorphic to the koszul complex @xmath326 .",
    "thus , the cochain complex of @xmath14 is quasi - isomorphic to @xmath327 .",
    "this is just an exterior algebra over @xmath325 with generators @xmath328 with degree given by @xmath329 .",
    "if @xmath333 , where @xmath334 is a proper parabolic subgroup of @xmath18 ( with corresponding levi subgroup @xmath335 ) , and @xmath334 is the minimal such parabolic . then @xmath336 .",
    "since @xmath337 is unipotent and thus contractible , by knneth , we have @xmath338 thus , @xmath339 is equivariantly formal and the degrees @xmath60 for @xmath339 are simply those of @xmath340 extended by adding 1 s ."
