    "the gdel universe@xcite has several remarkable properties .",
    "it is homogeneous ( manifestly so in all studied versions of ` rectangular ' coordinates ) rotationally symmetric ( quite obviously , when viewed from an axisymmetric cylindrical system ) , anti - machian ( owing to its rotation as a rigid body in an inertial frame ) and acausal ( because its light - cone structure gives rise to closed null and closed time - like curves ( cncs / ctcs ) ) .",
    "its geodesics@xcite inevitably reflect one or more of its underlying properties . in both the cylindrical and kundt s version of rectangular coordinates , they project onto circles in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 planes respectively ( their closure being a direct consequence of the universal rotation ) and correspond , quite generally , to motion at a constant speed , @xmath2 . as @xmath2 increases , the radius of the circle increases as well , but remarkably , the time taken to circumnavigate it completely , as measured by an observer situated at any one of its points , decreases ! the largest geodesics are null curves , stretching out to the gdel horizon which marks the boundary of causal behaviour as also of the region which the origin can access through geodesics .    by subjecting our projectiles to a uniform acceleration , @xmath3 , orthogonal to their instantaneous velocities",
    ", we can force them onto orbits of ever larger radii and can thereby bring them back to the base - station ever earlier .",
    "so much so that for a critical acceleration , @xmath4 , we could bring them back instantly , and for an even larger @xmath3 , could bring them back before they were launched !    all of these properties can be depicted diagrammatically and some have in fact already been so captured . in an enlightening picture of the gdel universe in cylindrical coordinates , hawking and ellis@xcite brought out beautifully the refocussing of photons diverging uniformly from an arbitrarily chosen origin , the symmetrical tilting of light - cones in the direction of rotation , the emergence of cncs at the gdel horizon and their turning into ctcs thereafter .",
    "pfarr@xcite took the first step towards developing a similar sketch in kundt s coordinates , by tracing the corresponding geodesics , cncs and ctcs along with their planar projections .    in this paper ,",
    "we take pfarr s discussion to its logical conclusion .",
    "we start by showing that the extensions of geodesics he considered , correspond to motion at uniform speed and magnitude of acceleration , orthogonal to the instantaneous velocity .",
    "the wsas , as we shall refer to these extensions , have all the symmetries of geodesics and in particular the property of refocussing , which now gives rise to a truly intriguing series of diagrams : indeed , as we approach @xmath4 , the points of divergence and re - convergence draw ever closer , and finally coincide as @xmath5 .",
    "as we increase @xmath3 further , we eventually end up with open trajectories , and for even higher @xmath3 , trajectories which curve oppositely to the geodesics .",
    "trajectories for these values of @xmath3 have not , as yet , been studied in the literature .",
    "in fact , wsas provide a very convenient and insightful way of studying all the interesting phenomena associated with the gdel universe .",
    "we also present ways of visualising the general mechanism for the emergence of cncs / ctcs .",
    "indeed , by explicitly drawing a set of representative light - cones along the latter , we show how the tilting of these cones along with their opening out to include a spatial axis ( in addition to the temporal one ) allows us to complete the cnc / ctc .",
    "we first show this for cylindrical coordinates and then , in the backdrop of a manifest translational symmetry , for kundt s coordinates .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the control variables so to say for navigating gdelian space and time . by supplying the formulae and a diagram to show how",
    "these can be adjusted to access a coordinate time of choice , within a specified interval of proper time , we arrive at a practical travel guide for the gdel universe .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : cylgeodesic ] , we set up the equations of motion for planar geodesics passing through the origin in cylindrical coordinates and show that the geodesics have a constant speed .",
    "further , the geodesic of speed @xmath2 projects onto a circle in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane of diameter @xmath8 . in section",
    "[ sec : worldlineconstruction ] , we obtain a family of worldlines from the geodesics by stipulating that the diameter , @xmath9 , of the trajectory be independent of its speed , @xmath2 .",
    "we argue that the worldlines so obtained correspond to motion at constant speed and magnitude of acceleration .",
    "we calculate this acceleration by comparing each accelerated worldline with a geodesic which shares the same trajectory in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane . in section [ sec : cyltintegral ] , we determine the coordinate time , @xmath10 , and proper time , @xmath11 , taken to reach a given point on the trajectory of a worldline .",
    "we use these results in section [ sec : cylworldlineproperties ] to list several noteworthy properties of these worldlines , which we additionally capture diagramatically in section [ sec : cylvisuals ] .",
    "one of these diagrams lays bare an intuitive mechanism for the emergence of ctcs , which generalizes , in a certain sense , the one captured by hawking and ellis . in section",
    "[ sec : kundtkinematics ] , we rederive several of the above results in kundt s coordinates .",
    "we moreover use the manifest homogenity of this coordinate system to remove from the orbits of section [ sec : cylgeodesic ] the constraint that they must pass through the origin . in section",
    "[ sec : kundttintegral ] , we mimic the results of section [ sec : cyltintegral ] in kundt s coordinates . in section [ sec : kundtvisuals ] , we visualize these results from several perspectives .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our findings .",
    "our first objective is to construct ` planar ' wordlines in the gdel universe ( i.e. worldlines on the plane orthogonal to the @xmath12-axis ) which start from the origin and travel with a constant speed and magnitude of acceleration .",
    "such worldlines are considered because they fully exploit the symmetry of the universe , they are reasonably simple to handle and they are sufficient to illustrate the strange properties of the gdel universe .",
    "we first construct these worldlines in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath13 @xcite , for which the line element is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the angular velocity of rotation of the universe .",
    "the @xmath17 term has been dropped as we consider only trajectories restricted to the plane of rotation of the universe ( the @xmath18-@xmath7 plane ) .",
    "the calculation simplifies considerably @xcite , if we rewrite the metric in terms of @xmath19 ( which maps the entire space - time onto the interior of the unit circle ) : @xmath20    the effective lagrangian for a particle moving geodesically is then @xmath21 where @xmath22 for photons / material particles and @xmath23 . for material particles , @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath25 is independent of @xmath10 and @xmath7 , there are two constants of motion : @xmath26 @xmath27 note that @xmath28 for geodesics passing through the origin , while @xmath29 is related to the speed of the geodesic .",
    "indeed , the speed of a moving particle as seen by comoving observers is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 index only the space coordinates .",
    "in the present case , using @xmath33 , ( [ eqn : cyllagrangian ] ) and ( [ eqn : constantpt ] ) , we get a constant @xmath34    eliminating @xmath35 between ( [ eqn : constantpt ] ) and ( [ eqn : constantpphi ] ) to obtain @xmath36 and substituting this and ( [ eqn : constantpt ] ) into ( [ eqn : cyllagrangian ] ) to obtain @xmath37 , we get @xmath38 which readily integrates to @xmath39    it follows that geodesics which pass through the origin are circles in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane with diameter @xmath8 .",
    "solution ( [ eqn : geodesicorbit ] ) corresponds to a projectile from the origin with initial speed @xmath2 in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "the maximum radial coordinate it attains is @xmath41 , ie .",
    "@xmath42 , which for photons becomes @xmath43 .",
    "no geodesic from the origin can go beyond the circle @xmath44 , the gdel horizon .      to see how geodesics can be extended to worldlines with a constant acceleration , it is instructive to examine them in the non - relativistic limit . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the geodesic trajectories given by ( [ eqn : geodesicorbit ] ) are restricted to @xmath46 . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath47 and hence the trajectories in the @xmath18-@xmath7 plane are approximately @xmath48 , that is , circles of diameter @xmath49",
    ". this result can be obtained from a different perspective :    the comoving frame of reference @xmath50 is not inertial . at any given point",
    ", it looks like a rotating frame of angular velocity @xmath16 , with the axis of rotation passing through that point .",
    "there is a coriolis - like inertial acceleration @xmath51 on a particle moving with non - relativistic speed @xmath2 , perpendicular to the direction of motion@xcite .",
    "this provides the centripetal acceleration @xmath52 required to keep the particle moving with speed @xmath2 on the circle of diameter @xmath53 . setting @xmath54 and we get @xmath49",
    "of course , as seen from the local inertial frames , the geodesic has zero acceleration and is locally ` straight ' .    now consider the motion of a particle with constant speed @xmath45 along a circle of diameter @xmath55 .",
    "clearly the required centripetal acceleration @xmath52 no longer equals the coriolis acceleration @xmath51 .",
    "an additional acceleration @xmath56 in the radially outward direction would be required to maintain this trajectory at this speed . as seen from the local inertial frames ,",
    "these worldlines would be accelerated and would have just this acceleration @xmath57 .",
    "these worldlines have all the symmetry of the geodesics they have been derived from .",
    "all points on them are equivalent .",
    "they have a constant speed and an acceleration of constant magnitude , perpendicular to the velocity .",
    "all we need to do is extend this construction to the relativistic case .",
    "this can be done by considerng the worldine of a particle w moving at constant speed @xmath2 along the trajectory @xmath58 in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane , with @xmath9 specified independently of @xmath2 .",
    "the worldline is a geodesic only if @xmath59 . in general",
    ", each worldline of this 2-parameter family ( labelled by @xmath2 , @xmath9 ) has an acceleration , @xmath60 , which can be calculated neatly by comparing its worldline with that of a geodesic g of speed @xmath61 which projects to the same trajectory in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the 4-acceleration of the w worldline , @xmath62 , is @xmath63 while that of the geodesic g , @xmath64 , is @xmath65    the worldlines of w and g differ only in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 at which they reach a given point on the @xmath6-@xmath7 trajectory .",
    "so if we move along the two worldlines maintaining correspondence between points of same @xmath66 , then @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the metric and @xmath69 ( which depend only on @xmath6 ) are the same at the corresponding points of w and g , but @xmath70 and @xmath71 differ from @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "( subscript @xmath74 labels quantities for the geodesic g )",
    ".    the latter can be related by rearranging the defintions of @xmath2 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 @xmath77 to the form @xmath78 @xmath79 since @xmath80 is constant , @xmath81 and since @xmath82 is likewise a constant , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are identical at corresponding points , @xmath83 . therefore using ( [ eqn : cylgeodesiceqn ] ) , ( [ eqn : cylaccelerationdiffeqn ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath84    next , since @xmath85 differs from @xmath86 only in the @xmath10-component and @xmath87 for a stationary metric with constant @xmath88 , only @xmath89 contributes , and in view of ( [ eqn : dtdifference ] ) gives @xmath90 substituting into this , the only non - zero @xmath91 viz .",
    "@xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we get ] @xmath95 using ( [ eqn : dsratio ] ) to substitute for @xmath96 and ( [ eqn : vzerodef ] ) to replace the @xmath70 in @xmath97 and @xmath98 in terms of @xmath99 , simplifying the obtained fractions in @xmath100 and @xmath101 using @xmath102 and substituting @xmath61 , we find that the contravariant components of the 4-acceleration are @xmath103 \\left ( \\frac{2r\\sqrt{d^2-r^2}}{d\\omega(1-r^2)},\\ \\frac{r}{d},\\ -\\frac{\\sqrt{d^2-r^2}}{rd } \\right)\\ ] ] its covariant components are @xmath104 \\left ( 0,\\ -\\frac{r}{d},\\   \\frac{r}{d}\\sqrt{d^2-r^2 } \\right)\\ ] ] and its magnitude is @xmath105 thus the worldlines have a constant magnitude of acceleration @xmath3 determined entirely by the constant speed @xmath2 and the diameter , @xmath9 , of the trajectory . in general @xmath106 , and in this case @xmath107 .",
    "thus @xmath108 , which implies that the 3-acceleration is perpendicular to the 3-velocity , as desired .",
    "note that a is signed .",
    "when @xmath109 , the acceleration is opposite to the inertial coriolis acceleration .",
    "exceeds the coriolis term , the sense of the trajectory reverses and the acceleration becomes inwards .",
    "these trajectories can be described by @xmath110 and are discussed in section [ sec : cylworldlineproperties ] . ]",
    "this can be verified most easily by taking the @xmath45 limit .",
    "we get @xmath111 , where @xmath53 is the diameter of the trajectory in the @xmath18-@xmath7 plane ( i.e. @xmath112 ) .",
    "this result agrees perfectly with the non - relativistic arguments given earlier .",
    "the magnitude of the 4-acceleration , @xmath3 , is equal to the magnitude of the 3-acceleration in a local inertial frame ( lif ) instantaneously at rest with w. indeed , the thrust that a rocket of rest mass @xmath113 must generate to travel along the worldline w ( as seen in its own rest frame ) is @xmath114 , directed perpendicular to its velocity with respect to the comoving frame . in particular , if this thrust is generated by ejecting gas / accelerated ions at relative speed @xmath115 , the rate of ejection of mass ( in the rocket s rest frame ) is given by @xmath116    the lif is however not meaningful for a photon and indeed @xmath3 diverges as @xmath117 .",
    "is the magnitude of @xmath118 , and @xmath119 for @xmath120 . ] in this case , the required acceleration may be generated through forces applied by appropriately stationed objects comoving with the universe .",
    "the 3-force to be applied at any given point can be determined by transforming to the comoving lif the 3-force , @xmath121 , we have been dealing with in the rest lif of w .",
    "this can , in turn , be done by applying to @xmath114 a lorentz boost of speed @xmath2 perpendicular to @xmath122 .",
    "the result is @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the total energy of the particle that is to be forced along a wsa of speed @xmath2 and diameter @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath125 is perfectly well - behaved and hence meaningful at @xmath120 . as a concrete example",
    ", we could have an electromagnetic pulse ( @xmath120 ) of energy @xmath126 relayed across a series ( @xmath127 ) of comoving stations positioned along a circle of diameter @xmath9 on the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane .",
    ", this could be used for sending signals to the past . ]",
    "@xmath125 is then approximately the impulse imparted to the photons at each station , divided by the transit time between successive stations .    before analysing these results",
    "further , we derive the expressions for the coordinate time @xmath10 , and the proper time @xmath11 taken to get to a point on the worldline s trajectory in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane .",
    "we start by rearranging ( [ eqn : vdef ] ) , after eliminating @xmath6 from it using @xmath128 , to the form @xmath129 these can be recast to @xmath130 \\nonumber\\\\ \\omega(s - s_0 ) & = & \\frac{d\\sqrt{2}}{v}\\sqrt{1-v^2 } \\int^\\phi_{\\phi_0 } \\frac{d\\tan(\\phi-\\phi_0)}{1 + ( 1-d^2)\\tan^2(\\phi-\\phi_0)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and readily integrated for @xmath131 to has been defined with range @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "this makes this solution valid upto @xmath134 , ie .",
    "up until the worldline has completed one orbit . the solution can be extended to any number of orbits , by adding @xmath135 to the @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the number of completed orbits . ]",

    "all the above results have been derived with a worldline with @xmath143 in mind .",
    "but the results are valid for @xmath110 as well , if we consider negative @xmath9 to correspond to trajectories of diameter @xmath144 , but traversed in the opposite sense .",
    "case however , @xmath7 decreases with increasing proper time , and the worldline that leaves the origin with @xmath145 returns to it with @xmath146 .",

    "for an inward acceleration @xmath155 , the applied force assists the inertial coriolis acceleration and the trajectory shrinks to a @xmath156 . as the inward acceleration @xmath157 , @xmath158 and the trajectory shrinks to a point .",
    "for an outward acceleration @xmath109 , the applied force opposes the coriolis term , and makes @xmath159 .",
    "the trajectory continues to expand with increasing @xmath3 , upto @xmath160 , the critical ` escape acceleration ' @xmath161 at @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and we get the critical escape trajectory , namely , a semicircle with the point at @xmath164 removed .",
    "as we increase the acceleration further , @xmath9 increases , and the trajectories turn into minor arcs starting from @xmath165 and terminating at @xmath164 . the proper time taken to approach",
    "the @xmath164 point is infinite for all of them , as we would expect .",
    "when the acceleration reaches the value @xmath166 it exactly cancels the coriolis term , and the trajectory becomes a straight radial line from @xmath165 to @xmath164 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath167 ( as also to @xmath168 ) .",
    "higher accelerations produce circular arcs curving in the opposite direction , and hence corresponding to @xmath110 .",
    "note that the acceleration is now inwards , while the coriolis force is outwards . as @xmath3 increases beyond @xmath169",
    ", @xmath9 starts increasing from @xmath170 , and the trajectories are circular arcs of the opposite sense terminating at @xmath164 .",
    "this continues till @xmath3 reaches the value @xmath171 for which @xmath172 .",

    "a vestige of the underlying rotation is nevertheless visible in the definite orientation of all the light - cones , which confers on all geodesics a definite sense ( see figure [ fig : kundtgeodesics ] ) .",
    "moreover , even though geodesics diverging from a given point with the same value of @xmath2 end up describing circles of different radii , they continue to refocus is rather convoluted while that of figure [ fig : cyltimephicurves ] is very strongly @xmath40-dependent .",

    "to summarize , we have studied worldlines corresponding to motion at constant speed and magnitude of acceleration ( wsas ) . through these , we can access any point in the past or future of a comoving observer at the ` base - station ' where , because of the rotational symmetry of the space - time , these worldlines refocus periodically .",
    "we have extended the hawking & ellis depiction of this refocussing to the case of photons subject to a constant acceleration orthogonal to their instantaneous velocities . by adjusting the magnitude of this acceleration",

    "we have , additionally , studied cncs / ctcs more general than the ones which develop at / beyond the gdel horizon .",
    "in particular , we have shown how a critical amount of relative tilt in the light - cones of the space - time allows these curves to close , whenever the light - cones in question enclose a spatial axis in addition to the usual temporal one . the critical amount of tilt required for closure detemines the minimal size of the cnc .",
    "we have explicitly illustrated this for cncs of both the cylindrical and the kundt coordinate systems . since wsas lie on cylinders parallel to the time - axis in both systems , we have additionally traced the emergence of ctcs on more easily visualized 2-dimensional plots , by simply cutting open the cylinders , flattening them out and examining the curves they carry as functions of the acceleration .",
    "thirdly , we have explored wsas in their full generality by letting the acceleration range from @xmath170 to @xmath312 . in particular",
    "we have additionally examined both open trajectories , and trajectories that curve with the opposite sense to that of geodesics .",
    "lastly , we have derived formulae relating events in gdelian space and time to the speed and acceleration of point masses / photons which we would use ( in a controlled manner ) to travel between them . by carrying out the entire discussion purely in terms of parameters with a direct physical interpretation ,",
