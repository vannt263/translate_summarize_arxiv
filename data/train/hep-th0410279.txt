    "string theories have boosted the interest on higher dimensional spacetimes .",
    "this interest was renewed recently in connection to the tev - scale theory @xcite which suggests that the universe in which we live may have large extra dimensions . according to this conjecture",
    ", we would live on a four - dimensional sub - manifold , where the standard model inhabits , whereas the gravitational degrees of freedom propagate throughout all dimensions .",
    "studies on higher dimensional spacetimes have also raised the possibility that future accelerators , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern produce black holes , and thus detect indirectly gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "higher dimensional black holes , in particular , are providing a useful background to test the possible existence of extra dimensions .",
    "it is therefore important to discuss processes that might lead to the production of black holes in a higher dimensional background . among these",
    "there is one that deserves a special attention : the quantum schwinger - like process of black hole pair creation in an external field .",
    "this process allows the production of black holes with any mass , including masses that are well below the chandrasekhar limiting mass . in order to turn a pair of virtual black holes into a real pair",
    "one needs a background field that provides the energy needed to materialize the pair , and that furnishes the force necessary to accelerate away the black holes once they are created . in a 4-dimensional spacetime",
    ", the pair creation process has been discussed in several background fields , which can be : ( i ) an external electromagnetic field with its lorentz force ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , ( ii ) the positive cosmological constant @xmath3 , or inflation ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , ( iii ) a cosmic string with its tension ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , ( iv ) a domain wall with its gravitational repulsive energy ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "one can also have a combination of the above fields , for example , a process involving cosmic string breaking in a background magnetic field @xcite , or a scenario in which a cosmic string breaks in a cosmological background @xcite .",
    "to study the pair creation process one needs solutions that describe appropriately the evolution of the black hole pair after its creation , i.e , one needs solutions that represent a pair of black holes accelerated by the background field responsible for the pair production .",
    "these solutions include the c - metric @xcite and the ernst solution @xcite , that describe a pair accelerated by a string and by an electromagnetic field , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the higher dimensional c - metric and ernst solutions have not been found yet .",
    "therefore , pair creation of higher dimensional black holes in a cosmic string background or in an electromagnetic background can not be discussed analytically .",
    "however , the cosmological expansion provided by a de sitter ( ds ) background spacetime can also furnish the energy necessary for the pair creation process . in this case , the solution that describes the black hole pair after its creation is well known , it is the reissner - nordstrm@xmath1de sitter solution in higher dimensions @xcite , and can be used to study the pair creation process of higher dimensional black holes in a ds background . this task will be carried in this paper . in @xmath2 ( @xmath0 is the dimension of the spacetime ) , the pair creation rates have been previously computed in @xcite .",
    "pair creation of black holes is also a good source of gravitational radiation emission . in an higher dimensional flat background ,",
    "an estimate for the amount of gravitational radiation released during the pair creation period has been given in @xcite .",
    "after the pair creation , the black hole pair accelerates away and , consequently , the black holes continue to release energy . in a 4-dimensional ds background",
    "the gravitational radiation emitted by uniformly accelerated black holes has been computed in @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "in order to evaluate the black hole pair creation rate we need to find the instantons of the theory , i.e. , we must look into the euclidean section of the higher dimensional ds solution and choose only those euclidean solutions which are regular in a way that will be explained soon . to obtain the euclidean section of the ds solution from the lorentzian ds solution , ( [ rn : metric d - dim ] ) , ( [ rn : f cosmolog d - dim ] ) and ( [ rn : maxwell d - dim ] )",
    ", we simply introduce an imaginary time coordinate @xmath53 . to have a positive definite euclidean metric we must , in general , require that @xmath54 belongs to @xmath55 .",
    "a regular instanton solution is obtained when we eliminate the conical singularities that appear in the horizons .",
    "this is achieved by choosing appropriately the period of @xmath56 .",
    "for example , to eliminate the conical singularity at @xmath57 the period of @xmath56 must be @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the surface gravity of the cosmological horizon , i.e. , @xmath60 and , in general , this period also eliminates the conical singularity at the horizon @xmath23 if @xmath61 .",
    "we can construct four distinct regular instantons .",
    "below , we will describe each one of these four instantons , following the order : ( a ) cold instanton , ( b ) nariai instanton , ( c ) ultracold instanton , and ( d ) lukewarm instanton .",
    "these instantons are the higher dimensional counterparts of the 4-dimensional instantons that have been constructed @xcite from the euclidean section of the ds@xmath1reissner - nordstrm solution , and thus we preserve the 4-dimensional nomenclature .",
    "the cold instanton , the nariai instanton , and the ultracold instanton are obtained by euclideanizing solutions found in @xcite .",
    "these four families of instantons will allow us to calculate the pair creation rate of accelerated ds@xmath1reissner - nordstrm black holes in section [ sec : calc - i pc d - dim ] .",

    "moreover , the degenerated horizon @xmath26 , the mass parameter @xmath12 , and the charge parameter @xmath13 satisfy relations ( [ mq d - dim ] ) and ( [ coldddim : range ] ) .    in the cold instanton , the allowed range of @xmath54 in the euclidean sector is simply @xmath63 .",
    "this occurs because when @xmath44 , the proper distance along spatial directions between @xmath23 and @xmath24 goes to infinity .",
    "the point @xmath64 disappears from the @xmath65 section which is no longer compact .",
    "thus , in this case we have a conical singularity only at @xmath24 , and so we obtain a regular euclidean solution by simply requiring that the period of @xmath56 is equal to ( [ pc d - dim : period tau - ya pcds ] ) .",
    "the topology of the higher dimensional cold instanton is @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "the surface @xmath64 is then an internal infinity boundary that will have to be taken into account in the calculation of the action of the cold instanton ( see section [ sec : cold - rate pc d - dim ] ) .",
    "the lorentzian sector of this cold case describes two extreme ( @xmath34 ) ds black holes being accelerated by the cosmological background , and the higher dimensional cold instanton describes pair creation of these extreme black holes . to compute the pair creation rate of cold black holes we need to know the location of the cosmological horizon ,",

    "the topology of the nariai instanton is @xmath89 ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) .",
    "the lorentzian sector of this solution is the direct topological product of @xmath92 , i.e. , of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional de sitter spacetime with a @xmath8-sphere of fixed size .",
    "to each point in the sphere corresponds a @xmath93 spacetime . in the @xmath2 case",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the nariai solution decays through the quantum tunnelling process into a slightly non - extreme ds black hole pair ( for a complete review on this subject see @xcite ) .",
    "we then naturally expect that an analogous quantum instability is present in the higher dimensional nariai solution , as it will be shown .",
    "therefore , the nariai instanton describes the creation of a higher dimensional nariai universe that then decays into a slightly non - extreme ( @xmath94 ) pair of black holes accelerated by the cosmological constant background .",
    "the third regular instanton is defined by ( c ) : @xmath95 .",
    "it is regular when condition ( [ pc d - dim : period tau - ya pcds ] ) is satisfied .",

    "this instanton satisfies @xmath108 , and @xmath109 in this case the surface gravities of the horizons @xmath23 and @xmath24 are equal ( @xmath110 ) , and thus they have equal hawking temperature .",

    "the corresponding black holes may then nucleate in the ds background , and we have computed their pair creation rates in the last four subsections . however , these particular black holes are not the only ones that can be pair created .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in @xcite that euclidean solutions with conical singularities may also be used as saddle points for the pair creation process . in this way ,",
    "pair creation of nonextreme sub - maximal black holes is allowed ( by this nomenclature we mean all the nonextreme black holes other than the lukewarm ones that are in the region interior to the close line @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ range mq ds bh d - dim ] ) , and their pair creation rate may be computed . in order to calculate this rate ,",
    "the action is given by ( [ pc d - dim : i - electric ] ) and , in addition , it has now an extra contribution from the conical singularity ( c.s . ) that is present in one of the horizons ( @xmath23 , say ) given by @xcite @xmath213 where @xmath214 } \\,r_+^{d-2}$ ] is the area of the ( @xmath188)-sphere spanned by the conical singularity , and @xmath215 is the deficit angle associated to the conical singularity at the horizon @xmath23 , with @xmath216 and @xmath217 being the periods of @xmath56 that avoid a conical singularity in the horizons @xmath24 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the contribution from ( [ pc d - dim : i - electric ] ) follows straightforwardly in a similar way as the one shown in subsection [ sec : lukewarm - rate pc d - dim ] with the period of @xmath56 , @xmath218 , chosen in order to avoid the conical singularity at the cosmological horizon , @xmath57 .",
    "the physical interpretation of our exact results can be clarified with a heuristic derivation of the nucleation rates .",
    "an estimate for the nucleation probability is given by the boltzmann factor , @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the energy of the system that nucleates and @xmath221 is the work done by the external force @xmath222 , that provides the energy for the nucleation , through the typical distance @xmath211 separating the created pair . we can then show that the creation probability for a black hole pair in a ds background is given by @xmath223 , in agreement with the exact results .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath224 , where @xmath12 is the rest energy of the black hole , and @xmath225 is the work provided by the cosmological background . to derive @xmath226 one can argue as follows . in the ds case ,",
    "the newtonian potential is @xmath227 and its derivative yields the force per unit mass or the acceleration @xmath228 , @xmath229 .",
    "this acceleration should be evaluated at the characteristic ds radius , @xmath230 , yielding @xmath231 .",
    "the force can then be written as @xmath232 , where the characteristic mass of the system is @xmath233 .",
    "thus , the characteristic work is @xmath234 , where the characteristic distance that separates the pair at the creation moment is @xmath235 ( this value follows from the fact that the ds spacetime can be represented as a hyperboloid in a minkowski embedding spacetime , and the origin of the ds spacetime describes the hyperbolic trajectory , @xmath236 , in the embedding space ) .",
    "so , from the boltzmann factor we indeed expect that the creation rate of a black hole pair in a ds background is given by @xmath237 .",
    "this expression is in agreement with our results since from ( [ mq d - dim ] ) , one has @xmath238 , and thus @xmath239 .",
    "we have studied in detail the quantum process in which a pair of black holes is created in a higher dimensional de sitter ( ds ) background , a process that in @xmath2 was previously discussed in @xcite . the energy to materialize and accelerate the pair comes from the positive cosmological constant .",
    "the ds space is the only background in which we can discuss analytically the pair creation process of higher dimensional black holes , since the c - metric and the ernst solutions , that describe respectively a pair accelerated by a string and by an electromagnetic field , are not know yet in a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "as occurs for @xmath2 , the pair creation of higher dimensional black holes is always suppressed relative to the ds space , i.e. , the argument of the exponential function that defines the pair creation rate ( [ pc d - dim : pc - rate ] ) is always negative . to compare the evolution of the pair creation rate as the dimension of the spacetime increases , we note that this rate goes as @xmath240",
    "thus , for a fixed value of @xmath3 , the rate increases when @xmath0 grows , i.e. , pair creation of black holes in the ds background becomes less suppressed when the dimension of the spacetime increases .",
    "this behavior increases the interest of this kind of black hole creation process in a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "in previous works on black hole pair creation in general background fields it has been well established that the pair creation rate is proportional to the exponential of the gravitational entropy @xmath241 of the system , @xmath242 , with the entropy being given by one quarter of the the total area @xmath243 of all the horizons present in the instanton , @xmath244 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that these relations also hold for the higher dimensional ds instantons @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the cold case , the instanton has a single horizon , the cosmological horizon at @xmath57 , in its euclidean section , since @xmath111 is an internal infinity .",
    "so , the total area of the cold instanton is @xmath245 .",
    "thus , @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is given by ( [ pc d - dim : i - total - cold ] ) . in the nariai case , the instanton has two horizons in its euclidean section , namely the cosmological horizon @xmath57 and the black hole horizon @xmath23 , both at @xmath248 , and thus they have the same area .",
    "so , the total area of the nariai instanton is @xmath249 .",
    "again , one has @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is given by ( [ pc d - dim : i - total - nariai ] ) . in the ultracold case , the instanton has a single horizon in its euclidean section , the rindler horizon at @xmath177 , since @xmath189 is an internal infinity .",
    "the total area of the ultracold instanton is then @xmath252 .",
    "thus , @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is given by ( [ pc d - dim : i - total - ultracold ] ) .",
    "the ultracold instanton is a limiting case of both the charged nariai instanton and the cold instanton ( see fig .",
    "[ range mq ds bh d - dim ] ) .",
    "then , as expected , the action of the cold instanton gives , in this limit , the action of the ultracold instanton ( see ( [ pc d - dim : rangei - cold ] ) ) .",
    "however , the ultracold frontier of the nariai action is given by two times the ultracold action ( see ( [ pc d - dim : rangei - nariai ] ) ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior is clear .",
    "indeed , in the ultracold case and in the cold case , the respective instantons have a single horizon ( the other possible horizon turns out to be a internal infinity ) .",
    "this horizon gives the only contribution to the total area , @xmath255 , and therefore to the pair creation rate . in the nariai case",
    ", the instanton has two horizons with the same area , and thus the ultracold limit of the nariai action is twice the value of the true ultracold action .",
