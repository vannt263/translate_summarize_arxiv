    "synchronization of nonlinear dynamical systems have intrigued scientist in various disciplines studying the emergence of collective phenomena  @xcite .",
    "a large body of research has shown that the particular structure of connections between a system of nonlinear oscillators is crucial in determining the synchronization of the ensemble  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , determining effective network structures for a given dynamical system is far from a trivial task .",
    "the many classes of dynamical systems , as well as the various types of synchronization we aim to achieve , result in the absence of a unique ( or general ) network structure maximizing the synchronizability of the system . to this end , it is necessary to understand , for each particular case , how the dynamical system and the structure of connections are intermingled .",
    "for example , in the case of heterogeneous phase oscillators such as the kuramoto model  @xcite , the degree heterogeneity of the network  @xcite together with the spectral properties of the adjacency and laplacian matrices  @xcite , can help us to identify what networks are more prone to synchronize and even to asses the time required to reach the synchronization manifold  @xcite .",
    "when the state of the oscillators consist of more than just a single phase , possibly giving rise to chaotic dynamics , synchronization is more complicated . nevertheless , for an ensemble of identical systems coupled with diffusive coupling , it is possible to obtain a master stability function ( msf ) indicating the ability of a system to synchronize by evaluating the stability of the synchronization manifold  @xcite .",
    "extensions of the msf approach has been proposed for systems with slight parameter mismatch  @xcite , but still require that the oscillators are _ nearly _ identical .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed out that not only the stability of the synchronized manifold , but the basin of attraction is crucial for the synchronization of the whole system , particularly in real - world scenarios and applications  @xcite .",
    "the identification of a basin of synchronization is especially useful in real systems where the intrinsic parameter mismatch turns the msf not applicable .",
    "other approaches have been been developed more recently , allows a network to re - organize itself in the most adequate way . in this scenario",
    "it has been demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the nodes can be a driving force behind the evolution of the network structure @xcite .    within this framework ,",
    "a recent work has identified a new perspective in the analysis of synchronization of heterogeneous systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors show that given ( i ) a group of phase oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies and ( ii ) a given network structure , the precise location of the oscillators on the network has crucial consequences on the synchronization of the whole system .",
    "in particular , a _ synchrony alignment function _ ( saf ) can be defined that describes the interplay between the natural frequencies and the networks structure , and serves as an objective measure of the synchronization of the network . using the saf the synchronization properties of a network",
    "can be optimized by either ( i ) strategically allocating oscillators on a fixed network or ( ii ) tailoring a network to a fixed set of oscillators .",
    "this approach accounts for both the heterogeneity in the dynamics of the specific set of oscillators as well as the interactions dictated by the specific network structure . in other words , there is no unique optimal network structure universally valid for all possible sets of frequencies and networks  in general they have different optimal configurations .",
    "recent work has extended this approach to the case of directed networks  @xcite , ranking network edges for synchronization  @xcite and evaluating erosion of synchronization in networks  @xcite .    in this paper , we translate the concepts introduced in @xcite to the synchronization of chaotic oscillators .",
    "we hypothesize that phase - coherent chaotic oscillators with a clear dominant frequency can be treated as phase oscillators and , in turn , the saf describing the optimal interplay between the natural frequencies and network topology could be used to optimize phase synchronization .",
    "note that this heuristic argument relies on the fact that each dynamical unit is identified with a unique natural frequency , which is not the general case of chaotic oscillators .",
    "nevertheless , this simplification is reasonable for phase coherent systems @xcite as long as their power spectrum of the dynamical system is narrow enough to clearly identify a dominant frequency .",
    "we demonstrate by means of numerical simulations and experiments with nonlinear electronic circuits that the saf introduced in @xcite is applicable to phase - coherent chaotic oscillators and can be used to find optimal configurations in networks of heterogeneous chaotic oscillators .",
    "we also show how the use of the saf is robust both for random and scale - free topologies but can fail when non - phase - coherent chaotic systems are considered .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the oscillator model we are considering and the optimization method using the saf . in sec .  [ sec3 ] we present numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the optimization method for attaining phase synchronization in networks of chaotic oscillators . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we validate these numerics by presenting experimental results using networks of nonlinear electronic circuits . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we conclude with a discussion of our results .",
    "we begin by describing the dynamical system under consideration . specifically , we study networks of coupled rssler oscillators  @xcite , modified as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we choose this class of oscillator due to the fact that they represent a paradigmatic example of a class of phase - coherent chaotic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "next , we construct a network @xmath3 of @xmath4 rssler oscillators , which are diffusively coupled following the equations : @xmath5 \\label{eqrossler1}\\\\   \\dot{y}_i & = -\\alpha_i(-x_i+\\nu y_i)\\\\ \\dot{z}_i & = -\\alpha_i[-g(x_i)+z_i ] , \\label{eqrossler3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the nonlinear function allowing the oscillators to have a chaotic output .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the global coupling strength , each @xmath8 determines the frequency of oscillator @xmath9 , and the entries @xmath10 define the adjacency matrix @xmath11 of network @xmath3 , such that @xmath12 if a link exists between oscillators @xmath9 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "other parameters are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . under this parameter configuration ,",
    "rssler oscillators have a phase - coherent chaotic output in isolation ( i.e. , for @xmath21 ) , and their frequencies , @xmath22 , taken to be the position of the localized peak of the fourier spectrum , are proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "( this follows from the fact that , in isolation , the dynamics of oscillator @xmath9 acts on a timescale of @xmath23 ) .",
    "the fact that oscillators are phase coherent allow us to evaluate their phase synchronization disregarding the behavior of their amplitude .",
    "in particular , we define the phase of oscillator @xmath9 as the angle represented by the oscillator after projecting onto the @xmath24-plane : @xmath25 , as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the degree of phase synchronization of the network can be measured by the order parameter @xmath26 . here",
    "we investigate how the particular frequency of each oscillator is related to the position it occupies in the network and how this relationship affects phase synchronization .    to explore the existence of an optimal frequency - structure interplay",
    ", we will adapt the methodological framework introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of phase - coherent chaotic oscillators . in these papers",
    ", the authors showed that the degree of phase synchronization in a network of heterogeneous phase oscillators is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the _ synchrony alignment function _",
    "( saf ) . here",
    "@xmath29 is the vector of the natural frequencies of each oscillator and @xmath2 is the network laplacian whose entries are given by @xmath30 . in the case of symmetric adjacency and laplacian matrices",

    "we include a brief derivation of the saf in appendix  [ appa ] . given the setup of the system in eqs .",
    "( [ eqrossler1])([eqrossler3 ] ) , the heterogeneity of the parameters @xmath8 makes both @xmath31 and @xmath2 asymmetric , and therefore we use the asymmetric theory derived in ref .",

    "[ eqalign ] can be used to maximize @xmath35 ( i.e. , optimizing phase synchronization ) , in particular , by minimizing @xmath0 via investigating different configurations of a given set of natural frequencies and/or networks .",
    "we begin by constructing networks of @xmath36 nodes and @xmath37 links with and erds - renyi random configuration @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce heterogeneity by assigning the pseudo - frequency parameters @xmath8 randomly . specifically , we obtain each @xmath8 independently from a normal distribution with mean @xmath38 and standard deviation @xmath39 . by doing so",
    ", complete synchronization of the whole network can not be achieved , since systems are no longer identical .",
    "instead , we aim to maximize the degree of phase synchronization using the saf @xmath0 whose input is the distribution of natural frequencies and the laplacian matrices of the networks .",
    "the alignment function is used in two different ways .",
    "we first consider _ oscillator allocation _",
    ", where given a fixed network , we seek to arrange frequencies optimally on the network .",
    "to do so , we begin by allocating oscillators randomly and implement the following accept - reject algorithm : we propose a switch of two randomly - chosen oscillators , and accept the switch only if the new arrangement yields a smaller value of @xmath0 , repeating this process for total number of proposed switches . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rearrange](a - b ) we plot the results from simulations over a wide range of coupling strengths for networks with optimally allocated frequencies ( blue circles ) , randomly allocated frequencies ( red triangles ) , and poorly allocated frequencies ( green crosses ) .",
    "random allocations are given by the initial network and optimal allocations are obtained after @xmath40 proposed switches .",
    "poor allocations are similarly obtain , but aim to maximize @xmath41 instead of minimizing it .",
    "solid lines corresponds for the average of @xmath42 different random networks and error bars indicate the standard deviation from the average .",
    "we note that optimally allocated set of oscillators performs remarkably well , as shown by the order parameter @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rearrange]a ) , improving greatly on the random allocation with a sharp transition to a strongly synchronized state near @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , the synchronization error , obtained as @xmath44 also captures the benefits of the optimal alignment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rearrange]b ) , despite the fact that it never vanishes ( i.e. , achieves perfect synchronization ) due to the frequency mismatch of the oscillators .",
    "moreover , phase synchronization can also be mitigated by maximizing @xmath0 as demonstrated by the poorly allocated frequencies ( green lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : rearrange ] ) .",
    "second , we consider a _ network design _ approach , where given a set of oscillators with a predefined frequency distribution , we seek to build an optimal network structure promoting the phase synchronization of the whole ensemble .",
    "to do so , we initially allocate oscillators randomly on a network with a random configuration and implement a similar accept - reject algorithm : rather than switching two randomly chosen frequencies , we rewire a randomly chosen link . if the new network yields a smaller @xmath0 , we accept the rewiring , and otherwise we reject it . in fig .  [",
    "fig : rewire]a we plot the results of the order parameter @xmath35 from simulations over a wide range of coupling strengths for optimal ( blue circles ) , random ( red triangles ) , and poor ( green crosses ) network structures .",
    "random structures are given by the initial network and optimal structures are obtained after @xmath45 proposed rewirings .",
    "poor structures are similarly obtain , but aim to maximize @xmath41 . as in the previous case , we note that the optimally rewired network performs much better than the random network , displaying a sharp transition to a strongly synchronized state similar to the case of oscillator allocation .",
    "the corresponding synchronization error @xmath46 also shows that complete synchronization never reached ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rewire]b ) due , again , to the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution .",
    "again , phase synchronization can be mitigated by finding poor network structures .",
    "finally , we explore how the saf methodology performs in two other cases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : othercases]a we show the order parameter of oscillator allocation when the underlying network has scale - free structure . specifically , we consider networks with @xmath36 nodes with scale - free degree distributions @xmath47 for @xmath48 and minimum degree @xmath49 , obtained with the configuration model  @xcite .",
    "similar qualitative results are obtained both for the oscillator allocation and the network reconfiguration ( the latter not shown here ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : othercases]b , the dynamical system has been replaced by a lorenz system  @xcite , which is a paradigmatic example of a chaotic system that it is not phase - coherent .",
    "we summarize the dynamics and phase description of the lorenz system in appendix  [ appb ] . in this case",
    ", the ambiguity in the phase definition leads to a difficulty in defining an characteristic frequency for each oscillator , which in turn hinders the saf methodology in obtaining optimal configurations of frequencies and network topologies .",
    "in particular , we see that networks with `` optimally '' allocated frequencies ( blue circles ) perform no better than randomly allocated ( red triangles ) or `` poorly '' allocated ( green crosses ) frequencies in terms of phase synchronization or the synchronization error ( inset ) .",
    "next , we validate the robustness of the previous results with a real experiment based on an electronic implementation of a network of rssler oscillators . the experimental design of the whole network , and its control , is shown in figure [ expsetup ] .",
    "it consists of an electronic array ( ea ) , a multifunction data card ( daq ) , and a personal computer ( pc ) .",
    "the ea comprises 20 rssler - like electronic circuits ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the electronic schemes ) forming a network , whose structure can be modified maintaining the degree of each node .",
    "thus , as a contrast to the numerical results above , the ea is small in size .",
    "we translate variables @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and all the parameters appearing in eqs .",

    "[ tcexp ] .",
    "importantly , all chaotic oscillators have the same internal parameters with the exception of the capacitances @xmath58 that , in turn , define the natural frequency of oscillation of each unit . this way",
    ", capacitances take different values for the set @xmath59 , leading to a distribution of frequencies within the interval @xmath60 hz . the relation between @xmath8 of the theoretical model and the capacitances",
    "is given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "as a consequence , we obtain an ensemble of oscillators whose natural frequencies @xmath22 , in isolation , are inversely proportional to the value of the capacitances .",
    "note that , due to the tolerance of the electronic components ( between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , the frequencies of the oscillators also suffer a dispersion that goes beyond the nominal values of the capacitances .",
    "figure [ specpatron ] shows the power spectrum of the @xmath66 oscillators for @xmath21 , i.e. , in isolation .",
    "each rssler circuit has an individual electronic coupler controlled by a digital potentiometer ( xdcp ) , which is adjusted by a digital signal coming from ports p0.0 - 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] ) .",
    "the digital port p0.0 is used to set the value of the coupling resistance ( @xmath7 ) , while port p0.1 increases / decreases the resistance of a voltage divisor controlling the final coupling strength @xmath7 ( and allowing to test 100 discretized values of @xmath7 ) .",
    "all the experimental process is controlled by a virtual interface developed in labview , which can be considered as a state machine .",
    "this way , the experimental procedure is as follows : first , @xmath7 is set to zero , after a waiting time of 500 ms ( roughly corresponding to @xmath67 cycles of the autonomous systems ) , the signals corresponding to the @xmath68 variables of the 20 circuits are acquired by the analog ports ( ai 0 ; ai 1 ; ... ; ai 19 ) .",

    "the  natural frequency \" of each oscillators is obtained from the position of the maximum of their corresponding power spectrum . ]",
    "next , we evaluate the performance of the theoretical predictions given by the alignment function @xmath0 . we construct the specific network structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ expsetup ] , i.e. @xmath66 rssler oscillators with the frequency distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ specpatron ] and with a fixed average degree of @xmath77 .",
    "next , we obtain the synchronization parameter @xmath35 vs the coupling strength for three different configurations : ( i ) the optimal allocation according to an alignment function whose input are the average frequency of the oscillators and the laplacian matrix of the network ; ( ii ) a random allocation of the oscillators on the network and finally ( iii ) a poor allocation ( i.e. , maximizing the alignment function ) .",
    "figure [ drexp ] shows how the optimal allocation allows the ensemble of oscillators to synchronize at lower coupling strengths and a the same time , to reach higher values of the order parameter .",
    "a further inspection of the oscillators instantaneous frequency reveals the path to synchronization for both the optimal and random allocations .",
    "figure [ frectran ] shows the instantaneous frequency of the @xmath4 oscillators , indicated by the position of the highest peak of their corresponding power spectrum , as the coupling strength @xmath7 is increased .",
    "when the optimal alignment is implemented ( fig .",
    "[ frectran](a ) ) , we observe a frequency locking occurring at @xmath78 , which precedes the subsequent phase locking of the whole system reached for values of @xmath79 ( see blue line in fig . [ drexp ] ) .",
    "interestingly , figs . [ frectran](b)-(c ) show that deviations from the optimal alignment lead to , respectively , b ) the formation of frequency locked clusters preventing the whole system to synchronize and c ) the drift of a series of oscillators along the dominant frequencies of the system . in this way , we can observe that , in the case of random allocation , we obtain two different clusters of synchronization , which hold even for large values of @xmath7 and prevent to achieve the phase synchronization of the whole system ( fig .",
    "[ drexp](b ) ) . in the case of the network with the poor allocation , the situation is even worse , since a series of oscillators drift from cluster to cluster leading to an even lower value of the order parameter .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in @xcite , a positive correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath80 was reported .",
    "however , such correlations are not observed in our experiments , which can be attributed to the finite size effects related to the experimental limitations resulting in a low heterogeneity in the number of nodes ( @xmath66 ) , natural frequencies ( only three different frequencies are implemented ) and node degrees ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "our results show , both numerically and experimentally , that when aiming to synchronize a network of phase - coherent chaotic systems , there exists an optimal alignment between the frequency of the oscillators and the topological properties of the network . the existence of an optimal correlation is shown from two perspectives : ( i ) promoting synchronization by the correct allocation of a group of heterogeneous oscillators over a given network structure and ( ii ) allowing the network to reorganize according to an alignment function . in both cases",
    ", the alignment function introduced in @xcite for kuramoto oscillators correctly defines the optimal frequency - topology correlation for rssler systems with phase - coherent chaotic behavior .    at the same time , our results raise a series of questions to be addressed in the future .",
    "first , we have seen that the application of the alignment function to the lorenz system does not give successful results .",
    "this fact suggests that the alignment function of chaotic oscillators that are not phase - coherent needs to include , somehow , the complexity of the dynamics and not only the dominant frequency of the system . more generally , it raises the question of how to define new alignment functions accounting for power spectrums with large dispersion .",
    "is it possible to define a specific alignment function to each considered dynamical system ?",
    "what is the relation between the optimal topologies for different dynamical systems ?",
    "both questions require significant attention in the near future and might be addressed in part by blend the saf approach used here with of other approaches  @xcite . in addition , it would be interesting to carry out experiments with a number of nodes two or three orders of magnitude higher , which would allow to check the theoretical predictions regarding the generality of our results in scale - free networks ( which requiere a high number of nodes ) and the expected correlations between the degree of the nodes and their natural frequencies .",
    "on the other hand , there is a pristine field concerned about the identification of optimal topologies in real systems .",
    "for example , in brain networks , recent works have focused on the interplay between the dynamical and topological properties of different brain regions , and how the underlying physical connections constrain the functional networks associated to different cognitive and motor tasks @xcite . in this respect",
    ", the identification of alignment functions could help to understand the interplay between structural and functional networks .",
    "how close the actual configuration of a functional network is from the optimal topology and how a neurodegenerative disease may alter the possible alignment between dynamical and structural properties would be promising applications .",
