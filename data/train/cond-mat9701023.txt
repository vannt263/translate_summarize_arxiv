    "the properties of the normal metallic state of correlated electrons in @xmath3 dimension are usually summarized under the name luttinger liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "the single - particle green s function of a luttinger liquid exhibits several striking differences to the green s function of a conventional fermi liquid : the absence of a coherent quasi - particle peak , spin - charge separation , and anomalous scaling properties characterized by interaction - dependent power laws .",
    "non - fermi liquid behavior has recently been observed in several experiments .",
    "first of all , the normal - state properties of the high - temperature superconductors can not be interpreted in terms of a conventional fermi liquid picture @xcite .",
    "motivated by this experimental fact , anderson @xcite proposed that even in @xmath4 the single - particle green s functions of correlated electrons can exhibit luttinger liquid behavior .",
    "this unconventional normal - state behavior was then shown to be a possible key to understand the novel superconducting state .",
    "in fact , the interlayer - tunneling theory of high - temperature superconductivity advanced by chakravarty , anderson and co - workers @xcite is based on the fundamental assumption that in the normal state the single - particle green s function @xmath5 satisfies for wave - vectors @xmath6 sufficiently close to the fermi surface and for sufficiently low frequencies @xmath7 ( measured relative to the chemical potential ) an anomalous scaling law of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a wave - vector on the fermi surface , and @xmath10 is some interaction - dependent exponent , the anomalous dimension .",
    "a finite value of @xmath11 is one of the fundamental characteristics of luttinger liquid behavior , whereas in a fermi liquid @xmath12 .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that a generally accepted microscopic derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomalscale ] ) for interacting fermions in @xmath13 does not exist .",
    "another class of materials where non - fermi liquid behavior appears to have been observed experimentally consists of weakly coupled metallic chains @xcite , which are based on highly anisotropic conductors .",
    "although at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath14 these systems have the tendency to develop various types of long - range order , above the ordering temperature the metallic state displays clearly non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the interpretation of recent photoemission studies of these systems in terms of the luttinger liquid picture leads to values for the anomalous dimension @xmath11 in the range @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "because in one - dimensional lattice models with short - range interactions ( such as the hubbard model ) the anomalous dimension is always small compared with unity @xcite , the large experimentally measured value of @xmath11 suggests that the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction must play an important role in these systems .",
    "of course , the experimental systems are not strictly one - dimensional , because the interchain hopping @xmath0 is small but finite , and even for @xmath16 the electrons on different chains interact with three - dimensional coulomb forces .",
    "we thus arrive at the problem of weakly coupled metallic chains , which is the central topic of this paper .    in the last years",
    "the problem of coupled luttinger liquids has been studied by many authors .",
    "given the fact that in the absence of interchain hopping the non - perturbative bosonization approach can be used to calculate the single - particle green s function in a controlled way , some authors @xcite have attempted to supplement the one - dimensional non - perturbative bosonization solution by some kind of perturbation theory in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "one disadvantage of this strategy is that in this way interchain hopping and electron - electron interactions between the chains are not taken into account on equal footing . in this work",
    "we shall therefore adopt a different strategy : instead of combining one - dimensional bosonization with perturbation theory in powers of @xmath0 , we shall use the recently developed higher - dimensional generalization of the bosonization method @xcite to treat interchain hopping and interactions between the chains on equal footing .",
    "thus , our approach is non - perturbative in @xmath0 and in the interaction . in particular",
    ", for @xmath16 we recover the well - known one - dimensional bosonization result for the green s function of the tomonaga - luttinger model .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : bos ] we briefly describe the higher - dimensional bosonization approach . in particular , we emphasize the approximations inherent in this approach and discuss its limitations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thecoulomb ] we shall show how the problem of electrons that are confined to one - dimensional chains ( i.e. without interchain hopping ) and interact with three - dimensional coulomb forces can be solved in a straightforward way with higher - dimensional bosonization .",
    "of course , this problem can also be solved by means of the conventional one - dimensional bosonization technique @xcite . however , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : finiteinter ] , our approach can also handle the case of finite interchain hopping @xmath0 without having to rely on an expansion in powers of @xmath0 or in the interaction .",
    "although the quasi - particle residue is found to be finite for any @xmath17 , we show by explicit calculation that there exists a large intermediate regime where the equal time green s function satisfies an anomalous scaling relation similar to a luttinger liquid . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wenapproximation ] we compare our results with those obtained by other approaches .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we shall give a brief summary of the higher - dimensional bosonization approach .",
    "the foundations of this novel non - perturbative approach to the fermionic many - body problem go back to ideas due to luther @xcite and haldane @xcite .",
    "more recently , a number of authors have applied this technique to problems of physical interest @xcite .",
    "the basis of higher - dimensional bosonization is the subdivision of the fermi surface into a finite number of patches @xmath18 , @xmath19 . to be specific , let us consider in fig .  [",
    "fig : quasi1d ] a typical fermi surface associated with a periodic array of chains coupled by weak interchain hopping . a possible subdivision into @xmath20 patches is shown in fig .  [ fig : quasi1dpatch ] .",
    "each patch @xmath18 is then extended into a @xmath21-dimensional squat box @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squat ] . the characteristic size @xmath22 of the patches should be chosen sufficiently small so that within a given patch the curvature of the fermi surface can be locally ignored . on the other hand ,",
    "the cutoffs @xmath22 and @xmath23 can not be taken arbitrarily small , because higher - dimensional bosonization becomes only useful in practice if it is possible to ignore momentum transfer between different patches ( the so - called around - the - corner processes @xcite ) .",
    "of course , this is only possible if the interaction is dominated by forward scattering .",
    "more quantitatively , we assume that the two - body interaction @xmath24 becomes negligibly small if @xmath25 is larger than some cutoff @xmath26 .",
    "the geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squat ] . assuming that the nature of the interaction is such that the above condition can be satisfied",
    ", it is reasonable to make the following two approximations @xcite : first of all , we ignore momentum transfer between different boxes ( diagonal - patch approximation ) .",
    "the relative number of matrix elements neglected in this case is in @xmath27 dimensions of order @xmath28 .",
    "the second fundamental approximation is the local linearization of the energy dispersion .",
    "measuring wave - vectors locally with respect to coordinate systems located at points @xmath9 in the centers of the patches ( see fig .",

    "@xmath33 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath34 .",
    "note that in general the masses @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the patch - index .",
    "because in the grand - canonical formulation of statistical mechanics the energy dispersion appears only in the combination @xmath37 , the chemical potential @xmath38 cancels the constant @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) provided @xmath9 is chosen to lie exactly on the fermi surface .",
    "we now ignore all terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) that are quadratic and higher order in @xmath40 , i.e.  we approximate @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath42 is neglected .",
    "note that retaining this term would lead to patches with non - zero curvature .",
    "once we accept the validity of the above approximations , the single - particle green s function can be calculated without further approximation in arbitrary dimension . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the result for the matsubara green s function at finite inverse temperature @xmath43 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the debye - waller factor @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 with @xmath48 here @xmath49 are fermionic matsubara frequencies , and @xmath50 are bosonic ones .",

    "we now apply the above results to study the problem of coupled luttinger liquids .",

    ", electrons on different chains still interact with the three - dimensional coulomb interaction , so that this is not a purely one - dimensional problem .",

    "exponentiating this expression , we see that the interacting green s function satisfies the anomalous scaling relation , @xmath376 in momentum space this implies for @xmath377 and @xmath378 an anomalous scaling law of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomalscale ] ) with @xmath379 .",
    "thus , in spite of the fact that the system is a fermi liquid , there exists for small @xmath227 a parametrically large intermediate regime where the interacting green s function satisfies the anomalous scaling law of luttinger liquids .",
    "moreover , the effective anomalous exponent _ is precisely given by the anomalous dimension of the luttinger liquid that would exist for @xmath313_. this is a very important result , because in realistic experimental systems the interchain hopping @xmath0 can never be completely turned off .",
    "our result implies that for small but finite @xmath227 the anomalous dimension of the luttinger liquid is in principle measurable , although strictly speaking the system is a fermi liquid .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , an alternative way to approach the problem in the limit of weak interchain hopping is by straight or renormalization group aided perturbation theory in @xmath0@xcite .",
    "in contrast to our result using higher dimensional bosonization these methods yield a finite value for the quasi - particle weight only for values of the anomalous dimensions smaller than a critical value .",
    "starting point in the approximation proposed by wen@xcite and elaborated on by others @xcite is to expand the self - energy defined in the usual way by @xmath380 in powers of the hopping .",
    "if one defines @xmath381 and linearizes the dispersion in the direction of the chains near @xmath382 , one obtains for the model where only intrachain electron - electron interactions are taken into account @xmath383 where @xmath384 is the exact interacting single chain propagator . wen@xcite and",
    "later others @xcite then introduce the rather crude approximation to neglect @xmath385 completely .",
    "this is justified by wen by the fact that @xmath385 formally vanishes with a higher power in @xmath0 than the linear term kept . for the system to be a fermi liquid",
    "a zero frequency pole should occur .",
    "this can happen for arbitrarily small hopping only if @xmath386 diverges . using the exact results for the one - dimensional green s function , @xmath387 can in fact be shown to diverge ( for the model without and with spin ) for values of the anomalous dimension @xmath168 . in this case",
    "the quasi - particle weight in this approximation is proportional to @xmath388 , and therefore _ vanishes _ when @xmath11 reaches one .",
    "this result is in agreement with the naive renormalization group argument in which the weak - coupling criterion for the relevance of @xmath0 is used for arbitrary strong coupling .",
    "this behavior of the quasi - particle weight differs from our bosonization result , which yields a finite value also for @xmath389 and larger .",
    "the shape of the fermi surface for @xmath168 in wen s approximation is determined by the equation @xmath390 and yields a modification @xmath391 compared to the flat surface of zero transverse hopping of order @xmath392 , i.e. the _ shape _ of the fermi surface depends on the _ strength _ of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "such a dependence is missing in our bosonization approach .",
    "this is probably the reason for the qualitatively different results for the quasi - particle weight for @xmath393 .",
    "if one calculates the spectral function corresponding to wen s green s function , it shows various properties in the low energy regime which look rather unphysical . if one crosses the fermi surface there are sharp poles even for finite distances away from it on one side , but there is only continuous spectral weight on the other side .",
    "we believe our bosonization result to produce more reliable spectra , at least for @xmath394 . for a direct comparison for our model including electron - electron interchain interaction , it would be necessary to first generalize wen s approximation to this case .",
    "this can be done be replacing @xmath384 in eq.([eq : gwen ] ) by the exact green s function for zero hopping which takes into account the interchain interaction . for this model",
    "the approximation to neglect @xmath385 completely is even more serious , as @xmath385 vanishes with one power in @xmath0 less than in the model with intrachain electron - electron interaction only .",
    "this can be easily shown diagrammatically .",
    "clarke and strong@xcite have argued that even in the range @xmath395 the green s function in wen s approximation contains unphysical non - analyticities which indicate a breakdown of fermi liquid behavior already at @xmath396 .",
    "this seems to fit well to the other results from their concept of `` confined coherence '' .",
    "it will be shown elsewhere@xcite that their arguments concerning the analytical properties of wen s green s function are not well justified .",
    "even if one assumes it to be correct that the fermi surface becomes flat as @xmath11 approaches one ( from below ) , the resulting state of the system can not be a simple luttinger liquid , defined as a non - trivial metallic ground state where different instabilities mutually cancel . using the parquet approach it has recently been shown@xcite that two - dimensional systems with flat regions on opposite sides of the fermi surface always develop some sort of instability towards a phase with spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "in this work we have used the higher - dimensional bosonization approach to study the problem of coupled luttinger liquids .",
    "our main result is that strictly speaking luttinger liquid behavior exists only for @xmath16 .",
    "any finite value of the interchain hopping leads to a finite quasi - particle residue , which we have explicitly calculated .",
    "nevertheless , in a large intermediate regime of wave - vectors and frequencies the green s function exhibits precisely the same scaling behavior as for @xmath16 . keeping in mind that experiments are always performed with finite resolution",
    ", the intermediate scaling regime seems to be the experimentally relevant one  in this sense the interchain hopping is irrelevant .    although our approach is non - perturbative in the sense that an infinite number of feynman diagrams have been summed , it is only approximate .",
    "however , we have a strong non - perturbative argument why all terms beyond the gaussian approximation that have been ignored in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gbosres])([eq : slondef ] ) are negligible in the parameter regime of interest : the closed loop theorem @xcite , which is essentially equivalent with the ward - identity derived by castellani , di castro and metzner @xcite , guarantees a cancellation of the leading infrared singularities in the non - gaussian terms _ to all orders in perturbation theory_. of course , for linearized energy dispersion the shape of the fermi surface is fixed .",
    "therefore , if the renormalization of the shape of the fermi surface by the interaction becomes relevant in the present problem , our conclusions are expected to be modified . however , as discussed in sec.[sec : wenapproximation ] , at least as long as the value of the anomalous dimension without interchain hopping is small compared with unity , we expect the interaction - induced modification of the shape of the fermi surface to be unimportant .",
    "it should also be mentioned that only small momentum transfers have been taken into account in our approach , so that possible instabilities due to @xmath397-processes have been neglected .",
    "thus , although we have for simplicity taken the zero - temperature limit , our results are implicitly restricted to temperatures @xmath14 where the system is in the normal state .",
    "it is easy to see for @xmath398 the expressions for the long - distance behavior of the static debye - waller factor @xmath330 derived above remain correct at distances small with the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath399 . beyond this length scale",
    "we find that @xmath330 is proportional to @xmath400 .",
    "we therefore conclude that for @xmath401 the intermediate scaling regime discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : anomalscale ] exists even at finite temperature .",
