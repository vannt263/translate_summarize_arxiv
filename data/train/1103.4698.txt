    "in the process of investigating the filamentation of a power femtosecond ( fs ) laser pulse many new physical effects have been observed , such as long - range self - channeling @xcite , coherent and incoherent radial and forward thz emission @xcite , asymmetric pulse shaping , super - broad spectra @xcite and others .",
    "the role of the different mechanisms in near zone ( up to @xmath0 @xmath1 from the source ) has been investigated experimentally and by numerical simulations , and most processes in this zone are well explained @xcite . when a fs pulse with power of several @xmath2 starts from the laser source a slice - by - slice self - focussing process takes place @xcite .",
    "at a distance of one - two meters the pulse self - compresses , enlarging the @xmath3 spectrum to super - broad asymmetric spectrum @xmath4 .",
    "the process increases the core intensity up to tens of @xmath5 , where different types of plasma ionization , multi - photon processes and higher - order kerr terms appear @xcite .",
    "usually , the basic model of propagation in near the zone is a scalar spatio - temporal paraxial equation including all the above mentioned mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the basic model is natural in the near zone because of the fact that the initial fs pulse contains a narrow - band spectrum @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the paraxial spatio - temporal model gives a good explanation of nonlinear phenomena such as conical emission , x - waves , spectral broadening to the high frequency region and others . in far - away zone ( propagation distance more than @xmath7 meters )",
    "plasma ionization and higher - order kerr terms are admitted also as necessary for a balance between the self - focussing and plasma defocussing and for obtaining long range self - channeling in gases .    however , the above explanation of filamentation is difficult to apply in far - away zone .",
    "there are basically two main characteristics which remain the same at these distances - the superbroad spectrum and the width of the core , while the intensity in a stable filament drops to a value of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the plasma and higher - order kerr terms are too small to prevent self - focussing .",
    "the observation of long - range self - channeling @xcite without ionization also leads to change the role of plasma in the laser filamentation .",
    "in addition , there are difficulties with the physical interpretation of the thz radiation as a result of plasma generation .",
    "the plasma strings formed during filamentation should emit incoherent thz radiation in a direction orthogonal to the propagation axis .",
    "the nature of the thz emission , measured in @xcite is different . instead of being emitted radially",
    ", it is confined to a very narrow cone in the forward direction .",
    "the contribution from ionization in far - away zone is negligible @xcite and this is the reason to look for other physical mechanism which could cause thz or ghz radiations .",
    "our analysis on the third order nonlinear polarization of pulses with broadband spectrum indicates that the nonlinear term in the corresponding envelope equation oscillates with frequency proportional to the group and phase velocity difference @xmath9 .",
    "actually , this is three times the well - known carrier - to envelope phase ( cep ) difference @xcite .",
    "this oscillation induces thz generation , where the generated frequency is exactly @xmath10 for a pulse with superbroad spectrum @xmath11 with carryier wavelength @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "physically , one dimensional schrdinger solitons in fibers appear as a balance between the kerr nonlinearity and the negative dispersion @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we try to find 2d+1 and spatio - temporal solitons in kerr media , the numerical and the real experiments demonstrate that there is no balance between the plane wave paraxial diffraction - dispersion and the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "this leads to instability and self - focusing of a laser beam or initially narrow band optical pulse .",
    "recently serkin in @xcite suggested stable soliton propagation and reducing the 3d soliton problem to one dimensional , with introducing trapping potential in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "in this paper we present a new mathematical model , on the basis of the amplitude envelope ( ae ) equation , up to second order of dispersion , without using paraxial approximation . in the non - paraxial zone",
    "the diffraction of pulses with superbroad spectrum or pulses with a few cycles under the envelope is closer to wave type @xcite . for such pulses , a new physical mechanism of balance between nonparaxial ( wave - type diffraction ) and third",
    "order nonlinearity appears .",
    "exact analytical three - dimensional bright solitons in this regime are found .",
    "the paraxial spatio - temporal envelope equation governs well the transverse diffraction and the dispersion of fs pulses up to @xmath14 cycles under the envelope .",
    "this equation relies on one approximation obtained after neglecting the second derivative in the propagation direction and the second derivative in time from the wave equation @xcite or from the @xmath15 ae equation @xcite . in air ,",
    "the series of @xmath16 are strongly convergent up to one cycle under the envelope and this is the reason why the ae equation is correct up to the single - cycle regime .",

    "@xmath174 @xmath175 , the constants of both terms in the r.h.s of equation ( [ normwave ] ) are very small ( @xmath176 and @xmath177 ) and can be neglected . thus , equation ( [ normwave ] ) becomes :    @xmath178    furthermore , we shall assume that the new envelope wave equation ( [ cwave ] ) has solutions in the form :    @xmath179    where @xmath180 . from the nonlinear wave equation ( [ cwave ] ) , using ( [ b ] ) , the following ordinary nonlinear equation is obtained :    @xmath181    the number @xmath152 counts for the longitudinal compression and the phase modulation of the pulse . when the nonlinear coefficient is slightly above the critical and reaches the value @xmath182 , equation ( [ rwave ] ) has exact particle - like solution of the form :    @xmath183    using the fact that @xmath184 and @xmath185 , the solution ( [ soliton1 ] ) is simplified to the following algebraic soliton :",
    "@xmath186    the solution ( [ soliton2 ] ) gives the time evolution of our lorentz initial form , investigated in the previous section .",
    "as be seen from equation ( [ cwave ] ) , the solution appears as a balance between the parabolic ( not paraxial ) wave type diffraction of broad band pulse @xmath161 and the nonlinearity of third order .",
    "the maxima of this solution are at the points where @xmath187 .",
    "if we turn back to standard , not normalized coordinates , and solve the second order equation @xmath188 , only one real solution @xmath189 can be obtained .",
    "it corresponds to one - directional propagation with position of the maximum on the @xmath46 - coordinate @xmath189 . as it was pointed above , fig .",
    "8 presents the initial @xmath190 spectrum of the soliton ( [ soliton2 ] ) . while the @xmath191 spectrum is symmetric , the @xmath3 projection is fully asymmetric , enlarging forwards to low @xmath3 wave - numbers ( long wavelengths ) , and has typical lorentz shape .",
    "recently , in experiments with @xmath7 cycle pulses long range filaments with similar spectral profile @xcite are observed .",
    "we suppose that in this experiment a @xmath15 lorentz type soliton was found experimentally for the first time .",
    "in this paper we investigate femtosecond pulse propagation in air , governed by the ae equation , in linear and nonlinear regime .",
    "the equation allows to solve the problem of propagation of pulses with super - broad spectrum .",
    "note that this problem can not be studied in paraxial optics . in linear regime",
    "the fundamental solutions of ae ( [ dde ] ) and de ( [ de ] ) are obtained and different regimes of diffraction are analyzed . the typical fs pulses up to @xmath192 fs diffract by the fresnel law , in a plane orthogonal to the direction of propagation , while their longitudinal shape is preserved in air or is enlarged a little , due to the dispersion .",
    "broad - band pulses ( only a few cycles under envelope ) at several diffraction lengths diffract in a parabolic form .",
    "we solve the convolution problem of the diffraction equation de ( [ de ] ) for an initial pulse in the form of a gaussian bullet , and obtain an exact analytical solution ( [ exact1 ] ) . a new method for solving evolution problems of the wave equation is also suggested .",
    "we investigate precisely the nonlinear third order polarization , including the cep into account .",
    "this additional phase transforms th term to thz or ghz terms , depending on the spectral width of the pulse .",
    "thus , we suggest a new mechanism of thz and ghz generation from fs pulses in nonlinear regime . for pulses with power a little above the critical for self - focusing , we investigate two basic cases : pulses with narrow - band spectrum and with broad - band spectrum . the numerical simulation of the evolution of narrow - band pulses ( standard @xmath65 fs pulses ) , gives a typical conical emission and a spectral enlargement to the short wavelengths .",
    "our study of broad - band pulses leads to the conclusion that their propagation is governed by the nonlinear wave equation with third order nonlinear term ( [ cwave ] ) , when the thz oscillation is neglected as small term .",
    "an exact soliton solution of equation ( [ cwave ] ) , with @xmath15 lorentz shape is also obtained .",
    "the soliton appears as a balance between parabolic divergent type diffraction and parabolic convergent type of nonlinear self - focusing .",
    "numerically , we demonstrate a relative stability of the soliton pulse with respect to the thz oscillations .",
