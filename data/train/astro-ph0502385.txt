    "in recent years , advances in detector efficiency , large ground - based telescopes and space - based observatories such as the _ hubble space telescope ( hst )  _ and _ spitzer space telescope _ , have revolutionized studies of the high redshift universe .",
    "searches based on lyman-@xmath11 emission are now at last uncovering many galaxies at @xmath12 ( e.g. , kodaira et al .  2003 ; rhoads et al .",

    "yet an important part of the puzzle is missing : the @xmath3-band drops are selected in the rest - frame uv , and are therefore known to be actively forming stars .",
    "however , it is unclear whether these objects suffer from significant reddening due to dust ( in which case the star formation rates will have been underestimated ) , or if there is an underlying older stellar population which has been recently rejuvenated .",

    "is related to the average surface brightness _ at _ @xmath88 , @xmath89 , by @xmath90 for a de vaucouleurs profile ( ciotti & bertin 1999 ) .",
    "hence our surface brightness at @xmath88 is @xmath91 .",
    "cosmological surface brightness dimming of @xmath92 would have dimmed _",
    "real _ surface brightnesses by @xmath93mag , and passive evolution from an age of @xmath94myr at @xmath27 to @xmath95gyr at @xmath96 would produce a luminosity dimming of a factor of @xmath97 in @xmath86 ( @xmath98mag , using the b&c models ) .",
    "hence , we might expect sbm03#1&#3 to have surface brightnesses _ today _ of @xmath99 for their half - light radii of @xmath100kpc .",
    "in fact , the passively - evolved surface brightnesses sit comfortably on the present - day kormendy relation ( e.g. , that of ziegler et al .",
    "1999 for cluster ellipticals ) , extrapolated to smaller scale lengths .",
    "hence it seems that the inferred properties of these @xmath2 galaxies are compatible with galaxy scaling relations at @xmath96 , subject to dimming through stellar evolution .",
    "although our analysis has focused on only two of the most luminous systems , chosen by virtue of their luminosity , the possible implications are profound .",
    "what do these @xmath3-drop galaxies at @xmath2 evolve into ?",
    "given that these objects are barely resolved in the _",
    "hst_/acs data with @xmath101kpc , they are unlikely to passively evolve into the ellipticals we see in the present - day universe  these are typically larger . merging would be required to explain the size evolution , although we note that the stellar masses and spatial scales of our @xmath2 galaxies are similar to those of some spiral bulges today : a stellar age of @xmath102gyr ( wyse , gilmore & franz 1997 ) today would imply a formation epoch of @xmath103 .      when conducting the sed fitting , two metallicities",
    "were considered : solar ( @xmath104 ) and a sub - solar model ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the ages and masses of the best - fit models were similar for both metallicities , although the sub - solar model returned slightly better fits to the data , with smaller reduced @xmath106 values .",
    "we also considered whether the red optical - infrared colours ( spanning the rest - frame uv to optical ) could be attributable to dust reddening instead of , or as well as , an underlying old stellar population . to further examine this , we adopt the reddening model of calzetti ( 1997 ) with the wavelength dependence of the reddening expressed as : @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and @xmath109/\\lambda + 1.73\\ ] ] for @xmath110 , and the flux attenuation is given by : @xmath111 ] , appropriate to starburst galaxies .",
    "we constructed a grid of models for both the ssp ( instantaneous burst ) and constant sfr scenarios , using the bruzual & charlot templates over the full range of 221 age steps . for each age , we varied reddening in the range @xmath112mag , in steps of @xmath113mag , computing the reduced @xmath69 at each step .",
    "we find little evidence for substantial dust reddening in the detected starlight out to @xmath114 m : the formal best - fits for both sbm03#1&#3 are no reddening .",
    "this is consistent with the flat spectral slopes in @xmath115 between the acs @xmath13-band and the nicmos @xmath116- and @xmath117-bands reported by stanway , mcmahon & bunker ( 2005 ) for many of the @xmath3-drops in the _ hubble _ ultra deep field , including sbm03#1 .",
    "the brightening in @xmath115 flux between the near - infrared ( @xmath118 m ) and the irac bands at @xmath119 m is best explained by a spectral break rather than the smoother continuum gradient produced by dust reddening , and this is reflected in the best - fit stellar populations .",
    "finally , we tested the effects on the derived stellar masses of the assumed initial mass function . for the galaxy sbm03#1 ( where the multi - waveband data was best ,",
    "as it included nicmos imaging in the near - infrared ) , we re - ran the ` two - population ' model fits ( section  [ sec : age ] ) with a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , instead of a salpeter ( 1955 ) power law imf .",
    "we used the same ongoing 10myr constant star formation rate burst , and fit for the age of an underlying older stellar population and the relative stellar masses of the burst and the old stars .",
    "both imfs produced comparably good fits ( near - identical @xmath69 values ) , the same 450myr ages , and near - identical burst fractions ( 0.6% and 0.7% by mass for the chabrier and salpeter imfs ) .",
    "the main difference came in the best - fitting total stellar mass : the chabrier model produced a mass @xmath120% less than the salpeter imf ( @xmath121 compared with @xmath122 for sbm03#1 ) .",
    "this effect is mainly a mass re - scaling independent of star formation history , as the discrepancy primarily arises from the different mass fraction in long - lived low - mass stars .",
    "we can usefully compare the ongoing star formation rate , the stellar mass and implied age , to deduce whether our two selected @xmath2 galaxies are being seen during a fairly quiet or active period in their history .",
    "first , let us consider the ongoing sfr",
    ". star formation will dominate the rest - frame uv light ( probed by the _",
    "hst_/acs images ) in the absence of dust obscuration or a significant agn contribution . in our first analyses of @xmath3-drop galaxies in the goods acs images ( stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; stanway et al .",
    "2004a ) and the ultra deep field ( bunker et al .  2004 ) , we used the conversion from rest - frame uv flux density to sfr , given by madau , pozzetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) , appropriate for continuous star formation .",
    "based on the @xmath13-band magnitudes we inferred unobscured sfrs of @xmath123&@xmath124 for sbm03#1&#3 , after accounting for lyman forest blanketting of @xmath125 shortwards of lyman-@xmath11 .",
    "the fits of the bruzual & charlot stellar synthesis models to the broad - band photometry provide estimates of the current sfr for a range of histories ( tables[tab : sbm03_1_solar],[tab : sbm03_1_subsolar],[tab : sbm03_3_solar],[tab : sbm03_3_subsolar]&[tab : tau ] ) .",
    "however , a firm lower limit arises from our keck / deimos spectroscopy ( bunker et al .",
    "2003 , stanway et al .",
    "2004a ) , which revealed lyman-@xmath11 emission .",
    "if this line emission is powered by ionizing photons from ob stars , then there must be star formation activity in these galaxies within the past 10myr ( the lifetime of these stars , which dominate the lyman continuum flux ) .",
    "we have argued previously that the absence of x - ray emission and high - ionization lines such as nv1240 , coupled with the narrow velocity width of the lyman-@xmath11 emission , renders an agn interpretation unlikely .",
    "our spectroscopy of sbm03#1&#3 indicates line fluxes of @xmath126 for both sources , with rest - frame equivalent widths of @xmath127 . assuming case  b recombination and the same salpeter imf as in the bruzual & charlot models , the star formation rates from lyman-@xmath11 are @xmath128",
    "this may be treated as a firm _ lower limit _ on the current sfr , as the resonantly - scattered lyman-@xmath11 line is invariably quenched by dust to well below its case  b line strength .",
    "our spectroscopic lower limit of an @xmath129 rules out the simple ssp model and those declining star formation rate models with the shortest decay times ( @xmath130myr , figure  [ fig : massplotsbm03_1 ] ) .",
    "our favoured models are an exponentially decaying sfr with decay time @xmath131myr , and two - component models with @xmath132% of the stellar mass created in an ongoing starburst which began @xmath133myr prior to the epoch of observation .",
    "these all indicate similar sfrs to our original estimates of @xmath134 from the @xmath13-band flux .    returning to the ratio of the current sfr to the stellar mass already formed , it is helpful to consider the ` @xmath135-parameter ' ( e.g. , brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 )  a measure of the fraction of the total stellar mass currently being born as stars , defined as @xmath136 .",

    "2004 ) , and an indication of vigorous current star formation which supports the conclusion of this paper .",
    "however , the past - average sfr must actually be _",
    "greater _ than the current sfr in order to build our @xmath139 galaxies , given the short time available prior to @xmath2 ( 1gyr ) .",

    "this is the case for both sbm03#1&3 for the best - fitting models .",
    "indeed , to form the @xmath144 of stars requires an average star formation rate of @xmath145 over the redshift range @xmath146 favoured for the formation of the old stellar component ( section  [ sec : age ] ) .",
