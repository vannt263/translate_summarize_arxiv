    "the interaction between bosons plays an essential role due to the strong constraint in phase space in 1d case .",
    "@xcite have shown that a trapped quasi - one - dimensional system of interacting bosons under the experimental conditions can be described by a luttinger liquid ( ll ) hamiltonian . as is known that the low - energy physics of 1d single channel conductors can not be described by the fermi liquid theory if the particle - particle interactions are taken into account @xcite .",
