    "low - frequency observations are very important for the study of the statistical signatures of extragalactic sources , in particular source counts in the low - frequency sky , which until recently have been only characterized at the very highest end of the flux scale .",
    "the number of steep - spectrum sources increases rapidly as the sample selection frequency is lowered @xcite , because these sources become too faint to be detected at high frequencies leading to an expectation that low - frequency sky surveys will uncover this population in greater numbers than current cm - wavelength studies . as it is not trivial to infer the low - frequency ( @xmath5 300 mhz ) sky from higher frequency data , deep source counts at the same frequency as eor observations are required for accurate foreground modeling and subtraction .",
    "better understanding of the statistical properties and behavior of radio sources is required and motivated by a number of science goals , such as the foreground modeling and subtraction in the detection of the eor .    over the last 30 years",
    ", a large and ever increasing number of surveys and targeted observations have been performed at low frequencies commencing with the 6th cambridge ( 6c ) survey of radio sources @xcite , which covered the entire northern sky above 30 degrees at 151 mhz . since then a number of other surveys have been completed such as the 7th and 8th cambridge survey of radio sources ( 7c , and 8c : @xcite ) , the targeted survey on the culgoora circular array @xcite in which the flux densities of 1800 high - frequency - selected radio sources were measured at 80 and 160 mhz , the 74 mhz vla low - frequency sky survey ( vlss : @xcite ) above -30 degrees , the murchison widefield array commissioning survey ( mwacs : @xcite ) covering 6,100 @xmath6 between 104 and 196 mhz , and the precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper ; @xcite ) low resolution survey of the southern sky at 145 mhz .",
    "current low frequency radio interferometers , such as lofar @xcite , gmrt @xcite , lwa @xcite , mwa @xcite and paper @xcite have made a considerable advance in our understanding of the population of extragalactic radio sources at frequencies below 300 mhz with all - sky low frequency surveys(@xcite ) .",
    "the upcoming square kilometre array ( ska ) is expected to continue to push the boundaries of low - frequency astronomy , observing the radio sky at much higher sensitivity and resolution .",
    "recently , @xcite determined the 154mhz source counts with mwa observation of the so - called eor0 field ( which is centered at j2000 @xmath7 ) and compared these with the 7c counts at 151mhz @xcite , as well as the gmrt source counts at 153mhz @xcite finding good agreement to a limiting flux density of @xmath840 mjy . using lofar , @xcite examined source counts at 34 , 46 and 62 mhz , a wavelength regime not explored since the 8c observations at 38 mhz 25 years earlier .",
    "the lofar observations are the deepest images ever obtained at these frequencies and reach noise levels of the order of a few mjy , being nearly 2 orders of magnitude deeper than the 8c survey . @xcite",
    "confirmed the previously known result that the average spectral index of radio galaxies flattens towards lower frequencies , as is expected from synchrotron losses @xcite .",
    "in addition to understanding the properties of the low frequency radio population to study the population itself , it is of great importance to properly characterize the population if we are to fully exploit these instruments to detect the eor as a precise sky model is vital for subtracting foreground sources @xcite .",
    "thus , source count studies of the low frequency sky are strongly motivated by a number of complementary science goals .",
    "the north celestial pole ( ncp ) region is covered at low - frequencies by the wsrt @xcite and lofar @xcite , it is also the sky region targeted by the 21 centimeter array ( 21cma ) . the key science goal for the 21cma is to statistically measure the redshifted 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the eor . determining the radio source counts and understanding the spectral properties of the radio sources are important for removing the foreground sources and extracting the faint eor signal . in this paper , we present targeted observations centered on the ncp and extending 5 degrees in radius using the 21cma . we determine the source counts using eight sub - band images between 75 mhz and 175 mhz with flux densities down to @xmath9 jy .",
    "we also investigate the spectral properties of catalog sources and compare our source counts with the recent surveys .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the 21cma telescope , the observation and data reduction pipeline .",
    "section 3 presents the source extraction process and resultant source catalog and properties including number counts , spectral indices , completeness and errors .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "the 21cma is a ground based radio interferometer dedicated to detection of the eor .",
    "the array , sited in the ulastai valley of western china , consists of 81 pods or stations , with a total of 10287 log - periodic antennas are deployed in two perpendicular arms along an east - west ( 6.1 km ) ( figure [ fig : baseline ] ) and north - south ( 4 km ) direction , respectively .",
    "spacing of these 81 pods is chosen such that a sufficiently large number of redundant baselines and a good uniform uv coverage can both be guaranteed .",
    "each antenna element has 16 pairs of dipoles with lengths varying from 0.242 m to 0.829 m , optimized to cover a frequency range of 50 - 200 mhz , which gives rise to an angular resolution of @xmath10 at 200 mhz .",
    "all the antennas are fixed on the ground and point at the ncp for the sake of simplicity and economy , which allows us to observe the same patch of sky for 24 hours a day through the whole year .",
    "therefore , we can reach a higher sensitivity in a region of a few ten square degrees around the ncp in a relatively short time .",
    "phase delayed coaxial cables are used to combine the signal from each antenna for each pod , and the output signal is digitized at a sampling rate of 400 mhz with 8 bit precision to accommodate the bandwidth of 200 mhz , although signal below 50 mhz is actually filtered out .",
    "fast fourier transforms ( fft ) and correlations are performed in software by a cluster of 83 , dual - core intel(r ) xeon(tm ) servers , equipped with gigabit ethernet networks ( pci - e 10-gbps 4x ) and a high speed network ( infiniband ) switch ( cisco sfs-7008p ) . the 200 mhz bandwidth",
    "is divided into 8192 channels , giving rise to a frequency resolution of 24.4 khz .",
    "data in each channel are integrated for about 3 seconds in memory before they are output to a disk array of 32 terabytes .",
    "hard disks are transported to the headquarters of the national astronomical observatories of china in beijing for analysis .",
    "[ fig : baseline ]    construction of the 21cma was completed in 2006 , and a significant upgrade was made in 2009 by installing a new type of low noise amplifier ( 40 k ) on each antenna and 40 sets of gpus in a new data acquisition cluster .",
    "the former considerably suppresses thermal noise from the phased delayed cables , while the later provides a very efficient way to speed up correlation computation processing .",
    "we have used software instead of hardware or fpgas to perform the fft and correlations .",
    "after this upgrade we also decided to run the e - w baseline only to maintain a higher efficiency ( @xmath11 ) of data acquisition by reducing the computing demands for cross - correlations . furthermore , this allows us to work with a relatively simple interferometric imaging algorithm without the concern of the so - called `` w '' term .    in the early commissioning observations between 2005 - 2009",
    ", many efforts were made to understand the performance of the 21cma system including antennas , receivers , data acquisition process , and even the power supply .",
    "we have developed all software packages and techniques such as identification and mitigation of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , calibration , deconvolution , wide - field imaging , etc .",
    "necessary for full data processing of 21cma data . since july of 2010 after its upgrade , the 21cma has routinely observed the low frequency sky round the ncp , delivering about 2 terabits of visibility data per day for offline analysis .",
    "while the primary goal of the 21cma is to accumulate a deep observation for eor detection , even with relatively short integrations we can characterize the extra - galactic source population .",
    "on one hand , these bright extragalactic sources , a byproduct of our eor experiment , can be of great interest for exploration of their astrophysical properties .",
    "on the other hand , these radio sources constitute one of the major contamination components for our eor detection , and therefore should be perfectly imaged and subsequently subtracted . in the current work we present the point radio sources observed with the 40 pods of the 21cma e - w baselines for an integration of 12 hours made on 2013 april 13 .",
    "an extra deep sample with a higher sensitivity from a longer integration time of up to years will be published later .",
    "although the radio environment of the 21cma site , ulastai , is exceptionally quiet at low frequency and comparable to sites such as the murchison radio observatory ( @xcite ) , rfi is still a prominent concern for doing the eor experiment .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] displays the average spectrum of cross - correlation between two pods over 12 hours with a frequency resolution of @xmath12 khz , which reveals the rfi at the site more clearly than the self - correlation of the same pod because thermal noises from different pods are not correlated .",
    "the overall shape reflects the decreasing sky noise at high frequencies and the decreasing efficiency of the antennas at low frequencies with a turnover at roughly 85 mhz .",
    "the strongest rfi sources are identified as low orbiting satellites at 137 mhz , local train communications at 150 mhz , civil aviation aircraft around 130 mhz and at 119 mhz , fm radio broadcasting at 88 - 108 mhz scattered by meteor tails and aircraft , and am radio broadcasting around 70 mhz , and several other contaminators @xcite .",
    "all these sources of rfi are highly time variable , and can be easily flagged for blanking during the editing process .",
    "after the mitigation of strong , time variable rfi , we apply a second statistical algorithm for further removal of other possible rfi using the fact that the sampling of visibilities should exhibit a gaussian distribution for a given frequency , a scheme often adopted in data analysis of recent low frequency experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the second stage of rfi mitigation we excluded all the data points beyond @xmath13 deviation from gaussian statistics .",
    "this operation is applied to the real and imaginary parts separately , and the visibility data are edited out if either of the parts fail to reach the @xmath13 restrictions .",
    "this still allows us to use the bulk ( about 97% ) of the data except for some of the most noisy channels around 137 mhz and 150 mhz .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detail description of our rfi identification and mitigation processing .",
    "low - frequency radio interferometric observations are often affected by ionospheric turbulence , resulting in fluctuations of both source positions and flux densities .",
    "we run two algorithms to correct the phase error in the visibilities due primarily to ionospheric effects : self - calibration and the closure relation .",
    "software developed in - house is used for self - calibration , in which a time interval of 1 hour is used for the present study .",
    "we have tested shorter intervals of down to 10 minutes , and found that the changes are only minor when longer baselines of @xmath14 m are excluded ( see below ) .",
    "we have already improved our self - calibration algorithm by combining conventional self - calibration and redundant calibration , we will apply it for all baselines using a short time interval in the future data reduction ( zheng et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the ncp sky at 50 - 200 mhz is actually dominated by two bright sources : a central bright quasar ( nvss j011732 + 892848 ) and a galaxy 3c61.1 .",
    "3c61.1 is a very bright giant galaxy with a flux density of 33 jy at 150 mhz , which also shows a complex structure .",
    "we select 10 radio sources including these two bright sources ( table [ table : calibrators ] ) to correct the phase errors with self - calibration . following this",

    "we perform a fast fourier transform of the uv map using a uniform weighting with @xmath17 grids , sampled by different baselines and snapshots for each frequency channel , to generate the dirty maps .",
    "this yields a total of 6144 images over 50 - 200 mhz frequency bands with a frequency resolution of 24.4 khz .",
    "then , each dirty image is deconvolved using the conventional hgbom clean algorithm @xcite with a loop - gain of 0.05 .",
    "we terminate the clean process when the fractional change in the total cleaned flux density is less than @xmath18 in the iteration .",
    "employment of a smaller threshold does not alter the result significantly .",
    "after the deconvolution we adopt a larger frequency bin of 1.56 mhz to combine the 6144 images into 96 mosaics , and concentrate on only the central field of view of @xmath19 pixels , corresponding to a @xmath20 degree square area .",
    "note that this gives rise to an angular resolution of @xmath21 arcmin per pixel while the best resolution of the array is only @xmath22 arcmin at 200 mhz .",
    "directivity and gain of the 21cma antenna element , the log - periodic antenna , has been precisely measured in laboratory , which indeed allows us to compute the primary beam and gain of the 21cma pod according to the pattern multiplication theorem .",
    "however , in situ calibration has to be made to account for the possible effect of crosstalk between the antennas themselves and the antennas and the ground . for a 12 hour ( or more ) observation of the 21cma centered on the ncp",
    ", the primary beam of a pod has circular symmetry .",
    "moreover , in terms of our laboratory measurement of the spatial response of the 21cma log - periodic antenna and theoretical prediction based on the pattern multiplication theorem , the primary beam pattern of a 21cma pod is nicely approximated by a gaussian profile characterized by the standard deviation @xmath23 .",
    "guided by our knowledge and experience , we adopt a modulated gaussian function parametrized by @xmath24 for the primary beam and gain of the 21cma pod , where g is the system gain which varies with frequency @xmath25 , @xmath26 measures the radial distance from the ncp , @xmath27 denotes the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution , and a and b are the coefficients in the polynomial of degree 2 .",
    "unfortunately , there are no standard radio sources in the ncp region that can be used for calibration purposes .",
    "thus we use the same sources selected in the self - calibration ( table [ table : calibrators ] ) as our flux calibrators .",
    "we collect the flux density measurements of these sources made at different frequencies ranging from a few ten mhz to a few ghz from the literature and obtain the spectral index , @xmath28 , for each source by fitting the observed flux densities to a power law , @xmath29 . except for the flat - spectrum sources , the fitting errors in amplitude @xmath30 and spectral index @xmath28 are typically @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "errors in these calibrators will be included in fitting of gain and spatial response function of the telescope .",
    "we then use the total flux density within a frequency bin of 1.56 mhz to accommodate our cleaned images over the same frequency band",
    ". however , the primary beam is frequency - dependent , and varies roughly as an exponential profile characterized by @xmath27 for the 21cma .",
    "this reduces further the number of the bright radio sources that can be used for calibration in the higher frequency bands . as a result",
    ", only the inner 4 sources within @xmath33 can be used for the 32 higher frequency bands with @xmath34 mhz , for which uncertainties in the determination of gain and spatial response might be large .",
    "we start with a gaussian profile of @xmath35 , and find the best - fit parameters @xmath36 and @xmath27 in each frequency channel . by fixing @xmath36 and @xmath27",
    ", we then use the same calibrators to find the modification parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 to the gaussian distribution .",
    "it turns out that the gaussian profile provides rather a good description for the 12-hour averaged primary beam , and the modification parameters a and b are actually around zero ( see figures [ fig : theta ] and [ fig : poly ] ) .",
    "moreover , the best - fit gaussian beam of @xmath39 is in good agreement with our theoretical prediction .",
    "figure [ fig : g ] shows the resultant system gain against frequency .",
    "the design of the 21cma antenna is such that the effective area remains roughly constant over a wide frequency range , which yields a frequency dependent gain of @xmath40 .",
    "the steeper profile of the fitted gain factor also reflects the compensation for signal attenuation of the phased - delayed coaxial cable used for signal combination .",

    ", we will not use the data at the two frequency ends , 50 - 75 mhz and 175 - 200 mhz , in the present paper .",

    "it appears that the ratio of @xmath45 reaches a value of @xmath46 and shows an increase trend with frequency .",
    "such a variation is simply the combined effect of the system sensitivity , which is dominated by the milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath47 , and the power - law behavior of the background radio source flux density , @xmath48 with @xmath49 . as a consequence ,",

    "this combined image will be used to remove spurious sources ( see below ) .",

    "the field of view ( fov ) depends on the observing frequency , such that fov@xmath52 . as a result",
    ", we can only extract full spectral information for radio sources within a radius of @xmath53 around the ncp .",
    "nonetheless , we also count the sources between @xmath54 to expand our radio source catalog , for which spectral measurements are based on only the four lower frequency channels , 81.25 , 93.75 , 106.25 and 118.75 mhz .",
    "we note that , many more sources have been found beyond @xmath55 at the lower frequency end , but we will not include them in the present catalog .",
    "source candidates are first selected in the full - band image covering 75 - 175 mhz , using a method similar to duchamp @xcite , in which a threshold of @xmath13 is adopted to identify source candidates .",

    "this allows us to identify and thus remove all the spurious sources that result from the sidelobes of the brightest radio source , 3c061.1 ( see figure [ fig : dirtymap ] and figure [ fig : wideband ] ) .",
    "indeed , we are still unable to perfectly clean the sidelobes of the brightest radio galaxy , 3c061.1 , located at @xmath56 degrees from ncp . the complex structure of this source @xcite is marginally resolved with 21cma .",
    "even with a better angular resolution and a multi - directional calibration using sagecal @xcite , lofar imaging of the same source also contains significant errors @xcite .",
    "our current experiment towards the detection of the eor is thus largely limited by the presence of this very bright , complex radio galaxy in the ncp field .",
    "a gaussian profile is used to fit the `` surface brightness '' of a radio source in each of the sub - bands and the corresponding flux density can be computed straightforwardly .",
    "when two sources show an overlap due to poor resolutions , a two - component gaussian profile is adopted to fit the images simultaneously . yet , even this double gaussian models may fail to fit two sources with significant overlap especially at low frequencies . in this case , we will not provide the flux density information for the two sources but still treat them as separate sources . we calculate the spectral index for each source using the measured flux densities in all the available bands , up to 8 bands for sources within @xmath57 and up to 4 bands for the ones in the annulus of @xmath54 .",

    "however , the fainter sources below our threshold at least in one of the eight sub - bands can not be included with the current criterion of source selection .",
    "in addition , the threshold varies with frequency channels , and therefore , we may have missed a significant fraction of faint sources .",
    "we have thus tested two other methods by relaxing the above criterion for source selection .",
    "the first is to work with an extreme case : all the candidates with peak fluxes above @xmath13 in any sub - band are selected .",
    "this provides an overestimate of source population because image artifacts , due to imperfect cleaning of sidelobes of bright sources , especially 3c061.1 , have contaminated our observing field .",
    "we demonstrate in section 3.3 an example of the completeness estimate from such a source selection method for the highest angular resolution sub - band at 168.75 mhz .",
    "it turns out that the contamination of spurious sources is indeed very serious .",
    "the second test is to select sources based on adjacent frequency channels instead of full bands . to deal with the sidelobes from the bright sources ,",
    "source candidates should be removed from the list once their counterparts are missing only in one of the adjacent channels , using the frequency - dependence properties of sidelobes ( figure [ fig : sourceselection ] ) .",
    "this allows us to identify more faint sources yet leaves the following two drawbacks : ( 1 ) the position variations of the sidelobes - induced `` sources '' become indistinguishable at low frequencies because of poor angular resolution , and ( 2 ) the spectral index can not be estimated reliably if a source shows up only in two frequency bands .",

    "of the 624 sources , 322 sources lie between 3 and 5 deg from the field center ncp which are selected using the four lower frequency subbands ( 81.25 , 93.75 , 106.25 and 118.75 mhz ) .",
    "an immediate cross - check with the existing the 6c catalog at 151 mhz reveals 490 counterparts .",
    "the missing sources are the fainter ones below the detection limit of 0.1 jy in the 6c survey .",
    "namely , about 134 new sources are detected around and below 0.1 jy at 151 mhz .",
    "figure [ fig:21cma-6c ] compares the flux densities of these 490 sources at 151 mhz listed in both 6c catalog and our new catalog , and two measurements above 0.1 jy show rather a good agreement .",
    "[ fig:21cma-6c ]      figure [ fig : alpha1 ] illustrates the histogram of the spectral indices of the 624 sources presented here .",
    "while the distribution peaks at approximately @xmath49 , consistent with what is expected for the overall population of cosmic radio sources , the asymmetrical behavior indicates that more sources tend to have a steeper spectral index .",
    "this could arise as the radio sources with steeper indices are more easily detected at low frequencies .",
    "in other words , low - frequency observations would probably miss some of the flat - spectrum sources if they are not bright enough .",
    "yet , recent observations have argued a spectral flattening towards both lower frequencies and fluxes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to investigate",
    "if similar behavior is evident in our radio source catalog , we restrict the sources within 3 degrees and compare in figure [ fig : alpha2 ] the spectral indices between the 4 lower frequency subbands and the 4 higher frequency subbands .",
    "it turns out that there is a significant excess of steep - spectrum sources in the higher frequency subbands .",
    "this can be further quantified by considering the means , medians and their ratios ( means / medians ) of the two distributions , yielding ( -1.25,-1.15,1.09 ) and ( -0.86,-0.87,0.99 ) for the higher and lower frequency subbands , respectively .",
    "we have also compared the low - frequency sources in the inner radius of 3 degrees and the ones in the outer annulus of @xmath54 , and found that their spectral indices are essentially similar ( figure [ fig : alpha3 ] ) .",
    "while the absence of bias in spectral index between the sources within the central region ( @xmath137 ) and the ones in the outer region ( @xmath54 ) simply reflects the uniformity of cosmic radio sources , it also indicates that our beam model is correct .",
    "it turns out that our analysis does support a flattening trend toward lower frequencies .",
    "if confirmed , this may add a further difficulty for low - frequency observations to detect faint , flat - spectrum sources .",
    "[ fig : alpha1 ]    [ fig : alpha2 ]    [ fig : alpha3 ]      before we perform monte - carlo simulations to estimate the completeness of our source selections , we compare our source counts with the deep low - frequency observations of the noao botes field down to 6 mjy made with gmrt at 153 mhz @xcite .",
    "this allows us to make a quick yet rough judgment on the incompleteness of our source counts at different fluxes .",
    "of course , an extrapolation based on a spectral index conversion should be made for source counts at other frequencies for the `` control '' field .",
    "we notice that the reliability of such an extrapolation is probably questionable , as argued recently by @xcite . taking the differential source count by @xcite at 153 mhz , @xmath138",
    ", we calculate the ratios of our observed sources @xmath139 to what are expected in terms of this single power law , and plot the results for the 168.75 mhz frequency channel in figure [ fraction-3methods ] .",
    "it appears that the incompleteness for our standard method of source selection occurs around 0.1 jy , where the ratio drops to @xmath140 .",
    "namely , a significant fraction of the fainter sources may be missed below 0.1 jy when sources are required to be visible in all subbands to guarantee that the artificial sources from sidelobes be clearly discriminated and perfectly removed .",
    "we have also shown the completeness estimates for the other two selection methods : the extreme approach that treats all the peaks above @xmath13 as `` sources '' gives rise to an apparent over - estimate of true sources even down to @xmath141 jy , indicating that the contamination is rather significant .",
    "sources that are selected in terms of their locations at adjacent frequency channels seem to be complete until @xmath1 jy , and their completeness drops to @xmath142 at 0.01 jy .",
    "while the latter provides a `` better '' completeness of source selection , the poor angular resolution at lower frequencies may be inefficient for discrimination of position shifts of the artificial sources due to sidelobes , as was pointed out above .",
    "we now perform a monte - carlo simulation to quantify the completeness of the source sample .",
    "we generate 20 fields with a radius of @xmath57 , each of which contains 1600 point sources with positions randomly distributed .",
    "the fluxes of these artificial sources are assumed to follow a power - law of @xmath143 and are further restricted within @xmath144 mjy @xmath145 jy , for which a spectral index of @xmath146 is assumed .",
    "we include the beam smearing effect by convolving the image with a gaussian function characterized by the true beam at each frequency band .",
    "we add noise to the simulated map at each channel using the true residual map from our deconvolution after point sources are peeled out .",
    "furthermore , the radial variation in sensitivity around the ncp is taken into account by the spatial response of the telescope described by eq.(2 ) .",
    "now , we adopt the same mechanism , the so - called standard method , to extract sources at the same eight frequency channels , using the image flux and position information over the frequency bands . figure [ fraction ] shows the mean fraction of simulated sources recovered against total flux density for each of the eight channels , respectively , in which the error bars represent the standard statistical deviations .",
    "as expected , the turning points of completeness exhibit a weak increasing tread towards higher frequencies .",
    "unfortunately , the completeness decreases rapidly to zero beyond @xmath147 jy , although we can still detect some sources down to @xmath148 jy for all the 8 frequency bands .",

    "for the 21cma field , the two brightest radio sources , cas a and cygnus a , are visible on the sky map of @xmath183 ( @xcite ) , and their grating lobes have already entered into the central ncp field at certain frequencies . at present the imaging",
    "has not included and corrected the sidelobes from these two sources , although they have already contributed to the deconvolution noise .    in summary",
    ", it appears that with time integration the thermal noise dominated by the milky way can be well controlled to below the confusion noise in current low - frequency interferometric imaging .",
    "however , to beat down the confusion noise , one needs to deal with not only the unresolved , faint radio sources , but also the calibration and deconvolution errors .",
    "in particular , calibration errors from both ionospheric effects and bright , extended sources are difficult to handle at present .",
    "these errors can propagate to the deconvolution processing and affect the lower threshold of identifying the faint radio sources through @xmath176 . as a result , the conventional confusion limit , which is determined by unresolved sources and synthesized beam , is actually affected by the extension of accuracy and reliability of calibration and deconvolution .",
    "in fact , the major source of errors in our current imaging arises from the calibration and deconvolution processing .",
    "the former is related to both ionospheric effects and modeling of extended , bright radio sources in the field , and the latter is involved with the removals of grating lobes and sidelobes of strong radio sources , both within and outside of the field .     and @xmath13 noise levels , respectively , measured at eight sub - bands over the ncp field .",
    "the black dashed line represents the theoretically estimated confusion limit due to the unresolved fainter sources below @xmath176 , for which we have taken @xmath180 . ,",
    "width=302 ]    [ fig : confusion ]",
    "we have analyzed 12 hours of data taken from the 21cma observations centered on the ncp . to reduce the complexity of interferometric image processing and the influence of ionospheric perturbation",
    ", we have used all 40 pods along the east - west arm but restricted our analysis to within a maximum baseline of 1500 m. we have calibrated the gain and primary beam of our telescope using the bright radio sources in the ncp field . following conventional self - calibration and deconvolution methods ,",
    "we have detected a total of 624 radio sources over the central field within @xmath57 in frequency range of 75 - 175 mhz and the outer annulus of @xmath54 in the 75 - 125 mhz bands . by performing a monte - carlo simulation",
    "we have estimated a completeness of @xmath11 at @xmath184 jy .",
    "we have compared our source counts with the deep low - frequency observations made recently with gmrt and mwa , and the completeness - corrected source counts show a good agreement with these recent surveys at the corresponding frequency bands .",
    "while we are able to detect the fainter sources down to 10 mjy , the detection fraction has dropped to @xmath31 , making a ultra deep observation rather difficult and even impossible with current imaging algorithms .",
    "this is primarily caused by errors in sidelobes , calibration , and deconvolution as well as the confusion limit of the array .",
    "spacings between the 21cma pods are the integral multiples of 20 m. the original design of such configuration is for the purpose of redundant calibration and statistical measurement of the eor power spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , this layout also generates the grating lobes evident in our images ( @xcite ) . these equally spaced rings around the bright sources in the field have their brightness almost comparable to the central sources , and therefore should be accurately removed in the deconvolution processing",
    "otherwise , their residuals may be the major sources of contaminations for our imaging .",
    "indeed , our image quality is largely limited by the presence of imperfectly subtracted grating lobes of the brightest source in the ncp field , 3c061.1 .",
    "although this arises partially from the inaccurate calibration , the main reason is the poor modeling of 3c061.1 in our self - calibration processing .",
    "3c061.1 is marginally resolved with 21cma , and its modeling should take the structured components with different surface brightness and spectral index into account ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our next step is to improve our sky model by using a sophisticated model for 3c061.1 and even for very bright , far field sources such as cas a and cygnus a. finally , the theoretically expected thermal noise ( @xmath3 mjy ) is well below the confusion limit due to the unresolved , fainter sources , indicating that the dominated factor of influencing the sensitivity for low - frequency interferometric imaging is no longer the system noise but the cosmic sources in the sky .    several methods to improve our imaging algorithm including an accurate calibration ( e.g. sky modeling and redundant calibration ) , application of the w - term correction , and `` peeling '' sources @xcite are currently under investigation , with our ultimate goal towards detecting the eor power spectrum .",
    "our experience with the 21cma operation and data analysis may provide a useful guide to the design of next generation low - frequency radio array such as the ska .",
    "indeed , employment of numerous redundant baselines helps to improve the precision of calibration .",
    "however , it brings about very prominent grating lobes from bright sources both in - beam and in the far - field .",
    "this not only requires a more careful and accurate calibration of visibilities but also adds an extra difficulty to deconvolution processing .",
    "in particular , the grating lobes of the bright , structured sources like giant radio galaxies with jets are hard to model and thus subtract . in this sense , both random antenna element and station layouts should preferentially be chosen for low - frequency radio interferometers to suppress the grating lobes and sidelobes of bright sources .",
    "we note that an extensive study on this topic has recently been carried out by @xcite .    to summarize , with current layout of the 21cma and conventional imaging algorithm",
    ", we have reached a sensitivity of a few mjy and a dynamical range of @xmath185 .",
    "we may have to improve our imaging quality by an order of magnitude in order to see statistically the eor signature .",
