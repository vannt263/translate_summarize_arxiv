    "very high energy blazars belong to the the class of objects referred to as radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and are characterised by non - thermal continuum spectrum , optical polarisation , flat radio spectrum and strong variability in all frequency bands .",
    "their broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which extends from radio up to the tev range , consists typically of two broad peaks @xcite .",
    "the low energy one peaks in the 0.1 - 100 kev domain and is commonly attributed to synchrotron emission from ultra - relativistic leptons in the jet .",
    "the second component which is , relative to the synchrotron emission , at high frequency is considered to be due to the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering by the leptons of either synchrotron photons ( synchrotron - self - compton process ssc ) @xcite , or external compton ( ec)@xcite .",
    "alternative processes which are generally considered responsible for the second peak are ` hadronic ' processes , which include interactions of a highly - relativistic jet outflow with ambient matter @xcite , proton - induced cascades @xcite and synchrotron radiation due to protons @xcite .",
    "emission of tev photons provides evidence for the presence of particles at roughly the same energy if we assume ic radiation in the klein - nishina regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , it requires an extremely efficient particle acceleration mechanism at work in the close environment of the super massive black hole which forms the central engine of the agn .",
    "1es2344 + 514 or qso b2344 + 514 is a bl lac type object ( z @xmath7   0.044 , l , b @xmath7112.89@xmath8 , -9.91@xmath8 ) which has been the target of many studies . in the vhe @xmath5-ray window",
    ", it was discovered by the whipple collaboration in 1995 @xcite , wherein the evidence for emission came mostly from an apparent flare on december 20 , 1995 and was subsequently confirmed independently by the hegra collaboration @xcite .",
    "tev spectra derived by the whipple group during the flaring state of the source in 1995 @xcite are steeper than for the brightest flare of mrk421 and mrk501 , both located at about 66@xmath9 distance of 1es2344 + 514 .",
    "the magic collaboration have reported vhe @xmath5-ray signal in the energy range 140 gev - 5.4 tev during the period august 3 , 2005 - january 1 , 2006 and found that the source was in a low state @xcite .",
    "the differential spectra obtained by them shows a steeper photon spectrum and six times lower flux level as compared to the 1995 flaring state . at x - ray energies ( 0.2 - 4 kev )",
    "it was detected by the einstein slew survey @xcite .",
    "the source has also shown a rapid x - ray variability feature on a time scale of few hours during a week - long campaign in december 1996 using beppo__sax _ _ satellite in the 0.1 - 10 kev energy band when the source was in a high state @xcite .",
    "in addition , a large decrease of 0.35 magnitude had been observed in the v band during 3 - 17 january 2001 @xcite indicating an optical variability .",
    "tev blazars are now known to undergo flaring episodes both at x - ray and tev @xmath5-ray energies and the emissions are generally correlated albeit the correlation appears to be fairly loose @xcite . by following the spectral evolution it is possible to test the models that predict simultaneous flux changes in different parts of the spectrum , such as in the ssc model , where the x - ray and tev regions are expected to show correlated variations .",
    "further , these objects are characterised by variability features including short , medium and long terms variations and the cross correlation of such features in different wavelength bands may yield new physics of these most violent objects .",
    "a strong correlation between gev @xmath5-ray and near infrared luminosities has been reported earlier@xcite and it has been suggested that it may be a common property of blazars .    in this communication , we present tev and near infrared results on 1es2344 + 514 obtained during our 2004 - 05 observations with tactic ( tev atmospheric cherenkov telescope with imaging camera ) gamma - ray and miro ( mount abu infrared observatory ) telescopes respectively .",
    "in addition , rxte asm@xcite x - ray data ( 2 - 12kev ) of the contemporary period have also been used to study the source behaviour in three energy regimes . in the following sections we describe the results of these observations , including the data analysis procedure and follow it up by a discussion and the main conclusions drawn from this study .",
    ".observation log for 1es2344 + 514 ( on source data ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the mount abu infrared observatory is located at gurushikar , a few kms away from the tactic @xmath5-ray telescope , at an altitude of 1680 m .",
    "it houses a 1.2 m f/13 cassegrain focus infrared telescope @xcite .",
    "the observations in near infrared j and h bands were taken during : ( 1 ) november 18 , 22,23,24 and december 5 , 6 in 2004 and ( 2 ) october 26,27 and december 6 , 10,11 in 2005 , using back end instrument nicmos-3 near infrared detector array camera mounted on the 1.2 m ir telescope .",
    "nicmos-3 is a 256x256 pixels hgcdte array detector , giving a fov of @xmath10 with a pixel resolution of 0.96 arc sec .",
    "the detector is liquid nitrogen cooled to keep dark current low . in the near infrared region",
    "the background is very high leading to detector saturation at longer exposure times . to avoid detector saturation and improve upon the signal - to - noise ratio in near infrared bands , a set of large number of frames with short exposure times",
    "are taken at one position .",
    "several such sets of images are taken keeping the source at different locations on the detector with 280 and 220 seconds of total integration times in j and h bands , respectively .",
    "at least two comparison stars are kept in each frame for magnitude calibration .",
    "a large number of dark frames with same exposure times as used in source observations were also taken every night .",
    "data reduction and analysis was performed using iraf and locally developed scripts details of which are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "all the source images in a set were combined and dark subtracted . to take care of background sky ,",
    "sky image was constructed from all the images taken during the night and subtracted from the source images .",
    "the resultant 1es2344 + 514 images were then flat fielded and treated for bad pixels and cosmic ray correction .",
    "the final images containing the source , 1es2344 + 514 , and calibration stars were subjected to aperture photometry keeping the aperture size same for the source and the comparison stars .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes thus obtained were used for differential photometry light curves .",
    "the source magnitudes were corrected using standard magnitude values of the comparison stars and these corrected j and h band magnitudes are plotted in figure 5 as a function of time in mjd .",
    "it is clear from the figure that during 2004 observations , 1es2344 + 514 shows low level (  0.06 magnitude ) day - to - day variation in both , j & h bands .",
    "the j band magnitude of the source remains around 12.85 which is about the average value for the source .",
    "the source , therefore , does not show any flaring / outburst activity in this energy regime during this period .",
    "it should be noted that the host galaxy of the 1es2344 + 514 is relatively bright and stellar light from the host is capable of affecting the measurement of nuclear emissions , particularly when the seeing conditions are not good @xcite . under such observing conditions , while making observations in optical and near infrared , it is necessary to keep the aperture size fairly large in order to minimise the effect of host emission on the intrinsic variations in the nuclear flux . on the other hand ,",
    "too large an aperture allows dilution of the nuclear emission and dampens amplitude of its intrinsic variation .",
    "both these factors decide the size of aperture used in the photometric observations when the host is bright .",
    "we have taken care of these aspects in the present study by following the recommendation given in @xcite . in our case , the seeing fwhm varied from about 2.5@xmath11 to 3.3@xmath11 ( in the worst case ) and therefore to optimize the photometric results , we have used 8 pixels as photometric aperture radius .",
    "the choice enables us to achieve good s / n ratio while keeping any spurious variation in source brightness , caused by seeing change and host galaxy contribution , below 0.01 mag .",
    "however , during most of the nights observing conditions were very good , photometric or close to photometric .",
    "we exercised extra precaution whenever we noticed variation in seeing .",
    "in particular , during the october 2005 epoch when the sky conditions were not stable leading to poor seeing , we used several standard stars to calibrate the source magnitude apart from the measures mentioned above",
    ". stars were chosen to have about same magnitude as the source as recommended by @xcite .    in the 2005 observation epoch ,",
    "the source is seen in fainter ( j magnitude @xmath7 12.6 ) state during october 26- 27 ( mjd 53670- 53671 ) , brightening up by 0.41 magnitude on december 6 , 2005 ( mjd 53710 ) .",
    "it then fades by about 0.2 magnitude during 6 to 10 december , 2005 .",
    "however , intra - night variations appear to be within 1 @xmath4 level .",
    "it shows similar behaviour in both , j and h , bands .",
    "since we do not have a continuous coverage of the source during october - december , 2005 , it is not possible for us to state whether 1es2344 + 514 had several flares or a slow increase in flux during the brightening phase .",
    "it would be very interesting to know the behaviour of the source in radio , optical and x - ray regions in order to infer the nature of near infrared emission - whether it is thermal or mostly non - thermal .",
    "the rxte asm(2 - 12 kev ) x - ray data used here does not indicate any significant variation during this period .",
    "we are not aware of any observations in radio or optical region which could throw more light on the nature of the source during this period .",
    "we have studied the bl lac object 1es2344 + 514 in vhe gamma - ray and near infrared wavelength bands with tactic and miro telescopes respectively during 2004 - 2005 .",
    "we do not find any evidence for the presence of a statistically significant vhe gamma - ray signal , both in the overall data and on a nightly basis from the source above the threshold energy of 1.5 tev .",
    "an upper limit of i(@xmath01.5 tev)@xmath12 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 has been obtained at a 3@xmath4 confidence level on the integrated @xmath5-ray flux and we conclude that the source was below the upper limit flux during the periods of these observations .",
    "the derived upperlimit has been shown in figure 6 for comparison with the other vhe results from whipple @xcite , hegra @xcite and magic @xcite groups on the same blazar 1es2344 + 514 .",
    "as is clear from this figure the tactic upperlimit is not in conflict with the magic @xcite group detection of the source in 2005 , as it is placed at i(@xmath131.5 tev)@xmath12 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 whereas the magic detected integral flux f(@xmath131.5 tev ) = @xmath14 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 is much lower than the tactic upperlimit . in the rxte asm energy domain",
    "( 2 - 12 kev ) too , the light curves obtained from the rxte site @xcite , which we have shown in figure 4 , do not show any statistically significant evidence for variations in the day averaged sum band intensity counts .",
    "our observational results in the near infrared wavelength bands are , however mixed , wherein the source 1es2344 + 514 shows low level (  0.06 magnitude ) day - to - day variation in both , j & h bands during 2004 observations . whereas , during 2005 observations in the same bands , the source brightens up by about 0.41 magnitude from its october 2005 level j magnitude = 12.64 to j = 12.23 magnitude on december 6 , 2005 .",
    "it then fades by about 0.2 magnitude during 6 to 10 december , 2005 .",
    "the variation is seen in both , j & h , bands simultaneously . from these near infrared observations ,",
    "we conclude that the source has possibly undergone a brightening phase during 2005 miro observations .",
    "further , the flux variations within a timescale of a day in the rxte asm and tactic energy ranges are low , when the source brightens by 0.41 magnitude in low energy near infrared region over a period of about 42 days or fades by 0.2 magnitude over a period of about 5 days . by considering the light travel time arguments and taking the fastest source variation in this study ( 0.2 magnitude in 5-days ) , the size of the near infrared emission region is about 5-light days ( 1.08@xmath15 cm ) . here",
    ", we have taken into account the doppler factor of the jet as 8.4 , obtained by @xcite for the low state of the source and assuming that the variable near infrared emission is likely produced in the relativistic jet .",
    "this source is dimmer than mrk 421 and mrk 501 at every wavelength so it is perhaps not surprising that the vhe emission of 1es2344 + 514 appears to be weaker on average .",
    "long term simultaneous multi - wavelength observations , with improved sensitivity particularly in tev domain , are required to understand the emission mechanisms .",
    "the authors would like to convey their gratitude to all the concerned colleagues of the astrophysical sciences division for their contributions towards the instrumentation and observation aspects of the tactic telescope .",
    "the valuable suggestions from anonymous referees are gratefully acknowledged . finally , we are thankful to dr .",
