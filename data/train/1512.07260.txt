    "in the usual hadronic scale the pion is special , because it is ( unusually ) the lightest bound state of the quark - antiquark , and also plays a key role in the chiral perturbation theory  ( see the review  @xcite ) .",
    "deep inelastic scattering  ( dis ) , or the hadronic scattering , may be decomposed into two parts , a part depends on the short distance partonic cross section , and a part depends on the long distance process  @xcite .",
    "the distribution amplitude  ( da ) provides the link between these two parts , or , with another words , pertubative regime  ( small distance ) and non - pertubative  ( long distance ) regime .",
    "the hadronic states , mesons and baryons , have been sucessfully organized in terms of the valence quark components , or constituent picture ( see the particle data group  @xcite ) . however , on the other hand , in the case of the _ deep inelastic scattering _ , the hadronic systems also have other degrees of freedom , i.e. , gluons and the sea of quarks . in the hadronic systems , the distributions amplitudes ( das )  are important to characterize the feature of the bound state nature , because they provide essential information on them , such as electromagnetic and transition form factors  @xcite .    in the following sections",
    "we present the model utilized , and the results .",
    "the model used in the present study is the light - front constituent quark model  ( lfcqm ) with a symmetric vertex function , which was used already in the previus work for pion  @xcite , and recently for pion and kaon  @xcite to calculated the observables associated with them .",

    "but in a general frame ,",
    "i.e ,  @xmath24 ,   it is necessary to include the zero - mode contribuitions  @xcite .",
    "this is also true in the case of the other components , such as the minus component of the current  @xcite to preserve the full covariance .    in general , the parton distribution function ( pdf ) of either pion or kaon",
    "is related with the corresponding wave function by the following equation , @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the decay constant of pion or kaon , and @xmath27 the corresponding valence wave function .",

    "the constraint of the electromagnetic charge form factor ,  @xmath29 , and the equation above for the normalization of the wave function , the parameters are determined .",

    "is symmetric around @xmath40 for both cases , the asymptotic wave function and the present model .",
    "however , in the case of the kaon , the da is not symmetric for the interchange of the quark  ( @xmath1 ) and the antiquark  ( @xmath0 ) , that can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
