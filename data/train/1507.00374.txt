    "@xmath23spin frustration@xmath24 is one of the most exciting frontiers of contemporary research in condensed matter physics.@xcite historically , the interest in spin frustration was raised long ago by anderson s prediction for a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state ( sometimes called @xmath23spin liquid state@xmath24 ) , as an alternative to the classical nel state @xcite for a magnetic ground state in a two - dimensional triangular - lattice @xmath25 = 1/2 antiferromagnet . from a classical point of view,@xcite",
    "this generates a very high degeneracy of the ground state , translating into a huge density of low energy excitations , no long - range order at @xmath26 = 0 k , and a very short magnetic correlation length characteristic of a @xmath23spin liquid state@xmath24 .",
    "experimentally , many of the spin frustrated systems , such as triangular - lattice , kagom - lattice and pyrochlores , have been investigated to elucidate the magnetic ground state .",
    "however , most of the systems show short - range or long - range magnetic order , due to small perturbations such as defects , anisotropy , and lattice distortion.@xcite this prevents the effects purely associated with spin frustrations from direct observation .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to clarify what kind of state is actually realized as the ground state of such a strongly frustrated system and more ideal compounds to investigate the effects of spin frustration in the ground state are strongly desired .",
    "recent progress in synthesizing nanoscale molecular magnets offers the opportunity to investigate the effects of spin frustration at nanoscale levels.@xcite molecular magnets are composed of a controllable number of magnetic ions with spins located on a triangle , tetrahedron , ring , ball , and other geometries.@xcite since the distance between the magnetic molecules themselves is usually more than @xmath14 1.5 nm , the magnetic interaction between the molecules is very small and usually three - dimensional magnetic ordering does not occur even at very low temperatures down to mk .",
    "thus , one can investigate the magnetic properties of the single molecular system at very low temperatures without any disturbance from magnetic orderings .",
    "the simplest spin frustrated system is three @xmath25 = 1/2 antiferromagnetically coupled spins with a triangular configuration . in a molecular nanomagnet , this simplest spin frustration system can really exist and one can investigate this simplest system experimentally.@xcite    an innovative idea to utilize the nanoscale molecular magnet as a magnetic unit produced a great breakthrough for synthesizing a new class of spin frustration systems called spin ball @xcite and triangular spin tube.@xcite the spin ball system has a spherical shape constructed from twenty afm triangles with spin frustration . in the spin tube ,",
    "af triangles form a one - dimensional chain as shown in fig .",
    "although these peculiar structures have attracted much interest @xcite the systems were considered to be only toy models for theoretical study , due to the lack of real model materials before the synthesis breakthrough .    in this review ,",
    "we discuss the magnetic properties of these peculiarly - structured spin frustration systems studied by using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) technique .",
    "nmr has proved to be a powerful tool for investigating both static and dynamic properties of nanoscale molecular magnets.@xcite the nmr spectrum gives us information on the hyperfine interaction of the nuclei with the local magnetic moments , in particular the @xmath23on - site@xmath24 nmr spectrum of nuclei on magnetic ions provides direct information on the local magnetic moments of the magnetic ions . on the other hand , the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate ( 1/@xmath18 ) directly probes the low - frequency spectral weight of spin fluctuations of the local magnetic moments .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive review of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies performed on three nanoscale molecular magnets with different configurations of geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic ( afm ) triangles , new spin frustration systems with different novel structures : ( 1 ) the isolated single afm triangle k@xmath0[v@xmath1as@xmath0o@xmath2(h@xmath3o)]@xmath48h@xmath3o ( in short v15 ) , ( 2 ) the spin ball [ mo@xmath5fe@xmath6o@xmath7(mo@xmath3o@xmath8(h@xmath3o))@xmath3 ( mo@xmath3o@xmath9h@xmath3(h@xmath3o))(ch@xmath10coo)@xmath11(h@xmath3o)@xmath12@xmath4150h@xmath3o ( in short fe30 spin ball ) , and ( 3 ) the twisted triangular spin tube [ ( cucl@xmath3tachh)@xmath10cl]cl@xmath3 ( in short cu3 spin tube ) . in the v15 nanomagnet , from @xmath13v nmr spectra </S>",
    "<S> observed at only below @xmath14 0.1 k , we directly determined the local spin configuration in both the nonfrustrated total spin @xmath15 = 3/2 state at higher magnetic fields ( @xmath16 t ) and the two nearly degenerate @xmath15 = 1/2 ground states at lower magnetic fields ( @xmath17 t ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical magnetic properties of v15 were investigated by proton spin - lattice relaxation rate ( 1/@xmath18 ) measurements . in the @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> = 3/2 state , 1/@xmath18 shows thermally activated behavior as a function of temperature . on the other hand , a temperature independent behavior of 1/@xmath18 at very low temperatures is observed in the frustrated @xmath15 = 1/2 ground state below 2.7 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> possible origins for the peculiar behavior of 1/@xmath18 will be discussed in terms of magnetic fluctuations due to spin frustrations . in fe30 spin ball , </S>",
    "<S> static and dynamical properties of fe@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) have been investigated by proton nmr spectra and 1/@xmath18 measurements . from the temperature dependence of 1/@xmath18 , the fluctuation frequency of the fe@xmath19 spins </S>",
    "<S> is found to decrease with decreasing temperature , indicating spin freezing at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the spin freezing is also evidenced by the observation of a sudden broadening of @xmath21h nmr spectra below 0.6 k. finally @xmath21h nmr data in the cu spin tube will be described . </S>",
    "<S> an observation of magnetic broadening of @xmath21h nmr spectra at low temperatures below 1 k directly revealed a gapless ground state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 measurements revealed an usual slow spin dynamics in the quasi one dimensional cu3 spin tube . </S>"
