    "the _ standard coherent states _ @xmath1 may be obtained from the action of displacement operator on the vacuum [ 1 ] , @xmath2 or the right eigenstate annihilation operator @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the standard bosonic annihilation , creation operators , respectively .",
    "the states @xmath7 are also minimum uncertainty states .",
    "it is well known that the expansion of these states in the fock space is as follows : @xmath8 where the set @xmath9 is the number states of the quantized harmonic oscillator with hamiltonian @xmath10 .    due to the fact that the bosonic annihilation and creation operators , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are singular operators , the inverse operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not well - defined .",
    "nevertheless , the following generalized operators may be found in literature through the actions [ 2 , 3 ] @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is @xmath16 when @xmath17 , otherwise it is @xmath18 ( so by definition @xmath19 ) .",

    ", the usefulness of these inverse operators in various contexts can be found in previous publications we shall address at this point .",
    "indeed , the operators in ( [ inv - crea - op ] ) and ( [ inv - ann - op ] ) have been studied in para - bose particles .",
    "in addition , these operators enable one to find the eigenvalue equation for the squeezed coherent states .",
    "the vacuum and the first exited squeezed states are the eigenstates of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively [ 4 ] .",
    "therefore , for instance , since the squeezed vacuum states can be generated through some nonlinear optical processes , it is remarkable that inverse bosonic operators may play an important role in studying the time evolution of some nonlinear systems .",
    "also , the important role of these operators has been followed in metaplectic group structure of @xmath27 group , which is a two - fold cover of @xmath28 and @xmath29 groups [ 5 ] .",
    "let us recall that _",
    "`` photon added coherent states '' _ first introduced by agarwal and tara [ 6 ] are closely related to the inverse bosonic operators [ 3 ] , where it has been shown that these states denoted by @xmath30 are eigenstates of the operator @xmath31 with eigenvalues @xmath32 .",
    "subsequently , _",
    "`` photon subtracted coherent states '' _ can be obtained by @xmath33-times actions of @xmath11 on @xmath34 , followed by @xmath33-times actions of @xmath21 on the resultant states , i.e. @xmath35 .    nowadays generalization of coherent states besides their experimental generations have made much interest in quantum physics , especially in quantum optics [ 1 ] .",
    "these quantum states exhibit some interesting _ `` non - classical properties '' _ particularly squeezing , antibunching , sub - poissonian statistics and oscillatory number distribution . along achieving this goal",
    ", the first purpose of the present paper is to outline a formalism for the construction of coherent states associated to the _",
    "`` inverse bosonic operators '' _ , the states that have not been found in the literature up to know . but before paying attention to the this matter , a question may naturally arise about the relation between the operators @xmath21 and @xmath11 and the standard coherent states @xmath34 .",
    "due to the second equation in ( [ inv - r - l ] ) it is readily found that the following does not hold : @xmath36 , which at first glance may be expected from equation ( [ eigen - css ] ) .",
    "instead , one has @xmath37.\\ ] ] this is consistent with the fact that right eigenstate of the operator @xmath11 does not exist , originates from the creation - like characteristic of @xmath11 [ 2 ] .",
    "also it can be seen that the standard coherent state @xmath34 in ( [ scs ] ) is not the eigenstate of @xmath21 , one has instead @xmath38    nevertheless , as we will observe , `` nonlinear coherent state method '' provides a rich enough mathematical structure allowing us to establish our aim .",
    "we will illustrate that although the presented formalism yields a nonnormalizable coherent state corresponding to the inverse bosonic operator ( @xmath21 ) , the associated dual family is well - defined . in the continuation of the paper , along generalization of the proposal to the _",
    "`` inverse nonlinear ( @xmath0-deformed ) ladder operators '' _ involved in the nonlinear coherent states context in quantum optics , the associated generalized coherent states have been also introduced .",
    "then , as some physical realizations of the proposed formalism , hydrogen - like spectrum , harmonious states and gilmore - perelomov representation of @xmath39 group have been considered .",
    "taking into account their nonlinearity functions , we shall deduce the explicit form of the corresponding coherent states associated to the inverse @xmath0-deformed operators .",
    "at last , we conclude the paper with investigating some interesting nonclassical properties , for instance sub - poissonian statistics ( anti - bunching ) and the squeezing of the quadratures of the field of the obtained states , numerically .",
    "in this section after presenting a brief review of the nonlinear coherent states , we are going to establish a link between the `` inverse bosonic '' and `` @xmath0-deformed ( nonlinear ) ladder '' operators .",
    "the notion of _ `` nonlinear '' _ or _",
    "`` @xmath0-deformed '' _ coherent states which provides a powerful method to analyze a large number of the quantum optics states [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] .",
    "any class of these states , characterized by a particular intensity dependent function @xmath40 , is defined as the solution of the typical eigenvalue equation @xmath41 , with decomposition in the number states space as : @xmath42!}\\;| n   \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the @xmath0-deformed annihilation operator , @xmath44 ! \\doteq",

    "the nonorthogonality ( as a consequence of overcompleteness ) of the states in ( [ nlcsf ] ) , i.e. @xmath48 ( and all the new states will be introduced in the present paper ) is so clear matter we pay no attention to it .",
    "these states are required to satisfy the resolution of the identity @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 is a positive weight function may be found after specifying @xmath40 , and @xmath52 is the domain of the states in the complex plane defined by the disk @xmath53\\},\\ ] ] centered at the origin in the complex plane . inserting the explicit form of the states ( [ nlcsf ] ) in ( [ res - ffff ] ) with @xmath54 it can be easily checked that the resolution of the identity holds if the following moment problem is satisfied : @xmath55!,\\qquad n=0,1,2,\\cdots , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the radius of convergence determined by the relation ( [ diskff ] ) .",
    "the condition ( [ res - fff ] ) presents a severe restriction on the choice of @xmath40 .",
    "altogether , there are cases for which the completeness of some previously introduced coherent states has been demonstrated a few years later elsewhere ( photon added coherent states introduced in 1991 [ 6 ] while their completeness condition demonstrated in 2001 [ 10 ] ) .",
    "in fact , only a relatively small number of @xmath40 functions are known , for which the functions @xmath58 can be extracted . the action of @xmath0-deformed creation operator defined as @xmath59 on the number states expresses as follows @xmath60 now , going back to our goal in the paper , comparing equations ( [ af ] ) and ( 5 ) it can be easily seen that , @xmath61 similarly , using the action of @xmath62deformed annihilation operator @xmath63 on the number states , i.e. @xmath64 and then comparing with ( [ inv - crea - op ] ) one readily finds @xmath65 with the same @xmath66 introduced in ( [ f - bos ] ) .",
    "note that the following also holds @xmath67 therefore , taking into account all the above results we can write the explicit forms of the inverse bosonic operators denoted by @xmath63 and @xmath68 , and the related actions as follow [ 7 ] : @xmath69 @xmath70 actually in the latter equations the nonlinearity function is considered as @xmath71 .",
    "the equations ( [ af - non ] ) and ( [ af-1 ] ) confirm us that @xmath63 ( @xmath72 ) annihilates ( creates ) one ( deformed ) quanta of photon in some optical processes , respectively .",
    "for the commutation relation between the two ladder operators introduced in ( [ af - non ] ) and ( [ af-1 ] ) one arrives at @xmath73 = - \\frac { 1 } { \\hat n ( \\hat n+1 ) } , \\quad     \\mbox{for}\\;\\ ; n \\neq 0,\\ ] ] and @xmath74 = |0 \\rangle \\langle 0 | , \\quad      \\mbox{for}\\;\\ ;      n=0.\\ ] ] interestingly , this method with the factorized hamiltonian formalism , permits one to derive a hamiltonian responsible to the dynamics of the ( inverse ) system as [ 9 ] @xmath75 where one may define @xmath76 for @xmath17 , consistent with the definitions in ( [ inv - crea - op ] ) and ( [ inv - ann - op ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in this case is the inverse of the hamiltonian of the standard ( shifted ) harmonic oscillator @xmath77 . unlike the quantized harmonic oscillator ,",
    "the spectrum of the new hamiltonian system , @xmath78 , is not equally distanced ( arises from the nonlinearity nature of the inverse system ) .",
    "now , one may look for right eigenstate of the annihilation - like operator @xmath63 such that @xmath80 the superscript @xmath81 on any state @xmath82 ( in the whole of the present paper ) refers to the state corresponds to an `` inverse '' operator .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the state @xmath79 satisfies the eigenvalue equation ( [ inv - css ] ) has the following expansion in the fock space @xmath83 with the normalization constant @xmath84 which clearly diverges .",
    "therefore , precisely speaking the eigenstate of the annihilation - like operator @xmath85 does really exist but unfortunately it is physically meaningless ( due to nonnormalizablity of the state ) .",
    "this is an expected result since the relation ( [ diskff ] ) determines the radius of convergence equal to 0 when @xmath86 , i.e. for the case in hand .",
    "so , the states in ( [ nlcs - inv - bos ] ) can not actually belong to the hilbert space .      in what follows",
    "we will observe that the _ dual family _ of the states in ( [ nlcs - inv - bos ] ) is well - defined .",
    "for this purpose , it is possible to define two new operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 as follows @xmath90 thus , one has @xmath91=\\hat i = [ b_f , \\ ; a^\\dag _ f]$ ] .",
    "these properties allow one to define the generalized ( non - unitary ) displacement operator as follows @xmath92,\\ ] ] the action of which on the vacuum of the field gives the already obtained state in ( [ nlcs - inv - bos ] ) .",
    "but , according to the proposal has been recently introduced in refs .",

    "the normalization constant @xmath96 can be obtained as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the generalized hypergeometric function and @xmath99 with @xmath100 the well - known gamma function .",
    "it can be observed that these states can be defined on the whole space of complex plane .",
    "nowadays the states in ( 9 ) and ( 29 ) are known under the name _",
    "`` dual family '' _ or _ `` dual pair '' _ coherent states [ 11 , 12 ] .",
    "it can be checked straightforwardly that the nonlinear coherent states in ( [ cs - invers - dual ] ) are also the right eigenstates of the deformed annihilation operator @xmath101 .",
    "thanks to j r klauder _ et al _ for they established the resolution of the identity of the states in ( [ cs - invers - dual ] ) via the moment problem technique [ 13 ] .",
    "generalizing the proposed approach to the @xmath102-deformed rising and lowering operators @xmath103 corresponding to nonlinear oscillator algebra , one can define @xmath104 and @xmath105 where in the third steps of the derivation of the equations ( [ inv - ann - nonl ] ) and ( [ inv - crea - nonl ] ) the left equations of ( [ af-1 ] ) and ( [ af - non ] ) have been used , respectively . in the continuation of the paper",
    "we shall call @xmath106 as the _ `` original '' _ nonlinearity function .",
    "it is worth to mention two points .",
    "firstly , is that the `` generalized nonlinearity function '' @xmath107 has been defined in terms of the original nonlinearity function @xmath106 as @xmath108 and secondly since the original nonlinearity function @xmath109 is considered to be an operator valued function which generally can be complex [ 14 ] , so is @xmath107 .",

    "interestingly , the hamiltonian @xmath125 in ( [ hamilt - bob ] ) is the inverse of the hamiltonian of the `` original nonlinear oscillator '' which is a familiar feature in the nonlinear coherent states context .",
