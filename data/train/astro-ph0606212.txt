    "important clues on galaxy formation and evolution may be obtained by characterizing statistically the properties of their neighbourhoods in the local universe .",
    "it is well known that several properties of galaxies depend on the environment where they formed and evolved where a variety of processes such as star formation , tidal stripping , merging , etc . can determine the nature of galaxies .",
    "it should also be considered the possibility of agn feedback processes which could induce significant changes in the evolution of their companion galaxies ( see for instance croton et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "previous works aimed to characterize the quasar neighbourhood indicate that high redshift quasars can be used as signspots to search for rich density regions ( djorgovski 1999 , hall & green 1998 , fukugita 2003 ) .",
    "however , at lower redshifts ( z @xmath7 0.3 ) different studies indicate that quasars could reside in environments similar to those of normal galaxies ( smith , boyle & maddox 1995 , sorrentino 2006 ) or they could be located in groups ( fisher et al .",
    "1996 ) or clusters of galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ) .",
    "coldwell et al . 2002 , analysing both the projected cross - correlation function and colours of galaxies around a sample of quasars and agns found that their typical galaxy density environment corresponds to groups of galaxies .",
    "moreover , coldwell & lambas ( 2003 , hereafter paperi ) , using the spectral information of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , found that the galaxies within @xmath8 from quasars have a stronger star formation activity .",
    "these results are also supported by findings of soechting ( 2002 , 2004 ) who found that low redshift quasars follow the large - scale structure traced by galaxy clusters but they are not placed in the central area of galaxy clusters .",
    "more likely , they are in the cluster periphery or between two , possibly merging , galaxy clusters .    the large recent spectroscopic surveys , the sloan digital sky survey and the 2df galaxy redshift survey allow us investigate a wide range of galaxy properties such as morphology , spectral types , colours and , also , the galaxy density using volume - limited samples .",
    "in this paper we extend the work of paperi by analysing the environment of sloan quasars using the spectroscopic and photometric information available for the sloan digital sky survey third data release ( sdss ) .",
    "we divided the sample in two range of redshift @xmath9 and @xmath10 in order to anaelyse different effects in these two redshift ranges populated by galaxies of different luminosities .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data , section 3 shows the analysis of the local density estimates , section 4 and 5 describes the statistical analysis performed with the photometric and spectroscopic data respectively , and in section 6 we provide a brief discussion of the main results .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in 5 optical bands will map one - quarter of the entire sky and perform a redshift survey of galaxies , quasars and stars .",
    "the third data release , dr3 , from sdss provides a database of @xmath11 galaxies and @xmath12 quasars with measured spectra .",
    "the five filters _ u , g , r , i , _ and _ z _ cover the entire wavelength range of the ccd response ( fukugita 1996 ) . the main galaxy sample is essentially a magnitude limited spectroscopic sample ( with a petrosian magnitude ) _ _ @xmath13__@xmath14 , most of galaxies span a redshift range @xmath15 with a median redshift of 0.1 ( strauss 2002 ) .    the quasar sample is defined by quasars which have at least one emission line with a full width at half maximum larger than @xmath16 , luminosities brighter than @xmath17 , psf magnitude @xmath18 and highly reliable redshifts ( schneider 2003 ) .",
    "the galaxy groups from sdss were identified by merchn & zandivarez ( 2005 ) by using the friends - of - friends algorithm developed by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) which was improved by implementing a procedure to avoid the artificial merging of small systems in high density regions and applying an iterative method to recompute the group centres position .",
    "the group sample has a median velocity dispersion of @xmath19 and we restrict our target to those groups with a minimum number of 8 members to obtain higher density environment .    as a way to reject the hypothesis that quasars could reside in environments such as that corresponding to galaxy groups we use three different target samples , taken from sdss , in order to compare quasar environment with those corresponding to typical galaxies and galaxy groups and we make appropriate comparisons of galaxy characteristics of quasar neighbourhoods with respect to those in a low density environments corresponding to typical galaxies and denser environments as galaxy groups .",
    "we analyzed galaxy properties in the neighbourhood of different target samples in two ranges of redshifts in order to explore for a luminosity dependence :    @xmath20 , hereafter @xmath21 : : :    418 sdss quasars , 1147 sdss galaxies and 779 sdss galaxy groups .",
    "@xmath10 , hereafter @xmath22 : : :    1652 sdss quasars , 1153 sdss galaxies , 102 galaxy groups .",
    "the targets were selected to match the observed quasar redshift distribution , showed in fig . 1",
    ", in order to have unbiased and directly comparable results and the samples have the largest number of objects ( within the redshift restriction ) which suffices to provide reliable statistical results .",
    "by doing so , we assume that there are not redshift - dependent systematics such as those associated to low luminosity galaxies .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test yields that the redshift distributions are very similar with a 90 % level of confidence .",
    "tracer galaxies consist of all objects within projected distance @xmath23 and with radial velocity difference @xmath4 relative to the targets , so that both targets and tracers have a similar redshift distribution .     and @xmath22 .",
    "dashed lines correspond to quasars , solid lines to typical galaxies , and dotted lines to groups of galaxies.,width=272,height=283 ]",
    "a useful characterization of the local galaxy density can be obtained by measuring the distance to the @xmath24 nearest neighbour and estimating the density within that distance .",
    "the advantage of this method is to use a systematically larger scale in lower - density regions which improves sensitivity and precision at low densities .",
    "this is a two - dimensional estimate but we use the redshift information to lower the projection effects .",
    "we choose a fixed velocity interval of @xmath25 to compute the local density which correspond to galaxies within @xmath26 from the centre of a galaxy cluster ( balogh 2004 ) and this allows inclusion of galaxies in system with large velocity dispersion . when computing projected distances we have assumed a flat cosmology ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) and a hubble constant @xmath30 .",
    "we calculate surface densities , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , corresponding to the projected distance @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the first and fifth neighbour brighter than @xmath35 respectively .",
    "this absolute magnitude limit assures completeness within the redshift range explored , @xmath36    @xmath37     @xmath38 ( left panels ) and @xmath39 @xmath40 ( right panels ) for galaxies in the neighbourhoods of quasars ( dashed lines ) , typical galaxies ( solid ) , and groups of galaxies ( dotted ) , for two ranges of redshift .",
    ", width=340,height=302 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we show the relative distribution of @xmath31 and @xmath32 where it can be appreciated that the local density of quasar environment is pretty similar to that corresponding to typical galaxies .",
    "the @xmath31 density parameter corresponds to a closest neighbor distance estimate ( within the luminosity restrictions ) so that the results of fig .",
    "2 indicate that galaxy interactions are not likely to be directly associated to quasar phenomena .",
    "the errorbar in this figure and in all figures were calculated by using boostrap error resampling ( barrow 1984 ) .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "2 strongly suggest that local quasars avoid systematically high and moderately high density regions such as groups of galaxies .",
    "different magnitude measurements are provided in sdss , asinh magnitude , petrosian magnitude , fiber magnitude , etc . where galaxies bright enough to be included in the spectroscopic sample , @xmath41 , have relatively high signal - to - noise ratio . since petrosian magnitudes are model independent and yield a large fraction of the total flux , roughly constant with redshift , they provide an adequate magnitude measurement .",
    "we have used the modified form of the petrosian ( 1976 ) system which measures galaxy fluxes within a circular aperture whose radius is defined by the shape of the azimuthally averaged light profile in order to measure a constant fraction of the total light , independent of the position and distance of the objects .",
    "galaxy colours can be used as estimators of the galaxy evolution . in clusters , the large fraction of red galaxies indicate an old population of galaxies with a low star formation rate .",
    "galaxies in poor groups or in the field are bluer and with stronger star formation rate .    , relative to the total number in each bin of projected distance @xmath42 from the targets : quasar neighbourhoods ( empty circles ) , typical galaxies ( solid lines ) , and groups of galaxies ( filled triangles ) .",
    "right panels : distributions of @xmath43 colours of neighbour galaxies , within @xmath44 , to sloan quasars ( dashed lines ) , groups of galaxies ( dotted lines ) and typical galaxies ( solid line ) in the range @xmath20 , @xmath45 @xmath10 .",
    ", width=340,height=302 ]    we calculate the corrected colours @xmath43 of galaxies in the neighbourhood of the targets by using k and extinction corrected absolute magnitude ( blanton 2003 ) .",
    "we analyse the relative distribution of @xmath43 for galaxies around the targets where we observe an excess of blue galaxies in the environments of quasars . to determine the significance of this excess we calculate the relative fraction of galaxies bluer than a given threshold value , we selected the fraction of galaxies with @xmath46 which correspond approximately to the mean @xmath43 for the spectroscopic survey at @xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    we can see in this figure that the fraction of blue neighbours of a typical galaxy tends to decrease at small separations .",
    "this effect that can be interpreted as the usual morphology - density relation and , as expected , this decrease is even stronger as one approach group centres .",
    "however , contrary to this behaviour , the blue fraction does not decline at close separations and there is a significant relative excess of blue galaxies in quasar neighbourhoods compared to typical galaxies .",
    "this result is perhaps an indication of feedback process operated by quasars which could delay star formation at early stages allowing for more recent activity from the remaining gas .      in sdss",
    "are also available the apparent radii containing @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the petrosian flux for each band .",
    "the ratio of these fluxes , the concentration index @xmath49 , is correlated with morphology . since galaxies with a de - vaucouleurs profile have a value of @xmath50 and disk galaxies have a concentration index @xmath51 this parameter can be used as a simple morphological classifier . in fig .",
    "4 we can see the distribution of the concentration index parameter and the fraction of late type galaxies defined with @xmath52 as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the larger relative fraction of disk - type galaxies in quasar neighbourhoods can be clearly appreciated corresponding to @xmath53 excess of disk - type objetcs .    , relative to the total number in each bin of projected distance @xmath42 from the targets : quasar neighbourhoods ( empty circles ) , typical galaxies ( solid lines ) , and groups of galaxies ( filled triangles ) .",
    "right panels : distributions of concentration index c of neighbour galaxies , within @xmath44 , to sloan quasars ( dashed lines ) , groups of galaxies ( dotted lines ) and typical galaxies ( solid line ) in the ranges z1 and z2 . ,",
    "the regulation of star formation in galaxies can be strongly influenced by close companions . besides the effects of environment , galaxies in pairs have enhanced star formation over a control sample with similar characteristics which is stronger for galaxy pairs in field that in groups of galaxies .",
    "lambas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and alonso et al ( 2004 ) found clear evidence that star formation is enhanced over @xmath54 in close interactions .",
    "this star formation induction increases for small relative velocity and projected separation @xmath42 .    on the other hand ,",
    "feeding a massive black hole at the centre of galaxies may require particular conditions which could be strongly influenced by environment .",
    "although at large redshifts quasars and radio galaxies are frequently associated to clusters , at lower redshifts , a dense environment may be hostile to the presence of massive black holes ( coldwell , martinez & lambas 2002 , coldwell & lambas 2003 ) .    ) , @xmath55 , and fraction of early galaxies ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 , relative to the total number in each bin of projected distance @xmath42 from the targets in the neighbourhoods of quasars ( empty circles ) , typical galaxies ( solid line ) and groups of galaxies ( filled triangles ) in the ranges @xmath21 ( left panels ) and @xmath22 ( right panels ) .",
    ", width=340,height=302 ]    in paperi we explored the nature of galaxies in the vicinity of the different target samples using the 2dfgrs spectral type index @xmath58 .",
    "this parameter approximately delineates the transition between early and late morphological types for @xmath59 .",
    "when considering @xmath60 we are dealing with galaxies particularly active , such as starbursts with recent episodes of star - formation or agns .",
    "sdss galaxies are also classified by a principal component analysis , pca ( connolly & szalay 1999 ) , where five eigencoefficients , ecoeff , are extracted .",
    "similarly to the 2dfgrs spectral type classification sdss provides a spectral type parameter s with the first two eigencoefficients like @xmath61 which ranges from about -0.35 to 0.5 for early to late galaxies . taking in",
    "to account this and the corresponding galaxies for sdss and 2dfgrs , we consider galaxies with @xmath56 as being similar spectra than their 2df counterparts with ( @xmath62 ) . also , sdss galaxies with @xmath63 correspond to the 2df galaxies with @xmath64 the fraction , @xmath55 , galaxies with strong star formation activity ( @xmath63 ) , and the fraction @xmath57 of early spectral type galaxies ( @xmath56 ) , are shown for the two ranges of redshifts @xmath21 and @xmath22 in fig .",
    "5 . the effect is similar to that of 2df galaxies in fig . 1 of paperi where it is clear that galaxies around quasars differ from that in galaxy and group environments .",
    "several important properties of galaxies have been derived for subsamples of sdss : stellar masses , indicators of recent major starbursts , current total and specific star - formation rates ( brinchmann 2004 ) and emission - line fluxes ( tremonti 2004 ) both for the regions with spectroscopy and for the galaxies as a whole ; gas - phase metallicities ; agn classifications ( kauffmann 2003 ) based on the standard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams , etc .",
    "the relation between spectral lines , @xmath1\\lambda 5007 $ ] , @xmath65 , @xmath2\\lambda 6583 $ ] and @xmath66 luminosities , can be used to analyse possible dependence of the relative numbers of agns and star forming galaxies in quasar neighborhoods compared to galaxy and group environments .",
    "we constructed the baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( bpt , 1981 ) line - ratio diagram and we used the kauffmann ( 2003 ) criteria to differentiate agns galaxies from other emission - line objects dominated by star formation .",

    "similar results were found for the redshift range z2 .",
    "to quantify this result we calculated the percentage of agn neighbours within @xmath68 from the three target samples obtaining that 37.9 % , 35.2% and 34.5 % of galaxies in the vicinity of groups , galaxies and quasars , respectively , are agns indicating that the agn activity is not strongly affected by quasars .    ) galaxies in the bpt line - ratio diagram for the three target samples at z1 .",
    "the solid line shows the division of the samples .",
    ", width=302,height=340 ]    taking into account the previous results which indicate that quasar environments are populated by blue , disk - type , star forming galaxies , we have computed the fraction of agns ( in different environments ) which have these characteristics ( @xmath69 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "the corresponding fractions of agns obtained are 6.7 % , 5.3% and 6.4 % in the vicinity of groups , galaxies and quasars , respectively indicating that agn contribution to blue star forming galaxies is not significant in any environment .",
    "the methods for deriving the star formation rates are based on models where the contribution of the nebular emission by hii regions and diffuse ionized gas combined and described in terms of effective metallicity , ionization parameter , dust attenuation at 5500 @xmath70 , and dust to metal ratio ( bruzual & charlot 1993 , charlot 2002 ) .",
    "taking into account these issues , brinchmann ( 2004 ) provide accurate total star formation rates estimates free from aperture bias .",
    "moreover , kauffmann ( 2003 ) developed a method to constrain star formation histories , dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies based on two stellar absorption lines indices , the 4000 @xmath70 break strength and the balmer absorption line index @xmath71 .",

    "taking into account the observed thresholds in projected separation @xmath42 and relative velocity @xmath77 for galaxy interactions to effectively induce star formation we calculated the fraction of targets with close companions ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "we find a low fraction ( @xmath80 ) of close companions associated to quasars , similar to that observed for galaxies in general .",
    "this result indicates that quasar fueling may not require the presence of close companion galaxies ( consistent with the distribution of @xmath31 shown in fig .",

    "the results are very similar to those of fig .",
    "7 , indicating the lack of relevance of close interactions in driving these relations .",
    "the unification hypothesis for active galactic nuclei and quasars ( antonucci 1993 ) is a model where all active galaxy classes are fundamentally the same phenomenon seen at different orientations which are not due to intrinsic differences as a final analysis we have explored the characteristics ( colours , specific star formation rates and concentration indexes ) of galaxies in agn environments ( ie . taking agns as targets ) in a similar fashion as in previous sections serving as a test of the unified agn model .",

    "@xmath83 agn and quasar environment are similar regarding the galaxy characteristics explored and agree best in the highest redshift interval giving support to the unified scenario of agns and quasars .",
    "although quasar hosts tend to be red and bulge - dominated galaxies ( kauffmann 2003 ) , the indication of a relative excess of quasar neighbour galaxies with a large gas fraction could suggest either an external origin for the accretion onto the central black hole , or that quasars may affect substantially the evolution of star formation up to the mpc scale .",
