    "we recently discovered a class 0 protostellar core , l1527 in the taurus molecular cloud , which is extremely rich in carbon - chain molecules @xcite . based on the detailed observations , carbon - chain molecules and their anions , c@xmath4h , c@xmath4h@xmath5 , hc@xmath4n , and c@xmath4h@xmath6 ,",
    "are confirmed to be enhanced in the warm and dense gas near the protostar , iras  04368 + 2557 , in l1527 .",
    "we call such a newly found chemical environment `` warm - carbon - chain - chemistry ( wccc ) '' .",
    "the origin of wccc is proposed to be a consequence of regeneration of carbon - chain molecules triggered by evaporation of ch@xmath7 from grain mantles in the warm ( @xmath830  k ) gas around the protostar @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has never been expected in classical chemical models for cold dark clouds where carbon - chain molecules are efficiently produced mainly through ion - molecular reactions initiated by atomic carbon before being fixed into co @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we carried out a survey of several carbon - chain molecules toward low - mass protostellar cores , and found the second wccc source , iras  15398@xmath33359 in the lupus molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "in addition to l1527 and iras  15398@xmath33359 , some possible candidates for wccc were recognized .",
    "one of them is l483 , where a rare molecule , l - c@xmath9h@xmath5 , is detected and the c@xmath7h abundance is relatively high @xcite .",
    "l483 is a well studied star - forming core associated with a protostar iras  18140@xmath30440 in the aquila rift at a distance of 200  pc @xcite . the evolutionary class of iras  18140@xmath30440 ( a transition from class 0 to class i ) is almost similar to that of iras  04368 + 2557 in l1527 .",
    "this source also seems to be outstanding in a survey of c@xmath9h@xmath5 @xcite , in which the c@xmath9h@xmath5 line is bright next to tmc-1 ( cyanopolyyne peak and nh@xmath9 peak ) and l1527 .    at the same time",
    ", we also identified l483 as a distinctly rich source of carbon - chain molecules like ccs , hc@xmath9n , and hc@xmath10n among star - forming dense cores @xcite .",
    "the ccs ( @xmath0=4@xmath113@xmath5 ) line is much brighter toward l483 than toward the two other wccc sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* n. sakai et al . in preparation ) . mapping observations with the 45  m telescope at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) revealed that the distribution of ccs has a centrally peaked structure .",
    "this seems consistent with the interferometric map of the cs ( @xmath12=2@xmath31 ) line which also shows a centrally peaked structure @xcite .",
    "although these features of ccs could be related to wccc , no signature of the ccs depletion may be due to a coarse spatial resolution ( 37 ) of the nro 45  m telescope @xcite",
    ". the resolution may be insufficient to resolve a central hole with the predicted radius of @xmath135000  au or 25  at the distance of l483 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the central hole of ccs in a class 0 protostellar core b335 is detected only by the interferometric observations @xcite . with this in mind , we have conducted a mapping observation of the ccs line toward l483 using the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "the observation was made with the vla in its d - configuration on 2009 october 26 .",
    "the observed line was ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) whose rest frequency is 22344.033  mhz @xcite .",
    "two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands were employed to receive dual circular polarizations with the bandwidth of 3.125  mhz for each .",
    "a spectral resolution was set to be 24.414  khz , or the velocity resolution of 0.32  km  s@xmath14 .",

    "= @xmath304@xmath183938.3 , and a secondary calibrator , 1743 - 038 , which is 8@xmath19.4 away from l483 , were observed over a cycle time of 12  minutes .",
    "for each cycle , 9  minutes were spent on l483 and 3  minutes on 1743 - 038 .",
    "the observation was allocated for 9  hr and the total on - source integration time was 4.2  hr .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated in the standard manner by using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package .",
    "the absolute flux density and bandpass calibrator was 1331 + 305 ( 3c286 ) , for which we adopted a flux density of 2.53  jy .",
    "amplitudes and phases were calibrated by observing the secondary calibrator 1743 - 038 .",
    "the bootstrapped flux density of 1743 - 038 was 2.99  jy .",
    "the doppler correction was applied in the post - processing using the aips task cvel .",
    "synthesis imaging and clean were made by using the aips task imagr . in order to achieve higher sensitivity",
    ", we adopted the robust weighting parameter of 5 ( natural weighting ) and the uvrange parameter from 0 to 25  k@xmath20 .",
    "the synthesized beam size was 7.87@xmath217.15 with the position angle of -28@xmath19.68 .",
    "the resulting image sensitivity was 4  mjy  beam@xmath14 for each spectral channel .",
    "figure [ fig - map ] shows the integrated intensity map of the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) line toward l483 , superposed on that of the ccs ( @xmath0=4@xmath113@xmath5 ) line at the 45  ghz band taken with the nro 45  m telescope @xcite .",
    "hereafter we just refer to the latter map as `` the single - dish ccs map '' , although the observed transition is different from that of the vla observation .",
    "the shortest projected baseline in the vla observation was 1.85  k@xmath20 , and was comparable to the primary beam size of the vla .",
    "thus , the structure larger than about 60  or a linear size of 12000  au was significantly filtered out . because we only observed the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) spectrum toward the core center with the nro 45  m telescope , as shown in figure [ fig - sp ] @xcite , a combined image by using both the interferometer and the single - dish data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could not be produced .    as depicted in figure [ fig - map ] ,",
    "the distribution of ccs consists of two compact clumps ; one is located at northwest , ( -28 , + 12 ) in right ascension and declination , respectively , of the protostar iras  18148 - 0440 , and the other is a weak component located from southeast to south of the protostar .",
    "the northwest clump has an fwhm size of 30@xmath2118  with the position angle of -26@xmath19 .",
    "although the size is much smaller than the ridge structure extending from northwest to southeast seen in the single - dish ccs map @xcite , these compact clumps apparently trace its portions ( figure [ fig - map ] ) .",
    "the southern clump agrees well with the local peak position of the single - dish map , which is slightly shifted to the south from the protostar position .",
    "the most remarkable feature found in the vla map is that the distribution of ccs is clearly depleted at the protostar position .",
    "the radio continuum source , _ iras _ point source ( iras  18148 - 0440 ) , and dust continuum peaks @xcite all lie between the two ccs clumps .",
    "this central depletion corresponds to that previously reported in the nh@xmath9 map taken with the vla @xcite .",
    "such a ccs hole is similar to the case of another protostellar core b335 @xcite and a dynamically evolved prestellar core l1544 @xcite , observed with vla and bima , respectively .",
    "it is unlikely that this hole is due to the self - absorption , because the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) line is usually optically thin @xcite .",
    "the hole can be interpreted as a consequence of real abundance decrease of ccs in the central part of a chemically and dynamically evolved core @xcite .",
    "no signature of depletion in the single - dish ccs map of l483 @xcite originates from an insufficient spatial resolution to resolve the central hole .",
    "figure [ fig - sp ] presents the total flux density of the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) line observed with the nro 45  m telescope whose beam size is 74  at 22  ghz @xcite , and the integrated flux density observed with the vla .",
    "the vla spectrum is obtained by summing over the emission region in the map by using the aips task ispec .",
    "the peak antenna temperature of the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) line is derived from the nro 45  m telescope to be 0.36  k @xcite , corresponding to the total flux density of 1.18  jy . on the other hand",
    ", the integrated flux density of the vla map only recovers 0.43  jy at the peak velocity channel .",
    "even though we employ only a central part of the uv data , more than 60% of the flux is missing in the vla image .",
    "the peak velocity channel derived from the vla map , 5.1  km  s@xmath14 , is slightly blueshifted from that of the single - dish spectrum , 5.36  km  s@xmath14 @xcite . a possible reason is that the systematic and redshifted velocity components are more extended than the blueshifted one , and are resolved out more significantly .",
    "this means that the ccs distribution does not have a compact central condensation .",
    "figure [ fig - chmap ] shows the channel maps of the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) line .",
    "we detected the ccs line only at the central two channels above the 3@xmath22 noise level .",
    "however , we can see a weak emission feature around the southeast of the protostar position at the 5.7  km  s@xmath14 channel .",
    "this emission feature is also evident at the 5.4 and 5.1  km  s@xmath14 channels , and hence , it could be real .",
    "because of our coarse spectral resolution , @xmath80.3  km  s@xmath14 , it is difficult to detect a small velocity structures of the l483 core caused by rotation , infall , expansion , and/or outflow ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , no significant velocity gradient is seen between the northwest and southeast clumps .",
    "various molecular lines have been mapped in high - resolution with interferometers toward l483 , including hco@xmath23 , c@xmath9h@xmath5 @xcite , nh@xmath9 @xcite , cn , c@xmath24o , cs , hcn , hco@xmath23 , n@xmath5h@xmath23 , and their isotopic species @xcite .",
    "single - dish mapping observations have also been conducted for some molecular lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dust continuum emission @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , none of them show a similar distribution to that of the ccs map taken with the vla at first glance , except for the single - dish ccs map @xcite .",
    "since the ccs linewidth is only less than 0.6  km  s@xmath14 and no correspondence with the velocity structure relevant to the outflow can be seen , the ccs clumps do not seem to interact with the outflow in contrast to the other molecular species @xcite .",
    "it is reported that the distribution of ccs and nh@xmath9/n@xmath5h@xmath23 are anticorrelated with each other @xcite .",
    "this seems true for l483 as a whole .",
    "the nh@xmath9 distribution appears to extend toward three directions , northwest , northeast , and southwest @xcite .",
    "the northwestern clump of ccs is located at about 10  west of the peak of the northwest nh@xmath9 ridge , although they are partly overlapped with each other .",
    "similarly , the distribution of ccs and n@xmath5h@xmath23 show mutual anticorrelation except for slight overlapping at the western and southeastern ends of the n@xmath5h@xmath23 and ccs distributions , respectively @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all of ccs , nh@xmath9 , and n@xmath5h@xmath23 show possible signature of depletion toward the protostar position @xcite .",
    "in contrast , c@xmath24o and cs are enhanced in the vicinity of the protostar @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as a consequence of evaporation from dust grains at the temperature above 40  k. in such a region , ch@xmath7 , whose sublimation temperature is 30  k , could also be evaporated from dust grains as expected in wccc @xcite .",
    "it is surprising that the distributions of ccs and cs show anti - correlation , because ccs is believed to be closely related to cs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results indicate that ccs is hardly enhanced by the activity of the central protostar , namely , a compact centrally condensed structure that is related to wccc is not detected",
    ". the observed ccs clumps might represent remnants of a quiescent cold outer envelope that still remains chemically young .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the mapping observation of c@xmath7h toward l1527 and iras  15398@xmath33359 @xcite , reporting that the significant fraction of c@xmath7h is also distributed in the cold outer envelope as well as the vicinity of the protostar @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the cold outer envelope relative to that from the central condensation seems to be larger than the c@xmath7h case in l1527 .",
    "if above considerations are true , higher abundance of ccs in l483 @xcite implies its earlier evolutionary phase or faster contraction timescale than in the case of l1527 @xcite . according to the previous survey @xcite , the column densities of ccs are 12.3@xmath2110@xmath25  @xmath26 and 5.1@xmath2110@xmath25  @xmath26 toward l483 and l1527 , respectively . although the nh@xmath9/ccs ratio in l483 ( 121 ) is larger than that in l1527 ( 98 ) only by a factor of 1.2 @xcite , the column density of ccs in l483 is larger than l1527 by a factor of 2.4 .",
    "the column density of ccs in iras  15398@xmath33359 is not as high as that in l483 ( n. sakai , in preparation ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the column densities of c@xmath7h in l1527 and iras  15398@xmath33359 are larger by a factor of about 2 than that in l483 @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the heavier depletion of sulfur in l1527 and iras  15398@xmath33359 .",
    "the chemical model calculation by @xcite predicts that ccs is not very abundant in the wccc environment compared with the cold early phase before onset of star - formation .",
    "thus , the higher abundance of ccs in l483 means that its outer envelope would be in a less evolved phase , or close to the `` cold peak '' of chemical evolution @xcite",
    ". the chemical evolutionary phase of l483 would be rather close to those in typical prestellar cores such as l1544 @xcite or chemically young dark cloud cores which are rich in carbon - chain molecules @xcite .",
    "it is also likely that such a difference can be an evidence of variation of contraction and depletion timescale between l483 and other wccc sources .",
    "a similar idea has been proposed for a starless carbon - chain rich core l492 , which is also located in the aquila rift @xcite , as well as for recent survey observations of carbon - chain molecules @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the anti - correlation between ccs and cs could be attributed to the difference in the gas densities traced by these lines .",
    "the critical densities for the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) and cs ( @xmath12=2@xmath31 ) lines are 8@xmath2110@xmath27  @xmath28 and 1.7@xmath2110@xmath29  @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "hence , the vla map of the ccs ( @xmath0=2@xmath11@xmath2 ) line would preferentially trace the outer less - dense regions .    in order to address the issue",
    "whether ccs is not really related to the wccc possibly occurring in deep inside the dense and warm gas in l483 , observations of ccs in higher frequency bands would be required .",
    "for example , the critical densities of the ccs ( @xmath0=7@xmath306@xmath10 , 81  ghz ) and ccs ( @xmath0=8@xmath317@xmath32 , 93  ghz ) lines are 4.2@xmath2110@xmath29  @xmath28 and 6.9@xmath2110@xmath29  @xmath28 , respectively , which can trace almost the same volume of gas as of the cs ( @xmath12=2@xmath31 ) line .",
    "future observations with alma will be able to reveal the high - resolution ccs distributions at the vicinity of the newly born protostar iras  18148 - 0440 , along with the extended outer envelope , thanks to its high dynamic - range imaging capability .",
    "in addition , it would be essential to investigate the distributions of ccs in other prototypical wccc sources , l1527 and iras  15398@xmath33359 , with high resolution observations in order to understand the production mechanism of ccs in the wccc environment .",
    "detailed studies on wccc in comparison with hot corino chemistry are important to understand chemical variation in low - mass star - formation processes followed by planetary formation @xcite .",
    "thus , further high resolution observations , in particular with alma , of variety of longer carbon - chain molecular species including c@xmath4h and c@xmath4h@xmath5 , hc@xmath4n and c@xmath4h@xmath6 , as well as c@xmath4s , will be crucial for l483 and more protostellar cores in order to shed light on the chemical and dynamical evolutionary scheme of low - mass star - formation .",
