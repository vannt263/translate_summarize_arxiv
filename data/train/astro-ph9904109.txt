    "speckle interferometry observations , made just 30 and 38 days after the explosion of supernova sn1987a ( which was first seen on february 23 , 1987 ) , showed evidence for a bright source , separated from the sn by only 60 mas ( nisenson et al , 1987 ) .",
    "this source ( we will call it bs1 ) was seen at least three times : by us 30 and 38 days after the explosion and by ( meikle et al , 1987 ) 50 days after the explosion .",
    "two months later , ( chalabaev et al , 1989 ) detected asymmetries in infrared speckle observations that were in approximately the same north - south direction as bs1 which may have been related to bs1 .",
    "we observed sn1987a again 98 days after the explosion , but the images failed to show conclusive evidence that bs1 was redetected . while at the time , there was much speculation as to plausible mechanisms for the observations ,",
    "see , for example ( rees , 1987 ; piran and nakamura , 1987 ; colgate et al , 1990 ) , no fully satisfactory model was put forward to explain the results . in this paper",
    ", we present a new reconstructed image that shows not only a much cleaner reconstruction of bs1 , but it also shows evidence of a second bright spot on the opposite side of the sn . we will demonstrate that this image is consistent with all the present data if we assume relativistic jets emanating from the the sn .",
    "in addition , two groups have recently suggested that at least some gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) could be explained as highly collimated jets from supernovae ( sne ) ( wang and wheeler , 1998 ; cen , 1998 ) .",
    "a theoretical model for these jets , developed by cen ( cen , 1999 ) to explain grbs is not only consistent with our original observations , but also provides an explanation why bs1 faded by day 98 .",
    "extensive observations of sn1987a were performed over the first two years after the explosion , using the cfa papa detector and speckle interferometry optics with the ctio 4-meter telescope .",
    "details of observing procedures and data reduction are in our earlier papers ( karovska et al , 1989 ; papaliolios et al , 1989 ; karovska et al , 1991 ) .",
    "these observations provided a unique high angular resolution data base on the early history of sn1987a . the changing size and shape of the expanding envelope",
    "was monitored , and substantial asymmetries were detected .",
    "observations of the sn debris with the wf / pc camera and the foc over the last few years have confirmed the accuracy of our measurements of the expansion velocity , as well as the asymmetries in the debris shape and direction of the elongation ( pun , c.s.j .",
    "1995 ; pun , c.s.j 1997 ) .",
    "the direction of polarization ( @xmath0 ) of the sn ( schwarz and mundt , 1987 ) was also found to be close to the direction of elongation of the sn debris as measured by us ( @xmath0 ) , suggesting asymmetries in the expanding debris .",
    "however , our observations of bs1 , that were seen at several wavelengths , 30 and 38 days after the explosion , were viewed with some skepticism , particularly since new observations made two months later did not provide a certain redetection of bs1 .",
    "recently , we went back to the original data and reprocessed them using newer , more sensitive algorithms , to see if anything new could be learned about bs1 that would allow us to understand more about its nature .",
    "the original processing had used the knox - thompson ( kt ) algorithm ( knox and thompson , 1974 ) to recover both the modulus and phase of the image fourier transform , in order to obtain true image reconstructions .",
    "we used a large image magnification in our speckle camera , so that the telescope diffraction limit would be well oversampled .",
    "this resulted in a field of only 1.9 arseconds for the sn observations , which was overfilled by the 2 to 3 arcseconds seeing disk .",
    "for the kt algorithm to work , the individual speckle frames must have a field size that is at least twice the diameter of the seeing disk , so that adjacent frequencies in the fourier transform of each speckle frame are correlated in phase .    in order to meet the kt requirement of field size and seeing disk size , each speckle frame",
    "was multiplied by a gaussian mask which effectively narrowed the `` seeing disk '' to less than one arcsecond .",
    "this allowed the phase to converge in the speckle average , but it also had the deleterious effect of reducing the signal - to - noise ratio in the reconstructions , since all the speckles towards the outside of the mask were discarded .    between the time of our original processing of the data and the present , we have implemented a new image reconstruction algorithm that does not require masking the data with a gaussian .",
    "instead , we generate the speckle autocorrelation using the unmasked data and then apply a modified version of an iterative transform algorithm ( ita ) ( fienup , 1984 ) to find the phase in the fourier transform and produce an image .",
    "the major drawback in the ita method is that there is a @xmath1 ambiguity in the orientation of the reconstruction .",
    "however , the masked kt reconstructions clearly show bs1 , allowing a determination of the orientation and eliminating the ambiguity , despite their poorer snr .",
    "the results of this processing on the sn data are consistent with our earlier kt results but give cleaner reconstructions of bs1 .",
    "in addition , the cleaner images reveal a new feature that we believe could play an important role in understanding not only bs1 but also the geometry of the whole sn system .",
    "figure 1 shows our new reconstruction from the data set taken with a 10 nm wide filter centered on 654 nm ( 10 nm bandpass ) from day 38 . on the left is a false color image and on the right , a contour plot with plate scale and orientation on it .",
    "the 654 nm data were far and away the best for snr of all our observations , since they were aquired with the smallest zenith angle , so the atmospheric dispersion was small , the seeing was the best , and the signal levels were the greatest ( the peak sensitivity of the detector is in the red ) .",
    "the plot shows the lowest 1% contours with a linear display up to 10% , and then has contours at 20 , 40 , 60 and 80% .",
    "it very clearly shows bs1 separated by four pixels from the sn , corresponding to @xmath2 mas angular separation , with a magnitude difference from the sn of @xmath3 magnitudes .",
    "it also reveals a second feature , in - line with bs1 , on the opposite side of the sn , separated by @xmath4 mas and somewhat fainter than bs1 ( a @xmath5 magnitude difference from the sn ) .",
    "we refer to this feature as bs2 . while bs2 is substantially fainter than bs1 , it is well above the noise floor in the new image ( but not in the original kt reconstructions ) .",
    "bs2 is @xmath6 above the background where @xmath7 is the standard deviation calculated from regions adjacent to the images .",
    "there are a few additional point - like peaks in the image that are almost certainly reconstruction noise .",
    "these peaks have a different character from bs1 and bs2 since they do not show the roughly east - west elongation that is seen in the sn , bs1 and bs2 features .",
    "this elongation is due to imperfectly corrected atmospheric dispersion .",
    "the brightest of these other peaks ( north - east of the sn ) is 0.7 magnitude fainter than bs2 , and the other peaks are more than 1 magnitude fainter ( so they fall below the 1% contour level in the plot ) .",
    "these noise peaks are introduced when we deconvolve the sn image with data recorded on a nearby bright , unresolved star , using a wiener filter .",
    "this deconvolution is critical in correcting the speckle interferometry transfer function ( nisenson , 1989 ) . adjusting the wiener filter smooths the image and changes the noise characteristics . for the image in figure 1 ,",
    "the filter was adjusted to cleanly separate bs1 from the sn . if the filter is set so that the high frequencies in the image are reduced , the noise peaks are eliminated .",
    "bs1 and bs2 remain but have a broader shape and bs1 starts to merge with the sn image .",
    "three other data sets were processed in the same way : the images taken on day 38 with filters centered on 533 nm and 450 nm , and the image taken on day 30 , with the filter centered at 654 ( all filters had a 10 nm bandpass ) . the 533 nm image from day 38 and the 654 nm image from day",
    "30 image show the bs1 feature more clearly than the kt reconstructions , but the reconstruction noise does not allow a reliable identification of a feature corresponding to bs2 .",
    "there is a feature in the day 30 image in the location predicted if there were linear motion from the date of the explosion .",
    "however , this image is noisier than the 654 nm day 38 image , and the 2nd spot is at the same level as the reconstruction noise . the day 30 image also shows that the separation of the centroid of bs1 and the sn appears to be about 1 pixel less than the separation in the day 38 image , consistent with linear outward motion of the feature for the 8 day time difference .",
    "the image taken with the 450 filter is very noisy and no reliable identification of even bs1 could be made from it .",
    "we also note that ( miekle et al , 1987 ) detected a bright feature 50 days after the explosion , separated from the sn by 74 @xmath8 8 mas in the same direction as bs1 . assuming their detection and ours",
    "were the same phenomenon , this measurement is also consistent with linear motion .",
    "if we interpret bs1 and bs2 as evidence for a jet and counter - jet , and we assume that the two sources were ejected at the time of the explosion , we can then calculate the geometry of the system .",
    "the distance to sn1987a is nominally 50 kpc . at that distance , the angular separation of bs2 from the sn results in an apparent velocity that is superluminal ( v@xmath9 ) where c is the velocity of light .",
    "this requires that bs2 s velocity is relativistic and that it appears to be superluminal because it has a component of its velocity coming towards us ( blue - shifted ) . since all relativistic velocities saturate at c , it is reasonable to assume the actual velocities of bs1 and bs2 are equal . with that assumption , the equation for the angle to the line of sight , @xmath10 ,",
    "is given by ( pearson et al , 1981 )    @xmath11    where v@xmath12 and v@xmath13 are the apparent velocities ( normalized to c ) of the red - shifted and blue - shifted components , respectively . from the apparent distances of bs1 and bs2 from the sn in figure 1 ,",
    "the known time between the explosion and the observations , and the distance to the sn , we can immediately calculate @xmath10 , the angle that the line joining bs1 , the sn and bs2 makes with the line - of - sight to the supernova .",
    "we can then calculate the actual velocity , @xmath14 , of the components with the formula    @xmath15    in this case , v@xmath12 = @xmath16 and v@xmath13 = @xmath17 .",
    "then , from equation ( 1 ) , @xmath10 is calculated to be @xmath18 from the line - of - sight , and , from equation ( 2 ) , @xmath14 is .80 .",
    "the position angle for bs1 is @xmath19 and for bs2 is @xmath20 .",
    "this result is particularly interesting since hst ( foc ) images of sn1987a recorded in o iii ( 500.7 nm ) show that the sn appears to be at the center of a bipolar nebula in the shape of an hourglass with a bright ring at its waist ( plait et al , 1995 ) .",
    "this ring appears to be centered on the sn and is thought to be the boundary between the red supergiant wind from the earlier stages of the sn progenitor evolution , and the faster wind from the blue supergiant which was the last evolutionary stage before the explosion .",
    "the euv flash from the explosion excited the gas in the ring , and it has been slowly dropping in brightness with time .",
    "the narrow elliptical shape probably indicates that the outflow from the star had a preferential plane ( likely to be the sn equatorial plane ) which is tipped by @xmath21 from the line of sight if one assumes that the ring is circular .",
    "this is not very different from the angle ( @xmath22 ) from the line - of sight that was calculated for the axis along which bs1 , the sn , and bs2 lie . in addition , the position angle on the sky of the minor axis of the ellipse is @xmath23 , close to the position angle of bs1 and bs2 on the sky ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "also , the position angle of the jet is nearly aligned with the direction of elongation of the sn debris .",
    "this is highly suggestive that bs1 and bs2 are within 11 degrees from perpendicularity to the equatorial plane of the sn if that plane is defined by the observed ring . since the blue - shifted spot ( bs2 ) is to the north",
    ", this would imply that southern part of the ring is closer to us .",
    "however , if our geometry is correct , then it conflicts with conclusions drawn from recent measurements made with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ( michael et al , 1998 ) .",
    "they see a blue - shifted hot spot on the northern part of the ring , and a reverse shock from high - speed debris hitting the @xmath25 region inside the ring which is also blue - shifted to the north .",
    "since the hot spot and the higher density material are likely to be in the plane of the ring , this implies that the northern part of the ring is nearer to us .",
    "the geometry implied by the stis measurements makes interpretation of the phenomenon as a polar jet much less likely . as the debris starts to reach the vicinity of the ring and starts to interact with it",
    ", these ambiguities should be resolved .",
    "cen s model ( cen , 1999 ) predicts not only the color dependence and brightness of bs1 and bs2 , but also that their visual brightness would fade in the interval between day 38 and day 98 after the explosion .",
    "his model also shows that the brightness of the jet is proportional to its mass , so the brightness ratio of bs1 and bs2 should be proportional to their mass ratio .",
    "if the intrinsic flux from each component was equal , the lorentz factor would show increased brightness ratio of the blue - shifted component compared to the red - shifted component .",
    "since the measured intensity of bs2 is approximately four times fainter than bs1 , the mass of bs1 must be much greater than the mass of bs2 to compensate for the lorentz effect .",
    "the spectral index of the emission from the jet will also somewhat affect the brightness ratio and thus the mass ratio .",
    "this difference in mass of the two components fits with the model for a supernova jet ( cen , 1998 ) . in his analysis ,",
    "the jet is caused by large asymmetries in supernova explosions , so one might expect unequal masses in the jet and counter - jet .",
    "we are reprocessing additional data , taken 98 - 100 days after the explosion , with our new reconstruction algorithms to see if we can find a feature at the position predicted by the velocity of the jet . by june 1 , 1987 ,",
    "the sn had increased in brightness by almost one magnitude , so even if bs1 had not faded , as predicted , any certain detection will be very difficult because of the expected large magnitude difference from the sn . results of this reprocessing will be published in a subsequent paper .",
