    "after analyzing the results from approximately 5  fb@xmath7 of integrated luminosity at both 7 tev and 8 tev centre - of - mass collision energies , both atlas and cms revealed the discovery of a new resonance in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay channels , consistent with a higgs boson at a mass of approximately 125 gev , with a combined significance of more than @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "now that the remaining 8 tev collision data , corresponding to approximately 20  fb@xmath7 of integrated luminosity , has been analyzed , this new state continues to be consistent with a higgs boson . however , there are indications that its branching ratios might deviate from those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , particularly in the diphoton decay rate that is sensitive to the presence of new physics @xcite .",
    "more data will be needed for precise determination of the branching ratios .",
    "prior to moriond 2013 , both the cms and the atlas experiments found an enhancement in the diphoton signal strength , without significant deviations from sm values in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 signal strengths @xcite . following moriond 2013 ,",
    "cms updated their diphoton analysis with results that were in better agreement with the sm predictions @xcite .",
    "of interest , however , is that atlas @xcite still observes an excess in the diphoton rate at a significance of approximately @xmath14 ; and the atlas diphoton resonance provides a best fit invariant mass for the higgs boson that is larger than the measured resonance mass for the @xmath12 final state ( 126.8 gev versus 124.3 gev ) .    beyond the standard model physics may be significantly constrained by comparing its predictions to the measured mass and the various measured signal strengths ( @xmath15 ) of the higgs - like state . in general ,",
    "vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , vector boson associated production ( vh ) , and the @xmath12/@xmath13 decay modes are sensitive to modifications of the higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons ; top quark associated production ( tth ) and the fermion decay modes are sensitive to modifications of the higgs boson couplings to fermions ; and gluon fusion ( ggf ) and the diphoton ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath16 loop - induced decay modes are sensitive to the presence of new coloured and electrically charged states , respectively , that couple to the higgs boson , as well as modifications to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 couplings .    in general , little higgs models without @xmath19-parity are more highly constrained by precision electroweak measurements than by the lhc higgs results @xcite , while @xmath19-parity models are primarily constrained by relic abundance considerations @xcite and lhc search results @xcite .",
    "the recent non-@xmath19-parity little higgs model of schmaltz , stolarski and thaler , which we will refer to as the blh model @xcite , is not as constrained by precision measurements due to the presence of a custodial symmetry and a disassociation of the masses of the top partner and heavy gauge boson states .",
    "the blh model features a global @xmath20 symmetry that is broken to a diagonal @xmath21 at a scale @xmath22(tev ) when a non - linear sigma field , @xmath23 , develops a vev ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the resulting 15 pseudo - nambu goldstone bosons are parameterized as two real @xmath25 triplets , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , two complex higgs doublets , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and a real singlet @xmath31 . a general two higgs doublet potential",
    "is generated in part explicitly and in part radiatively , where the quartic coupling for the higgs arises when integrating out the heavy scalar singlet , @xmath31 .",
    "a second global symmetry of the form @xmath32 is also present , and is broken to a diagonal @xmath33 at a scale @xmath34 when a second non - linear sigma field , @xmath35 , develops a vev ( @xmath36 ) . to connect these two non - linear sigma models , the @xmath37 and @xmath38 symmetries are gauged with the same @xmath39 gauge bosons , while the @xmath40 and @xmath41 symmetries are gauged with the same @xmath42 gauge bosons .",
    "the diagonal subgroup of @xmath43 is then identified as the standard model @xmath25 . meanwhile ,",
    "the diagonal combination of @xmath44 is gauged by the hypercharge @xmath45 , while leaving the @xmath35 sector unchanged .",
    "this symmetry breaking leads to an extra heavy gauge boson triplet ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , with large squared masses proportional to @xmath48 , which reduces their contribution to precision electroweak observables .",
    "fermions in the blh model , including the newly introduced top partners ( @xmath19 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , only transform under the global @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to top partners with masses proportional only to the scale @xmath54 , lighter than the heavy gauge bosons , and results in a lesser degree of fine tuning than in other little higgs models @xcite .",
    "the blh model has a large parameter space , allowing for a wide range of experimental signatures that could potentially reproduce either the cms or the atlas results .",
    "since the blh model is a type i two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , it also presents the possibility for a near - degeneracy between two or three physical scalar fields ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , which would have a large effect on the measured signal rates of the observed scalar resonance .",
    "in particular , since a cp - odd scalar ( @xmath3 ) boson does not couple directly to pairs of gauge bosons ( @xmath13 and @xmath12 ) , it is possible for a ( nearly ) degenerate cp - odd scalar to contribute to the diphoton rate without affecting these signal strengths .",
    "type i 2hdm are not as strongly affected by meson factory constraints as type ii 2hdm @xcite , and so the near - degenerate case presents a very interesting possibility that we explore in this paper .",
    "although this scenario can lead to an enhancement in @xmath55 , it also leads to a large enhancement in @xmath56 . as we will show",
    ", this effectively rules out the entirety of the near - degenerate scenario .",
    "alternatively , the large number of new vector boson , fermion and scalar fields in the blh model can contribute to the loop - induced production and decay modes of a light higgs boson .",
    "these additional states can also reproduce the observed enhancement of the diphoton rate without significantly affecting the non - loop - induced couplings @xcite . furthermore , mixing between flavour eigenstates in the blh model further leads to modifications of the couplings from the normal sm expressions that can also result in changes to the higgs boson signal strengths .",
    "these three features ( extra higgs states , new gauge and fermion states , modified couplings ) combined lead to the possibility of large variances in the higgs boson signal strength rates , and the potential to reproduce either the atlas or cms measurements .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the higgs results in the blh model , accounting for all production and decay modes explored separately by atlas and cms , in two scenarios : a general case , which assumes the @xmath0 state is light ( @xmath57 gev ) and the masses of the other states ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are allowed to vary , and a second case with a near - degeneracy between the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 fields .",
    "the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 fields are input parameters for the model , while the @xmath2 mass is calculated from these input parameters and from the values of @xmath58 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and @xmath59 ( see eq .",
    "[ derived_params ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 state may or may not be similarly near - degenerate in the latter scenario , depending on the values of the input parameters ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "the reduced @xmath0 contribution results from a suppression of the coupling between the @xmath0 and the @xmath77 boson that occurs for small to moderate values of @xmath303 ( see equation [ eq : ygauge ] for @xmath179 and @xmath185 dependence ) , as seen in the left panel of figure [ fig : rdeg : tbvssapb ] .",

    "this is due entirely to the @xmath56 signal strength ratio , as shown in figure [ fig : rdeg : muyyvsmutata ] .",

    "we allow the mass of the cp - odd scalar to vary between the mass of the light higgs boson and 700 gev .",
    "thus , there is some overlap between the regions of parameter space explored in this and the near - degenerate scenario .",
    "however , since the @xmath70 results exclude the entirety of the near - degenerate scenario , the points of overlap will be greyed out in figures [ fig : norm : tbvssapb ] through [ fig : norm : muwwvsmuzz ] , which are coloured based on @xmath310 .",

    "the favoured large values of @xmath303 for both experimental result sets are understandable in order to achieve @xmath317 , and larger values of @xmath54 reduce the contribution from higher order terms in the expansion of @xmath215 in the couplings .",

    "there is large variation in the @xmath324 and @xmath325 values due to influences from the other fundamental parameters ( such as @xmath54 and the scalar sector parameters ) , and large variations in the total width of the @xmath2 .",
    "this allows for many parameter sets to avoid exclusion , with sufficiently low branching ratio or production rate , or both .",
    "the small region of pure exclusion at approximately @xmath326 and @xmath327  gev occurs due to all parameter points having a sufficiently large production rate and branching ratio for exclusion .",
    "this results in the appearance of an apparently isolated region with a high density of excluded parameter sets .",
    "however , this appearance is simply a result of the two dimensional display of values that depend on multiple degrees of freedom in which the excluded points are displayed as the lowest layer .",

    "this is as expected since significant deviation would also result in significant alterations of the gluon fusion effective coupling to the higgs .",
    "similarly , as shown in figure [ fig : rnorm : muyyvsreshyyg ] ( right panel ) , the contribution from gauge bosons is also sm - like .",
    "the additional heavy gauge bosons of the blh model do not affect the results due to their large mass and suppressed couplings .",
    "any significant alteration of the @xmath341 coupling from its sm value would result in disagreement with the @xmath318 results .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : rnorm : muyyvsreshyys ] shows the most obvious source of enhancement of the diphoton rate , as measured by atlas .",
    "the enhancement occurs when the scalar contribution to the diphoton effective coupling becomes significant , dominated by the contribution from the charged higgs field , @xmath177 .",
    "the dominant component of the diphoton effective coupling comes from the @xmath77 boson loop , which has a negative relative value , as do the contributions from the charged scalars ( @xmath177 , @xmath128 and @xmath127 ) , while the sum of all of the fermion loops contribute positively .",
    "thus , enhancement of the scalar loop contribution increases the effective coupling strength of @xmath342 ( reductions of the contribution from fermion loops would have a similar effect , but are not important here ) .",
    "we have determined that the diphoton enhancement occurs where the @xmath343 coupling becomes large for large values of @xmath184 , corresponding to where @xmath58 is near the the upper boundary of its allowed range as seen in the right panel of figure [ fig : rnorm : tbvsma0 ] .",
    "this region lies close to the border of perturbativity constraints , as discussed in eq .",
    "[ eq : tbmax ] .",
    "figure [ fig : rnorm : hmuyy1vsamuyy1 ] also shows several parameter points which fit the data well but do not have a significant scalar loop contribution to the diphoton effective coupling .",
    "these points correspond to a moderate contribution to the diphoton rate from the production of the cp - odd scalar at masses above 300 gev .",
    "this is an artifact of the method we use for calculating , which determines an inclusive ( @xmath344 ) cross section , but excludes parameter sets only for which the heavier resonances would be distinguishable at 95% c.l .",
    "in other words , if the heavier resonances do not result in an exclusion , they contribute to the total cross section calculated .",
    "little information was given by the experiments regarding any invariant mass windowing incorporated into the determination of the diphoton excess , and so we chose an inclusive cross section calculation .        with regards to the other parameters in the model , particularly the heavy quark mixing angles , @xmath345 and @xmath346 , and heavy gauge boson mixing angle , @xmath217",
    ", no constraints can be placed with the existing data .",
    "this is because these states do not get a large component of their mass from the higgs vacuum expectation value , and so they do not contribute significantly to the loop factors . in figure [ fig : norm : flvsmt6 ] , we show , as an example , the @xmath53 mass versus @xmath54 .",
    "the only constraint that can be determined is an overall mass constraint arising directly from the constraint on @xmath54 . in particular , the minimum heavy quark mass as determined from the higgs data is approximately 300 gev - the precise value of which is unimportant , as direct constraints from pair production searches for heavy vector - like quarks rule out much heavier states @xcite .",
    "the blh model provides , in principle , a rich source of phenomenology .",
    "apart from incorporating a two higgs doublet model , it includes additional scalar triplets , heavy gauge bosons , and a set of six new heavy quarks . in this paper , we have investigated whether the model includes parameter sets that are consistent with the higgs boson signal strength ratios recently measured by the cms and atlas experiments .",
    "we have used a couple of @xmath293 measures , one to compare the fit of the blh model to the data relative to that of a sm fit and another to identify regions of blh model parameter space favoured by the results of the two experiments .",
    "as described above , we have found that the blh model can reproduce the results of either experiment but primarily via modifications to the couplings of top quarks to the higgs states and through the contributions of additional scalar states in the context of a 2hdm . as a 2hdm ,",
    "the blh model provides two possible scenarios : the general case in which a single higgs state dominates contributions to the signal strength ratios , and the near - degenerate case in which multiple higgs states contribute to the observed results .    at this time , the experimental data remains statistically limited and there remain discrepancies between the central values of the cms and atlas results .",
    "however , using the full set of measured signal strength ratios , we find that the blh model in the near - degenerate scenario is a worse fit to the data of each experiment than is the sm for almost all parameter sets . this is a consequence of a large enhancement of the @xmath56 signal strength by the contribution of the cp - odd scalar state nearly degenerate with the light higgs boson . in this scenario , for parameter sets",
    "consistent with the observed diphoton rates , @xmath56 is predicted to be three to five times larger than its sm value , and several sigma larger than the value measured by cms or atlas .",
    "consequently , a precise measurement of @xmath56 will be sufficient to exclude the near - degenerate scenario in the blh model .",
    "on the other hand , large regions of the general blh parameter space provide a better fit to the experimental results than does the sm .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath311 in order to achieve @xmath317 , while @xmath313 gev is necessary such that higher order corrections in the expansion in @xmath215 do not reduce couplings between the @xmath347 quark and @xmath0 , and the @xmath77 boson and @xmath0 .",
    "a cp - odd scalar mass of @xmath348 gev is favoured , resulting in a value of @xmath56 that is consistent with the sm .",
    "these rather general constraints provide good agreement with the cms diphoton results , allowing a large range of @xmath58 and @xmath322 values .",
    "the signal strength ratios are produced primarily through the light higgs boson with approximately sm - like couplings .    due to the enhancement of the overall scalar and cp - odd scalar production for @xmath349  gev , much of this region of parameter space",
    "is already directly ruled out at 95% c.l . by heavy higgs searches in the @xmath335 and @xmath8 channels .",
    "additionally , all parameter regions of the blh model predict the values of @xmath318 and @xmath350 to be similar , such that the entirety of the blh model would be excluded if the difference in the @xmath350 and @xmath318 results becomes statistically significant to the degree currently measured by atlas .",
    "it is possible to reproduce the atlas @xmath55 measurement with a sm - like @xmath56 in the blh model , but for a restricted space of parameter sets .",
    "the physical origin of the enhancement of the diphoton rate is a significant enhancement of the charged higgs field ( @xmath177 ) contribution to the diphoton loop .",
    "the diphoton enhancement occurs for maximal values of @xmath58 , where the @xmath343 coupling becomes large .",
    "more accurate measurements , including the @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath16 final states , with higher luminosity will be crucial to determining the status of the blh model , and for determining the values of the scalar sector parameters .",
    "the 2hdm sector of the blh model is likely its most accessible aspect , with fairly light cp - odd and , consequently , charged higgs states allowed .",
    "discovery and measurement of heavy quark partners can lead to further constraints on the value of the scale @xmath54 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , in the blh model , measurements of the mass and branching ratios of the lightest heavy quark partner is insufficient to significantly constrain the value of @xmath54 , due to the presence of degenerate states and the involvement of the two mixing angles , @xmath268 and @xmath269 . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that measurement of several of the heavy quark masses is needed to isolate the value of the scale @xmath54 from the values of the heavy quark mixing angles .",
