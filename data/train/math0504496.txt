    "in the abundant literature about planar brownian motion , there are certainly results dealing with the question of area .",
    "paul lvy s stochastic area formula describing the algebraic area `` swept '' by a brownian motion will likely come to the mind of many readers .",
    "our result , however , is very different from this classical theorem , firstly because levy s area is a signed area , but mainly because of the following : in order to apprehend lvy s area it is enough to follow the brownian curve locally without paying attention to the rest of the curve . in our case",
    ", one needs to consider the curve globally .    aside from the fact that the question we address is a very natural one for brownian motion ,",
    "we have been motivated by related results in the physics literature . in @xcite , using methods of conformal field theory , cardy has shown that the ratio of the expected area enclosed by a self - avoiding polygon of perimeter @xmath8 to the expected squared radius of gyration for a polygon of perimeter @xmath8 converges as @xmath9 goes to infinity to @xmath10 .",
    "we note that self - avoiding polygons are supposed to have the same asymptotic shape as filled brownian loops ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . however , studying this relationship is hard basically for the following reason .",
    "the boundary of the brownian loop is of @xmath11-type , but , unfortunately , there does not exist a good way of `` talking about the length '' of @xmath4 curves at this moment .",
    "our result gives interesting information regarding the brownian loop soups introduced in @xcite .",
    "this conformally invariant object plays an important role in the understanding and description of @xmath4 curves ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it can be viewed as a poissonian cloud ( of intensity @xmath12 ) of _ filled _ brownian loops in subdomains of the plane . among other things",
    ", it is announced in @xcite that the dimension of the set of points in the complement of the loop soup ( i.e. the points that are in the inside of no loop ) can be shown to be equal to @xmath13 , using consequences of the restriction property .",
    "a detailed proof of this statement has never been published , and in fact , our result implies the corresponding first moment estimate ( i.e. the mean number of balls of radius @xmath14 needed to cover the set ) .",
    "the other arguments needed to derive the result announced in @xcite will be detailed in @xcite .",
    "let us make precise what we mean by area enclosed by a brownian loop .",
    "let @xmath15 denote a brownian bridge in @xmath16 of time duration 1 .",
    "i.e. the law of @xmath17 is the same as the law of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is just a standard brownian motion in @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath20 $ ] , i.e. the complement of the path , has a unique infinite connected component @xmath21 .",
    "the hull @xmath22 generated by the brownian loop is by definition @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the random variable whose value is the area of @xmath22 . in this paper",
    ", we will prove    [ main ] @xmath25    we would like to explain now how this result is related to the problem of windings of a brownian loop . in @xcite , yor gave an explicit formula for the law of the index of a brownian loop around a fixed point @xmath26 .",
    "a point with a non - zero index has to be inside the loop .",
    "using this fact , it is almost possible to describe the probability that a point is inside the loop , modulo the problem of the zero index ; indeed , there are some regions inside the brownian loop which are of index zero .",
    "it seems hard to control the influence of these zero - index points inside the curve . in the last section , using our main result , theorem  [ main ] , combined with the law of the index given by yor , we find that the expected area of the set of points inside the loop that have index zero is @xmath27 .",
    "we also compute the expected areas of the regions of index @xmath28 .",
    "in @xcite , using physics methods , contet , desbois and ouvry obtained the values of the expected areas for the non - zero regions . in their paper , they noted the different nature of the @xmath29 sector ( the points in the plane of zero index ) and emphasized that `` it would be interesting to distinguish in the @xmath29 sector , curves which do not enclose the origin from curves which do enclose the origin but an equal number of times clockwise and anticlockwise '' .",
    "their values in the case @xmath30 agree with our results ; they argue that the 0-case can not be treated within the scope of their analysis .    from a probabilistic viewpoint",
    ", it also appears that usual techniques for brownian motion are not strong enough to obtain the expected area of the brownian loop or the expected area of the 0-index region inside the brownian loop .",
    "however , the computation of the expected area of the @xmath9-index region for @xmath31 was within reach using the result of yor . to our knowledge",
    "this computation had not been carried out in a mathematical way before .",
    "let us briefly explain why usual techniques for brownian motion seem unable to tackle the problem of the expected area of the brownian loop .",
    "basically , the enclosed area depends only on the boundary of the hull generated by the brownian loop .",
    "the frontier of the brownian loop concerns only a small subset of the time duration @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "in some sense , on certain time - intervals , the enclosed area does not depend much on the behavior of the brownian motion .",
    "so , this problem needs a good description of the frontier of a brownian loop .",
    "recently , lawler , schramm and werner proved a conjecture of mandelbrot that the hausdorff dimension of the brownian frontier is @xmath33 .",
    "for this purpose they used the value of intersection exponents computed with the help of @xmath4 curves , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "the description of the brownian frontier via @xmath4 can be done in a slightly different way using the conformal - restriction point of view , see @xcite .",
    "we will use this approach , and so will present to the reader the facts needed about conformal restriction measures in the next section .",
    "the paper gives another striking example of a simple result concerning planar brownian motion that seemed out of reach using the usual stochastic calculus approach , but that can be derived using conformal invariance and @xmath4 .",
    "for a thorough account on @xmath4 processes , see @xcite .",
    "conformal restriction measures in @xmath34 are measures supported on the set of closed subsets @xmath35 of @xmath34 such that @xmath36 , @xmath35 is unbounded and @xmath37 has two infinite connected components , that satisfy the conformal restriction property : for all simply connected domains @xmath38 such that @xmath39 is bounded and bounded away from the origin , the law of @xmath35 conditioned on @xmath40 is the law of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is any conformal transformation from @xmath21 to @xmath34 preserving @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( this law does nt depend of the choice of @xmath42 ) . it is proved in @xcite that there is only one real parameter family of such restriction measures , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "these measures are uniquely described by the following property : for all closed @xmath47 in @xmath34 bounded and bounded away from @xmath43 , @xmath48=\\phi_a^{\\,'}(0)^{{\\alpha}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a conformal transformation from @xmath50 into @xmath34 such that @xmath51 , when @xmath52 . to aid with the notation for the rest of the paper",
    "whenever we write @xmath53 we will be assuming that we have chosen the translate with the additional property @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is the law of chordal @xmath56 , and @xmath57 can be constructed by filling the closed loops of a brownian excursion in @xmath34 ( brownian motion started at @xmath43 conditioned to stay in @xmath34 ) .",
    "an important property of these conformal restriction measures is that using two independent restriction measures @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we can construct @xmath60 by filling the `` inside '' of the union of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this `` additivity '' property and the construction of @xmath55 and @xmath57 give the good description of the brownian motion in terms of @xmath4 curves , namely , 8 @xmath56 give the same hull as 5 brownian excursions .",
    "since , we want to describe the boundary of loops of time duration 1 , we will first create loops with the use of the infinite hulls described above .",
    "restriction measures are conformally invariant ( brownian excursion , @xmath56 , .. ) , so we had better use conformal maps .",
    "there is obviously no conformal map which sends both @xmath44 and 0 to 0 , so the natural idea is to consider a mbius transformation preserving @xmath34 which maps 0 to 0 , and @xmath44 to @xmath14 .",
    "we can choose @xmath63 @xmath64 the limit when @xmath14 goes to zero of the measures @xmath65 is the dirac measure at @xmath66 .",
    "the good renormalization to keep something interesting is in @xmath67 .",
    "hence , we define the brownian bubble measure in @xmath34 as : @xmath68    this measure was introduced in @xcite , and it is an important tool for studying the link between @xmath4 curves and the brownian loop soup ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was already noted in @xcite , as an easy consequence of the `` additivity '' property described above , that @xmath69 the last measure can be seen as an infinite measure on ",
    "@xmath56 loops \" , let us call this measure @xmath70 . recall , that we are interested in a brownian loop of time duration 1 .",
    "we have the following time decomposition for @xmath71 , ( see @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the law of a _ one - dimensional _ brownian bridge of time duration @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the law of an it brownian excursion re - normalized to have time @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath76 is the law of an @xmath34-brownian bridge of time duration @xmath74 , by considering the one dimensional bridge as the @xmath77 coordinate of the curve , and the excursion as the @xmath78 coordinate .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to compute fixed - time quantities with @xmath4 techniques .",
    "thus , we will compute a  geometric quantity \" using @xmath56 , and then extract @xmath79 from this geometric value by using the relation @xmath80 and the decomposition  [ decomp ] .",
    "let us explain in a few words why we need to deal with brownian bridges in @xmath34 and can not work directly with bridges in @xmath16 .",
    "the underlying idea is the fact that one needs to choose a starting point on the boundary of the brownian loop for the @xmath4 loop representation .",
    "a natural choice is the ( almost surely ) unique lower point , this is why we are interested in @xmath34 quantities .",
    "so let @xmath81 be the random variable giving the area of an @xmath82brownian bridge of time duration one .",
    "working with @xmath81 will turn out not to be a problem since , as the reader might already suspect , the random variables @xmath83 and @xmath84 have the same law .    for the geometric quantity",
    ", we could choose to compute @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the area enclosed in @xmath34 by the  curve \" @xmath87 , but this integral is infinite .",
    "let @xmath88 be the radius of the curve @xmath87 , that is , @xmath89 .",
    "we may consider the  expected \" area under the law @xmath70  conditioned \" on @xmath90 .",
    "here , @xmath70 is not a probability measure so the term  expected value \" is not correct , and the conditioning is on a set of @xmath91measure equal to 0 .",
    "but we have the following rigorous definition : @xmath92 using @xmath93 , we can write in the same way : @xmath94 thus , @xmath95 represents at the same time the  expected \" area of an @xmath56 loop conditioned to touch the half circle of radius one and the expected area of a brownian bubble with the same conditioning . with the use of the restriction property for @xmath56 , we will be able to compute in the last section @xmath95 .",
    "before , in the coming section , we will find the relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath95 .",
    "in this section we will prove the following    [ extraction ] @xmath96    first of all , by using the definition of @xmath71 in terms of @xmath97 and the restriction property of @xmath57 , it is easy to show that @xmath98 , hence @xmath99 and thus , from , we have @xmath100 here @xmath101 is the expectation according to the law of an @xmath34-brownian bridge in time @xmath74 . by brownian scaling we have @xmath102 therefore : @xmath103 using the change of variables @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 be the density on @xmath106 of the random variable @xmath88 under the @xmath34-brownian bridge of time duration one .",
    "as for the one dimensional bridge ( law of the maximum of the bridge ) , this density decays exponentially fast at infinity .",
    "thus , we can interchange the limit and the integral to obtain : @xmath107 hence , the proof of the lemma will be concluded as soon as we establish @xmath108 there is a ( almost sure ) one to one correspondence between @xmath16-brownian bridges and @xmath34-brownian bridges .",
    "the idea is to start the brownian loop from its lowest point .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath109 is a brownian bridge in @xmath16 , with probability one , there is a unique @xmath110 $ ] such that @xmath111 , for all @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "we associate to the brownian bridge @xmath113 the process @xmath114 in @xmath115 , defined by this simple space - time translation : @xmath116 now , we have to identify the law of @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath113 are two independent one - dimensional brownian bridges .",
    "the law of the random variable @xmath119 is independent of @xmath120 , so in the space - time change [ vv ] , @xmath121 is still a one - dimensional bridge independent of the imaginary part of @xmath117 . @xmath122 has the law of a one - dimensional brownian bridge viewed from its ( almost sure ) unique lowest point . by the vervaat theorem ( see @xcite ) , this gives the law of an it excursion renormalized to have time one .",
    "thus @xmath117 has the law of an @xmath34-brownian bridge of time one .",
    "our space - time transformation obviously preserves the area , hence @xmath123 .",
    "in this section we prove lemma [ comp ] , the proof provides a good example of the use of standard techniques for @xmath56 .",
    "we have chosen to leave out some algebraic details in order to allow the reader to focus on the main ideas .    [ comp ]",
    "@xmath124    note that theorem  [ main ] follows immediately from this lemma and lemma  [ extraction ] .",
    "recall : @xmath125 by using the definition @xmath126 we can rewrite [ ad ] as : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a more appealing notation for the expected value under the law of @xmath129 ( this law , in simpler words , is the law of a chordal @xmath56 in @xmath34 from 0 to @xmath14 ) .",
    "recall that @xmath86 is the area of the bounded set in @xmath34 enclosed by the curve @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath86 can be written as @xmath130 , where \\{@xmath26 inside } means that @xmath26 is in the component bounded by @xmath87 .",
    "thus can be written as : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is @xmath133 . since everything is nicely bounded , we can interchange the limits and the integral .",
    "this gives us : @xmath134    therefore , what remains to be done is to compute , for a fixed z , the  probability \" that this @xmath26 is inside an  @xmath56 loop \" conditioned to have radius exactly 1 .",
    "so let us fix @xmath135 in @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath136 ( resp @xmath137 ) denote the image under @xmath138 of the set @xmath139 ( resp @xmath140 ) .",
    "we warn the reader that @xmath87 will denote two different kinds of curves in @xmath34 : a curve from 0 to @xmath44 , or a curve from @xmath43 to @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath141 be the event @xmath142 , and , similarly , let @xmath143 be the analogous event for @xmath144 .",
    "then , @xmath145 recall that @xmath55 is the law of a chordal @xmath11 from 0 to @xmath44 in @xmath34 , henceforth , we will simply call it @xmath146 . in order to make the formulas more concise",
    "we will denote the event @xmath147 by @xmath148 .",
    "then , @xmath149 the reason for this last step is that now all the probabilities involved can be computed using the _ restriction _",
    "property for @xmath11 , and a simple formula , see lemma [ l.1 ] , for the probability that a point is to the right of an @xmath56 path from 0 to @xmath44 in @xmath34 .",
    "this requires ( cf . section  [ preliminaries ] ) to know the unique conformal map @xmath150 from @xmath151 into @xmath34 , with @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( with a similar statement for @xmath137 ) .",
    "thus by restriction , the law of the chordal @xmath56 in @xmath34 conditioned not to touch @xmath136 is the inverse image of the chordal @xmath4 in @xmath34 by @xmath155 .",
    "this implies for the quantities we need to compute : @xmath156 note that @xmath157 is a mbius transformation , which maps @xmath44 to @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , @xmath136 and @xmath137 are half disks whose centers are very close to -1 .",
    "the fact that they are not exactly centered at -1 is due to the lack of symmetry in the problem : an @xmath4 from 0 to @xmath14 in a half disk @xmath132 centered in 0 . nevertheless , for the computation of @xmath159 and @xmath160 , we can think of @xmath136 and @xmath137 as two half disks centered at -1 with radii respectively @xmath14 and @xmath161 . if we carried out the computations with the actual disks ( straightforward but tedious ) , we would see that our approximation is of order @xmath162 , when @xmath26 goes to -1 .",
    "in this way , we have @xmath163 we now have to evaluate these functions at the point @xmath164 ( recall @xmath165 is fixed ) .",
    "the approximations @xmath166 and @xmath167 at the point @xmath168 are of order @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively ; this gives us : @xmath171 using the taylor series for the logarithm , and then taking the imaginary part , we see that @xmath172 now , using lemma [ l.1 ] , and the taylor series for cosine we see that @xmath173 + o({\\varepsilon}^2\\delta ^2 + { \\varepsilon}^3).\\ ] ] in particular , if we set @xmath174 we obtain , @xmath175 also , by , we have ( our approximation does nt change significantly the derivative at 0 which is far away from small disks centered at -1 ) : @xmath176 similarly , @xmath177 , which gives @xmath178    hence , by combining this last expression , [ kk ] , [ pro ] , [ kkk ] and using the fact that both @xmath179 and @xmath180 are @xmath181 , we obtain : @xmath182    therefore , by , and using polar coordinates to evaluate the integral , we get : @xmath183 this concludes the proof of the lemma .",
    "below we state a result that we have used extensively in our proof ; for the reader s sake we will sketch a proof .",
    "this lemma gives an equivalent expression to the one given by schramm , in @xcite .",
    "[ l.1 ] let @xmath87 be chordal @xmath184 in @xmath34 with @xmath185 , and let @xmath186 be a point in @xmath34 . if we let @xmath187 then @xmath188 , which by scaling depends only on @xmath189 , is given by @xmath190 in particular , for @xmath191 : @xmath192    _ ( sketch ) _    as already mentioned , by scale invariance of @xmath4 , the probability that a point @xmath193 is to the right of the curve only depends on the angle @xmath189 .",
    "thus , this probability is a certain function @xmath188 of the angle @xmath189 . @xmath4",
    "curves satisfy also a conformal - type markov property .",
    "thus , if @xmath194 is the unique conformal map from @xmath195 $ ] onto @xmath34 satisfying @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 , we get : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the continuous argument of @xmath201 .",
    "this shows that @xmath202 is a martingale in @xmath203 . using that",

    "we want this process to be a martingale , so the @xmath211 term in the expression for @xmath212 has to be 0 .",
