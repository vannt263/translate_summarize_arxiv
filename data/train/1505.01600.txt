    "the gravitational two - body problem is a fundamental issue in general relativity .",
    "this also attracts great interest in gravitational wave physics because binary inspirals are promising sources of gravitational waves which are expected to be detected directly by ongoing gravitational wave observatories in the world . understanding the dynamics of binary system",
    "is required to predict the emitted gravitational waveforms accurately for efficient searches of the signal in observed data .",
    "one of major approaches for this purpose is the gravitational self - force ( gsf ) picture in the black hole perturbation theory . in this picture ,",
    "a binary is regarded as a point mass orbiting a black hole and the dynamics can be described by the equation of motion of the mass including the effect of the interaction with the self - field , that is , the gsf .",
    "after the formal expression of the gsf was presented by mino , sasaki and tanaka @xcite and quinn and wald @xcite , a lot of efforts have been devoted to develop practical formulations and methods to calculate the gsf ( for example , refer to @xcite for the formulation of gsf , @xcite for the recent progress in practical calculations of gsf ) .",
    "although a lot of progress has been made , however , it is still challenging to calculate the gsf directly for general orbits , especially in kerr spacetime .",
    "practical calculations of the gsf with high accuracy will require a huge amount of time and computer resources mainly because of the regularization problem induced by the point mass limit .",
    "therefore it is important to develop a way to reduce the cost of computing the gsf .",
    "the two - timescale expansion method @xcite gives a hint for it : assuming that a point mass does not encounter any transient resonances ( _ e.g. _ shown in @xcite ) , the orbital phase , which is the most important information to predict the waveform , can be expressed in the expansion with respect to the mass ratio , @xmath12 , as @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are quantities of order unity . the leading term , @xmath14 , can be calculated from the knowledge up to the time - averaged dissipative piece of the first order gsf , corresponding to the secular growth .",
    "the calculation of this secular contribution can be simplified significantly by using the radiative field defined as half the retarded solution minus half the advanced solution for the equation of the gravitational perturbation @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the adiabatic approximation method , because the radiative field is the homogeneous solution free from the divergence induced by the point mass limit .",
    "this method allows us to calculate the leading term accurately without spending huge computational resources . on the other hand",
    ", the calculation of @xmath15 requires the rest of the first order gsf ( the oscillatory part of the dissipative gsf and the conservative gsf ) and the time - averaged dissipative piece of the second order gsf .",
    "there is no simplification in calculating these post-1 adiabatic pieces at present .",
    "since @xmath15 is subleading , however , the requirement of the accuracy is not so high compared to that of the leading term .",
    "this fact suggests that it is possible to reduce the computational cost by using a suitable method with an appropriate error tolerance to calculate each piece of the gsf ( for example , a hybrid approach is proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "in this work , we focus on the time - averaged dissipative part of the first order gsf , which has the dominant contribution to the evolution of inspirals , and present the analytic post - newtonian ( pn ) formulae .",
    "so far , several works in this direction had been done for two restricted classes of orbits : circular orbits and equatorial orbits .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein for early works in 1990 s ) .",
    "recently , thanks to the progress of computer technology , the very higher order post - newtonian calculations can be possible for circular equatorial orbits : the 22pn calculation of the energy flux is demonstrated in schwarzschild case @xcite , and the 11pn calculation in kerr case @xcite .",
    "there is also the calculation of the secular gsf effects for slightly eccentric and slightly inclined ( non - equatorial ) orbits @xcite , and later it had been extended to orbits with arbitrary inclination @xcite , where the pn formulae of the secular gsf effects are presented in the expansion with respect to the orbital eccentricity .",
    "however , the calculation in @xcite has been done only up to the 2.5pn order with the second order correction of the eccentricity .",
    "also the absorption to the black hole is ignored there .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to update the results in @xcite up to the 4pn order and the sixth order correction of the eccentricity , including the effect of the absorption to the black hole .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : review ] , we give a brief review of the geodesic motion of a point particle in kerr spacetime , the gravitational perturbations induced by the particle , and the adiabatic approximation method of calculating the secular effect of the gsf . in sec.[sec : dote_formulae ] , we present the pn formulae of the secular changes of the the energy , azimuthal angular momentum , and carter parameter of the particle due to the gravitational radiation reaction in the expansion with respect to the orbital eccentricity . in sec.[sec : compare ] , we investigate the accuracy of our pn formulae by comparing to numerical results given by the method in @xcite , which can give each modal flux at the accuracy about 14 significant figures . in sec.[sec :",
    "exp - resum ] , we implement a resummation method to the pn formulae given in this work in order to improve the accuracy . in sec.[sec : delta_n ] , we discuss the convergence of the analytic formulae as the pn expansion and the expansion with respect to the eccentricity .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper in sec.[sec : summary ] . for the readability of the main text",
    ", we present the pn formulae for the orbital parameters , the fundamental frequencies , the orbital motion in appendices [ app : variable_exp ] and [ app : coeff_orbit ] , which are used in calculating the secular changes of the orbital parameters .",

    "we use metric signature @xmath16 and `` geometrized '' units with @xmath17 .",
    "the orbital evolution of a point particle due to the time - averaged dissipative part of the gsf is often described in terms of the secular changes of the orbital parameters . in order to calculate the changes ,",
    "we need the information on the first order gravitational perturbations induced by the particle when it moves along the background geodesics . in this section , we review the geodesic dynamics of a point particle in kerr spacetime , the gravitational perturbations induced by the particle , and the adiabatic evolution of the orbital parameters .      the kerr metric in the boyer - lindquist coordinates , @xmath18 ,",
    "is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mass and angular momentum of the black hole , respectively .",
    "there are two killing vectors related to the stationarity and axisymmetry of kerr spacetime , which are expressed as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , it is known that kerr spacetime possesses a killing tensor , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the kinnersley s null vectors given by @xmath29 for the geodesic motion of a particle in kerr geometry , there are three constants of motion related to the symmetries : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the four velocity of the particle . @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the specific energy and azimuthal angular momentum of the particle respectively .",
    "@xmath34 is called as the carter constant , which corresponds to the square of the specific total angular momentum in schwarzschild case .",

    "one can recover the expressions in the standard units as @xmath36 there is another definition of the carter constant , @xmath37 , which vanishes for equatorial orbits . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath38 as one of the orbital parameters , instead of @xmath39 .    by using these constants of motion ,",
    "the geodesic equations can be expressed in the following form as @xmath40 where we introduced a new parameter @xmath41 through the relation @xmath42 , and some functions as @xmath43 ^ 2-\\delta[r^2+(a\\hat{e}-\\hat{l})^2+\\hat{c } ] , \\\\",

    "does not depend on the initial position .",
    "hence we do not need the information on the initial position to describe the secular evolution of the orbit at the order considered in this paper . ] in the case of a bound orbit , we can use an alternative set of parameters , @xmath45 , instead of @xmath44 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the values of @xmath48 at the periapsis and apoapsis and @xmath49 is the minimal value of @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "using this set of parameters , we can describe the range in which the motion takes place as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "there is another useful choice of parameters used in @xcite , @xmath53 , defined by @xmath54 by analogy to the parametrization used in celestial mechanics , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath55 are referred as semi - latus rectum , orbital eccentricity , orbital inclination angle , respectively . for later convenience",
    ", we also introduce @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "since @xmath58 corresponds to the magnitude of the orbital velocity , it can be used as the post - newtonian parameter .",
    "for example , we call the @xmath59-correction from the leading order as the fourth order post - newtonian ( 4pn ) correction .    it is worth noting that , by introducing @xmath41 , the radial and longitudinal equations of motion in eq.([eq : eom_r_theta ] ) , are completely decoupled . for an bound orbit , therefore , the radial and longitudinal motions are periodic with the periods , @xmath60 , defined by @xmath61 this means that these motions can be expressed in terms of fourier series as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the radial and longitudinal frequencies given by @xmath65 and we choose the initial values so that @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "on the other hand , it is not the case if the ratio is rational , _",
    "i.e. _ the resonance case .",
    "this implies that the secular evolution of a resonant orbit can not be described only by the pn formulae derived in this work @xcite . ]    since the temporal and azimuthal equations of motion in eq.([eq : eom_t_phi ] ) are divided into the @xmath48- and @xmath50-dependent parts , the solutions can be divided into three parts : the linear term with respect to @xmath41 , the oscillatory part with period of @xmath69 , and the oscillatory part with period of @xmath70 .",

    "( [ eq : edot])-([eq : cdot ] ) can be divided into the infinity part and the horizon part : the former consists of the terms including the amplitudes of the partial waves at the infinity , @xmath106 , the latter consists of the terms including the amplitudes at the horizon , @xmath107 . as for the energy and",

    "<S> we calculate the secular changes of the orbital parameters of a point particle orbiting a kerr black hole , due to the gravitational radiation reaction . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we use the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation in the first order black hole perturbation theory , with the expansion with respect to the orbital eccentricity . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is done up to the fourth post - newtonian ( 4pn ) order and to the sixth order of the eccentricity , including the effect of the absorption of gravitational waves by the black hole . we confirm that , in the kerr case , the effect of the absorption appears at the 2.5pn order beyond the leading order in the secular change of the particle s energy and may induce a superradiance , as known previously for circular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the superradiance may be suppressed when the orbital plane inclines with respect to the equatorial plane of the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the accuracy of the 4pn formulae by comparing to numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> if we require that the relative errors in the 4pn formulae are less than @xmath0 , the parameter region to satisfy the condition will be @xmath1 for @xmath2 , @xmath3 for @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for @xmath6 almost irrespective of the inclination angle nor the spin of the black hole , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the semi - latus rectum and the eccentricity of the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the region can further be extended using an exponential resummation method to @xmath9 for @xmath2 , @xmath10 for @xmath4 , and @xmath11 for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> although we still need the higher order calculations of the pn approximation and the expansion with respect to the orbital eccentricity to apply for data analysis of gravitational waves , the results in this paper would be an important improvement from the previous work at the 2.5pn order , especially for large @xmath7 region . </S>"
