    "the classical source  filter theory of vowel production is built on the assumption that the source ( i.e. , the vocal fold vibration ) operates independently of the filter ( i.e. , the vocal tract , henceforth vt ) whose resonances modulate the resulting vowel sound @xcite . even though this approach captures a wide range of phenomena in speech production , at least in male speakers ,",
    "some observations remain unexplained by the source  filter model lacking feedback .",
    "the purpose of this article is to deal with some of these observations using computational modelling .",
    "more precisely , simulated rising and falling frequency glides of vowels [ ] and [ ] over the frequency range @xmath1}$ ] are considered .",
    "similar glides recorded from eleven female test subjects are treated in the companion article @xcite .",
    "such a vowel glide is particularly interesting if its glottal frequency ( @xmath0 ) range intersects an isolated acoustic resonance of the supra- or subglottal cavity , which we here assume to correspond to the lowest formant @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath3 almost always lies high above @xmath0 in adult male phonation , this situation occurs typically in female subjects and only when they are producing vowels such as [ ] with low @xmath3 .",
    "as reported below , simulations reveal ( in addition to other observations ) a characteristic locking behaviour of @xmath0 at the vt acoustic resonance are understood here as purely mathematical objects , determined by an acoustic pde and its boundary conditions that are defined on the vt geometry .",
    "formants @xmath11 refer to respective frequency peaks extracted from natural or simulated speech . here , the notation of @xcite is used to differentiate the two although , of course , we expect to have @xmath12 for @xmath13 . ]",
    "@xmath14 . to check the robustness of the model observations ,",
    "secondary features of the model and the role of unmodelled physics are discussed at the end of the article . as a matter of fact",
    ", this article has two equally important objectives .",
    "firstly , we pursue better understanding of the time - domain dynamics of glottal pulse perturbations near @xmath2 of [ ] and at other acoustic `` hot spots '' of the vt and the subglottal system within @xmath15}$ ] that may be reached in speech or singing .",
    "an acoustic and flow - mechanical model of the speech apparatus is a well - suited tool for this purpose .",
    "secondly , we introduce and validate a computational model that meets these requirements .",
    "the proposed model has been originally designed to be a glottal pulse source for high - resolution 3d computational acoustics model of the vt which is being developed for medical purposes @xcite .",
    "there is an emerging application for this model as a development platform of speech signal processing algorithms such as discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; however , the model introduced in @xcite has been used in @xcite . since perturbations of @xmath0 near @xmath3 are a widely researched , yet quite multifaceted phenomenon , it is a good candidate for model validation experiments .",
    "the simulations carried out in this paper indicate special kinds of perturbations in vocal folds vibrations near a vt resonance as reported below .",
    "the mere existence of such perturbations is not surprising considering the wide range of existing literature . since the seminal work of @xcite ,    a wide range of glottal source perturbation patterns related to acoustic loading has been investigated .",
    "experiments were carried out in @xcite on excised larynges mounted on a resonator to determine how glottal amplitude ratio changes with the subglottal resonator length .",
    "physical models were used in @xcite with a subglottal resonator to study phonation onsets and offsets , and in @xcite with sub- and supraglottal resonators to study phonation onsets .",
    "the latter also considered the dynamics of frequency jumps as the natural frequency of their physical model was varied over time .",
    "similarly , a physical model of phonation with tubular , variable length supraglottal resonator was studied in @xcite , and it was used to validate a flow - acoustic model somewhat resembling the one proposed in this article .    in @xcite",
    "the problem was approached using both reasoning based on sub- and supraglottal impedances and a non - computational flow model as well as computational model comprising a multi - mass vocal fold model and wave - reflection models of the subglottal and supraglottal systems .",
    "a two - mass model of vocal folds , coupled with a variable - length resonator tube , was used in @xcite , and pitch glides were simulated using a four - mass model to analyse the interactions between vocal register transitions and vt resonances in @xcite .",
    "these works reveal a consistent picture of the existence of perturbations caused by resonant loads , and this phenomenon has also been detected experimentally in @xcite using speech recordings and in @xcite using simultaneous recordings of laryngeal endoscopy , acoustics , aerodynamics , electroglottography , and acceleration sensors .",
    "the latter article also contains a review on related voice bifurcations .",
    "although the existence of these perturbations has been well reported , speech modelling studies have given only limited attention to the time - domain dynamics of fundamental frequency glides where such perturbations would be expected to occur .",
    "of the above mentioned studies , upward glides were simulated in @xcite by varying the natural frequency of their physical model over time .",
    "their small amplitude oscillation model exhibited a frequency jump in the vicinity of the resonance of their downstream tube when the load resistance was sufficiently strong .",
    "downward glides were simulated in @xcite followed by upward glides by varying the parameters of a multi - mass vocal fold model .",
    "frequency jumps , subharmonics and amplitude changes were observed in the regions where load reactances were changing rapidly .",
    "changes in the rate of change of the fundamental frequency in these regions can also be seen in their figures 10 - 14 . in @xcite upward",
    "glides were simulated followed by downward glides by adjusting the tension parameter ( i.e. decreasing masses and increasing stiffness parameters by the same factor ) in their four - mass vocal fold model .",
    "they observed frequency jumps associated with register changes , which in turn were shown to occur at different frequencies depending on the vocal tract load .",
    "some of the most popular approaches to modelling phonation are based on the kelly ",
    "lochbaum vocal tract @xcite or various transmission line analogues @xcite .",
    "contrary to these approaches , the proposed model consists of ( ordinary and partial ) differential equations , conservation laws , and coupling equations .",
    "in this modelling paradigm , the temporal and spatial discretisation is conceptually and practically separated from the actual mathematical model of speech .",
    "the computational model is simply a numerical solver for the model equations , written in matlab environment .",
    "the modular design makes it easy to decouple model components for assessing their significance to simulated behaviour .",
    "since the generalised webster s equation for the vt acoustics assumes intersectional area functions as its geometric data , vt configurations from magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) can be used without transcription to non - geometric model parameters .",
    "thus , time - dependent vt geometries are easy to implement . further advantages of speech modelling based on webster s equation have been explained in @xcite where the approach is somewhat similar to one taken here .",
    "the proposed model aims at qualitatively realistic functionality , tunability by a low number of parameters , and tractability of model components , equations , and their relation to biophysics .",
    "similar functionality in higher precision can be obtained using computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) with elastic tissue boundaries . in the cfd approach , the aim is to model the speech apparatus as undivided whole @xcite , but the computational cost is much higher compared to our model or the models proposed in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the numerical efficiency is a key issue because some parameter values or their feasible ranges ( in particular , for hard - to - get physiological parameters ) can only be determined by the trial and error method as discussed in chapter  4 in @xcite , leading to a high number of required simulations .",
    "all voiced speech sounds originate from self - sustained quasi - periodic oscillations of the vocal folds where the closure of the aperture  known as the rima glottidis  between the two string - like vocal folds cuts off the air flow from lungs .",
    "this process is called phonation , and the system comprising the vocal folds and the rima glottidis is known as the glottis .",
    "a single period of the glottal flow produced by phonation is known as a glottal pulse .",

    "in addition , there is the fourth , ring - formed cricoid cartilage whose location is inferior to the thyroid cartilage .",
    "the vocal folds and the associated muscles are supported by these cartilages .",
    "there are two muscles attached between each of the arytenoid cartilages and the cricoid cartilage : the posterior and the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles whose mechanical actions are opposite .",
    "the vocal folds are adducted by the contraction of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles during phonation , and conversely , abducted by the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles during , e.g. , breathing .",
    "this control action is realised by a rotational movement of the arytenoid cartilages in a transversal plane .",
    "in addition , there is a fifth ( unpaired ) muscle  the arytenoid muscle  whose contraction brings the arytenoid cartilages closer to each other , thus reducing the opening of the glottis independently of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles .",
    "these rather complicated control mechanisms regulate the type of phonation in the breathy - pressed scale .    the main mechanism controlling the fundamental frequency @xmath0 of voiced speech sound is actuated by two cricothyroid muscles ( not visible in upper left panel of figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the contraction of these muscles leads to a rotation of the thyroid cartilage with respect to the cricoid cartilage . as a result ,",
    "the thyroid cartilage inclines to the anterior direction , thus stretching the vocal folds .",
    "the elongation of the string - like vocal folds leads to increased stress which raises the fundamental frequency @xmath0 of their longitudinal vibrations .",
    "the vertical movement of larynx also rotates cricoid cartilage impacting @xmath0 .",
    "finally , the phonation and @xmath0 are influenced by subglottal pressure through the control of respiratory muscles .",
    "the anatomic configuration in upper left panel of figure  [ fig : model ] is idealised as a low - order mass - spring system with aerodynamic surfaces as shown in right panel of figure  [ fig : model ] and discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such lumped - element models have been used frequently ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) since the introduction of the classic two - mass model @xcite . for recent reviews of the variety of lumped - element and pde based models and their applications , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the radically simplified glottis model geometry in figure  [ fig : model ] ( right panel ) corresponds to the coronal section through the center of the vocal folds .",
    "both the fundamental frequency @xmath0 as well as the phonation type can be chosen by adjusting parameter values ( see section  4 in @xcite ) . register shifts ( e.g. , from modal register to falsetto ) are not in the scope of this model since it would require either modelling the vocal folds as aerodynamically loaded strings or as a high - order mass - spring system that has a string - like `` elastic '' behaviour .    the vocal fold model in figure  [ fig : model ] ( right panel ) consists of two wedge - shaped moving elements that have two degrees of freedom each : each end of the vocal fold can move in the y - direction .",
    "although this causes some distortion to the shape of the wedges , the displacements are small enough that this effect is negligible .",
    "the distributed mass of these elements is reduced into three mass points which , for the @xmath16 fold , @xmath17 , are located so that @xmath18 is at @xmath19 , @xmath20 at @xmath21 , and @xmath22 at @xmath23 . here",

    "it should be emphasised that the exact numerical correspondence of tissue parameters to lumped model parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 is intractable ( and for most practical purposes even irrelevant ) , and their values in computer simulations must be tuned using measurement data of @xmath0 and the measured form of the glottal pulse @xcite .      during the glottal closed phase ( i.e. , when @xmath49 at the narrow end of the vocal folds ) , there are no proper aerodynamic forces affecting the vocal folds dynamics in equations .",

    "the subglottal resonator equation   is mainly excited by the water hammer .",
    "both of these pulses can be seen in the supra- and subglottal pressure signals @xmath175 and @xmath176 in figure  [ sgt_ia ] .",
    "the water hammer is the most important component of subglottal ringing , accompanied by its first echo that arrives back to vocal folds after approximately @xmath178 delay .",

    "the echoes of the water hammer pulse can be clearly seen in figure  [ sgt_ia ] as well but now the first echo returns after the glottis has opened again due to higher values of @xmath0 and oq in these simulations .",

    "the subglottal effect will get more pronounced when @xmath183 which is the predefined frequency of the first subglottal resonance .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the supraglottal behaviour shown in figure  [ sgt_ia ] since both the vt and the sgt resonators have been realised similarly within the full model .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath0 trajectory in the range @xmath1}$ ] for the subglottal effect depends on the magnitude of the sgt component of the counter pressure , regulated by the parameter @xmath151 in equation  .",
    "considering the model behaviour at supraglottal resonance fractions of @xmath2 [ ] , it is to be expected that the first subglottal resonance fraction @xmath184 should show up similarly .",
    "this , indeed , happens if the coupling constant @xmath151 in equation   is large .",
    "the glottal flow described by equations   contains terms representing the effect of viscosity in the glottis as well as pressure loss and recovery at the entrance and exit of the glottis , respectively .",
    "viscous pressure loss can easily be seen to be significant by considering the glottal dimensions and viscosity of air in the first term of equation  .",
    "it is clear from this equation that the viscous losses dominate at least if the glottal opening is small .",
    "the importance of entrance and exit effects during parts of the glottal open phase can be seen , for example , by comparing simulated volume velocities and glottal opening areas with the experimental curves in figure  3 in @xcite , obtained from a physical model of the glottis . in model simulations , leaving out this transglottal pressure loss term changes the glottal pulse waveform significantly if other model parameters are kept the same , as shown in figure  3.7 in @xcite .",
    "about half of the total pressure loss in simulations is due to entrance and exit effects at the peak of opening of the glottis ; see figure  3.6 in @xcite .",
    "however , the behaviour of the simulated @xmath0 trajectories over @xmath2 [ ] does not change if the transglottal pressure loss term is removed . then , however , the vowel glide must be produced by different model parameter values .",
    "we have reported observations on the locking of simulated @xmath0 glides on a resonance of the vt .",
    "the locking behaviour shows a consistent time - dependent behaviour that is similar for rising and falling glides .",
    "the @xmath0 jump at the beginning of the locking in rising glides and end of the locking in falling glides occurs together with and increased breathiness of phonation as characterised by open quotient @xmath185 and closing quotient @xmath186 . during the locking plateau , these parameters indicated an approximately steady change of phonation type .",
    "the locking takes place only at frequencies determined by sub- or supraglottal resonances .",
    "use of @xmath64 as a secondary control parameter for the glides ensure that the main cause for changes in @xmath185 and @xmath186 is the acoustic loading . by modifying the strength of the acoustic feedback ( i.e. , the parameter @xmath148 in equation  ) and vocal fold tissue losses ( i.e. , the parameter @xmath187 ) , the locking tendency at @xmath2 [ ] may be modulated from non - existent ( where both @xmath148 and @xmath187 have low values ) to extreme locking at @xmath2 [ ] without release ( where @xmath148 and/or @xmath187 have exaggeratedly large values ) ; see figure  [ qual_b_q ] . by decoupling secondary components from the simulation model",
    ", the locking behaviour at @xmath2 [ ] remains the same , even though the model parameter values required for the desired glottal waveform change .",
    "we conclude that the simulation results on vowel glides reported above reflect the model behaviour in a consistent and robust manner .",
    "vowel glides observed in test subjects are another matter .",
    "any model is a simplification of reality , and there is a catch in assessing the role of unmodelled physics : a proper treatment would require the modelling of it .",
    "short of this , we discuss these aspects based on literature , model experiments , and reasoning by analogy .",
    "viscosity of air has not been taken into account in the acoustics model though a measurable effect is likely take place in narrow parts of the vt or sgt .",
    "resulting attenuation can be treated by adding a dissipation term of kelvin  voigt type to equations   and . for a constant diameter waveguide ,",
    "the term is proportional to @xmath188 .",
    "adding viscosity losses will widen and lower the resonance peaks of webster s resonators ( i.e. , lower their q - value ) , with a slight change in the centre frequencies .",
    "an analogous effect can be studied by increasing the tissue dissipation parameter @xmath189 in equation   ( or @xmath190 in equation  ) to a very high value which has been observed not to change the conclusions on vowel glide simulations .",
    "similarly , the overall acoustic resistance of the vt has no qualitative effect which can be seen in @xcite where the modal locking was observed for vowel [ ] at the lowest resonance @xmath191 despite the fact that the anatomic geometry of [ ] has a much wider flow channel than that of [ ]",
    ".    the sgt modelling by the horn is a crude simplification of the fractal - like lower airways and lungs .",
    "the network structure of the subglottal model in @xcite could be replicated by interconnecting a large number of webster s resonators , each modelled by equation  .",
    "the resulting transmission graph is a passive dynamical system by section  5 in @xcite , but it is not clear how to write an efficient fem solver for such configurations .",
    "the model proposed in @xcite as well as the transmission graph approach are likely to produce the correct resonance distribution and frequency - dependent energy dissipation rate at the lung end without tuning .",
    "the horn model does require tuning of the horn opening area and the boundary condition on it in order to get realistic behaviour on the lowest subglottal resonance @xmath192 .",
    "doing so freezes all the higher subglottal resonances at fixed positions , e.g. , @xmath193 .",
    "the branching subglottal models given in figure  8 in @xcite have the second subglottal resonance between @xmath194 and @xmath195 . it was observed in @xcite that the soft tissues introduce an additional resonance to the subglottal system that is lower than the first subglottal formant @xmath196 due to air column dynamics .",
    "the is no obvious way how a horn model could be used to accommodate such a resonance at @xmath197 due to the yielding wall dynamics .",
    "based on the observations on the simulated vowel glides , it seems convincing that the overall subglottal effect on the fundamental frequency @xmath0 is insignificant for vowel glides within @xmath1}$ ] that is over @xmath198 away from @xmath199 .",
    "however , the subglottal effect is certainly discernible in waveforms as in figure  [ sgt_ia ] , but the effect of higher subglottal resonances @xmath200 can not be seen even there . in current simulations of female phonation , the vocal fold mass - spring system has its mechanical resonances at approximately @xmath201 , which acts as a low - pass filter for subglottal excitation in higher frequencies .",
    "the same conclusions are likely to hold when using a more complicated subglottal resonator geometry with one caveat : a graph - like subglottal geometry has lots of cross - mode resonances that affect the subglottal acoustic impedance in other ways than just moving the pole positions .",
    "also the dc - component of the glottal flow loads the acoustic resonators in equations   and .",
    "if we use @xmath202 with @xmath203 instead of @xmath86 as input to the resonator equations , only negligible effects are observed in simulated stable waveforms .",
    "there are more pronounced effects in the beginnings of simulated phonation when a stable waveform has not yet developed .",
    "the idealised vocal folds geometry shown in figure  [ fig : model ] ( right panel ) leads to a particularly simple expression for the aerodynamic force in equation  . replacing the sharp peaks by flat tops in figure  [ fig : model ] ( but keeping the same glottal gap @xmath42 at rest ) results in phonation that has typically lower open quotient ( oq ) whereas the original wedge - like geometry produces more often phonation where the glottis does not close",
    "this change makes it easier to adjust the parametrisation of the model to obtain some phonation targets .",
    "in particular , the glottal loss parameter @xmath84 can be set closer to more commonly used , somewhat larger values since the model geometry becomes more similar to the geometries used in related literature .",
    "another aspect involving the aerodynamic force on vocal fold structures is associated with the hydrostatic pressure reference level in vibrating tissues .",
    "this level is denoted by @xmath204 , and it is expected to satisfy @xmath205 . if the air pressure between the vocal folds were equal to @xmath204 , then the vocal fold wedges would not be accelerated by the pressure difference . in equation",
    ", we use @xmath206 , and we always have @xmath207 . for this reason , the effect of the aerodynamic force is always trying to close the glottis in this case . for small flow velocities @xmath57 , using @xmath208 with @xmath209 in equation   would give the following outcome : the driving pressure @xmath64 would push the vocal folds open more strongly than the aerodynamic force would pull them close .",
    "unfortunately , there is no obvious way to determine the true magnitude of @xmath204 as it is an outcome of dynamic pressure equalisation processes related to @xmath64 and the additional partial pressure due to haemodynamics in tissues .",
    "using a tuned value of @xmath204 instead of @xmath64 in equation   would be desirable , e.g. , in phonation onset simulations ; in particular , if @xmath210 where using @xmath211 would not start a phonation cycle at all .    the glottal flow has been studied extensively since 1950 s . compared to the flow model given above , physiologically more faithful glottal flow solvers have been proposed in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , more sophisticated flow models are challenging to couple to acoustic resonators since the interface between the flow - mechanical ( in particular , the turbulent ) and the acoustic components is no longer clearly defined .",
    "flow separation and coand effect during the diverging phase of the phonatory cycle ( which obviously can not occur in wedge - like geometry of figure  [ fig : model ] ) have been studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite using boundary layer theory and physical model experiments .",
    "the boundary layer leaves the vocal fold surfaces at the time - dependent flow separation point , say @xmath212 , forming a jet which extends downstream into supraglottal space .",
    "thus , the vocal folds `` stall '' at @xmath212 , and the aerodynamic force on them is greatly diminished ; see section  iv in @xcite where the vocal fold model is from @xcite .",
    "similarly , the viscous pressure loss equation  ( a7 ) in @xcite depends only on the upstream part of glottis that ends at @xmath212 .",
    "simplifying assumptions on the vocal fold geometry @xcite",
    "are required for computing @xmath212 , and the result is sensitive to the geometry which makes it challenging to model .",
    "turbulence in supraglottal space is a spatially distributed acoustic source , and it does not provide a scalar flow velocity signal for boundary control as @xmath86 in equation  .",
    "the supraglottal jet may even exert an additional aerodynamic force to vocal folds that would not be part of the acoustic counter pressure @xmath54 from the acoustic resonators .",
    "turbulence in vt constrictions is the primary acoustic source for unvoiced fricatives , and many such sources have been modelled separately in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "much of the turbulence noise energy lies above @xmath213 but webster s model equation   is an accurate description of vt acoustics only below @xmath213 due to the lack of cross - modes @xcite .",
    "this fact speaks against the wisdom of including turbulence noise in the proposed model .",
    "the proposed phonation model treats flow - mechanical and acoustic components using separate equations , and we conclude that this paradigm is not conducive for including the advanced flow - mechanical features discussed above . instead",
    ", phonation models based on navier  stokes equations would be a more appropriate framework .",
    "we have presented a model for vowel production , based on ( partial ) differential equations , that consists of submodels for glottal flow , vocal folds oscillations , and acoustic responses of the vt and subglottal cavities .",
    "the model has been originally designed as a tunable glottal pulse source for a high - resolution vt acoustics simulator that is based on the 3d wave equation and vt geometries obtained by mri as explained in @xcite .",
    "the model has found applications as a controlled source of synthetic vowels that are needed in , e.g. , developing speech processing algorithms such as the inverse filtering @xcite .    in this article , the model was used for simulations of rising and falling vowel glides of [ ] in frequencies that span one octave @xmath1}$ ] .",
    "this interval contains the lowest vt resonance @xmath2 of [ ] but not that of [ ] .",
    "perturbation events in simulated vowel glides were observed at vt acoustic resonances , or at some of their fractions but nowhere else .",
    "the fundamental frequency @xmath0 of the simulated vowel was observed to lock to @xmath2 [ ] but similar locking was not seen at any of the resonance fractions .",
    "the locking events were accompanied by changes in the phonation : increased breathiness below and partially at the locking frequency and steady change in breathiness during most of the lock . such modal locking event takes place only when the acoustic feedback from vt to vocal folds is present , and then it has a characteristic time - dependent behaviour .",
    "a large number of simulation experiments were carried out with different parameter settings of the model to verify the robustness and consistency of all observations .",
    "to what extent do the simulation results validate the proposed model ?",
    "the model produces perturbations of the glottal pulse both at vt resonances and at some of the vt resonance fractions . of the former ,",
    "a wide existing literature was reviewed in introduction .",
    "observations on the subformant perturbations in speech have not been reported , to our knowledge , in experimental literature .",
    "there is a particular temporal pattern of locking in simulated perturbations at @xmath2 [ ] as explained in figure  [ qual_b_q ] ( left panel ) .",
    "although pulse based @xmath0 trajectories are rarely shown in literature , a similar pattern can be seen in the speech spectrograms given in figure  5 in @xcite , and figure  4 in @xcite , as well as in vowel glide samples in the data set of the companion article @xcite .",
    "a similar locking behaviour can also be seen in simulated spectrograms in figure  6 in @xcite and figures  13 and 14 in @xcite , and it can also be interpreted to lie behind the experimental results shown in figures  10b  and  13b of @xcite .",
    "the glottal flow and area simulations in figure  [ sgt_ia ] are remarkably similar with the experimental data presented in figures  4 - 7 in @xcite , the signals produced by different numerical models ( see figures  14a-14c in @xcite , figures  8 and 10 in @xcite , figures  1011 in @xcite , figure  6 in @xcite , figure  5 in @xcite ) , and the glottal pulse waveforms obtained by inverse filtering in , e.g. , figures  1013 in @xcite , figures  5.3 , 5.4 , and 5.17 in @xcite , @xcite , and figures  3 and 6 in @xcite .    the simulation model does not include the neural control actions on the vocal fold structures or dynamic modifications of the vt geometry .",
    "there is also a significant control action affecting the subglottal pressure and it has been used as a control variable in equations   for glide productions . in humans ,",
    "neural control actions are part of feedback loops , of which some are auditive , and some others operate directly through tissue innervation and the central nervous system .",
    "so little is known about these feedback mechanisms that their explicit mathematical modelling seems infeasible . instead",
