    "the evolving field of spin - electronics has triggered an increasing interest in materials with full spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "many of these systems have been predicted by means of electronic band - structure calculations @xcite , and some of them are in use already as elements in multi - layered magneto - electronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite and also as giant magneto - resistance spin valves @xcite .",
    "promising device candidates are characterized by a strong spin polarization , by high curie temperatures and by a large band gap , too . among the most popular groups of materials",

    "this implies that their exchange couplings can be described by a heisenberg hamiltonian which allows the investigation of the temperature properties of the magnetic systems within a very simple concept .",
    "it therefore seems that the problem of calculating the exchange interaction parameters with the help of reliable electronic structure methods must have a very high priority in this field .    nonetheless , despite a thorough theoretical understanding of the electronic structures of many full heusler alloys ( see , for example , refs .",
    "kuebler83,dederichs , freeman , nieminen , ishida95_1 , ishida95_2,ishida90 ) , only very few publications are dedicated to the discussions of magnetic exchange interactions in these systems .",
    "noda and ishikawa @xcite have extracted the exchange parameters from the spin - wave spectrum using a model - like heisenberg fit . on the theoretical side , kbler , williams and sommers focused on the calculated total - energy differences between the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and different antiferromagnetic ( afm ) states kuebler83 .",
    "the parameters of the heisenberg hamiltonian were then fitted to reproduce the course of the calculated energies but such technique usually allows to extract only the parameters of the first and second neighbors , and the interactions between mn and all other atoms are neglected for reasons of simplicity .    in this contribution , we derive the magnetic exchange parameters of a number of heusler alloys from first principles and then analyze the magnetic coupling dependence on electronic structure variations induced by atomic substitutions or volume variations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section [ sec : struc ] we describe the crystal structure under investigation and the computational method chosen .",
    "section sec : grand - theory is devoted to the parameter - free derivation of exchange parameters by theoretical approaches within density - functional theory . section [ sec : results ] contains our results for the electronic structures and the magnetic interaction parameters of the co@xmath1mnz , rh@xmath1mnz and x@xmath1mnsn families of alloys . finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "the uniqueness of the heusler alloys is due to the fact that they exhibit cooperative magnetic phenomena  especially ferromagnetism  in the desired temperature range although no constituent of their archetype , cu@xmath0mnal , exhibits such properties in the elemental state .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it is justified to take the minority - spin orbitals because , due to the exchange hole , these lie higher in energy and are relatively diffuse such that they are much more involved in the chemical bonding @xcite .",
    "their larger diffuseness also leads to the finding that spin - polarized ground states show larger interatomic distances despite of having a lower total energy @xcite .",

    "fig : fig2 ] ) is placed below the co ",
    "co @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbitals . for co@xmath1mnge , the @xmath51 orbital",
    "is filled with one extra electron .",

    "dederichs ) . note that this is an over - simplification because the symmetry labels are not strictly valid over the entire reciprocal space .",
    "as expected , the dos around the fermi level is heavily dominated by the @xmath54 states of the mn and co atoms , and the majority spin states are nearly fully occupied .",
    "the dos curves for the minority spins exhibit two peaks above the fermi level which are due to both mn and co @xmath54 contributions .",
    "the difference in the positions of these two peaks is directly determined by the difference in intra - atomic exchange splitting between mn and co. the broad structure in the lowest energy region between @xmath550.8 and @xmath550.55 ry goes back to ( magnetically inactive ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 states of ga , and they are well separated from the @xmath54 states positioned in an energy region between @xmath550.45 and 0.3 ry .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fermi level of co@xmath0mnga is found at the dos minimum of the minority states , but for z = si and ge it is positioned exactly in a gap , that is , these two latter compounds exhibit 100% spin polarization .",
    "this gap has previously been reported by other authors and is formed due to the strong @xmath54@xmath54 hybridization ( orbital mixing ) between the co and mn atoms @xcite .    in such half - metallic compounds",
    "the total spin moment should ideally be an integer number ( see discussion in ref .",
    "our results for the co@xmath1mnz group , presented in tab .  [ tab : tab_heusler ] , are very close to that , and there is only a slight deviation from integer numbers reproducing so - called slater ",
    "pauling behavior : here , the total moment equals @xmath58 where @xmath42 is the total number of valence electrons in the unit cell . in accord with the dos observation in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] , the z ( @xmath59-type ) atoms in co@xmath0mnz have negligible moments .",
    "the minority - spin states of the mn atoms are nearly empty ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , and the values of the local mn spin moments arrive at ca .  3 @xmath60 .",
    "the co atoms do have significant spin moments , about 0.7 @xmath61 in co@xmath0mnga and about 1.0 @xmath60 in the remaining compounds of this family .",
    "clearly , and also most importantly , the exchange interactions between the co and mn atoms can not be neglected _ a priori_.    accordingly , the calculated values of the partial contributions @xmath47 to the effective exchange parameter @xmath62 are presented in tab .",
    "as has been alluded to already , the interaction between mn and co atoms gives a _ leading _ contribution to the total effective coupling , thereby questioning the assumption used in earlier work @xcite in that only mn  mn interactions were taken into consideration ; in terms of @xmath54@xmath54 orbital overlap , this leading contribution is not at all surprising .",
    "on the other side , the co  co interaction is negative ( @xmath63 mry ) in co@xmath64mnga and thereby demonstrates the tendency for afm ordering in the co sublattice .",
    "this negative value , however , is compensated by the larger _ positive _ interaction between co and mn ( @xmath65 mry ) such that the _ effective _ @xmath66 of co remains large and positive .",
    "mn contribution to @xmath67 is on the order of only 1 mry , this is nearly five times smaller than the co  mn interaction .    for completeness , we mention that pure @xmath68-mn exhibits an afm ordering at low temperature ( @xmath69 ) , and the small positive exchange parameters by the nearest - neighbor mn  mn pairs in mn - based heusler compounds correspond to likewise positive and small second - neighbor pairs exchange parameters in pure @xmath68-mn",
    ". the theoretical values for the curie temperatures @xmath48 obtained by the mfa are also included in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab_heusler ] . for co@xmath1mnga",
    ", @xmath48 arrives at 635 k and underestimates the experimental value ( 694 k ) by about 10% .",
    "taking into account the fact that the mfa usually _ overestimates _ curie temperatures , this must be considered an even larger disagreement with experiment .",
    "to check the nature of this disagreement , we performed a calculation of @xmath70beyond the lwa using eq .",
    "[ e7 ] . in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab_heusler ] we also show the corresponding results obtained using this approach .",
    "our calculations reveal that the effective coupling between the mn atoms is practically unchanged so that the lwa is perfectly suitable for the descripton of this coupling .",
    "however , all other couplings are affected much more strongly by this approximation . for instance , the co  co interactions are modified nearly by a factor of two while co  mn interactions are increased by 2535% overall .",
    "correspondingly , the estimated critical temperatures of magnetic phase transition for this group of alloys are increased by 1020 % , and they are larger than the experimentally observed quantities .",
    "it follows from the results presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : j0 ] that the substitution of the main - group iii element ga by a main - group iv element such as si , ge or sn leads to a significant increase of both @xmath71 and @xmath72 values .",
    "fortunately , the implications for the varying electronic structure introduced by such a substitution can be well described within the rigid - band approximation ( rba ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for illustration ,",
    "fig : fig4 shows a comparison between the electronic structures of co@xmath0mnga and co@xmath0mnge in the energy region @xmath73 ry around the fermi level .",
    "the zero energy in the lower dos curve corresponds to the fermi level of co@xmath0mnge with 29 valence electrons ; for co@xmath0mnga with 28 valence electrons , the fermi level is given by the solid vertical line in the upper dos . obviously , the dos shapes for these two compounds are very similar to each other , a nice support for the reliability of the rba .",
    "thus , by simply changing the total number of valence electrons one may reproduce the substitution of ga by ge fairly well , qualitatively .",
    "nonetheless , the total moment calculated from the electronic structure of co@xmath64mnga only by extending the dos to 29 valence electrons is just 4.6 @xmath74 , that is , 8% smaller than the numerical result ( 5 @xmath75 ) for co@xmath1mnge , and we will soon focus on this ( small ) discrepancy originating from differing interatomic distances . in the frame of the rba , the significant increase in the exchange parameters ( tab .  tab : j0 ) in going from co@xmath1mnga to co@xmath1mnge goes back to the shift of the fermi energy ( band filling in ref .",
    "@xcite ) which corresponds to the one extra electron .",
    "this evolution of the effective parameters @xmath76 and also @xmath77 as a function of the fermi level is also included in fig .",
    "fig : fig4 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath66 values of co@xmath1mnga at the fermi level of co@xmath1mnge equal those of the real co@xmath1mnge phase .",
    "taking into consideration the usual mfa overestimation of the curie temperatures , our calculation for co@xmath1mnge gives an acceptable agreement ( 1115 k ) with the experimental value of 905 k.    the dependence of the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the co@xmath1mnz alloys on the chemical nature of the isoelectronic z atom has already been discussed in refs .",
    "we will focus on the density of states ( dos ) ( see fig .",
    "[ dos_co2mnz ] ) of co@xmath1mnz ( z = si , ge and sn ) which all display the same valence electron concentration . not too surprisingly , the doss are similar to the preceding one of co@xmath1mnga . however , all peaks below the fermi level move to higher energies with increasing lattice parameters because of enlarging atomic radii . the latter results in a smaller overlap between the mn @xmath54 and co @xmath54 orbitals which , in turn , leads to a smaller dispersion of these bands @xcite , becoming more atomic - like . as a consequence ,",
    "the dos peaks come closer to each other and their amplitudes grow ( fig .",
    "dos_co2mnz ) .    because the changes in peak positions with changing z element is proportional to the change in the lattice parameter , the replacement of si by ge has smaller consequences than the replacement of ge by sn ; in terms of radii ( and chemical behavior ) , si and ge are more similar to each other .",
    "thus , the movement in the dos peaks is more distinct for co@xmath0mnsn . in agreement with the results of full - potential calculations @xcite , the mn magnetic moment obtained in our tb - lmto - asa calculation slightly _ increases _ in the si @xmath78 ge @xmath79 sn series . on the other hand ,",
    "the co magnetic moment is _ lowered _ so that the total magnetic moment is close to 5 @xmath61 in all three cases ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : tab_heusler ] ) .",
    "the increase of the mn magnetic moment is consistent with the increase of the mn ",
    "mn contribution to the effective @xmath80 ( third column in tab .",
    "[ tab : j0 ] ) in this series of compounds .",
    "the increase , however , is compensated by lower values for the co  co and also co  mn interactions .",
    "thus , the calculated @xmath48 s decrease along the line si @xmath78 ge @xmath78 sn ( see tab .  tab : tab_heusler ) , and this qualitative trend agrees with the tendency observed experimentally .    to fully demonstrate the volume dependence of the exchange interactions ( and curie temperatures , too ) , we also calculated the course of @xmath66 in co@xmath0mnsi solely as a function of its volume .",
    "that is to say , the structure of co@xmath8mnsi was artificially expanded to lattice parameters that would better fit the compounds adopted by its higher homologues ge and sn ; unfortunately , this is impossible to realize experimentally .",
    "[ j0_vol ] displays the values of the @xmath66 parameters obtained from these calculations , and the purely volume - derived exchange parameters are in semi - quantitative agreement with those that go back to proper calculations of @xmath66 for the real co@xmath1mnge and co@xmath1mnsn systems with their correct lattice parameters .",
    "it is just too obvious that the behavior of the curie temperature can therefore be explained by a simple volume effect when the si atom is substituted by ge or sn .    a detailed comparison of tabs .",
    "[ tab : tab_j_ij_co2mnz ] and [ tab : vec ] in terms of @xmath10 makes it clear that the interactions are relatively short ranged and do not exceed the , say , first four neighbors in each sublattice . the main exchange parameter , @xmath81 of co@xmath82mn in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab_j_ij_co2mnz ] , corresponds to the nearest - neighbor co ",
    "mn interaction .",
    "this particular entry of the table alone already gives about 70% of the total contribution to @xmath66 between co and mn atoms and is about ten times larger than the corresponding co  co and mn  mn interactions ; a remarkable result but , as has been said before , not too surprising when considering the interatomic overlap .",
    "for comparison , tab .",
    "[ tab : tab_j_ij_co2mnz ] also contains the exchange parameters obtained in earlier work @xcite where the authors calculated mn  mn exchange parameters from the total energy differences of the fm and afm structures but by ignoring the co  mn interactions .",
    "naturally , their approach had to result in significantly larger mn  mn interactions in order to reproduce the fm / afm energy differences because in such an approximation all interactions ( mn  mn and mn  co ) are effectively _ mapped _ into the mn  mn - type @xmath10 .",
    "thus , one needs to compare an effective parameter for the mn atom , namely @xmath83 from tab .",
    "[ tab : j0 ] with @xmath84 from ref .",
    "the obtained values are 10.9 mry and 8.4 mry correspondingly .",
    "this similarity between the results of the very different models suggests relatively localized magnetic character in this system .",
    "independent full - potential calculations of the electronic structure of this group have been published recently @xcite and our results are in agreement with them . to ease the understanding of the new chemical system",
    ", we compare the densities - of - states of rh@xmath0mnsn with the preceding one of co@xmath0mnsn , and both are included in fig .",
    "generally , the gap in the minority - spin states of the co@xmath0mnz phases can also be observed for the rh@xmath1mnz phases but this gap apparently becomes broader and the fermi level is no longer found in the gap .",
    "consequently , the total magnetic moment can no longer be an integer number for this group of intermetallic compounds , and the entries of tab .",
    "[ tab : tab_heusler ] impressively support this statement .",
    "another important difference is given by the smaller width and also polarization of the rhodium @xmath54 states relative to those of cobalt .",
    "in chemical terms , this notable difference between the @xmath54 and @xmath85 ( and also @xmath86 ) elements is easily explained by differences in spatial shielding , with interesting similarities to main - group chemistry @xcite . in any case , the magnetic moment of the rh atoms is only about half the size of those of the co atoms , namely ca .",

    "in contrast to the co - based system , the mn moments in this group are larger by about 0.6 @xmath61 . such a change has been explained dederichs by a smaller hybridization between the rh and mn atoms than between the co and mn atoms .",
    "alternatively , a chemical interpretation would focus on an effectively over - sized mn atom because of the strongly widened lattice due to the large rh atoms .",
    "thus , the majority / minority spin splitting for mn is strongly favored , and the intra - atomic exchange splitting will be mirrored by extraordinarily diffuse minority - spin orbitals for mn .",
    "the same effect takes place in fepd@xmath87 where fe acquires a very large moment because of being too spacious @xcite . unlike the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the total magnetic moments of our calculations do not monotonically increase in the row ge @xmath78 sn @xmath78 pb , but this effect is probably related to the atomic spheres approximation used by us .    we will now analyze the results for the exchange coupling using eq .
