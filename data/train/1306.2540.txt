    "<S> orbani , pellicer and weiss studied the truncation of @xmath2-orbit maps for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> they introduced the notion of @xmath4-compatible maps in order to give a necessary condition for a truncation of a @xmath2-orbit map to be either @xmath2- , @xmath5- or @xmath6-orbit map . using a similar notion , by introducing an appropriate partition on the set of flags of the maps , we extend the results on truncation of @xmath2-orbit maps for @xmath7 and @xmath8 . + </S>"
