    "we make use of fiducial l@xmath2 simulated disk galaxy ( g15784 ) from the mcmaster unbiased galaxy survey ( mugs ) ( stinson et  al . 2010 ) . our earlier work with this simulation has focused on the temporal evolution of its metallicity gradient ( pilkington et  al .",
    "2012a ) and metallicity distribution function ( calura et  al .",
    "2012 ) . here",
    ", we examine briefly the distribution of recent star formation within the simulation , with an emphasis on the location of the young stars with respect to the simulation s most prominent spiral arm .    a detailed description of the g15784 can be found in stinson et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and pilkington et  al .",
    "( 2012a ) ; here , we simply provide a brief overview of the star formation prescription .",
    "the mugs simulations were run with the gravitational n - body @xmath3 sph code gasoline ( wadsley et  al .",
    "stars particles are formed with a user - specificed efficiency from gas particles when the latter are sufficiently cool ( @xmath415000  k ) , dense ( @xmath51  @xmath6 ) , and taking part in a convergent flow ( @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9@xmath40 ) .",
    "energy feedback from supernovae adheres to the stinson et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) blastwave formalism .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) shows the young stellar population ( in this case , stars born in the last 300  myr , at redshift @xmath10=0 ) of the g15784 simulation .",
    "the prominence of the centrally - concentrated star formation has been commented upon already by stinson et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , pilkington et  al .",
    "( 2012a ) , and calura et  al .",
    "three 100  myr age bins are denoted , with the youngest in blue , the intermediate in green , and the oldest in red .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] isolates the most prominent spiral feature within the simulation ( noted by the box inset to the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "_ we find that the younger ( older ) stars tend to lie on the inside / trailing ( outside / leading ) parts of the arm .",
    "this age ` gradient ' in the young stellar populations orthogonal to the arm is consistent with the basic predictions of classical density wave theory , where star formation has been triggered by gas shocked by the passage of a spiral density wave , see dobbs & pringle ( 2010).a more thorough examination of the issues pertaining to spiral arm age gradient / offsets can be found in grand et  al .",
    "_    the offsets we see in the stellar populations associated with the spiral arm are most prominent in the ` upper ' part of the figure , before the arm opens up to its full extent . to achieve a fairer comparison with both the high - resolution models of dobbs & pringle ( 2010 ) and the observations which show very similar trends ( e.g. for m51 , as in snchez - gil et  al .",
    "2011 ) , we would need much finer temporal resolution ( where the age ranges probed are 0@xmath1110  myrs , rather than 0@xmath11300  myrs ) ; having said that , the gross trends in orthogonal age gradients / offets do appear to extend to @xmath1100  myr old stellar populations ( e.g. calzetti et  al . 2005 ) and so perhaps the result highlight here is not obviated by the larger age bins .",
    "finally , we wish to show our most recent work on the distribution of metals in a suite of @xmath10.1  l@xmath0 disk simulations undertaken with a wide range of feedback prescriptions ( including supernovae and thermal energy from ob - stars during their pre - supernovae phase ) , initial mass functions , and metal diffusion efficiencies .",
    "we focus here on our fiducial simulation , 11mkroupa , which was first introduced in a different context by brook et  al .",
    "this simulation , like g15784 , was realized with the gasoline code , but with an upgraded version to take into account the chemical enrichment histories of broader spectrum of elements beyond just oxygen and iron .",
    "the left - most panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows the age - metallicity relation of the ` solar neighborhood ' ( an annulus @xmath13 disk scalelengths from the center , lying within a kpc of the mid - plane ) associated with 11mkroupa .",
    "the middle panel shows the the corresponding relationship in the solar neighborhood of the milky way , as derived from the geneva - copenhagne survey ( gcs ) by holmberg et  al .",
    "the right - most panel shows the associated metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) for these respective ` solar neighborhoods ' ; the ( indistiguishable ) overlaid curves on the right - most mdf within the panel correspond to two cuts of the gcs ( effectively , ` volume - limited ' and ` open ' , in some sense - details provided in pilkington et  al .",
    "2012b ) , while the left - most mdf is that constructed from 11mkroupa .",
    "what should be readily apparent from figure  [ fig2 ] is that the age - metallicity relation for the solar neighborhood of 11mkroupais significantly more correlated than that of the milky way s solar neighborhood and that it is very tight at a given age .",
    "the former should not be surprising , in that the star formation and infall histories of the two are not the same .",
    "regardless , this tight correlation has an inexorable effect on the resulting mdf , in the sense that it is more negatively skewed , possesses greater kurtosis , while the mdf s ` peak ' component is quite narrow ( due to the minimal dispersion in [ fe / h ] at a given age convolved with the simulation s star formation history ) .",
    "a deeper analysis is provided by pilkington et  al .",
    "( 2012b ) .    without the help of our collaborators ,",
    "this work would not have been possible ; we thank them for their ongoing advice and guidance .",
