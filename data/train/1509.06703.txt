    "it is a surprising fact , known for almost a century @xcite that the equilibrium position of the particle becomes stable if the surface rotates around the vertical axis sufficiently fast ( a heuristic explanation of this effect can be found in @xcite , and is also given below ) .",
    "numerical experiments show another puzzling effect : the foucault  like prograde precession happening in the inertial frame @xcite , figure  [ fig : illustration1 ] .",
    "0.1 in a similarly surprising phenomenon is the stabilization of a ball rolling without slipping on a rotating saddle surface ( several demonstrations can be found on youtube ) @xcite .",
    "superficially , the two effects appear to be the same ; however , the reasons for stability are entirely different . for the rolling ball , the gyroscopic effect , which has no counterpart for a point mass in our case , plays the key role .",
    "in fact , the rolling ball is stable even if the surface is horizontal and flat , @xcite .",
    "the rolling ball is an entirely different system : first , it is a nonholonomic system ( see @xcite for more details ) , unlike the one considered here , and second , it has more degrees of freedom . 0.1 in returning to the particle in the rotating saddle potential , the force field @xmath9 in ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) admits the following nice interpretation . consider the saddle force field @xmath10 , and make it time  dependent by rotating each vector counterclockwise with angular velocity @xmath11 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) describes the motion of the unit point mass in this force field .",
    "we note that @xmath12 is the reflection in the @xmath13axis followed by a rotation by @xmath14 counterclockwise .",
    "equivalently , @xmath15 is the reflection with respect to the line which forms the angle @xmath16 with respect to the @xmath13axis .",
    "thus @xmath15 is an anti  orthogonal matrix , with eigenvalues @xmath17 , and satisfying @xmath18 the identity matrix .",
    "the following result was stated in @xcite , but without the derivation .",
    "[ mainthm ] given a vector function @xmath19 , consider its  guiding center \" , or the  hodograph \" image @xmath20    if @xmath21 is a solution of ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) , then @xmath22 satisfies @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a function linear in @xmath25 , @xmath26 and analytic in @xmath27 , in a fixed neighborhood of @xmath28 .",
    "the guiding center therefore behaves , ( ignoring the @xmath29terms ) as a point charge of unit mass in the potential @xmath30 in the magnetic field of constant magnitude @xmath31 perpendicular to the @xmath32plane .",
    "the hodograph transformation ( [ eq : guidingcenter ] ) uncovers , in particular , a hidden coriolis  like force @xmath33 ; this seems to be the first example when such a force arises in an _ inertial _ reference frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : illustration1](c ) shows some trajectories of ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) with the motion of the guiding center superimposed on them",
    ". some motions of the guiding center itself are illustrated in figure  [ fig : illustration1](b ) .",
    "it should be noted that the  magnetic \" effect @xmath34 is of higher order than the quadratic restoring force @xmath35 ; this explains why for @xmath27 small the  petals \" become more closely spaced , figure  [ fig : illustration1 ] .",
    "0.1 in before proceeding with proof , we make a few observations that become clear in the course of the proof .",
    "0.1 in    contrary to what one might expect , any averaging transformation _ must _ involve @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , transforming just the configuration @xmath37 alone can not get rid of the time  dependence in the original equation _ in principle_. put differently , _ the class of contact transformations is insufficiently wide to carry out the averaging of our system ( [ eq : linear.trap])_. this is explained in the section [ impossibility ] .    the formal averaging procedure due to kapitsa @xcite described in landau ",
    "lifshitz @xcite is incomplete and may give an incorrect result if one is not cautious or not lucky , as pointed out in section [ impossibility ] .",
    "it is tempting to study the system in the rotating frame ( as had been done , @xcite ) , since in such a frame the equations become autonomous , exchanging the time dependence for the two inertial forces : the coriolis force and the centrifugal force ( in fact , the system in such coordinates is linear and thus admits explicit solutions , @xcite ) .",
    "the motions we are studying here correspond to a fixed region of @xmath38 ; in the rotating reference system this region is not fixed as @xmath39 becomes large , which makes this frame poorly suited for using normal form . as a side remark , a physical manifestation of the dependence of the neighborhood on @xmath1 is the fact that solutions such as ones in figure  [ fig : illustration1 ] undergo rapid rotations around the origin when viewed in a rotating frame .",
    "before giving a proof of our statement , we mention that time - periodic non - autonomous equations ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) , as well as their autonomous version in the rotating frame , arise in numerous applications across many seemingly unrelated branches of classical and modern physics @xcite . in celestial mechanics",
    "the rotating saddle equations describe linear stability of the triangular lagrange libration points @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the restricted circular three - body problem @xcite . by this reason ,",
    "the classical work by gascheau of 1843 may be considered as the first one that established stability conditions for a particle on a rotating saddle @xcite .",
    "however , it was not until brouwer , one of the authors of the fixed point theorem in topology , considered in 1918 stability of a heavy particle on a rotating slippery surface @xcite that the rotating saddle trap per se became an object for investigation .    indeed , according to earnshaw s theorem",
    "an electrostatic potential can not have stable equilibria , i.e. minima , since such potentials are harmonic functions .",
    "the theorem does not apply , however , if the potential depends on time ; in fact , the 1989 nobel prize in physics was awarded to w. paul @xcite for his invention of the trap for suspending charged particles in an oscillating electric field .",
    "paul s idea was to stabilize the saddle by `` vibrating '' the electrostatic field , by analogy with the so  called stephenson - kapitsa pendulum @xcite in which the upside  down equilibrium is stabilized by vibration of the pivot .",
    "brouwer @xcite explicitly demonstrated that , instead of vibration , the saddle can also be stabilized by rotation of the potential ( in two dimensions ) .",
    "this effect is used , e.g. , in quantum optics , in the theory of rotating radio - frequency ion traps @xcite .    in plasma physics equations ( [ eq : linear.trap ] )",
    "appear in the modeling of a stellatron  a high - current betatron with stellarator fields used for accelerating electron beams in helical quadrupole magnetic fields @xcite . in atomic physics",
    "the stable triangular lagrange points were produced in the schrdinger - lorentz atomic electron problem by applying a circularly polarized microwave field rotating in synchrony with an electron wave packet in a rydberg atom @xcite . this has led to a first observation of a non  dispersing bohr wave packet localized near the lagrange point while circling the atomic nucleus indefinitely @xcite .",
    "recently , the rotating saddle equations ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) reappeared in the study of confinement of massless dirac particles , e.g. electrons in graphene @xcite .",
    "even stability of a rotating flow of a perfectly conducting ideal fluid in an azimuthal magnetic field possesses a mechanical analogy with the stability of lagrange triangular equilibria and , consequently , with the gyroscopic stabilization on a rotating saddle @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that in mechanical engineering equations ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) describe stability of a mass mounted on a non - circular weightless rotating shaft subject to a constant axial compression force @xcite .",
    "in an attempt to bring ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) to a normal form , let us choose a new variable @xmath42 via @xmath43    [ rem : motivation]*heuristically , * this transformation is suggested by the following reasoning : at a fixed position @xmath44 , the force @xmath45 rotates in a circle with angular velocity @xmath46 . if an otherwise free particle were subject to such a force , it would move in a circle if we subtract the drift , with @xmath47 being the centripetal force , and thus given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the radius of the circle . with @xmath50",
    "this gives @xmath51 , explaining the choice ( [ eq : cv1 ] ) .",

    "this shows that such formal averaging of the coefficients is illegal .",

    "@xmath69 0.1 in    before proceeding with the rest of the normal form reduction ( section [ higher order reduction ] ) , we pause to make a few heuristic remarks in the next two sections .",
    "it is now tempting to make further change of variables of the form @xmath70 to eliminate the @xmath71terms in ( [ eq : first.normal.form ] ) . perhaps surprisingly , no such transformation will work , as can be checked by explicit substitution .",
    "this leads to a somewhat unfortunate but unavoidable conclusion :    no transformation of the form ( [ eq : configspacetransforms ] ) can eliminate @xmath71terms in ( [ eq : first.normal.form ] ) .",
    "in other words , the class of contact transformations is not rich enough to do the averaging in our system .",
    "we conclude :    _ in order to average out the time ",
    "dependent terms in the rotating saddle trap equation , it is necessary to widen the class of transformations ( [ eq : configspacetransforms ] ) to include non  contact ones .",
    "_ 0.1 in    kapitsa @xcite described formal averaging of the scalar equation @xmath72 see also @xcite .",
    "this heuristic procedure applies to ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) as well , although our equation ( [ eq : linear.trap ] ) has a matrix instead of the scalar coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "it must be pointed out that kapitsas heuristic procedure gives only @xmath74terms , but not the cubic ones ; and it is these terms that are responsible for the  precession \" in figure  [ fig : illustration1 ] .",
    "for a fixed location @xmath75 , the force vector @xmath76 rotates counterclockwise . _ if the force were independent of @xmath77 near @xmath78 , _ then a non  drifting particle would move in a circle , with @xmath79 , the centripetal force , related to the radius vector @xmath80 via @xmath81 , so that @xmath82 now so far we pretended that @xmath83 given by ( [ eq : forcecircle ] ) does not depend on @xmath13 . but",

    "we have @xmath92 the key point is that the last term is constant : @xmath93 thus providing the bias mentioned earlier .",
    "this constancy is due to the fact that the @xmath89dependence in @xmath94 enters in both @xmath15 and @xmath95 and the two dependencies happen to cancel .",
    "indeed , let us temporarily fix @xmath96 , while allowing @xmath97 to change ; then @xmath98 travels _ clockwise _ since @xmath15 is orientation  reversing .",
    "but if we fix @xmath97 instead and let @xmath15 depend on @xmath89 , then @xmath99 would rotate _ counterclockwise _ with the same angular velocity .",
    "the two rotations thus cancel , explaining the constancy of @xmath99 .",
