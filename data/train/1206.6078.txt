    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that von zeipel s theorem @xcite has a significant effect on the geometry of the wind .",
    "in particular , mass loss from a fast rotator is expected to be predominantly concentrated towards the poles , where the effective gravity and radiative field are large .",
    "this naturally explains the bipolar structure without requiring a two winds interaction , as previously suggested .",
    "@xcite applied the standard line driven winds model @xcite to explain the form of the nebula .",
    "they have shown that if the polar temperature is @xmath1k , the line driving bi - stability jump would give rise to a large increase in the equatorial mass loss , thus offering an explanation to the origin of the  skirt \" .",
    "an alternative model for the overall structure of the homunculus was developed by @xcite .",
    "the nebula is described as explosively ejected material from a critically rotating surface .",
    "an assumption that the initial velocity is proportional to the effective gravity gives the bipolar structure .",
    "the skirt is obtained within some range of parameters , for which the orbits of matter originating at opposite low latitudes pass through the equatorial plane and collide .",
    "recently , @xcite advocated the idea that the twin lobe structure is due to an interaction with the companion star .",
    "in particular , soker argued that it is hard to reconcile the large bipolar mass loss of the great eruption with _ standard _ models of stellar winds , for two reasons .",
    "first , one can not obtain a high ratio between the wind momentum ( @xmath2 ) and the photon momentum ( @xmath3 ) , as observed .",
    "second , in order to explain the bipolar structure , the envelope is assumed to be near critical rotation .",

    ", it was shown that such atmospheres give rise to optically thick winds with a relatively simple mass - loss luminosity relation , which also explains the behavior of classical novae @xcite .",
    "the bipolar structure of the homunculus is a clear incentive to consider that its origin is a sed continuum driven wind from a rotating star .",

    ", we develop the theory behind continuum driven winds from rotating stars and the associated evolution of angular momentum . in ",
    "[ part2 ] , this theory is then applied to the case of , explaining its high spin , and the formation of the homunculus nebula and equatorial skirt .    as a side note",
    ", we study in  [ sec : spin ] generic interactions between the binary components , and show that spin - orbit coupling could not have been responsible for the high spin . in  [ sec : angmomdif ] , we show that during the first few years of the great eruption ,  could not have been rigidly rotating .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : windstheory ] by developing an approximate analytical model of continuum driven winds from rotating stars . in  [ sec : spinup ] , we show that at low mass loss rates , such winds are capable of spinning up the star , even though angular momentum is lost to the wind . in  [ sec : skirttheory ] , we study the consequences of eruptions to  the  evolution  of  the  stellar angular momentum .      a complete analysis of the dynamics of lbv eruptions is quite complicated . in general , one should solve the navier - stokes equations for the wind , coupled to the radiative transfer .",
    "furthermore , as we argue that the star is rotating near breakup , its oblique shape must be taken into account .",
    "such an analysis is amenable only by a numerical treatment .",
    "since we wish to understand the underlying physics , this path will not be taken here .    in order to encapsulate the relevant phenomena within a simple analytical model",
    ", we make the following simplifying assumptions .    a.   the star is spherical .",
    "b.   there is no latitudinal motion ( @xmath4 .    under these approximations ,",
    "the model is integrable .",
    "we first note that the typical wind velocity is of the order of magnitude of the escape velocity , which is much larger than the speed of sound .",
    "this implies that the kinetic energy density is significantly higher than the internal energy of the gas ; mechanical pressure and viscosity will therefore be neglected .",
    "we focus on two fields : the velocity of the wind @xmath5 and the radiative flux @xmath6 , and begin with conservation of momentum : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the sum of the different forces per unit mass , with @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the opacity . at a steady state ,",

    ", we can determine the radiative and mass fluxes at the base of the wind : @xmath27 the requirement @xmath28 gives @xmath29    unlike line driven winds , the mass flux expected in a sed continuum driven wind is inherently local .",
    "this is because the critical surface of the wind , where the gravitational and radiative forces balance , depends only on the size of the inhomogeneous structure formed by radiative hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "since the hydrostatic scale height , over which these instabilities operate , is much smaller than the stellar radius , mass loss is determined by local conditions . as the local atmospheric structure can not distinguish between gravity and the centrifugal force",
    ", the mass loss will depend on the local _ effective _ gravity .",
    "generalizing the local mass flux derived by @xcite , we have @xmath30 where @xmath31    this is analogous to the local wind flux in sed accretion disks @xcite . here",

    "last , @xmath34 is the wind constant , which encapsulates mostly geometrical features described by @xcite , but may have a weak dependence on @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite have shown that this dependence is stronger if the inhomogeneous structure comprising the unstable atmosphere is power law dominated by smaller scales . however , as we shall see below , this merely scales the mass loss by a constant factor since @xmath36 is latitudinally independent .",
    "note that a weak latitudinal dependence of the mass loss should arise from the latitudinal dependence of @xmath37 at the base of the wind .",
    "however , @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath38 which itself is a very weak function of the optical depth .    neglecting the aforementioned weak dependences , the flux depends on @xmath36 as @xmath39 under the above approximations , a comparison with eq .",

    ", one could argue that even if the star were spherical , radiative diffusion would have given rise to latitudinal radiation and velocity components .",
    "however , since most of the acceleration takes place close to the surface , these components are bound to be small .",
    "as the star blows wind , it loses angular momentum .",
    "however , specific angular momentum and thus the dimensionless spin @xmath53 may increase , as we now show .",
    "we start with conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the angular momentum reduction of the star is the angular momentum taken by the wind : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the stellar radius of gyration .",

    "the condition for self spin - up is therefore @xmath64    for a high load wind @xmath65 , and the star spins down . @xcite .",
    "] however , at low mass loss rates , corresponding to @xmath66 , the flux is insufficient to push the wind over the effective potential at equatorial latitudes .",
    "the wind reaches infinity only for angles between the pole and @xmath67 we expect the rest of the wind to stagnate and fall back , thus taking no net angular momentum . therefore , @xmath68 one should note that the photon tiring number should be computed using the mass loss at the surface of the star , not at infinity .",
    "this quantity relates to the observed ejecta by truncating the surface integration of @xmath69 ( eq . [ eq : mdotphi ] ) at @xmath70 : @xmath71    using equations ( [ eq : thetamax ] ) - ( [ eq : minfty ] ) one finds @xmath72      in the previous section , we studied the effects of continuum driven winds on the evolution of angular momentum assuming a constant luminosity .",
    "as we shall now see , an abrupt change in luminosity has significant consequences regarding the evolution of the spin of the star .",
    "a sudden increase in luminosity can be understood as a result of an atmospheric phase transition , where the atmosphere becomes porous and the effective opacity drops @xcite .",
    "consequently , the radiative flux at the surface becomes greater than the incoming convective flux . in order to compensate for the imbalance , the star must contract while radiating the difference in binding energy @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the luminosities during and before the eruption , respectively .",
    "a more convenient choice of parameters is @xmath75 and @xmath77 ; henceforth , @xmath75 will be denoted by @xmath24 .    in order to keep this discussion as generic as possible , we parametrize the binding energy as @xmath78 and assume a constant @xmath79 , which is generally the case . the time scale for contraction is then @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the kelvin - helmholtz time scale . plugging this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegaevol ] ) gives @xmath82 the contraction terminates when the temperature build up at the core becomes sufficient to generate the required luminosity through nuclear reactions .    in order to estimate how long does the star need to contract",

    "we now show how the theory developed in  [ part1 ] applies to the particular case of . in  [ sec : windapplication ] , it is used to estimate the shape of the sed outflow ejected during the great eruption .",
    "we argue that the homunculus shape is a natural consequence of a star rotating near breakup with sed continuum driven winds . in  [ sec : presentwind ] , we show that the present day wind is sufficiently concentrated towards the poles to spin up the star towards critical rotation , if it is the dominant mode of mass loss . in  [ sec : skirtapp ] , we show that also the formation of an equatorial skirt is expected given the stellar parameters of .",

    ".    we can now estimate ( eq .  [ eq : contractiontime ] ) the contraction time to be @xmath122 to @xmath123 years , depending on the value of @xmath115 , and so the skirt s mass is of the order of @xmath124 .",
    "figure [ fig : skirtmass ] shows the predicted mass of the skirt for different values of @xmath115 and @xmath22 .    throughout this analysis",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that the whole star is instantly affected by the loss of angular momentum to the wind , and",
    "thus the corresponding @xmath125 is constant .",
    "however , during time periods shorter than the time scale of angular momentum diffusion , only an outer shell plays a role in the dynamics . in ",
    "[ sec : angmomdif ] , we show that the diffusion time scale is indeed comparable if not longer than the contraction time . as a result , the effective radius of gyration is larger , and so the mass of the skirt computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdotskirt ] ) is in fact a lower limit .",
    "we conclude that during the initial stages of contraction , a skirt is likely to have formed even for relatively high mass loss rates .",
    "the twin lobe structure of the homunculus nebula of  strongly suggests that either fast rotation or binary interaction played an important role in the process of mass loss . in this work ,",
    "we have chosen to pursue the idea that it is near critical rotation that sculpted the homunculus , and that the mass loss was in the form of a continuum driven wind . the formation of the equatorial skirt is then associated with the evolution of angular momentum before the system settled in a steady state .    as we have seen in ",
    "[ sec : windstheory ] , the structure of such winds can be obtained analytically , if one allows several simplifying assumptions .",
    "in particular , it was assumed that there is no latitudinal interaction between mass and radiative flux elements on different radial trajectories .",

    "implies that the winds of  reach half their terminal velocity already at @xmath126 . for comparison ,",
    "line driven winds reach half their terminal velocity further out , at @xmath127 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] namely , the relevant radial scale is smaller than the latitudinal one ; this acts to suppress lateral fluxes .",
    "by further simplifying the geometry and assuming a spherical star , the set of equations describing all conserved quantities became both algebraically closed and integrable .",
    "obviously , this assumption can not hold since rotation breaks spherical symmetry .",
    "even so , we find that this simple model captures the gross features of the system , as depicted in figure  [ voftheta ] .",
    "mainly , a twin - lobed structure emerges as a generic property of winds from such stars .",
    "the main ingredient required in order to form this structure is that of gravity darkening , as was already pointed out by @xcite and @xcite for line driven winds .",
    "nevertheless , we do expect the oblate geometry to introduce distortion .",
    "for example , the predicted velocity may be lower near the equator , because the wind is launched from larger radii .",
    "this may in fact improve the agreement with the observations .    for the specific case of  (  [ sec : windapplication ] )",
    ", our model provides a rough description of the shape and size of the homunculus nebula .",
    "in particular , continuum driven winds naturally explain the large wind momentum to photon luminosity observed in the homunculus .",
    "such high ratios can not be explained by line driven winds .",
    "note however , that within the approximations and the nominal parameters used , the typical mass of the homunculus obtained is somewhat lower than the value recent observations imply @xcite , and the predicted luminosity is lower by a factor of @xmath128 .",
    "these discrepancies may be reduced by a full numerical analysis .    as a side note ,",
    "we show in  [ sec : spin ] that the angular momentum gain due to a general spin - orbit coupling is correlated with the change in semi - major axis . as a consequence , in light of the high eccentricity of the orbit and stellar parameters assumed , the angular momentum  may have received from interactions with its companion were insufficient to drive it to critical rotation .",
    "the fact that the rotation is very close to critical may seem like fine tuning , but it is quite possible that this is the natural state of the system .",
    "since the star can not sustain high load winds for long periods of time , it is reasonable that a low mass loss rate , as  currently exhibits , is in fact the dominant mode of mass loss .",
    "motivated by this reasoning , we analyzed in  [ sec : spinup ] the explicit solutions for the wind velocity at low mass loss rates .",
    "we found that at equatorial latitudes , the wind stagnates and falls back to the surface , given that the star is rotating fast enough .",
    "the mass loss from pole centered winds , which do reach infinity , dominates over the loss of angular momentum and so the star spins up .. ] this is another aspect of continuum driven winds which is absent from the line driven winds model .",
    "we predict (  [ sec : presentwind ] ) that in about @xmath107 years at the current mass loss rate ,  will be back at critical rotation .",
    "this implies that if the previous large eruption cycle and subsequent wind were similar to the great eruption and the present wind , then the previous large eruption of  must have taken place at least a few thousand years ago .",
    "we then showed in  [ sec : skirttheory ] that at the onset of lbv eruptions , the contraction that follows the atmospheric phase transition is fast enough to render equatorial latitudes unbound , if the star is critically rotating .",
    "the formation of an equatorial skirt is seen to be a generic consequence of the model as well . for the stellar parameters of  (  [ sec : skirtapp ] ) , we predict the skirt s mass to be of the order of @xmath129 .    the effect of angular momentum diffusion , which is discussed in  [ sec : angmomdif ] , complicates the estimation of the mass of the skirt . taking it into account requires a more accurate knowledge of the mass loss to the wind , and specifically its time dependence . essentially , the question is what happened first - did nuclear reactions kick in to stop the contraction or did the loss of angular momentum manage to diffuse inwards and render the formation of a skirt unnecessary ?",

    "the evolution of the orbit is such that the periastron remains fixed while the apastron , @xmath146 , progressively shrinks .",
    "although the orbit may change during periastron passages when the force is applied , the periastron itself must remain part of it .",

    "another way of looking at the orbital evolution is global .",
    "we can compare the angular momentum of two systems having the same periastron , @xmath151 , but one having @xmath152 , and the other an @xmath146 of the present orbit .",
    "in contrast to the previous derivation , a global view can not explain why the perisatron distance remains approximately constant during the evolution .",
