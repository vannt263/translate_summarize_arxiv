    "let @xmath2 denote the unit disk in the riemann sphere @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the closure of @xmath2 .",
    "by @xmath6 we denote the class of all holomorphic univalent functions in @xmath2 normalized by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and by @xmath9 , the class of all univalent meromorphic functions in @xmath10 normalized by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 stands for all functions from @xmath9 with @xmath14 .",
    "these classes have been one of the principal subjects of research in complex analysis for a long time .",
    "the most inquisitive problem for the class @xmath6 posed by l.  bieberbach in 1916 @xcite finally has been solved in 1984 by l.  de  branges @xcite who proved that @xmath15 for any @xmath16 and the equality is attained only for the koebe function @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the main tool of the proof turned out to be a parametric representation of a function from @xmath6 by the lwner homotopic deformation of the identity map given by the _ lwner differential equation_. the parametric method emerged almost 80 years ago in the celebrated paper by k.  lwner @xcite who studied a one - parameter semigroup of conformal one - slit maps of @xmath2 coming then at an evolution equation called after him .",
    "his main achievement was an infinitesimal description of a semi - flow of such maps by the schwarz kernel that led him to the lwner equation .",
    "this crucial result was generalized , then , in several ways .",
    "attempts have been made to derive an equation that allowed to describe a representation of the whole class @xmath6 .",
    "nowadays , it is rather difficult to follow the correct history line of the development of the parametric method because in the middle of the 20-th century a number of works dedicated to this general equation appeared independently . in particular , p.  p.  kufarev @xcite studied a one - parameter family of domains @xmath19 , and regular functions @xmath20 defined in @xmath19 .",
    "he proved differentiability of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath21 for @xmath22 from the carathodory kernel @xmath23 of @xmath19 , and derived a generalization of the lwner equation .",
    "pommerenke @xcite proposed to consider subordination chains of domains that led him to a general evolution equation .",
    "we mention here also papers by v.  gutlyanski @xcite and v.  goryainov @xcite in this direction .",
    "one can learn more about this method in monographs @xcite ( see also the references therein ) .",
    "let us draw reader s attention to goryainov s approach @xcite who suggested to use a method of semigroups to derive several other parametric representations of classes of analytic maps and to apply them to study dynamics of stochastic branching processes .",
    "this approach is based on the study of one - parameter semi - flows on semigroups of conformal maps , their infinitesimal descriptions , and evolution equations ( see also @xcite ) .    in 1959",
    "shah dao - shing @xcite suggested a parametric method for quasiconformal automorphisms of @xmath2 . in another form",
    "this method appeared in the paper by f.  gehring and e.  reich @xcite , and then , in @xcite .",
    "later , cheng qi he @xcite obtained an analogous equation for classes of quasiconformally extendable univalent functions ( to be more precise , in terms of inverse functions ) . unlike the parametric method for conformal maps , its analogue for quasiconformal maps did not receive so much attention .",
    "several attempts have been launched to specialize the lwner - kufarev equation to obtain conformal maps that admit quasiconformal extensions ( see @xcite ) .    surprisingly , an analogous equation appeared in fluid dynamics in the study of plane free boundary problems , where the time dependence of the phase domain @xmath19 in a hele - shaw cell was described by a one - parameter chain of univalent maps satisfying an equation that now is known as the polubarinova - galin equation .",
    "it appeared in the pioneering works by p.  ya .",
    "polubarinova - kochina @xcite and l.  a.  galin @xcite ( see surveys @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the classical lwner - kufarev equation the latter is a non - linear ( even non - quasilinear ) integro - differential equation and many elegant properties of the lwner - kufarev equation are less clear for polubarinova - galin s one .",
    "a typical feature of the hele - shaw flow is that starting with a simply connected phase domain @xmath24 with a smooth boundary possible cusps may be developed during time evolution .",
    "they are caused by vanishing boundary derivatives as well as by topology change .",
    "the principal goal of our paper is to study evolution equations for conformal maps with quasiconformal extensions . in particular ,",
    "we are interested in maps smoothly extendable onto the unit circle .",
    "our approach is based on the study of evolutions on the universal teichmller space @xmath0 and on the manifold @xmath25 embedded into @xmath0 .",
    "another question we are interested in is how a hele - shaw flow is seen on the universal teichmller space as on a general parametric space .",
    "let us consider a _ subordination chain _ of simply connected hyperbolic domains @xmath19 in the riemann sphere @xmath26 , which is defined for @xmath27 .",
    "this means that @xmath28 whenever @xmath29 .",
    "we suppose that all @xmath19 are unbounded and @xmath30 for all @xmath21 . by the riemann mapping theorem",

    "pommerenke @xcite first introduced such chains in order to generalize lwner s equation .",
    "his result says that given a subordination chain of domains @xmath19 defined for @xmath34 with a differentiable real - valued coefficient @xmath35 ( in particular , @xmath36 ) , there exists an analytic regular function @xmath37 such that @xmath38 in @xmath32 and @xmath39 for almost all @xmath34 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath40 is the conformal radius of @xmath19 .",
    "this equation now - a - days is known as the lwner - kufarev equation due to the contribution by k.  lwner @xcite and p.  p.  kufarev @xcite .",
    "we consider two main * questions : *    * if @xmath41 is a quasicircle , what is @xmath42 ? * if @xmath41 is a smooth jordan curve , what is @xmath42 ?",
    "we draw reader s attention to the case of smooth boundaries and their connection to free boundary problems of fluid dynamics . in 1898",
    "h.  s.  hele - shaw @xcite proposed his famous cell that was a device for investigating a flow of viscous fluid in a narrow gap between two parallel plates .",
    "the dimensionless model of a moving viscous incompressible fluid in the hele - shaw cell is described by a potential flow with the velocity field @xmath43 .",
    "the pressure @xmath44 is the potential for the fluid velocity @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the cell gap and @xmath47 is the viscosity of the fluid ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . through the similarity in the governing equations ,",
    "hele - shaw flows can be used to study models of saturated flows in porous media governed by darcy s law . over the years various particular cases of such a flow",
    "have been considered .",
    "different driving mechanisms were employed , such as surface tension or external forces ( suction , injection ) .",
    "we mention here a 600-paper bibliography of free and moving boundary problems for hele - shaw and stokes flows since 1898 up to 1998 collected by k.  a.  gillow and s.  d.  howison @xcite .",
    "since the work by hele - shaw several principal steps have been made . among them we distinguish the papers by p.  ya .",
    "polubarinova - kochina @xcite and l.  a.  galin @xcite who suggested in 1945 a complex variable approach that now is one of the basic tools for investigating the hele - shaw evolution .",
    "let us consider the flow of a viscous fluid in a plane hele - shaw cell under injection through a unique well which is placed at infinity .",
    "suppose that at the initial moment the phase domain @xmath48 occupied by the fluid is simply connected and bounded by a smooth analytic curve @xmath49 .",
    "this model can be thought of as a receding air bubble in a viscous flow .",
    "the evolution of the phase domains @xmath19 is described by an auxiliary conformal mapping @xmath31 of @xmath10 onto @xmath19 , @xmath50 , normalized by @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "here we denote the derivatives by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath21 is the time parameter .",

    "l.  a.  galin @xcite , p.  ya .",
    "polubarinova - kochina @xcite first derived the equation ( [ pg ] ) and stimulated deep investigation in complex variable approach to free boundary problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .    from ( [ pg ] ) one can derive a lwner - kufarev type equation by the schwarz - poisson formula : @xmath56 where @xmath32 .",
    "the equation ( [ pg ] ) is equivalent to the kinematic condition on the free boundary and , in particular , implies that the phase domains @xmath19 form a subordination chain . in contrary to the classical lwner - kufarev equation ( [ lkp ] ) the equation ( [ pgl ] ) even is not quasilinear and the problem of the short - time existence and uniqueness of the solution is much more difficult .",
    "first it was proved by yu .",
    "p.  vinogradov , p.  p.  kufarev @xcite in 1948 and later in 1993 by m.  reissig , l.  von wolfersdorf @xcite .",
    "in fact , starting with a smooth domain @xmath48 the solution to ( [ pg ] ) exists and unique locally in time .",
    "it is known that the domains @xmath19 remain to have smooth ( even analytic ) boundaries up to the time @xmath57 when possible cusps are developed or the domain fails to be simply connected .",

    "let us consider the family @xmath59 of all quasiconformal automorphisms of @xmath2 .",

    "two normalized maps @xmath67 and @xmath68 are said to be equivalent , @xmath69 , if being extended onto the unit circle @xmath70 , the superposition @xmath71 restricted to @xmath70 is the identity map .",
    "the quotient set @xmath72 is called _ the universal teichmller space _ @xmath0 .",
    "it is a covering space for all teichmller spaces of analytically finite riemann surfaces . by definition",
    "we have two realizations of @xmath0 : as a set of equivalence classes of quasiconformal maps and , due to the relation between @xmath72 and the unit ball @xmath73 , as a set of equivalence classes of corresponding beltrami coefficients .",
    "the normalized maps from @xmath59 form a group @xmath74 with respect to superposition and the maps that act identically on @xmath70 form a normal subgroup @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is the quotient of @xmath76 .",

    "let us denote by @xmath80\\in t$ ] the equivalence class represented by @xmath78 .",

    "we normalize the corresponding quasiconformal map @xmath60 , which is conformal in @xmath10 , by @xmath89 about infinity .",
