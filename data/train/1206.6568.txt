    "independently of @xmath13 , we give ourselves a family @xmath3 of independent random variables , which we may call the _ potential _ , or also the _ environment_. these random variables are distributed according to a common probability measure @xmath14 on @xmath4 .",
    "we write @xmath15 for their joint distribution , and @xmath16 for the associated expectation .",
    "let @xmath17 be a vector of unit euclidian norm , and @xmath18 be the first time at which the random walk crosses the hyperplane orthogonal to  @xmath19 lying at distance @xmath20 from the origin .",
    "our main goal is to study the _ quenched _ and _ annealed _ point - to - hyperplane _ lyapunov norms _ ( also called _ lyapunov exponents _ ) , defined respectively by @xmath21,\\ ] ] @xmath22,\\ ] ] for @xmath5 tending to @xmath7 ( the first limit holds almost surely ; see @xcite for proofs that these exponents are well defined ) .",
    "intuitively , these two quantities measure the cost , at the exponential scale , of travelling from the origin to a distant hyperplane , for the random walk penalized by the potential @xmath2 .",
    "the quenched lyapunov norm is a measure of this cost in a typical random environment , while the annealed lyapunov norm measures this cost after averaging over the randomness of the environment .",
    "these norms are related to the point - to - point lyapunov norms by duality , and to the large deviation rate function for the position of the random walk at a large time under the weighted measure ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "recently , @xcite studied this question under the additional assumption that @xmath23 $ ] is finite ( where we write @xmath23 $ ] as shorthand for @xmath24 $ ] ) .",

    "this means that when @xmath23 $ ] is finite , the first - order asymptotics of the lyapunov exponents are the same as if the potential were non - random and uniformly equal to @xmath23 $ ] .",

    "an interesting feature of and is that their right - hand sides do not depend on @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "asymptotically , the balls associated to the quenched and annealed lyapunov norms look like scaled euclidian balls .",
    "the main motivation behind @xcite was related to questions concerning the spectrum of the discrete anderson hamiltonian @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the discrete laplacian : @xmath50 powerful techniques have been devised to transfer finite - volume estimates on the green function of @xmath51 within some energy interval into information on the spectrum in this interval ( see @xcite for the multiscale method , and @xcite for the fractional - moment approach ) .",
    "for instance , it is known that for any @xmath5 , the spectrum of @xmath51 is pure point in a neighbourhood of @xmath7 and corresponding eigenfunctions are exponentially localized . in @xcite , extending the techniques developed in @xcite , the author gave quantitative estimates on the green function within an explicit energy interval at the edge of the spectrum , as  @xmath6 tends to @xmath7 .",
    "these were then refined in @xcite .",
    "these results imply in particular that if @xmath23 $ ] is finite and the distribution @xmath14 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , then for any @xmath52 and any  @xmath6 small enough , the spectrum of @xmath51 is pure point in the interval @xmath53-\\beta\\eta]$ ] , with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions .",
    "theorem  [ t : estimen ] can be seen as a first step towards a study of these questions in the case when the potential is not assumed to be integrable .",
    "we conjecture that when this integrability condition is dropped , the upper energy @xmath54 $ ] appearing in the above result should be relaced by @xmath55 the reason why this is the natural integral to consider will be explained in section  [ s : extension ] .",
    "we now give a heuristic description of the typical scenario responsible for the behaviour of @xmath56 described in theorem  [ t : estimen ] .",
    "different strategies can be used to reduce the cost of travel to the distant hyperplane .",
    "( 1 ) one approach is to reach the hyperplane in a small number of steps .",
    "( 2 ) a second approach is to avoid sites where @xmath57 is too large , or else , to try not to return to such sites too many times .",
    "naturally , one should look for the optimal strategy as a combination of these two methods .    in order to quantify method ( 1 )",

    "\\gtrsim    { \\mathfrak}{i}{_\\beta}\\ \\frac{n}{v},\\ ] ] which quantifies the gains obtained by method ( 2 ) .",
    "assuming that these observations hold , theorem  [ t : estimen ] can be derived by optimizing  @xmath58 so that the sum of the costs in ( [ met1 ] ) and ( [ met2 ] ) is minimized .",
    "this is achieved choosing @xmath61 let us explain the meaning of .",
    "recall that for any @xmath62 , holds .",
    "relation shows that sites whose potential is bounded by @xmath62 contribute as if they were replaced by their expectation . in other words , for these sites , method  ( 2 ) is simply too costly to be effective , and we may say that these sites are in a `` law of large numbers '' regime .",
    "in fact , in this reasoning , we could allow @xmath62 to grow with  @xmath6 , as long as it remains small compared to @xmath63 .",
    "the picture changes when we consider sites whose potential is very large compared to @xmath63 .",
    "observe that the number of distinct sites visited by the random walk at time @xmath64 grows like @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the mean number of visits to any point visited ( conditionally on the event @xmath67 , this is true in the limit of small  @xmath58 ) . under the annealed measure , the sequence of potentials attached to the distinct sites visited forms a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with common distribution  @xmath14 .",
    "the cost of not meeting any site whose potential lies in the interval @xmath68 up to time @xmath67 is thus approximately @xmath69 when @xmath62 is large , since @xmath70 as @xmath43 tends to infinity , this is roughly @xmath71 and thus the strategy concerning sites whose potential is much larger than @xmath63 is simple to describe : simply avoid them .    to sum up , formula ( [ met2 ] )",
    "reveals the following picture .",
    "sites whose potential is much smaller than @xmath63 stay in a law of large numbers regime .",
    "sites whose potential is much greater than @xmath63 are simply avoided .",
    "now , for sites whose potential is of order @xmath63 , an adequate intermediate strategy is found .",
    "heuristically , for sites whose potential is roughly @xmath72 , the strategy consists in ( i ) lowering the proportion of such sites that are visited by a factor @xmath73 ; ( ii ) once on such a site , to go back to it with a probability @xmath74 instead of @xmath75 .",
    "the picture described above , and in particular , must however be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "our basic approach relies on coarse - graining arguments .",
    "we identify _ good _ boxes , which are such that we understand well the cost and the exit distribution of a coarse - grained displacement of the walk started from a point in a good box . in our arguments",
    ", we do not try to control what happens when a coarse - grained piece of trajectory starts within a _ bad _ box .",
    "as was noted in @xcite , this is indeed a delicate matter , since the time spent in bad boxes does not have finite exponential moments in general .",
    "instead , we introduce a _ surgery _ on the trajectories .",
    "the surgery consists in removing certain _ loops _ , which are pieces of coarse - grained trajectory that start and end in the same bad box .",
    "we show rigorous versions of and , where @xmath76 is replaced by the total time spent outside of these loops ; from these estimates , we then derive theorem  [ t : estimen ] .    * related works .",
    "* we already mentioned @xcite and the connection with anderson localization .    in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that under the annealed weighted measure , the random walk conditioned to hit a distant hyperplane satisfies a law of large numbers ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether their techniques can be combined with our present estimate to show that indeed , the right - hand side of   gives the asymptotic behaviour of the speed as @xmath6 tends to @xmath7 ( our results do not show this directly , due to the surgery on paths discussed above ) .",
    "another motivation relates to recent investigation on whether the disorder is _ weak _ of _ strong_. the disorder is said to be weak if the quenched and annealed lyapunov exponents coincide . to our knowledge , this question has only been investigated for potentials of the form @xmath77 with @xmath78 , see @xcite for weak disorder results when @xmath79 and @xmath6 is small , and @xcite for strong disorder results when @xmath80 .",
    "this additional @xmath78 is very convenient since it introduces an effective drift towards the target hyperplane ( indeed , the problem can be rewritten in terms of a drifted random walk in the potential @xmath2 using a girsanov transform ) . in particular",
    ", the asymptotic speed of travel to the hyperplane remains bounded away from @xmath7 in this case .",
    "one of our motivations was to get a better understanding of the behaviour of the walk when we set @xmath81 .",
    "of course , showing that the lyapunov exponents are equivalent as @xmath6 tends to @xmath7 does not touch upon the question whether they become equal for small @xmath6 or not .",
    "recently , a continuous - space version of @xcite was obtained in @xcite . there",
    ", the author investigates brownian motion up to reaching a unit ball at distance @xmath20 from the starting point , and evolving in a potential formed by locating a given compactly supported bounded function @xmath82 at each point of a homogeneous poisson point process of intensity @xmath83 .",
    "it is shown that if @xmath84 for some constant  @xmath85 , then the quenched and annealed lyapunov exponents are both asymptotically equivalent to @xmath86 .",
    "* organization of the paper .",
    "* as was apparent in the informal description above , the most interesting phenomena occur for sites whose associated potential is of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "section  [ s : lowerbd ] adresses this case , and proves theorem  [ t : estimen ] with @xmath87 replaced by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is arbitrary .",
    "this is however not sufficient to prove theorem  [ t : estimen ] in full generality , since for some distributions [ and although we always assume ] , it may be that whatever @xmath89 , the integral @xmath90 is too small compared to @xmath87 as @xmath6 tends to @xmath7 . in other words , there are cases for which the integral @xmath91 can not be neglected , even if we are free to choose @xmath89 beforehand . in the very short section  [ s : intermediate ] ,",
    "we take a specific choice for @xmath92 and distinguish between three cases , depending on whether @xmath90 , @xmath93 , or both integrals have to be considered .",
    "section  [ s : intermediate2 ] tackles the most delicate case when both integrals must be accounted for .",
    "section  [ s : intermediate_only ] concludes the proof of theorem  [ t : estimen ] , covering the case when @xmath90 is negligible compared to @xmath93 .",
    "finally , section  [ s : extension ] presents natural extensions of theorem  [ t : estimen ] , and spells out the link with the green function of the operator @xmath8 .",
