    "the spectral representation of the correlation functions of the vector current directly relates to the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons and photons .",
    "additionally in the limit of small frequencies it determines a transport coefficient , in the case of the vector correlation function of light quarks , the electrical conductivity .",
    "+ at temperatures relevant for current heavy ion experiments non - perturbative techniques are mandatory for the determination of these quantities .",
    "perturbative studies of the vector spectral functions @xcite and also the inclusion of non - perturbative aspects through the hard thermal loop resummation scheme @xcite break down , especially in the low invariant mass region , indicated by an infrared divergent euclidean correlator @xcite , leading to an infinite electrical conductivity",
    ". however it could be demonstrated that the spectral function at low invariant masses in fact increases linearly resulting in a finite electrical conductivity of the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "this behavior could also be established by previous work using lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "+ in @xcite we analyzed the vector correlation function at @xmath1 and performed its extrapolation to the continuum limit based on precise data at various lattice sizes , corresponding to different lattice cutoffs .",
    "we then obtained reliable results for the determination of the spectral properties and the extraction of the dilepton rates and transport coefficients . here",
    "we report on a first extension of this work to a wider temperature range and present results on the electrical conductivity in the temperature region @xmath0 .",
    "the desired information is encoded in the large distance region of temporal euclidean correlation functions of the vector current at non - zero temperature and fixed spatial momentum , @xmath2    whereby the current - current correlation functions can be represented in terms of an integral over spectral functions , @xmath3 : @xmath4 here we denote by @xmath5 the sum over the three space - space components of the spectral function and also introduce the vector spectral function @xmath6 .",
    "+ the time - time component of the vector correlation function , @xmath7 , is conserved and can be shown to be proportional to the quark number susceptibility , @xmath8 . the vector correlation functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 therefore differ only by a constant , @xmath11    at high temperature and for large energies corrections to the free field behavior can be calculated perturbatively ; the vector spectral function can be deduced from the calculation of one loop corrections to the leading order results for the thermal dilepton rate @xcite .",
    "this yields , @xmath12    in the free field , infinite temperature limit the spatial part of the spectral function contains a @xmath13-function at the origin .",
    "different from the time - time component , where the @xmath13-function is protected by current conservation , this @xmath13-function is smeared out at finite temperature and the low energy part of @xmath5 is expected to be described by a breit - wigner peak @xcite , @xmath14 the limit @xmath15 is sensitive to transport properties in the thermal medium and in this case it leads to the electrical conductivity @xmath16 the breit - wigner form then yields @xmath17 . note here that in the infinite temperature limit the width of the breit - wigner peak vanishes , while at the same time @xmath18 , @xmath19 and consequently the electrical conductivity is infinite in the non - interacting case .",
    "+ these considerations give rise to a sensible ansatz describing the high temperature vector spectral function : @xmath20 this ansatz depends on four temperature dependent parameters ; the quark number susceptibility @xmath21 , the strength ( @xmath22 ) and width ( @xmath23 ) of the breit - wigner peak and the parameter @xmath24 that parametrizes deviations from a free spectral function at large energies .",
    "+ in the following we will use this ansatz to extract the electrical conductivity and the vector spectral function from the correlator data .",
    "in addition to the vector correlation function itself we will calculate its curvature at the largest euclidean time separation accessible at non - zero temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath25 .",
    "the curvature is the second thermal moment of the spectral functions at vanishing momentum , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is chosen to be even as all odd moments vanish .",
    "these thermal moments give the taylor expansion coefficients for the correlation function expanded around the mid - point of the euclidean time interval , @xmath28    in the infinite temperature , free field limit the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : speccora ] can be evaluated analytically @xcite and one straight forwardly obtains the first three non - vanishing moments for massless quarks @xmath29 note here that all thermal moments , @xmath30 with @xmath31 , will be sensitive to the smeared @xmath13-function contributing to @xmath32 although we expect this contribution to become more and more suppressed in higher order moments @xcite .",
    "+ in the following we will analyze the ratio of @xmath33 and the free field correlator @xmath34 , @xmath35 as well as the ratio of mid - point subtracted correlation functions @xmath36 here we used the notation @xmath37 . note that the curvature of these ratios at the mid - point determines the deviation of ratios of thermal moments from the corresponding free field values .",
    "while the ratios of correlation functions differ in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels due to the additional constant contributing to @xmath40 , this constant drops out in the subtracted correlation function , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    ".parameters for the calculation of vector correlation functions on lattices of size @xmath44 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to discuss the consequences of our findings on the vector spectral function we invoke the breit - wigner+continuum ansatz defined in eq.[eq : ansatz ] and fit to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 data respecting also the thermal moments .",
    "additionally we analyze the dependence of the fit parameters on @xmath47 , as , with the data being subject to potentially large lattice effects , we expect large errors originating from the fit - window we choose .",
    "the resulting parameters are summarized in tab.[tab : fit - tdep ] .",
    "+ here it can be seen that the results at @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the largest errors , nevertheless these results should be closest to those in the continuum as only the furthest distance points are comparatively free of lattice effects . without a continuum extrapolation",
    "however it is at this point not possible to cleanly discern the residual deviation due to the lattice cut - off .",
    "decreasing @xmath47 on the other hand leads to visible systematic trends in the parameters , as such the correction term @xmath50 and the width @xmath51 both increase with decreasing @xmath47 , while the electrical conductivity decreases .",
    "additionally the @xmath52 increases with decreasing @xmath47 implying a lower quality fit with lower @xmath47 . in light of the argument above these results",
    "show that indeed the lattice effects influence the fit more strongly with smaller @xmath47 , as they can not be taken care of by the employed ansatz .",
    "consequently we attribute the largest part of the systematic trends observed above to the lattice effects .",
    "+ focusing on the parameters themselves note that the correction factor @xmath24 is the most accurately determined .",
    "clearly it shows an increasing trend with decreasing temperature differing by a factor @xmath53 between @xmath46 and @xmath54 .",
    "however as @xmath24 is coupled to the strong coupling via @xmath55 @xcite , this behavior is expected . the same can be seen for the width @xmath56 and the parameter @xmath57 , they also slightly increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "however here , they remain within errors of each other and the increase between @xmath46 and @xmath54 is small .",
    "naturally this also leads to only small deviations of the electrical conductivity .",
    "note however that the results at @xmath58 differ by @xmath59 from those of @xmath60 , while this deviation is only @xmath61 for @xmath62 . with the @xmath58 lattice being most affected by the systematics of the fit , we assume the largest part of this deviation to find its origins there .",
    "even so we find the electrical conductivity to be to a good degree constant and within @xmath63 across the temperature region evaluated here , whereby the values at the individual temperatures have fit errors around @xmath64 .",
    "+ in the temperature range @xmath0 our results therefore imply that the electrical conductivity depends linearly on temperature as expected from perturbation theory @xcite and at @xmath65 we find the value : @xmath66 whereby the first error quoted corresponds to the temperature effects and the second to the fit errors .",
    "extending our earlier study we presented results on the vector correlation function in the high temperature phase of quenched qcd in the temperature range @xmath0 .",
    "first results show a similar behavior to those extensively analyzed at @xmath67 and even at @xmath54 we find no sizable contribution attributable to the @xmath68-resonance . +",
    "even though these calculations could not yet be extended to include also a continuum extrapolation as in @xcite , we were nevertheless able to extract the relevant spectral properties to calculate the electrical conductivity via an ansatz and found this phenomenologically relevant transport coefficient to depend linearly on temperature with a value of @xmath69 . + given the exact relation between the electrical conductivity and the diffusion constant , @xmath70 , it would be interesting to compare these results with those obtained in the case of charm diffusion @xcite or from the momentum diffusion constant @xmath71 calculable via hqet @xcite and we will do so in an upcoming publication .    99 -2pt h. t. ding .",
