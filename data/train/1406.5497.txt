    "in recent years it has been discovered that bound states for one - electron systems with three / four protons exist in nature in presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite . in particular , for the molecular ion @xmath7 it has been shown that the geometrical configuration changes depending on the field strength , being an equilateral triangle for @xmath8 g@xmath9 g and linear for @xmath10 g @xmath11 g. systems with more than three protons also exist in presence of such strong fields , but the only linear configurations parallel to the field seems to be optimal . other other geometrical configuration might exist in such circumstances but have not been studied , so far . in a very naive way of thinking",
    "a clue to find other configurations is to assume the proton to have a non - integer charge . although the physics behind this two phenomena are totally different , it is possible that for a given field strength there will be a preferred direction for which a geometrical configuration , different from linear , might be realized .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it is presented the case of one - electron systems with charged centers @xmath12 , @xmath13 , turned out that there are bound states for positive charges less that a certain critical one , @xmath14 , with non - linear optimal geometrical configuration .    a restriction to integer values of charges",
    "do not appear in classical electrodynamics and not even in more advanced theories such as the theory of atomic - molecular physics , it is only in elementary particle physics  @xcite where a justification for the existence of integer charge appears . in classical electrostatics where",
    "stable configurations of point charges are known to be absent ( earnshaw s theorem ) , zero charge is a singular point where the nature of interaction changes from repulsion to attraction . usually , at a singular charge the whole or some part of the potential vanishes .",
    "this behavior is not exclusive of classical physics , it also can be found in non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics where these singular charges exist as well .",
    "however , a new phenomenon occurs - there are some critical charges which separate the domain of the existence of the bound states from the domain of non - existence , although the nature of the potential remains unchanged . in some cases",
    "a system gets bound at a critical charge with polynomialy - decaying eigenfunctions at large distances , unlike standard exponentially - decaying eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "the well - known examples where such a transition , of existence to non - existence , occurs are the square - well of finite depth , the pschl - teller potential and the yukawa potential . about coulomb molecular systems , there are some works related to molecular ion @xmath15 with non - integer charge @xcite . for more than two charged centers and one electron ,",
    "the first study was presented in @xcite for @xmath13 : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where critical charges were calculated .",
    "the optimal geometric configurations were found to correspond to platonic solids ; a line for @xmath16 , an equilateral triangle for @xmath17 and a regular tetrahedron for @xmath18 .",
    "for all studied systems , both atomic and molecular , the total energy has a square - root branch point with exponent @xmath6 at @xmath5 .",
    "this work can be considered as a continuation of work @xcite addressing five and six infinitely massive centers of the same charge @xmath0 and one electron .",
    "one of the goals is to find the possible optimal geometrical configuration for which the system is realized .",
    "another goal is to identify the domain(s ) in @xmath0 where the system is bound , focusing on the critical charges @xmath19 which separate the domains of existence / non - existence of bound state .",
    "this study is performed in the framework of non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "atomic units @xmath20 are used throughout , but energies are given in rydbergs .",
    "let us consider a coulomb molecular system which consists of @xmath21 fixed charges @xmath0 and one electron , @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes this system as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the distance between charge centers @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the distance from the electron to @xmath24th charge center .    from a physical point of view",
    ", it is clear that such a system is not bound , both for large positive and for negative @xmath0 values .",
    "however , it has to be bound at small @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that there must be a critical charge which separates the domains of existence and non - existence of a bound state ; one such a critical charge is @xmath28 , the other one is at some finite @xmath0 , @xmath5 , which does not represent any type of singularity of operator .",
    "it is worth noting that it is possible to describe the same problem by considering that the charged centers have positive charge equal to the unity and the electron has negative charge greater than one .    in order to calculate the total energy @xmath29 we use the variational method .",
    "we employ a physics - inspired trial functions .",
    "the choice of the trial function is based on arguments of physical relevance , i.e. the trial function should support the symmetries of the system , has to reproduce the coulomb singularities and the asymptotic behavior at large distances adequately ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider five fixed charges @xmath0 and one electron .",
    "there is an infinite number of configurations for this system , but only one that is optimal .",
    "it is impossible to study all configurations but it is a good guess to consider the most symmetric ones .",
    "three particular configurations were studied : pentagon , square pyramid and triangular dipyramid . for the pentagon configuration , protons were located on the the edges of the figure , defining the @xmath30 plane with origin in the centroid , and @xmath31 the distance between two adjacent protons . in the square pyramid configuration four protons were placed on the corners of a square of side @xmath31 , defining the @xmath30 plane with its sides parallel to the axes ; the fifth proton is placed on the @xmath32axis perpendicular to the square .",
    "finally the triangular dipyramid configuration is given by three centers forming an equilateral triangle of side @xmath33 and two others which are symmetrically placed perpendicular to the triangle coming through its center with distance @xmath34 between them .",
    "the variational method is used to obtain all numerical results .",
    "the trial function is taken in a form of a symmetrized product of five @xmath35-coulomb orbitals ( slater functions ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the symmetrizer with respect a permutation of the charged centers .",
    "after doing permutations the trial function contains 120 terms .",
    "the function ( [ trial5ze ] ) depends on five @xmath38 variational parameters .",
    "it is expected that this type of function gives results with an accuracy of @xmath39 in the total energy .    in order to find these critical charges , curves of the total energy as function of the charge",
    "can be obtained for the three different configurations , see fig [ 5zeconfigs ] .",
    "calculations show that critical charges are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for pentagon , square pyramid and triangle dipyramid , respectively .",
    "the curves also show that the most stable geometrical configuration is given by the triangular dipyramid , see fig .",
    "[ 5ze ] .        for the optimal geometrical configuration , the triangular dipyramid , it is possible to find the domains of metastability ; i.e. points where systems begin to have decay channels .",
    "these domains are given by crossing points between one - electron and @xmath21 @xmath0-charged systems , @xmath12 .",
    "[ e : nz+e ] shows curves of the total energy as function of the charge , @xmath29 , for systems @xmath43 ( as reference curve ) , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , all taken in the optimal configuration .",
    "thus , for charges @xmath44 the system is metastable with two decay channels @xmath45 for @xmath46 the system is metastable with one decay channel @xmath47 and finally for @xmath48 the system is stable .    beyond determining the critical charge , it is important to understand the behavior of the energy , as function of the charge , close to critically . in this way it turns out that this behavior is described by means of a puiseux expansion @xmath49 with the condition that @xmath50 .",
    "the goal is to find parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 of this expansion .",
    "restricting the expansion ( [ pui ] ) to a finite number of terms a fit of the total energy calculated numerically . by making the fit it is found , in particular , that exponents @xmath52 are very close to @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) ; then",
    ", it is convenient to assume @xmath55 and only determine the coefficients @xmath51 .",
    "the fit is based on data in the domain @xmath56 ( 10 points ) .",
    "this behavior indicates that critical point might be a square - root branch point . @xmath57 where the critical point is @xmath58    for the critical point @xmath28 ( which is the singular point of the schrdinger equation ) , we study the behavior of the energy as function of the charge .",
    "the behavior on the energy ( @xmath59 with 15 points ) is given by a taylor expansion : @xmath60 such a behavior does not provide an indication of a singular nature at @xmath28 .",
    "however , the total energy can not be analytically continued to @xmath61 .",
    "table [ fitcorr5ze ] shows a comparison between the results of the energy fit and fit near critical charges @xmath5 , @xmath28 , correspondingly , and data .    .",

    "[ 6zedistances ] presents curves for the distances ( height @xmath62 , and radius of circumscribed circle @xmath63 ) as functions of the charge @xmath0 for the geometrical configuration of the system ( octahedron ) .    from fig . [",
    "6zedistances ] we see that the optimal geometrical configuration is an octahedron , where the height @xmath62 is always smaller than the radius of circumscribed circle @xmath63 .",
    "this tell us that the charges are placed on a oblate spheroid with semi - axes @xmath63 , see fig.[elipse6ze ] .",
    "in this paper we calculated for the first time the critical charges for two molecular systems : @xmath1 and @xmath64 .",
    "for all those systems the total energy and equilibrium distances vs. @xmath0 are smooth curves without any indication of charge quantization .",
    "moreover the optimal geometric configuration seems to be always the maximally symmetric : a triangular dipyramid for @xmath1 and an octahedron for @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to mention that the behavior near the critical charge of the total energy as a function of the charge , @xmath29 , indicates a square - root branch point with exponent 3/2 .",
    "this agrees with the previous results found for various atomic and molecular systems @xcite .",
