    "since the cr concentrations in our bafe@xmath3ni@xmath1cr@xmath9as@xmath2 samples are less than 2 % , we believe that the magnetic structure in the cr - doped samples are the same as that of the undoped compounds .",
    "moreover , in our recent collaborative measurements by angle - resolved - photoemission - spectroscopy ( arpes ) and thermal conductivity , we have found the band structure and fermi surfaces are barely changed upon doping cr into bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 with same ni concentration , except for weak localization effects of charge carriers and suppression of @xmath5 @xcite .",
