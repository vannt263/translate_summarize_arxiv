    "the theoretical description of the thermoelectric response of correlated materials is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics , and a breakthrough in this area has potential technological useful implications .",
    "@xcite the materials , which have been studied as likely candidates for useful thermoelectric properties , are mostly semiconductor alloys and compounds .",
    "materials such as bi@xmath0te@xmath1/sb@xmath0te@xmath1 and si - ge , which are currently favoured for room temperature application , belong to this category .",
    "another class of materials , with potentially useful thermoelectric properties , are ce and la filled skutterudites such as lafe@xmath1cosb@xmath2 and cefe@xmath1cosb@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite theoretically these materials have been studied successfully using band theory .",
    "@xcite recently mahan and sofo  @xcite have shown that the best thermoelectric materials could well be correlated metals and semiconductors ( i.e. , rare earth intermetallic compounds ) .",
    "the development of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)[for reviews see refs . 4 , 5 ] has allowed new studies of the effects of correlation on the thermoelectric response using this method on model hamiltonians .",
    "@xcite more recent combinations of band theory and many - body methods such as the lda+dmft method  @xcite [ for reviews see refs .",
    "10 , 11 ] or the lda++ method  @xcite offers the exciting possibility of predicting the thermoelectric properties of materials starting from first principles .",
    "@xcite this revival of interest in the thermoelectric response motivates us to re - analyze in this paper the following issues : ( 1 ) what is the form of the thermal current and the charge current which should be used in realistic calculations , and ( 2 ) how it should be approximated in a dmft calculation .",
    "the first question is subtle for two reasons .",
    "first , as noted early on by jonson and mahan ,  @xcite the electronic part of the thermal current operator contains a quadratic and a quartic piece ( if the electron - electron interaction is non - local ) in the electron creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the contribution of this quartic interaction term to the current has continued to be the subject of discussion .",
    "@xcite second , while the form of the thermal current and the charge current in the continuum is unambiguous , and can be calculated using noether s theorem ,  @xcite dmft calculations require the projection of these currents on a restricted lattice model .",
    "this involves the computation of complicated matrix elements , and in practice an approximation which is analogous to the peierls substitution  @xcite for the electrical current is carried out .",
    "it is well known that the results of this construction depend on the basis set of orbitals used .",
    "@xcite this raises the practical question of how to optimize the basis of orbitals to be used in transport calculations .",
    "the second question is subtle due to the presence of interaction terms in the current .",
    "this raises the issue of how it should be simplified in the evaluation of the various current - current correlation functions and the transport coefficients .",
    "this question was first addressed by schweitzer and czycholl  @xcite and by pruschke and collaborators  @xcite who stated that _ within the relaxation time approximation _ , this term can be expressed in terms of a time derivative , and the vertex corrections can be ignored . in the review of georges _",
    "@xcite it was stated that the results of pruschke _ et .",
    "hold beyond the relaxation time approximation in the limit of large dimensionality when dmft becomes exact but no detailed proof of this statement was presented .",
    "the following are our main results .",
    "( 1 ) in section ii we address the question of the optimization of the basis of localized orbitals for transport calculations , following the ideas of marzari and vanderbilt .",
    "@xcite for completeness and for pedagogical reasons we discuss in parallel work on the charge current , which is simpler and better understood  @xcite than the thermal current .",
    "our conclusions in this context have applications for the computation of born charges in empirical tight - binding models .",
    "@xcite ( 2 ) in section iii we derive the form of the thermal current to be used in tight - binding models , and its dependence on the orbitals , using the equation of motion technique introduced in ref . 24 .",
    "our final expression differs in one term from the results of ref .",
    "( 3 ) in section iv we describe in detail the diagrammatic analysis of correlation functions of the current operators .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly that in the dmft limit of the transport calculation , the vertex corrections ( even for those involving the thermal current ) can be completely neglected , thereby justifying the current practice used in all previous dmft work .",
    "we consider a system of electrons in a periodic potential @xmath3 , in the presence of an external vector potential @xmath4 , and with coulomb interaction between them .",
    "the lagrangian is given by    l = & & d^3 r ( - ps . ) + d^3 r ( - ie ( r ) ) ^2 ps . - d^3 r v(r ) ps .",
    "+ & & - d^3r d^3 ( ) ( ) ps . ( ) ps . ( ) .    here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron field operators with usual anticommutation properties .",
    "we have ignored the spin of the electrons only to simplify the notation . including spin in the following analysis is quite straightforward . in field theory , when both high and low energy degrees of freedom are retained , noether s theorem provides a robust procedure to identify the various currents .",
    "@xcite the theorem associates with every symmetry of the action a conserved charge and a corresponding current .",
    "the charge current is determined by the invariance of the action @xmath7 , under @xmath8 gauge transformation given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the transformation does not produce any variation from the interaction term , and the well known expression for the charge current is = - d^3r ( ) ( - ie ( r ) ) ps .",
    "the above expression is gauge invariant .",
    "the part which is proportional to the vector potential gives the diamagnetic current .    in order to facilitate further discussion",
    "we will perform the standard noether construction in the wannier basis . in this basis",
    "the action ( which includes both low and high energy degrees of freedom ) is    s = dt & & \\ { _ n ( c_n^ _ n^ - _ n^ c_n^ ) -_n m t_n m^ c_n^ c_m^ + _ n m l _ n l^ _",

    "form a complete set of orthonormal wannier functions .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the anticommutation relation @xmath18 .",
    "the gauge transformation of the fermionic field operators is equivalent to the variation @xmath19 and @xmath20 . expanding @xmath21 about the point @xmath16 and keeping only up to @xmath22 term ( which is all we need to construct the noether current ) we get c_n^ & = & i ( _ n ) c_n^ + i _ m _ nm ^ c_m^ , + c_n^ & = & -i ( _ n ) c_n^ - i _ m c_m^ _ mn^ , where @xmath23 are the connection coefficients .",

    "we can identify the charge current as    & = & ie _ nm ( _ m - _ n ) t_nm^ c_n^ c_m^ + ie _ nml c_n^ ( t_nl^ _ lm^ - _ nl^ t_lm^ ) c_m^ - _ nm _",

    "nm c_n^ c_m^ n | [ _ 0 ( ) , ] | m .",
    "this is just equation ( 2 ) expressed in the wannier basis .",
    "the charge current is related to the electronic polarization operator  @xcite @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "the change in polarization @xmath31 ( which is a well defined and measurable bulk quantity , rather than polarization itself ) between an initial and a final state of a sample is the integrated current flowing through the sample during an adiabatic transformation connecting the two states .",
    "@xcite    theoretical models of the tight - binding type are effective low energy models described in terms of those bands which are close to the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite the question , which is non - trivial and which is still debated , is what should be the form of the current for such low energy models .",
    "the low energy hamiltonian is obtained by eliminating or integrating out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the high energy bands .",
    "this is easily formulated in the functional integral language and the procedure generates many interaction terms that are not present in the original action . in a hamiltonian formulation",
    "this is equivalent to making a canonical transformation to decouple the low energy and the high energy sectors .",
    "@xcite that is , given a full many body hamiltonian @xmath32 , we perform unitary transformation @xmath33 such that @xmath34 is diagonal ( for a system of interacting particles , in general , this can be done only approximately ) , and then consider only @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the operator projecting on the low energy bands . to obtain the expression for the current in the low energy sector one has to perform the same canonical transformation used to transform the original hamiltonian into the effective hamiltonian on the operator representing the current . in other words , we first calculate the current ( say , @xmath37 ) for the full theory ( using the symmetry of the full theory ) , make the same unitary transformation and then project the current on the low energy sector of interest . the exact low energy current is then given by @xmath38 .",
    "this method of calculating the current for the low energy theory is motivated by renormalization group ideas .",
    "but , to implement this in practice is usually a formidable task .",
    "however , if we consider a system of non - interacting electrons ( in a periodic potential ) with a subset @xmath39 of bands that defines the low energy subspace , the low energy current is obtained by projecting the full current in eqn .",
    "( 5 ) on the low energy subspace .",
    "this is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the projection operator .",
    "we note that the calculation of the exact current requires knowledge of the matrix elements of the position operator in addition to that of @xmath42 ( the tight - binding parameters ) .",
    "@xcite    sometimes , to avoid calculating the matrix elements of the position operator , one makes the approximation known as peierls substitution .",
    "there are two types of approximations involved with this procedure .",
    "first , terms involving the connection coefficients are dropped out , and one considers an approximate gauge transformation given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 . putting the connection coefficients to zero is equivalent to the approximation @xmath45 for the matrix elements of the position operator , and @xmath46 | m \\nu \\ra \\approx i m ( \\vr_m - \\vr_n ) t_{nm}^{\\mu \\nu}$ ] for the matrix elements of the momentum operator . second , with this approximate gauge transformation , the variation from the interaction term is non - zero ( though , as already noted , it is zero for the exact gauge transformation ) .",
    "however , contribution to the current from the interaction term is neglected .",
    "it will be further assumed that the vector potential is constant , i.e. , @xmath47 . with these simplifications the approximate current ( @xmath48 )",
    "is given by    _",
    "p = ie _ nm m ( _",
    "m - _ n ) t_nm^ c_n^ c_m^ + e^2 _ nm",
    "m(_m - _ n ) ( ( _ m - _ n ) ) t_nm^ c_n^ c_m^ .    the second term is the approximate diamagnetic contribution .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath48 lies in the fact that it can be calculated from the tight - binding parameters alone .",
    "the construction of the peierls current in terms of the atomic orbitals is _ a priori _ not obvious for the case when there is more than one atom per unit cell .",
    "it is worthwhile to clarify this issue here .",
    "we will denote the atomic wavefunctions by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a symmetry index , @xmath16 is the lattice position of a unit cell , and @xmath51 is the position of the atom @xmath52 within a unit cell .",
    "it is desirable to define the bloch basis wavefunctions by @xmath53 , though the phase factor @xmath54 is quite innocuous for the definition of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath55 and for the subsequent calculation of the energy bands .",
    "the question , whether to keep the phase factor or not , is however important for the definition of the peirls current @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to verify that , with the above definition of the bloch basis , one gets the same form for the peierls current if one considers a lattice with one atom per unit cell ( for which case the definition of the peierls current is unambiguous ) , and compare it with the same lattice with its period doubled ( and therefore now with two identical atoms per unit cell ) .",
    "we will examine the behaviour of the exact current and the approximate one under infinitesimal unitary transformation @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is antihermitian ) of the wannier functions defined by @xmath59 | m \\nu \\ra $ ] of the exact current is given by ( ) _ nm^ ( ) _ nm^ + _ k , \\ { ( ) _ nk^ w_km^ - w_nk^ ( ) _ km ^ } .",
    "this is the usual transformation of matrix elements of operators that remain invariant under unitary transformation .",
    "in fact , the paramagnetic and the diamagnetic parts of the operator @xmath60 are separately invariant .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath48 is however different .",
    "the variation of @xmath61 is given by    ( _ p)_nm^ & & ( _ p)_nm^ + _ k , \\ { ( _ p)_nk^ w_km^ - w_nk^ ( _ p)_km^ } + ie _ k , ( _ m - _ k ) t_nk^ w_km^ - ie _ k , ( _ k - _ n ) w_nk^ t_km^ + & & + e^2 _ k , \\ { ( _ k - _ n ) ( ( _ m - _ k ) ) + ( _ m - _ k ) ( ( _",
    "m - _ n ) ) } t_nk^ w_km^ + & & - e^2 _ k , \\ { ( _ m - _ k ) ( ( _ k - _ n ) ) + ( _ k - _ n ) ( ( _",
    "m - _ n ) ) } w_nk^ t_km^.    the paramagnetic and the diamagnetic parts of @xmath48 are both basis dependent operators .",
    "the basis dependence of @xmath48 raises the practical question as to what basis one should choose while making the peierls construction .",
    "for example , there have been efforts to calculate polarization properties , like effective charges of semiconductors , using the empirical tight - binding theory .",
    "@xcite in this scheme a natural approximation is the `` diagonal '' ansatz which assumes that the position operator is diagonal in the tight - binding basis with expectation values equal to the atomic positions .",
    "this is equivalent to a peierls substitution , and the polarization calculated with this ansatz is related to peierls current @xmath48 .",
    "the effective charges calculated in this procedure depends on the choice of the underlying wannier basis . in order to improve the results one should first make an appropriate choice of a basis .",
    "one possibility is to use the basis of the `` maximally localized '' wannier functions that was introduced by marzari and vanderbilt .  @xcite this is obtained by minimizing a functional which measures the spread of the wannier functions .",
    "intuitively , it seems plausible that the approximation in which the connection coefficients are neglected , will work better in a basis where the wannier functions are more localized .",
    "a second possibility , suggested by millis ,  @xcite is to choose that basis in which the charge stiffness calculated using the peierls current will be closest to the one obtained from band theory .",
    "we note that this criteria is already satisfied by the bloch basis in which the effective one - electron hamiltonian is diagonal in the band indices .",
    "this can be seen easily in the following manner .",
    "we consider the scenario of band theory where electrons are in an effective periodic potential .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the single particle energy levels .",
    "it can be shown that the charge stiffness is given by @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite here @xmath64 is the fermi function and @xmath50 , @xmath65 denote spatial directions .",
    "the peierls current constructed in the bloch basis does not have any interband term since the basis is already diagonal in the band indices .",
    "the paramagnetic part of the current is given by @xmath66 .",
    "since the paramagnetic part has no interband matrix element , it does not contribute to the charge stiffness .",
    "the diamagnetic part , given by @xmath67 , gives a charge stiffness exactly equal to that obtained from band theory .",
    "it is possible , though , that there are other bases which satisfy this criteria .",
    "in passing we note that if the matrix elements of the exact current @xmath60 are known by some means , say , from first principles calculation , then it is possible to define the functional = _ nm n | - _ p    and thereby the difference between the exact current and the approximate one . using eqns .",
    "[ 7 ] and [ 8 ] we can calculate the variation of @xmath68 under infinitesimal unitary transformation .",
    "the gradient , defined as @xmath69 , is given by    g_nm^ & = & ( _",
    "m - _ n ) n | [ _ 0 , ( - _ p ) ] | m + ie ( ( _ m ) _ m - ( _ n ) _",

    ". in general , this criteria will give a basis which is different from that of the `` maximally localized '' wannier functions .",
    "the above method of choosing an appropriate basis is not very useful for doing charge transport calculations because to define the method one needs to know the matrix elements of the exact current , knowing which makes the peierls construction redundant .",
    "however , one can use this optimization procedure for doing thermal transport calculation . as we will see in the next section , the matrix elements of the exact thermal current are quite complicated , and a peierls formulation of the thermal current is desirable ( in some suitable basis ) .",
    "the rationale for our suggestion is that the basis which optimizes the peierls construction for electric transport will be a good basis for doing the peierls construction for thermal transport as well .",
    "in field theory the energy current ( which is same as the thermal current , except for the latter the single particle energies are measured from the chemical potential ) is determined from the invariance of the action under the transformation of time @xmath70 .",
    "this shifts the field operators by @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . from the variation of the action defined in equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "the energy current ( @xmath73 ) is given by    _",

    "here @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the two - particle interaction energy ( coulomb potential , in our case ) .",
    "the second term above , which is formally quartic in the field operators , is the contribution to energy current from the non - local ( in space ) interaction .",
    "this term was missed by langer ,  @xcite but noted in a different context by jonson and mahan .",
    "@xcite more recently , it has been discussed by moreno and coleman .",
    "@xcite    we have discussed in the previous section that for an effective low - energy model any current is obtained correctly by projecting the current for the full theory ( where both high and low energy degrees of freedom are present ) on the low - energy bands . to implement this for the energy current one has to consider variations of the wannier operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 under translation of time .",
    "if we ignore the terms with the connection coefficients , we get an approximate current which is equivalent to a peierls substitution . the same approximate current can be derived from the low - energy effective hamiltonian using the equations of motion .",
    "@xcite although we are emphasizing the importance of the exact low - energy current , in practice , calculating the exact thermal current is fairly complicated .",

    "in fig.1 , @xmath122 is the interaction term of the hubbard hamiltonian . in the limit of infinite @xmath95",
    "the latter drops out , and the factorization of the correlation function is possible . in imaginary time + & & _ , v_^2 \\ { t _ _ , ( ) c _ , ^(0 ) t _ c _ , ( 0 ) c _ , ^ ( ) + h.c . } . using @xmath123 ( in imaginary time ) , we get    @xmath124    we drop the second term within braces because it does not contribute to @xmath125 .",

    "the current ( charge or thermal ) obtained by peierls substitution or by the equation of motion technique is an approximation to the exact low energy current for an effective tight - binding hamiltonian . in particular ,",

    "we have suggested a simple criteria by which one can choose a set of wannier functions where the difference between the exact and the approximate current is minimum .",
    "the minimization procedure is well defined provided the matrix elements of the exact current are known from first principles calculation . using the equations of motion",
    "we have derived the thermal current for a very general tight - binding hamiltonian , correcting the result of a previous work . finally , using the peierls currents , we have established the correctness of known expressions for the transport coefficients for the hubbard model in infinite @xmath95 .",
    "the simplification in the limit of large coordination is that the current ( charge and thermal ) correlation functions can be factorized into products of single particle green s functions and their time derivatives .",
