    "the quantum mechanical representation theory proposed by dirac @xcite has made a profound effect on the development of modern quantum physics .",
    "the symbolic method combined with the technique of integration within an ordered product ( iwop ) of operators has been found to be a usefull method to find the new quantum mechanical representation @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "entangled state representations @xcite have played a more important role in quantum optics @xcite , quantum information and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "actually , quantum mechanical representation can construct a bridge between classical linear integral transform and quantum unitary operator @xcite .",
    "that is to say , different linear integral transforms can be described by different quantum operators , such as the generalized fresnel transform @xcite in 1-dimensional ( 1d ) can be described by the 1-mode fresnel operator @xmath0 @xcite and the 2-mode fresnel transform can be described by 2-mode fresnel operator @xmath1 @xcite in quantum optics .",
    "these quantum operators acting on quantum states can generate new quantum mechanical representations .",
    "for instance , fresnel operator @xmath0 acting on the coordinate eigenstate @xmath2 can generate the intermediate coordinate - momentum representation @xmath3 @xcite , and fresnel operator @xmath4 applying to the entangled state @xmath5 @xcite can generate the intermediate entangled state representation @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , beam splitter ( bs ) has played an important role in generating entangled states , such as a three - mode continuous - variables ( cv ) entangled state was proposed by using an asymmetric bs @xcite and a parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) instrument , and then a four - mode cv entangled state was generated by bs and pdcs @xcite .",
    "in addition , multi - mode cv entangled state was generated by a bs and a polarizer or by bs , pdc and a polarizer @xcite .",
    "it is no doubt that all these studies above exhibit the role of bs in generating entangled states and indicate that these physical instruments , such as pdc , bs and polarizer , can be used to implement entangled states .",
    "then an interesting question thus naturally arises : is there any kind of entangled state which can be generated by combining bs and fresnel transform optical process ?",
    "as far as our knowledge goes , there has no report in the literature up to now . in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a new entangled state representation which is called the intermediate coherent - entangled state ( ices ) representation .",
    "it is shown that it can be generated by the bs and the fresnel transform .",
    "the paper  is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the fresnel operator and the intermediate coordinate - momentum state ( icms ) representations which can be obtained by the fresnel operator @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we present two methods to produce ices , which is a new entangled state representation and is not been presented before . deriving the ices representation naturally from the completeness relations of the coherent state and the generalized coordinate state by iwop technique",
    "is one method . producing the ices by combining a symmetric bs and the fresnel transformation is another method . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the characters of the ices , including the eigenvalue equation , orthogonal relation , schmidt decomposition and conjugate state . as the applications of the new representation , in section 5",
    ", we derive a new squeezing operator and derive some operator identities .",
