    "<S> flavor changing neutral currents can be induced by scalar and vector fields . </S>",
    "<S> although these effects can be mediated by higgs and @xmath6 bosons at the level of classical action , those induced by the photon field constitute a net quantum effect , as they only can be generated at one  loop or higher orders . at the one  loop level , </S>",

    "<S> they can also be induced by lfv higgs couplings to leptons that naturally arise from extended yukawa sectors  @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in investigating the lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays in the context of extended yukawa sectors , which are always present within the sm with additional @xmath7higgs multiplets or in larger gauge groups . </S>",
    "<S> although this effect is absent in the sm , it is expected that more complicated higgs sectors tend to favor its presence . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that these lfv transitions of the tau lepton are mediated by a virtual scalar field with mass of the order of the fermi scale @xmath8 gev . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of focusing in a specific model , we will adopt a model  independent approach by using the effective lagrangian technique  @xcite , which is an appropriate scheme to study those processes that are suppressed or forbidden in the sm . in this brief report , we present a calculation for the @xmath0 and @xmath9 decays induced at the one  loop level by a lfv @xmath2 vertex generated by an effective yukawa sector that includes @xmath10 invariants of dimension higher than four . </S>",
