    "matter - wave solitons is a theme that has attracted much attention in studies of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and , more generally , in studies of superfluids @xcite  see , e.g. , recent reviews @xcite . in atomic becs ,",
    "matter - wave solitons have been realized by means of various methods , including phase - imprinting @xcite , density engineering @xcite , quantum - state engineering @xcite , transport in optical lattices @xcite , transport past single defects @xcite or through disordered potentials disord , and nonlinear interference between individual condensates collisions .",
    "furthermore , matter - wave solitons have also been observed in multi - component becs consisting of two different spin states of the same atom species . in particular , atomic dark - bright solitons",
    "have been realized in binary rubidium condensates by means of the quantum - state engineering technique @xcite , or the counterflow between two miscible components @xcite ; employing the latter technique , generation of dark - dark solitons was reported too @xcite .",
    "importantly , solitons have been argued to emerge spontaneously upon crossing the bec phase transition , via the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite .",
    "this can be thought of as a quasi - one - dimensional analog of the pioneering experiments on the same mechanism in higher - dimensional becs performed in  @xcite .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the counterflow of two miscible , quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) bec superfluids , is one of the techniques that were recently used for the generation of matter - wave solitons .",
    "more generally , the counterflow dynamics of superfluids is an interesting subject due to its links with such fundamental phenomena as turbulence , pattern formation , and generation of topological defects , which occur in a vast variety of physical contexts ranging from superfluid helium to cosmological strings and inflation @xcite . in the context of binary atomic becs ,",
    "a number of theoretical works have been dealing with the counterflow of either miscible @xcite or immiscible @xcite binary superfluids . in the former case ,",
    "quantum turbulence and vortex generation in higher - dimensional settings @xcite and in spinor becs with @xmath0 @xcite were studied ; in the latter case , effects of quantum swapping , rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite , and parametric resonance of capillary waves were predicted @xcite .",
    "furthermore , more recently , the counterflow superfluid of polaron pairs in bose - fermi mixtures in optical lattices was analyzed @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose and analyze a physically relevant setting based on the counterflow of two immiscible superfluids .",
    "this setting can be used for the generation of scalar or vector solitons ( of the dark - bright type ) in binary becs , and also for studies of their superfluid properties .",
    "we consider a quasi-1d binary bec mixture composed of two immiscible components ,  small \" and  large \" ones , with ratios of axial sizes and number of atoms in them @xmath1 .",
    "we then assume that the  small \" component moves with constant velocity @xmath2 through the  large \" one , by itself or being dragged by a moving trapping potential .",
    "systematic simulations of this setting produce the following phenomenology . for sufficiently small dragging velocities , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the speed of sound of the large component , and if the trap of the small component is switched off , the small component can not remain localized , hence no well - defined patterns are formed . for intermediate velocities , @xmath5 ,",
    "a robust two - component dark - bright soliton is formed .",
    "it is composed of a bright ( dark ) soliton in the small ( large ) component and can be very well approximated analytically .",
    "in particular , we use a multiscale asymptotic expansion method to reduce the underlying system of the gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) to a completely integrable melnikov system @xcite , thus very accurately mapping the dark - bright solitary wave , which spontaneously emerges in the gpe system , into an exact soliton of the melnikov system . on the other hand , for @xmath6 but in the presence of its trap dragging the small component ,",
    "melnikov s \" dark - bright soliton still emerges but is unstable and eventually decays . for larger trap velocities , @xmath7 , and if the trap is absent , a scalar dark soliton is created in the large component .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath8 and in the presence of the trap , the small component is deformed into a sharply localized object , with a width on the order of the healing length , which propagates with a velocity larger than the critical velocity for the breakdown of the superfluidity in the large component .",
    "the breakdown leads to the emergence of multiple dark solitons , similarly to the results reported in previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite works ( cf . also the quasi - two - dimensional analog of such an experiment producing vortex dipoles  @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the model is formulated in section ii .",
    "then , in section iii , we systematically analyze , by means of analytical approximations and direct simulations , two different scenarios of the evolution of the small component , in the absence or in the presence of its trap . finally , in section iv we summarize our findings and discuss possibilities for the extension of the analysis .",
    "we consider the binary bec composed of two hyperfine states of @xmath9rb , that are described by macroscopic wave functions @xmath10",
    "( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the dynamics can then be described by the following system of coupled gpes @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the atomic mass , @xmath14 are chemical potentials , @xmath15 are trapping potentials , and @xmath16 are coupling constants defined by the @xmath17-wave scattering lengths , @xmath18 . notice that , for states @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which were used in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , or states @xmath19 and @xmath21 used in refs .",
    "@xcite , all the scattering lengths take approximately equal ( positive ) values . below we assume @xmath22 ,",
    "hence the sign of parameter @xmath23 , which determines whether the two components are miscible ( @xmath24 ) or immiscible ( @xmath25 ) mineev , depends only on ratio @xmath26 : if @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , then the two superfluids are immiscible ( miscible ) .",
    "we consider the case when both components are confined in strongly anisotropic ( quasi-1d ) traps , which have the form of rectangular boxes of lengths @xmath29 , with the transverse - confinement lengths @xmath30 being on the order of the healing lengths @xmath31 .",
    "for such a highly anisotropic trap , it is relevant to factorize the wave functions into longitudinal and transverse components , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath34 where the transverse modal functions @xmath33 and energies @xmath35 are determined by the auxiliary 2d problem for the quantum oscillator in the transverse box .",
    "since the considered system is effectively one - dimensional , it is natural to assume that @xmath36 remains in the ground state , i.e. , @xmath37 , for @xmath11 . using these expressions , we substitute expressions  ( [ decomp1])-([decomp2 ] ) into eqs .",

    "we have checked that , as long as the ratios of the atom numbers , chemical potentials and trap lengths are such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the results are qualitatively similar .    in our simulations , we will approximate the box - like trapping potentials @xmath73 by super - gaussians : @xmath74 , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the ( common ) trap amplitude for both components , while @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the positions and widths of the traps , respectively .",

    ", our systematic simulations have revealed the existence of three different velocity regimes , characterized by the emergence ( or the failure to emerge ) of various localized nonlinear structures .",
    "these regimes were identified by calculating  at each time step  the maximum density dip in the @xmath90-component , as well as the peak density of the @xmath54-component , as shown in the top and bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , respectively .    in particular , for velocities @xmath94 [ corresponding to the region on the left of the first dashed ( green ) line in fig .",

    "additionally , a dip of a constant density is formed in the large ( @xmath90 ) component , which propagates with the same velocity as the peak in the the @xmath54-component , i.e. , the two components build a traveling coherent structure .",

    "notice that the strong emission of sound waves which is observed chiefly in the @xmath53-component is solely due to the penetration process ( as in the case of fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] , it is observed that , close to the right edge of the intermediate velocity regime , _",

    "after this transient region , in the regime of a large trap velocity , @xmath163 , the @xmath54-component does not stay localized and is quickly dispersed ; this can also be observed in fig .",
    "thus , in this case , the dark - bright soliton of the melnikov type is not formed .",
    "however , shortly after penetrating the @xmath53-component , the @xmath54-component creates a dark soliton there , which propagates robustly all over the spatial region occupied by the @xmath53-component , cf . fig .",

    "[ fig8 ] , respectively .",
    "similarly to the case without the trap , three different regimes can be identified . in particular , for low trap velocities @xmath165 , the dynamics of the two components is similar to that observed in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "again , in this case , long - lived localized structures are not formed in either component , and strong emission of radiation is observed .    for the trap velocity in the intermediate region of @xmath166",

    "[ fig9 ] , for @xmath168 . as is observed in the inset of the figure , after the @xmath54-component has intruded into the @xmath53-field , it splits into fragments , following its in - trap dynamics .",
    "the largest one among these fragments couples to a dark soliton in the @xmath53-component , and the resulting structure can be categorized as a melnikov soliton : for the parameters used in fig .",

    "this is in good agreement with the numerically found mean soliton s velocity , which is @xmath172 , a fact that indicates that this structure is indeed proximal to a melnikov soliton .",
    "however , in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the @xmath54-component travels with speed @xmath168 , while the soliton propagates with a larger velocity .",
    "therefore , the confined bright - soliton component inevitably collides with  and is reflected by  the trap boundaries .",
    "this results in complex motion of the dark - bright soliton , which can not be sustained for long times and eventually decays ( at @xmath173 ) .",
    "in fact , it is the trap itself in this case which is detrimental to the existence of the melnikov soliton .",
    "while the latter has its intrinsic velocity upon the formation , the trap bears its own distinct velocity , and , barring a non - generic scenario when these two velocities coincide , we can not expect the solitary wave to persist , due to the unavoidable collision with either the  front \" or the  back \" of the trap .",
    "this is the key distinguishing feature between the intermediate speed cases in the presence and absence of the trap .    , but in the case when the @xmath54-component is subject to the action of the trap . in this case too , three different regimes can be identified : a ) @xmath174 with no localized excitations , b ) @xmath166 , where unstable dark - bright solitons are observed , and c ) @xmath175 , in which case we observe the nucleation of multiple dark solitons in the @xmath53-component.,title=\"fig : \" ] , but in the case when the @xmath54-component is subject to the action of the trap . in this case too , three different regimes can be identified : a ) @xmath174 with no localized excitations , b ) @xmath166 , where unstable dark - bright solitons are observed , and c ) @xmath175 , in which case we observe the nucleation of multiple dark solitons in the @xmath53-component.,title=\"fig : \" ]    . in this case , a dark - bright soliton of the melnikov type is formed , but it decays due to the fact that the soliton s velocity is larger than the speed of the trap ( see text ) . ]",
    "when the trap s velocity exceeds the value @xmath176 , we observe a constant robust large dip , in the @xmath90-component , while the @xmath54-component features a peak , oscillating around a relatively large value . as we show below",
    ", this is a critical velocity above which multiple dark solitons are generated in the @xmath90-component , indicating breakdown of the superfluidity . as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , a persistent , almost zero - density region arises in the @xmath90-component . in this case",
    ", the nucleation of multiple dark solitons in the @xmath53-component occurs .",
    "a typical example is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( for @xmath177 ) : shortly after the @xmath54-component has intruded into the flat part of the @xmath53-component , dark solitons are repeatedly emitted .",
    "this behavior can be understood as the breakdown of the superfluidity in the @xmath53-component , caused by the supersonic motion of the @xmath54-component : in fact , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , at early stages of the evolution , the @xmath54-component actually becomes a sharply localized  obstacle \" , which moves with a velocity exceeding the critical one ( which is , roughly , the speed of sound @xmath86 of the @xmath53-component ) .",
    "accordingly , the dynamics follows the scenario revealed in previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite works concerning the breakdown of the superfluidity in quasi-1d becs . in all these works ,",
    "continuous emission of dark solitons was reported .",
    "the mechanism of the breakdown was elucidated in the pioneering work of  hakim @xcite . in particular , up to the critical point , the moving defect ( in our case , the effective one , represented by the @xmath96-component ) can sustain a pair of localized states co - traveling with it ( a saddle and a center ) . past the critical point ,",
    "a saddle - center bifurcation arises , and such states can no longer be sustained . to alleviate the local super - criticality ( in terms of the speed ) , the defect nucleates a ( sub - sonic ) dark solitary wave . yet , once the wave has traveled sufficiently far downstream , it no longer renders the vicinity of the defect sub - critical , and a new dark soliton is emitted .",
    "the repetition of this process leads to the emergence of a dark - soliton train .    .",
    "in this case , the superfluidity of the @xmath53-component breaks down , and multiple dark solitons are formed . ]    it is relevant to quantitatively justify the above arguments , upon estimating the critical velocity needed for the breakdown of the superfluidity .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "first , we observe , in the example depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] for @xmath178 , that the @xmath54-component has initially ( at @xmath52 ) the form of an extended wave packet ( shaped by trap acting on it ) ; however , after intruding into the @xmath53-field , it splits into fragments .",
    "the largest among these fragments has the peak density approximately four times as large as the initial one , and becomes sharply localized , with the half - width at half - maximum of the order of healing length @xmath179 ( which is equal to @xmath180 in our dimensionless notation ) .",
    "based on this observation , it is possible to consider the @xmath54-component as a delta - like obstacle of some effective strength @xmath181 . to calculate it",
    ", we fit the @xmath54-component by a normalized gaussian function with an equal amplitude at @xmath182 ( when the @xmath54-component attains its maximum peak density ) .",
    "then , we use the approximate expression for the critical velocity of ref .",
    "@xcite , which reads : @xmath183^{1/2}}{2\\upsilon _ { \\mathrm{cr}}^{2}-1+\\sqrt{1 + 4\\upsilon _ { \\mathrm{cr}}^{2}}}. \\label{hak}\\ ] ] in fig",
    ".  [ fig12 ] , we show the dependence of the critical velocity @xmath184 , calculated as explained above , on the trap s velocity @xmath2 . by applying a straight - line fit to the values of @xmath184 , we find that @xmath185 .",
    "thus , there is a very weak dependence of the effective strength of amplitude of the steep moving obstacle , represented by the @xmath54-component , on the initial trap s speed . by comparing this fit with the diagonal in the ( positive quarter- ) plane of @xmath184 vs. @xmath2",
    ", we can conclude what initial speeds of the trap turn out to be supercritical .",
    "in particular , it is clear from fig .",
    "fig12 that , for @xmath186 , the trap exceeds the critical velocity @xmath184 , hence the superfluidity is expected to break down .",
    "note that the numerically obtained velocity , beyond which the superfluidity breaks down indeed and dark solitons are emitted was found to be @xmath176 [ see the rightmost dashed ( green ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ] , which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical approximation based on eq .",
    "( [ hak ] ) .",
    "-component for the trap s velocity @xmath187 , in two instants : at @xmath52 ( the blue line ) and at @xmath188 ( the green line ) , when it attains the maximum peak density .",
    "the inset shows the density profile of the larger part of the @xmath54-component at @xmath188 ; its half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) equals to @xmath189 , being on the order of the healing length , @xmath190 . ]    , versus the trap s velocity , @xmath191 .",
    "first we calculate the value of @xmath192 [ depicted by ( blue ) circles ] for different trap s velocities , and then apply the straight - line fit [ the dashed ( green ) line ] .",
    "breakup of the superfluidity is expected when the trap s velocity becomes larger than the critical velocity , i.e. at @xmath193 , as indicated by the vertical dashed ( black ) line . ]    in summary , three regimes are also identified in the case when the @xmath54-component is subject to the action of the potential , although their dynamics is different from the case when the trap was absent , except for the low - speed case . in the intermediate - speed regime ,",
    "solitary waves of the melnikov type form but are unstable due to the velocity mismatch with the moving trap . in the large - speed regime ,",
    "the superfluidity was shown to break down at the critical point very close to the related analytical prediction , which leads , as in the case of  ref .",
    "@xcite , to the emission of a train of dark solitons , due to the effective potential exerted by the second ( @xmath54 ) component on the first ( @xmath53 ) one .",
    "in this work , we have studied the dynamics of two quasi-1d counter - propagating immiscible superfluids .",
    "our setup is based on the bec mixture composed by two different spin states of the same atomic species , with the number of atoms in one of the two components being much smaller than in the other . in our simulations of the coupled gpes ,",
    "we have assumed that the  large \" component is at rest while the  small \" component starts intruding into the larger one , moving at a constant velocity @xmath2 .",
    "we have considered two different situations , namely , with the small component propagating either in the absence or in the presence of the trap . for sufficiently small trap s velocities",
    "@xmath84 , we have found that no localized structures emerge .    on the other hand , for intermediate velocities in the interval of @xmath5 ,",
    "if the trap acting on the small component is switched off , we have found that a robust dark - bright soliton is formed .",
    "this structure is composed of a bright ( dark ) soliton in the small ( large ) component , and can be very well approximated analytically by means of the multiscale asymptotic expansion method , which reduces the original gpe  system to the completely integrable melnikov system .",
    "this system has exact soliton solutions that can be used to construct the approximate dark - bright soliton solutions of the gpe system .",
    "we have also found that , if the small component is subject to the action of the trapping potential , then the melnikov - type dark - bright soliton forms in a similar velocity regime , @xmath6 , but it can not be sustained due to the mismatch between its own velocity and the speed of the moving trap . if the small component propagates in the absence of the trap , then , for large initial trap velocities , @xmath7 , it disperses and no dark - bright soliton is formed ; nevertheless , a dark soliton is always created in the large component . on the other hand ,",
    "if the small component propagates in the presence of its trap , which moves with speed @xmath194 , we have found that it gets deformed into a sharply localized object of the width on the order of the healing length , which propagates with a velocity larger than the critical velocity of the large component .",
    "approximating the small component by an effective delta - like obstacle acting on the large component , we have found that , in the case of such large trap velocities , the dynamics of the system follows the scenario known for the quasi-1d superfluid flow past an obstacle . in this way , the superfluidity of the large component breaks down , and nucleation of a train of dark solitons occurs .",
    "our results suggest that such counterflow settings may be quite relevant to the observation of fundamental phenomena , such as the formation of solitons and/or the identifying the critical velocity in superfluid flows",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the considerations to higher - dimensional settings and , also , to larger number of components , as , e.g. , in the case of @xmath0 or @xmath195 spinor becs  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "vortex - bright solitary waves  @xcite and their dipole - more generalizations  @xcite are expected to arise , as well as their spinor counterparts .",
    "the generalizations with a larger number of components and in higher dimensions is likely to produce novel waveforms .",
    "another relevant extension concerns the role of @xmath196 ( the cross - component interaction strength ) and the approach to the miscibility - immiscibility threshold . in that context , exploring the conditions under which additional waveforms ( such as dark - dark solitons of  @xcite and their multi - dimensional counterparts ) can arise would also be a theme of interest .",
