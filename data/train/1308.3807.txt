    "a common bifurcation to instability , one that occurs in so - called natural hamiltonian systems that have hamiltonians composed of the sum of kinetic and potential energy terms , happens when under a parameter change the potential energy function changes from positive to negative curvature .",
    "in such a bifurcation , pairs of pure imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to real oscillation frequencies collide at zero and transition to pure imaginary , corresponding to growth and decay .",
    "this behavior , which can occur in general hamiltonian systems and is termed the steady state ( ss ) bifurcation , is depicted in the complex frequency @xmath0 plane in fig .",
    "alternatively , the hamiltonian hopf ( hh ) bifurcation is the generic bifurcation that occurs in hamiltonian systems when pairs of nonzero eigenvalues collide in the so - called kren collision @xcite between eigenmodes of positive and negative signature , as depicted in fig .  [ hbif]b .",
    "such bifurcations occur in a variety of mechanical systems @xcite ; however , hh bifurcations also occur in infinite - dimensional systems with discrete spectra .",
    "in fact , one of the earliest such bifurcations was identified in the field of plasma physics @xcite for streaming instabilities , where signature was associated with the sign of the dielectric energy , and this idea made its way into fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "streaming instabilities were interpreted in the noncanonical hamiltonian context in @xcite , where signature was related to the sign of the oscillation energy in the stable hamiltonian normal form @xcite ( see [ stabnf ] below ) .",
    "the purpose of this chapter and its companion @xcite is to describe hamiltonian bifurcations in the noncanonical hamiltonian formalism ( see @xcite ) , which is the natural form for a large class of matter models including those that describe fluids and plasmas .",
    "particular emphasis is on the continuum hamiltonian hopf ( chh ) bifurcation , which is terminology we introduce for particular bifurcations that arise in hamiltonian systems when there exists a continuous spectrum .",
    "there also exist a continuum steady state ( css ) bifurcation , but this will only be mentioned in passing .",
    "a difficulty presents itself when attempting to generalize kren s theorem , which states that a necessary condition for the bifurcation to instability is that the colliding eigenvalues of the hh bifurcation have opposite signature , to systems with continuous spectra .",
    "this difficult arises because ` eigenfunctions ' associated with the continuous spectrum are not normalizable , in the usual sense , and consequently obstacles have to be overcome to define signature for the continuous spectrum .",
    "this was done first in the context of the vlasov equation in @xcite and for fluid shear flow in @xcite . given this definition of signature , it become possible in @xcite to define the chh , a meaningful generalization of the hh bifurcation .    in the present chapter we motivate and explore aspects of the chh , which are picked up in our companion chapter @xcite .",

    "<S> hamiltonian bifurcations in the context of noncanonical hamiltonian matter models are described . </S>",
    "<S> first , a large class of 1 + 1 hamiltonian multi - fluid models is considered . </S>",
    "<S> these models have linear dynamics with discrete spectra , when linearized about homogeneous equilibria , and these spectra have counterparts to the steady state and hamiltonian hopf bifurcations when equilibrium parameters are varied . examples of fluid sound waves and plasma and gravitational streaming are treated in detail . </S>",
    "<S> next , using these 1 + 1 examples as a guide , a large class of 2 + 1 hamiltonian systems is introduced , and hamiltonian bifurcations with continuous spectra are examined . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how to attach a signature to such continuous spectra , which facilitates the description of the continuous hamiltonian hopf bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> this chapter lays the groundwork for kren - like theorems associated with the chh bifurcation that are more rigorously discussed in our companion chapter @xcite . </S>"
