    "the renewed interest in nuclear structure physics is due to its application to astrophysics .",
    "theories for the element synthesis in stars need both bulk properties of unstable isotopes like masses , and more specific information , such as level densities and neutrino - nucleus cross sections .",
    "eventually , the compression modulus and the symmetry energy of neutron - rich nuclei will be determined . for a recent review ,",
    "see e.g. ref .",

    "most calculations in this field are restricted to the mean field approximation which describes excited states by the one - particle one - hole random phase approximation ( 1p1h rpa ) . in this approximation one",
    "is able to describe two integral characteristics of giant resonances : the mean energy and the integrated strength .",
    "the width of the giant resonances is underestimated in mean field approaches , however , even if one includes the single particle continuum .",
    "in unstable nuclei , the analysis of , for example , the breathing mode and the giant electric dipole resonance requires realistic strength distributions because these resonances are expected to be broad and various multipole resonances overlap one another .",
    "theories beyond the mean field level are called for .",
    "the _ extended theory of finite fermi systems _ ( etffs ) is a linear response theory which incorporates phonons and pairing degrees of freedom .",
    "one essentially replaces the particle - hole propagator , which leads to the random phase approximation , by a more general propagator and changes , correspondingly , the renormalized interaction , the effective operators and the ground - state correlations .",
    "details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the authors worked out the coupling of phonons to the single particle propagators and to the interaction in a consistent way .",
    "the present calculations are based on the _ quasi particle time blocking approximation _ ( qtba ) that also considers pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "examples and references to previous calculations and microscopic analyses of experimental data can be found in @xcite .",
    "another model , the qrpa plus phonon coupling model , has been developed by bortignon and coworkers @xcite .",
    "most excited states predicted by the conventional random - phase approximation depend sensitively on the level density of the single - particle spectrum , as is well known from the schematic model by brown and bolsterli @xcite . as the tffs , with and without pairing , uses the experimental single particle spectrum as far as it is available , e.g. @xcite , it generally comes closer to the experimental data than self - consistent approaches do .",
    "for that reason an extended version of the tffs in which the effects of the phonons are included is the appropriate tool for systematic investigations of both collective and non collective states @xcite .",
    "its applicability , however , is limited by the need for experimental information on the level density in the neighboring odd mass nuclei .    at present , these properties of most short - lived neutron rich nuclei are not known experimentally .",
    "therefore one is forced to use nuclear mean fields extrapolated from the known stable nuclei .",
    "one of the most successful approaches starts with skyrme forces , a class of _ effective interactions _ defined at the _",
    "mean field level_. when going beyond the mean field level , one has to expect a renormalization of the interaction strengths @xcite .    in the present communication",
    ", we investigate quantitatively to which extent a renormalization of the skyrme parameterization may be required by employing a self - consistent mean field and the corresponding particle hole interaction derived from existing skyrme forces in the framework of the extended theory of finite fermi systems .",
    "there are various skyrme parameterizations that reproduce the ground state properties of the known isotopes with similar accuracy but result in different mean fields , as reviewed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the nuclear matter properties of the skyrme parameterizations , such as the effective mass , the compression modulus , and the symmetry energy can be used to group the effective interactions into some broad classes .",
    "the versions initiated by vautherin and brink were fitted to ground state properties only .",
    "those interactions are characterized by a large incompressibility ( see siii in table [ tab : t1 ] ) .",
    ".[tab : t1 ] nuclear matter properties of the skyrme parameterizations used in the present calculation ; for comparison also siii is given [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the present paper we report self - consistent nuclear structure calculations performed in the extended theory of finite fermi systems .",
    "skyrme parameterizations were used , which reproduce not only ground state properties of nuclei but also excited collective states within the rpa . in comparison with rpa calculations ,",
    "the widths of the giant resonances are brought into better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the centroid energies of the resonances are shifted , however .",
    "this finding implies the necessity of a renormalization of skyrme interactions for applications beyond the mean field level .",
    "our investigation suggests two major renormalizations : a reduction of the strength of the isoscalar particle - hole interaction and an increase of the isovector strength .",
