    "radiative seesaw models are well known as one of the economical and simultaneous explanations of tiny neutrino masses and dark matter ( dm ) due to having the strong correlations between them , and these issues are surely discussed beyond the standard model ( sm ) . even though a vast literature has recently arisen in refs .",
    "@xcite , there are few papers including inert isospin triplet scalar fields  @xcite . especially , @xmath1-hypercharge triplet scalars ( even ) with nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) provides the type - ii seesaw mechanism that naturally explains the tiny neutrino masses due to the smallness of vev , which is experimentally required .",
    "it also gives a lot of phenomenological aspects and/or constraints such as lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) processes through charged and/or neutral bosons , electroweak precision test , and the lowest bounds on their masses at large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study a one - loop induced radiative neutrino model with an inert isospin triplet boson ( instead of nonzero vev ) , in which we discuss neutrino oscillations , lepton flavor violations , anomalous magnetic moment , and a ( singlet - like ) bosonic dark matter candidate to explain the relic density and the direct detection .",
    "then we show the several results from the global numerical analysis . here",
    "we introduce the simplest discrete symmetry @xmath2 as an additional symmetry , which differentiates between sm fields and new fields and assures the stability of dm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show our model , including neutrino sector , lfvs , muon anomalous magnetic moment . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze bosonic dm candidate to explain relic density and direct detection . in sec .",
    "iv , we have a numerical analysis , and show some results .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the case of @xmath5 is specific , because we accidentally have some additional terms as follows : @xmath6 therefore the @xmath5 case can not realize the general model by itself any longer as discussed in the previous section , since the neutrino masses are induced through the above first term at the tree level . thus we impose an additional @xmath2 symmetry for new fields as shown in tab .  [ tab:1 ] . as a result , all the terms are originated from the general lagrangian , and the @xmath2 symmetry plays a role in assuring the stability of dm candidates @xmath7 or the neutral component of @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath7 is a real field for brevity , while @xmath8 has to be a complex field .",
