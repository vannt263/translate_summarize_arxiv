    "muirhead and waternaux ( 1980 ) modified john s test statistic to a wider elliptical distribution .    with the rapid development of technology , various types of high - dimensional data have been generated in many areas , such as hyperspectral imagery , internet portals , microarray analysis and dna .",

    "we observe that the bias term in ss is apparently exists , especially when @xmath43 is large .",
    "it is not strange because ss can only allow the dimension being comparable to the square of the sample size .",

    "the variance of ss test statistic will increase faster than sr and sk test statistics because of the estimation of location parameters .",
    "then it is not surprising that the power of ss is smaller than these two tests .",
