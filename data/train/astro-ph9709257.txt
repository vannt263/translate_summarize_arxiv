    "observations at all wavelengths from radio to gamma rays have shown the presence of a diffuse background emission that appears to emanate from beyond our galaxy .",
    "it is generally believed that these extragalactic photons have different origins , which may be broadly thought of as arising from truly diffuse processes or from the contributions of a large number of unresolved point sources .",
    "the x - ray background ( below 100 kev ) is generally understood to arise primarily from the integrated emission of unresolved active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( leiter and boldt 1992 ; comastri 1995 ; zdziarski 1995 ) such as seyfert galaxies with redshifts ranging up to 5 . in the low - energy gamma - ray regime ( 0.5 to 10 mev )",
    "the measurement of an extragalactic component is made difficult by the presence of significant instrumental background , nuclear line emission and emission from strong sources .",
    "recent results from the comptel instrument ( kappadath 1996 ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) and the solar maximum mission ( smm ) ( watanabe 1997 ) , indicate the presence of an extragalactic component , significantly lower than previous measurements . at higher energies ( @xmath030 mev )",
    ", the oso-3 satellite provided the first evidence for gamma - ray emission from our galaxy ( kraushaar 1972 ) .",
    "this was followed by observations by the sas-2 satellite ( fichtel 1975 ) , which provided clear evidence for a strong correlation of the observed diffuse emission with the expected gamma - ray emission from cosmic - ray , matter and photon interactions .",
    "in addition , the sas-2 results also indicated for the first time , the presence of a residual , apparently isotropic emission which was interpreted as not being associated with the galaxy and hence of extragalactic origin ( fichtel 1977 ; fichtel , simpson , and thompson 1978 ) . the sas-2 telescope had been carefully designed and tested to have a very low instrumental background ( derdeyn 1972 ) and launched into a near equatorial orbit to minimize the effects of trapped radiation .",
    "this was necessary to carry out observations of this diffuse radiation . in the final analysis of the sas-2 data ( thompson and fichtel 1982 )",
    ", the integral intensity above 100 mev was determined to be ( 1.3@xmath10.5)and the slope of the spectrum to be 2.35@xmath2 .",
    "detailed measurements of the isotropy were not possible , but the sas-2 results did show that the center - to - anticenter ratio for the radiation within 20@xmath340was 1.10@xmath10.19 and the ratio of the intensity perpendicular to the plane to that in the 20@xmath340 region was 0.87@xmath10.09 ( fichtel , simpson , and thompson , 1978 ) .",
    "thus , these early results did suggest that there was no evidence for significant large scale anisotropy in the extragalactic gamma - ray emission .    with more than an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over previous experiments ,",
    "a low instrumental background , and a low altitude orbit , egret ( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) has provided an opportunity to study the spectrum and distribution of the extragalactic emission in greater detail than was possible in the past .",
    "the compton gamma - ray observatory was launched on 1991 april .",
    "a prime objective of egret was to carry out the first all - sky survey in high - energy gamma rays ( 30 mev@xmath4 e @xmath4 30 gev ) .",
    "the most striking feature of the diffuse radiation is the dominant emission from the galaxy which , fortunately for the study of the extragalactic emission , is strongly concentrated along the galactic plane . the survey also shows the presence of many point - like sources , some of which have been identified with pulsars , molecular clouds , active galactic nuclei , and a nearby normal galaxy ( lmc ) .",
    "about 51 sources have been identified with a class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) called blazars ( thompson 1996 ; mattox 1997 ; mukherjee 1997 ) which are , in general , radio - bright agn with flat radio spectra , strong optical polarization , superluminal motion ( often ) and significant time variability at most wavelengths .",
    "egret observations have shown that for a majority of the gamma - ray luminous blazars , the gamma - ray emission dominates the bolometric luminosity ( von montigny 1995 ) , at least during outbursts .",
    "this paper discusses the findings on the diffuse high - energy gamma - ray emission at high latitudes ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the intense galactic plane emission is provided by hunter 1997 .",
    "we discuss the approach used to study the residual , presumably extragalactic high - energy gamma radiation by carefully accounting for the foreground galactic emission .",
    "the spectral and spatial distributions are determined .",
    "possible origins of the extragalactic emission are considered , including the question of whether it is truly diffuse or resulting from unresolved point source contributions .",
    "the egret instrument is sensitive to gamma rays in the energy range from about 30 mev to 100 gev .",
    "gamma rays are detected using a multilevel thin plate spark chamber system using the pair production process .",
    "an internal triggering telescope detects the presence of the electron - positron pair with the correct direction of motion and a large nai(tl ) crystal acts as energy - measuring calorimeter .",
    "an anticoincidence dome provides discrimination against the relatively intense charged - particle radiation in space .",
    "a detailed description of the instrument is given by kanbach ( 1988 ) and details on the instrument calibration and analysis procedures are available in thompson ( 1993 ) , fichtel ( 1993 ) , and esposito ( 1997 ) . in the wide field of view",
    "operational mode used for most of the observations discussed here , the effective area of the telescope is about 1000 @xmath7 at 100 mev and rises to 1500 @xmath7 around 0.5  1 gev , and decreases gradually at higher energies to about 700 @xmath7 at 10 gev near the center of the field - of - view .",
    "the effective area is a maximum when the target is on axis , falls to approximately 50% of this value when the angular offset reaches 18 , and has a useful sensitivity to at least 30 .",
    "the large field - of - view of egret is important for the study of the diffuse radiation being discussed here .",
    "egret observations from 1991 april to 1994 sept .",
    "( phases i , ii , and iii ) are used in the analysis reported here .",
    "these were obtained using the full field - of - view mode of the instrument and running the calorimeter in coincidence with spark chamber triggers .",
    "maps of counts , exposure , and intensity are generated in sky coordinates with 0.5@xmath80.5 bins for the individual observations .",
    "they are combined to create all - sky maps .",
    "only data from within 30of the pointing direction of the individual observations , within which the exposure and instrument characteristics are best understood , are used in creating the added maps . the combined exposure map ( see figure 2 . in thompson 1996 ) indicates non - uniform sky coverage which needs to be taken into account during the analysis .",
    "determining the extragalactic diffuse radiation is one of the more difficult measurements , because of the very low intensity of the expected emission and the lack of a spatial or temporal signature to separate the cosmic signal from other radiation . as will be shown , the spectrum , is significantly different from the galactic diffuse radiation . in order to study the extragalactic emission",
    ", one must subtract from the observation any instrumental background , the galactic diffuse emission , and the contribution from resolved point sources .",
    "it is essential to demonstrate that the instrumental background is kept well below the level of diffuse emission under study .",
    "hence three separate factors must be considered in the design and implementation of any space - borne high - energy gamma - ray detector used to study the extragalactic diffuse emission : a low cosmic - ray intensity environment for the spacecraft , the detailed instrument design , and its placement on the spacecraft .",
    "only the sas-2 and egret instruments had a background well below the intensity of the now measured diffuse extragalactic emission .",
    "the compton gamma - ray observatory was placed into a standard 28@xmath6 inclination orbit using a shuttle launch . for the first 6 years after launch",
    ", the compton observatory was kept below @xmath9 400450 kilometer altitude to minimize the effects of the trapped radiation .",
    "important features of the instrument design include the directional trigger system , the highly efficient ( 1 part in 10@xmath10 ) anticoincidence dome , and the amount and placement of the material above the anticoincidence dome .",
    "the typical cosmic - ray flux in orbit that egret sees , is about 10@xmath11 times the average gamma - ray flux .",
    "the high efficiency for rejection of cosmic - ray events by the anticoincidence dome ensures that nearly all cosmic - ray induced events are removed .",
    "however , cosmic rays impinging on material above the anticoincidence dome could produce , neutral pions via inelastic collisions which decay into gamma rays .",
    "clearly , the material must be kept to a minimum consistent with thermal and light penetration , but it must also be kept very close to the anticoincidence scintillator to maximize the probability that a secondary in any of the very improbable interactions will penetrate and trigger the anticoincidence dome .",
    "a new problem arose in the design of egret late in its development when , during the repair of the solar maximum mission satellite , it was discovered that the space debris had become much more intense than previous estimates .",
    "a penetration of the light shield surrounding the anticoincidence dome would cause a small light leak , seriously degrading its performance significantly . through a special design of the covering material the total amount of matter on the outside of the dome was held on an average to only 20@xmath12 more than that of sas-2 ( @xmath9 0.19 g@xmath13 compared to @xmath9 0.16 g@xmath13 ) . in addition , this material was kept close to the anticoincidence dome in order to have the highest probability for a secondary charged - particle to enter and trigger the anticoincidence system .",
    "extensive preflight calibration was carried out at the brookhaven laboratory to examine the background contribution from the material above the anticoincidence dome .",
    "these tests demonstrated that the instrumental background was more than an order of magnitude less than the intensity of the extragalactic diffuse radiation derived from the sas-2 data ( thompson 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , a steeper spectrum is expected for the cosmic - ray induced instrumental background .",
    "a potential source of contamination is from earth albedo gamma rays .",
    "these gamma rays arise from cosmic - ray interactions in the earth s upper atmosphere and are indistinguishable from cosmic gamma rays in the spark chamber .",
    "egret triggering is disabled during the earth occultation part of the orbit .",
    "as described in thompson ( 1993 ) , egret carries two 4 by 4 arrays of scintillator tiles which allow a set of 96 possible sub - telescope combinations .",
    "as the earth enters the field of view of any of the direction modes , triggering is disabled for that mode and thus events with an arrival direction defined by that direction mode , are not accepted .",
    "however , the albedo gamma - ray flux is quite large and peaks towards the horizon where it is about 10 times more intense than towards the nadir ( thompson , simpson , and zel , 1981 ) , resulting in the inclusion of a large number of earth albedo events in the primary data .",
    "the elimination of these earth albedo events is carried out as follows .",
    "an energy dependent cutoff in zenith angle ( @xmath14 ) is defined where the zenith angle ( @xmath15 is defined as the angle made by the incoming gamma ray with the direction of the earth center to spacecraft vector .",
    "events with zenith angles larger than @xmath14 are rejected , where    @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the calibrated instrument point spread function ( thompson 1993 ) . in order to sufficiently eliminate the inclusion of albedo events , a @xmath18 value of 4.0 is used for the analysis of the extragalactic emission , which is more restrictive than the value 2.5 used for the standard egret analysis of point sources .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is further restricted to a minimum value of 80at low energies to minimize excessive loss of good events and not to exceed a maximum of 105at high energies .",
    "use of the new values of @xmath14 also removed some albedo events that appeared to show non - uniform spatial clustering in the summed data ( willis 1996 ) .",
    "since there is only a negligible loss of good events as a result of this tighter restriction in zenith angle , no corrections are applied to the data .",
    "a final check of the contamination of the in - flight data from the charged - particle background is carried out by studying the rigidity dependence of the accepted events .",
    "the cut - off rigidity for charged cosmic rays , which varies throughout the orbit , defines the minimum momentum per unit charge necessary to avoid being excluded by the earth s magnetic field .",
    "so regions along the orbit characterized by high - magnetic field strengths have a smaller cosmic ray flux .",
    "figure 1 shows a rigidity plot of the histogram of event rates after imposing all selection criteria , for a range of observations . a ks - test using rigidity intervals of @xmath190.1",
    "gv yielded negligible probability for the distribution of event rate to be correlated with rigidity , implying there is no significant charged - particle contribution to the extragalactic emission being discussed here .",
    "there is indeed the possibility of high - rigidity ( @xmath020gv ) cosmic ray particles contributing to the background since they are not modulated by the earth s magnetic field .",
    "however , these charged particles have a high probability of producing additional charged particles along with the gamma rays during the interaction with the material ahead of the anticoincidence dome and thus enable the anticoincidence system to reject the event .",
    "the galaxy is a strong source of high - energy gamma rays arising primarily from the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar matter and to a lesser extent , interstellar photons .",
    "this emission is strongest within @xmath160 in galactic longitude and @xmath110 in galactic latitude , where most of the interstellar gas is present .",
    "it falls off rapidly at higher latitudes .",
    "the primary processes that produce the observed galactic diffuse gamma rays are : cosmic - ray nucleons interacting with nucleons in the interstellar gas , bremsstrahlung by cosmic - ray electron , and inverse compton interaction of cosmic - ray electrons with ambient low - energy interstellar photons ( bertsch 1993 ; hunter 1997 ) .",
    "the possible contribution from unresolved point sources such as pulsars , is uncertain with estimates ranging from a few percent to almost 100@xmath12 depending on the birth properties of pulsars ( bailes and kniffen 1992 ) .",
    "the evidence for a pion `` bump '' in the galactic diffuse spectrum ( hunter 1997 ) implies the unresolved source contribution is well below 50@xmath12 ; however a contribution @xmath4 20@xmath12 can not be ruled out at present .",
    "no effort is made to incorporate an unresolved source component in the galactic diffuse calculations used in this study .",
    "the electron bremsstrahlung and neutral pion decay processes dominate the diffuse emission , although at higher latitudes the inverse compton process could contribute up to 30% of the total observed galactic radiation , particularly in the inner galaxy . the calculations use deconvolved matter density distribution along with some assumptions about the corresponding cosmic - ray density distribution .",
    "bertsch ( 1993 ) and hunter ( 1997 ) discuss the detailed calculation of the diffuse emission from the galactic plane , including the approach used to derive the galactic cosmic ray density distribution . at latitudes",
    "@xmath5 10@xmath6 , the calculation of the galactic diffuse emission is more straightforward , since the gas distribution along the line - of - sight is mostly local ( within a few hundred parsec ) and the corresponding cosmic - ray spectrum at energies important for gamma - ray production is not expected to be very different from that which is measured locally at earth , corrected for solar modulation .",
    "the primary inputs necessary to calculate the expected level of diffuse gamma - ray emission in our galaxy include the distribution of interstellar hydrogen gas ( neutral and ionized ) , low - energy photon distribution ( 3k , ir , visible , uv ) , and the cosmic - ray density , spectrum and composition in the galaxy along every line - of - sight .",
    "as stated before , the high - latitude ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 ) calculation assumes , the spectrum of cosmic rays ( electrons and protons ) is the same as that measured locally , corrected for solar modulation .",
    "the neutral atomic hydrogen distribution is derived from the 21-cm map of dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) while the molecular hydrogen distribution is derived indirectly using the strength of @xmath20c@xmath21o emission at 2.6 mm provided by dame ( 1987 ) ( converted into h@xmath22 column density including a normalization factor of 1.5 @xmath23@xmath13(k km s@xmath24)@xmath24(hunter 1997 ) ) .",
    "recent enhancements to the dame work by digel ( 1996 ) are included .",
    "the ionized interstellar medium is not as well determined .",
    "the model of taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) based on radio pulsar studies is used here . at intermediate latitudes ( 10@xmath2530 ) ,",
    "most of the galactic emission arises from cosmic ray interactions with neutral material , while at higher latitudes ( @xmath030 ) the contributions from the ionized medium and the inverse compton component become important due to the larger scale heights of the ionized gas and the low - energy photons .",
    "since the spatial distribution of the low - energy photon density ( nir , fir , optical and uv ) in the galaxy is uncertain , the inverse compton calculation is not well determined .",
    "furthermore , the true cosmic - ray electron scale height is not known .",
    "the deconvolution of the observed galactic radio synchrotron data provides only a lower limit to the cosmic - ray electron scale height of 1 kpc ( broadbent , haslam and osborne 1989 ) since the galactic magnetic field distribution is not well understood .",
    "consequently , the current results on the extragalactic background emission are subject to these uncertainties , but recall that this is not the dominant component . hunter ( 1997 )",
    "have shown that there is good agreement between the observed high - energy gamma - ray diffuse radiation in the galactic plane and the calculations .",
    "in the next section , the calculations are compared with observations at all latitudes .",
    "the method for treating uncertainties in deriving the extragalactic emission is also discussed .",
    "the contribution from the 157 sources from the 2nd egret source catalog and its supplement ( thompson 1995 , 1996 ) , observed in excess of the diffuse background was modeled and subtracted from the data .",
    "a new set of binned maps ( 0.5@xmath8 0.5pixels ) of event counts and instrument exposure containing only contributions from unresolved sources , galactic diffuse & extragalactic diffuse radiation , were used for the analysis that follows . since the determination of the residual , presumably extragalactic radiation , depends critically on the degree to which the calculated galactic component matches the true galactic diffuse emission , it is important to demonstrate here the consistency of the predictions with the observations at all latitudes .",
    "figure 2 shows calculated and observed emission profiles in galactic latitude averaged over 60bands of galactic longitude .",
    "these results indicate the high - latitude calculations are in good agreement in general with the observed diffuse emission . however , in the inner galaxy near the galactic center ( @xmath26 ) the calculated intensities fall below the observed values .",
    "this could arise from interstellar material that is not included in the model or additional contributions from inverse compton processes arising from unmodeled soft photon distributions or unresolved sources .",
    "in addition , the local cosmic - ray density distribution could be non - uniform .    in order to derive the extragalactic emission without being very sensitive to the galactic model used ,",
    "the following approach is adopted .",
    "as described in section 1 , the observed emission at high latitudes is assumed to be made up of a galactic and an extragalactic component .",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 is the total diffuse intensity of high - energy gamma radiation as a function of galactic coordinates , and the gamma - ray energy e , and @xmath29 intensity of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the slope , `` b '' of a straight line fit to a plot of observed emission versus the galactic model gives an independent measure for the normalization of the model while the intercept,``a '' , equals the extragalactic emission .",
    "figure 3 shows the correlation plot for the 10 standard egret energy intervals , and table 1 summarizes the results .",
    "the points represent the average intensity within areas of equal solid angle ( @xmath9 0.1 steradian ) covering the whole sky except for an exclusion zone about the galactic plane ( @xmath30 ) and the region around the galactic center ( latexmath:[$|l|\\le 40\\deg \\ , \\ & \\ , 10\\deg\\le     taking into consideration the limited counting statistics at high and low energies and the distribution of the non - uniform sky coverage .",
    "the correlation is not as good at the lowest energy interval of 30  50 mev and at the highest energy interval ( 410 gev ) , primarily due to limited counting statistics . at intermediate energies ,",
    "the strong correlation provides tight constraints on the normalization of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the rather significant deviations in the normalization parameter from unity , for energies @xmath0 1 gev , reflects the spectral discrepancy between the galactic diffuse model and observations and is discussed in detail by hunter ( 1997 ) .",
    "this approach yielded the extragalactic gamma - ray spectrum up to 10 gev . beyond 10 gev",
    "larger uncertainties exist with the egret sensitivity calculation due to the self - veto arising from back - splash in the nai calorimeter ( thompson 1993 ) .",
    "hence , the results of a monte carlo simulation ( lin 1992 ) are used to determine the differential flux in the 1030 , 3050 , and 50120 gev energy ranges .",
    "consequently , these spectral points have additional associated systematic uncertainties . in this analysis , a systematic error of 13@xmath12 ( see esposito 1997 ) is assumed for 3010000 mev and 30@xmath12 beyond 10 gev .",
    "this also takes into account errors in correction factors used to model the changing spark chamber performance with time and photon energy .    in order to examine the isotropy of this emission",
    ", the sky was divided into 36 independent regions which excluded the region @xmath30 at all longitudes as well as @xmath32 about the galactic center .",
    "the latitude regions near the galactic center are excluded due to difficulties in accounting for all the galactic diffuse emission , while the galactic plane is excluded due to the extreme dominance of the observed emission by the galactic component .",
    "finally , in deriving the spectrum of the extragalactic emission in each of these regions , it was assumed that the energy - dependent normalization factors for the galactic calculation ( table 1 ) , derived from the all - sky analysis , remains unchanged for the 36 independent regions of the sky .",
    "it would be more appropriate to determine the normalization factors separately in each of the individual regions on the sky ; however , statistical limitations give large uncertainties in the results of the correlation analysis .",
    "using the approach described in section 4 , the resulting differential photon spectrum of the extragalactic emission averaged over the sky is well fit by a power law with an index of (2.10@xmath10.03 ) .",
    "the spectrum was determined using data from 30 mev to 10 gev ; however as shown in figure 4 , the differential photon flux in the 10 to 20 gev , 20 to 50 gev , and 50 to 120 gev energy intervals are also consistent with extrapolation of the single power law spectrum .",
    "the integrated flux from 30 to 100 mev is ( 4.26@xmath10.14)and that above 100 mev is ( 1.45@xmath10.05)were determined from the intercept of the straight line fit to the total observed emission and the galactic model .",
    "this agrees with previously reported sas-2 results ( thompson and fichtel 1982 ) , however the spectrum is slightly harder .",
    "egret observations also permit an examination of the degree of isotropy of the extragalactic emission .",
    "the derived integral fluxes in the 36 independent regions of the sky are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the flux values range from a low of ( 0.89@xmath10.17)to a high of ( 2.28@xmath10.34 ) .",
    "figure 6a shows a histogram of integral flux values , overlayed by a gaussian fit assuming equal measurement errors .",
    "the gaussian fit yields a mean flux above 100 mev of 1.47with a 1@xmath18 value of 0.33consistent with the all - sky calculation . of the 36 measurements , 69@xmath12 fall within 1@xmath18 of the mean , 97@xmath12 fall within 2@xmath18 , with only the largest value falling outside the 95@xmath12 confidence interval ( figure 6a ) . to further examine the spatial distribution , figure 6b and",
    "6c shows the same data plotted against galactic longitude and latitude respectively .",
    "no significant deviation from uniformity is observed in the latitude distribution ; however as a function of longitude , there appears to be an enhancement in the derived intensities towards @xmath9l=20 , but a closer examination shows this feature to be due to a few regions on the boundary of the excluded galactic center region .",
    "this could arise from unaccounted galactic diffuse emission . if one excludes the inner regions of the galaxy ( @xmath33r@xmath33 @xmath1960 ; r = angle made with the direction of the galactic center ) , the mean flux is 1.36above 100 mev .",
    "the distribution of the 28 independent observations is consistent with isotropy ( reduced @xmath34 = 1.09 ) . as discussed below",
    ", the inclusion of additional galactic emission in the inner galaxy measurements is not inconsistent with the observed distribution of spectral indices .",
    "however , the exact nature of the ` excess ' emission in the inner galaxy is not resolved by this analysis .",
    "figure 7 shows the distribution of spectral index in 36 independent regions of the sky .",
    "the power law indices vary from (2.04@xmath10.08 ) to (2.20@xmath10.07 ) and show no systematic deviations from the value of (2.10@xmath10.03 ) , derived from the all - sky analysis .",
    "the histogram of spectral indices shown in figure 8a yields a mean value of 2.11 with a 1@xmath18 value of 0.04 .",
    "the corresponding longitude and latitude distributions ( figure 8b , 8c ) show no indication of a smooth variation in the index .",
    "the expected distribution of the spectral indices can be calculated if one assumes that the outer galaxy average represents a better measure of the isotropic extragalactic emission and that the ` excess ' emission near the galactic center region arises solely from unaccounted galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the expected distribution should be characterized by an average of 2.12 with a standard deviation of 0.04 .",
    "this is consistent with the average value of (2.11@xmath10.04 ) derived from the all - sky distribution shown in figure 7 .",
    "finally , a distribution of the integral flux above 100 mev versus the corresponding spectral index is shown in figure 9 . even though the galactic diffuse emission spectrum is not well characterized by a single power law ( hunter 1997 ) , such a characterization in the 3010000 mev energy range would in general yield a harder spectral index(@xmath91.81.9 ) than that of the derived extragalactic emission .",
    "hence , any significant galactic contribution to the derived extragalactic emission would show evidence for some correlation between the integral flux and the spectrum . with the exception of a few points with the highest intensity",
    ", there is no correlation between the intensity and the spectral index . as stated before",
    ", these high points by themselves only suggest the presence of a small residual galactic component in some of the inner galaxy measurements .",
    "the results just presented have confirmed the existence of a generally uniform , presumably extragalactic diffuse radiation , consistent in intensity with that determined by the sas-2 experiment .",
    "they are generally consistent with the preliminary results from kniffen ( 1996 ) , osborne , wolfendale and zhang ( 1994 ) , and chen , dwyer , and kaaret ( 1996 ) which were all based on a smaller set of observational data .",
    "the presence of significant ` excess ' emission from ( l@xmath990,b@xmath952 ) to ( l@xmath945,b@xmath977 ) reported by chen , dwyer , and kaaret ( 1996 ) , is not as evident in our analysis possibly due to the more stringent zenith angle selection .",
    "osborne , wolfendale and zhang obtained a smaller integral flux , probably resulting from attributing a larger contribution from the inverse compton process to the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "the results presented here using a larger dataset and a much more careful accounting of other contributing effects , have greatly extended the energy spectral information , both in precision and energy range , as well as provided substantial additional information on its uniformity .",
    "combined with the x - ray and low - energy gamma - ray information a spectrum for the uniform diffuse radiation now exists over a broad energy range ( figure 10 ) .    a large number of possible origins for the extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray emission",
    "have been proposed over the years .",
    "fichtel and trombka ( 1981 ) have reviewed some of the proposed models .",
    "theories of diffuse origin include scenarios of baryon symmetric universe ( stecker , morgan , and bredekamp , 1971 ) , primordial black hole evaporation ( page and hawking , 1976 ; hawking , 1977 ) , million solar - mass black holes which collapsed at high redshift ( z@xmath9100 ) ( gnedin and ostriker 1992 ) , and some exotic source proposals , such as annihilation of supersymmetric particles ( silk and srednicki 1984 , rudaz and stecker 1991 , kamionkowski , 1995 ) .",
    "all of these theories predict continuum or line contributions that are unobservable above 30 mev with current instruments .",
    "models based on discrete source contributions have considered a variety of source classes .",
    "normal galaxies might at first appear to be a reasonable possibility for the origin of the diffuse radiation since they are known to emit gamma rays and to do so to very high gamma - ray energies ( sreekumar 1992 ; hunter 1997 ) .",
    "previous estimates ( kraushaar 1972 ; strong 1976 ; lichti , bignami , and paul , 1978 ; fichtel , simpson , and thompson , 1978 ) have shown that the intensity above 100 mev expected from normal galaxies is only about 3@xmath12 to 10@xmath12 of what is observed .",
    "further and perhaps even more significant , the energy spectrum of the galactic diffuse gamma rays is significantly different from that measured by egret for the extragalactic diffuse radiation , being harder at low energies ( 100 to 1000 mev ) and considerably steeper in the 1 to 50 gev region .",
    "dar and shaviv ( 1995 ) have suggested that emission arises from cosmic ray interaction with intergalactic gas in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "although the authors claim that this proposed explanation leads to a higher intensity level , it is still in marked disagreement with the measured energy spectrum ( stecker and salamon 1996a ) .",
    "clearly , small contributions from a number of these proposed sources remains viable . a fluctuation analysis ( willis 1996 ) indicates that @xmath910@xmath12 to 100@xmath12 of the emission could be made up of unresolved point sources and does not very well constrain the likely contribution from a diffuse origin .",
    "it has been postulated for over two decades by a large number of authors that active galaxies might be the source of this general high - energy gamma - ray diffuse emission ( e.g. bignami 1979 ; kazanas and protheroe 1983 ) .",
    "however , prior to the results from egret , only one quasar had been seen in high - energy gamma rays ( 3c273 ) ; so there was little data upon which to base a calculation of the expected intensity .",
    "now , a large number of high - energy gamma - ray - emitting blazars have been observed by egret ( von montigny 1995 ; mukherjee 1997 ) .",
    "one of the more important pieces of evidence in favor of the blazar origin of the high- energy portion of the diffuse spectrum is the spectrum .",
    "both the spectrum reported here and the average spectrum of blazars may be well represented by a power law in photon energy .",
    "the spectral index determined here for the diffuse radiation is (2.10@xmath10.03 ) , and the average spectral index of the observed blazars is (2.15@xmath10.04 ) .",
    "these two numbers are clearly in good agreement . a standard cosmological integration of a power law in energy yields the same functional form and slope .",
    "considering the new , well determined gamma - ray spectrum , this argues strongly that the bulk of the observed extragalactic gamma - ray emission can be explained as orginating from unresolved blazars .    in order to estimate the intensity of the diffuse radiation from blazars , knowledge of the evolution function",
    "is needed , as well as the intensity distribution of the blazars .",
    "two approaches have been utilized to determine the gamma - ray evolution .",
    "one way is to assume that the evolution is similar to that at other wavelengths .",
    "the other alternative is to deduce the evolution from the gamma - ray data itself and hence have a solution that depends only on the gamma - ray results .",
    "the advantage of the former is that , if the assumption of a common evolution is correct , an estimate with less uncertainty is obtained .",
    "the positive aspect of the latter is that there is no assumption of this kind , but the uncertainty in the calculated results is relatively large because of the small gamma - ray blazar sample .    several authors have estimated the contribution from blazars using the first approach described above ( padovani , 1993 ; stecker , salamon and malkan , 1993 ; setti and woltjer , 1994 ; erlykin and wolfendale , 1995 ; stecker and salamon 1996b ) where one accepts the proposition that the evolution function determined from the radio data may be applied to the gamma - ray - emitting blazars .",
    "the recent work of mukherjee ( 1997 ) shows that there is agreement within uncertainties between the radio and high - energy gamma - ray z distributions of both types of blazars , i.e. flat - spectrum radio quasars and bl lacs .",
    "the calculations agree with the observation of the intensity of the diffuse radiation , with the uncertainty varying with the approach and estimated errors . in most cases ,",
    "the calculations are within 50@xmath12 of the observed spectrum .",
    "a word of caution seems appropriate , since it should be pointed out that the degree and nature of the correlation between the radio and gamma - ray emission is still being debated ( padovani 1993 ; mcke 1996 ; mattox 1997 ) .",
    "the calculations of stecker and salamon ( 1996b ) predict a curvature in the blazar background spectrum ; our data while being well represented by a single power law , do not rule out such a curvature at least up to few gev .",
    "chiang et al . ( 1995 ) used only the gamma - ray blazar data to deduce the evolution function for the gamma - ray - emitting blazars .",
    "they used the v / vmax approach in the context of pure luminosity evolution ( currently the preferred concept ) to show that there was indeed evolution of the high - energy gamma - ray emitting blazars and to deduce the parameters describing the evolution .",
    "these authors found that the evolution was consistent within errors to that seen at other wavelengths .",
    "their estimated intensity level ranges from ( 1.9@xmath35 to 2.6@xmath36)@xmath810@xmath37 photons @xmath13 s@xmath24 sr@xmath24 for e@xmath0100 mev indicate large uncertainties due to the unconstrained nature of the lower end of the luminosity function .    with regard to the isotropy ,",
    "as described earlier , the data in the region @xmath960away from the galactic center , show no detectable deviation from isotropy within the limits of the egret measurements .",
    "the slight enhancement in the derived extragalactic intensity towards the galactic center is believed to arise mostly from additional galactic inverse compton contribution that has not been modeled due to large intrinsic uncertainties in the soft photon distribution .",
    "no evidence for any smooth angular variation is present in the power law spectrum used to characterize the extragalactic emission .    in examining the extragalactic diffuse spectrum from the x - ray to gamma - ray spectral region ,",
    "it has been suggested ( zdziarski 1996 ) that the combination of seyfert i and seyfert ii and a likely contribution from supernovae ( the 1993 ) , appears sufficient to explain the observed radiation from 1 kev to a few mev .",
    "although at this point in time , both the observational and theoretical picture of the extragalactic gamma - ray emission below 10 mev is unclear , it appears that at higher energies , egret observations discussed in this paper strongly suggest that the predominant origin of the gamma radiation in the region from 30 mev to at least 50 gev is blazar emission .",
    "other explanations for this high - energy gamma - ray region seem to be inconsistent with at least one aspect of the observations , with the well measured high - energy gamma - ray spectrum being a particularly strong discriminator .",
    "if the hypothesis that the general diffuse radiation is the sum of the emission of blazars is accepted , there is an interesting corollary .",
    "the spectrum of the measured extragalactic emission implies the average quiescent energy spectra of blazars extend to at least 50 gev and maybe up to 100 gev without a significant change in slope .",
    "most of the measured spectra of individual blazars only extend to several gev and none extend above 10 gev , simply because the intensity is too weak to have a significant number of photons to measure .",
    "intergalactic absorption does not have much effect at this energy except for blazars at relatively large z , and , in any case would have a depressing effect on the spectrum .",
    "hence , the continuation of the single power law diffuse spectrum up to 100 gev really implies that the source spectrum also continues without a major change in spectral slope to at least 100 gev .",
    "this conclusion , in turn , implies that the spectrum of the parent relativistic particles in blazars that produce the gamma rays remains hard to even higher energies .",
    "the authors wish thank andrzej zdziarski for providing the results of the various model calculations in machine readable form and betty rots for valuable editorial comments .",
