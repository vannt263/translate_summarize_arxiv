    "compelling evidence for cosmic acceleration comes from distance measurements to type ia supernovae . yet even with unlimited observational resources to improve statistical uncertainty , snia cosmology ultimately faces systematic uncertainties stemming from an incomplete physical model of the phenomena . indeed , since the physical conditions which give rise to the progenitors of the events are extremely difficult to discern , with no real consensus having been reached thus far , determining the nature of the evolution of sneia at high redshift remains a crucial challenge for precise and accurate measurements of the fundamental cosmological parameters . while several mechanisms have been devised to measure , test , and constrain snia systematics ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the possibility of source redshift evolution warrants a continued exploration of additional , complementary cosmographic methods .",
    "a simple observation provides a compelling foundation for the use of type ii - plateau supernovae ( ) as standardizable candles : the progenitors of several  have now been uncovered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and all are found to be red supergiants with somewhat similar initial stellar masses ( typically 816  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "consequently , the environments and pre - sn evolution of such objects are reasonably tractable .",
    "having undergone core collapse and envelope ejection , these red supergiants become sne observationally defined by the presence of hydrogen in the spectra and a `` plateau '' phase in their light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "sneii - p have been detected to redshift @xmath2 , and any evolutionary trends are likely to differ from those of sneia .",
    "as in the case of sneia , the intrinsic inhomogeneity in  peak luminosity , and that produced by extrinsic factors such as dust , can be calibrated .",
    "there are two different approaches to determining distance : the theory - based method , and the empirical standardized - candle method .",
    "the theoretical approach branches into two : ( 1 ) the expanding photosphere method ( epm ; @xcite ) , a historical descendent of the baade - wesselink method for variable stars @xcite , and ( 2 ) the more modern `` synthetic spectral atmosphere fitting '' method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both techniques require the comparison of high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) photometry and spectra of a given object to model atmospheres ; for the second method , synthesized spectra are computed for each sn in detail .",
    "distances based on improved versions of the theoretical modeling for a handful of well - observed sneii - p have been shown to be precise to 10% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not greatly inferior to the best precision achievable with sneia ( 7% ; * ? ? ?",
    "the requirement of high s / n observations , however , limits the efficacy of this approach for events at larger distances .",
    "the standardized candle method first suggested by @xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter hp02 ) provides an independent empirical way to achieve distances to , and it is strongly anchored in simple physics . in more luminous sne , the h - recombination front is maintained at higher velocities ; the photosphere is farther out in radius .",
    "when a  is on the plateau phase of its light curve ( which lasts for around 100 rest - frame days ) , there is a strong correlation between the velocity of the weak  lines near @xmath3   that trace the photospheric velocity  and the luminosity on the plateau .",
    "extinction corrections are based on a variety of different methods .",
    "this empirical correlation was further studied by @xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter h05 ) ; application to 24 sneii - p in the hubble flow yields a hubble diagram in the @xmath4 band with a scatter of 15% in distance .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter n06 ) modified this technique by simultaneously combining both the extinction correction ( using the rest - frame @xmath5 color on the plateau ) and the  velocity correction to arrive at a simple correlation between these parameters and luminosity .",
    "given the smaller quantity of the data required , the n06 method , or a variant thereof , is probably the only framework that could be followed cost - effectively at high redshifts .",
    "the number of  for which distances have been derived , using any available method , is @xmath620 .",
    "the paucity of such objects , and the intractable biases that emerge from the way the sample was constructed , warrants an analysis of more sne , and push for improved and better - tested correlations that will allow one to achieve the precision and control of systematics that could make these sne competitive tools for precision cosmology .    in this work ,",
    "we add 17 new objects to the current sample of low-@xmath7 , almost doubling the size , and reanalyze 3 previously published events .",
    "we discuss the full sample construction in ",
    "[ s : sample ] . in  [ s : method ] we present and modify the n06 fitting method .",
    "we discuss in ",
    "[ s : results ] the sample culling , derive a new hubble diagram , and find that the scatter is @xmath610% in distance ; we also consider the robustness and possible biases in the method , and compare distances derived for sne that occurred in the same host galaxy , checking for internal consistency .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ s : conclude ] .",
    "n06 compiled a list of 24 , 6 of which had not yet been published ; one new event ( sn 2004dh ) was studied as part of the caltech core collapse project ( cccp ; @xcite ) and is at low redshift , while the other 5 are at moderate redshifts , @xmath8 , found in the course of the supernova legacy survey @xcite .",
    "the other 18 sne , previously collected by h05 and hp02 , were found and observed between 1986 and 2000 , with a variety of instruments .",
    "all of those sne had @xmath9 , though the majority were at @xmath10 .",
    "for such nearby objects peculiar velocities of the host galaxies dominate the error budget , thus complicating the derivation of robust correlations and distances .",
    "since a `` standard '' hubble diagram of distance modulus vs. redshift assumes that the sole contribution to the redshifts is cosmological , we apply corrections to the heliocentric redshifts in order to account for the peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies . following previous authors , in the analysis below we correct the heliocentric redshifts derived from the sne and their host galaxies to the local hubble flow using the @xcite prescription .",
    "we further assume a hubble constant @xmath11kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 .",
    "since we later fit for the absolute magnitude of the sne , @xmath13 merely serves as a convenient scaling constant . for sn1999em",
    ", we derive a redshift using the hubble law and the cepheid distance measured by @xcite , @xmath14mpc .",
    "we re - reduced the images of sn2004dh and report here new photometry for that event . finally ,",
    "following h05 , we remove sn2000cb from the sample , since it is now believed to be a sn1987a - like event rather than a classic .",
    "hereafter we will refer to these 23 sne as the `` hpn sample''(for hamuy , pinto , and nugent ) .",
    "the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) is mostly known as the sn discovery engine of the lick observatory sn search ( loss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a substantial fraction of its time is dedicated to follow - up broadband photometry of nearby sne . as part of this program ,",
    "dozens of sneii have been monitored in the past ten years .",
    "we select the  from the kait sample , since other core - collapse sn subtypes are not necessarily expected to obey the same correlations .",
    "however , the  subclass is not well defined . while historically sne were classified by their light - curve shapes , and sne with a distinctive plateau",
    "were dubbed  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is unclear how constant a plateau must be , how long that phase must last , and in which photometric bands it appears .",
    "in fact , those sne which show hydrogen in their spectra but photometrically decline linearly ( in magnitudes ) were called sne ii - l , but not a single one of the best - studied objects ( e.g. , sn1979c ) is considered a `` normal '' prototype ( e.g , @xcite , and references therein ; poznanski et al . 2009 , in prep . ) .    with the modern emphasis shifting to spectroscopic follow - up observations , the classification becomes , dishearteningly , even muddier .",
    "it is often assumed by sn observers that only  exhibit hydrogen lines having p - cygni profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but this claim has not been explored systematically . lately , several core - collapse sne with extreme luminosities have been discovered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stretching the classification scheme beyond its current limits .",
    "for the purpose of this work , we define the  subclass as follows : ( a ) prominent hydrogen features in the spectra , ( b ) no narrow emission lines indicative of interaction with the circumburst medium , and ( c ) a prominent `` plateau '' phase in the @xmath4-band light curve .",

    "the systematic scatter is equivalent to an 18% uncertainty in distance , largely dominating the error budget , being more than twice the median measurement uncertainty .",

    "those sne are offset from the best - fit solution by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "an analysis excluding those objects gives a tight correlation with @xmath52mag , which corresponds to 10% in distance .",
    "a possible glimpse at the source of the discrepancy lies in the photometric behavior of the outlying sne .",
    "this is portrayed in figure [ f : decline ] , where we show , for the kait sne , the distance from the hubble law ( as derived from the complete sample ) in @xmath53 units , as a function of the decline rate in the @xmath4 band .",
    "we define here the decline rate as the slope of a linear fit to the @xmath4-band light curve starting 10  d after explosion ( after the rise time ) , and ending at day 50 , in units of mag ( 50  d)@xmath12 .",
    "the errors are estimated using a monte - carlo simulation propagating the uncertainties in the photometry and in the explosion dates .",
    "figure [ f : decline ] shows that sn2001cy and sn2001do have substantial decline rates , about 0.5  mag ( 50  d)@xmath12 , while most objects barely decline , or even have rising light curves .",
    "the decline vs. offset correlation is not strong ; consequently , adding a decline parameter to the fitting only marginally improves the scatter to @xmath54mag .",
    "however , we can now define quantitatively a selective subsample of  for the purpose of distance measurement in this paper , and reject objects in a controlled manner . for the purpose of this work",
    ", we will keep objects that have decline rates smaller than ( or consistent to 1@xmath53 with ) zero .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ f : decline ] , this criterion rejects all three outliers ( sne2001cy , 2001do , and 1999bg ) by design , but also sne2000dc , 2002gd , and 2004du that are relatively well fit .",
    "this choice leaves 34 sne in the combined sample that we analyze in the following sections .",
    "we emphasize that a similar cut has been applied by n06 prior to the costly follow - up observations of the moderate-@xmath7 sne in their sample ( p. nugent , 2008 , private comm . ) , and has most probably been applied to the hp02 sample as well .",
    "the precise criteria have not been detailed previously , and could significantly bias the best - fit parameters and dispersion . our choice , while",
    "somewhat arbitrary , does not affect our results below , and any choice that rejects the two major outliers will effectively be equivalent .      using the culled sample of 34 sne , we find that the best - fit values after marginalization are @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58mag , and @xmath52mag ( 10% in distance ) , consistent with the values for the complete sample .",
    "the likelihood contours and the marginalized posteriors are plotted in figure [ f : contours ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the coefficients are weakly covariant .    the value of the best - fit average @xmath29 , while small , is consistent with results for many sne ia , which tend to suffer an extinction that is very selective @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , this result could be explained with a fairly simple model where `` normal , '' yet circumstellar , dust causes heavily color - dependent scattering .",
    "while this model is discussed in the context of sneia , core - collapse sne are expected ( and observed ) to be enshrouded by more circumstellar dust , which could explain these low @xmath29 values .",
    "we note that a small @xmath29 is still the best fit if one removes the highly extinguished sn2002hh from the analysis .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : dl ] ) we build the hubble diagram in figure [ f : hd ] .",
    "the scatter around the standard cosmology trend is quite small , and is accounted for by the systematic and measurement uncertainties .",
    "the systematic scatter can be contained in a reasonable velocity dispersion of @xmath59kms@xmath12 .",
    "this is equivalent to , or better than , the results obtained by previous authors , and is encouraging considering the size of the sample and its initial inhomogeneity .      in order to test the robustness of the correlation",
    ", we explore the importance of the different ingredients in the fit . if one applies _ no correction at all _",
    "( i.e. , assume the  are perfect standard candles ) , the correlation crumbles , and gives @xmath60 mag .",
    "the same occurs if one does not apply the velocity correction , but only the color correction .",
    "a simple test of the importance of that term is obtained by shuffling the velocity measurements among the objects , assigning to each sn a random value chosen from the sample distribution .",
    "the result , on average , is a very weak correlation , with @xmath61 mag , and unrealistic best values for the coefficients ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 in most cases ; see @xcite for a review on measured values and theoretical limits on @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , if we use solely the  correction ( which is numerically equivalent to setting @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) , we get a scatter only slightly greater than for the best solution ( @xmath66 mag ) , and mildly different values for @xmath38 and @xmath40 .",
    "this result indicates that for our sample of sne , the dust correction is not strongly required by the data .",
    "since we _ do _ expect sn magnitudes to be affected by dust , there are a few possible explanations we consider .",
    "first , it could be that an intrinsic color - velocity correlation masks most of the contribution from dust .",
    "while theoretically one could expect the color ( i.e. , the temperature ) to be correlated with the photospheric velocity at least to some extent , we find no indication in the sample for any such covariance , despite having at least a few sne suffering negligible extinctions .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the sample is heavily biased toward dust - free objects . while this is securely wrong for at least one object ( sn2002hh , which suffers @xmath65 mag of extinction in the @xmath67 band ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is probably wrong for many of the other sne as well .",
    "h05 finds significant dust corrections for at least some of the sne in his sample , and our sample should be less `` hand - picked '' as the objects included were discovered by modern - era ccd - equipped sn searches that can find more  buried in their host galaxies .",
    "however , neglecting sn2002hh , most sne in the sample are within @xmath68mag of the sample s mean  color .",
    "additionally , for any reasonable dust law , the color term in equation ( [ eq : dl ] ) is at least 35 times less significant than the velocity term , so that even substantial differences in color will contribute relatively little to the dispersion in distance moduli .",
    "consequently , a sample that does not have many heavily extinguished objects can be fit about as well when assuming no extinction at all .",
    "we have searched unsuccessfully for parameters that correlate with the residuals from the hubble diagram and further reduce the necessary @xmath39 value , other than the slope of the plateau in the light curve that we have used to cull our sample in  [ s : culling ] .",
    "the @xmath69-band luminosity at day 50 , for example , does not reduce the scatter by more than a few percent of its previous value .",
    "there are indications that rejection of red objects ( those having @xmath70 mag ) may reduce the scatter , but our sample is still too small for us to make a robust statement regarding this .",
    "we also determine the best - fit parameters for different subsamples of the data .",
    "the hpn and kait samples when analyzed separately give best - fit parameters consistent to within @xmath71 with those derived from the full set . when examining various cuts in redshift , we find that the lowest - redshift objects in the sample ( @xmath72 ) tend to pull the solutions to somewhat larger values of @xmath38 ( near 6 instead of 5 ) , as previously noted by n06 and tentatively ascribed to a malmquist bias . at @xmath73",
    "there seems to be a systematic difference between the two samples , with the kait sne being mostly underneath the hubble - law line .",
    "the number of sne in this range is too small for a conclusive analysis , but we estimate that this is a reflection of the differences between the samples noted in  [ s : compsamp ] .",
    "kait finds intrinsically fainter and more extinguished sne , for which the fit compensates by reducing their derived distances .",
    "sn2002hh and sn2004et both occurred in the same host galaxy , ngc6946 , a neighbor of the milky way ( @xmath74mpc away ) .",
    "while sn2004et shows no apparent uniqueness ( except perhaps some small photometric jitter in the plateau phase of the light curve ) , sn2002hh is highly reddened by dust , with @xmath75 mag and an infrared echo from a shell with @xmath610 m@xmath76 @xcite . despite the extreme extinction ,",
    "the distances of the two sne , as derived using the best - fit parameters of  [ s : bestfit ] , are consistent within about @xmath77 ( see table [ t : final ] ) .",
    "sn2003hl and sn2003iq exploded within weeks of each other , in the same host galaxy , ngc772 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : ngc0772 ] , left panel ) .",
    "in fact , sn2003iq was discovered by an amateur sn observer while following 2003hl @xcite . with the exception of the first spectrum of sn2003hl",
    ", our spectra were obtained by placing the slit on both objects simultaneously . in this lower - extinction case ( compared with sn2002hh in ngc6946 ) , the agreement in distance is even better .    however , the distances to both pairs of sne best agree only for the favored model with low @xmath29 .",
    "( a similar value for sn2002hh has been measured by @xcite using a full light - curve comparison to sn1999em . )",
    "as seen in the right - hand panel of figure [ f : ngc0772 ] , a value of @xmath25 is rejected at a combined significance level higher than @xmath78 .",
    "this result strongly supports the low @xmath29 value favored by the full sample .      while the scatter we find in  [ s : bestfit ] is small ,",
    "it is tightly coupled to our error estimates .",
    "the value @xmath79mag is in effect the scatter unaccounted for by other error terms .",
    "as can be seen in table [ t : final ] , due to the quality of our data , our uncertainties are generally smaller than those of previous authors . if one argues that those uncertainties are underestimated ( though we find that they are not ) , increasing them by some amount will result in an even smaller value of @xmath39 .    as a consequence of our precise measurements ,",
    "systematic errors dominate our hubble diagram .",
    "this allows us to constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the correlation to be roughly 10% in distance .",
    "however , one should note that there are observational limitations that would increase that uncertainty for any foreseeable sample . even for data with exquisite photometry , and high s",
    "/ n spectroscopy , there still remains an uncertainty in the peculiar velocity of the exploding star , on the order of 150kms@xmath12 .",
    "this translates to about 0.05@xmath240.08mag of uncertainty , i.e. , 2@xmath244% in distance .",
    "a reasonable precision to expect for a sn with a single spectrum is about 300kms@xmath12 , or @xmath60.12mag .",
    "in addition , any project that wishes to amass a suitable sample of  will need to address the critical issue of sample definition discussed in  [ s : culling ] . a simple strategy to overcome",
    "this would include high - cadence observations during a `` detection phase , '' in order to have strong constraints on the explosion dates , followed by low - cadence monitoring of the candidates , in order to ascertain that they do not decline .",
    "the weak dependence on  color discussed in  [ s : robust ] has strong utility for extension to high-@xmath7 sne , where selection against faint and reddened sne is stronger , and dust could have less impact .",
    "a hubble diagram based only on the @xmath67 band , without any color term , is equivalent to fixing @xmath80 in equation ( [ eq : dl ] ) . solving for the other parameters , we find a somewhat inferior scatter of @xmath81 mag .",
    "however , obtaining rest - frame @xmath4-band magnitudes for @xmath82 sne is observationally challenging , requiring near - infrared observations . the slightly poorer scatter in the @xmath67 band can be overcome by statistics .",
    "we do not expect significant scatter ( or evolution ) in those photometric bands due to metallicity .",
    "figure 13 of @xcite shows that wildly different metallicities produce little variance in the intrinsic colors of  at wavelengths longer than @xmath65000 .",
    "future low-@xmath7 samples will also allow a better quantitative determination of the cutoff in decline rate that separates `` good standardizable '' from other sne .",
    "using a sample that is larger and more diverse than those studied previously , we have shown that  can be calibrated using simple correlations , yielding a tight hubble diagram with a dispersion of @xmath610% in distance , not much worse than for sneia , if one carefully constructs the sample of sne .",
    "we have shown that the n06 standardization method , a derivative of the hp02 method , might be simplified even further because the correction for dust extinction , based on the current sample , has a low statistical impact on the scatter in the hubble diagram .",
    "this implies that a distance measurement could , in principle , be obtained with a single spectrum of a sn during the plateau phase , combined with rest - frame @xmath67 or @xmath4-band photometry at a similar time .",
    "however , additional ( lower s / n ) photometry is required during the plateau phase , in order to reject non - ii - p sne .",
    "if dust correction is applied , the best - fit solution prefers a very steep dust law , with @xmath0 , as recently indicated for sneia .",
    "this may have significant implications for snia cosmology , where systematic uncertainties currently dominate .",
    "it is further supported by two pairs of sne that occurred in the same host galaxies , and whose distances agree only for low @xmath29 values .    the hubble diagram in figure  [ f : hd ] is dominated by nearby objects , where systemic velocities of the host galaxies govern the error bars .",
    "more exact values of the parameters , and more confidence in the method , will require the analysis of a sample of sne in the hubble flow .",
