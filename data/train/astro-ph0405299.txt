    "the neutron star subclass of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) presently consists of four confirmed ( sgr0526@xmath266 , 1806@xmath220 , 1900@xmath314 , 1627@xmath241 ; see hurely 2000 and kouveliotou 2004 for recent reviews ) and one candidate member ( sgr  @xmath4 ; cline et al .",
    "2000 ) . at random intervals , sgrs enter active states lasting between days and years , during which they emit hundreds of predominantly soft ( @xmath5 kev ) , and short ( @xmath6 ms duration ) events . during quiescence , sgrs are persistent x - ray sources ( @xmath7 kev ) with luminosities ranging between @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "spin periods , narrowly clustered between @xmath10 s , have been found in three sgr quiescent x - ray light curves .",
    "estimates of their spin - down rates indicate that sgr magnetic fields are @xmath11 g ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; kulkarni et al . 2003 ) confirming theoretical predictions ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ) for the existence of such high @xmath12-field objects ( magnetars ) .    besides sgrs , there is today clear evidence that another class of neutron stars , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , possess similar magnetic fields and sgr - like outbursts ( see mereghetti et al .",
    "2002 for a review ; also kaspi et al .",
    "2004 ) . to date",
    "there are roughly ten confirmed magnetars ( axps and sgrs ) and two to three candidate sources .",
    "however , it is still unclear how these two object classes are linked , how they produce their unique bursting patterns , and how they may be related to the subset of normal radio pulsars that exhibit magnetic fields comparable or even larger than those of sgrs and axps ( see heyl @xmath13 hernquist 2003 for a recent discussion of these issues )",
    ". studies of possible progenitors for sgrs and axps would provide robust constraints on their ages and their birth rates and thus shed light on their evolutionary paths . thus far , associations between magnetars and supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been established only for a few axps and potentially in one sgr ( gaensler et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "the identification of sgrs with fossils of their births thus remains an open issue .",
    "three of the four sgrs lie in the galactic plane with extinctions of @xmath14 magnitudes in the optical band .",
    "consequently , infrared is the optimal band for counterpart searches and for studying their environments .",
    "however , sgr  @xmath0 , resides in the large magellanic cloud , with very low extinction ( @xmath15 mag ) , allowing for both optical and ir observations .",
    "fuchs et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied sgr1806@xmath220 with iso and reported the discovery of a dusty , compact stellar cluster 7@xmath16 away both from the sgr position and from the luminous blue variable star , lbv1806@xmath220 , previously suggested as a potential sgr counterpart ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "corbel & eikenberry ( 2003 ) argue that both objects are associated with this cluster .",
    "recently , vrba et al . ( 2000 ) discovered a similar compact stellar cluster in the x - ray error box of sgr1900 + 14 .",
    "this cluster is very close ( @xmath17pc ) to a transient radio source discovered by frail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) during the 1998 giant flare from the source ( hurley et al .",
    "the infrared appearance of this cluster is dominated by its most luminous members , two m5 supergiants ( vrba et al .",
    "1996 ; guenther , klose , & vrba 2000 ) .",
    "these findings led to the suggestion that both sgrs originated in nearby compact stellar clusters ( vrba et al .",
    "2000 ) and that sgr progenitors may be very massive stars . to further investigate this hypothesis we focus here on sgr0526@xmath2 66 .",
    "sgr  @xmath0 was active from the mid 1970s until 1983 and has been in a quiescent state since then ( aptekar et al .",
    "on 5 march 1979 , the source emitted the most energetic sgr burst ever recorded ( mazets et al .",
    "1979 ) , with a peak luminosity of over @xmath18 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "the extreme intensity and the sharp rise time ( 0.2ms ) of this event enabled the first accurate localization of an sgr source at the edge of the bright snr n49 in the lmc ( cline et al .",
    "this location was later improved with _",
    "observations to a 0.6@xmath16 uncertainty ( kulkarni et al .",
    "kaplan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed n49 with the hubble space telescope but could not identify an optical counterpart for the sgr brighter than @xmath126.5 mag ( f814w filter ) .",
    "here we report on the results of deep near - infrared ( nir ) observations of the n49 region using the vlt .",
    "while it was not our primary goal to detect the nir counterpart of sgr  @xmath0 , we searched for a third cluster - sgr association , which would strengthen the case for a physical link between sgrs and young stellar clusters of massive stars .",
    "we conducted near - infrared imaging of the n49 region using vlt / isaac in early 2003 ( table [ log ] ) .",
    "isaac makes use of a 1024@xmath191024 pixel rockwell hg : cd : te array and offers a plate scale of 0147 per pixel . because the spectral appearance of n49 is characterized by strong fe emission lines and a fainter emission component in hydrogen recombination lines ( oliva et al .",
    "1989 ; dickel et al .",
    "1995 ) , we utilized a combination of broad- and narrow - band filters for imaging . the narrow - band images ( in [ fe ii ] at 1.257@xmath20 m , [ fe ii ] at 1.64@xmath20 m , and br@xmath21 at 2.17@xmath20 m )",
    "were used to subtract the nebular contribution from the broad - band images ( @xmath22 ) , allowing the discrimination of continuum sources , i.e. a potentially hidden stellar cluster , and emission - line knots of the snr .",
    "all images were analyzed consistently .",
    "after standard image processing steps ( flatfielding , stacking ) , all stars were extracted using daophot as implemented in iraf .",
    "psf - fitting was used with fitting width typically one fwhm radius .",
    "psf stars were carefully selected to ensure that no background contamination was present and that all objects were stellar . after extraction",
    ", photometry was performed using ukirt infrared standard stars fs 6 , 14 and 20 observed with vlt / isaac .",
    "we first searched the nir data for evidence of a stellar cluster very close to sgr 052666 .",
    "after removal of the bright line emission from n49 , we find no evidence for a cluster in projection against the supernova remnant .",
    "instead , we find a remarkable excess of @xmath23-band flux in the south - eastern part of n49 ( fig .",
    "[ snr ] ) .",
    "this feature is not seen in our br@xmath21 narrow - band image but has a mid- and far - infrared counterpart .",
    "the n49 region was observed in the far - infrared with iras and in the mid - ir by the msx satellite during its galactic plane survey .",
    "the iras data were discussed by van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1996 , their figure 1 ) . the brightest source in the field",
    "is recorded in the iras catalog with coordinates r.a .",

    "the msx data of the snr show a bright and extended source at 8.28@xmath20 m with its center approximately at coordinates r.a .",
    "( j2000 ) = 5@xmath2926@xmath30038 , 66@xmath2605@xmath2705@xmath28 ( fig",
    ".  [ msx ] ) , which on our images coincides with the center of the region where the supernova remnant shows the excess of @xmath23-band flux . since the coordinates of this source / region basically agree with the coordinates of iras 052596607 originally published by graham et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , we consider it likely that we have imaged the short - wavelength counterpart of this iras source . though it is believed that here the expanding snr encounters an interstellar cloud ( banas et al .",
    "1997 ) , based on our data we can not uniquely identify the origin of this source and the excess @xmath23-band flux .",
    "while we have not found a stellar cluster hidden by the bright line emission of the snr , a stellar cluster in the vicinity of the snr does exist .",
    "this cluster is located about 130 arcsec north - east from the quiescent x - ray counterpart of the sgr ( kulkarni et al .",
    "2003 ) , corresponding to a projected distance of @xmath130 pc ( fig .",
    "[ thecluster ] ) . this relatively unexplored cluster ( cataloged as sl  463 as a member of the ob association lh  53 ; hill et al .",
    "1995 ; kontizas et al . 1994 ) coincides with a bright sub - mm source ( yamaguchi et al .",
    "2001 ) , indicating that it contains large amounts of gas and dust .",
    "many objects in this field are highly reddened , indicating on - going star - formation in this region of the lmc .",
    "the @xmath23 vs. @xmath31 color - magnitude diagram of this cluster indicates the presence of several dozen b - type main - sequence stars and possibly one supergiant ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) , although we can not exclude that this is a galactic foreground star ( the brightest star in fig  [ thecluster ] ) .",
    "most members of sl  463 are extinct by less than 1 magnitude , although several stars might be affected by somewhat stronger exinction . within a radius @xmath32 pc of the suspected cluster center ( for an assumed distance of 50 kpc ) ,",
    "fifty sources are visible on our isaac images . for thirty one of them we have accurate photometry to a limiting magnitude of 19.5 mag in @xmath33 . in the outer regions of the cluster , between 2.1 and 4.2 pc ,",
    "an additional ninety stars are detected .",
    "based on a potential relation between the radius of a young stellar cluster and its age ( maz - apellniz 2001 ) , the age of sl  463 is between 5 and 20 myr , in agreement with age estimates of the entire lh  53 complex ( hill et al .",
    "1995 ; yamaguchi et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "compared to the clusters found in close projection to sgr1900 + 14 and 180620 , the cluster sl  463 is older and larger , but apparently still enshrouded by dust , and located much farther away from the corresponding sgr . with respect to the origin of sgr052666",
    "we briefly consider two scenarios .",
    "_ first , assuming the cluster was the birthplace of the sgr progenitor , the sgr must have been ejected from the cluster with a space velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath9 in order to travel a projected distance of 30 pc within @xmath35 myr , where @xmath36 is the angle between the line of sight and the moving direction of the sgr .",
    "if the sgr progenitor and the stellar cluster are coeveal , a cluster age of @xmath110 myr would imply an initial mass of this star of @xmath37m@xmath38 ( hill et al .",
    "numerical models of the dissolution of young massive clusters have shown that an ejection of stars with initial masses of 5 to 10m@xmath38 with velocities of the order of 10 to 40 km s@xmath9 indeed occurs ( vine & bonnell 2003 ) , if the gas - to - stellar mass ratio in the cluster is relatively high ( as it seems to be the case for sl  463 ) .",
    "_ second , if sgr 052666 was born as a magnetar within this stellar cluster , given its current offset from the cluster and allowing for an ejection velocity of order 300@xmath39 km s@xmath9 its age must be about @xmath40 yrs .",
    "this predicts a proper motion of the sgr of @xmath1 1 milliarcsec @xmath39 per year along a direction away from the stellar cluster . _ _    a field strength of about @xmath41 g was inferred from the @xmath42 relation for the quiescent x - ray counterpart of the sgr ( kulkarni et al .",
    "if the magnetar is coeval with snr n49 ( @xmath1 5000 years ) , such a field strength would be consistent with the magnetar age . on the other hand , for an age of 10@xmath43 years required by an sgr - cluster association ,",
    "the current @xmath12-field depends on the assumed evolution model .",
    "if the field evolves through crustal ohmic decay , perhaps accelerated by a hall cascade , irrespective of the initial field strength the remaining field after 10@xmath43 years will be @xmath1 10@xmath44 g , which is inconsistent with the value inferred from the @xmath45-@xmath46 relation .",
    "however , if the field is anchored in the core and evolves via ambipolar diffusion , then a surface field strength of @xmath41 g after 10@xmath43 years is easily conceivable . under certain conditions",
    ", magnetars may be able to sustain high field strengths over such a long period of time ( colpi , geppert , & page 2000 ) .",
    "in other words , the observed field characteristics of the quiescent x - ray counterpart of the sgr do not exclude the possibility that the birth of the sgr took place within the stellar cluster sl  463 .",
    "we performed a nir survey towards the n49 region in the lmc , and address the question of the circumstances of the formation of sgr 052666 .",
    "we imaged the young and presumably dusty stellar cluster sl  463 , located only @xmath47 pc away ( projected distance ) from the sgr .",
    "it is possible that sgr 052666 was born in this cluster , but our observations do not allow us to claim with certainty that the sgr or its progenitor was born within this cluster .",
    "however , the fact that similar clusters have been found at or near the positions of the three best - studied sgrs ( 1900 + 14 , 180620 , and 052666 ) argues in favor of a cluster / sgr connection .",
    "if this association is real , we can constrain the age , and thus the initial mass of the sgr progenitor . in all three cases the masses turn out to be 20m@xmath38 .",
    "this would place sgr progenitors among the most massive stars with solar metallicity that can produce neutron star remnants ( heger et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we are highly indebted to the eso staff at paranal for performing the observations in service mode .",
    "this research made use of data products from the midcourse space experiment .",
    "processing of the data was funded by the ballistic missile defense organization with additional support from nasa office of space science .",
    "this research has also made use of the nasa / ipac infrared science archive , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
