    "we begin by introducing the quantities studied below .",
    "a necessary ingredient in engineering a fractional chern insulator is a flat , topologically non - trivial band , defined as follows .",

    "eigenstates of the tight - binding hamiltonian are bloch functions @xmath9 indexes the bands . at a fixed @xmath10 ,",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is an @xmath11 matrix with entries @xmath12 and band energies @xmath13 . in general , for @xmath14 , neither @xmath15 nor @xmath16 will have the periodicity of the reciprocal lattice , and this property is not needed to define the berry curvature via eq .",
    "( [ eq_curvature_def ] ) below . imposing this periodicity by hand has led to demonstrably incorrect calculations in previous literature .",
    "we clarify this point with a discussion in supplementary note  1 and illustrate the consequences of incorrect computations in supplementary figs .  1 ,  2 .",
    "nontrivial topological order in a band @xmath17 is indicated by a non - vanishing value of the ( first ) chern number @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the area of the momentum - space brillouin zone , @xmath20 denotes the average over the bz , normalized so @xmath21 , and the berry curvature@xcite of the band @xmath17 is defined as @xmath22 the leading - order condition ( in terms of a long - wavelength expansion ) for the existence of an isomorphism between the band - projected density operators and the gmp algebra found in ref .",
    "is that the berry curvature should be constant as a function of @xmath10 . in the results we report here",

    "is that the quantum metric also be constant over the bz .",
    "we adopt @xmath26 as the appropriate generalization of rms fluctuation to tensor quantities .",
    "the final constraint on the band geometry is that @xmath27 it was shown in ref .   that the left - hand side of ( [ eq - detineq ] ) is always nonnegative ; the condition that it vanishes is equivalent to the condition that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the real and imaginary components of a khler metric @xmath30 .",
    "this means that , unlike the first two conditions , the metric determinant inequality @xmath31 measures deviations from lowest landau level physics , specifically .",
    "analogous conditions may be derived for higher landau levels .",
    "a stronger condition can be obtained by considering the trace of the quantum metric instead .",
    "it was additionally shown in ref .   that @xmath32 in supplementary note  2 we show that if this inequality is saturated , the quantum metric is isotropic and @xmath33 must vanish .",
    "hence the condition @xmath34 is equivalent to requiring that the algebra of band - projected density operators be identical to the gmp algebra , while @xmath35 merely requires that they be isomorphic .      the purpose of the present work is to investigate the degree to which the above criteria are satisfied in several fci models known to exhibit fqh - like phases@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we outline procedures common to all models studied .",
    "the stability of an fci phase is trivially influenced by the dispersion of the occupied band .",
    "fortunately , the dispersion of a band is independent of its berry curvature and quantum metric : the former only depends on the hamiltonian s spectrum while the latter depend only on its eigenvectors .",
    "this allows us to eliminate any dispersion - related confounding effects by energetically flattening the bands of each lattice model , which is equivalent to smearing nearest - neighbor hopping terms over an exponentially - localized area@xcite .",
    "differences between chern bands and landau levels also enter in the form of the hamiltonian s interaction term .",
    "unlike the energetic considerations , this dependence is still poorly understood , so we have limited the scope of the present paper to on - site repulsive interactions only ( which necessitates bosonic statistics ) , since this is the lattice interaction which most closely matches the isotropy present in the continuum . for each lattice model considered , we therefore investigate the bosonic laughlin state at filling fraction @xmath36 ( stabilized by a two - body delta - function interaction ) and the bosonic moore - read state at @xmath37 ( stabilized by a three - body delta - function interaction ) .",
    "these states have completely different topological orders ; furthermore the laughlin state is known to be more robust in general than the moore - read state , so examining both provides a useful probe of the sensitivity of band - geometric arguments .",
    "the band geometry hypothesis predicts that the most important factor will be berry curvature fluctuations .",
    "low curvature fluctuations were heuristically identified as a desirable criterion in the earliest fci literature@xcite , which has been well established by subsequent work ( see in particular refs .  ) . in the present work we therefore focus on the sub - leading conditions , namely the influence the quantum metric has on the gap .",
    "fluctuations of the quantum metric are predicted to be the next most relevant quantity , but in the models examined this was found to have a high degree of linear correlation with the berry curvature fluctuations ( see supplementary fig .",
    "there is no a priori reason this should be the case : other metric - derived quantities were found to be largely independent of berry curvature .",
    "in addition , we found that the trace inequality ( [ eq - trineq ] ) was far more correlated with the gap than the determinant inequality ( [ eq - detineq ] ) for all models examined , despite corresponding to a stronger condition on the algebra of density operators .",
    "these findings go beyond the scheme laid out in ref .  .",
    "due to space constraints , we present data on the dependence of the gap on the determinant condition for low values of @xmath24 in supplementary fig .  4 for the kagom lattice model and supplementary fig .  5 for the ruby lattice model .",
    "the first chern insulator model was introduced by haldane@xcite , who considered a tight - binding model on the honeycomb lattice with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor hoppings ( fig .",
    "[ fig - haldane]a ) and a peierls phase due to non - uniform threading of magnetic flux through each hexagon .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian for the haldane model is @xmath38 where the pauli sigma matrices act on the band index , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is interpreted cyclically mod 3 .",
    "the lower band has a nonzero chern number when @xmath42 .",

    ", we consider the model at @xmath43 .",
    "the energy spectrum has band crossings for these parameters , meaning that the bands can not be flattened by local operators and the model analyzed in those references is not adiabatically connected to ( [ eq - h - haldane ] ) . in practice",
    ", however , one is most interested in the @xmath44 subspace ; the hamiltonian then depends only on the combination @xmath45 , and an increase in @xmath46 which removes the crossing may then be compensated by a shift in @xmath47 which leaves the hamiltonian ( [ eq - h - haldane ] ) unchanged up to a scale .",

    "the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the fact that the models considered have different numbers of tight - binding sites per unit cell .",

    "despite the fact that the scaling argument is exact only in the large-@xmath5 limit and the models we compare have @xmath112 and @xmath113 , we find roughly similar behavior across all three models , both in terms of the magnitude of the scaled gap and of its dependence on @xmath50 and @xmath64 .",
    "in this work we have presented numerical results which systematically map out the robustness of topologically ordered fqh - like phases in fci systems with realistic , short - ranged hamiltonians and band geometry which is less than perfectly uniform .",
    "we presented quantitative evidence that the band - geometric quantities identified in ref .",
    "remain strongly correlated with the size of the gap even when its conditions on band geometry are not met exactly .",
    "this leads us to propose a geometric stability hypothesis for fqh - like phenomena in fcis : in spite of the fact that the gmp algebra is not perfectly reproduced , we conjecture that an approximate version of the single - mode approximation correctly describes the low - energy physics of these fci models . as a practical corollary , we predict that single - particle hamiltonians with more uniform band geometry  specifically , as measured by the hierarchy of three criteria  will produce more stable fqh - like states .",
    "the validity of the single - mode approximation in fcis has been investigated by a number of other authors using approaches complementary to that taken here@xcite . within the context of their hamiltonian approach to the fqhe",
    ", murthy and shankar showed that composite fermion degrees of freedom could be chosen which reproduce an exact version of the gmp algebra@xcite . more directly , in ref .",
    ", the lowest - lying neutral excitation of the kagom and ruby lattice models was found to be well described by the magnetoroton mode of the corresponding fqh state on a torus , using a phenomenological mapping between the fqh and fci hilbert spaces described in ref .  .",
    "a related mapping was originally proposed by qi@xcite , but the image of fqh pseudopotential interactions under this mapping is not well localized and strongly anisotropic@xcite , making the relationship to physical fci hamiltonians unclear .    comparing the results from the kagom and ruby lattice models , it appears easier to engineer uniform geometry in more complicated hamiltonians , both in the sense of having more tunable couplings and in the sense of having more bands .",
    "the latter property is expected to hold on general grounds , as noted in refs .  .",
    "increasing the size of the unit cell reduces the effectiveness of a fixed - strength repulsion , however , so an optimal choice would balance these two factors .",
    "this has immediate relevance to experimental design : laboratory hamiltonians are necessarily more complicated than those in idealized theoretical models ( e.g. , the proposal in ref .   involves an eight - dimensional parameterization of the applied electric field used to obtain a synthetic gauge potential . ) performing many - body simulations on a representative set of parameters in such a large space is prohibitively time - consuming ; the geometric stability hypothesis can be used to reduce this to a manageable subspace .",
    "in addition , band geometry may , by definition , be tuned independently of energetic considerations such as the bandwidth .    a pressing direction for future work is to further develop the band geometry hypothesis by investigating its validity in less straightforward scenarios : stable fci states where the berry curvature is not particularly uniform",
    "have also been proposed ; furthermore , the stability of the state may also depend on the filling fraction and the particular state sought to be stabilized@xcite . among other aspects which would be interesting to clarify are the role of bosonic versus fermionic particle statistics , nn- and longer - ranged inter - particle interactions , anisotropic interactions induced by the lattice structure , etc .",
    "in particular , the distribution of geometric quantities differs from band to band ; this can be selected by fully filling a number of bands in a fermionic system , which could lead to new phenomena .",
    "one could also consider the wide range of more elaborate fci models in the literature , possessing , e.g. , chern numbers @xmath114 , non - abelian berry curvature arising from multiple degenerate bands , etc .",
    "we direct the reader to the recent reviews@xcite for a more extensive discussion and bibliography .",
    "we study the dependence of the many - body gap on band - geometric quantities in the haldane model @xcite and models proposed for the kagom @xcite and ruby @xcite lattices .",
    "the parameter space for the haldane model hamiltonian is small enough that the vector of parameters @xmath115 which maximize the gap @xmath0 may be found from exhaustive sampling .",
    "the parameter spaces for the other two models are higher - dimensional and non - compact , so this strategy will not work .    according to the geometric stability hypothesis ,",
    "the berry curvature fluctuations @xmath50 should be inversely correlated with the gap , meaning that it may be employed as a proxy for the latter which requires far less effort to compute . in supplementary note  5",
    "we derive an expression for the derivative of @xmath50 with respect to any parameter appearing in the single - particle hamiltonian , allowing steepest - descent methods to be employed .",
    "of course , we do not expect the vector of parameters @xmath116 minimizing @xmath50 to precisely coincide with those maximizing the gap , but if the single mode approximation is applicable , @xmath116 will be a viable initial guess for @xmath115 , to be refined as described below .",
    "indeed , a state with a robust topological gap in the presence of large curvature fluctuations would be of immediate interest as an fci phase not describable in terms of an fqh universality class .    in the neighborhood of @xmath116 , a surface of constant @xmath50 in parameter space will be approximated by an ellipsoid given by the hessian of @xmath117 at @xmath116 , which may be calculated by the method in supplementary note  5 .",
    "we sample points uniformly from the surface of the ellipsoid defined by the hessian by the well - known method of projecting vectors of parameters @xmath118 sampled from the corresponding multinormal distribution .",
    "we then perturb this ellipsoid by shifting the vectors @xmath118 radially along the rays connecting each with @xmath116 until we find parameters @xmath119 such that @xmath120 is equal to the target value .",
    "these isosurfaces of different parameters with the same value of @xmath50 permit us to study the sub - leading effects of the quantum metric on the gap predicted by the geometric stability hypothesis : in fig .",
    "[ fig - kag - samples ] we depict the isosurfaces found for the kagom lattice model which were used to generate the data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - kagome - shells]b ,  d.    finally , we locate the parameters giving the maximum gap by fitting a quadratic form @xmath121 to the gaps from the isosurface data and sampling new parameters from a gaussian distribution centered on @xmath122 with covariance matrix @xmath123 .",
    "we have verified that deviations of the actual @xmath115 found from this data from the fitted value @xmath122 are negligible compared to the scales set by @xmath123 , hence this search does not need to be iterated further .",

    "unless explicitly identified otherwise , all data were obtained from exact diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian for @xmath54 bosons interacting with a two - body on - site repulsion at a filling fraction ( ratio of the number of particles to the number of unit cells ) of @xmath55 on a periodic lattice of @xmath127 unit cells ( for the laughlin - like fci state ) or @xmath69 bosons at a filling fraction of @xmath70 on a lattice of @xmath128 unit cells , interacting with a three - body on - site repulsion only ( for the moore - read - like fci state ) . in the main text we also presented additional data obtained for the fermionic laughlin - like state in the haldane model with @xmath54 particles at @xmath56 on a @xmath129 lattice with two - body nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "the fact that the bosonic moore - read state is realized in a filled landau level means that , relative to the laughlin state , we are able to simulate more particles with a many - body hilbert space of roughly the same size . flattening the spectrum of the single - particle hamiltonian",
    "removes the only other energy scale from the problem , so the strength of the repulsive interaction sets the units of the many - body gap @xmath0 .    because we do simulations for thousands of parameter values ,",
    "a detailed finite - size scaling analysis of each is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have , however , made spot checks by doing simulations of @xmath130 to @xmath131 particles at select parameter values .",

    "we have concluded that the system sizes described above strike an acceptable balance between accurately approximating the thermodynamic ( @xmath132 ) limit and making the volume of simulations manageable on the computational resources available to us .",
    "we employ several criteria to identify topological order in the results of numerical simulations , employing information from both the many - body energy spectrum and the many - body wavefunctions themselves .",
    "we first require that the spectrum has the correct number of degenerate ground states in the proper momentum sectors ( two states at @xmath133 for bosonic laughlin - type order , and three states at @xmath134 and @xmath135 for bosonic moore - read - type order ) . in a finite - size simulation",
    "these ground states will only be approximately degenerate ; we require that the gap to the lowest - energy excited state ( out of all momentum sectors ; i.e. the indirect gap ) be at least as large as the spread in ground state energies .",
    "we ascertain whether a ground state wavefunction has the topological order of the laughlin or moore - read state through properties of its entanglement spectrum @xcite : we first verify that the spectrum of the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out four bosons is gapped .",
    "there is no current quantitative theoretical interpretation of the magnitude of the entanglement gap ; instead , the discriminative power of this criterion comes from requiring that the number of eigenvalues below the gap in each momentum sector obeys counting rules dictated by the topological order of continuum fqh state @xcite . for the lattice geometry used in our studies , laughlin - type order in a system of @xmath54 bosons at @xmath136",
    "is identified by the @xmath137 counting rule ( in the terminology of the previous references ) , which requires @xmath138 states below the gap at @xmath133 , @xmath139 states below the gap in sectors @xmath140 , and @xmath141 , and @xmath142 states below the gap in all other momentum sectors .",

    "because the full hamiltonian is periodic in real space , bloch s theorem implies @xmath184 is unchanged under @xmath185 ; in other words , there exists a unitary matrix @xmath186 such that @xmath187 for _ all _ @xmath188 .",
    "because @xmath189 is independent of @xmath10 , it drops out of the expressions for the berry curvature and quantum metric , which are therefore periodic in @xmath10 .",

    "this was described as a `` gauge transformation '' in these references , but as we ve noted , the only gauge symmetry of the hamiltonian is with respect to _ bands _",

    ", we note that unlike these single - particle properties , the many - body gap is invariant under the generalized phase shift ( [ eq_not_gauge ] ) , because single - particle density operators @xmath199 are left unchanged by the transformation . as an example , in supplementary fig .",

    "we have shown that band geometry may be defined for non - periodic band hamiltonians ; we now argue that the non - periodic basis used in this paper is in fact the one measured by any ( direct or indirect ) experimental probe , and hence is the only one which should be regarded as physical .",
    "the feature possessed by bloch bands which is absent from the general theory of berry phases is the fact that the parameter space in question is defined via the fourier transform of the kinematic setting of the physical system . because this is a _",

    ", we can conclude that saturation of trace inequality ( [ eq_trineq ] ) implies saturation of the determinant inequality ( [ eq_detineq ] ) . in physical terms , a constant curvature and metric that saturate the determinant inequality imply the closure of a modified girvin - macdonald - platzman ( gmp ) algebra ; saturation of the trace inequality then corresponds to the stronger condition that the algebra of band projected density operators is not only isomorphic to the gmp algebra , but identical to it .",
    "by adding suitably chosen exponentially - localized couplings , any two - band hamiltonian may be brought to a band - flattened form parameterized by a unit 3-vector @xmath210 , where @xmath211 are the three pauli matrices .",
    "the eigenvectors of the original and flattened hamiltonians are identical ( by construction ) and can be obtained analytically : @xmath212 using this expression gives the berry curvature and quantum metric of the lower band as @xmath213 since @xmath214 . using this and standard identities relating multiple dot and cross products , it follows that @xmath215 the determinant condition @xmath216 is necessarily satisfied for any two - band model .",
    "as our results with the kagom and ruby lattice models show , this ceases to be the case for models having more than two bands .",
    "fractional chern insulators ( fcis ) exhibit states which may be thought of as discretizations of continuum fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states , in that they have identical topological and long - wavelength properties ( see , e.g. , supplementary ref . ) . to that end , consider a continuum position - space wavefunction @xmath217 which is discretized to set of values @xmath218 in a tight - binding model with @xmath5 sites per unit cell .",
    "the normalization conditions on the corresponding bloch functions are @xmath219 for any @xmath10 , where the integral is taken over a unit cell of the lattice . in the limit of large @xmath5 , we may assume that @xmath220 at @xmath221 is proportional to the discretized value @xmath222 .",
    "approximating the continuum normalization integral by a sum introduces a factor of @xmath223 from the integration measure , which is compensated by the scaling @xmath224    now consider the matrix elements of the delta - function interaction employed in the main text to stabilize the bosonic laughlin state . in the continuum , these are @xmath225 times a momentum - conserving @xmath226-function . comparing this with an on - site interaction in the discretized model @xmath227 and using shows that the discretized interaction strength should be scaled as @xmath228 this means that , given gaps which have been obtained for the fci laughlin state in two lattice models @xmath229 , the quantities which should be compared are @xmath230 and @xmath231 ( assuming that the single - particle dispersion has been flattened ; i.e. that the gap is only set by the interaction term . )",
    "similar considerations show that for the three - body delta - function interaction used to stabilize the moore - read state , the leading scaling should be @xmath232 .",
    "we note that the above argument is not as simple as it may appear : we re implicitly assuming @xmath217 has the character of a low - lying eigenstate  more specifically , that it has support over almost all tight - binding orbitals .",
    "this is the case when @xmath222 is a randomly chosen vector from the @xmath5-dimensional band hilbert space , but one can easily construct counterexamples violating this assumption : for example , let lattice model @xmath233 ( with @xmath234 ) have a block - diagonal kinetic term , the first block of which is identical to the kinetic term of model @xmath235 and the second block of which describes additional , trivial `` spectator '' orbitals with very high occupation energies .",
    "the low - lying bands @xmath236 will have vanishing amplitude on these spectator orbitals , and will numerically be identical to the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath237 of model @xmath235 , with zeros appended . in this scenario ,",
    "the eigenfunction scaling assumption is violated , and the interaction strength ( and gap size ) would _ not _ scale with the number of spectator orbitals .",
    "the scaling argument can be placed on a more rigorous footing in the context of the hofstadter model@xcite in the limit of small flux per plaquette @xmath238 , which offers a sequence of lattice models ( with @xmath239 bands ) which converges to the continuum fqhe in the @xmath132 limit . in this case , the scalings , are numerically observed to be obeyed to high accuracy@xcite . for the case of the fci models studied in this work , we know",
    "the ground states of different models lie in the same universality class as the continuum fqhe state ( as can be determined by topological order , done here by entanglement spectrum counting ) , but we do not expect , e.g. , the ruby lattice model ground state to be an interpolation of the kagom lattice model ground state . the fact that we observe the scaled gaps to be so close to each other provides an _ a posteriori _ confirmation of this argument s validity even for the relatively small values of @xmath240 .",
    "the berry curvature and quantum metric are defined in terms of the derivatives of a wavefunction over some parameter manifold . for both numerical and theoretical purposes ,",
    "it becomes convenient to recast these expressions in terms of derivatives of the hamiltonian itself , rather than its eigenfunctions , since ordinarily only the former is known analytically .",
    "this , of course , is not a new observation @xcite .    in order to avoid overall phase ambiguities and the necessity of using multiple charts to cover the brillouin zone ( bz ) in topologically non - trivial situations",
    ", it s preferable to work with the occupied band projector @xmath241 , instead of the eigenfunction @xmath242 itself . in these terms",
    ", the feynman - hellman theorems are @xmath243 where the projected resolvent operator @xmath244 is @xmath245 equations ( [ eq_de_def ] ) and ( [ eq_dp_def ] ) hold for any parameter @xmath246 upon which the hamiltonian smoothly depends , and they are valid for arbitrary values of @xmath246 and hence may be further differentiated .    assuming no additional degeneracies , @xmath247 may be inverted in the subspace orthogonal to @xmath248 , and @xmath249 the relations ( [ eq_de_def ] ) , ( [ eq_dp_def ] ) and ( [ eq_dr_def ] ) then form a closed system and may be iterated to any order to develop the taylor expansion of band - geometric quantities .",

    "these may , in turn , be used to find the variation in brillouin zone - averaged quantities with respect to couplings in the hamiltonian ; for example , denoting by @xmath253 the brillouin zone average,@xmath254 here we ve made use of the fact that @xmath255 while we remain in the same topological phase , which can easily be checked during numerical computations . using ( [ eq_curvature_gradient ] ) in ( [ eq_rms_curvature_gradient ] ) then permits us to rapidly perform a steepest - descent minimization of berry curvature fluctuations , even in a high - dimensional parameter space .",
