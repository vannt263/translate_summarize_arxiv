    "because flavor changing neutral currents are forbidden in the standard model , electroweak penguins such as @xmath0 give a direct look at loop and box processes .",
    "the inclusive branching fraction for @xmath0 is important for restricting physics beyond the standard model , and cleo s 1995 published result@xcite of @xmath36 generated much theoretical interest@xcite .",
    "the branching fraction result presented here is an improved measurement with 60% additional data and enhanced analysis techniques .",
    "the theoretical branching fraction prediction from the standard model has also improved , with a full next - to - leading - log calculation@xcite of @xmath37 .",
    "we also introduce a new analysis : a search for cp asymmetry in @xmath38 .",
    "data for these analyses were taken with the cleo detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) with center of mass energy at the @xmath39 resonance ( 10.58 gev ) .",
    "additional data were taken 60 mev below the @xmath39 ( off - resonance ) for continuum background subtraction . the cleo detector@xcite measures charged particles over 95% of 4@xmath40 steradians with a system of cylindrical drift chambers .",
    "the barrel and endcap csi calorimeters cover 98% of 4@xmath40 , and the energy resolution for photons near 2.5 gev in the central angular region @xmath41 is 2% . in 1995 ,",
    "a silicon vertex detector replaced the inner most tracking chamber , though it is not used in the analyses described here .",
    "this analysis is discussed in detail elsewhere@xcite and is briefly covered here .",
    "the signal for @xmath0 is a photon from @xmath42 meson decay with @xmath43  gev ( the published analysis@xcite used @xmath44  gev ) .",
    "the fermi momentum of the @xmath45 quark in the @xmath42 meson and the momentum of the @xmath42 meson in the lab frame ( @xmath42 mesons are produced from @xmath39 decays with approximately 300  mev/@xmath46 of momentum at cesr ) doppler broadens the photon line .",
    "calculations using a spectator model@xcite indicate that 85 - 94% of the signal lies in the photon energy range .    to obtain a photon energy spectrum , we select hadronic events with a high energy calorimeter cluster in the central region @xmath47 .",
    "we reject a cluster if , when paired with another calorimeter cluster in the event , it forms a combined @xmath48 mass consistent with a @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "we also require the cluster shape be consistent with that of a single high energy photon .",
    "a nave approach to this analysis would be to measure the photon spectrum in on - resonance data and use the off - resonance data to subtract the continuum background .",
    "but the backgrounds from continuum with initial state radiation ( @xmath51 ) ( isr ) and from continuum processes ( @xmath52 ) involving a high energy @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath53 where one of the daughter photons is not detected dominate to such an extent that extraction of a signal is impossible .",
    "we therefore suppress the continuum background with two separate methods and subtract what remains with off - resonance data .",
    "the first continuum suppression scheme@xcite involves exploiting differences in the event shapes between signal ( @xmath54 ) and continuum .",
    "while continuum events appear jetty and continuum with isr appear jetty when transformed to the rest frame of the system after the initial state radiation , the signal events are spherical due to the other @xmath42 meson decaying in the event .",
    "we characterize the event shape with eight variables[6 ] : the fox - wolfram second moment ( @xmath55 ) , ratio of the sum of transverse momenta of particles more than 45@xmath56 away from the high energy photon axis to the total scalar sum of particle momenta in the event excluding the momentum of the high energy photon ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath55 transformed to the rest frame of the system after isr ( assuming the high energy photon in the event is initial state radiation ) ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 between the photon and the thrust axis of the rest of the event transformed into the rest frame of the system after isr ( @xmath60 ) , and the energies of particles found in 20@xmath56 and 30@xmath56 cones parallel and anti - parallel to the high energy photon direction . since no one variable provides enough discriminating power , we combine them with a neural network into a single variable @xmath61 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath61 tends towards @xmath62 for continuum and isr events and @xmath63 for signal @xmath3 events .",
    "this shape method is approximately 30% efficient for signal .",
    "the other method of suppressing continuum and isr events is a pseudo - reconstruction of the parent @xmath42 meson involved in the @xmath3 decay .",
    "we look for a charged or neutral kaon with up to four pions , one of which may be a @xmath49 , which when combined with the high energy photon are consistent with being the decay products of a @xmath42 meson .",
    "we try all combinations of kaons and pions given the above restrictions and choose the one that minimizes a @xmath64 that includes , @xmath65 as well as contributions from particle identification such as @xmath66 and @xmath49 and @xmath67 mass deviations . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath68 is the beam - constrained mass , where @xmath69 is the vector sum of particle momenta comprising the @xmath42 meson candidate , @xmath70 is the @xmath42 mass ( 5.28 gev / c@xmath71 ) , @xmath72 is the energy of the candidate @xmath42 , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the resolutions on the beam constrained mass and the measured @xmath42 energy respectively .",
    "events that have a minimum @xmath75 are considered pseudo - reconstructed ( `` pseudo '' is used because this method is only for continuum suppression , and we are not concerned that the parent @xmath42 reconstruction be exactly correct ) .",
    "if the minimum @xmath76 or not one combination of kaons and pions was found in the event , then the shape analysis described above is used .    for events that are pseudo - reconstructed , we calculate the angle between the thrust axis of the inferred signal b meson and the thrust axis of the rest of the event @xmath77 .",
    "events that are in actuality continuum typically have @xmath78 peaked at 1 , while signal events have a flat distribution . to get the most discriminating power , we combine @xmath79 and @xmath80 from the pseudo - reconstruction and @xmath61 from the shape neural network into a new variable @xmath81 using another neural network . as with @xmath61",
    ", the distribution of @xmath81 tends towards @xmath63 for signal events and @xmath62 for continuum . while this combined method is 10% efficient for signal , it reduces the continuum background by an additional factor of four over the shape method alone .",
    "we then weight each event according to its value of @xmath81 if it is pseudo - reconstructed or @xmath61 if not .",
    "the weighting scheme@xcite is designed so that the weighted yield is equivalent to the event yield in the absence of continuum backgrounds .",
    "this procedure gives the smallest statistical uncertainty on this background subtracted yield .",
    "note that there are non - continuum backgrounds discussed below , but these are small compared to continuum .",
    "the continuum background remaining after the suppression efforts is determined from off - resonance data .",
    "@xmath54 backgrounds are dominated by @xmath82 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) though @xmath85 and @xmath86 may have a small contribution .",
    "we estimate the @xmath87 backgrounds with monte carlo ( mc ) , but correct the @xmath49 and @xmath50 momentum spectra for any differences between data and mc . we obtain the momenta spectra from data by treating @xmath49 s and @xmath50 s as if they were photons and follow the same analysis procedure using weights described above .",
    "thus , the mc is used only for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 veto efficiencies and for any other small @xmath54 backgrounds not originating from missing a @xmath88 daughter from a @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "the weighted yields from 3.1  fb@xmath89 of on - resonance data plotted with respect to photon energy are shown in fig .  1 , with all of the backgrounds shown in ( a ) and the background subtracted weighted yield , which is the signal , shown in ( b ) .",
    "1.6  fb@xmath89 of off - resonance data were used for the continuum subtraction . the expected spectrum for @xmath3 from a spectator model",
    "is also shown in ( b ) . in the region of interest ( @xmath43  gev )",
    "we measure @xmath90 on - resonance weighted events , @xmath91 scaled off - resonance weighted events , and estimate the @xmath54 background to be 20.6 weighted events ( all uncertainties statistical ) . applying the @xmath49 and @xmath50 corrections to the estimate ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 weighted events respectively ) ,",
    "we derive the weighted , background - subtracted yield of @xmath94 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic .    for a typical sample of mc @xmath0 events ,",
    "approximately 50% pass all analysis requirements and of these , 40% are pseudo - reconstructed ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "but since we use weighted events for the signal yield , we need a weighted efficiency ; the sum of weights passing all requirements . because of our definition of weights",
    ", the weighted efficiency tends to be smaller than the efficiencies stated above . to model the signal , we use the spectator model of ali and greub@xcite , which includes gluon bremsstrahlung and other higher order radiative effects .",
    "details of mc production and parameters used are given in ref  @xcite .",
    "the weighed efficiency is @xmath96 , where the first uncertainty is due to spectator model inputs , the second due to recoil system hadronization , the third due to uncertainty in the production ratio of neutral and charged @xmath42 meson pairs , and the last to detector modeling .",
    "the weighted efficiency is combined with the background subtracted weighted yield to give the inclusive branching fraction of @xmath3 as @xmath97 , where the uncertainties are statistical , systematic and for model dependence respectively .",
    "our results are in agreement with the standard model prediction . conservatively allowing for the systematic uncertainty , we find that the branching fraction must be between @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( each limit at 95% cl ) .",
    "the sm predicts no cp asymmetry in @xmath0 decays , but some recent theoretical work@xcite suggests that non - sm physics may significantly contribute to a cp asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , if new physics has a weak phase difference near 90@xmath100 with respect to the sm and the strong phase is non - zero , the new physics would only slightly alter the @xmath0 inclusive branching ratio , but could produce a large effect in the asymmetry . since we can reuse much of the machinery from the branching fraction measurement",
    ", a search for cp asymmetry is an obvious extension to the @xmath101 analysis .",
    "the pseudo - reconstruction procedure described above is used to tag the @xmath45 quark flavor ( @xmath45 or @xmath102 ) , because it determines the particles decayed from the signal @xmath42 meson .",
    "but since the pseudo - reconstruction was designed for continuum suppression , we must determine how often it reconstructs the @xmath45 flavor correctly .",
    "if a signal @xmath42 meson decays to a neutral kaon and overall neutral pions ( _ e.g. _ @xmath103 ) , then we can not determine the @xmath45 flavor from pseudo - reconstruction .",
    "but for the majority of cases where the @xmath45 flavor is determinable , it can be deduced by the charge of the kaon , or the sum pion charge if the kaon is neutral . from mc",
    ", we estimate the probability of reconstructing the incorrect @xmath45 flavor when the @xmath45 flavor is determinable to be @xmath104 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty includes a combination of mc statistics and uncertainties derived from varying spectator model inputs to the mc and varying the ratio of charged to neutral @xmath42 meson decays .",
    "we also take into account the probability of tagging the @xmath45 flavor when it should be indeterminable and vice  versa , though these effects are small and will not be discussed further here .",
    "the asymmetry we measure is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the weighted yield tagged as @xmath45 quarks from pseudo - reconstruction and determinable as such , and @xmath107 is similarly the weighted yield tagged as @xmath102 . from the misreconstruction rates described above , we apply a multiplicative correction factor of @xmath108 to the asymmetry . in our misreconstruction determination , we assumed that the rate of mistagging a @xmath45 as a @xmath102 was the same as mistagging a @xmath102 as a @xmath45 .",
    "initial studies lead us to apply a conservative additive systematic error on the asymmetry of 5% to account for unequal mistagging rates , though we observe no measurable asymmetry in the off - resonance data and other control samples .    using the weighted yield from pseudo - reconstructed events with photons within @xmath109",
    ", we observe @xmath110 weights reconstructed as @xmath45 quarks and @xmath111 weights reconstructed as @xmath102 quarks ( uncertainties are statistical only ) , leading to a raw asymmetry measurement of @xmath112 . applying the correction factors , we obtain our preliminary cp asymmetry measurement in @xmath3 decays : @xmath113 , where the first number is the central value , the second is the statistical uncertainty , the third is the additive systematic described above , and the multiplicative factor is from the uncertainty on the mistagging rate correction . within the uncertainties , we measure no cp asymmetry . from this result , we derive 90% cl limits on the cp asymmetry ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath114 @xmath5 @xmath115 .",
    "we presented cleo s preliminary results on the @xmath116 branching ratio and the cp asymmetry in @xmath116 decays with approximately 3.1  fb@xmath89 of on - resonance data .",
    "cleo has since accumulated a total of 10  fb@xmath89 of on - resonance data .",
    "work is underway to determine the @xmath116 inclusive branching fraction and cp asymmetry with all of the data .",
    "we are also exploring extending both @xmath0 analyses by tagging the @xmath45 flavor with a lepton from the other @xmath42 meson in the event it undergoes semileptonic decay .",
    "this procedure offers further continuum suppression and may improve the asymmetry measurement by allowing the use of events where the @xmath45 flavor is undeterminable by pseudo - reconstruction .",
