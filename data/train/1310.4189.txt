    "near - equiatomic niti shape memory alloys ( smas ) belong to the most successful shape memory materials currently used in applications @xcite .",
    "their excellent functional and structural properties are based on a good mechanical strength , oxidation and corrosion resistance and reliable shape memory behavior @xcite .",
    "all the important shape memory effects ( the one - way effect , the two - way effect and pseudoelasticity ) are primarily associated with the martensitic transformation @xcite .",
    "the martensitic transformation converts the high temperature parent b2-austenite phase ( cscl - type ordered cubic lattice ) into the `` soft '' martensite r - phase ( @xmath3 trigonal lattice ) , and further into the low temperature martensite b19-phase ( @xmath4 monoclinic lattice ) .",
    "the intermetallic niti b2-phase exhibits some solubility for ni that increases with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "temperatures of martensitic phase transitions ( ptts ) are strongly dependent on the alloy composition and the impurity content @xcite .",
    "varying the nickel content in ni - rich niti sma from 50 to @xmath5 allows changing the ptts by more than @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ptts can be controlled by the concentration of nickel and thus tailored for a specific application .",
    "@xcite first provided evidence that variations in heat treatment environments may result in considerable changes of ptts in subsequent martensitic transformations .",
    "they pointed out that the solution annealing is the critical step as far as the impact of the heat treatment atmosphere on the transformation path is concerned .",
    "the path of the martensitic phase transition was shown to change once oxygen was a part of a residual gas during the heat treatment . in order to explain the observed effects , @xcite and recently also @xcite suggested a link between the precipitation of the ni@xmath7ti@xmath8 phase and the composition of the heat treatment atmosphere . while the scenario proposed by @xcite focused on the role of the residual oxygen , some other gaseous components , that may have contributed to the overall pressure of residual gasses and thus to the varying ptts , were not taken into account .",
    "this is rather surprising since numerous studies showed that other gasses , like e.g. hydrogen , may result in similar effects .",
    "many experimental and theoretical studies explored various aspects of the interactions between environments containing hydrogen and niti - based intermetallics , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "mazzolai and co - workers investigated and reported important parameters describing solubility and diffusion of interstitial hydrogen in the bulk niti smas @xcite . furthermore , the same research team applied advanced mechanical spectroscopy techniques @xcite in order to characterize interactions of interstitial hydrogen with dislocations , internal interfaces involved in martensitic transformations ( mts ) , such as twin boundaries and moving parent - product interface .",
    "a prospective strain - glass hypothesis has also been tested  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , with respect to the objectives of the present study , the internal friction experiments provided a clear evidence that a relaxation peak caused by interactions between hydrogen atoms and the austenite - martensite interface is suppressed for hydrogen concentrations higher than @xmath9 .",
    "this experimental result can only be rationalized assuming that higher hydrogen concentrations effectively inhibit the overall b2@xmath0r@xmath0b19 transformation process .",
    "this result received confirmations from both , ( i ) independent differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) experiments @xcite and ( ii ) _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite . in passing we",
    "note that the decay of b2@xmath0r@xmath0b19 mt due to the increasing hydrogen content exhibits some similarity to the suppression of the same transformation by increasing dislocation density during thermal transformation cycles @xcite .    @xcite used dft calculations to study bulk and surface diffusion of h in niti . in their calculations ,",
    "octahedral interstitial positions yielded the lowest energy states .",
    "@xcite studied nitih@xmath10 using the _ ab initio _ tight - binding method and considered also the octahedral interstitial positions with 4 ti and 2 ni nearest neighbors in order to form the hydride phases . on the other hand , the md based study of @xcite favors h atoms being placed in tetrahedral rather than in octahedral sites . moreover ,",
    "it is not clear what impact the local relaxations may have on the site occupation of the h atoms .",
    "hence , the aim of this study is to further explore the stability of point defects , such as h , he , and ar interstitials or ni(ti ) or ti(ni ) anti - sites , in the nearly equiatomic niti alloys , and to study their impact on the martensitic transformation process .",
    "we employ a state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ modeling procedure based on the density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "the present study focuses mainly on the austenite b2 phase , however , we also discuss briefly the stability of interstitials in the martensite b19 phase . table  [ tab : lattice ] summarizes the structural parameters taken from our previous study  @xcite that were adopted in the present work .",
    ".lattice parameters used in this study ( taken from  @xcite ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : inclinations ]    the structural similarity between b2 and b19 phases induced by h interstitials , can also be documented using the inclination angle @xmath11 ( introduced in section  [ sec : relaxation ] ) between the h  ni direction and the plane containing ti atoms .",
    "the results angles @xmath11 calculated for several configurations are summarized in table  [ tab : inclinations ] . as compared to the fully relaxed hydrogen - free b2 and b19 lattices , the relaxation of hydrogen from the b2 tetrahedral b - sites to the non - symmetrical sites ( fig .",
    "3b ) tends to decrease the inclination from 90@xmath12 down to 87.3@xmath12 while the opposite trend is observed for the b19 phase where the inclination grows from 81.7@xmath12 to 82.5@xmath12 .",
    "consequently , the h interstitial locally smears out ( to a certain extent ) the structural differences between the austenite b2 and martensite b19 phases . a similar effect is also obtained for another starting configuration where the h atom is situated in the octahedral position c in the b2 phase . here , however , the initial positions of the 4 ti and 2 ni atoms are slightly shifted along the @xmath13 $ ] directions before the structural relaxation takes place",
    ". we refer to this case as the shuffled c octahedral configuration .    the structural relaxation of the h atom in the shuffled octahedral interstitial site yields energy and geometry comparable with the case when starting configuration is represented by the tetrahedral coordination . however , unlike in the case of the non - symmetrical site ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : loc_neighbourhood]b ) , the two ni and one h atoms fall on a straight line for the shuffled octahedral geometry .",
    "thus , the shuffled c octahedral position resembles the b19 structure even better than the relaxed tetrahedral b positions .",
    "similar mechanism has been recently explored by @xcite in oxygen doped @xmath14-ti alloys .",
    "quantum - mechanical calculations were performed to study interstitials and anti - site point defects in niti phases . using the _ ab initio _ techniques ,",
    "we show that a slight ni - rich off - stoichiometry of the b2 niti phase is energetically favorable when it is realized by the ni(ti ) anti - site defects . regarding interstitials solutes ,",
    "our results clearly show that h atoms have a strong impact on the martensitic phase transformation in niti by altering the mutual thermodynamic stability of the high - temperature cubic and the low - temperature low - symmetry phase of niti .",
    "hydrogen atoms are predicted to form stable interstitial defects , unlike he and ar atoms .",
    "this opens a possibility to use mixtures of hydrogen and the two inert gases in annealing experiments in which effects of controlled h partial pressure on the subsequent martensitic transformations are investigated .",
    "hydrogen atoms preferably occupy non - symmetrical interstitial positions , similar to the octahedral site c with 4 ti and 2 ni nearest neighbors .",
    "characteristics of the local lattice distortions around the h interstitial defects in the b2 and b19 phases as well as a decreasing difference in the corresponding b2 and b19 total energies are in line with the extended stability of the b2 phase observed in the martensitic transformation experiments . in conclusion , our study provides insights into some fundamental processes governing martensitic transformation in niti exposed to realistic conditions such as gaseous atmospheres .",
