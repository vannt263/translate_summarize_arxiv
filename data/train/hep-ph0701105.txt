    "gauge - boson pair - production in vbf is of particular importance , as this reaction gives access to the scattering of longitudinally polarized vector bosons via the subprocess @xmath9 and is therefore intimately related to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( here @xmath10 refers to a @xmath11 or a @xmath12 boson ) .",

    "going beyond the ewa , a full tree - level calculation of @xmath19 processes , including @xmath18 and @xmath12 leptonic decay correlations , has been presented in  @xcite and in turn been applied to the investigation of strongly - interacting gauge - boson systems in ref .",

    "their use for diagrams of the same topology but with differences in quark propagators allows us to organize the calculation in a modular and efficient way .",
    "building blocks that agree in several diagrams are computed only once per phase - space point rather than separately for each graph .",
    "furthermore , a future implementation of new - physics effects in the bosonic / leptonic sector is straightforward in this framework .",
    "the partonic matrix elements for @xmath39 are evaluated in complete analogy to the @xmath0 channel .",
    "they give rise to new leptonic tensors for the sub - amplitudes @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    in either case , contributions from anti - quark initiated processes such as @xmath43 , obtained by crossing the above diagrams , are fully taken into account .",
    "however , graphs comprising vector - boson exchange in the @xmath22-channel with subsequent decay into a pair of jets are neglected throughout , as they are strongly suppressed in the phase - space regions where vbf can be observed experimentally . for identical - flavor combinations , besides @xmath20-channel also @xmath44-channel exchange diagrams arise . after the application of typical vbf cuts , the interference of @xmath20- and @xmath44-channel contributions becomes negligible @xcite and is therefore disregarded in our calculation .",
    "the calculation of nlo qcd corrections to ew  @xmath45 and @xmath46 production via vbf is based on the dipole subtraction formalism , in the version proposed by catani and seymour  @xcite . since the qcd structure of these reactions is identical to the related case of higgs production in vbf , the counter - terms are of the same form and can be readily adapted from ref .",
    "the real - emission contributions are computed in analogy to the lo matrix elements discussed above .",
    "in addition to quark and anti - quark initiated processes with extra gluon emission , such as @xmath47 , channels with a gluon in the initial state ( e.g.  @xmath48 ) have to be considered .",
    "the virtual contributions , obtained from the interference of one - loop diagrams with the born amplitude , are computed in the dimensional reduction scheme  @xcite in @xmath49 space - time dimensions .",
    "they include self - energy , triangle , box and pentagon corrections on either the upper or the lower quark line .",
    "contributions from graphs with gluons attached to both the upper and lower quark lines vanish at order @xmath50 , within our approximations , due to color conservation .",

    "special care has to be taken in the numerical evaluation of the remainder , @xmath58 , which can be computed in @xmath60 dimensions .",
    "we have calculated the two- , three- , and four - point tensor integrals contributing to @xmath58 by a passarino - veltman reduction procedure  @xcite , which is stable in the phase space regions covered by vbf - type reactions . for pentagon contributions , however , this technique gives rise to numerical instabilities , if kinematical invariants , such as the gram determinant , become small .",
    "we have therefore resorted to the reduction scheme proposed by denner and dittmaier for the tensor reduction of pentagon integrals  @xcite . in order to tag remaining numerical instabilities of the pentagon contributions , we check ward identities between pentagon and box graphs for each pentagon contribution .",
    "the fraction of events for which numerical instabilities lead to violations exceeding 10% can be brought down to the permille - level .",
    "the respective phase - space points are disregarded for the calculation of the finite parts of the pentagon contributions and the remaining pentagon part is compensated for this loss . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that this gauge check procedure ensures stable results for the virtual corrections , while the error induced by the approximation is far below the numerical accuracy of our monte carlo program .",
    "in addition to the stability tests for the pentagon diagrams , we have performed extensive checks for the lo and the real - emission amplitudes as well as for the total cross sections obtained with our parton - level monte carlo program .",
    "we have compared the born amplitude and the real - emission diagrams with the fully automatically generated results provided by madgraph  @xcite and found complete agreement .",
    "the real - emission contributions are qcd gauge invariant . finally , our total lo cross sections for ew @xmath61 and @xmath62 production with a minimal set of cuts agree with the respective results obtained by madevent .",
    "the cross - section contributions discussed above have been implemented in fully - flexible parton - level monte carlo programs for ew @xmath45 and @xmath46 production at nlo qcd accuracy in the vbfnlo framework that has been developed for the study of ew @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and slepton pair production  @xcite .",

    "in fact , using the scattering @xmath68 as a template , and referring to the topologies illustrated in figs .  [",
