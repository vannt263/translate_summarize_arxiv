    "these proceedings report results on merging massive black - hole binaries ( mbhbs ) obtained by the lisa parameter estimation ( lisape ) taskforce .",
    "the lisape taskforce was established at the september , 2007 , lisa international science team ( list ) meeting at estec , under the auspices of the list s working group 1b ( data analysis ) .",
    "the lisape taskforce was charged with developing a set of vetted tools for quickly estimating lisa s science reach for various mission configurations and gravitational - wave ( gw ) sources .",
    "the initial impetus for creating our taskforce arose because several research groups had independently written codes to calculate lisa s capabilities to extract the parameters of mbhbs @xcite , but these groups published results appeared on their face to be discrepant .",
    "however , the various groups also used somewhat different approximations in their signal models , as well as somewhat different assumptions for the lisa noise curve ( unfortunately , there has never been an `` official '' lisa noise curve ) . therefore it was unclear whether the differing results simply reflected these different assumptions , or whether they were due to bugs in one or more codes .",
    "the taskforce s first goal was to resolve that question .",
    "as described in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] , it turned out that there were no bugs : the differing results were primarily due to using different noise curves , and especially different low - frequency cut - offs .",
    "the second goal was to arrive at vetted parameter - estimation codes that the lisa project could safely use in its work , e.g. , in helping set lisa s sensitivity requirements , as set forth in the evolving lisa science requirements document  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the taskforce wanted to develop a set of models for the distribution of mbhb events in the universe : event rates as a function of the black - hole masses , spins , and redshift , based on well - motivated assumptions regarding the birth and growth history of massive black holes in the universe .",
    "the goal was to generate realistic source distributions , which we could `` feed '' to our vetted parameter - estimation codes in monte carlo fashion , arriving at realistic ensembles of lisa observations and associated parameter - estimation accuracies .",
    "our hope is that in the future other lisa researchers will use these same mbhb ensembles when evaluating lisa science performance , so that different researchers will be comparing `` apples to apples '' .    of course , today our ignorance concerning mbhb birth and growth is rather humbling @xcite .",
    "it therefore behooves us to consider a range of plausible assumptions . in the end ,",
    "the taskforce settled on four representative source distributions , constructed from four merger tree models .",
    "the four merger - tree models arise from two choices for astrophysical inputs : ( 1 ) whether the masses of the inital `` seed '' black holes are small or large , and ( 2 ) whether accretion is efficient or inefficient at spinning up the massive black holes .",
    "many more models could of course be developed , but the taskforce felt that these four do very broadly sample the range of possibilities , and so give useful insight into how much lisa s science reach depends on the distribution of mbhbs in the universe .",
    "the organization and procedures of the lisape taskforce were modelled on those of the quite successful mock lisa data challenge ( mldc ) taskforce ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "membership is open , we have group telecons roughly every two weeks , and the telecon minutes and other taskforce documents are posted on our wiki :    http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/dokuwiki/lisape:home    it turned out that the creation of our taskforce was quite timely , since by may , 2008 , we were in a position to contribute significantly to a `` descope exercise '' that the lisa project carried out in that month at nasa s behest .",
    "the results of that exercise are summarized in r. stebbins s contribution to this volume .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ merger ] we describe the four merger - tree models that we use , and the underlying astrophysical assumptions . in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] we describe the inter - code checks that we did to validate our parameter - estimation codes .",
    "all these codes calculate expected parameter uncertainties via the fisher - matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "such results are accurate only up to corrections of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "however they are much faster to implement than more accurate markov chain monte carlo methods , and so more suitable for exploration of a large parameter space . for our results , presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we used the parameter - estimation code developed by the montana / mit group , since their model waveforms already incorporated both higher harmonics and spin - orbital precession effects . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions and discuss briefly the planned future work of the lisape taskforce .",
    "the cosmological evolution of massive black holes can be determined by following the merger history of dark - matter halos and of the associated black holes by cosmological monte carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a @xmath2cdm cosmology ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the simulations provide the masses , redshifts and spins of merging black holes .",
    "two important sources of uncertainty in merger - tree models of black - hole formation are ( i ) the formation mechanism and mass of the first `` seed '' black holes , and ( ii ) the details of how accretion causes black holes to grow in time ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "to bracket these uncertainties we focused on four representative models .    as a representative model with `` light '' black - hole seeds we considered the volonteri - haardt - madau ( vhm ) scenario  @xcite , where light seed black holes of @xmath7 few hundred @xmath8 are produced as remnants of metal - free stars at redshift @xmath9 . in an alternative scenario ,",
    "`` heavy '' seeds with @xmath10 are formed as the end - product of dynamical instabilities arising in massive gaseous protogalactic disks in the redshift range @xmath11 . to allow for the possibility of heavy seeds",
    ", we considered a variant of this scenario proposed by begelman , volonteri and rees ( @xcite , henceforth bvr ) . both models ( light and heavy seeds )",
    "can reproduce the agn optical luminosity function in the redshift range @xmath12 , but they result in different coalescence rates of mbhbs and hence in different gw backgrounds  @xcite . to bracket uncertainties in the growth of black holes by accretion , in both the `` light seed '' ( vhm ) and `` heavy seed '' ( bvr ) cases we considered two different accretion models .",
    "we adopted either the standard `` prolonged accretion '' scenario , where accretion of material with constant angular momentum axis rapidly spins up the holes  @xcite , or a `` chaotic accretion '' scenario  @xcite , where accretion always proceeds via very small and short episodes , caused by fragmentation of the accretion disc where it becomes self - gravitating .",
    "since counter - rotating material spins black holes down more efficiently than co - rotating material spins them up , and it is quite unlikely for mergers to produce rapidly spinning holes @xcite , the chaotic accretion scenario implies that black - hole spins are typically rather small  @xcite .",
    "for all four models ( with heavy / light seeds and efficient / chaotic accretion ) , the spin resulting from individual merger events was determined using a semianalytical fitting formula based on numerical relativity simulations of the merger process  @xcite .",
    "this formula provides the modulus of the final spin @xmath13 given the binary s mass ratio @xmath14 and the initial spins @xmath15 @xmath16 : @xmath17 .",
    "the three angles @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where a hat denotes unit vectors , describe the orientation of the initial spins relative to the binary s orbital angular momentum @xmath21 ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the merger - tree simulations do not provide information on the source position in the sky and on the orientation of the binary s angular momentum .",
    "however , by averaging over different merger trees we can reasonably assume that all angles are isotropically distributed in the sky .",
    "we further assume that spin alignment is not efficient , so that the spin directions at merger are isotropically distributed",
    ". this assumption may be violated if mergers commonly occur in gas - rich environments , and if the torque exerted by the gas is efficient in producing alignment of the black hole s angular momenta , as suggested in  @xcite ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "a merger tree traces the merger history that leads to a @xmath22 dark - matter halo in a hierarchical cosmology . for each formation scenario ,",
    "our sample is based on @xmath23 different halo masses  @xcite that span the masses of interest ( from a dwarf galaxy to a cluster of galaxies ) .",
    "each merger tree is characterized by the mass of the parent halo at @xmath22 and its press - schechter weight @xmath24 @xmath25 @xcite , which is used to scale the results to the ( comoving ) number density of sources .",
    "furthermore , for each halo mass a different number @xmath26 of realizations of its merger history have been performed , to take into account cosmic variance .",
    "typically , large - mass halos have a smaller press - schechter weight ( inherent in the adopted cosmological model ) and a smaller number of realizations ( due to computational burden ) .    for each tree @xmath27 we produced data files listing black - hole masses , spins and redshifts corresponding to `` branches '' of the tree where a merger event occurs .",
    "all quantities in these files are measured in the source frame , at variance with the convention used in the mldc ( recall that @xmath28 ) . including all merger trees and all realizations of each merger tree , in a typical model such as vhm we have at least @xmath29 merging events , but many of these events",
    "will _ not _ be detectable by lisa .",
    "once we choose a criterion to select detectable binaries , e.g. by requiring the snr to be larger than some threshold value @xmath30 in a one - year observation time , the number of events at a given redshift @xmath31 per comoving volume is n_com(z)= _ k=1^n_tree _ j=1^n_mergers^(k ) , where @xmath32 is the heaviside step function , and in practice we choose @xmath33 . the number of observable events at @xmath22 per unit time and redshift is then given by [ dndzdt ] = 4c n_com(z)^2 , where @xmath34 is the luminosity distance @xcite .",
    "the importance to gw astronomy of higher - harmonic corrections to post - newtonian ( pn ) waveforms for massive black - hole inspirals has been recognized long ago @xcite , but recently there have been several papers trying to quantify this effect more precisely  @xcite . though the qualitative conclusions of all these papers were similar , the quantitative estimates were different .",
    "this has to do with differences in the nature of waveforms used in the analysis ( time versus frequency domain ) , the different noise power spectral densities ( psds ) employed and different ways of truncating the pn waveforms .",
    "the main goal of the exercise presented in this section is to bring together the results of various groups and compare them using common values for the masses , the duration of the signal in the lisa band , the noise psd and the lower frequency cut - off of the detector .    to this end",
    "it was decided that each group would analyze four different non - spinning mbhb sources .",
    "the sources were described by the following parameters : individual masses @xmath35 , co - latitude and longitude @xmath36 , the polarization and inclination angles @xmath37 or the orbital angular momentum variables @xmath38 , the luminosity distance @xmath34 , the orbital phase at coalescence @xmath39 and the instant of coalescence @xmath40 .",
    "the given parameter sets were @xmath41 for case 1 , and @xmath42 @xmath43 for case 2 .",
    "note that all angular variables are given in radians , and that the chosen luminosity distance corresponds to a redshift @xmath44 .",
    "it was decided that each group would use waveforms which were correct to 2pn order in both amplitude and phase , and for each source we assumed one year of data .",
    "the time of coalescence is @xmath45 year in cases 1a and 2a ; in cases 1b and 2b , @xmath46 years , so that the merger occurs after the end of the data set .",
    "we assumed common mldc  @xcite conventions for the angles , and we adopted a common list of physical constants .",
    "more importantly , all groups agreed to use the noise curve that was used in the second round of the mldc @xcite .",
    "there are two components to the noise model : instrumental noise ( @xmath47 ) and confusion noise from the galactic foreground ( @xmath48 ) . for our comparison exercise ,",
    "the ( sky - averaged ) instrumental noise is    @xmath49 s_p +   \\left[1+\\left({\\frac{10^{-4}}{f}}\\right)^2\\right ] \\frac{4 s_a}{(2 \\pi f)^4 }    \\right\\ } \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is in hz , @xmath51  m is the armlength , @xmath52 m@xmath53 hz@xmath4 is the ( white ) position noise level , @xmath54 m@xmath53  s@xmath55 hz@xmath4 is the white acceleration noise level ( assumed equal to the red acceleration noise level ) and @xmath56 is the lisa arm transfer frequency . note that the term @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ noise - comparisons ] ) is not strictly due to an increase in shot noise at high - frequency .",
    "rather lisa s response to gws falls rapidly for @xmath58 , and in the low - frequency approximation adopted in our parameter estimation codes , this effect is typically accounted for by adjusting the noise curve in this fashion .",
    "the galactic confusion noise is estimated by direct simulation .",
    "a nelemans _ et al . _",
    "@xcite population synthesis code was used to produce a catalog of galactic binaries with periods shorter than @xmath59 seconds .",
    "the catalog contained @xmath60 detached binaries and @xmath61 interacting binaries .",
    "the lisa response to this foreground was computed @xcite and added to simulated instrument noise . a bayesian model selection technique",
    "was then used to determine which systems could be individually identified and regressed from the data @xcite . the residual was then smoothed using a savitzky - golay smoothing filter to produce an estimate for the galactic confusion noise . the confusion noise used in the comparisons",
    "is given by a piecewise fit to the residual for a two - year nominal lifetime without interacting binaries :    @xmath62    where @xmath50 is in hz . while there were differences between the way waveforms",
    "were treated , the main difference between the various groups was the analytical noise curve that was used . once a common noise curve was agreed upon",
    ", most of the disagreement between groups disappeared . a final tidying up of the slight disagreements between waveform models produced a concrete verification of the results .    in the next few sections",
    ", we outline the different waveform approximations that were used .",
    "two groups used time - domain waveforms , and two groups used frequency - domain waveforms . to begin with",
    ", it seemed reasonable to make comparisons between either time - domain or frequency - domain based codes .",

    "lisa will detect quite a good fraction of the mergers which occur in the universe : almost all mergers will be detected in large - seed scenarios , and nearly half of all mergers in small - seed scenarios .",

    "therefore , an accuracy in @xmath34 of about 1% is needed if we want our standard sirens to be limited only by lensing , and not by the random errors due to lisa s instrumental noise . the temporal coincidence with",
    "any prompt electromagnetic counterpart may offer the best chance of identifying a unique host galaxy , especially if we can locate the source within one ( or a few ) square degrees @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : pe ] clearly shows that with the merger - tree models and gravitational waveforms used in this study , both the baseline design and the 6-link model have the potential for precision cosmology .",
    "however , the 6-link configuration performs significantly better than the baseline design . with the 6-link configuration lisa can get the luminosity distance to within 10% for the majority of detectable events .",
    "this is not really surprising , since the luminosity distance does not have a strong correlation with the phasing parameters and our detection threshold is @xmath33 .",
    "however , only a fourth to half of all events can be resolved within a 10 deg@xmath53 error box .",
    "once an event has a good sky resolution it will also have a good accuracy in @xmath34 , as evidenced by the similarity of the numbers in columns 5 and 6 : this is due to the high correlation between luminosity distance and angular parameters of the source ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of events that can be localized to within 1 deg@xmath53 is far smaller .",
    "a few events can be localized to such accuracy using one - year observations and the 6-link noise curve , while the statistics are too low to determine if events could be localized to such accuracy with the baseline design . finally , while we have considered only 6-link and 4-link lisa configurations , it is possible that lisa will operate with 5 links for some substantial time .",
    "the important point is that for mbhb mergers , lisa s sensitivity and parameter extraction accuracy with 5 links should be nearly as good as with 6 @xcite .",
    "therefore it is quite plausible that @xmath113 event per year could have angular resolution and accuracy in luminosity distance good enough to measure the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we compared four largely independent codes for calculating lisa s parameter - estimation capabilities .",
    "all codes are based on the fisher - matrix approximation , but in the past they used somewhat different signal models , source parametrizations and noise curves .",
    "we showed that once these differences are removed , the four codes give results in extremely close agreement with each other .    using a code that includes both spin precession and higher harmonics in the gw signal , we presented a preliminary exploration of lisa s ability to do precision cosmology using four different merger - tree models and two different sensitivity curves . for the merger history of galaxies we used either `` small '' seed black holes ( @xmath114 ) or `` large '' seeds ( @xmath115 ) . in each case",
    "we adopted two different accretion scenarios ( efficient or chaotic accretion ) , thereby giving us four models for the birth , growth and spin evolution of massive black holes .",
    "we then employed a carefully tested tool to compute the parameter accuracies for events that lisa can detect with an ( amplitude ) snr of at least 10 .",
    "our study shows that lisa has good potential for carrying out precision cosmology .",
    "there will be about 20 sources with a modest distance measurement ( to within 10 % ) and about 10 sources with a modest sky resolution ( 10 deg@xmath53 ) .",
    "even more interestingly , each year lisa may observe a few sources with excellent sky resolution ( 1 deg@xmath53 ) and luminosity distance measurements ( to within 1% ) .",
    "such accuracies are good enough to measure the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath110 to within a percent , the dominant source of uncertainty being errors in the luminosity distance from weak lensing of gw events @xcite .",
    "the waveforms used in our study included important physical effects , such as high - order pn corrections in amplitude and phase and precessing spins .",
    "however our waveforms were incomplete in one respect : they did not include the merger and ringdown parts of the signal .",
    "future work will include ringdown either in a phenomenological way ( by estimating the final black hole s parameters from the inspiral parameters , and then using the ringdown measurement formalism developed in @xcite ) or by `` stitching '' pn inspiral waveforms to a set of numerical relativity waveforms . as shown recently by babak",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) the inclusion of the merger and ringdown signal is expected to improve parameter estimation in two ways : by enhancing the signal - to - noise ratio and by increasing the signal bandwidth .",
    "future studies will need to explore the contribution of merger and ringdown signals to detection rates and parameter - estimation accuracy .",
    "they should also explore a broader class of merger - tree models to get a more realistic evaluation of lisa s ability to do precision cosmology .",
    "the lisape taskforce is presently developing tools similar to those described in this paper to explore measurement accuracies from extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) of compact objects into massive black holes .",
    "this work will be reported elsewhere .",
