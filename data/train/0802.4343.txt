    "the quantum antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is a quintessential example of frustrated quantum magnets and therefore has been a subject of intense research activities @xcite .",
    "the ground state of this model , however , has been highly controversial generating a number of competing proposals .",
    "recent proposals include a gapless spin liquid with dirac fermionic spinons @xcite , a gapped spin liquid with bosonic spinons @xcite , and the valence bond solid ( vbs ) with a 36-site unit cell structure @xcite .",
    "the identification of the ground state may be important to explain a series of recent experiments on herbertsmithites zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 @xcite , where spin-1/2 moments reside on the ideal kagome - lattice structure and interact with each other antiferromagnetically .",
    "it was found that the material remains paramagnetic down to 50 mk while the curie - weiss temperature is about 300 k @xcite .",
    "while this discovery is consistent with nonmagnetic ground states , the precise nature of the ground state still needs to be clarified by future experiments .",
    "recent theoretical studies reveal that the energy difference between various competing ground states is extremely small @xcite , which makes it quite difficult to theoretically determine the true ground state . at the same time , this implies that even a small perturbation to the ideal nearest - neighbor heisenberg model on the kagome lattice may result in completely different ground states .",
    "given that small perturbations such as the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction and impurities are indeed likely to be present in herbertsmithites @xcite , the identification of the true ground state in this material becomes a complex issue . in this context , it is crucial to make testable experimental predictions for various proposed ground states , which then can be used to determine the true nature of the nonmagnetic state discovered in herbertsmithites @xcite .     or @xmath3 .",
    "the dimers 2 , 5 , and 8 become bridges connecting perfect hexagons.,width=245 ]    in this paper , we focus on the valence bond solid ground state with a 36-site unit cell ( shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : vbspattern ] ) and compute spin - triplet excitation spectra by using bond opertor formalism .",
    "the triplet excitation spectra can be directly measured in future neutron scattering experiments when single crystals become available .",
    "the eighteen dimers in a 36-site unit cell can be categorized into two groups :  core \" dimers ( numbered @xmath4 in fig .  [ fig : vbspattern ] ) including a  pin - wheel \" structure at the center and  surrounding \" dimers ( numbered @xmath5 in fig .  [ fig : vbspattern ] ) including the honeycomb - lattice structure of  perfect hexagons \" .",
    "as shown later , triplet excitations in the core dimers are highly localized and have flat dispersions . on the other hand , triplet excitations in the surrounding dimers",
    "can develop a dispersion by hopping around perfect hexagons .",
    "triplet excitation spectra are obtained by using the fully self - consistent mean - field theory in the bond operator representation . as shown later ( see fig.[fig : dispersionquad ] and fig.[fig : dispersionquartic ] ) , the main feature of the triplet excitation spectra is that a large number of triplet modes are non - dispersive .",
    "the lowest triplet excitation is non - dispersive and degenerate with a dispersive mode at the zone center .",
    "away from the zone center , the lowest triplet is separated from two other flat modes by a small energy gap .",
    "it is expected that the triplet excitation energies at high symmetric points such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 may be useful for comparison to future neutron scattering experiments on single crystals .",
    "the mean - field energy of the ground state is @xmath8 which is not too bad for a nive mean - field theory when compared to @xmath9 obtained from exact diagonalization of a 36-site cluster @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lowest spin - triplet gap is rather high , namely @xmath10 , which is expected to be significantly reduced once quantum fluctuations are properly taken into account .",
    "it is shown later that the formation of two - triplet bound state can renormalize the lowest spin - triplet gap from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "while it is still larger than @xmath12 obtained from exact diagonalization of a 36-site cluster @xcite , it is certainly in the right direction .",
    "possible origins for the discrepancy are discussed later .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "bondoperator ] , physical motivations for studying the vbs state with a 36-site unit cell are provided . in this section , the bond operator representation is explained . in section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] , the bond operator mean - field theory is developed .",
    "results for the spin - triplet excitation spectra and quantum fluctuation effects are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude by making a direct comparison between the lowest spin - triplet excitation obtained from our theory and those from the spin liquid theories . in the spin liquid states , triplet excitations form a continuum .",
    "the lower bound of such continuum , or the threshold energy , is given by the convolution of spinon - antispinon excitation spectra .",
    "detailed measurement of the triplet spectra would be a key to the identification of the true ground state .",
    "in this section we discuss physical motivations for the valence bond solid ( vbs ) state with a 36-site unit cell structure .",
    "the vbs state with a 36-site unit cell was initially proposed by marston and zeng @xcite who envisioned the kagome lattice as a honeycomb - lattice arrangement of perfect hexagons composed of resonant spin singlets .",
    "some time later , nikolic and senthil @xcite provided an argument for the general validity of the 36-site vbs state in the kagome - lattice antiferromagnet by a duality mapping .",
    "the main idea of this work is that the original kagome - lattice antiferromagnetic model can be mapped to the fully frustrated ising model on the dual dice lattice with transverse fields . using a reasonable assumption about the magnitude of the transverse fields relative to the ising coupling parameter",
    ", it is shown that the honeycomb structure of perfect hexagons is likely to be the ground state . meanwhile , in a series expansion study by singh and huse @xcite , it has been shown that the ground state energy is minimized when perfect hexagons are connected to their neighbors through empty triangles sharing a singlet dimer bond which in turn implies the same honeycomb structure of perfect hexagons as discussed in earlier works .    here",
    "we provide an alternative viewpoint on the origin of the valence bond solid state .",
    "we begin by asking what state may be the most stable dimer covering configuration on the kagome lattice .",
    "we argue that the most stable configuration is the dimer covering which maximizes the number of  topologically perpendicular \" spin - singlet dimers .",
    "this argument is motivated by the exact ground state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice , where all dimers are mutually perpendicular to each other @xcite .",
    "we use the word  topologically perpendicular \" since two neighboring dimers have the identical spin exchange energy as those obtained in the shastry - sutherland lattice when a spin belonging to a given dimer shares a triangle with its neighboring dimer .",
    "it can be shown that the pinwheel structure at the core of the unit cell in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbspattern ] is the configuration maximizing the number of  topologically perpendicular \" dimers .",
    "the rest of the dimer covering falls into the honeycomb array of perfect hexagons .",
    "while the final conclusion is exactly the same as before , there is an additional advantage over the previous arguments .",
    "our point of view naturally leads to the fact that core dimers are decoupled from surrounding dimers . to see this , it is convenient to use a mathematical formalism which uses the spin - singlet degree of freedom as a natural building block of the vbs phase",
    ". the bond operator representation is such a formalism @xcite .",
    "let us consider two neighboring @xmath13 spins , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by four states which can be decomposed into a singlet state , @xmath16 , and three triplet state , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "then , singlet and triplet boson operators are introduced such that each of the above states can be created from the vacuum @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 to eliminate unphysical states from the enlarged hilbert space , the following constraint needs to be imposed on the bond - particle hilbert space : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and we adopt the summation convention for the repeated index hereafter unless mentioned otherwise .    constrained by this equation , the exact expressions for the spin operators can be written in terms of the bond operators .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the third rank antisymmetric tensor with @xmath27",
    ".    when neighboring dimers are  topologically perpendicular \" , spin - singlet contributions from both of the constituent spins of the neighboring dimer exactly cancel out .",
    "this cancellation can be seen in the bond operator representation of spin operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bond - ops ] ) where it is shown that a pair of the spin operators within the same dimer have the opposite sign in the parts containing spin singlets .",
    "this results in the hamiltonian with no dispersive quadratic part for core triplets , which eventually gives rise to nine - fold degenerate flat bands plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionquad ] and [ fig : dispersionquartic ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "this fact is completely consistent with conclusions from the series expansion studies @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the honeycomb lattice of perfect hexagons is a stable dimer covering maximizing the number of  topologically perpendicular \" dimers , which in turn naturally suggests decoupling of core dimers from surrounding ones .",
    "since the bond operator representation is a perfect theoretical framework for such situation , we use it to analyze the kagome - lattice antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "since we expect qualitatively different behaviors between core and surrounding dimers , we introduce a different set of parameters for their singlet condensate densities , @xmath28 = @xmath29 and chemical potentials , @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 denotes the position of the unit cell located at @xmath31 and @xmath32 indicates the dimer index inside the unit cell .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that the dynamics is different for the dimers within perfect hexagons ( the dimers 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbspattern ] ) and those bridging perfect hexagons ( the dimers 2 , 5 , 8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbspattern ] ) .",
    "therefore , we introduce @xmath33 , @xmath34 for nine core dimers , @xmath35 , @xmath36 for six surrounding dimers of perfect hexagons , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 for three bridging dimers connecting perfect hexagons . technical details of the bond operator analysis are provided in the next section .",
