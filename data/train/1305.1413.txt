    "since the discovery of the first exoplanets by @xcite and @xcite , hundreds of new exoplanets have been discovered , and thousands of exoplanet candidates have been identified using the _ kepler _ observatory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a substantial fraction of the known planets",
    "are part of a multi - planet system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite indicate that a large fraction of these exoplanet candidates are genuine , and that the majority of the planets in a multi - planet system orbit their host star in nearly the same plane ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "most stars , and therefore most planetary systems , are thought to form in star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although some may form in relatively isolated regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a certain fraction of these star clusters may survive for a long time , but many dissolve within 20 - 50  myr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "several studies have suggested that even own solar system may have formed in an open cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , argue that current observations do not rule out that the solar system may have formed in a massive , but short - lived , star cluster .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an extensive review on the birth environment of the solar system . in such dense stellar environments , dynamical encounters between stars",
    "are frequent and can perturb the orbit of binary stars and planetary system significantly .    as",
    "star clusters are the likely birth places of the majority of the planet - hosting stars in the solar neighbourhood , numerous exoplanet surveys have been carried out in open clusters and globular clusters , but their results have been disappointing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "very few or no close - in planets with orbital period range of @xmath5 days have been detected in 47  tucanae and @xmath6  centauri @xcite , the hyades @xcite , ngc6397 @xcite , ngc6791 @xcite , m37 @xcite , ngc6791 @xcite , ngc2158 @xcite ,",
    "ngc7789 @xcite , ngc1245 @xcite , and ngc7068 @xcite . however , a number of planets have been found in open clusters : @xcite and @xcite both report a planet in a wide orbit around a giant star .",
    "in addition , @xcite report the discovery of two hot jupiters in praesepe , making these the first hot jupiters to be detected orbiting a main sequence star in a star cluster .",
    "finally , protoplanetary disks have been detected in star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , hinting at planet formation .",
    "these observations demonstrate that planets can form in star clusters , but it leaves the question why so few have been discovered .",
    "the paucity of planets in star clusters may partially be explained by the suppression of planet formation in star clusters .",
    "jupiter - mass planets are less likely to form in the neighbourhood of massive stars in star clusters due to the evaporation of circumstellar disks by photo - evaporation @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite showed that stellar encounters reduce planet formation due to disk destruction , although @xcite find that encounters between circumstellar disks and other stars may actually enhance planet formation .",
    "after the formation process , a newly - formed planetary system and its cometary population remain prone to disruption by encountering stars during the lifetime of the star cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of the encounters is primarily determined by the local stellar density , the collisional cross section of the planetary system , and the timescale at which the system is exposed to external perturbations . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that planetary systems similar to our own solar systems are likely to survive in open clusters , but not in globular clusters .",
    "@xcite study star - planet systems in star cluster environments and derive dynamical cross - sections and the location of the hard - soft boundary for star - planet systems , showing that these systems are more prone to disruption than previously thought .",
    "flybys can cause immediate ejections , but can also trigger instabilities in multi - planet systems that can lead to the ejection of one or more planets millions of years after the encounter occurred @xcite . a systematic study on the evolution of single - planet systems in globular clusters",
    "was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they find that close - in planets are difficult to disrupt , but their eccentricities are excited by weak encounters , which may ultimately result in their migration as a result of tidal evolution .    given that most star clusters may initially have a cool virial state and a fractal structure",
    ", close encounters may be more frequent during the early phase of relaxation @xcite .",
    "a highly inclined companion could excite planets to high eccentricity orbits through the kozai mechanism @xcite as a result of secular interaction @xcite .",
    "studies on the secular instability of several isolated multi - planet systems caused by angular momentum deficit ( amd ) and mean motion resonance show that these non - circular and non - co - planar orbits generated by the perturbation with random resonances would be unstable @xcite .",
    "the evolution of compact multi - planet systems in star clusters , however , remains poorly understood , although previous studies have already indicated that the effect of planet - planet interactions may be at least as important as the effect of stellar flybys @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to model the evolution of these in star clusters using direct @xmath7-body simulations , because of the enormous range of temporal and spatial scales between individual planetary systems and their host star clusters .",
    "in addition , the number of weak stellar encounters is large and numerical errors in planetary systems are cumulative ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "previous studies have therefore often focused on single - planet systems , which can be modelled as perturbed two - body systems , or on planetary systems in low - mass , short - lived star clusters .    in this article we present monte carlo scattering experiments to study the evolution of multi - planet systems in dense stellar environments , modelling all encounters within @xmath8  au during the time a typical planetary system spends in a dense open cluster environment .",
    "we find that the effect of flybys is important for the evolution of a multi - planet system .",
    "interestingly , we demonstrate that the evolution of short - period planets is substantially affected by the presence of outer planets .",
    "the article is organised as follows : we describe the methods and assumptions in ",
    "[ section : method ] .",
    "the results and analysis are presented in   [ section : results ] , and finally we draw the conclusions in   [ section : conclusions ] and discuss our results in   [ section : discussion ] .",
    "under some circumstances it is possible to run full @xmath7-body simulations of dense star clusters with planetary systems . for single - planet systems , this is relatively easy , since two - body systems can be regularised .",
    "@xcite , for example , used this method for a comprehensive study on the dynamical evolution of single - planet systems in populous star clusters .",
    "the situation is substantially more complex for multi - planet systems .",
    "individual planetary motions require integration using time steps which are many orders of magnitude smaller than those used for the stellar dynamics .",
    "in addition , the integration errors in planetary systems are cumulative . as the secular behaviour of a multi - planet system is of utmost importance to its dynamical fate , it is currently impractical to use full @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "note that several attempts have been made to carry out such simulations with relatively low - mass star clusters and on shorter timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to study the evolution of multi - planet systems in dense clusters on long timescales , however , we need to resort to alternative techniques .",
    "we use a monte - carlo scattering approach to simulate the environment in which most of the planetary systems are born .",
    "we model the evolution of the newly generated planetary systems at high accuracy and attempt to reproduce their environments more realistically than in previous studies . instead of carrying out time - consuming , and for our purpose",
    "inaccurate , direct @xmath7-body simulations of star clusters with planetary systems , we focus only on individual planetary systems and their encountering stars , while ignoring the more or less homogeneous effect of other surrounding stars in the cluster .",
    "we first calculate the encounter rate for a typical star in an open cluster environment . based on the total number of stars that approach the planetary system within a distance of  1000  au during its lifetime in the star cluster , we let the encountering stars approach the planetary system one by one at a poissonian time interval , derived from the average encounter frequency .      we consider the evolution of planetary systems in open clusters similar to the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , which has roughly @xmath9 stars with a one dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath10  kms@xmath11   @xcite and a half - mass radius of @xmath12  pc . within the half - mass radius ,",
    "the average distance between two stars is approximately @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the star cluster is in virial equilibrium and ignore the effects of mass segregation and evaporation .",
    "the lifetime of an open cluster depends on the properties of the star cluster and its environment .",
    "open clusters dissolve within @xmath14 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and we therefore adopt a total integration time of 100  myr .",
    "the properties of the encountering stars are modelled by drawing ( i ) the relative velocity at infinity @xmath15 , ( ii ) the impact parameter @xmath16 , ( iii ) the mass @xmath17 of the encountering star , and ( iv ) the encounter rate @xmath18 from the distributions that are representative for open clusters . for simplicity , we assume in this study that these four parameter distributions are mutually independent , and independent of time .",
    "all encountering stars are initialised to approach from random directions .",
    "our choices for these four parameters , as well as several other environmental quantities are summarised in table  [ table : encounters ] .",
    "the masses @xmath17 of the encountering stars are drawn from the @xcite normal mass distribution , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the mass range @xmath22 .",
    "although more massive stars can cause substantial damage to planetary systems during their encounters , we ignore them since they are relatively rare and short - lived .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume that the mass of the encountering stars is uncorrelated with their impact parameter , their velocity at infinity , and time .",
    "in other words , we ignore the effects of mass segregation and stellar evolution .    the encounter velocities are derived from the velocity dispersion of the star cluster . for the @xcite model , its relation to the total mass @xmath23 and half - mass radius @xmath24 of the cluster",
    "is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the gravitational constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in our simulations we are interested in the distribution of velocity differences @xmath15 between two stars , which can be obtained from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , @xmath28 where the mean velocity difference between two stars is @xmath29  kms@xmath11 , and @xmath30 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "as all planets have masses much smaller than either of the two stars involved , the stars follow near - hyperbolic trajectories .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath31 between the two stars as a function of their separation @xmath32 can therefore be approximated with @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the combined mass the bodies involved .",
    "the hyperbolic orbit can be described using its impact parameter @xmath16 and its velocity at infinity @xmath15 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath16 is drawn from the distribution @xmath35 we only consider encounters with impact parameter @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the maximum impact parameter , and we ignore the effect of stars with an impact parameter larger than @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite have shown that the most important parameter that determines the effect of a stellar encounter on a planetary system is their distance of closest approach @xmath38 .",
    "its relation to the impact parameter @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath39 typical encounters have @xmath40 and @xmath41  kms@xmath11 .",
    "for these interactions , @xmath42  au corresponds to a distance of closest approach of @xmath43  au . in our simulations",
    "we ignore the weak perturbations induced by stars with @xmath44  au .    now that we have drawn @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 from their respective distributions",
    ", we can calculate the hyperbolic semi - major axis @xmath45 and the hyperbolic eccentricity @xmath46 where @xmath38 is the distance of closest approach .",
    "finally , the velocity at periastron @xmath47 is given by @xmath48    the encounter rate @xmath18 is calculated using @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the local stellar density , @xmath30 the velocity dispersion and @xmath51 the cross section of the encounter , which can be approximated with @xmath52 the time @xmath53 between two subsequent interactions is drawn from a poisson distribution @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the average time between two subsequent encounters . for the star cluster listed in table  [ table :",

    "[ table : encounters ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we study the evolution of multi - planet systems in dense stellar environments . in order to demonstrate the importance of multiplicity and planet - planet scattering in these systems , we carry out additional simulations in which we follow the evolution of single - planet systems in identical environments . in this experiment",
    "we carry out simulations in which the planetary orbits are as described in ",
    "[ section : initialconditions ] , but in this case only with for stars with a single planet .",
    "we use exactly the same properties of the encountering stars and encounter intervals , such that we are able to make a proper comparison .",
    "the results for the evolution of the single - planet systems are listed in table  [ table : singleplanet ] .",
    "the differences with those of the multi - planet systems ( table  [ table : multiplanet ] ) are obvious : planet - planet scattering is of great importance to the evolution of multi - planet systems . among the close - in planets in model  1 we observe many more escapers and collisions in the multi - planet case , with respect to the single - planet case .",
    "the differences are smaller for the outermost planets , as these are mostly affected by direct interactions with encountering stars .",
    "our data hints that outer planets have a slightly higher survival chance in multi - planet systems .",
    "one possible explanation for this is the interaction with the inner planetary system , which may exchange angular momentum with a strongly perturbed outer planet , which may mildly reduce its chances of escape .",
    "however , statistics should be improved in order to make a clear statement about this difference . in the case of the four solar system planets ( model  2 ) , a similar trend is observed .",
    "one important difference is that , although the evolution of the outer three planets is substantially affected by the multiplicity , the jupiters are unaffected .",
    "the reason for this is that the jupiters are much more massive than the other planets , and therefore relatively unaffected by planet - planet scattering .",
    "for this reason , the surviving fraction of jupiters is roughly @xmath58 , irrespective of whether other , lower - mass planets are present in the system .",
    "we have studied the evolution of planetary systems in star clusters similar to the onc over an evolutionary time of the order of @xmath59 years .",
    "we study two types of planetary systems in particular . in the first set of simulations ( model",
    "1 ) we study the effect of encounters between planetary systems consisting of five jupiter - mass planets in the semi - major axis range of @xmath60  au and single stars that approach these planetary systems within a distance less than @xmath8  au . in the second set of simulations , we consider systems similar to our own solar system , containing the sun , jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune .",
    "the interactions are integrated using the classical aarseth - mikkola chain integrator in regularised coordinates with high efficiency and accuracy . for the time interval between two subsequent interactions",
    "the mercury integration package is used to follow the internal secular evolution of the planetary systems .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .   in multi - planet systems in open star clusters , planets of all periods",
    "are either directly or indirectly affected by stellar encounters .",
    "the inner planetary orbits are affected as a result of interaction with perturbed outer planets",
    ". 2 .   for the equal - mass system ( model  1 ) ,",
    "the planets starting at @xmath61  au , approximately @xmath62 survives , while @xmath63 escapes , both in the single - planet and multi - planet cases . for those planets starting out at @xmath64",
    "au in a multi - planet system , approximately @xmath65 escapes , @xmath66 collides with the central star , and 73% survives . in the single - planet case , however , @xmath67 of the planets at @xmath64  au survives , @xmath68 escapes , and we observe no collisions .",
    "3 .   for the four giant planets in our solar system ( model  2 ) ,",
    "we observe a similar trend , although we see that jupiter is not substantially affected by planet - planet encounters , because of its large mass with respect to the other three planets .",
    "the planetary systems loose their planets at a rate of one per 100  myr ( model  1 ) and two per 100  myr ( model  2 ) , respectively . a gradual decrease in the escape rate",
    "is seen over time , due to the smaller number of remaining planets in each system .",
    "although our results apply to the two specific planetary systems a given star cluster environment , these results do demonstrate that multiplicity can not be ignored when studying the evolution of planetary systems in crowded environments .",
    "most of the planets semi - major axes are increased slightly after the each encounters .",
    "the majority of the planets obtain inclined and eccentric orbits .",
    "generally , these effects are strongest for the outer planets .",
    "typically a few percent of the planets are found in highly inclined or retrograde orbits at the end of the simulations .",
    "this applies to planets of any initial semi - major axis , and can be attributed to both the stellar encounters and planet - planet scattering .",
    "the latter process is dominant for the inner planets .",
    "the escaping planets are ejected with velocities up to several kms@xmath11 , but , as figure  [ figure : escapevelocities ] shows , the majority of these newly formed free - floating planets are unable to obtain velocities beyond the escape velocity of their host star cluster . in addition , we find that the escape velocity increases with the initial semi - major axis of the planets .    in summary , the presence of multiple planets in a planetary system results in a significantly different evolution as compared to single - planet systems , as a result of planet - planet interactions .",
    "our results on the orbital evolution and also our planet liberation rates per crossing time are in fair agreement with the earlier direct cluster simulations of @xcite , who find in their table  3 approximately one planet liberation per crossing time for their wide planets ( up to @xmath69  au ) .",
    "our model is a simplification of reality in a number of ways , and our assumptions should be improved and addressed in future work , ideally through directly modelling multi - planet systems in star clusters .",
    "we draw masses from an invariant chabrier mass distribution ( eq .  [ equation : chabrier ] ) , we draw the relative velocities from a local maxwellian distribution function , based on the average velocity dispersion of the plummer model ( eq .  [ equation : maxwellian ] ) , we draw impact parameters from a linear probability distribution function ( eq .  [ equation : impactparameter ] ) , and we assume that subsequent encounters are uncorrelated , well separated in time ( eq .  [ equation : poisson ] ) . in a real evolving star cluster",
    "all these assumptions are to some degree approximations , but the full star cluster simulation is a much larger numerical effort than our work here , and to some extent it is more complex to disentangle the effects of individual encounters in a full simulation , as can be seen from the rather complicated procedures used in @xcite to identify encounters in @xmath7-body simulations",
    ". it should be noted , however , that mass segregation , core collapse and the finite size of the core of a star cluster will lead to a time variation of the encounter parameters , and to a deviation from the simple distribution functions assumed here . in particular , it is known that in real star clusters the velocity distribution function can be far from a maxwellian @xcite .",
    "the encounter rate in a star cluster decreases with time as a result of expansion .",
    "in addition , a star may escape from a star cluster within a short time , after which the effect of stellar encounters on their planetary systems are negligible .",
    "we obtain approximate evolutionary tracks using the emacss code @xcite , and estimate the stellar encounter rate as a function of time under the approximation that the interactions are dominated by gravitational focusing ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as expected , the encounter rate gradually decreases over time , by a factor of two after 30  myr down to a factor of six after 100  myr .",
    "these estimates demonstrate that we may have overestimated the number of encounters typically experienced by a planetary system . on the other hand",
    ", star clusters may form sub - virial , and star forming regions observed to form with a significant amount of substructure in both the position and the velocity distribution , which can boost the number of close encounters during the early stages of star cluster evolution @xcite .",
    "finally , if a star cluster follows the evolutionary track listed above , many of its stars will suffer additional encounters until the cluster is completely dissolved .",
    "this shows again the need for full @xmath7-body simulations , which naturally include all processes described above . despite these approximations",
    ", we have demonstrated the importance of multiplicity of planetary systems , and we expect that improved future simulations will give qualitatively the same result .    we have also neglected the presence of binary systems , despite their presence in star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the galactic field @xcite .",
    "the effect of binary systems is complex , and depends strongly on the semi - major axis @xmath70 of the binary and the distance of closest approach @xmath38 of the centre - of - mass of the binary .",
    "encounters with sufficiently tight binaries ( @xmath71 ) have a very similar effect as encountering single stars , since they can , to first order , be considered as single bodies with a larger mass ( up to a factor two for equal - mass binary systems ) .",
    "very wide binaries ( @xmath72 ) also have a similar effect as single stars , as a planetary system only feels the nearby component of the binary system .",
    "the main difference with the encounters of single stars is that , while the centre - of - mass of a wide binary approaches impact parameter @xmath16 , the periastron distance of the nearest binary component may come closer to the planetary system .",
    "complex situations arise in the case of intermediate - period binaries with @xmath73 . in this case",
    ", both components of the binary system can affect the planetary system , but more importantly , highly destructive three - body interactions can occur . depending on the properties of the binary population in a star clusters , these types of interactions may or may not have an important effect on the survival of planetary systems .",
    "further work is definitely necessary to study the effect of binary systems .",
    "however , from the arguments above one can see that the inclusion of binaries , whether they are tight , intermediate , or wide , will generally cause further destruction of planetary systems .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to see how our results change when considering the immense diversity among the observed exoplanet systems .",
    "systems with a different number of planets , planetary masses , and relative separations will result in different outcomes .",
    "however , the general outcome of our simulations ( planets at any orbital separation are either directly or indirectly affected by distant stellar encounters ) is unlikely to change .",
    "future work will combine our ansatz with full star cluster simulations .",
    "the secular evolution of planetary systems between encounters in an @xmath7-body simulation of a large star cluster can be treated by either an adapted version of mercury code or by a generalisation of lagrange s planetary equations , while encounters will take place as in a real star cluster initialised by the time - dependent environment of a full @xmath7-body simulation .",
