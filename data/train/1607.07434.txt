    "<S> three avenues are apparent for such a measurement : antihydrogen , positronium , and muonium , the last requiring a precision atom interferometer and benefiting from a novel muonium beam under development . </S>",

    "<S> measurements of  to 10% , 1% , or better can be envisioned . </S>",
    "<S> this could constitute the first gravitational measurement of leptonic matter , of second - generation matter and , possibly , the first measurement of the gravitational acceleration of antimatter .    </S>",
    "<S> despite many years of effort , experiments on antimatter gravity have yet to yield a statistically significant direct measurement . </S>",

    "<S> _ indirect _ tests , based on the expected amounts of virtual antimatter in the nuclei of various elements , imply stringent limits on the gravitational acceleration , , of antimatter on earth : @xmath0.@xcite a _ direct _ test of the gravitational interaction of antimatter with matter seems desirable on quite general grounds@xcite and is of interest whether viewed as a test of general relativity or as a search for a fifth force . </S>",

    "<S> we are developing a precision three - grating atom - beam interferometer for the measurement of  using a slow muonium beam at switzerland s paul scherrer institute ( psi).@xcite the interferometer can measure the atoms gravitational deflection to a fraction of a nanometer , determining  to a precision of 10% of @xmath2 in a month of beam time ( assuming a typical 30% overall efficiency ) . </S>",

    "<S> a finer grating pitch @xmath7 is helpful ; we have chosen @xmath8 nm as a compromise between sensitivity and systematic error due to geometry variations over the @xmath9@xmath10 grating area . at the anticipated rate of @xmath11 muonium atoms </S>",
