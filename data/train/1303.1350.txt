    "let @xmath13 denote the class of harmonic functions @xmath3 in @xmath1 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus , every normalized harmonic function @xmath3 can be written by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for convenience .",
    "we next denote by @xmath19 the class of functions @xmath20 which are univalent and sense - preserving in @xmath1 .",
    "since the sense - preserving property of @xmath3 , we see that @xmath21 . if @xmath22 , then @xmath19 reduces to the class @xmath23 consisting of normalized analytic univalent functions .",
