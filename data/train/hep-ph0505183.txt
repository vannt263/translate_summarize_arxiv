    "measurement of the maximum electron energy in beta decay processes is the original approach @xcite to finding the absolute value of a possible neutrino mass .",
    "it is still a subject of great interest @xcite and may yield the first direct measurement of this crucial quantity .",
    "especially interesting is the process of tritium decay @xcite , @xmath1 in this paper , we discuss how results obtained from present neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite yield characteristic shapes for the beta decay endpoint spectrum which could help in signal identification @xcite .",
    "the main point is that the present oscillation data already predict fairly reliably a bi - unique description of the shape of the endpoint spectrum if the mass of any neutrino is specified .",
    "this fortunate situation arises since , as we will discuss , the only unknown mixing angle is strongly bounded and hence can not have much effect on the endpoint spectrum shape .",
    "so , running over the possible values of the third neutrino mass @xmath0 , we would get a  catalog \" of shapes which can be compared with the experimental shape to find a best fit .",
    "of course , there are a number of practical corrections to the observed end point spectrum other than just the phase space and neutrino mixing effects to be considered here .",
    "these include @xcite ( i ) different final masses of @xmath2 due to different final atomic electron states , ( ii ) corrections due to binding of @xmath3 in a molecule , ( iii ) resolution function of the detector , ( iv ) final state effects .",
    "the corrections should be made on each  page \" of the catalog obtained .",
    "we start in section ii with an exact numerical treatment of the phase space , which contains a relevant correction to the approximate treatment often used . in section iii",
    "we show that , as @xmath0 decreases from about the highest value considered to be consistent with information from cosmology , there are , in general , two solutions : type i where @xmath0 is the largest of the neutrino masses and type ii where @xmath0 is the smallest of all the neutrino masses .",
    "below about @xmath4 ev only the type ii solutions are allowed .",
    "a characteristic feature is that the neutrinos 1 and 2 are extremely close in mass ; their splittings range from about a ten thousandth of an ev to a hundredth of an ev . the end point spectrum shapes , showing the slope discontinuities corresponding to the vanishing of each neutrino s contribution , are plotted to illustrate these features . with a very great accuracy that might be achieved in the future , the spacings of the neutrinos could conceivably survive the needed corrections mentioned above",
    ". however the most practical procedure would probably be to integrate each corrected predicted spectrum shape ( of definite @xmath0 and type ) over an energy interval and then look to see which one is best fit by the experimental value .    in section",
    "iv we discuss some model restrictions on the ranges of @xmath0 which lead to type i and type ii solutions .",
    "these restrictions arise by assuming a so - called  complementary ansatz \" for the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the observation of @xmath0 in the non - allowed ranges would constitute a falsification of the ansatz .    finally , section v contains a brief summary and some discussion .",
    "taking the tritium decay example and assuming one massive neutrino for the time being , let @xmath5 be the mass of the tritium atom , @xmath6 the mass of @xmath2 , @xmath7 the electron mass and @xmath8 the neutrino mass .",
    "often @xcite , the kinetic part of the recoil nucleus energy is neglected so one has an easy approximate formula for the maximum electron energy : @xmath9 the exact formula , corresponding to the physical situation where the neutrino and the recoil nucleus both emerge with the same velocity is @xmath10 .",
    "\\label{exactform}\\ ] ]    to get an idea of the accuracy of the approximate formula we use @xcite the input masses ( in mev ) : @xmath11 to obtain table i. notice that in eq .",
    "( [ decimals ] ) we have , for the purpose of conveniently  tracking \" digits in this illustration , included more digits than warranted for the experimental accuracy of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    ".comparison of exact and approximate maximum electron energy for different neutrino masses .",
    "note that @xmath12 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it may be amusing to see why the ansatz leads to more restrictions .",
    "take the simplified case , treated in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath13",
    ". then the ansatz condition amounts to the lengths corresponding to the three neutrino masses forming a triangle in the complex plane .",
    "( the two independent majorana phases are related to the internal angles of this triangle ) .",
    "the procedure outlined here obtains , for a given assumed value of @xmath0 , the three neutrino masses .",
    "however it is not guaranteed that they form a triangle , since the mass of one neutrino may be greater than the sum of the masses of the two others .",
    "the case where @xmath14 in table [ typicalsolutions ] is an obvious example of this situation . in the case",
    "when @xmath15 is non - zero , treated in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is also a triangle condition but the triangle is not made simply using the masses as sides . at the present moment ,",
    "the  non - triangular \" regions of @xmath0 space constitute a small , but interesting , part of the allowed range ( considering of course the type i and type ii cases separately ) .",
    "the allowed regions are summarized in figs .",
    "[ restrictionsi ] and [ restrictionsii ] .",
    "so , if in the future , the neutrino masses are found from an endpoint spectrum analysis to give ( assuming suitably updated numbers ) @xmath0 outside the range predicted by the complementary ansatz , the latter can be ruled out .",
    "we have demonstrated that , given the value of the third neutrino mass @xmath0 , the endpoint spectrum of the electron energy in beta decay is biuniquely predicted to a reasonable approximation using the experimental results on neutrino oscillations and their analyses . for definiteness some characteristic endpoint spectrum shapes were explicitly illustrated .",
    "this seems important not only as an indication of how much our understanding of neutrinos has advanced in the last ten years but as a convenient benchmark for helping to analyze future beta decay experiments .",
    "of course the actual experimental results require other important corrections to this `` ideal '' theoretical picture .",
    "some novel features of this paper which may be of interest include :    \\1 . while the kinematics of the endpoint spectrum has been discussed many times in the literature , the exact formula for the phase space dependence on the electron energy ( obtained by performing one integration over the dalitz diagram while holding the invariant matrix element constant ) , eq .",
    "( [ phasespace ] ) , does not seem to have been previously used .",
    "these results may not make big changes in other analyses but one can use them with confidence since there will then be no question of kinematical ( nucleon recoil ) corrections needing to be separately taken into account .",
    "the method of analysis of the presently allowed neutrino masses using the squared mass differences obtained from the neutrino oscillation experiments presented in section iii involves listing the results for the masses of neutrinos one and two while choosing various values of the mass @xmath0 .",
    "the cases where @xmath0 is heaviest ( type i ) and where it is lightest ( type ii ) are treated separately .",
    "for example , as discussed in section iii , one sees that the currently allowed neutrino mass spectrum is characterized for a large part of its range as almost degenerate rather than hierarchical .",
    "the main point is that for any choice of @xmath0 and type , the shape of the endpoint spectrum is already pretty well known from the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "even though the value of @xmath16 is only bounded , it will not affect the shape much .",
    "our treatment easily shows that the slope discontinuities corresponding to the mass differences of individual neutrinos occur very close to each other . that would make detailed verification of the shape difficult in the near future .",
    "however , knowing the shape for any value of @xmath0 makes it possible to integrate the final electron distribution over an energy interval @xmath17 corresponding to a given experiment .",
    "then the number of predicted electrons could be plotted as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath17 to get an `` ideal '' estimate of the experimental sensitivity to distinguishing different neutrino mass scenarios .",
    "this ideal estimate should of course be corrected for effects mentioned in section i , but that is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "further applications of this approach will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the complementary ansatz for the neutrino mass matrix @xcite-@xcite enables one to predict , given @xmath0 and the `` dirac '' cp phase , the two majorana phases of the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "it is of interest because it enables the estimation of the neutrinoless double beta decay quantity @xmath18 and , in a certain model , the baryon asymmetry by the leptogenesis mechanism without making arbitrary assumptions about these phases .",
    "an amusing feature of the ansatz is that ( to the approximation that the effect of the dirac cp phase @xmath15 is negligible ) the magnitudes of the three neutrino masses must make up a triangle .",
    "if they do nt , the ansatz would be falsified . in section iv ,",
    "the regions of allowed neutrino masses which falsify the ansatz were specified ( including the effect of @xmath15 ) .",
    "it was pointed out that a large portion of the currently allowed range of @xmath0 actually does correspond to a triangular pattern of neutrino masses .",
    "however , the small non - triangular region near @xmath19 ev is the only place where @xmath0 is several times higher than @xmath20 .",
