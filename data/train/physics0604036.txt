    "in recent years physicists have paid much attention to network structures  describing either technological infrastructures or biological , genetic , logical or social relationships  as they play a prominent role in shaping the nature of the processes taking place on them and the resulting collective behavior .",
    "examples of how the structure affects the function of networked systems include the importance of shortcuts in endowing finite dimensional networks of the small world property @xcite and of scale - free degree distribution for robustness against failure @xcite or the relevance of motifs for specific dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "socio - economic networks offer an example where the relation between structure and function is not unidirectional .",
    "indeed their structure is inherently dynamical and it is shaped by the incentives of agents , i.e. by the socio - economic functions provided by the network .",
    "this paper discusses a class of generic model of stochastic dynamical social networks which make the interplay between structure and function of social network explicit in a simple way .",
    "we consider a set of agents  be they individuals or organisations  who establish bilateral interactions ( links ) when profitable .",
    "the network evolves under changing conditions .",
    "that is , the favourable circumstances that led at some point to the formation of a particular link may later on deteriorate , causing that link s removal .",
    "hence volatility ( exogenous or endogenous ) is a key disruptive element in the dynamics .",
    "concurrently , new opportunities arise that favour the formation of new links .",
    "whether linking occurs depends on factors related to the similarity or proximity of the two parties .",
    "for example , in cases where trust is essential in the establishment of new relationships ( e.g. in crime or trade networks ) , linking may be facilitated by common acquaintances or by the existence of a chain of acquaintances joining the two parties .",
    "in other cases ( e.g. in r&d or scientific networks ) , a common language , methodology , or comparable level of technical competence may be required for the link to be feasible or fruitful to both parties .    in a nutshell ,",
    "our model conceives the dynamics of the network as a struggle between volatility ( that causes link decay ) on the one hand , and the creation of new links ( that is dependent on similarity ) on the other .",
    "the model must also specify the dynamics governing inter - node similarity .",
    "a reasonable assumption in this respect is that such similarity is enhanced by close interaction , as reflected by the social network .",
    "for example , a firm ( or researcher ) benefits from collaborating with a similarly advanced partner , or individuals who interact regularly tend to converge on their social norms and other standards of behavior .",
    "we study different specifications of the general framework , each one embodying alternative forms of the intuitive idea that interaction promotes similarity .",
    "our main finding is that in all of these different cases the network dynamics exhibits a rich phenomenology characterized by a ) sharp phase transition b ) resilience , i.e. stability against deteriorating conditions and c ) equilibrium coexistence .",
    "the essential mechanism at work is a positive feedback between link creation and inter - node similarity , these two factors each exerting a positive effect on the other .",
    "feedback forces of this kind appear to operate in the dynamics of many social networks .",
    "we show that they are sufficient to produce the sharp transitions , resilience , and equilibrium co - existence that , as we will discuss in the next section , are salient features of many socio - economic phenomena .",
    "finally , this phenomenology bears a formal similarity with the liquid - gas phase transition , thus suggesting that a classification in terms of phases may be applicable also to socio - economic networks .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the next section discusses in an introductory way the empirical evidence which our model addresses .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we outline the general setup and a generic model of which we will discuss particular realizations the following sections .",
    "in particular , we shall first discuss the case where network formation depends on the topology of the network ( sect .",
    "[ sec : chain ] ) and then cases where it is coupled with the dynamics of a continuous ( sect . [",
    "sect : h ] ) or discrete ( sect .",
    "[ sec : potts ] ) variable .",
    "these two models addresses situations where homogeneity in some dimension ( e.g. technological levels or knowledge ) or coordination ( on e.g. a standard ) play a crucial role , respectively .",
    "numerical simulations will be supplemented by mean field analysis which provides a correct qualitative picture in all cases and , in some cases , accurate quantitative estimates . a case where an exact solution can be derived",
    "will be described in section [ sec : exact ] . in section [ sec : concl ] we end with some concluding remarks .",
    "there is a growing consensus among social scientists that many social phenomena display an inherent network dimension .",
    "not only are they embedded  in the underlying social network @xcite but , reciprocally , the social network itself is largely shaped by the evolution of those phenomena .",
    "the range of social problems subject to these considerations is wide and important .",
    "it includes , for example , the spread of crime @xcite and other social problems ( e.g. teenage pregnancy @xcite ) , the rise of industrial districts @xcite , and the establishment of research collaborations , both scientific @xcite and industrial @xcite . throughout these cases ,",
    "there are a number of interesting observations worth highlighting :    \\(a ) * sharp transitions * : _  the shift from a sparse to a highly connected network often unfolds rather abruptly ,  i.e. in a short timespan_. for example , concerning the escalation of social pathologies in some neighborhoods of large cities , crane @xcite writes that ... if the incidence [ of the problem ] reaches a critical point , the process of spread will explode .  also , considering the growth of research collaboration networks , goyal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report a steep increase in the per capita number of collaborations among academic economists in the last three decades , while hagerdoorn @xcite reports an even sharper ( ten - fold ) increase for r&d partnerships among firms during the decade 1975 - 1985 .",
    "( b ) *  resilience * : _  once the transition to a highly connected network has taken place , the network is robust , surviving even a reversion to unfavorable  conditions_. the case of california s silicon valley , discussed in a classic account by saxenian @xcite , illustrates this point well .",
    "its thriving performance , even in the face of the general crisis undergone by the computer industry in the 80 s , has been largely attributed to the dense and flexible networks of collaboration across individual actors that characterized it .",
    "another intrinsically network - based example is the rapid recent development of open - source software ( e.g. linux ) , a phenomenon sustained against large odds by a dense web of collaboration and trust @xcite .",
    "finally , as an example where robustness  has negative rather than positive implications ,  crane @xcite describes the difficulty , even with vigorous social measures , of improving a local neighborhood once crime and other social pathologies have taken hold .",
    "\\(c ) * equilibrium co - existence * : _ under apparently similar environmental conditions , social networks may be found both in a dense or sparse state_. again , a good illustration is provided by the dual experience of poor neighborhoods in large cities @xcite , where neither poverty nor other socio - economic conditions ( e.g. ethnic composition ) can alone explain whether or not there is degradation into a ghetto with rampant social problems . returning to r&d partnerships ,",
    "empirical evidence @xcite shows a very polarized situation , almost all r&d partnerships taking place in a few ( high - technology ) industries . even within those industries",
    ", partnerships are almost exclusively between a small subset of firms in ( highly advanced ) countries @xcite .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the above discussion raises the question of whether there is some common mechanism at work in the dynamics of social networks that , in a wide variety of different scenarios , produces the three features explained above : ( a ) discontinuous phase transitions , ( b ) resilience , and ( c ) equilibrium coexistence .",
    "our aim in this paper is to shed light on this question within a general framework that is flexible enough to accommodate , under alternative concrete specifications , a rich range of social - network dynamics .",
    "consider a set @xmath0 of agents , whose state and interactions evolve in continuous time @xmath1 .",
    "they form the nodes of a network which is described by a non - directed graph @xmath2 , where @xmath3 iff a link exists between agents @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the network evolution is modelled in terms of continuous time stochastic elementary poisson processes , and it is therefore defined by specifying the rates at which these processes occur @xcite .",
    "firstly , each node @xmath4 receives an opportunity to form a link with a node @xmath5 , randomly drawn from @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , at rate @xmath8 .",
    "if the link @xmath9 is not already in place , it forms with probability    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the distance  ( to be specified later ) between @xmath4 and @xmath5 prevailing at @xmath12 thus if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are close , in the sense that their distance is no higher than some given threshold @xmath13 , the link forms at rate @xmath8 ; otherwise , it forms at a much smaller rate @xmath14 .",
    "secondly , each existing link @xmath15 decays at rate @xmath16 .",
    "that is , each link in the network disappears with probability @xmath17 in a time interval @xmath18 .",
    "we shall discuss three different specifications of the distance @xmath19 , each capturing different aspects that may be relevant for socio - economic interactions .",
    "in all three cases , we mostly focus on the stationary state behavior , which we shall illustrate using both numerical simulations and a mean - field analytic approach . concerning the latter , we focus on the limit @xmath20 , for which the analysis is simpler .",
    "we characterise the long run behavior of the network solely in terms of the stationary degree distribution @xmath21 , which is the fraction of agents with @xmath22 neighbours .",
    "this corresponds to neglecting degree correlations , i.e. to approximating the network with a random graph ( see @xcite ) , an approximation which is reasonably accurate in the cases we discuss here .",
    "the degree distribution satisfies a master equation , which is specified in terms of the transition rates @xmath23 for the addition or removal of a link , for an agent linked with @xmath22 neighbours .",
    "while @xmath24 always takes the same form , the transition rate for the addition of a new link @xmath25\\ ] ] depends on the particular specification of the distance @xmath19 . matching the link creation and removal processes",
    ", yields an equation for the degree distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the probability @xmath26 , in its turn , will itself depend on the network density , i.e. on @xmath21 .",
    "our approach will then have the flavor of a self - consistent mean field approximation .",
    "consider first the simplest possible such specification where @xmath11 is the ( geodesic ) distance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 on the graph @xmath27 , neighbours @xmath5 of @xmath4 having @xmath28 , neighbours of the neighbours of @xmath4 ( which are not neighbours of @xmath29 ) having @xmath30 and so on . if no path joins @xmath4 and @xmath5 we set @xmath31 .",
    "this specific model describes a situation where the formation of new links is strongly influenced by proximity on the graph .",
    "it is a simple manifestation of our general idea that close interaction brings about similarity  here the two metrics coincide .",
    "we set @xmath32 , the link formation process then discriminates between agents belonging to the same network component ( which are joined by at least one path of links in @xmath33 ) and agents in different components .",
    "distinct components of the graph may , for example , represent different social groups .",
    "( [ pform ] ) captures the fact that belonging to the same social group is important in the creation of new links ( say , because it facilitates control or reciprocity @xcite ) .     as a function of @xmath16 (",

    "the results of a mean field theory for @xmath36 ( solid line ) are compared to numerical simulations ( @xmath37 ) starting from both low and high connected states with @xmath38 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to an unstable solution of the mean field equations which separates the basins of stability of the two solutions . for finite @xmath39",
    "the low density state flips  to the high density state when a random fluctuation in @xmath40 brings the system across the stability boundary ( i.e. when a sizable giant component forms ) .",

    "the high ( low ) density state is stable up ( down ) to the points marked with @xmath37 ( @xmath41 ) and is unstable at points marked with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath40 along the dashed line is reported in the main figure . ]",
    "consider first what happens when @xmath44 is small .",
    "let @xmath40 be the average connectivity ( number of links per node ) in the network .",
    "the average rate @xmath45 of link removal is very high when @xmath40 is significant .",
    "consequently , we expect to have a very low @xmath46 , which in turn implies that the population should be fragmented into many small groups . under these circumstances ,",
    "the likelihood that an agent @xmath4 meets  an agent @xmath5 in the same component is negligible for large populations , and therefore new links are created at a rate equal to @xmath47 . by balancing link creation and link destruction , the average number of neighbours of an agent is @xmath48 , as is indeed found in our simulations ( fig [ fig_giant ] ) .    as @xmath49 increases",
    ", the network density @xmath46 increases gradually .",
    "then , at a critical value @xmath50  when @xmath51  a giant component forms .",
    "the system makes a discontinuous jump ( fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] ) to a state containing a large and densely interconnected community covering a finite fraction of the population .",
    "if @xmath44 decreases back again beyond the transition point @xmath52 , the dense network remains stable .",
    "the dense network dissolves back into a sparsely connected one only at a second point @xmath53 .",
    "this phenomenology characterises a wide region of parameter space ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] ) and is qualitatively well reproduced by a simple mean field approach .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a similar phenomenology occurs when @xmath54 , i.e. when links are preferentially formed with friends of friends @xcite . in this case , however , the probability that two arbitrary nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 have @xmath55 is of order @xmath56 in a network with finite degree . hence for finite @xmath57 and @xmath58 non - linear effect manifest only for networks of finite sizes @xcite .",
    "we finally mention that the model with @xmath59 is reminiscent of a model that was recently proposed @xcite to describe a situation where ( as e.g. in job search @xcite ) agents find new linking opportunities through current partners . in @xcite agents use their links to search for new connections , whereas here existing links favour new link formation . in spite of this conceptual difference , the model in ref .",
    "@xcite also features the phenomenology ( a)-(c ) above , i.e. sharp transitions , resilience , and phase coexistence .",
    "the transition rate for the addition of a new link is @xmath60 if the two agents are in different components and @xmath61 if they are in the same component , where the factor @xmath62 comes because each node can either initiate or receive a new link . in the large @xmath39 limit",
    "the latter case only occurs with some probability if the graph has a giant component @xmath63 which contains a finite fraction @xmath64 of nodes .",
    "for random graphs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) the fraction of nodes in @xmath63 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the generating function and @xmath67 is the probability that a link , followed in one direction , does not lead to the giant component .",
    "the latter satisfies the equation @xmath68 hence @xmath69 is the probability an agent with @xmath22 neighbours has no links connecting him to the giant component , and hence is itself not part of the giant component .",
    "then the rate of addition of links takes the form @xmath70 .\\ ] ] the stationary state condition of the master equation leads to the following equation for @xmath71 @xmath72\\phi ( s)-2 \\eta ( 1-\\epsilon ) \\gamma \\phi ( us )   \\label{phis}\\ ] ] which can be solved numerically to the desired accuracy . notice that eq .",
    "( [ phis ] ) is a self - consistent problem , because the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath67 depend on the solution @xmath71 .",
    "the solution of this equation is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] .",
    "either one or three solutions are found , depending on the parameters . in the latter case , the intermediate solution is unstable ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_giant ] ) , and it separates the basins of attraction of the two stable solutions within the present mean field theory .    the solution is exact where there is no giant component , and numerical simulations show that the mean field approach is very accurate away from the phase transition from the connected to the disconnected state . near the transition to the disconnected state our approximation , that an agent s degree fully specifies its state , breaks down .",
    "this causes the theory to overestimate the size of the coexistence region .",
    "next , we consider a setup where @xmath19 reflects proximity of nodes @xmath4 , @xmath5 in terms of some continuous ( non - negative ) real attributes , @xmath74 , @xmath75 . this case has been dealt with in ref .",

    "the attribute @xmath76 could represent the level of technical expertise of two firms involved in an r&d partnership , or the competence of two researchers involved in a joint project .",
    "it could also be a measure of income or wealth that bears on the quality and prospects of a bilateral relationship .",
    "we assume that each agent @xmath4 receives an attribute update ( or upgrade ) possibility at a rate @xmath77 .",

    "since @xmath293 , there is no giant component and the system is composed of many disconnected components of few nodes .",
    "the solution with @xmath287 is however non - trivial . in this case",
    "we have a network whose @xmath21 is the sum of two poisson distributions , one of which has @xmath234 and thus a giant component , whilst the other ( consisting of @xmath254 separate networks plus the @xmath294 nodes ) has @xmath235 and thus has no giant component .     against time for networks starting in an initially unconnected state with @xmath295 and @xmath177 and @xmath199 .",
    "the curve on the top right is @xmath296 and the other is @xmath297 .",
    "[ freezingfig ] ]    even if @xmath268 states are unstable , they may occur in the early stages of the stochastic evolution of the network .",
    "figure [ freezingfig ] shows time - series plots of simulations for relatively large @xmath8 ( @xmath298 ) , starting in an initially unconnected state .",
    "although the @xmath297 solution eventually reaches its expected value of @xmath299 , its approach to that value is not smooth as might have been expected .",
    "rather we find that the network spends some time in an intermediate @xmath268 metastable state .",
    "as we move to @xmath296 , the time spent in metastable states increases substantially , failing to reach the stationary @xmath269 state ( where @xmath300 ) despite the relatively long simulation time .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that initially more than one giant component forms , with different values of @xmath221 .",
    "this state persists for a typical time @xmath301 which is inversely proportional to the eigenvalue of the unstable mode .",
    "hence @xmath302 becomes very long when @xmath263 is large .",
    "the reason why the dynamics is so slow depends on the fact that in order for nodes to migrate from one component @xmath221 to another one , they have to loose all their links .",
    "such a process is limited by the density @xmath303 of nodes in component @xmath221 with @xmath304 , which is very small when @xmath263 is large ( @xmath305 ) .    in such a situation introducing a stochastic element in agents choice ( i.e. switching on @xmath306 ) or allowing for the formation of uncoordinated links ( i.e. @xmath307 ) would make the system converge very fast to the coordinated state . in other words",
    ", this is a case where a finite `` temperature '' may allow the agents to find the global optimum more quickly and it might be rational for agents to resort to a stochastic choice rule .",
    "the ability to find an optimal state more quickly is also of advantage if there are external ( exogenous ) shocks which occasionally perturb the system .",
    "the @xmath194 case is of particular interest because it can be solved exactly . for the other models described here , the coordination / correlation of the nodes were too complex for us to analyse exactly . in this section",
    "we have exactly solved a non - trivial network model .",
    "this was possible because of the fact that an agent only changes its spin if it has degree zero .",
    "the network is found to be the sum of @xmath148 poissonian random graphs @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a general theoretical setup to study the dynamics of a social network that is flexible enough to admit a wide variety of particular specifications .",
    "we have studied three such specifications , each illustrating a distinct way in which the network dynamics may interact with the adjustment of node attributes . in all these cases , network evolution displays the three features ( sharp transitions , resilience , and equilibrium co - existence ) that empirical research has found to be common to many social - network phenomena .",
    "our analysis indicates that these features arise as a consequence of the cumulative self - reinforcing effects induced by the interplay of two complementary considerations . on the one hand",
    ", there is the subprocess by which agent similarity is enhanced across linked ( or close - by ) agents . on the other hand ,",
    "there is the fact that the formation of new links is much easier between similar agents .",
    "when such a feedback process is triggered , it provides a powerful mechanism that effectively offsets the link decay induced by volatility .",
    "the similarity - based forces driving the dynamics of the model are at work in many socio - economic environments .",
    "thus , even though fruitful economic interaction often requires that the agents involved display some complementary diversity  in certain dimensions ( e.g. buyers and sellers ) , a key prerequisite is also that agents can coordinate in a number of other dimensions ( e.g. technological standards or trading conventions ) .",
    "analogous considerations arise as well in the evolution of many other social phenomena ( e.g. the burst of social pathologies discussed above ) that , unlike what is claimed e.g. by crane @xcite , can hardly be understood as a process of epidemic contagion on a _ given _ network .",
    "it is by now well understood @xcite that such epidemic processes do _ not _ match the phenomenology reported in empirical research .",
    "our model suggests that a satisfactory account of these phenomena must aim at integrating both the dynamics _ on _ the network with that _ of _ the network itself as part of a genuinely co - evolutionary process .",
    "one common feature of all the models discussed in this paper is that stable states can have either a single giant component or none .",
    "many real situations are characterized by stable states with a multitude of distinct components , barely connected .",
    "one example is the polarization of opinion ( e.g. in politics ) where the tendency of individuals to have opinions similar to those of the peers they interact with may also lead to the segregation of the population in different communities , of like mined individuals .",
    "the results presented here suggest that there must be a specific mechanism which is responsible for such a polarization .",
    "we hope that future work in this direction may shed some light on this issue .",
