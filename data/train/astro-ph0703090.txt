    "first , the correction for extinction in the ir is smaller than in the optical and uv , and therefore errors in the extinction coefficient and law affect ir line fluxes less .",

    "our helium , argon and neon abundances are all close to previous results . for the remaining elements , we discuss reasons why our results differ from previous ones below . the abundances of ar , ne , s , and o determined in this study should be more accurate and precise than in previous studies because we have used infrared lines that are less sensitive to temperature and extinction than optical and uv lines .",
    "the sulfur abundance determined in this study is lower than previously reported .",
    "@xcite used an icf of 39.18 to account for unseen s@xmath44 , and such a large icf leads to a large uncertainty in their sulfur abundance result .",
    "@xcite used an icf of 3.13 to account for unseen s@xmath49 and s@xmath44 . therefore , while we report a lower sulfur abundance than previous authors , it is more accurate because we observe both s@xmath49 and s@xmath44 in the ir spectrum and thus we do not need to use an icf .",
    "the oxygen abundance derived here is somewhat lower than given in former studies .",
    "this is mainly due to our use of the o@xmath44 25.89  line to determine the o@xmath44 abundance , because the icfs of previous studies overestimated the amount of o@xmath44 .",
    "we find that the o@xmath44 abundance is only 15% of the total oxygen abundance , while icfs used in previous studies assume that o@xmath44 contributes between 42% and 57% of the total oxygen abundance .",
    "the nitrogen and carbon abundances determined here and in previous studies are uncertain .",
    "the nitrogen abundances determined from the two optical studies have large uncertainties because the optical studies must use large icfs ( @xcite use 33.9 and @xcite use 1279.69 ) to account for unseen n@xmath40 , n@xmath44 , and n@xmath45 .",
    "this study and that of @xcite use uv lines for important ionization stages that dominate the element abundances of nitrogen and carbon . however , the ionic abundances determined from uv lines are very sensitive to the adopted electron temperature and extinction .",
    "for example , lowering ( raising ) the adopted t@xmath24 by just 1000 k leads to an increase of @xmath1670% ( decrease of @xmath1640% ) in the derived nitrogen and carbon abundances . lowering ( raising ) the adopted c@xmath0  by 0.10 leads to up to a @xmath1630% decrease ( increase ) in the derived nitrogen and carbon abundances .",
    "we use a higher t@xmath24 than @xcite ( we use t@xmath24=12700 k and they use t@xmath24=11000 k ) , and we use a lower extinction ( we use c@xmath0=0.27 whereas they use c@xmath0=0.40 ) . increasing the temperature and decreasing the extinction both have the effect of lowering the abundances derived from uv lines , causing the nitrogen and carbon element abundances derived in this study to be less than those derived by @xcite .",
    "the average of the ar , ne , and o abundances gives a metallicity of @xmath160.45 z@xmath50 , with an uncertainty of roughly 30% .",
    "these elements are left relatively unchanged during stellar evolution .",
    "thus their low abundances imply that ic  2448 s progenitor star formed from metal deficient material , with a metallicity closer to that of the large magellanic cloud than to that of the sun .",
    "sulfur is also left relatively unchanged during stellar evolution .",
    "however , many pne have low sulfur abundances compared to solar , and so the sulfur abundance is not used in the average metallicity calculation .",
    "the sulfur abundance of ic  2448 is lower than the sulfur abundances of all 26 of the pne studied by @xcite , which supports the idea of a subsolar composition for ic  2448 s progenitor star .",
    "the abundance of helium derived here for ic  2448 is somewhat above solar , which implies that some chemical processing took place within ic  2448 s progenitor star .",
    "the nitrogen and carbon abundances are more uncertain , but close to solar .",
    "@xcite use their determinations of ic  2448 s stellar gravity ( log _ g _ = 4.8 ) and effective temperature ( t@xmath51 = 65000 k ) to derive the current mass of ic  2448 s star as 0.58 m@xmath50 .",
    "this current stellar mass corresponds to an initial stellar mass of m@xmath52 @xmath53 1 m@xmath50 at a metallicity of z = 0.5 - 1.0 z@xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this low stellar mass , along with the low metallicity of ic  2448 s progenitor star , imply that the first and perhaps the third dredge - up occurred .",
    "first dredge - up would have increased the abundances of @xmath32he , @xmath54n , and @xmath55c , decreased the abundance of @xmath56c , and left the @xmath57o abundance the same @xcite .",
    "second dredge - up ( which increases @xmath32he and @xmath54n but decreases @xmath56c , @xmath55c , and @xmath57o ) is only expected to occur if the initial mass of the progenitor star is between 3 and 5 m@xmath50 @xcite , and so it is not expected to occur here .",
    "third dredge - up , which significantly increases @xmath32he and @xmath56c and slightly increases the amounts of some other elements @xcite , might have occurred .",
    "it is expected to occur in stars that have m@xmath58 1.5 m@xmath50 at z = z@xmath50 , but this limit is at lower masses for lower z @xcite .",
    "third dredge - up enriches the amount of carbon relative to oxygen , and thus a c / o ratio greater than one would indicate that third dredge - up occurred @xcite .",
    "the c / o ratio in ic  2448 derived here is 1.1 , but the carbon abundance of ic  2448 is very uncertain as discussed above .",
    "thus we can not determine if the c / o ratio is really greater or less than one .",
    "the ir spectrum of ic  2448 ( figure [ spectrum ] ) does not show pahs which are often observed in pne with c / o @xmath59 1 , nor does it show silicates which are often observed in pne with c / o @xmath21 1 @xcite . the uncertainty in our carbon abundance and the lack of pahs and silicates in the ir spectrum",
    "do not allow us to determine if ic  2448 is carbon - rich or oxygen - rich .",
    "the abundances of ic  2448 are close to the abundances of pn ic  2165 which is a spherical nebula with a low mass ( @xmath18 3 m@xmath50 ) progenitor star @xcite .",
    "ic  2165 probably experienced third dredge - up ( in addition to first dredge - up ) because it has c / o @xmath16 2 @xcite .",
    "the elements not much affected by the various dredge - up episodes ( ar , ne , s , and o ) all have subsolar values in ic  2448 and ic  2165 , which implies that the progenitor stars of these nebula were created from metal deficient gas .    the ir continuum of ic  2448 gives a cool dust temperature of @xmath16 100 k , supporting previous studies that show ic  2448 to be an old , evolved nebula .",
    "additionally , ir lines that would come from the photodissociation region such as [ ] and [ ] are not observed .",
    "perhaps this indicates that most of the photodissociation region has been destroyed , which fits the picture of ic  2448 being an old pn where the ionization front has gobbled up most of the photodissociation region .",
    "this is the first mid - ir spectral study of ic  2448 .",
    "the abundance of helium is slightly above solar , indicating that some chemical enrichment has occurred .",
    "the high uncertainties in the nitrogen and carbon abundances ( due to their reliance on abundances determined from uv lines which depend strongly on the electron temperature and to a lesser extent on the extinction ) make it difficult to determine how much chemical enrichment occurred .",
    "the elements not affected much by stellar evolution ( ar , ne , s , and o ) all have subsolar values in ic  2448 , indicating that the progenitor star formed out of somewhat metal deficient material .",
    "our use of infrared ionic lines which are less sensitive to extinction and temperature , and some of which arise from ions with no observable lines in the optical or uv , leads to a more accurate determination of abundances for ar , ne , s , and o than previously possible .",
    "the abundances determined fit with the picture of ic  2448 having a low mass progenitor star that underwent first and perhaps third dredge - up .",
    "the ir continuum gives a cool dust temperature of @xmath16 100 k , supporting previous studies that show ic  2448 to be an old , evolved nebula .",
    "additionally , lines that would arise from the pdr are missing or weak , indicating that much of the pdr is destroyed , consistent with ic  2448 being an old pn .",
