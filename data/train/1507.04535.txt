    "the spin is a fundamental quantum object and an important candidate for various quantum technologies such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy , quantum metrology , and quantum information processing .",
    "an essential requirement in these developments is the precise control of many spins or alternatively a large spin composed of the constituent spins .",
    "the simplest case of such control is the rotation around a fixed axis . accurately describing this process requires high - precision calculations of the wigner s d - matrix  @xcite that quantifies the rotation of angle @xmath4 around the @xmath5 axis : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an eigenstate of @xmath8 with eigenvalue @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "hereinafter , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "high - precision calculations of the d - matrix is of interest in quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "for instance , let us consider an atomic ramsey ( or equivalently , mach - zehnder ) interferometer fed with all spins down as the paradigmatic setup of interferometric phase estimation .",
    "these spins then undergo an unknown phase shift @xmath13 via the evolution @xmath14 inside the interferometer . finally , by detecting the population imbalance at the output port of the interferometer , i.e. , the @xmath1 measurement with respect to the output state @xmath15",
    ", one can record @xmath16 possible outcomes .",
    "the outcome @xmath9 occurs with probability @xmath17^{2}$ ] conditioned on the unknown parameter @xmath13 , thus @xmath13 can be inferred from appropriate data processing on the outcomes .",
    "this process , however , requires accurate evaluation of wigner s d - matrix .",
    "in addition , the ultimate sensitivity of this estimation is determined by the fisher information  fisher , helstrom , pezze : @xmath18^{2}/p_{m}(\\theta ) $ ] , which requires accurate evaluation of the first - order derivative of wigner s d - matrix .",
    "in addition to quantum metrology , the wigner s d - matrix is closely related to spherical harmonics and legendre polynomials and is of interest in many other fields  @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation of the d - matrix for large spins ( @xmath19 ) suffers from a serious loss of precision , due to the presence of large numbers that exceed the floating - point precision in wigner s original formula  @xcite . to avoid this problem ,",
    "the d - matrix has been calculated by means of recurrence relations  @xcite .",
    "this method still encounters severe numerical instability in the case of high spin , although a few remedies have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "recently , gumerov and duraiswami  @xcite have developed a new recursion relation for each subspace of spins , which greatly improves the stability .",
    "however , the achievable precision ( i.e. , the maximum absolute error ) of their results remains unclear .",
    "most recently , tajima  tajima proposed fourier - series expansion of the wigner s d - matrix and convert the accurate evaluation of the d - matrix to that of the fourier coefficients .",
    "such a fourier - series representation has been shown to be more useful in improving the numerical stability and the precision . however , each fourier coefficient is still a sum of many large numbers that exceed the floating - point precision , so it has to be evaluated with the assistance of a formula - manipulation software  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we put forward a very simple method to resolve the above large - number problem in evaluating the fourier coefficients of wigner s d - matrix  @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is to express these coefficients via the inner products @xmath20 , where the eigenstates of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath21 constitute an orthonormalized and completed set . to evaluate such inner products , we write down @xmath0 as a hermitian matrix in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 .",
    "then we numerically diagonalize the @xmath0 matrix to obtain the eigenstates and the inner products . due to the normalization of @xmath22 ,",
    "the norm of each fourier coefficient is not larger than unity , thus we avoid the large - number problem in floating - point calculations .",
    "this method allows us to evaluate accurately the d - matrix and its various derivatives for much larger spins up to a few thousands , with an absolute error @xmath23 for the d - matrix and @xmath24 for its @xmath25th - order derivative .",
    "for large spin @xmath26 , numerical calculation of the wigner s formula is subject to intolerable numerical errors because it is a sum of many large numbers with alternating signs  @xcite : @xmath27where @xmath28and @xmath29 $ ] . taking @xmath30 as an example , the term @xmath31 has a very large magnitude latexmath:[$%    floating - point precision when @xmath19 .    to avoid this problem ,",
    "tajima  @xcite has proposed to expand the wigner s d - matrix into a complex fourier series : @xmath33this representation of the d - matrix is very useful and free from the large - number errors since each fourier coefficient is less than or equal to @xmath34 ( see below ) . however , an accurate evaluation of the fourier coefficients @xmath35 by means of eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) remains nontrivial .",
    "this is because the large - number problem still exists in the coefficients : @xmath36 ^{\\ast } d\\theta   \\notag \\\\",
    "\\!&=&\\!\\sum_{k=\\max ( 0,n - m)}^{\\min ( j - m , j+n)}\\ ! w_{k}^{(j , m , n)}i_{\\mu } ( 2j,2k+m - n ) ,   \\label{coeff}\\end{aligned}\\]]where we have introduced an integral@xmath37with @xmath38 $ ] . when @xmath19 , some terms in the integral are still huge ( e.g. , the term @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ) .",
    "tajima  @xcite bypassed this problem by employing a symbolic computation software and then reducing the results to double - precision floating numbers .",
    "here , instead of using eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) , we present a very simple method to calculate the fourier coefficients @xmath35 that free from the above mentioned large - number problem .",
    "the key observation is that the d - matrix can be rewritten as @xmath42where @xmath43 are eigenstates of @xmath0 and they constitute an ortho - normalized and completed set , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath7 for the eigenstates of @xmath8 and @xmath22 for the eigenstates of @xmath46 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dmn3 ] ) , we identify the fourier coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) as @xmath47which obeys the sum rule @xmath48 . from eq.([tmn2b ] ) , one can note that all the fourier coefficients and hence the d - matrix for arbitrary @xmath4 depend on @xmath49 only  @xcite .",
    "the elements of the d - matrix are real and obey the following symmetry properties ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , and also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : @xmath50from which one can easily obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as observed recently by tajima  @xcite .     ( with total spin @xmath53 ) against @xmath9 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( a ) , @xmath56 ( b ) , and @xmath57 ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines in bottom panel are the boundary of the central region , determined by eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) . outside the region , the values of @xmath58 are almost vanishing . ]",
    "most importantly , the first result of eq .",
    "( [ tmn2b ] ) provides a very simple but accurate method to calculate the fourier coefficients and hence the wigner s d - matrix by solving the inner product @xmath59 . to this end",
    ", we first express @xmath0 as a ( @xmath60)-dimensional hermitian matrix:@xmath61where the matrix elements are determined by @xmath62 , with the term @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "next , we diagonalize the hermitian matrix using standard numerical methods , e.g. , the zhbev subroutine of lapack , or the evchf package of the imsl , to obtain all the eigenvectors @xmath66 and their probability amplitudes @xmath67 . for the simplest case @xmath68 ,",
    "the matrix is indeed the transpose of the pauli matrix @xmath69 over two ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) , which gives two eigenvectors @xmath71 , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath72 .",
    "the inner products @xmath67 for @xmath68 are given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "inserting them into eq .",
    "( [ dmn3 ] ) , one can obtain the wigner s d - matrix .",
    "the exact - diagonalization method has two advantages .",
    "first , the magnitude of @xmath67 and hence all the coefficients @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ tmn2b ] ) are not larger than unity , since all the eigenvectors @xmath66 are normalized .",
    "this provides a solution to the large - number problem in eqs .",
    "( [ formula ] ) and ( [ coeff ] ) .",
    "second , the matrix in eq .  ( [ jy ] ) is tridiagonal and hermitian , which can be easily diagonalized . by diagonalizing the @xmath76 matrix only once , all the fourier coefficients and hence all the elements of the d - matrix",
    "can be obtained with given @xmath26 and @xmath13 ( see the supplemental material  supplemental ) .",
    "this method allows us to calculate wigner s d - matrix for @xmath26 up to a few thousands .",
    "more important , one can compute arbitrary @xmath25-th order derivative of the d - matrix with little additional cost , due to @xmath77this is indeed a common advantage of the fourier - series representation .",
    "as comparison , one can find that the direct evaluation of the first result of eq .",
    "( [ derivative ] ) costs double even for the case @xmath78 since @xmath79 gives @xmath80 , \\label{1thderivative}\\]]which depends on two elements of the d - matrix . when @xmath81 , only one of them remains .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] , we plot the computed results of @xmath82 in the plane ( @xmath83 ) , with @xmath84 $ ] . for a relatively large spin @xmath53 and a given @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath82 is appreciable only in the central region and tend to zero quickly outside this region .",
    "the boundary of this region is determined by ( see also the dashed lines of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) @xmath85at which @xmath86 for @xmath78 , @xmath87 .",
    "this boundary equation follows from the differential equation of the d - matrix  @xcite .",
    "similar boundary equation has been obtained using the wkb approximation  @xcite .    given the exact value @xmath88 and the numerically calculated value @xmath89 of a matrix element @xmath90 , the absolute error is defined as @xmath91 and the relative error is defined as @xmath92 .",
    "the exact values of the d - matrix elements are obtained by mathematica 10.0 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that the absolute error @xmath93 even for a relatively larger spin @xmath94 ( see also fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the relative error @xmath95 within the central region ( enclosed by the dashed line ) , but increases rapidly outside this region .",
    "outside the boundary , the large relative error simply follows from the very small exact values @xmath96 . to illustrate this point",

    "[ fig2](d ) ] .",
    "by contrast , although the numerically calculated values @xmath102 are very close to zero , they are much larger than the exact values , leading to a large relative error @xmath103 .",
    "( the upper panel ) and the relative error @xmath104 ( the lower panel ) of the wigner s d - matrix @xmath58 with the spin @xmath94 , and the rotation angle @xmath55 ( left ) , @xmath56 ( middle ) , @xmath57 ( right ) , respectively .",
    "the computed results are obtained by diagonazing the matrix in eq .",

    "the dashed lines are given by eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) . ]    due to the same reason , the d - matrix elements for other values of @xmath4 also show large @xmath106 outside the central region .",
    "for example , @xmath107 , the boundary of the central region is a circle : @xmath108 with a radius @xmath109 .",
    "the d - matrix elements with @xmath110 , which is much smaller than the numerically calculated value @xmath111 , yielding a large @xmath106 .",

    ", we use the exact result  @xcite @xmath114where @xmath115 is the associated legendre polynomial . when @xmath116 , we obtain the exact results @xmath117 for odd @xmath118 .",

    "( solid circles ) and that of @xmath120 ( open circles ) as functions of spin @xmath26 .",

    "the precision of the d - matrix can reach @xmath124 at @xmath94 .",
    "red dashed line : maximum error of the first - order derivative @xmath125 . ]    finally , we discuss the scaling of the error in evaluating the d - matrix and its various derivatives with increasing spin @xmath26 . for this purpose , we sweep @xmath126 and @xmath4 and calculate the maximum absolute errors @xmath127 for @xmath90 and @xmath128 as functions of @xmath26 for @xmath26 up to 100 . since the maximum absolute error of the d - matrix almost appears inside the boundary ( see the upper panel of fig .",

    "this precision is slightly worse than the previous one @xmath139 for the spin @xmath26 up to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , if the scaling persists to larger @xmath26 , our method could provide a smaller error as @xmath140 .",
    "one can also note that the maximum absolute error of @xmath128 can be approximated by @xmath141 ( the dashed line ) .",
    "more generally , from eqs .",
    "( [ dmn3 ] ) and ( [ derivative ] ) , we can deduce that the maximum absolute error in evaluating the @xmath25th - order derivative @xmath142 is larger than that of the d - matrix by a factor @xmath143 .",
    "in summary , we have presented a very simple method to evaluate accurately the wigner s d - matrix by diagonalizing the angular - momentum operator @xmath0 in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 .",

    "as one of the main advantages , we show that for given @xmath26 and @xmath13 , all the elements of wigner s d - matrix and their @xmath25-th order derivatives can be obtained by diagonalizing @xmath0 only once  @xcite .",
    "the method presented here is a part of the larger class of algorithms based on the matrix exponents  @xcite . as the matrix exponent of @xmath76 ,",
