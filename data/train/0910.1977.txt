    "an important observable in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the azimuthal anisotropy of the momentum distributions of produced particles in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction , particularly the so - called elliptic flow ( @xmath4 ) that corresponds to the second fourier coefficient in their azimuthal angle distribution  @xcite .",
    "the measured elliptic flow is not only large but also shows a constituent quark number scaling , especially at intermediate transverse momenta , i.e. , the dependence of the elliptic flows of identified hadrons on their transverse momenta becomes similar if both are divided by the number of constituent quarks in a hadron .",
    "this scaling behavior of hadron elliptic flows is well described by the quark coalescence model for hadron production from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . also , the measured elliptic flows of identified hadrons follow a mass ordering at low transverse momenta , namely , the strength of the elliptic flow becomes smaller as the hadron mass increases .",
    "this has also been well described by the transport model  @xcite as well as by the ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "recently , the elliptic flow of deuterons has been measured in au+au collisions at energy @xmath3  gev  @xcite .",
    "the data from the phenix collaboration covers the intermediate transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) region  @xcite , while the star collaboration has made measurements in a wider range of @xmath5 including the low @xmath5 region  @xcite .",
    "the two measurements agree well at intermediate @xmath5 region ( @xmath6  gev@xmath7 ) except that the star data show a negative elliptic flow at low @xmath5 ( @xmath8  gev@xmath7 ) .",
    "a negative elliptic flow has also been seen in the preliminary data from the phenix collaboration for @xmath9 s at @xmath10  gev@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "negative values of deuteron elliptic flow can not be explained by the coalescence model unless nucleons have negative elliptic flows  @xcite , while negative @xmath9 flows may  @xcite or may not  @xcite require negative charm quark elliptic flows . since measured nucleon elliptic flow does not show any negative value in small transverse momentum region  @xcite , observed negative values of deuteron elliptic flow raise an interesting question on the mechanism for their production and interactions in relativistic heavy ion collisions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two of us have studied deuteron production at rhic in a dynamical model which is based on the time - dependent perturbation theory . using the elementary reactions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ,",
    "we have computed the production rate of deuterons using the measured nucleon transverse momentum distribution that is parameterized by an effective temperature and a momentum - dependent elliptic flow .",
    "although the energy is conserved in this approach , in contrast with the coalescence model , it needs the introduction of the reaction time and volume as parameters to fix the multiplicity of deuterons .",
    "the resulting deuteron @xmath5 spectrum and elliptic flow are found to be similar to those of the coalescence model based on the same nucleon momentum distribution .",
    "compared to the experimental data  @xcite , the calculated deuteron @xmath5 spectrum is , however , too soft . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is due to the use of an effective temperature to model the effect of radial flow , resulting in the absence of correlations between nucleon positions and momenta . for the elliptic flow of deuterons",
    ", this approach describes reasonably the experimental data except at small @xmath5 , where it gives positive values while the data show negative values  @xcite .    to overcome the shortcomings of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use in the present work a transport model to study deuteron production and elliptic flow in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we assume that the particles produced from hadronization of the created quark - gluon plasma are in thermal and chemical equilibrium and undergo collective motions , similar to those described by the blast wave model  @xcite , and they then interact with each other via hadronic rescattering . for the latter , we use a relativistic transport model ( art )  @xcite code embedded in a multiphase transport model ( ampt )  @xcite .",
    "we also carry out a coalescence model calculation using the freeze - out nucleons to form deuterons .",
    "this approach is different from the coalescence model used in ref .  @xcite as it includes the position and momentum correlations of final nucleons through their collective motions introduced in the initial blast wave model and further generated by final hadronic rescattering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we describe the blast wave model used for generating the hadrons produced at hadronization that are taken as the initial conditions in the transport model for describing hadronic rescattering .",
    "section  [ sec : hadrons ] gives the results for the transverse momentum distributions and elliptic flows of pions and protons after hadronic scattering .",

    "these results are further compared in section  [ sec : coal ] with those from the dynamical coalescence model .",
    "we also compare in section  [ sec : emission ] the deuteron emission time distributions from these two models and discuss in section  [ sec : scaling ] the nucleon number of scaling of deuteron elliptic flow .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] contains a summary and discussions .",
    "the elementary production and annihilation processes for deuterons that are included in the transport model are described in the appendix .",
    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions , where a quark - gluon plasma is produced , hadrons are initially formed during hadronization of the qgp . to describe the distribution of these hadrons",
    ", we use the blast - wave model which assumes that they are in thermal and chemical equilibrium and undergo a collective expansion . as in the art model , we include in the present work mesons such as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and baryons such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 as well as their anti - particles . we also include both deuterons and anti - deuterons in the initial distributions .",
    "the lorentz - invariant thermal distribution @xmath25 of these particles at temperature @xmath26 is then given by @xmath27 where the four - momentum @xmath28 is @xmath29 and the flow four - velocity @xmath30 is @xmath31 in the above , @xmath32 is the energy - momentum rapidity , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the transverse mass with @xmath35 being the mass of the considered particle , @xmath36 , and @xmath17 ( @xmath15 ) is the longitudinal ( transverse ) flow rapidity .",
    "we have followed the usual convention to define the @xmath37-axis along the beam direction and the @xmath38-axis in the reaction plane of the collision .",
    "the angles @xmath39 and @xmath20 in the above are the azimuthal angles of the momentum and position vectors of a particle with respect to the @xmath38-axis .",
    "for the longitudinal flow , it is assumed to be boost invariant so that the longitudinal flow rapidity is equal to the energy - momentum rapidity , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "we further assume that the distribution in the energy - momentum rapidity is uniform in the midrapidity .    because of non - vanishing elliptic flow @xmath4 in non - central heavy ion collisions , which is defined as @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being , respectively , the projections of the particle transverse momentum along the @xmath38 and @xmath32 axes in the transverse plane , the transverse flow velocity is anisotropic with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath44 .",
    "we thus parameterize the transverse flow velocity as @xmath45 \\hat{\\bm{n } } , \\label{eq : beta}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the unit vector in the direction of their transverse flow velocity @xmath47 , which is taken to be normal to the surface of the hadronic system to be defined below .",
    "we have also introduced a @xmath5-dependent coefficient @xmath48 to model the saturation of the resulting @xmath4 at large @xmath5 as observed in experiments .",
    "specifically , we parameterize @xmath48 as @xmath49 we further parameterize the radial flow velocity as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a parameter related to the transverse size of the initial hadron distribution in space and @xmath52 is the distance of the particle from the origin of the coordinate system in the transverse plane .    for the spatial distribution of the particles produced at hadronization , it is assumed to be inside a cylinder with its axis along the longitudinal direction and having an elliptic shape in the transverse plane , as only minimum biased collisions are considered in the present study .",
    "these particles are further assumed to be uniformly distributed in the transverse plane .",
    "this means that the initial hadrons are uniformly distributed in the spatial region of @xmath53 in terms of the spatial elliptic anisotropy  @xcite @xmath54 the spatial region as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ellipse1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath55,\\ ] ] leading to @xmath56 for the coordinate system defined above , the initial shape of the hadronic system in non - central collisions then has @xmath57 .",
    "we further introduce a formation time @xmath58 for hadrons produced from hadronization as in ref .  @xcite . because of boost invariance , the time and the position in @xmath37-direction of an initial hadron are given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath32 stands for rapidity .",
    "since we do not consider the dynamics of partons in qgp before hadronization , the number of hadrons in the initial state can not be determined a priori .",
    "we thus treat the initial number of positively charged pions @xmath61 as a free parameter so that its number after hadronic rescattering is fitted to the measured pion multiplicity .",
    "the number of other hadrons after hadronization is then determined from the assumption that they are in thermal and relative chemical equilibrium with respect to pions .    for au@xmath62au collisions at center of mass energy @xmath3  gev ,",
    "the parameters for the initial conditions are taken as follows .",
    "for the spatial distribution of initial hadrons , we use the parameters @xmath63 similar to the quark distributions obtained in the ampt model at hadronization . for the transverse momentum distribution",
    ", we use the critical temperature @xmath64  mev and @xmath65 for the flow velocity parameterized in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "the number of initial positively charged pions is taken to be @xmath66 .",
    "this then leads to a proton number of @xmath67 in the thermal model with zero charge and baryon chemical potentials .",
    "these pions and protons as well as other hadrons are then uniformly distributed in the rapidity region @xmath68 .",
    "the resulting initial transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flows of midrapidity ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 s and protons , whose numbers are 71 and 6.4 , respectively after including those from decays of meson and baryon resonances , are shown in figs .  [ fig : pt - all ] and [ fig : v2-all ] . these results will be compared in the next section with those of the freeze - out pions and protons after hadronic scattering .",

    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt - all ] by the dashed and solid lines for pions and protons , respectively , and they are comparable to the experimental data measured by the phenix collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the final pion and proton transverse momentum spectra are not very different from the initial ones shown by the dotted and dash - dotted lines , respectively .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the effect of decreasing temperature of the hadronic matter due to expansion is compensated by an increase in the collective flow velocity .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effect of hadronic rescattering was studied through the hadronic transport model jam  @xcite .",
    "we note that the number of pions and protons in midrapidity after hadronic rescattering are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , including those from decays of baryon and meson resonances , and are only slightly different from their initial values .     of pions and protons for rapidities @xmath71 .",

    "[ fig : v2-all ] , the elliptic flow @xmath4 of pions and protons are shown by solid lines as functions of transverse momentum .",
    "it is seen that our model describes reasonably the experimental data from the phenix collaboration except for @xmath74  gev@xmath7 , where it overestimates the measured pion elliptic flow .",
    "we have found that it is very difficult to find the parameters used for the elliptic flow in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) that would describe both the pion and proton @xmath4 in all @xmath5 region .",
    "this may not be surprising as the pion and proton elliptic flow at high @xmath5 follow the quark number scaling and are thus unlikely to be described by the blast wave model . to overcome",
    "this may require the use of the blast wave model for the quark distributions and the quark coalescence model to generate the initial meson and baryon distributions .",
    "in contrast to the transverse momentum spectra , the final pion and proton elliptic flows are different from the initial ones shown by dashed lines .",
    "one sees that the pion elliptic flow is increased by scattering . for protons , their elliptic flow after scattering also increases at large @xmath5 but becomes smaller at low @xmath5 , reflecting an enhanced mass - ordering effect as a result of increasing radial flow .",
    "in this section , we study the @xmath5 spectrum of deuterons and their elliptic flow . as for other hadrons , we have assumed that they are initially produced at hadronization and then undergo hadronic scattering through which they can be annihilated and also reproduced . to include these effects ,",

    "we first note that the deuteron elliptic flow from the initial blast wave model shown by the dashed line does have small negative values at very low @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to following combined effects .",
    "because of the larger flow velocity in the reaction plane than out of the reaction plane , deuterons of a given transverse momentum @xmath5 in the fire - cylinder frame have a smaller transverse momentum in the local frame if they move in the reaction plane than if they move out of the reaction plane .",
    "since the number of deuterons with transverse momentum @xmath77 in the local frame is proportional to @xmath78 , it is an increasing or decreasing function of @xmath77 for @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "while the resulting deuteron @xmath4 is positive in the latter case as there are more deuterons of transverse momentum @xmath5 moving in the reaction plane than moving out of the reaction plane , it is negative in the former case .",
    "this effect is , however , reduced during subsequent hadronic scattering as a result of increasing radial flow velocity and additional production of deuterons .",

    "we have examined the distribution of the deuteron emission times , which are the times for their last collisions in the transport model , and the results are shown in fig .  [",

    "we note that the non - smooth deuteron early emission time distribution in the transport model is due to the incomplete destruction of initial deuterons , particularly those produced near the surface of the fire cylinder . introducing a diffused hadron distribution in the initial state may help smooth the deuteron emission time distribution during earlier times .",

    "[ fig : scaling ] for the elliptic flow per nucleon as a function of momentum per nucleon [ panel ( a ) ] or as a function of transverse kinetic energy [ @xmath102 per nucleon [ panel ( b ) ] .",

    "we have also compared our transport model results with those of the coalescence model .",
    "while the two give very similar deuteron @xmath5 spectra , the elliptic flows obtained in the two model are quite different , particularly at high @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the coalescence model is found to give almost exact nucleon number scaling of the elliptic flow , while the transport model causes a deviation of the elliptic flow from the exact nucleon number scaling , which is , however , closer to the measured data .",
    "these results , including the non - negative values of the elliptic flow at very small @xmath5 , are not much changed if the cross sections for deuteron production and scattering are changed by a factor of two .",
    "our study has raised two interesting questions on deuteron production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "one is the relation between the transport model and the coalescence model for deuteron production , and the other concerns the negative deuteron elliptic flow at low @xmath5 .",
    "since the binding energy of deuteron is small ( @xmath105  mev ) , the coalescence model has been considered an appropriate approach to describe deuteron production in nuclear reactions  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case in our study for the deuteron transverse momentum spectrum as the two models give very similar results .",
    "however , the deuteron elliptic flows from these two models are quite different , with the transport model giving a better description of the experimental data in comparison with the coalescence model .",
    "part of this difference may be due to the neglect of rescattering of deuterons produced in the coalescence model .",
    "although deuterons are produced from freeze - out nucleons in the coalescence model , they may undergo additional scattering in the hadronic matte , leading to a later emission time as results from the transport model have shown .",
    "as to the negative deuteron elliptic flow observed in the preliminary experimental data , it is not seen in either the transport model or the coalescence model .",
    "the lack of negative deuteron elliptic flow in the coalescence model is expected as a negative deuteron elliptic flow requires a negative nucleon elliptic flow , which is not observed in the experimental data . in the transport model ,",
    "a negative deuteron elliptic flow is possible if the final radial flow velocity is smaller than that reached in the present study , following the discussions in the end of section  [ sec : deuteron1 ] . whether this can still lead to a good description of the measured deuteron transverse momentum spectrum",

    "<S> the hadronic transport model art is extended to include the production and annihilation of deuterons via the reactions @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 stand for baryons and mesons , respectively , as well as their elastic scattering with mesons and baryons in the hadronic matter . </S>",
    "<S> this new hadronic transport model is then used to study the transverse momentum spectrum and elliptic flow of deuterons in relativistic heavy ion collisions , with the initial hadron distributions after hadronization of produced quark - gluon plasma taken from a blast wave model . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with those measured by the phenix and star collaborations for au+au collisions at @xmath3  gev , and also with those obtained from the coalescence model based on freeze - out nucleons in the transport model . </S>"
