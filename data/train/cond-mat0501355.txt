    "the understanding of protein folding is one of the most challenging objectives in biochemically motivated research .",
    "although the physical principles are known , the complexity of proteins as being macromolecules consisting of numerous atoms , the influence of quantum chemical details on long - range interactions as well as the role of the solvent , etc .",
    ", makes an accurate analysis of the folding process of realistic proteins extremely difficult .",
    "therefore , one of the most important questions in this field is how much detailed information can be neglected to establish effective , coarse - grained models yielding reasonable , at least qualitative , results that allow for , e.g. , a more global view on the relationship between the sequence of amino acid residues and the existence of a global , funnel - like energy minimum in a rugged free - energy landscape  @xcite .    within the past two decades",
    "much work has been devoted to introduce minimalistic models based on general principles that are believed to primarily control the structure formation of proteins .",
    "one of the most prominent examples is the hp model of lattice proteins  @xcite which has been exhaustively investigated without revealing all secrets , despite its simplicity . in this model ,",
    "only two types of monomers are considered , with hydrophobic ( @xmath0 ) and polar ( @xmath1 ) character .",
    "chains on the lattice are self - avoiding to account for the excluded volume .",
    "the only explicit interaction is between non - adjacent but next - neighbored hydrophobic monomers .",
    "this interaction of hydrophobic contacts is attractive to force the formation of a compact hydrophobic core which is screened from the ( hypothetic ) aqueous environment by the polar residues .",
    "statistical mechanics simulations of this model are still subject of studies requiring the application of sophisticated algorithms  @xcite .",
    "a manifest off - lattice generalisation of the hp model is the ab model  @xcite , where the hydrophobic monomers are labelled by @xmath2 and the polar or hydrophilic ones by @xmath3 .",
    "the contact interaction is replaced by a distance - dependent lennard - jones type of potential accounting for short - range excluded volume repulsion and long - range interaction , the latter being attractive for @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairs and repulsive for @xmath6 pairs of monomers .",
    "an additional interaction accounts for the bending energy of any pair of successive bonds .",
    "this model was first applied in two dimensions  @xcite and generalized to three - dimensional ab proteins  @xcite , partially with modifications taking implicitly into account additional torsional energy contributions of each bond .",
    "more knowledge - based coarse - grained models are often of g type , where , in the simplest lattice formulation , the energy is proportional to the negative number of native contacts .",
    "these models usually require the knowledge of the native conformation and serve , e.g. , as models for studies of folding pathways  @xcite and native topology  @xcite .",
    "there is also growing interest in modeling the folding behavior of single - domain proteins with simplified models as many of them show up a simple two - state kinetics  @xcite without intermediary states that would slow down the folding dynamics ( `` traps '' ) .",
    "it seems , however , that native - centric models such as those of g type require modifications for a qualitatively correct description of this sharp folding transition  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report studies of thermodynamic and ground - state properties of ab sequences known from the literature  @xcite for two representations of the ab model  @xcite which are described in sec .",
    "[ models ] . while , compared to all - atom formulations , the interactions in these coarse - grained models are greatly simplified and hence can be computed much faster , they still preserve a complicated rugged free - energy landscape , where naive simulations would easily get trapped . in order to accurately resolve the low - temperature behavior we , therefore , applied a multicanonical monte carlo algorithm  @xcite with an appropriate update mechanism . for simulations of systems with complex free energy landscapes ,",
    "multicanonical sampling has become very popular and its application in protein simulations has a long tradition  @xcite .",

    "the paper is concluded by the summary in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "we investigated two effective off - lattice models of ab type for heteropolymers with @xmath7 monomers .",
    "the first one is the original ab model as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the energy function @xmath8 where the first sum runs over the @xmath9 angles @xmath10 of successive bond vectors .",
    "this term is the bending energy and the coupling is `` ferromagnetic '' , i.e. , it costs energy to bend the chain .",
    "the second term partially competes with the bending barrier by a potential of lennard - jones type depending on the distance between monomers being non - adjacent along the chain .",
    "it also accounts for the influence of the ab sequence ( @xmath11 for hydrophobic and @xmath12 for hydrophilic monomers ) on the energy of a conformation as its long - range behavior is attractive for pairs of like monomers and repulsive for @xmath6 pairs of monomers : @xmath13 we will refer to this model as ab model i throughout the paper .    the other model we have studied has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is a variant of ab model i in that it also consists of angular and distance - dependent energy terms , but with some substantial modifications . in the following ,",
    "we denote it as ab model ii .",
    "the energy is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bond vector between the monomers @xmath16 and @xmath17 with length unity . in ref .",
    "@xcite different values for the parameter set ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) were tested and finally set to ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) as this choice led to distributions for the angles between bond vectors @xmath15 and @xmath22 as well as the torsion angles between the surface vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 that agreed best with distributions obtained for selected functional proteins . since @xmath25 , the choice @xmath26 makes the coupling between successive bonds `` antiferromagnetic '' or `` antibending '' contrary to what was chosen in eq .",
    "( [ stillinger ] ) for ab model i. the second term in eq .",
    "( [ irbaeck ] ) takes torsional interactions into account without being an energy associated with the pure torsional barriers in the usual sense .",
    "the third term contains now a pure lennard - jones potential , where the @xmath27 long - range interaction is attractive whatever types of monomers interact .",
    "the monomer - specific prefactor @xmath28 only controls the depth of the lennard - jones valley : @xmath29 for technical reasons , we have introduced in both models a cut - off @xmath30 for the lennard - jones potentials below which the potential is hard - core repulsive ( i.e. , the potential is infinite ) . for both models",
    "only a few results are given in the literature .",
    "for the first model these are estimates for the global energy minima of certain ab sequences  @xcite , while for ab model ii primarily thermodynamic quantities were determined  @xcite .",
    "we have performed elp optimizations  @xcite in order to find deeper - lying energy minima than the values quoted and , in particular , multicanonical sampling  @xcite for enabling us to focus on thermodynamic properties of the sequences given in ref .",
    "in this section we describe the computational sampling methods and the update procedure we applied to obtain results for off - lattice ab heteropolymers .      in order to locate global energy minima of a complex system ,",
    "it is often useful to apply specially biased algorithms that only serve this purpose .",
    "we used the energy landscape paving ( elp ) minimizer  @xcite to find global energy minima of the sequences under consideration .",
    "the elp minimization is a monte carlo optimization method , where the energy landscape is locally flattened .",
    "this means that if a state @xmath31 with energy @xmath32 is hit , the energy is increased by a `` penalty '' which itself depends on the histogram of any suitably chosen order parameter .",
    "the simplest choice is the energy distribution @xmath33 such that we define @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the boltzmann probability @xmath35 for a metropolis update , where @xmath36 is the thermal energy at the temperature @xmath37 , becomes a function of `` time '' @xmath38 .",
    "the advantage of this method is that local energy minima are filled up and the likelihood of touching again recently visited regions decreases .",
    "this method has successfully proved to be applicable to find global energy minima in rough energy landscapes of proteins  @xcite . of course , as a consequence of the biased sampling , stochastic methods along the line of elp violate detailed balance and it is therefore inappropriate to apply those for uncovering thermodynamic properties of a statistical system .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our primary interest of this study is focussed on thermodynamic properties of heteropolymers , in particular on conformational transitions heteropolymers pass from random coils to native conformations with compact hydrophobic core .",
    "we investigated six heteropolymers with 20 monomers as studied by irbck _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite with ab model ii .",
    "the associated sequences are listed in table  [ tabseq ] .",
    "notice that the hydrophobicity ( @xmath39 monomers in the sequence ) is identical ( @xmath40 ) for the first four sequences 20.120.4 , while sequences 20.5 and 20.6 possess only 10 hydrophobic residues . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the thermodynamic behavior of these sequences was studied by means of the simulated tempering method . for revealing low - temperature properties ,",
    "an additional quenching procedure was performed . in our simulations",
    ", we used multicanonical sampling over the entire range of temperatures without any additional quenching .",
    "as described in sec .  [ gem ] , the multicanonical method is capable to find even the lowest - energy states without any biasing or quenching .",
    "we proved this also for the 20mers of table  [ tabseq ] by comparing once more with the elp minimization method . in tables",
    "[ tabtherm1 ] and  [ tabtherm2 ] we present the estimates of the global energy minima in both models we found in these simulations .",
    "once more , the values obtained with multicanonical sampling agree pretty well with those from elp minimization .",
    "the respective structural coincidences are confirmed by the values for the rmsd and the overlap also being given in these tables . in order to identify conformational transitions , we calculated the specific heat @xmath41 with @xmath42 from the density of states @xmath43 .",
    "the density of states was found ( up to an unimportant overall normalization constant ) by reweighting the multicanonical energy distribution obtained with multicanonical sampling to the canonical distribution @xmath44 at infinite temperature ( @xmath45 ) , since @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ ge20.2 ] shows , as an example , the density of states @xmath43 ( normalized to unity ) and the multicanonical histogram for sequence 20.1 simulated with ab model ii .",
    "we sampled conformations with energy values lying in the interval @xmath47 $ ] , discretized in bins of size @xmath48 , and required the multicanonical histogram to be flat for at least 70% of the core of this interval , i.e. , within the energy range @xmath49 $ ] . within and partly beyond this region",
    ", we achieved almost perfect flatness , i.e. , the ratios between the mean and maximal histogram value , @xmath50 , as well as the ratio between minimum and mean , @xmath51 , exceeded @xmath52 .",
    "as a consequence of this high - accurate sampling of the energy space this enabled us to calculate the density of states very precisely over about 70 orders of magnitude .",
    "the energy scale is , of course , bounded from below by the ground - state energy @xmath53 , and that we closely approximated this value can be seen by the strong decrease of the logarithm of the density of states for the lowest energies .",
    "this strong decrease of the density of states curves near the ground - state energy is common to all short heteropolymer sequences studied .",
    "it reflects the isolated character of the ground state within the energy landscape .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 17.6 cm    = 8.8 cm    = 8.8 cm    we used the density of states to calculate the specific heats of the 20mers in both models .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figc20 ] .",
    "a first observation is that the specific heats obtained from simulations of ab model i show up two distinct peaks with the low - temperature peak located at @xmath54 and the high - temperature peak at @xmath55 compiled in table  [ tabtherm1 ] .",
    "the ab model ii , on the other hand , favors only one pronounced peak at @xmath56 with a long - range high - temperature tail . in table",
    "[ tabtherm2 ] we compare our peak temperatures @xmath56 with the values given in ref .",
    "they are in good correspondence .",
    "the sequences considered here are very short and the native fold contains a single hydrophobic core . interpreting the curves for the specific heats in fig .",
    "[ figc20 ] in terms of conformational transitions , we conclude that the heteropolymers simulated with ab model i tend to form , within the temperature region @xmath57 , intermediate states ( often also called traps ) comparable with globules in the collapsed phase of polymers . for sequences 20.5 and ,",
    "in particular , 20.6 the smaller number of hydrophobic monomers causes a much sharper transition at @xmath55 than at @xmath54 ( where , in fact , the specific heat of sequence 20.6 possesses only a turning point ) .",
    "the pronounced transition near @xmath55 is connected with a dramatic change of the radius of gyration , as can be seen later in fig .",
    "[ figrgyr20 ] , indicating the collapse from stretched to highly compact conformations with decreasing temperature .",
    "the conformations dominant for high temperatures @xmath58 are random coils , while for temperatures @xmath59 primarily conformations with compact hydrophobic core are favored .",
    "the intermediary globular `` phase '' is not at all present for the exemplified sequences when modeled with ab model ii , where only the latter two `` phases '' can be distinguished .",
    "we have to remark that what we denote `` phases '' are not phases in the strict thermodynamic sense , since for heteropolymers of the type we used in this study ( this means we are not focussed on sequences that have special symmetries , as for example diblock copolymers a@xmath60b@xmath61 ) , a thermodynamic limit is _ in principle _ nonsensical . therefore conformational transitions of heteropolymers are not true phase transitions . as a consequence ,",
    "fluctuating quantities , for example the derivatives with respect to the temperature of the mean radius of gyration , @xmath62 , and the mean end - to - end distance , @xmath63 , do not indicate conformational activity at the same temperatures , as well as when compared with the specific heat .",
    "we conclude that conformational transitions of heteropolymers happen within a certain interval of temperatures , not at a fixed critical temperature .",
    "this is a typical finite - size effect and , for this reason , the peak temperatures @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( for model i ) and @xmath56 ( for model ii ) defined above for the specific heat are only representatives for the entire intervals . in order to make this more explicit , we consider sequence 20.3 in more detail . in figs .",
    "[ fl20.4](a ) ( for ab model i ) and [ fl20.4](b ) ( ab model",
    "ii ) , we compare the energetic fluctuations ( in form of the specific heat @xmath64 ) with the respective fluctuations of radius of gyration and end - to - end distance , @xmath65 . obviously , the temperatures with maximal fluctuations are not identical and the shaded areas are spanned over the temperature intervals , where strongest activity is expected .",
    "we observe for this example that in model i ( fig .",
    "[ fl20.4](a ) ) two such centers of activity can be separated linked by an intermediary interval of globular traps .",
    "in fact , there is a minimum of the specific heat at @xmath66 between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , but the increase of internal energy by forming these states , which is given by @xmath67 , is rather small and the globules are not very stable . from fig .",
    "[ fl20.4](b ) , we conclude for this sequence that in model ii no peculiar intermediary conformations occur , and the folding of the heteropolymer is a one - step process .    it is widely believed and experimentally consolidated that realistic short single - domain proteins are usually two - state folders  @xcite .",
    "this means , there is only one folding transition and the protein is either in the folded or an unfolded ( or denatured ) state .",
    "therefore , ab model ii could indeed serve as a simple effective model for two - state heteropolymers .",
    "the main difference between both models under study is that model ii contains an implicit torsional energy which is not present in model i. this is in correspondence with more knowledge - based g - like models with explicit torsional energy contributions for the study of small proteins with known typical two - state folding  unfolding kinetics  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , there are also examples of small peptides exhibiting two clear peaks in the specific heat . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the artificial peptide ala@xmath68gly@xmath69ala@xmath68 was studied in detail and it turned out that two transitions separate the ground - state conformation and random coil states .",
    "one is the alanine mediated helix - coil transition and the second the formation of a glycine hairpin that leads to a more compact conformation .",
    "= 8.8 cm    it is also interesting to compare the thermodynamic behavior of the heteropolymers with 20 monomers as described in the previous section with the homopolymer consisting of 20 @xmath2-type monomers , @xmath70 .",
    "this is the consequent off - lattice generalisation of self - avoiding interacting walks on the lattice ( isaw ) that have been extensively studied over the past decades .",
    "in contrast to heteropolymers , where , because of the associated sequence of finite length , a thermodynamic limit does not exist , homopolymers show up a characteristic second - order phase transition between random coil conformations ( `` good solvent '' ) and compact globules ( `` poor solvent '' ) , the so - called @xmath71 transition  @xcite .    in this study",
    ", our interest was not focussed on the @xmath71 transition but more on the direct comparison of the finite - size homopolymer and the different heteropolymer sequences . in fig .",
    "[ figaac20 ] we have plotted the specific heats of this homopolymer for both models under study .",
    "the first observation is that , independent of the model , the collapse from random coils ( high temperatures ) to globular conformations ( low temperatures ) happens , roughly , in one step .",
    "there is only one energetic barrier as indicated by the single peak of the specific heats .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 8.8 cm    in fig .",
    "[ figrgyr20 ] we have plotted for both models the mean radii of gyration as a function of the temperature for the sequences from table  [ tabseq ] in comparison with the homopolymer . for all temperatures in the interval plotted , the homopolymer obviously takes more compact conformations than the heteropolymers , since its mean radius of gyration is always smaller .",
    "this different behavior is an indication for a rearrangement of the monomers that is particular for heteropolymers : the formation of the hydrophobic core surrounded by the hydrophilic monomers .",
    "since the homopolymer trivially also takes in the ground state a hydrophobic core conformation ( since it only consists of hydrophobic monomers ) , which is obviously more compact than the complete conformations of the heteropolymers , we conclude that hydrophobic monomers weaken the compactness of low - temperature conformations .",
    "thus , homopolymers and heteropolymers show a different `` phase '' behavior in the dense phase .",
    "homopolymers fold into globular conformations which are hydrophobic cores with maximum number of hydrophobic contacts .",
    "heteropolymers also form very compact hydrophobic cores which are , of course , smaller than that of the homopolymer due to the smaller number of hydrophobic monomers in the sequence . in total , however , heteropolymers are less compact than homopolymers because the hydrophilic monomers are pushed off the core and arrange themselves in a shell around the hydrophobic core . for model i , we also see in fig .",
    "[ figrgyr20](a ) a clear tendency that the mean radius of gyration and thus the compactness strongly depends on the hydrophobicity of the sequence , i.e. , the number of hydrophobic monomers .",
    "the curves for sequences 20.5 and 20.6 ( long - dashed curves ) with 10 @xmath2 s in the sequence can clearly be separated from the other heteropolymers in the study ( with 14 hydrophobic monomers ) and the homopolymer .",
    "this supports the assumption that for heteropolymers the formation of a hydrophobic core is more favorable than the folding into an entire maximally compact conformation .",
    "we have investigated two coarse - grained off - lattice heteropolymer models of ab type that mainly differ in the modelling of energetic bending and torsional barriers . while the original ab model ( model i )  @xcite , which was first introduced for two - dimensional heteropolymers , treats the polymer as a stiff chain of hydrophobic ( @xmath2 ) and hydrophilic ( @xmath3 ) monomers without considering torsional barriers , model ii favors bending and an additional contribution containing also torsional energy is regarded  @xcite .",
    "another noticeable property of model i is that contacts between @xmath2 and @xmath3 monomers are always suppressed , in contrast to model ii .",
    "we studied these models by means of the multicanonical monte carlo method . in a first test",
    ", we checked the ability of the algorithm to find lowest - energy conformations .",
    "the results were compared with minimum energy values obtained with the energy - landscape paving ( elp ) algorithm by measuring the rmsd and a generalized overlap parameter that in addition to torsional degrees of freedom also allows the comparison of bond angles .",
    "we found very good coincidences for minimum energies and associated conformations for all sequences under study , with the exception of the 34mer in model ii and the 55mer in both models . in the latter case",
    "the random walk in the energy space , which is considered as the system parameter , in not sufficient to find the global energy minimum and a more detailed study of the origin of the free energy barriers , i.e. , the identification of an appropriate order parameter , is required .",
    "nonetheless , for all sequences we obtained much lower values for the respective putative global - energy minimum than formerly quoted in the literature using an off - lattice chain - growth algorithm  @xcite and also considerably lower values than with the annealing contour monte carlo ( acmc ) method  @xcite .",
    "our main objective was the comparison of the conformational transitions in both models .",
    "we primarily studied energetic and conformational fluctuations of several sequences with 20 monomers and found that in model i there is a general tendency that , independent of the sequence , the folding from random coils ( high temperatures ) to lowest - energy conformations is a two - step process and the folding is slowed down by weakly stable intermediary conformations .",
    "this is different in model ii , were traps are avoided and the heteropolymers exhibit a two - state folding behavior .",
    "this is ( qualitatively ! ) in correspondence with the observation that many short peptides seem to possess a rather smooth free - energy landscape , where only a single barrier separates unfolded states and native fold  @xcite .",
    "most of the previous investigations in this regard were performed by means of a kind of knowledge - based potentials , where topological properties ( e.g. , the native contacts ) of the folded state explicitly enter .",
    "these potentials allow then quantitative studies of the dynamics of the folding process for the specified protein . in our study , however , we were more interested in the influence of basic principles on the folding transition and therefore quantitative comparison with the folding of realistic proteins is not appropriate at this level of abstraction .    in order to reveal folding properties specific to heteropolymers ,",
    "we also compared with a purely hydrophobic polymer .",
    "our results for the homopolymer are in accordance with the widely accepted view of the formation of compact globular conformations below the @xmath71 transition temperature .",
    "the globules , which are in our interpretation only compact hydrophobic cores with maximum number of hydrophobic contacts , minimize the surface exposed to the ( implicit ) solvent .",
    "this behavior was observed for both models which differ , for the purely hydrophobic homopolymer , only in local covalent bond properties , but not in the non - bonded interaction between the monomers .",
    "since heteropolymers with the same chain length contain less hydrophobic monomers , the hydrophobic core is , although still very dense , smaller and the hydrophilic monomers form a shell surrounding the core and screening it from the solvent .",
    "this , in consequence , leads to a native conformation that qualitatively differs from the typical globules known from polymers . in models allowing for intermediary states ( such as model i in our study ) , the globular `` phase '' is actually present for heteropolymers , too , and is dominant in a temperature interval between the hydrophobic - core phase at very low temperatures and the random coils that are present at high temperatures .    in conclusion ,",
    "simple , coarse - grained off - lattice heteropolymer models without specific or knowledge - based parameterization are attractive as they allow for the study of how basic energetic contributions , bonded and non - bonded , in the model are related to and influence the conformational folding process of heteropolymers , respectively .",
    "herein , the main focus is on the study of general properties of these systems . in perspective",
    ", such models , after refinements with respect to a few specific interatomic interactions ( e.g. , hydrogen bonds ) will be suitable for studying heteropolymers of a few hundreds of monomers even quantitatively without the requirement of a prior knowledge of the final fold .",

    "<S> we have performed multicanonical simulations of hydrophobic  hydrophilic heteropolymers with two simple effective , coarse - grained off - lattice models to study the influence of specific interactions in the models on conformational transitions of selected sequences with 20 monomers . </S>",
    "<S> another aspect of the investigation was the comparison with the purely hydrophobic homopolymer and the study of general conformational properties induced by the `` disorder '' in the sequence of a heteropolymer . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we applied an optimization algorithm to sequences with up to 55 monomers and compared the global - energy minimum found with lowest - energy states identified within the multicanonical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this was used to find out how reliable the multicanonical method samples the free - energy landscape , in particular for low temperatures . </S>"
