    "understanding the nature of arrested states of matter such as colloidal gels and glasses has been an active and challenging field of research in recent decades @xcite and is still far from being well - understood .",
    "what makes these ubiquitous soft glassy materials a fascinating subject of study is their complex dynamical behavior that differs from that of equilibrium liquids .",
    "what makes studying their dynamics interesting is the observation of universal dynamical features in different systems , such as molecular , colloidal , metallic and ionic glasses @xcite .",
    "a very important common feature in such glassy materials is a dramatic slowing down of the diffusion of particles or molecules concomitant with a huge increase of viscosity on approaching the glass transition .",
    "the slowing down of dynamics expresses itself as a non - exponential relaxation of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom in supercooled liquids and non - decaying plateaus deep into the glassy phase .",
    "another significant feature is _ aging _ i.e. , the evolution of the physical properties of the system with waiting time , the time elapsed since the quench into glassy phase .",
    "an important question that arises in this respect is how the motion of orientational and translational degrees of freedom are influenced upon the transition from a liquid - like to a disordered solid - like state and if the slowing down of the two degrees of freedom are correlated . in a low - viscosity liquid",
    "far from the supercooled regime , the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of particles follow the stokes - einstein and debye - stokes - einstein equations , respectively , that relate the diffusion coefficients to temperature and viscosity @xcite . according to these relations",
    "the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients are not independent and should both have a linear temperature dependence and be proportional to the inverse of the viscosity .",
    "while there have been some comprehensive studies on rotational motion of several molecular glass formers @xcite , there are fewer studies on rotational dynamics of glassy colloidal systems @xcite . here",
    ", we present the results of a systematic investigation of aging of the translational and rotational diffusion of charged colloidal platelets of laponite studied for a wide range of concentrations and as a function of waiting time .",
    "laponite is a synthetic clay @xcite that is widely used as a rheology - modifier in industrial applications .",
    "laponite particles , when suspended in water , form a suspension that evolves from a low - viscosity water - like liquid to a highly viscoelastic fluid over time @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the suspension exhibits a strong aging behavior and undergoes an ergodic to non - ergodic transition .",
    "this behavior is observed at moderately low volume fractions @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the aging dynamics of translational diffusion and structure factor in both ergodic and non - ergodic regimes have been studied extensively over the past decade @xcite revealing a dramatic slowing down of the translational motion .",
    "interestingly , the intermediate scattering function measurements of laponite suspensions have revealed that low and high concentration samples evolve in a distinctly different manner @xcite .",
    "based on different aging behaviors of the translational diffusion as well as the structure factor , the non - equilibrium states of laponite suspensions in pure water have been identified to be a colloidal gel at low concentrations @xmath1 wt% and a colloidal glass at higher concentrations @xmath2 wt% @xcite .    here , we study the behavior of rotational diffusion when varying the concentration from the gel to the glass region . in prior works",
    "@xcite , we have studied the aging dynamics of rotational diffusion in a colloidal glass of laponite at concentrations around 3 wt % .",
    "we showed that orientational correlation function of the system also shows a non - exponential decay and the rotational relaxation time dramatically slows down during the aging ; this happens at a rate faster than that of translational degree and viscosity . here",
    ", we would like to know how the aging of rotational dynamics is correlated with the translational dynamics during the aging as we vary the concentration and consequently if the rotational dynamics of colloidal gels and glasses can also be classified into two distinct groups ( gels and glasses ) .",
    "to this end , we perform a systematic study of the orientational correlations for a wide range of concentrations .",
    "we observe that the orientational dynamics of both colloidal gels and glasses slows down during the aging .",
    "however the rotational dynamics of colloidal gels and glasses behave distinctly differently , in line with observations for the translational dynamics , thus providing another criterion for discerning the two states .",
    "also we find that in both colloidal gels and glasses , the orientational relaxation time grows at a faster rate than the translational one , suggesting that orientation and translation become decoupled upon approaching the non - ergodic state .",
    "the remainder of paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present the experimental aspects of the sample preparation and dynamic light scattering measurements in section ii .",
    "subsequently , we briefly review , the theory of dynamic light scattering from anisotropic particles in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the results of our measurements on rotational dynamics for colloidal gels and glasses of laponite . in the last section",
    "v , we summarize our main findings and discuss our results in relation to experiments on other glass - forming materials .",
    "the laponite that we used for our experiments is laponite xlg that consists of charged platelets of average diameter of 30 nm and thickness of 1.2 nm @xcite .",
    "laponite can absorb water , increasing its weight up to 20% .",
    "therefore , we first dried it in an oven at @xmath3c for one week and subsequently stored it in a desiccator .",
    "we prepare a number of samples with different concentrations of laponite in pure water .",
    "laponite dispersions are prepared in ultrapure millipore water @xmath4 and are stirred vigorously by a magnetic stirrer for 1.5 h to make sure that the laponite particles are fully dispersed .",
    "the dispersions are filtered using millipore millex aa @xmath5 filter units to obtain a reproducible initial state @xcite .",
    "this instant defines the zero of waiting time , @xmath6 .",
    "our dynamic light scattering setup ( alv ) is based on a he - ne laser ( @xmath7 , 35 mw ) and avalanche photodiodes as detectors .",
    "an alv-60x0 correlator directly computes the intensity correlation functions @xmath8 , at a scattering wave vector @xmath9 , in which @xmath10 is the scattering angle .    in our experiments",
    "the polarization of scattered light is detected in two modes : the vv mode in which the polarization of the incident and scattered light are both vertical and the vh mode in which the polarization of the scattered light is horizontal and perpendicular to the vertical polarization of incoming light . the vv and vh intensity correlation functions were measured at a fixed scattering angle @xmath11 ( @xmath12 m@xmath13 ) regularly at a rate depending on the speed of aging of laponite suspensions .",
    "the anisotropy in shape of particles gives rise to an anisotropic polarizability tensor .",
    "for particles with axial symmetry such as disks and rods , the eigenvectors of polarizability tensor correspond to the directions perpendicular and parallel to the symmetry axis and their resultant eigenvalues are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the total electric field scattered by such particles for linearly polarized incident light in the vertical direction has two components .",
    "the first is the vertically",
    "_ polarized _",
    "component @xmath16 with an amplitude proportional to the average polarizability , @xmath17 .",
    "the second one is the horizontal _ depolarized _",
    "component @xmath18 .",
    "its amplitude is proportional to the intrinsic particle anisotropy @xmath19 , which is the difference between the polarizabilities parallel and perpendicular to the optical axis . in depolarized dynamic light scattering ( ddls ) ,",
    "one measures the correlation functions of the scattered light intensity whose polarization ( horizontal ) is perpendicular to the polarization of incident light ( vertical ) , i.e. @xmath20 , as opposed to the @xmath21 for which the polarization of scattered and incident light are both vertical .",
    "these intensity correlations are related to their corresponding intermediate scattering functions : @xmath22 through the siegert relation , i.e. @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a set - up dependent coherence factor @xcite .",
    "assuming that the suspensions are dilute enough so that orientations and positions of different particles are uncorrelated , one can obtain the vv and vh intermediate scattering functions in terms of the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients and average polarizability @xmath25 and anisotropy of polarizability @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the resulting intermediate scattering functions factorize into a product of a purely local ( not @xmath27-dependent ) orientational correlation and a @xmath27-dependent translational correlation and can be written as @xcite : @xmath28f_{s}(q , t)}{\\gamma^{2}+\\frac{4}{45}\\beta^{2 } } \\\\",

    "the contribution of the rotational motion to the @xmath30 correlation is proportional to @xmath31 , that turned out to be smaller than 0.02 in our experiments .",
    "therefore we can neglect the rotational contribution to @xmath32 in our data .",
    "hence the dynamics of @xmath32 mainly reflects the translational diffusion of the particles , while @xmath33 is determined by both translational and rotational motion .",

    "[ fig7 ] , the rotational diffusion at the early stages of aging is considerably slower in glassy samples and is almost concentration - independent on approaching the non - ergodic state . therefore , one can deduce that in the non - ergodic state the rotational diffusion of both gels and glasses is hindered .",

    "all these findings point to the different mechanisms involved in gel and glass formation .",
    "the enormous slowing down of short - time rotational diffusion in the gel indicates that the rotational motion of particles in a gel becomes very restricted as a result of the formation of small clusters or network - like structures . similarly to the translational degrees of freedom that was reported previously @xcite , the aging dynamics of rotation in colloidal gels and glasses is different .",
    "one can observe two distinct routes of evolution for the rotational dynamics , providing us with another criterion @xciteto distinguish colloidal gels ( low concentrations ) and glasses ( high concentrations ) .",
    "the faster rate of slowing down of rotational motion compared to that of translation in both colloidal gels and glasses , points to a decoupling of translational and rotational motion during the aging of colloidal gels and glasses and is usually interpreted in terms of dynamical heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "the non - exponential behavior of both translational and orientational correlations and their description by a stretched rather than a simple exponential also points to a broad distribution of relaxation times , as thus also heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "our data also suggest that the decoupling is stronger in spatially heterogeneous samples ( gels ) than the spatially homogeneous ones ( glasses ) , as the the difference in the aging behavior of rotational and translational degrees of freedom is more pronounced in gels .",
