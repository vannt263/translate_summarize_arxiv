    "in the present paper we consider a model where in a prescribed region @xmath0 of the euclidean space @xmath8 an agent ( a central government or a commercial company ) has the possibility to decide the price of a certain product ; this price @xmath1 may vary at each point @xmath2 and the customers density @xmath9 is assumed to be completely known .",
    "we assume that all the customers buy the same quantity of the product ; on the counterpart , a customer living at the point @xmath2 knows the pricing function @xmath3 everywhere and may decide to buy the product where he lives , then paying a cost @xmath1 , or in another place @xmath4 , then paying the cost @xmath5 and additionally a transportation cost @xmath6 for a given transportation cost function @xmath7 .",
    "the individual strategy of each customer is then to solve the minimization problem @xmath10    of particular importance to our problem is the ( set - valued ) map @xmath11 which associates to every customer living at the point @xmath12 all the locations where it is optimal to purchase the good . given the price pattern @xmath3 , @xmath13 is then defined by @xmath14    without any other constraint , due to the fact that the customers have to buy the product ( for instance gasoline , food , a medical product or cigarettes ) , the pricing strategy for the agent in order to maximize the total income would simply be increasing everywhere the function @xmath3 more and more . to avoid this trivial strategy",
    "we assume that on the region @xmath0 some kind of regulations are present , and we study the optimization problems the agent has to solve in order to maximize its total profit .",
    "we will study two models according to two different price constraints .",
    "we also assume that the supply is unconstrained at any location of the region @xmath0 , which means that whatever the total demand for the product is at a given location , it can be supplied by the agent to the customers .",
    "the simplest situation we consider is when the price @xmath1 is constrained to remain below a fixed bound @xmath15 everywhere on @xmath0 , due for instance to some regulatory policy .",
    "the only assumption we make is that @xmath16 is a _ proper _ nonnegative function , intending that in the region where @xmath17 no restrictions on @xmath1 are imposed .",
    "the goal of the agent is to maximize its total income that , with the notation introduced in and , can be written as @xmath18 under the constraint ( state equation ) that @xmath19 i.e. that @xmath20 is compatible with the customer s individual minimization problem .",
    "one may therefore see the previous program as a nonstandard optimal control problem where @xmath3 is the control and @xmath20 the state variable .",
    "let us mention that problems with a similar structure naturally arise in the so - called _ principal - agent _ problem in economics ( see for instance rochet and chon @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we consider a second model of pricing strategy : we suppose that in @xmath0 there is a given subregion @xmath21 where the price @xmath1 is fixed as a function @xmath15 that the agent can not control .",
    "this is for instance the case of another country if the agent represents a central government , or of a region where for some social reasons that the agent can not modify , the prices of the product are fixed .",
    "whenever @xmath22 , then the agent makes no benefit from customers living at @xmath12 .",
    "in fact the total profit of the agent is given by @xmath23 under the constraint ( state equation ) that @xmath19 .",
    "note that in formula giving the total profit , the integration is now performed only on the set of customers that do shop in the region controlled by the agent and not in the fixed - price region @xmath21 .",
    "the problem we are interested in reads again as the maximization of the functional @xmath24 among the admissible choices of state and control variables .    for both models",
    "above we discuss the mathematical framework which enables us to obtain an existence result for an optimal pricing strategy and we present some particular cases where more detailed computations can be made , as the case of concave costs , the case of a quadratic cost , and the onedimensional case .",
    "the last section contains some discussions about possible extensions and developments , as for instance the case of nash equilibria when more agents operate on the same market .",
    "in what follows , @xmath0 will be some compact metric space ( the economic region ) , and @xmath25 $ ] a nonnegative proper function , i.e. we assume that @xmath16 is not @xmath26 everywhere on @xmath0 .",
    "we are also given a transportation cost function @xmath7 assumed to be continuous and nonnegative on @xmath27 and such that @xmath28 for all @xmath2 .",
    "finally , @xmath29 is a nonnegative radon measure on @xmath0 that models the distribution of customers in @xmath0 .",
    "the unknown of the problem is the pricing pattern @xmath3 that varies in the class @xmath30 once a price @xmath3 has been chosen by the agent , consumers living at any point @xmath2 purchase the good so as to minimize their total expenditure which is given by price plus commuting cost .",
    "this leads to the following definitions : @xmath31 by our l.s.c .",
    "and compactness assumptions , @xmath32 is a nonempty compact subset of @xmath0 ( but @xmath13 is not single - valued in general ) ; moreover the graph of @xmath13 is compact as the @xmath33 of some l.s.c .",

    "note that @xmath32 is the set of locations where consumers living at @xmath12 rationally choose to purchase the good .",

    "a function @xmath190 is called @xmath191-concave if there exists a function @xmath192 bounded from above such that @xmath193    if @xmath127 is @xmath191-concave there exists a kind of minimal representation ( as for the usual legendre - fenchel transform ) of @xmath127 in the form ( [ defccon ] ) . indeed , using the @xmath7-transform ( see definition [ cconc ] ) @xmath194 one has @xmath195 indeed , on the one hand , the definition of @xmath196 yields @xmath197 for every @xmath198 , hence : @xmath199 on the other hand , using the representation ( [ defccon ] ) yields @xmath200 on @xmath189 hence @xmath201 analogously to what was done in section [ firstpb ] , for every @xmath191-concave function @xmath127 , the @xmath191-superdifferential of @xmath127 at @xmath2 ( denoted @xmath202 ) is defined by @xmath203 since @xmath0 and @xmath189 are compact and @xmath191-concave functions and their @xmath7-transforms are continuous , it is easy to see that for every @xmath191-concave function @xmath127 and every @xmath2 , @xmath202 is a nonempty compact subset of @xmath189 and that @xmath204 is compact .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to reformulate the maximization problem ( [ pbmeenp ] ) in terms of @xmath205 only .",
    "let @xmath181 be nonnegative ( which is not restrictive in view of remark [ rk1 ] ) and write @xmath206 with @xmath205 and @xmath207 defined by ( [ defwp ] ) .",
    "then , let us define @xmath208 as already noticed , since @xmath205 is @xmath191-concave we have @xmath209 now let us define @xmath210 by construction @xmath211 hence @xmath212 . the next proposition expresses that the profit is improved when one replaces @xmath3 by @xmath213 .",
    "this allows us to restrict the analysis to prices that are ( up to a minus sign ) a @xmath7-transform on the free region @xmath189 and will enable us to express the problem in terms of @xmath127 only .",

    "let @xmath96 , @xmath214 and let @xmath213 and @xmath127 be defined as above .",
    "then one has @xmath215 which imply @xmath216 and @xmath217    we already know that @xmath212 . using subsection [ gc ] we know that @xmath218 on @xmath189 . since @xmath214 and @xmath219 we have @xmath220 which proves @xmath221 and ( [ prop1re ] ) .",
    "now , fix @xmath162 and @xmath172 ; then @xmath222 which , since @xmath223 , implies that @xmath224 so that @xmath225 which proves ( [ prop2re ] ) .",
    "the previous argument also proves that @xmath226 .",
    "the fact that @xmath227 and ( [ prop4re ] ) are obvious .",
    "thanks to the fact that @xmath228 , the integrand in @xmath229 is nonnegative and thanks to ( [ prop2re ] ) we obtain @xmath230 on @xmath169 . by ( [ prop3re ] )",
    "we then have : @xmath231 finally , thanks to ( [ prop3re ] ) and ( [ prop4re ] ) , @xmath229 can be rewritten as a function of @xmath127 only as in ( [ paw ] ) .",
    "proposition [ reformul ] thus enables us to reformulate the initial problem ( [ pbmeenp ] ) as : @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the set of all @xmath191-concave functions .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath127 solves ( [ pbmeenw ] ) then @xmath213 defined by @xmath210 solves ( [ pbmeenp ] ) .",
    "notice that if @xmath234 then one has for every @xmath235 latexmath:[\\[\\label{equic }    that @xmath233 is an equicontinuous family .      with the reformulation ( [ pbmeenw ] ) ( and the equicontinuity estimate ( [ equic ] ) ) at hand",
    ", we easily deduce the following existence result .",
    "[ exist ] problem ( [ pbmeenw ] ) admits at least one solution ( hence so does problem ( [ pbmeenp ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath237 be some maximizing sequence of ( [ pbmeenw ] ) ; without loss of generality we may assume that the integrand in the definition of @xmath238 is nonnegative ( see remark [ rk1 ] ) and that @xmath239 .",
    "by ( [ equic ] ) we deduce that @xmath240 is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous .",
    "thanks to ascoli - arzela s theorem , passing to a subsequence if necessary we may assume that @xmath241 converges uniformly to some @xmath127 which is easily seen to be @xmath191-concave too . to prove that @xmath127 solves ( [ pbmeenw ] ) , we first use fatou s lemma : @xmath242 it is therefore enough to prove that for every @xmath2    @xmath243    if @xmath244 the right - hand side vanishes and , since @xmath245 uniformly , we have @xmath246 for @xmath247 large enough , so that the left - hand side vanishes too .",
    "assume now that @xmath248 , and let @xmath249 be such that @xmath250 passing to a subsequence if necessary we may assume that @xmath251 converges to some @xmath252 , hence ( [ scsx ] ) holds .",
    "in this section we propose some further developments of the optimization problems above that could be investigated .",
    "it is not our goal to enter into the details , which could possibly be treated in a future paper .",
    "the model problems considered in the previous sections could also be used to describe a two ( or more ) players game , where each player operates only on its own region and considers the prices on the other regions as fixed . more precisely ,",
    "assume that @xmath328 where @xmath329 and @xmath330 are two compact sets with no interior point in common ( although this is not essential for what follows ) . on @xmath329 and @xmath330 two agents ( for instance the central governments of two different countries ) operate and initially two price functions @xmath15 and @xmath331 are present on @xmath329 and @xmath330 respectively .",
    "at a first step the agent that operates on @xmath329 modifies its price on @xmath329 considering @xmath332 fixed on @xmath330 and maximizes its income choosing an optimal price function @xmath333 ; then the agent that operates on @xmath330 plays its move considering @xmath333 fixed on @xmath329 and maximizing its income through the choice of an optimal price function @xmath334 .",
    "the game continues in this way then providing price functions @xmath335 and @xmath336 defined on @xmath329 and @xmath330 respectively",
    ".    an interesting issue would be the study of the convergence of the sequences @xmath337 and @xmath338 to price strategies @xmath3 and @xmath339 that the two agents do not have the interest to modify any more .",
    "a related alternative is to consider the competitive problem between the agents operating on @xmath329 and @xmath330 as a two - persons game ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) , which is not zero - sum , where the strategy of each player is the pricing function on the region he controls .",
    "one has to be cautious in precisely defining the payoff functions when some customers are indifferent between being the good in @xmath329 or in @xmath330 .",
    "in such a case , one can for instance impose , as tie - breaking rule , that each customer shops in his own region , and for simplicity we assume @xmath340 .    for respective price strategies @xmath3 ( prices on @xmath329 ) and @xmath339 ( prices on @xmath330 ) , define for all @xmath2 @xmath341 under our tie - breaking rule ,",
    "the payoff functions for the two players are then given by @xmath342 defining admissible strategies as pairs of nonnegative and l.s.c .",
    "functions on @xmath329 and @xmath330 ( possibly also satisfying additional constraints ) , an interesting issue is then to find nash equilibria ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) for the payoffs @xmath343 , that is a pair of admissible strategies @xmath344 and @xmath345 such that @xmath346 this is a priori a complicated problem because kakutani s fixed - point theorem does not apply here because of the tie - breaking rule which induces discontinuities .",
    "of course , one can extend the framework to more than two - players , introduce mixed - strategies ... the analysis of spatial competition is an important issue in economics since hotelling s celebrated model @xcite and one may relate the equilibrium problem described above to this line of research .",
    "the study of the general nash problem is left for future research , but we give an elementary example where the solution is very simple and intuitive .",

    "second ) one optimally choses a pricing function of the form @xmath350 ( resp .",
    "@xmath351 ) for @xmath352 ( resp . for @xmath353 ) . at a nash equilibrium",
    "one must have @xmath354 ( if @xmath355 then @xmath329 makes zero profit as well as @xmath330 makes zero profit if @xmath356 ) .",
    "finally , the common value @xmath354 has to be @xmath357 , since if for instance @xmath358 then @xmath330 can charge a slightly lower price @xmath359 at the border point @xmath360 then getting the whole demand and increasing his profit for @xmath361 small enough . in this simple case",
