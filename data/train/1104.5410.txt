    "transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution functions , or alternatively named as three dimensional parton distribution functions ( 3dpdfs ) in momentum space , as an extension of the usual feynman distribution functions , enter the description of various semi - inclusive reactions  @xcite .",
    "the 3dpdfs , as well as the three - dimensional fragmentation functions in momentum space , encode a wealth of new information on the nucleon structures  @xcite that can not be described merely by the leading - twist collinear picture . at leading twist , there are eight 3dpdfs appearing in the decomposition of the quark - quark correlation matrix of the nucleon  @xcite @xmath3 & \\quad \\qquad + h_{1t}\\,\\frac{\\bigl[{\\kern 0.2 em s\\kern -0.50em /}_t , { \\kern 0.2 em n\\kern -0.50em /}_+ \\bigr]\\gamma_5}{2 } + \\left(s_l\\,h_{1l}^\\perp - \\frac{p_t \\cdot s_t}{m}\\,h_{1t}^\\perp\\right ) \\,\\frac{\\bigl[{\\kern 0.2 em p\\kern -0.50em /}_t , { \\kern 0.2 em n\\kern -0.50em",

    "each of these eight 3dpdfs represents a special parton structure of the nucleon .",
    "five of them , the sivers function @xmath11 , the boer - mulders function @xmath12 , the pretzelosity @xmath13 , the distributions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , vanish upon integration in @xmath16 . the essential tools to explore 3dpdfs are the azimuthal asymmetries in various polarized or unpolarized processes involving at least two hadrons , such as semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite and drell - yan  @xcite processes .",
    "the experimental data have been applied to extract some of the 3dpdfs , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sivers function  @xcite and the boer - mulders function  @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the distribution @xmath17 .",
    "it describes the probability of finding a transversely polarized quark inside a longitudinally polarized nucleon .",
    "so we could call it longitudinal transversity ( or shortly , longi - transversity or heli - transversity ) . therefore",
    ", this distribution manifests the chiral - odd parton structure of a longitudinally polarized nucleon .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that nonzero @xmath17 can yield a @xmath18 azimuthal asymmetry in the sidis process when the target nucleon is longitudinally polarized .",
    "the model calculations of @xmath19 have been given in refs .",
    "the phenomenological studies of the @xmath20 asymmetry in the longitudinally polarized sidis process  @xcite have been performed in @xcite and recently in  @xcite , showing that the asymmetry is around several per cent .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the effect of @xmath17 in the drell - yan process . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the combination of @xmath19 and the boer - mulders function may lead to a @xmath21 azimuthal asymmetry in the longitudinally polarized drell - yan process , where @xmath22 is the azimuthal angle of the dilepton with respect to the hadron plane .",
    "the phenomenological study of this kind of asymmetry in drell - yan has not been presented in literature yet .",
    "it is thus worth analyzing the @xmath21 asymmetry in the drell - yan process , which is the aim of this paper .",
    "the process we consider is the @xmath23 process , with the symbol  @xmath24 \" denoting the longitudinal polarization .",
    "the transversely polarized and unpolarized @xmath1 drell - yan processes have been studied in refs .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath1 drell - yan process is that the valence quarks participate the hard scattering , which might produce a larger asymmetry than that in the @xmath25 drell - yan process .",
    "we point out that , except the combination of @xmath17 and the boer - mulders function , there is no competing mechanism for the @xmath0 asymmetry in the single polarized drell - yan process , even by considering higher - twist effect .",
    "therefore the study of the @xmath0 asymmetry provides a rather clean probe for the distribution @xmath17 .",
    "for a general drell - yan process with one of the incident hadrons longitudinally polarized , i.e. , @xmath26 , the single longitudinal - spin asymmetry may be defined as @xmath27 this definition is similar to that of the single transverse - spin asymmetry .",
    "we treat the process in the parton model and only consider the leading - order approximation via a single photon transfer , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 .",
    "we denote the momenta of the hadrons , the annihilating partons , and the produced lepton pairs as @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "then the momentum transfer gives the invariant mass of the lepton pair @xmath32 now we work in the center of mass frame of two hadrons and parameterize the four - momentum of the photon as @xmath33 . at extremely high energies ,",
    "if we assume that the longitudinal component is dominant and neglect all the mass effects and the transverse momenta , we can define the following variables , @xmath34 then we can build up the relation @xmath35    the direction of the detected lepton pair can be described by the solid angle ( @xmath36 ) , which is frame dependent . in the entire paper , we will select the collins - soper frame  @xcite . in the @xmath37 drell - yan process ,",
    "if the transverse momentum of the dilepton @xmath38 is measured , we can apply the tmd factorization  @xcite to write down the differential cross - section in the region @xmath39 as  @xcite @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.s_{2l}b(y)\\sin(2\\phi)\\times \\mathcal{f}\\left[\\frac{2(\\hat{\\bm{h}}\\cdot\\bm{p}_{1t})(\\hat{\\bm{h}}\\cdot\\bm{p}_{2 t } ) -\\bm{p}_{1t}\\cdot\\bm{p}_{2t}}{m_1m_2}\\bar{h}_1^\\perp h_{1l}^\\perp\\right]\\right\\}+\\cdots , \\label{eq : csul}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 stands for the higher - twist contributions which will not be considered in this paper . in the above expression",
    "we have used the notation @xmath42 defined as @xmath43&\\equiv&\\sum_{a,\\bar{a}}\\int d\\bm{p}_{1t}d\\bm{p}_{2 t } \\delta^2(\\bm{p}_{1t}+\\bm{p}_{2t}-\\bm{q}_{t})\\omega(\\bm{p}_{1t},\\bm{p}_{2t})\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\bar{f}^{\\bar{a}}(x_1,\\bm{p}_{1t})g^{a}(x_2,\\bm{p}_{2t}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the momentum of the lepton , and @xmath47 . at leading twist",
    "there are two structure functions in the single longitudinally polarized drell - yan process , as shown in ( [ eq : csul ] ) .",
    "the second structure function shows that the combination of the two 3dpdfs , the boer - mulders function and @xmath17 , can lead to a @xmath0 azimuthal angle dependence of the dilepton .",
    "the size of this azimuthal angle dependence can be obtained by defining the following weighted asymmetry @xmath48}{\\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\phi [ d\\sigma^\\rightarrow + d\\sigma^\\leftarrow ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { b(y ) \\mathcal{f}\\left[\\left((2(\\hat{\\bm{h}}\\cdot\\bm{p}_{1t})(\\hat{\\bm{h}}\\cdot\\bm{p}_{2 t } ) -\\bm{p}_{1t}\\cdot\\bm{p}_{2t})/m_1m_2\\right)\\bar{h}_1^\\perp h_{1l}^\\perp\\right]\\over a(y)\\mathcal{f}[\\bar{f}_1f_1 ] } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper , we will investigate the @xmath49 and @xmath50 dependences of this asymmetry , thus we need to change the variables from @xmath51 and @xmath52 to @xmath53 and @xmath54 by using the relation ( [ x ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath0 asymmetry can be measured by experiment , it will provide a clear test on the chiral - odd structure of the longitudinally polarized nucleon and will bring valuable information of @xmath17 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this new 3dpdf , as well as another 3dpdf @xmath14 , was studied in the sidis process .",
    "however , @xmath14 can only be probed through double spin asymmetry , thus it can not be studied in the @xmath1 drell - yan process .",
    "in order to see the prospect of experimental measurements on the single longitudinal - polarized drell - yan process , we calculate the @xmath0 asymmetry of dilepton production by @xmath55 beams colliding on the longitudinally polarized nucleons .",
    "the experiment could be conducted at compass of cern in the near future  @xcite , since there are already longitudinally polarized proton and deuteron targets available ; besides , the utilization of the @xmath56 beam is quite promising at compass .",
    "we estimate the @xmath21 asymmetry of the @xmath57 and the @xmath58 drell - yan processes at compass .",
    "although the original proposal for the drell - yan process at compass is to use the @xmath56 beam , we consider the drell - yan process with @xmath59 beam as a supplement . also we provide the calculations for both the proton target and the deuteron target for comparison .    for the proton 3dpdfs",
    ", we will use the results obtained in a light - cone quark spectator diquark model  @xcite with the relativistic melosh - wigner effect  @xcite of quark transversal motions taken into account .",
    "the 3dpdfs deduced from this model are applicable in the hadronic scale . to compare with experimental observables which are usually measured at rather high energies ,",
    "it is essential to evolve the parton distributions to the experimental scale from the model scale .",
    "however , here we calculate the azimuthal asymmetries which are the ratios of different parton distributions , so the effects of evolution are assumed to be small . in practice , this model has been applied to obtain the helicity and transversity distributions , which are reasonable to describe data related to helicity distributions in a number of processes  @xcite , as well as those related to the collins asymmetry at hermes  @xcite .",
    "this model is also successful in the prediction of the dihadron production asymmetry at compass  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worth trying to apply the same model to the drell - yan kinematics at compass .    for the deuteron 3dpdfs , we will adopt the simple assumption that a deuteron nucleus consists of a free proton and a free neutron with the same polarization .",
    "we have @xmath60 which holds not only for unpolarized distributions but also for polarized distributions .",
    "this may be different from the @xmath61he case which was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , for the polarized case , there should be effective polarization factors for different nucleons because inside @xmath61he the neutron and the two protons have different polarizations .",
    "however , inside deuteron , the proton and neutron have the same polarization , or , equivalently , we assume that the effective polarization factor for each nucleon is 1 . in practice",
    ", we will also apply the isospin symmetry , @xmath62    besides this , we need the boer - mulders function for pions  @xcite , and we will use the parametrization in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was obtained in a quark spectator antiquark model .",
    "the pion parton distributions we adopt were demonstrated  @xcite to give a good description on the @xmath63 asymmetries measured in the unpolarized @xmath1 drell - yan process  @xcite , where a large and increasing asymmetry was observed in the @xmath50 region below 3 gev ; thus our model has been checked to be reasonable in this region .",
    "but for the longitudinal - polarized deuteron target . ]",
    "but for the longitudinal - polarized deuteron target . ]",
    "the compass kinematics we adopt in the calculation are  @xcite @xmath64 we will give a detailed explanation for the integration ranges of the kinematical variables as follows .",
    "* for the @xmath53 dependence , we only give the prediction for forward region @xmath65 . given a fixed @xmath66 , the range for @xmath54 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) so that @xmath67 .",
    "* for the @xmath54 dependence , given a fixed @xmath68 , the range for @xmath53 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) so that @xmath69 .",
    "* for the @xmath50 dependence , the range for @xmath54 is @xmath70 and the range for @xmath53 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) so that @xmath71 .",
    "we plot the @xmath0 asymmetries in the @xmath72 and @xmath73 drell - yan processes at compass in figs .",
    "[ prot ] and fig .",
    "[ deut ] , respectively .",
    "as the compass experiments will mainly probe the forward @xmath53 region , that is , the acceptance of compass at negative @xmath53 is much lower than that at positive @xmath53 , we only plot the asymmetries at the forward @xmath53 region .",
    "it is interesting to see that the asymmetries are about several percent , especially for the @xmath56 beam .",
    "therefore , it is promising that the @xmath21 asymmetries can be measured by experiments with a rather good accuracy .",
    "this is similar to what obtained in the sidis process  @xcite , where sizable @xmath74 asymmetry was predicted .",
    "so we do not need to apply the transverse momenta cutoff method to enhance the asymmetry , as was applied in the calculation @xmath75 asymmetry in the transversely polarized sidis  @xcite and drell - yan processes  @xcite .",
    "for the deuteron target , because of the isospin symmetry , we obtain similar results for the @xmath59 and @xmath56 beams .",
    "the sign of the @xmath76 asymmetry is the same as that of the @xmath77 asymmetry .",
    "this can be accounted for by the @xmath78 quark dominance in the proton ( see eq .",
    "( [ isospin ] ) .",
    "the signs of the asymmetry in @xmath79 process and that in @xmath77 process are opposite , which is in contrast to the case in @xmath80 process .    as a comparison",
    ", we calculate the @xmath21 asymmetry for the @xmath81 drell - yan process at rhic  @xcite with @xmath82 . in this case",
    "the pion beam is replaced by the proton beam .",
    "the rhic kinematics covers negative @xmath53 region , where the production of lepton pair is dominated by the sea antiquarks of the beam and valence quarks of the polarized proton .",
    "the kinematical cuts adopted in the calculations are @xmath83 in the calculation we need the boer - mulders functions of sea quarks inside the proton . in order to make the calculation to be consistent with the previous calculations for @xmath1 drell - yan process , we apply the baryon - meson fluctuation model results  @xcite for @xmath84 . in this model @xmath84 of the proton",
    "is expressed as the convolution of the fluctuation probability of @xmath85 baryon+@xmath55 meson and the boer - mulders functions of the pion . in fig .",
    "[ rhiceps ] we plot the predicted asymmetries at rhic as functions of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the predicted asymmetries are of several percent and are negative , similar to the case of @xmath86 process",
    ". we also present the asymmetry at the negative @xmath53 region , which is sizable .",
    "the similarity of the asymmetries in @xmath72 and @xmath87 processes suggests that the measurements of @xmath0 asymmetry can also be performed at rhic .",
    "we have presented the @xmath0 single spin asymmetries for the @xmath88 processes at compass .",
    "the magnitude of the asymmetries is several percent , indicating that they can be measured by experiments with a rather good accuracy .",
    "we predict asymmetries for both proton and deuteron targets . because of the isospin symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath56 beams lead to the similar magnitude of the asymmetry for deuteron target .",
    "the @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath89 drell - yan processes can not only provide the information on the boer - mulders function for the pion but also shed light on the there - dimensional parton distribution function @xmath15 , which tells us the probability of finding a transversely polarized quark inside a longitudinally polarized nucleon .",
    "this is why it was named as longi - transversity or heli - transversity , as suggested in ref .",
    "our predictions have already demonstrated the feasibility to probe this distribution at compass ; therefore , we expect the experiment could perform corresponding measurement to enrich our knowledge on the spin structure of the nucleon .",
