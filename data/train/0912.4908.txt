    "we also omit moduli of the form @xmath125 , since the distribution of primes into residue classes modulo such @xmath9 is the same as their distribution into residue classes modulo @xmath126 . )",
    "the values shown in figure  [ alldeltas1000 ] organize themselves into several bands ; each band corresponds to a constant value of @xmath27 , the effect of which on the density @xmath6 can be clearly seen in the second term on the right - hand side of equation  .",

    "each band decays roughly at a rate of @xmath132 , as is also evident from the aforementioned term of equation",
    ".    to give one further example of these computations , which we describe in section  [ explicit computation of the delta ] , we are able to find the largest values of @xmath6 that ever occur .",
    "( all decimals listed in this paper are rounded off in the last decimal place . )",
    "finally , the upper bounds for @xmath6 in theorems  [ delta bound prime q theorem ] and  [ delta<0.75 theorem ] , together with the explicit calculation of the densities @xmath6 for @xmath133 , allow us to determine the most biased possible two - way races , that is , the largest values of @xmath6 among all possible choices of @xmath9 , @xmath0 , and  @xmath1 .",
