    "the simulation of strongly correlated quantum or statistical systems in two or higher dimensions remains a great challenge in physics .",
    "this has stimulated great interest on the investigation of so called tensor network states or models in recent years.@xcite a tensor network state is a high - dimensional generalization of the one - dimensional matrix - product state@xcite studied by the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg).@xcite it captures accurately the key feature of entanglement in interacting quantum systems and is believed to be a good starting point for studying correlated systems . on the other hand , in a classical statistical system with local interactions , the boltzmann weight can be expressed as a tensor product and all thermodynamic quantities can be determined by studying this equivalent tensor network model .",
    "strongly correlated quantum spin or fermions systems pose some of the most intriguing problems in condensed matter theory",
    ". theoretical investigation on these problems generally starts from some simplified quantum lattice models , such as the heisenberg model , which describes the interactions among local spins , or the hubbard model , which describes the dynamics of band electrons subject to local coulomb interactions .",
    "it is difficult to solve these models because the dimension of hilbert space grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "furthermore , as quantum fluctuations are strong in these systems , there are no obvious small parameters that can be used in perturbative expansions .",
    "this is the main obstacle to the resolution of many fundamental problems , such as high - t@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "the quantum monte carlo and the dmrg are the two most commonly used numerical methods in the study of interacting quantum lattice models .",
    "the quantum monte carlo provides an accurate numerical tool for studying quantum spin models without frustrations , interacting boson models , or some special interacting fermion models .",
    "however , in most of fermion systems , such as the hubbard model away from half - filling , or quantum spin models with frustrations , such as the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , the quantum monte - carlo methods are hampered by the `` minus - sign '' problem .",
    "the dmrg was proposed by s. white to study ground states properties in 1992.@xcite it has been then extended to study thermodynamic@xcite as well as dynamic@xcite properties of quantum lattice models .",
    "it can be also used to study a system with nonlocal interactions , either in the momentum space@xcite or other basis space@xcite .",
    "an extensive review of dmrg is provided in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the dmrg minimizes the error in the truncation of basis states .",
    "it yields extraordinary precise results in one dimension . in two dimensions ,",
    "the dmrg gives reasonably good results for small quantum systems.@xcite however , its truncation error increases dramatically and the result becomes less reliable as the lattice size gets larger .",
    "the dmrg is an iteration method .",
    "it starts by dividing a system , called a superblock , into two blocks . like an experimental measurement , it uses one of the blocks as a needle to probe the states in the other block",
    "the response function measured by the dmrg is the reduced density matrix .",
    "the dmrg works well in one dimension because it captures the main feature of the entanglement between the two blocks .",
    "the entanglement spectra is determined by the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding entanglement entropy is defined by @xmath2 as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dmrg is to maximize the entanglement entropy during the basis truncation and can be regarded as a maximal entropy method .    for a gapped quantum system ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is believed to satisfy an area law , namely the entanglement entropy scales with the cross section between the system and environment blocks@xcite . for a matrix product state ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is bounded by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the matrix dimension .",
    "thus to accurately represent a quantum state by a matrix product , the minimal dimension of the matrix , above which the wavefunction converges exponentially , must grow exponentially with the surface cross section . in one dimension , the surface contains just two points , a small number of states @xmath4 is sufficient to make dmrg extremely accurate .    in two or higher dimensions ,",
    "the bond dimension that is needed for describing accurately a ground state grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "it is difficult to use a matrix product wavefunction to represent faithfully a quantum state in two or higher dimensions .",
    "that is why the dmrg can yield reliable results only in small lattice systems in two dimensions .",
    "it is an intrinsic barrier in the application of the dmrg in two or higher dimensions .    at a critical point",
    ", there is a logarithmic correction to the area law.@xcite this logarithmic correction does not affect much on the calculation of short range correlation functions .",
    "however , as it diverges with the system size , it can affect strongly on the calculation of long range correlation functions .",
    "the minimal matrix dimension will grow exponentially with the system size .",
    "this is why the dmrg works better in a gapped system , for example the spin-1 heisenberg model , than in a critical system , for example the spin-1/2 heisenberg model .    in 1995 ,",
    "ostlund and rommer pointed out that the wavefunction generated by the dmrg iteration is a matrix - product state.@xcite a matrix product state can be also taken as a variational wavefunction .",
    "it can be accurately determined by the dmrg in one dimension .",
    "the dmrg is a one - dimensional algorithm . to apply the dmrg in more than one dimension",
    ", one needs to map a two- or higher - dimensional lattice into a one - dimensional one by introducing nonlocal coupling.@xcite however , locality is the key of the great performance of the dmrg in one dimension . to capture the entanglement between any two neighboring sites , one needs to keep the locality of interactions .",
    "a tensor - network state is a high - dimensional extension of the one - dimensional matrix - product state .",
    "it keeps the locality of interactions and captures the main feature of the area law@xcite , since the number of entangled bonds between the systems and environment blocks is proportional to the interface area .",
    "a tensor product representation reflects accurately the short - range entanglement of a quantum state . like in a matrix product state in one dimension ,",
    "the minimal bond dimension that is needed for accurately describing a quantum state does not depend on the system size in a gapped system .",
    "this is an advantage of using the tensor representation .",
    "the tensor - network representation of quantum states is in fact not new .",
    "a typical example of tensor - network state is the valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) state that was proposed by afflect et .",
    "al more than two decades ago@xcite .",
    "it is the exact ground state of a class of two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "a tensor product wavefunction was also constructed by niggemann et al . to study the ground state properties of the heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice@xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the calculation of expectation values of tensor product states is equivalent to evaluating a classical partition function .",
    "a more general ansatz of tensor network states was suggested by sierra and martin - delgado@xcite .",
    "the use of the tensor network state as a variational wavefunction for the three - dimensional classical lattice model was suggested by nishino.@xcite in 2004 , the idea of tensor network state was discussed by cirac and coworkers under the name of projected entangled - pair states ( peps)@xcite . their work has attracted great attention because it reveals more clearly the physical picture embedded in the tensor - network representation of quantum states .    even before the tensor - network wavefunction was introduced in quantum systems ,",
    "a tensor - network representation of the partition function for classical lattice models has been widely used in statistical physics .",
    "a vertex model@xcite is such an example .",
    "furthermore , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tps ] , all classical lattice models with local interactions can be written as tensor - network models . unlike in a quantum system ,",
    "the local tensor can be readily determined from its hamiltonian .    in the past decade , a number of variational approaches have been suggested to determine the tensor - product wavefunction in quantum systems.@xcite however , the number of free tensor elements that can be handled by a variational approach is too small to resolve any physical problems that are difficult to be resolved by other methods .",
    "this is because in a variational approach , the maximal number of free variables can be accurately and efficiently determined from the minimization of the expectation value of hamiltonian is generally less than @xmath5 .",
    "this has limited the bond dimension to be generally less than 5 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a projection method ( or power method ) to evaluate the tensor - network wavefunction of the ground state . in this method ,",
    "the projection operator is applied iteratively to a random initial wavefunction by utilizing the trotter - suzuki decomposition .",
    "the contribution of the environment is approximately taken into account by the diagonal bond matrix .",
    "this method is quite efficient and accurate , since in the evaluation of the wavefunction by the imaginary time evolution , the trotter and truncation errors do not accumulate in the iteration . at each step of iteration , a singular value decomposition for a matrix of dimension @xmath6 on a honeycomb lattice , or",
    "@xmath7 on a square or kogome lattice , needs to be done . here",
    "@xmath8 is the dimension of the local basis set and @xmath4 is the bond dimension of the local tensor . for the spin-1/2 heisenberg model @xmath9 . nowadays",
    "a matrix of dimension @xmath10 can be efficiently diagonalized by a desktop computer .",
    "therefore , a tensor - network state with the bond dimension up to @xmath11 on a honeycomb lattice , or @xmath12 on a square or kagome lattice , can be calculated for the s=1/2 heisenberg model .",
    "the above projection method is similar that used by vidal in one dimension@xcite .",
    "but there is a significant difference between one and two dimensions . in one dimension ,",
    "there is a canonical representation of the matrix product state in which the bond vector is preciously the singular spectrum of schmidt decomposition",
    ". if the matrix product state is canonical , then by cutting a bond , the left and right matrix product states are strictly orthogonal .",
    "the projection method introduced in ref .   can be naturally imposed by applying the orthogonality condition . however , in two dimensions , this kind of orthogonality condition does not exist and the bond vector is no longer the singular spectrum of any kind of schmidt decompostion since to separate a point one needs to cut at least four bonds on a square lattice . our approach is to take the bond vector as an effective entanglement measure of environment .",
    "it goes beyond the canonical representation of tensor - network wavefunctions .    to evaluate the expectation values of physical observables from a given tensor - network wavefunction , a number of approaches , including the transfer matrix renormalization group introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite or the variational monte carlo mehtods@xcite , can be used . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopted the coarse graining tensor renormalization group ( trg ) method proposed by levin and nave @xcite . from the calculation",
    ", we find that the trg can indeed produce qualitatively correct results when the bond dimension of tensors is small .",
    "however , the truncation error in the trg iteration grows rapidly with the bond dimension of local tensors .",
    "this leads to a big error in the calculation of expectation values .",
    "in particular , the ground state energy and other physical quantities do not converge in the large bond dimension limit .    in the trg method of levin and nave ,",
    "the singular - value spectra of a local matrix @xmath13 defined by a product of two neighboring local tensors is renormalized in the truncation of basis space .",
    "this provides a local optimization of the truncation space since it does not consider the influence of the environment tensors which are defined from the whole lattice by excluding the two tensors on which @xmath13 is defined .",
    "similar as in the dmrg , the interplay between the system ( @xmath13 here ) and environment tensors can modify dramatically the singular - value spectra of @xmath13 .",
    "thus the renormalization effect of the environment to @xmath13 should be considered to globally optimize the accuracy of physical observable .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduced a second renormalization method of tensor network model ( abbreviated as srg ) to study this renormalization effect of environment .",
    "this method can be used to evaluate the partition functions of classical statistical models and the expectation values of quantum tensor - network wavefunctions .",
    "it improves significantly the accuracy of trg .",
    "for example , for the two - dimensional ising model , we found that this method can improve the accuracy of the trg by more than two orders of magnitude in the vicinity of the critical point and more than five orders of magnitude away from the critical point by keeping @xmath14 states .",
    "this method also provides a powerful numerical tool for accurately evaluating the expectation values of tensor - network states in a quantum lattice model .",
    "in contrast to the trg , we find that the srg results for the ground state energy of the heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice converge quickly with increasing bond dimension @xmath4 .    the srg together with the projection method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite establishes an efficient numerical technique for studying the tensor network states of quantum lattice models in two dimensions .",
    "the srg alone also provides an accurate numerical tool for studying thermodynamics of classical lattice models . in this paper",
    ", we will give a comprehensive introduction to these methods .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "[ sec : tps ] is devoted to a discussion on the tensor - network representation of classical lattice models .",
    "two methods are introduced to convert a classical lattice model into a tensor - network model .",
    "one is to define the local tensor in the dual lattice by performing a duality transformation , and the other is to define the local tensor by singular value decomposition in the original lattice .",
    "[ sec : srg ] starts by a brief review of the trg method . a detailed introduction to the srg",
    "is then given .",
    "[ sec : quantum ] describes the iterative projection method for determining the tensor - network wavefunction of ground state in a quantum system .",
    "the calculation of the expectation values of tensor - network states is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : expect ] .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is a summary .    for reference",
    ", we summarize a few notations used in this work : @xmath8 is the dimension of local physical basis set .",
    "@xmath4 is the bond dimension of a matrix or tensor product state in a quantum system .",
    "@xmath15 is the bond dimension of a classical tensor network model . in a quantum system",
    ", @xmath16 is the bond dimension of the tensor used in the evaluation of physical expectation values .",
    "@xmath17 is the bond dimension of the tensor retained in the trg or srg calculations .",
    "in this section , we discuss about the tensor - network representation of classical statistical models with local interactions .",
    "it is well known that the one - dimensional spin-1/2 ising model can be rigorously solved by expressing its partition function as a product of transfer matrix .",
    "this is the simplest example of tensor network representation of classical statistical model .",
    "a matrix is a order two tensor .",
    "a tensor network representation of classical statistic model is a higher dimensional extension of the one - dimensional matrix product .",
    "all statistical models with short - range interactions , such as the ising model and the pott s model , can be expressed as tensor network models .",
    "there are two approaches to represent the partition function of a classical statistical model in a tensor - network form .",
    "one is to take a duality transformation of the model and define the tensor in the dual space.@xcite this can transform a classical statistical model to a tensor - network model in its corresponding dual lattice .",
    "the order of the local tensor is the coordinate number of the dual lattice .",
    "this kind of transformation is particularly useful if the coordinate number of the dual lattice is smaller than the coordinate number of the original lattice .",
    "for example , a classical model defined on a triangular lattice whose coordinate number is 6 can be represented as a tensor - network model on a honeycomb lattice whose coordinate number is 3 .",
    "the dual lattice of a dice lattice is a kagome lattice .",
    "the square lattice is self - dual .",
    "if the original statistical model includes not only the nearest neighboring two - site interactions , but also many - site interactions within each constitutional unit cell , for example three- or four - site interaction within each plaquette in a square lattice , a tensor - network model can still be defined in the dual lattice without enlarging the bond dimension of tensor .",
    "this is another advantage for representing the partition function in the dual space .",
    "the second approach is to define the tensor in the original lattice by taking singular value decompositions for the local bond partitions .",
    "this approach can be also implemented in all kinds of lattices .",
    "the order of the tensor is equal to the coordinate number of the lattice if there are only interactions between neighboring sites .",
    "this kind of representation is more appropriate for a lattice , such as a honeycomb lattice , whose coordinate number is small .",
    "let us take the @xmath18 ising model defined on a triangular lattice as an example to illustrate how to express its partition function as a tensor product in its dual lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising model is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 takes two values @xmath21 .",
    "this model is rigorously soluble@xcite .",
    "the partition function of the ising model is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is to sum over all spin configurations and the product is taken over all small triangles .",
    "the factor @xmath24 is introduced in the above exponent because each bond is shared by two triangles .",
    "this partition function can be expressed as a tensor network in terms of bond variables through a duality transformation .",
    "the dual lattice of a triangular lattice is a honeycomb lattice .    given a bond on the triangular lattice ,",
    "let us define the bond spin by the the product of two end spins as @xmath25 this bond spin takes two values @xmath26 or @xmath27 , corresponding to a state of parallel or antiparallel ising spins .",
    "the partition function can then be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath23 is to sum over all @xmath29 and @xmath30 spins .    since the number of the bonds ( @xmath31 ) is equal to the sum of the number of sites ( @xmath32 ) and the number of triangles ( @xmath33 ) , the @xmath34 delta functions in the above equation",
    "can then be equivalently written as a product of @xmath32 delta functions defined on all lattice sites and @xmath33 delta functions defined on all triangles . on each triangle",
    ", it is simple to show that the product of the three bonds spins is equal to one @xmath35 this is the constraint defined on each triangle , independent on the original spin variables .",
    "thus the @xmath32-site delta functions can be integrated out .",
    "the partition function then becomes @xmath36    now",
    "if use @xmath37 to denote the site position of the dual lattice , then the above partition function can be expressed as a standard tensor - network model @xmath38 where the trace is to sum over all indices and @xmath39 is a third - order tensor defined on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the three integer bond indices of dimension @xmath43 defined on the three bonds emitted from site @xmath37 along the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 directions , respectively .",
