    "we will see however in the next section that some additional requirements coming from the reductions of the zms model impose a periodicity condition in @xmath20 for the function @xmath129 [ periodic ] t(k , b)= t(k+6/b , b ) , which suggests the following conjecture : [ ansatz ] t(k , b ) = .",
    "this function satisfy all the aforementioned requirements .",
    "a decisive check of the validity of this expression will be obtained in the following chapter by the comparison with explicit computations of form factors of primary operators in specific reductions of the zms model .",
    "this formula may be regarded as one of the main results of the paper .",
    "in fact it allows us to explicitly assign to every vertex operator @xmath147 in the bd model its form factors @xmath148 which are obtained from the cluster solutions @xmath125 of appendix a through the parameterization ( [ fn ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) by replacing @xmath149 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the analitical continuation of the model to imaginary values of the coupling constant @xmath21 , namely to possible reductions of the zms model . in these models",
    "the spectrum is no more a single  particle one as in the real coupling bd model , but it has a richer structure that depends on the model analyzed .",
    "we consider here only those restrictions whose spectrum still contains the elementary boson excitation of the bd model , namely @xmath2 and some cases of @xmath3 deformations , is not the fundamental particle in the bootstrap of the reductions of the zms model which is instead a three  component kink . ] .",
    "if we assume that the identification obtained between cluster solutions and vertex operators of the model is exact , we are then led to establish a correspondence between the form factors of exponential operators @xmath0 in the bd model and the form factors of scaling primary operators in the deformations according to the correspondence given by eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) and table 1 .",
    "an immediate consistency requirement for this procedure is obtained by imposing that the form factors respect the symmetry ( [ symkac ] ) of the kac table of minimal models .",
    "for example , the quantity @xmath150 of eq .",
    "( [ norminv ] ) should have the same value if evaluated at @xmath151 and @xmath152 . imposing this condition both in the @xmath2 deformations and in the @xmath3 relevant ones we obtain respectively that the following two symmetries of the function @xmath129 must hold t(k , b ) & = & t(-k-1 - 2/b , b ) , + t(k , b ) & = & t(-k-1 + 4/b , b ) , which in particular entail the above mentioned periodicity in @xmath20 , equation ( [ periodic ] ) .",
    "both these symmetries are indeed separately satisfied by the function ( [ ansatz ] ) .    a precise check on the validity of equation ( [ ansatz ] )",
    "is provided by comparing its predictions with the form factors of scaling primary operators in @xmath2 and @xmath3 deformations which can be found in literature .",
    "we have indeed computed the normalization invariant ratio @xmath153 using eq .",
    "( [ norminv ] ) and the assignments of table 1 , for all the known cases of primary form factors which have been analyzed in literature @xcite ( see table 2 ) and a perfect agreement has been found with all the values reported in the references .",
    "we stress here the fact that in the references considered , the form factors of primary operators have been identified by different techniques : in ref.s @xcite the identification has been obtained by using the correspondence between the deforming field and the trace of the stress",
    " energy tensor whereas in ref.s @xcite the form factors of the primary fields have been identified with the finite number of solutions of a non  linear system of cluster equations involving the form factors relative to the whole particle spectrum of the reduced models .",
    "the form factors @xmath154 that we have computed have been so far conveniently normalized putting @xmath124 . from equation ( [ norminvn ] )",
    "one immediately observes that these form factors are invariant under an additive redefinition of the field @xmath155 .",
    "we remove this ambiguity on the definition of the field @xmath5 by imposing that its vacuum expectation value @xmath156 be zero , namely subtracting from the original lagrangian field the value of the one point tadpole function .",
    "consider now the following expansion of the form factors of exponential operators : @xmath157 and of the vacuum expectation value @xmath158 if we now expand the form factors @xmath148 that we have obtained instead of @xmath127 to stress the dependence on @xmath20 .",
    "the relation between the two expressions is obviously given by @xmath149 eq .",

    "this observation in particular allows the exact determination of the wave function renormalization constant @xmath160 of the bd model .",

    "in this paper we have computed , in the framework of the bootstrap approach to integrable models , the first multiparticle solutions of form factor equations for general non  derivative scalar operators in the bd model . among these solutions",
    "we have selected a one  parameter family of cluster solutions which have been identified by means of the central result eq .",

    "the form factors of exponential operators allow to identify the form factors of relevant primary operators in the sector of the lightest breather of @xmath2 and @xmath3 deformations of minimal models and perfect agreement has been found with all the examples that we have found in literature . finally , by using the cluster solutions , we have computed the form factors of the fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 with the correct overall normalization and determined in this way the non  perturbative exact wave function renormalization constant of the model .",
    "we have therefore obtained the characterization of form factors for a whole basis in the space of scalar non  derivative operators and we have found complete consistency , in a non  perturbative setting , between the axiomatic @xmath9matrix approach to bootstrap systems and the lagrangian approach to quantum field theories .",
