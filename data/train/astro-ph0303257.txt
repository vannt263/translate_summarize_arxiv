    "it is now well established that substantial amounts of dark matter are needed to explain flat rotation curves in the outer regions of spiral galaxies . however , the amount of dark matter present in the inner , luminous region of a galaxy is not well determined .",
    "does a spiral galaxy conform to the maximum disc hypothesis ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ; salucci et al .",
    "1991 ; sellwood & moore 1999 ) which states that the luminous part should be scaled up as much as possible ? or is the maximum rotational contribution of the disc to the total rotation around 63% ? the latter being derived from observations of disc stellar velocity dispersions ( bottema 1993 , 1997 ) or suggested by a statistical analysis of rotation curve shapes in relation to the compactness of discs ( courteau & rix 1999 ) . when discs obey the 63% criterion , their mass - to - light ratio is half that of the maximum disc case , but the disc still dominates in the inner two to three scalelengths .",
    "a rotation curve analysis generally allows a maximum disc rotational contribution anywhere between 50 to 90% ( van der kruit 1995 ) .",
    "the above mentioned velocity dispersion measurements have only been done for a dozen galaxies and the analysis depends on the not well determined ratio of disc scalelength to scaleheight . as observations are not yet conclusive , numerical simulations of spiral galaxies may give clues regarding the disc to halo mass ratio .",
    "spiral structure of galaxies has eluded astronomers already for a long time .",
    "is it a quasi stationary density wave ( lin & shu 1964 , 1966 ) ? or is it a temporal phenomenon excited by internal or external disturbances and then swing amplified ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; toomre 1981 ) ? or is it some kind of combination , like swing amplified density waves ? until now theory and observations are inconclusive . to compound matters",
    ", there is the `` anti spiral theorem '' ( lynden - bell & ostriker 1967 ) , which states that spiral structure can not develop in a system governed by a time reversible description .",
    "consequently spiral arms can not exist in an isolated pure stellar galaxy .",
    "some kind of non time reversible action is needed , like external forcing or gas dissipation .",
    "the need for the latter mechanism is confirmed observationally ; in general when there is no gas there are no spiral arms . when studying spiral structure one thus has to include a gaseous component in the calculations . doing that , calculations in three dimensions are required because for a typical disc the scaleheight of the stellar component is five times as large as the scaleheight of the gas layer .",
    "some galaxies have bars , others do nt .",
    "ostriker & peebles ( 1973 ) showed that a stellar disc can be stabilized against bar formation by adding a spherical ( dark halo ) potential .",
    "this has lead to the common believe that barred galaxies have a larger disc to halo mass ratio compared to non - barred galaxies , although there is no observational evidence to support this believe .",
    "other theoretical and numerical calculations ( efstathiou et al . 1982 ; bottema & gerritsen 1997 ) investigating this matter reconfirm that a relatively larger disc mass results in a galaxy which is more unstable to bars .",
    "therefore this ratio is inevitably an important parameter in determining the appearance of a galaxy .",
    "another effective parameter has to be the stellar velocity dispersion of a disc .",
    "larger dispersions , expressed in a larger toomre s ( 1964 ) @xmath1 value , lead to a more stable disc ( sellwood & carlberg 1984 ) .",
    "in addition a substantial bulge makes a disc more stable against bars ( sellwood & evans 2001 ) .",
    "a proper investigation of disc galaxies involves a.o .",
    "dissipational and non linear processes .",
    "therefore this subject is not easily handled by analytical calculations and one has to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "results of such simulations can then guide the way to more detailed analyses of some specific aspects .",
    "concerning numerical simulations , the combination of the tree code ( barnes & hut 1986 ) for the collisionless part of a galaxy with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm ( lucy 1977 ) for the collisional part allows the study of a galaxy containing gas .",
    "however , this combined treesph code ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) has rarely been used to study the detailed evolution and stability of isolated galaxies .",
    "it has mainly been applied to investigate interacting galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1991 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; springel 2000 ) , galaxy formation ( katz & gunn 1991 ; katz 1992 ) or barred galaxies specifically ( friedli & benz 1993 , 1995 ) . a preliminary numerical study of spiral structure has been performed by elmegreen & thomasson ( 1993 ) while gerritsen ( 1997 ) and gerritsen & icke ( 1997 , hereafter : gi97 ) made a detailed numerical analysis of the distribution and interaction of the stellar and gaseous components in an isolated galaxy .    for a galaxy simulation",
    "one needs at least stars and gas .",
    "an optional bulge can be added and in order to make the observed flat rotation curves , a dark halo should be included .",
    "when gas is present , that cools and dissipates so that a star formation ( sf ) prescription is needed .",
    "that leads to gas depletion and to the formation of young stars with low velocity dispersions . sf",
    "also generates heating and stirring of the gas , preventing it from further collapse and so establishing a feedback loop which creates some kind of interstellar gas medium in equilibrium .",
    "these processes are too complex to be simulated from basic principles so that one needs a global description for the entities and processes in galaxy simulations .",
    "concerning sf there is a clear observational result , namely the schmidt ( 1959 ) law which states that the sf rate ( sfr ) is proportional to the gas density to a power @xmath2 : sfr @xmath3 .",
    "detailed observations and analyses by kennicutt ( 1983 , 1989 , 1998 ) and by ryder & dopita ( 1994 ) show that this schmidt law holds with @xmath4 for a wide range of ( surface ) densities in galactic discs .",
    "consequently this observation and proper exponent has to be the outcome of any numerical sf prescription .",
    "the interesting result of gi97 is that they reproduce the right schmidt law by using a star formation law based on a jeans criterion .",
    "they do not impose the schmidt law a priori , but it is the result of a more fundamental process . their scheme is therefore expected to hold for a broad range of physical conditions .",
    "it is well known that in a real galaxy young stars and sf regions exert a definite action on the ambient ism .",
    "the fierce radiation heats the gas and supernova ( sn ) action stirs up the ensemble of gas clouds .",
    "this sf feedback maintains an equilibrium state of the ism .",
    "when simulations lack such a feedback a catastrophic gas cooling occurs , forming super giant cloud complexes ( shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) . therefore in the numerical calculations also a sf feedback prescription is needed .    as mentioned above , elmegreen & thomasson ( 1993 ) made a numerical study of isolated galaxies to specifically investigate spiral structure , more or less as a function of disc to halo mass ratio .",
    "they find for a `` rather massive '' disc a grand design @xmath0 structure which lasts for several rotation periods . for substantially less massive discs the spiral structure becomes flocculent .",
    "though their investigation is very interesting it contains several caveats .",
    "the main one is that the development of a bar is prevented in at least two ways .",
    "firstly by using an artificial @xmath1 barrier in the inner regions .",
    "secondly the disc is stabilized by a large softening length ( romeo 1994 ) which has to be used to perform the two dimensional simulations .",
    "therefore it is expected that the results of elmegreen & thomasson only partially apply to a real galaxy .",
    "results in the present paper differ from the study of elmegreen & thomasson mainly relating to the development of a bar in massive discs .",
    "my original intention was to investigate what happens to the morphology of a normal galaxy when the ratio of disc to dark matter changes . inevitably , during the research other and additional problems emerged which necessitated a somewhat broader scope .",
    "nevertheless this paper still focuses on the global properties and global morphology of a galaxy and does not aim to go into specific details . besides the abovementioned mass ratio another defining parameter for a galactic disc is the value of the stellar velocity dispersion , or more or less equivalently , the thickness of the disc .",
    "in addition effects of the amount of sn feedback and amount of available gas have been considered .",
    "the investigations are restricted to late type galaxies for which ngc 628 serves as template .",
    "that galaxy is nearly face - on , has only a minor bulge , and has a well defined , non barred spiral structure .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the code and all the relevant prescriptions .",
    "the employed numerical scheme is based on the works of gi97 , gerritsen ( 1997 ) , and hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) .",
    "besides the nice asset of reproducing the schmidt law , the scheme creates a multiple phase interstellar medium , equal to the situation in a real galaxy .",
    "gi97 performed their simulations for galaxies with low sf rates and then an equilibrium gas state can be achieved by uv heating only .",
    "when the sfr crosses a certain threshold it is necessary to include mechanical feedback in addition .",
    "this supernova feedback will be desribed in sufficient detail . in sect .",
    "3 the model galaxy is described and in sect .",
    "4 several properties and adaptations are discussed . to create a realistic disc in star formation equilibrium in sect .",
    "5 the necessary amount of sn feedback and external gas supply are determined .",
    "section 6 describes what happens when the main parameters ; disc to halo mass ratio and disc thickness are varied .",
    "when does a bar form and what is the global morphology ?",
    "in sect . 7",
    "an analysis and discussion is given of the gas properties , like temperature distribution and gas velocity dispersion .",
    "section 8 deals in some detail with the spiral structure and compares results from the simulations with observations . in sect .",
    "9 the theory of swing amplification is applied to the galaxies under investigation and finally in sect . 10 a general discussion",
    "is given and a point by point summary of the conclusions .",
    "the evolution of a galaxy is simulated using a hybrid n - body / hydrodynamics code ( treesph ; hernquist & katz 1989 ) . a tree algorithm ( barnes & hut 1986 ; hernquist 1987 ) determines the gravitational forces on both the stellar and gaseous components of the galaxy .",
    "the hydrodynamic properties of the gas are modelled using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( lucy 1977 ; gingold & monaghan 1977 ) .",
    "the gas evolves according to hydrodynamic conservation laws , including an artificial viscosity for the treatment of shocks .",
    "each gas particle is assigned an individual smoothing length , @xmath5 , which determines the local resolution .",
    "gas properties are found by smoothing over @xmath6 neighbours within @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is typically 64 for a number of gas particles larger than 12.000 .",
    "the acceleration @xmath8 of particle @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the pressure , @xmath12 the artificial viscosity term ( monaghan 1989 ) , and @xmath13 the gravitational potential . for the evolution of the specific thermal energy @xmath14",
    "an expression is chosen as @xmath15 where @xmath16 accounts for the non - adiabatic heating and cooling terms . to close the system of equations describing the evolution of the fluid an equation of state @xmath17 is adopted with @xmath18 for an ideal gas .",
    "time steps of the stellar particles were equal to 1.5  10@xmath19 years . for gas ( sph ) particles",
    "a variable time step was used determined by the courant - friedrichs - levy condition , with a maximum of 1.5  10@xmath19 years .",
    "the softening of stellar particles was not implemented by the usual softened force law : @xmath20 but by a smoothing kernel surrounding the stellar particle ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) . in that way a better approximation is achieved of the real force law .",
    "the cooling term @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) describes the radiative cooling of the gas . for the simulations a constant composition of plus helium gas",
    "is adopted .",
    "the `` standard '' cooling function of dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) was used for this gas , parameterized as @xmath22 } & = & 10^{-21 } n_h^2 { \\bigl [ } 10^{-0.1 - 1.88(5.23 - { \\rm log}t)^4 } + \\nonumber \\\\ & & 10^{-a - b(4 - { \\rm log}t)^c } { \\bigr ] } \\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm if}\\;\\ ; { \\rm log}t < 6.2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 } = 10^{-22.7 } n_h^2 \\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm if}\\;\\ ; { \\rm log}t > 6.2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the temperature and @xmath25 the hydrogen density in @xmath26 . the second term on the right hand side of eq . ( 4 ) determines the cooling below 10@xmath27  k , which is strongly dependent on the amount of ionization of the gas . for an ionization parameter @xmath28 of 0.1 (",
    "cox 1990 ) a good approximation of dalgarno & mccray s cooling function is found for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the star formation rate is dependent on the amount of cooling below 10@xmath27  k and the parameter @xmath31 mainly determines this amount . for a lower ionization or for lower abundances",
    "the cooling will be smaller and the sfr lower ( gerritsen & de blok 1999 ) . in the calculations the cooling rate for all gas",
    "is set a priori equal to approximately the solar neighbourhood value .",
    "the effects of metallicity changes in a galaxy have not been considered .",
    "the heating of the gas @xmath32 is described by two terms : @xmath33 } = 10^{-24 } \\epsilon g_0 n_h + c_{\\rm cr } n_h , \\ ] ] where the first term represents photoelectric heating of small grains and pahs ( de jong 1977 ; wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) and dominates in the stellar disc region . in eq .",
    "( 6 ) @xmath34 is the heating efficiency and @xmath35 is the incident far - ultraviolet field ( 912 to 2100  ) normalized to habing s ( 1968 ) estimate of the local interstellar value (= 1.6 10@xmath36 erg @xmath37 s@xmath38 ) .",
    "this heating efficiency @xmath39 for temperatures below 10.000  k. the second term in eq .",
    "( 6 ) represents the so called `` cosmic ray '' heating ( black 1987 ; spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "a value of 7.8  10@xmath40 erg  s@xmath38 has been used for the cosmic ray heating constant @xmath41 . in a normal stellar environment cosmic ray heating",
    "is negligible compared to the grain heating . yet in the outer regions of a galaxy , beyond the stellar edge , it is still small , but it is the only heating source .",
    "this term has been included after the work of gi97 to prevent too much cooling and star formation in those outer regions .",
    "since the gas is heated mainly by fuv photons , the stellar radiation field has to be calculated . in the simulations each stellar particle effectively represents a stellar association .",
    "such an association is formed instantaneously and consequently each stellar particle has an age and a belonging fuv flux according to that age .",
    "this flux has been calculated using the population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) for a certain specified imf .",
    "knowing the fuv flux for every stellar particle , the radiation field is calculated by summing the individual fluxes corrected for geometric dilution .",
    "no extinction corrections have been applied .",
    "the cooling of the gas increases by more than a factor 10@xmath42 for temperatures rising above 10@xmath27  k. that temperature is therefore effectively an upper limit , virtually independent of the heat input .",
    "star formation on scales @xmath43 giant molecular clouds is a very complicated process .",
    "it involves matters like heating / cooling balance , collapse , fractionization and sub fractionization , the transition of into h@xmath44 , magnetic fields , winds , sn explosions , shocks , ionization , desintegration , etc , etc .",
    "gmcs , where the star formation takes place , have typical masses of a few times 10@xmath45 to 10@xmath19 @xmath46 , densities @xmath47 10@xmath42 @xmath26 and lifetimes of 10@xmath48 to 10@xmath49 years ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ; bodenheimer 1992 ) .",
    "masses of gas particles in the simulation range typically from 5  10@xmath45 to 10@xmath19 solar masses , being comparable to gmcs . a star formation recipe is thus a prescription of converting gmcs into stellar associations and does not consider all the processes mentioned above .",
    "the formation of stellar associations ( @xmath50 stellar particles ) proceeds nearly equal as described by gi97 . for convenience a summary of this star formation process",
    "will be given .",
    "in sph simulations the gas particles sample properties such as density and temperature . for each particle",
    "one can therefore calculate the jeans mass @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the density , @xmath54 the sound speed and @xmath55 the gravitational constant . if this jeans mass is smaller than a prescribed critical mass @xmath56 , which is of the order of the mass of a gmc , then the gas particle is in a cold and dense environment and is considered unstable to star formation .",
    "so , the condition @xmath57 is a first criterion a gas particle has to obey to form a stellar particle .    once a region is unstable , it takes a collapse time to form a stellar cluster . as a second criterion",
    "it has been chosen that a gas particle has to remain unstable for a time span longer than a fraction @xmath58 of the free - fall time @xmath59 : @xmath60 as soon as an sph particle has fulfilled both conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) a part of its mass ( @xmath61 ) is converted into a stellar particle with mass @xmath62 @xmath63 this continues untill the mass of a gas particle would drop below 0.1 times its original mass , then the whole remaining gas particle is turned into a new star . the star particle is given the same imf as all other star particles , and age zero .",
    "new star particles are then included in the calculation of the radiation field and the ambient gas will be heated . in this way a self regulating star formation process is established .",
    "gi97 made a thorough investigation of the effects when a specified sf parameter is changed .",
    "in short , the cooling function essentially determines the sfr and a change of the collapse factor @xmath58 changes the ratio of warm to cold gas .",
    "changing other parameters has a negligible or only a small effect on observable structures and quantities . in the present study",
    "the star formation parameters are essentially fixed at a certain value .",
    "the critical mass @xmath56 is equal to the value of a gmc , the imf is salpeter ( 0.1 @xmath64 125 @xmath46 ) , the cooling function is solar neighbourhood and @xmath65 .",
    "the collapse factor was determined at 0.5 such that the gas is not too clumpy and the warm to cold gas ratio is reasonable ( see sect . 5.1 and 7.2 ) .",
    "besides the fuv feedback on the gaseous medium there is also the mechanical feedback by supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "a method to implement that feedback has been developed by gerritsen ( 1997 ) which i have largely taken over . since a description has not appeared in the refereed literature and because a number of changes have been made to the method , a detailed description now follows .",
    "winds and supernovae from ob associations are capable of blowing cavities in the surrounding ism . in the standard model for such a process",
    "the mechanical energy is injected into a hot bubble which sweeps up the external medium by a dense shell ( mccray & kafatos 1987 ) .",
    "not all the energy is converted into kinetic energy of the expanding shell .",
    "silich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) demonstrate that most of the energy is simply radiated away and only 5 to 10% ends up in the expanding shell .",
    "an amount of @xmath66 10@xmath67 ergs of energy is provided by each supernova so that every star more massive than 8  @xmath46 supplies that amount to the mechanical feedback process .",
    "additional energy is provided by winds from massive and medium size stars ( lamers & leitherer 1993 ) .",
    "the more classical implementation of mechanical feedback is by `` kicking '' the surrounding ism .",
    "the gas around a young star cluster is then given a velocity perturbation directed radially away from the cluster .",
    "a free parameter in this implementation is the fraction of the released energy @xmath68 that is put into the velocity perturbation .",
    "the feedback may have profound effects on the gas depending largely on the value of @xmath69 .",
    "for example , navarro & white ( 1993 ) favour values of @xmath70 in their cosmological simulations .",
    "but friedly & benz ( 1995 ) take of the order of 0.01 for barred galaxies and mihos & hernquist ( 1994 , 1996 ) use @xmath71 for simulations of interacting galaxies .",
    "clearly there is a lot of arbitraryness as to the choice of @xmath69 .    at present a different approach to implement",
    "mechanical feedback has been chosen .",
    "following an idea by heller & shlosman ( 1994 ) a fraction of the mechanical energy is given as thermal energy to one gas particle during a certain amount of time . in this way a hot bubble is simulated by making one sph particle hot ; from now on called sn particle .",
    "it is further left to the treesph program to distribute the energy to the surrounding gas particles like a pseudo - point explosion .    for the implementation in the code it has to be realized that one is dealing with particles representing gmcs and whole star forming regions .",
    "when a gas particle ( gmc ) is deemed to form a star particle ( sf region ) half of its mass is transformed into a star particle with zero age and belonging imf .",
    "the other half of the gas particle is designated as sn particle possessing the mechanical energy appropriate for the sf region . for a period of @xmath66 3  10@xmath48 years",
    "sn activity is present in the sf region and for such a time the sn particle is both , fixed to the parent star particle , and kept hot . to illustrate matters , in fig .",
    "1 the sn energy is given as a function of time according to the bruzual & charlot population synthesis code .",
    "on top of that figure the simplified sn particle energy is displayed .",
    "for a small time span after star formation sn activity is not yet switched on and the sn particle is kept at a temperature of 10@xmath27  k. after that a fraction @xmath72 of the total sn energy of the sf region is given as thermal energy to the sn particle . this total sn energy is calculated from the total mass of the new star cluster , the assumed imf , and the fact that all stars go sn for a mass @xmath47 8  @xmath46 . after a time",
    "@xmath73 no more energy is supplied to the sn particle and it is allowed to cool again which it will do quickly in practice .    in reality there is a time variability of the sn action ( fig . 1 ) and a poorly known energy contribution from winds .",
    "these details and uncertainties have been included in the free parameter @xmath72 .",
    "after the sn phase the gas particle returns to being a normal sph particle which may undergo a next event of star formation if the conditions are right .",
    "most simulations in this paper are performed for @xmath74 25% , and for a regular sf where half the gas mass is transformed into stars , the belonging temperature of the sn particle amounts to 1.25  10@xmath48  k. in this , albeit artificial , way a three phase ism is created containing cold , warm , and hot gas ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "gerritsen ( 1997 ) did some testing of this method on isolated galaxies .",
    "it appeared that realistic cavities are created in the ism , where the holes are smaller in the central denser regions and larger near the rim of the gas distribution .",
    "the size and the size distribution of the holes does not depend on the number of gas particles .",
    "this demonstrates the reliability of the method and shows it can be used for a large gas density range even at a limited resolution .",
    "compared to a situation with only fuv heating of the gas , adding the mechanical feedback changes the gas appearance to a different and larger design .",
    "all the calculations have been performed for one model galaxy with different internal compositions .",
    "this galaxy consists of four components : a stellar disc , a gas layer , a bulge , and a dark halo .",
    "this disc and gas layer are made up of stellar and gas particles while the bulge and halo are implemented as rigid , `` dead '' , potentials .",
    "an exponential stellar disc is assumed with a locally isothermal z - distribution ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the scalelength of the disc and @xmath77 the thickness parameter which was constant as a function of radius .",
    "if the disc were isolated the vertical stellar velocity dispersion @xmath78 depends on the stellar surface density @xmath79 as @xmath80 in reality adjustments are necessary to this relation because the other galactic components influence the stellar velocity dispersion . for the setup of the galaxy",
    "only the gas has been taken into account such that in eq . (",

    "( 1985 ) gives a maximum rotation of approximately 200 .",
    "this value has been adopted as the exact maximum rotation for the model galaxy together with the observational establishment that rotation curves are flat in the outer regions of a galaxy .",
    "for the exponential disc rotation curves have been calculated ( casertano 1983 ) scaled to four different maximum rotational values of 126 , 150 , 165 , and 180 .",
    "these four stellar discs all have a certain mass and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "combined with each disc is a bulge density distribution where equal m / l ratios of bulge and disc have been assumed . for the four cases",

    "the result of this fitting procedure is shown in fig .",
    "3 and numerical values are presented in table 1 .",
    "also given in fig .",
    "3 is the actual stellar rotation which results after the subtraction of the asymmetric drift , in this case for a @xmath77 value of 900 pc .",
    "to gain insight into the possible morphologies of a disc , the main structural parameter to be investigated is the ratio of maximum disc rotation to total rotation : @xmath113 .",
    "though it has already been known since the calculations by ostriker & peebles ( 1973 ) that a galaxy where the disc approaches its maximum disc limit is unstable to bar formation , ( see also bottema & gerritsen 1997 ) that notion should be confirmed for an actual 3d disc with gas and star formation .",
    "inevitably related to the matter of stability must be the thickness of the disc .",
    "a thicker disc has a larger vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "the dispersions in the three directions are related , which means that a thicker disc has a larger @xmath1 value and should at least be more stable to local distortions .",

    "the precise amount and the process by which mechanical sn energy is transferred to the gas is not known .",
    "consequently the influence of the parameter @xmath72 will be considered in some detail .",
    "a fourth parameter has been added during the course of the simulations . for a resulting sfr of 4 @xmath114 it appeared that the gas reservoir becomes depleted pretty fast . to create a constant situation over a reasonable time span",
    ", gas has been added at several rates .",
    "summarizing , the main parameters investigated in this paper are : @xmath113 , @xmath77 , @xmath72 , and gas supply .      for most simulations",
    "the number of stellar particles was 150.000 and the number of gas particles 16.000 , though some simulations are presented using 40.000 gas particles . in table 1",
    "the total stellar disc masses are given for the various maximum disc rotations . from @xmath115 = 126 to 180 the stellar particle masses then range from 0.3  10@xmath19 to 0.6  10@xmath19 @xmath46 .",
    "for a total gas mass of 18.8  10@xmath87 @xmath46 and 16.000 gas particles , the mass of one gas particle amounts to 1.18  10@xmath19 @xmath46 . during the star formation process",
    "new stellar particles are created with masses of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 of the mass of a gas particle , being comparable to the masses of the already existent stellar particles .",
    "the sfr as defined here is the total amount of gas mass which is transformed into stellar mass , per time unit . in the code",
    "no stellar mass is returned to the gas reservoir . for an actual galaxy with a standard imf , approximately 70% of the gas that has formed stars",
    "is eventually locked up in old stars and stellar remnants .",
    "the other 30% is returned , of which most in a short time scale after sf . because this time scale is so short",
    "the non returning of gas in the numerical simulations is a good approximation .",
    "however , the star formation rate that could be observed is then not equal to the sfr as defined above . for a lock up rate of 70%",
    "the `` observable sfr '' is defined as 1/0.7 times the sfr and can as such be compared with observations .",
    "kennicutt ( 1983 ) has determined an `` observable sfr '' of 3.8 @xmath119 for ngc 628 , when it is put at a distance of 11.5 mpc .",
    "there is a systematic error of approximately a factor of two associated with this value of 3.8 @xmath119 mainly caused by the uncertainty of the imf .",
    "an average galactic disc is essentially collisionless . in a simulation a disc",
    "is made up of far less particles than the number of stars in a real galaxy .",
    "as a result encounters between particles will occur in simulations and the particle ensemble will be heated up .",
    "this process of particle scattering is commonly referred to as stochastic heating . in practice",
    "this means that a model disc made up of a limited number of particles will heat up , get thicker , and become more stable during a simulation .    in a real galaxy which contains gas , stellar heating",
    "may be generated by two processes . at first heating by encounters of stars with molecular clouds ( spitzer & schwarzschild 1953 ; villumsen 1985 ) .",
    "secondly a more effective mechanism seems to be heating by transient spiral structures ( barbanis & woltjer 1967 ; carlberg & sellwood 1985 ) though in practice a combination of both mechanisms is likely taking place . in a simulation with a limited number of stars , and with spiral arms and cloud complexes both , stochastic",
    "heating and real heating will take place .",
    "the problem is to disentangle the two .",
    "this disentanglement can be done by considering the change of the stellar velocity dispersion . from basic principles",
    "one can derive for stochastic heating that @xmath120 such that the change of the square of the velocity dispersion is proportional to a function of the number of particles @xmath6 . during a simulation",
    "the square of the velocity dispersion will increase by stochastic heating and by heating of clouds and arms .",
    "if the same simulation is repeated for different numbers of stellar particles both heating processes can be disentangled .",
    "another way to study the matter is by comparing the same simulations with and without gas , as long as the gasless simulation produces a smooth featureless disc . using these methods ,",
    "a small investigation was done for a simulation using @xmath115 = 150 and @xmath77 = 675 pc .",
    "it appears that for a total of 180.000 stellar particles the disc does not show stochastic heating at a radius of one scalelength and shows it barely at two scalelengths . as a final compromise",
    "a number of 150.000 stellar particles has been used for all discs .",
    "this means that beyond a radius of approximately two scalelengths a small amount of heating will be present , not occurring in real galaxies .      when performing 2d simulations of discs , the thickness is generally artificially implemented by taking a stellar softening of size comparable to the scaleheight of the disc .",
    "the particles then do not meet in the plane but a disadvantage of this adaptation is a considerable additional stabilization compared to a 3d situation with the same dimension and kinematics ( romeo 1994 ) .    for 3d simulations considerations on the size of the softening length",
    "have been made by hernquist ( 1987 ) .",
    "it appears that in order to achieve a good approximation of the force computation the softening length should be smaller then @xmath121 , being the mean interparticle distance at the half mass radius . for an exponential disc hernquist",
    "gives an approximation of @xmath122 which for the present case of ngc 628 with @xmath123 gives @xmath124 120 pc .",
    "one may consider other evaluations of @xmath121 , for instance the mean interparticle distance at the half mass height above the plane . in that case @xmath121",
    "ranges from @xmath66 110 pc at the centre to @xmath66 230 pc at @xmath125 .",
    "when a bar develops , however , @xmath121 may become even smaller in the bar region .",
    "therefore , for the galaxy under investigation in this study the softening length should be smaller than approximately 100 pc .    to get a lower limit on the softening length is more problematic .",
    "if @xmath126 is too small , strong interactions between particles will occur .",
    "that is especially problematic when particles with different mass are present ; the lightest particle will then be ejected , carrying with it large amounts of energy and angular momentum . in addition , for close particle interactions the time step may be too small to achieve a correct orbit integration . to investigate matters ,",
    "pure stellar simulations have been performed for a case where a moderate bar develops ( fig .",
    "10 , bottom left ) with @xmath126 ranging from 2 to 200 pc . for @xmath126 between 10 and 200 pc the resulting structure and stellar kinematics is practically equal .",
    "for @xmath127 pc particles get ejected from the galaxy ( particles have masses differing @xmath66 a factor two ) which changes the eventual morphology . it is therefore concluded that for the present calculations there is a safe range between 10 to 100 pc for the stellar softening length .",
    "it has been fixed at 20 pc for all simulations . in no case there",
    "will then be artificial stabilization by a too large softening length .      in first instance",
    "this quotient was put at 0.6 for all radii as an extrapolation of the number for old disc stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "consequently the function @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) @xmath128 for all radii . during the initial stages of the simulation , for the more massive discs",
    ", there appeared to be some outflow of stars from the central regions . a solution to this problem",
    "was found after comparing the final quotient for some realistic simulations with the original input ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . at the end of the simulations",
    "the velocity dispersion ellipsoid is always more spherical in the inner regions , while it remains at @xmath129 near two scalelengths .",
    "the initial model galaxy has been adapted to have a function @xmath90 slightly variable as a function of radius . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the central quotient was put at 0.7 ( for @xmath130 ) , at 0.8 ( for @xmath131 and 165 ) or 0.9 ( for @xmath132 ) and decreased linearly to 0.6 at a radius of 10 kpc .",
    "for such a setup the initial central instability has completely disappeared . for a disc with maximum disc rotation of 126 or lower this adaptation was , in principle , not necessary ; the galaxy slowly changes to the final quotient without noticeable redistribution of matter .",
    "the first parameter of which the effect has been investigated is the sn efficiency . to that aim",
    "a realization of the model galaxy has been chosen which is close to what observations of galactic discs suggest .",
    "therefore a thickness @xmath77 of 675 pc is assumed ( van der kruit & searle 1982 ) and a disc maximum rotational contribution of 63% ( bottema 1993 ) . by no means",
    "the statement is given that this galactic constitution is the closest to reality ; only that it is a reasonable assumption and suitable to test the effect of the amount of sn feedback . during the simulations gas",
    "has been supplied at a rate of 4 @xmath114 being approximately equal to the amount of gas depletion by sf .",
    "results of @xmath72 = 0% , 5% , 25% , and 50% are given in fig .",
    "5 where for each case the simulated v - band image , stellar mass image , and gas mass image is presented .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "5 is pretty self explainable .",
    "if the sn feedback is absent or small , dense clumps of gas and young stars are created , which dominate the v - band and gas image . on these clumps cold gas continues to accumulate and because the density is so large , the cooling outruns the heating by the fuv field of young stars .",
    "it should be kept in mind that cooling proceeds proportional to the square of the gas density ( eq .",
    "4 ) and heating proportional to the first power of the density ( eq . 6 ) and a runaway process as observed might indeed be expected to occur . for an @xmath72 of 25%",
    "the clumping process has almost completely disappeared and a number of spiral arms appear in the stellar light , mass , and gas distribution . certainly in the gas structure",
    "these arms have a certain width contrary to the lower @xmath72 simulations where the gas arms are thin and have a threaded appearance . increasing the supernova feedback to the high value of 50% results in the creation of multiple holes in the gas structure .",
    "the feedback is now so violent that spiral arms in the gas image have all but disappeared . as a result also",
    "the strength of the spiral arms in the light and stellar mass images decreases .    for the different sn feedback situations the resulting sfr as a function of time",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "6 . in case of low @xmath72 and the generated severe",
    "clumping the sfr keeps on increasing , evidencing the runaway star formation process .",
    "if this would continue , the galaxy gets quickly depleted of its gas and the sf activity would subside again . a larger sn feedback results in a lower sfr , though above @xmath72 = 25% the sfr remains more or less constant at a level of 4.2 @xmath114 .",
    "corrected for stellar mass loss ( sect .",
    "4.3 ) this gives 6 @xmath114 which is in good agreement with the observed value for ngc 628 ( kennicutt 1983 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for the process of stochastic self propagating sf by supernovae explosions ( mueller & arnett 1976 ; elmegreen 1992 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "more sn action decreases the amount of sf when the sn action is low , while for higher regimes of sn action the sfr seems to be almost independent of the amount of sn feedback . during the simulations star formation",
    "occurs mainly by cooling and dissipation of the gas .",
    "sn action prevents a runaway sf process and influences the gas morphology .",
    "an investigation has been made of how the structures and relations of fig .",
    "5 depend on other parameters .",
    "it does not depend on the value of @xmath56 ( eq .  7 ) .",
    "there is a dependence , however , on the value of the collapse factor @xmath58 ( eq .",
    "if the time span before star formation is increased from the nominal value of @xmath133 the relative amount of cold ( @xmath134 500  k ) gas increases and the clumping process sets in at higher sn feedback values , and vice versa . since the ratio of cold to warm gas is as yet undetermined it is impossible to pinpoint down the exact value of @xmath72 ( see sect . 7 for an ample discussion ) .",
    "still , following indications of the observations leading to the adopted values for the parameters , the relation between the morphology in fig . 5 and the value of @xmath72 is likely accurate to within a factor of two .",
    "as noted before , it became evident during this investigation that when having a gas consumption rate of @xmath66 4 @xmath119 for a total gas amount of 18.8  10@xmath87 @xmath46 , the gas gets depleted pretty fast . in the mean time , it takes a while , lets say some 0.8  10@xmath87 yrs , before a stable galaxy emerges ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . to have a constant gas reservoir over at least this adjustment time",
    "it was decided to create the possibility to add gas at a certain rate . for a real galaxy",
    "it is also expected that gas gets accreted , although the way how is ( still ) unclear .",
    "therefore this gas suppletion is less artificial than it might seem .",
    "care has been taken that the addition of gas does not alter the available gas structure .",
    "for example , gas should not be supplied at those positions where it has just recently been removed by star formation .",
    "gas particles have been added randomly by selecting another gas particle and placing the new gas close to that selected particle . from this selection",
    "are excluded gas particles with temperatures above 20.000  k or below 5000  k. also excluded are , of course , sn particles or particles already jeans unstable .",
    "it became clear that when gas is added at places beyond the stellar disc , that only increases the amount of gas over there , taking more computing time , and not replenishing the gas where it is depleted .",
    "therefore no gas has been added at radii larger than 25 kpc .",
    "it was originally expected that extra gas at large radii would slowly migrate inwards by dissipation and viscous interaction .",
    "that process , however , did not take place .",
    "the morphology and sfr of a galactic disc has been investigated in cases of gas addition of 0 , 4 , and 8 @xmath119 during a period of 1.5 10@xmath87 years .",
    "a disc is chosen equal to the one where the amount of sn action was investigated , with a fixed @xmath72 of 25% .",
    "a sfr at a constant level is achieved when @xmath135 @xmath119 is added .",
    "when no gas is added the sfr approaches 4 @xmath119 after 3 to 4  10@xmath49 years from the start of the simulation , and declines gradually thereafter ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . at the end of the simulation",
    "the sfr has decreased to 2 @xmath119 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "7 , when gas is added at 8 @xmath119 the sfr keeps on increasing to reach eventually the level of gas input . in this way one can draw an important though not unexpected conclusion : the sfr in a disc adjusts itself to the amount of gas that is being supplied .",
    "the time scale on which this happens is for the present simulation @xmath66 1 gyr , but will likely depend on the numerical resolution .",
    "when the images of the galaxy are inspected at 1.5 gyrs after the start of the simulation it appears that the morphology is only slightly dependent on the amount of gas supply and consequently also only slightly dependent on the actual sfr .",
    "more gas and higher sfr results in a somewhat stronger and less regular spiral pattern .",
    "when 8 @xmath119 is added also a few dense gas clouds develop .",
    "the v - band images as presented in the left column of fig .",
    "5 are made to resemble a galaxy as depicted in an optical photograph . to that aim the intensity is given on a square - root gray scale and cut off ( saturated ) above a certain level .",
    "there is always some subjectiveness involved in selecting the scale and cutoff and for the best result i aimed at achieving the best overall contrast . in reality , however , this will be equal to the process of developing and printing of actual photographs .",
    "a shortcoming of the simulations is the lack of dust .",
    "certainly the young sf regions in real galaxies are often ( at least partly ) enshrouded in some amount of dust , a situation that can not be reproduced .",
    "another problem is that every new star particle (= sf region ) has an imf going up to stars of 125 @xmath46 which will completely dominate the light in every passband . in a real galaxy",
    "there are only a few sf regions which contain such massive stars .",
    "to compensate , at least in part , for the lack of dust and for the discrete appearance of very massive stars , the v - band image is made for all the stars at an age 3  10@xmath48 years older than the actual age of the stars .",
    "the net effect of this procedure is an image less dominated by young star clusters .",
    "admittedly , there is some artificiality in creating a simulated v - band image to compare with photographs , but there is no way around this .",
    "when there is no sn action the v - band image is completely dominated by bright regions and to my knowledge such a galaxy does not exist .",
    "for @xmath72 = 5% the optical image is also very knotty and is barely consistent with the image of ngc 628 on , for example , page 99 of the shapley - ames catalog .",
    "when @xmath72 is larger the optical images are not unlike images of real galaxies .",
    "the problem with the stellar mass images is that these can not be observed . even in the near infrared passbands",
    "young populations will supply extra light , e.g. have a smaller m / l ratio compared to an old population .",
    "contrary to the optical and stellar mass image , the image of the gas can actually be compared with observed structures .",
    "high resolution observations of nearby late type galaxies are presented by a.o . braun ( 1995 ) and kamphuis ( 1993 ) .",
    "such a high resolution is necessary because one would like to compare the small scale gas structure and in particular the size and distribution of holes created by sn feedback .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "5 lower right panel shows lots of small holes and cavities in the inner region , all created by sn explosions .",
    "in addition , a particular feature of sn feedback are holes blown into the ridge of spiral arms .",
    "this can be witnessed in the same image at for example positions ( x , y ) = ( 5,-15 ) and ( -4,19 ) .",
    "the observations of the gas structure do never show the knotty and threaded gas structures as for @xmath72 = 0 and 5% .",
    "the best resemblance between simulations and observations is for @xmath72 around 25% , though also more amorphous gas structures resembling the structure for @xmath72 = 50% are observed .",
    "a complicating factor is that some of the nicest spiral structures are observed in galaxies with grand design spiral arms obviously caused by an interaction with other galaxies , for example m81 (= ngc 3037 ) . in such cases gas becomes aligned with the gravitational spiral disturbance , influencing its global appearance .",
    "this should be taken into account when comparing the simulated gas structures with real observations .",
    "the spiral structure which is generated in the present simulations of an isolated galaxy is the result of an equilibrium of four actions . on",
    "the one side cooling and dissipation accumulates the gas in threads and clumps .",
    "this is counteracted by fuv heating and sn feedback .",
    "if the latter action is too small the gas collapses completely into a few giant sf regions . on the other hand ,",
    "if the action of heating and sns is too large , warm gas get dispersed over the disc preventing the formation of any coherent structure . except for this amount of mechanical feedback",
    "the resulting gas and mass structures do not depend on details ( like imf , @xmath56 , etc ) of the star formation process ( see sect .",
    "5.1 and gi97 ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that these structures do not depend on the exact star formation recipe .",
    "the behaviour of the gas is the main cause of structure formation . as a result",
    "the underlying stellar mass distribution becomes disturbed and also in the stellar disc spiral arms are formed . in this way gas mass enhancements",
    "more or less swing amplify the stellar mass into a spiral structure .",
    "but this is probably not the whole story .",
    "if it were only the need of mass accumulations to generate spirals , then it is expected that the low @xmath72 situation with its specific clumps would generate the strongest spirals .",
    "obviously that is not the case .",
    "the gas enhancements really have to be wound up in spirals by the differential rotation to create an accompanying mass enhancement . a situation is established where shearing gas filaments swing amplify the underlying mass distribution into a transient small scale density wave .",
    "the latter appears as a spiral arm .",
    "more insight is gained when the simulation is played as a movie on the tv screen .",
    "it can then be noticed that coherent spiral features develop and exist for approximately half a rotation period .",
    "spiral arms are `` wound '' into existence and disappear by winding and stretching too much or by interaction with other spiral features .",
    "such interactions also create the typical bifurcation patterns of the arms often seen in real galaxies .",
    "not created in the present simulations are the grand design m=2 spirals witnessed in a few exemplary galaxies .",
    "these matters will be further investigated and discussed in sections 8 and 9 .",
    "an amount of sn feedback has now been determined which results in a good resemblance with observed structures in a disc while for a gas addition of 4 @xmath119 the gas reservoir remains constant .",
    "fixing these parameters and fixing the thickness parameter @xmath77 at 900 pc the resulting morphology for different disc contributions to the total rotation has been investigated .",
    "images of the galaxy after 1.5  10@xmath87 years of simulation are presented in fig . 8 for @xmath115 of 126 , 150 , 165 , and 180 . as for fig .",
    "5 , fig . 8 speaks pretty much for itself .",
    "discs with a moderate rotational contribution of 126 and 150 evolve into a regular spiral galaxy . for @xmath115 = 150",
    "there appear to be less arms which are more pronounced than in the case of @xmath115 = 126 . however , the images presented in fig .",
    "8 are only one snapshot at one particular time . during the simulations arms come and go and are variable in strength . judging",
    "the whole simulation from @xmath136 to @xmath137 1.5  10@xmath87 years the @xmath115 = 150 case has also on average a slightly more pronounced spiral structure .",
    "discs with a larger rotational contribution obviously develop a bar . for @xmath115 = 165",
    "the disc starts out by forming a few large and broad spiral structures , a situation which continues to @xmath66 1.2  10@xmath87 year .",
    "then quite suddenly the bar appears . for @xmath115 = 180",
    "the simulation also sets out by forming broad dominant spiral features which already after @xmath66 0.5  10@xmath87 years settle into a barred structure . when the bar is present gas is transported inwards rapidly along the bar .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by athanassoula ( 1992 ) for simulations of gas moving in a rigid barred potential .",
    "that study shows that the gas is transported inwards along shocks appearing on the leading side of the bar .",
    "the present calculations give the same results , though the resolution in not good enough to investigate details of this process .",
    "( 11.4,10.9 )    ( 5.7,5.1 )    in the bar the gas density is large , cooling is fast and new stellar particles form in appreciable quantities .",
    "so much young stars form at some positions and certainly at the centre that fuv heating outweighs the cooling and gas remains at @xmath66 10@xmath27  k while becoming ever more dense .",
    "when gas particles accumulate within the softening length numerical problems occur . to avoid these , the gas was forced to form new stars above a density limit of 10  pc@xmath36 even though the star formation criteria of subsection 2.4 were not yet satisfied .",
    "it was not intended and it is not possible to simulate the processes going on at the very centre of the bar region . what the simulations do show is that gas is transported inwards along the bar , where it forms stars at a considerable rate . as a consequence a concentration of young stars emerges at the inner few kpc which takes on a more or less spherical shape .",
    "this can be called the development of a bulge . for the whole galaxy the radial luminosity profile changes from exponential to freeman type ii ( freeman 1970 ) where the shoulders of the profile coincide with the bar .",
    "getting back to fig .",
    "8 , one can notice the effect of the inwards gas transport .",
    "for @xmath115 = 180 the bar has existed longer than for @xmath115 = 165 . as a consequence in case of @xmath115 = 180 the region around the bar",
    "has already been severely depleted of gas .",
    "the results of the present simulations of the barred galaxies are identical to those of friedli & benz ( 1995 ) .",
    "they also specifically report the gas inflow , sf along the bar and in the centre , and the formation of a bulge .",
    "but , do we need the gas to form or not to form bars ? to investigate this , the simulations presented in fig .",
    "8 have been re - run without gas . in order to obtain nearly the same density structure and same rotation curves",
    "the gas has been replaced by stellar particles which were given the same sech@xmath138 vertical distribution as the other stars .",
    "the resulting density structure after 1.5  10@xmath87 years is given in fig .",
    "9 . for @xmath115 = 165 and 180 the structure closely resembles the mass structure in case gas in included .",
    "only the central regions are less pronounced because no ( gas ) mass has been transported inwards . anyway , the conclusion is straightforward ; gas is not essential for the formation of bars , at least for the galactic constitution investigated presently .",
    "yet , when inspecting fig .",
    "9 for the cases of @xmath115 = 126 and 150 another fact is obvious .",
    "namely that gas is essential for the formation of spiral arms .",
    "if there is no gas the galactic disc is featureless , while if gas is included , the top two rows of fig .",
    "8 show that a rich spiral structure may develop .",
    "although in principle not applicable for global instabilities , toomre s ( 1964 ) @xmath1 criterion is often invoked to assess the dynamical state of a galactic disc .",
    "when rigorously applied , @xmath1 can then serve as a kind of galactic thermometer , but this rigorous application has its problems as we shall see .",
    "@xmath1 value indicates when an infinitely thin pure stellar disc becomes unstable to local instabilities .",
    "it is defined as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the stellar surface density and @xmath93 the epicyclic frequency given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the circular test particle rotation .",
    "@xmath1 is thus defined there where the epicyclic approximation holds , meaning @xmath143 .",
    "this leads to the first reason why the @xmath1 criterion does not apply for bars .",
    "bars develop in the central regions of galaxies which have a large disc mass contribution . at exactly these regions and for those circumstances the epicyclic approximation clearly does not hold .",
    "the second reason is , of course , that it is a local and not a global criterion .    to give the @xmath1 thermometer for the four simulations of fig .",
    "8 it has been calculated as a function of radius .",
    "this calculation involves a third problem ; what to use for @xmath142 and for @xmath140 in case of a disc with both stars and gas ?",
    "if dispersions are small the stellar rotation @xmath94 is nearly equal to the testparticle ( @xmath66 gas ) rotation and it does not matter whether one inserts @xmath144 or @xmath145 for @xmath142 .",
    "but in the inner regions of massive discs the asymmetric drift is large and it does matter for the value of @xmath1 which rotation is used .",
    "inclusion of a gas component will decrease the effective @xmath1 value as demonstrated for a thin disc by bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) . for a real galaxy a straightforward recipe for the conversion of @xmath1 so as to include the gas can not be given . to make a first attempt one might substitute @xmath146 for the surface density @xmath140 in eq .",
    "( 20 ) . in this way",
    "i was lead to define two @xmath1 values , a pure stellar one ( @xmath147 ) defined as @xmath148 and a @xmath149 given by @xmath150 the two of which should give an unambiguous description of the value and range of the @xmath1 thermometer .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "the replacement of @xmath144 by @xmath145 has an effect on @xmath1 only at the inner regions .",
    "on the other hand , for large radii and especially for the least massive discs the inclusion of the gas surface density leads to a substantial decrease of @xmath1 .",
    "only the two most massive discs form a bar .",
    "reading the @xmath1 thermometer in fig .",
    "10 it can be noticed that for these galaxies both @xmath147 and @xmath149 fall below 1.2 at certain inner radii .",
    "it is also at these positions where the bar eventually develops .",
    "further simulations with different galaxy constitutions ( next subsection ) show that a level of @xmath151 for any minimum @xmath1 is indeed critical for bar ( in)stability .",
    "there is a small complication , however . as noted in subsection 4.6 , an initially constant vertical to radial velocity dispersion ratio of 0.6 changes into a different functionality expressed in the function @xmath90 of eq .",
    "( 12 ) and displayed in fig .",
    "4 . for discs with @xmath152 150",
    "the setup has been adapted to accommodate this changing dispersion ratio . for @xmath115 = 126",
    "this was not necessary because that situation settles gently , without mass transport into a stable state with a specific @xmath90 .",
    "but a different dispersion ratio results in a different @xmath1 value .",
    "if the disc mass is fixed , @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath153 which means that if @xmath90 is larger than 1.0 as it is in the inner regions , @xmath1 is smaller than when the dispersion ratio were 0.6 everywhere . as a consequence , for @xmath115 = 126 @xmath1 evolves to slightly lower values a demonstrated in fig .",
    "10 by also showing @xmath154 after 1.5 gyrs . for @xmath115 = 150",
    "the radial functionality of @xmath147 after 1.5 gyrs is indistinguishable from the @xmath136 situation demonstrating that the input @xmath90 was close to its eventual value .",
    "equation ( 24 ) shows another important relation . to increase @xmath1 by making the disc thicker is not easy .",
    "for example , to bring up @xmath1 from 1.0 to a stable @xmath155 , the value of @xmath77 has to be increased by a factor four .",
    "this changes @xmath156 into @xmath157 and the disc is in principle not a disc any more .",
    "the matter of bar ( in)stability has been further investigated by performing a number of simulations for discs with various masses and thicknesses . as noted above , the stability depends on the precise value of @xmath90 and as a consequence an initial situation should be close to having its equilibrium vertical to radial dispersion ratio .",
    "for the four different disc masses with belonging maximum rotation a good approximation to this equilibrium was found by the functionality given in fig .",
    "4 . in each case",

    "a bar can be generated when the disc is made thin and cool enough .",
    "on the other hand , for the maximum disc case of @xmath115 = 180 it seems impossible to avoid a bar . for a very thick disc with @xmath77 = 1300 pc",
    "a bar still appears . to make the disc even thicker",
    ", one needs large stellar velocity dispersions and the epicyclic approximation can not be applied over most of the radial extent .",
    "a determination of the proper asymmetric drift then becomes problematic .",
    "for the more massive discs a long bar develops , while the size of the bar decreases towards the less massive discs .",
    "the dependence of this bar length on the thickness of the disc seems to be small . in this way",
    "one might determine the disc contribution to the total rotation for a barred galaxy by relating the length of the bar to the scalelength of the disc .",
    "unfortunately , the radial photometric profile of barred galaxies is often of an extreme freeman type ii ( freeman 1970 ) making it difficult to assign a scalelength .",
    "the simulations of barred galaxies also show such an evolution towards type ii and suggest that the original scalelength can best be retrieved by taking a global average of the eventual profile in the logarithmic domain .    in fig .",
    "11 a number of sampling points are given alongside the instability threshold .",
    "of course , more intermediate cases could have been simulated but the results now gathered already give a good impression . when the unstable ( u ) and stable ( s ) data points of fig .",
    "11 are plotted in a log@xmath160 versus @xmath161 plane , a division by a straight line into a stable and unstable section can be made .",
    "this dimensionless division line is parameterized by @xmath162 which has been converted to @xmath159 and is plotted as the dashed line in fig .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath115 = 180 indicates that a stable disc for that case should be achieved approximately near @xmath163 or @xmath77 = 1450 pc , which represents a puffed up disc rarely seen in reality ( van der kruit & searle 1982 ; kregel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "obviously , this criterion is derived for one specific galactic constitution and its general , dimensionless applicability should be further assessed .",
    "does it hold , for example , for a different @xmath164 ?",
    "an indication that it indeed holds comes from the study of bottema & gerritsen ( 1997 ) where a similar stability change over has been established for a disc with @xmath164 = 120 .",
    "the applicability of eq .",
    "( 25 ) will diminish when the galaxy is appreciably different from the late type spiral studied in this paper .",
    "for example if the disc deviates from exponential , when there is a substantial bulge , or when the gas content is much larger .",
    "it is not expected that medium differences in gas content will play an important role because as we already saw , the bar develops just as well with or without gas .",
    "a more general discussion , mainly relating to other stability criteria will be given in sect .",
    "as described above , before the bar develops the disc exhibits some strong spiral features .",
    "these features are transient and as a consequence the disc heats up , possibly aided by additional scattering on gas accumulations or clouds .",
    "when a bar is present the surrounding disc is heated by emanating arms of variable strength .",
    "this heating leads to an increased disc thickness which is indicated by the arrows towards larger @xmath77 values in fig .",
    "as can be seen , when a disc is more unstable the heating and thickening is larger , a result which does not come as a surprise .",
    "noteworthy is the fact that in general when the disc becomes thicker it remains approximately equally thick at all radii .",
    "this even holds for the barred region where the thickness is rigorously calculated as the azimuthally averaged rms z - height and using @xmath165 .",
    "only when a bulge develops from gas transported inwards the thickness remains small or even becomes smaller in the bulge region .",
    "the present simulations are performed with a rigid , `` dead '' , bulge and dark halo potential .",
    "what might change when instead , the bulge and halo would be composed of a collection of particles ? to answer this question one has to distinguish between two aspects :    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     let s first consider item a. in first instance the development of the bar depends on the potential of the halo and bulge .",
    "a more massive halo or bulge increases the potential energy and stabilizes against bar formation . for the bulge",
    "there is an additional effect . when the bulge becomes more massive an ilr",
    "is forced by the higher circular speed near the centre which frustrates the bar formation ( toomre 1981 ; sellwood & evans 2001 ) .",
    "these effects are the result of a deeper , azimuthally symmetric , potential well and consequently changing from a dead to a life mass distribution will not alter the formation of the bar and the stability criterion of eq .",
    "( 25 ) remains valid .",
    "in second instance , however , during the process of bar formation there might be a difference if the halo and/or bulge were alive .",
    "a life component allows angular momentum transfer more easily and resonances between disc and halo might occur . because the maximum disc case ( @xmath115 = 180 ) has a relatively light halo it is feasible to perform a numerical calculation with a life dark halo composed of not too massive particles",
    "this has actually been done , using 70k halo plus bulge , 70k disc , and 16k gas particles .",
    "the result is nearly identical to the case with a rigid halo and bulge as presented in the bottom row of fig .  8 , both during and at the end of the simulation after 1.5 gyrs .",
    "this proves that for at least this situation a dynamical interaction between an emerging bar with a surrounding life component is not important .",
    "bar persistence ( item b ) is a different story .",
    "when an already barred galaxy is embedded in a life , non rotating isotropic dark halo , the bar is slowed down by dynamical friction ( debattista & sellwood 1998 ) .",
    "eventually the bar will then dissolve .",
    "this slowing down is severe when the galaxy is considerably sub maximum and is nearly absent when close to a maximum disc situation .",
    "the initial situation of debattista & sellwood is , of course , rather specific and in reality a dark halo will acquire some rotation during galaxy formation ( tremaine & ostriker 1999 ) . according as a halo rotates faster ,",
    "the dynamical friction process is less severe and so in reality the bar dissolution will be less strong than debattista & sellwood claim .",
    "nevertheless , if the simulations were to be performed with a life halo there would be a dynamical influence on the persistence of the bar . fortunately ,",
    "as demonstrated above , bars which develope in a more sub maximum disc situation tend to be smaller .",
    "such bars then reside in a region where the disc density is still larger than the dark halo density .",
    "consequently the slowing down mechanism will only be slightly active if the halo were life .",
    "the mechanism of debattista & sellwood is important for sub maximum discs with large bars , a situation that maybe never occurs in reality .",
    "a life bulge may , just as a life halo , also influence the persistence of an already existing bar by dynamical friction .",
    "in addition one might imagine that a small bulge becomes aligned with the bar , enforcing its presence .",
    "concerning bulges , it should be kept in mind that the investigated galaxy has only a small bulge ; the surface density of the bulge is larger than that of the disc for radii less than 0.9 kpc . the bars which develope are generally much larger than that extent , and any effect of a life bulge on",
    "the bar is therefore minor . for an earlier type galaxy with larger bulge",
    "the situation might be different .",
    "it would be , nevertheless , interesting to investigate numerically the effects of a life bulge and halo on the persistence of the bar .",
    "but that is less simple than it might seem . at first ,",
    "realistic and preferably slightly rotating halos and bulges have to be created .",
    "secondly , halos are massive and large numbers of particles have to be used .",
    "if , instead , one replaces the halo ( and bulge ) with less and more massive particles inevitably stochastic heating of the bar and surrounding disc will occur .",
    "the bar then dissolves by a numerical effect and drawing conclusions is difficult .",
    "a good assessment of the state of the gas can be obtained by plotting the position for every sph particle in a temperature  density diagram .",
    "two of such diagnostic plots are shown in fig .",
    "12 for two exemplary cases : @xmath115 = 126 with @xmath77 = 675 pc and @xmath115 = 165 with @xmath77 = 900 pc . in all the simulations a typical `` rain - cloud '' structure develops .",
    "most of the gas resides around 10@xmath27  k which is the equilibrium between fuv heating and the practical upper limit set to the temperature by the cooling function . in circumstances of high density and/or low fuv flux gas",
    "may cool and starts to rain down from the cloud .",
    "the solid line indicates the jeans instability threshold .",
    "if a gas particle falls below this line and remains there for a period greater than @xmath166 , half its mass is converted into a stellar particle and the other half into a hot sn particle .",
    "this rain - cloud structure represents a rather uneasy and dynamical equilibrium state .",
    "if , for example , the fuv flux is removed , nearly all the gas falls to low temperatures within two time steps . only at low densities gas",
    "may remain warm by the cr heating .",
    "not shown in the diagnostic plot is the hot sn gas .",
    "this gas has a temperature around 1.25  10@xmath48  k ( for @xmath72 = 25% ) and densities in the range of 0.002 to 0.2  @xmath167 .",
    "if the hot sn phase is switched off the gas particles generally move back to the 10@xmath27  k phase very quickly . when a bar develops , as for @xmath115 = 165 ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "12 ) a typical extension on the 10@xmath27  k cloud towards high density appears .",
    "in such cases inwards transport of gas generates numerous young stars of which the heating outweighs the intrinsic cooling .",
    "four temperature ranges have been defined : cold for @xmath168 1000  k , luke warm for 1000  k @xmath169 8000  k , warm for 8000  k @xmath170 10@xmath45  k , and hot ( sn ) for @xmath171 10@xmath45  k. for the top panel in fig .",
    "12 with @xmath115 = 126 the total amount of gas is 18.7  10@xmath87 @xmath46 of which 13.1  10@xmath87 @xmath46 resides in the stellar disc region , where @xmath172 25 kpc . of this amount , 18.5%",
    ", 25.9% , 54.8% , and 0.9% is in the cold , luke warm , warm , and hot phase respectively . in case of @xmath115 = 165 , given in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "12 the total amount of gas is 17.9  10@xmath87 @xmath46 of which 12.1  10@xmath87 @xmath46 is at @xmath173 25 kpc .",
    "division of that last amount into the cold to hot phases gives fractions of 15.8% , 20.6% , 62.6% , and 1.1% .",
    "there is a considerable amount of luke warm gas ; in most cases even more than the amount of cold gas . even if one were to increase the cold fraction by increasing the @xmath58 parameter ( eq .",
    "8) then still the same amount of luke warm gas remains .",
    "this fact is caused by the abovementioned uneasy and dynamical equilibrium state of the gas .",
    "sph particles are continuously dropping out of the rain - cloud by natural cooling and are pushed up there again by heating . in a manner",
    ", this contradicts the proposed notion of a two phase ism ( field et al .",
    "1969 ) or three phase ism ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "although artificially implemented the hot sn state of the gas can be considered as the hot phase of this three phase ism model .",
    "the whole process of cloud collapse , division in smaller fractions , further collapse , star formation , bubble formation , etc , is extremely complex and not well understood .",
    "but anyway , if at a region gas cools and starts to collapse it takes a certain amount of time for the first stars to appear . in the present simulations this",
    "is implemented by requiring a certain time span @xmath166 ( eq . 8) the gas has to remain jeans unstable and thus cold before it may form stars .",
    "the longer @xmath166 , the more cold gas is present and one would like to fix this parameter by comparing simulated warm to cold gas ratios with actually observed ratios in spiral galaxies .",
    "moreover , the effect of the amount of sn feedback appears to be slightly related to the amount of cold gas and so related to @xmath166 .",
    "unfortunately , observations to determine this ratio are difficult and the ensuing analysis is ambiguous . in our local galactic neighbourhood it seems that cold and warm are evenly divided ( kulkarni & heiles 1987 , payne et al .",
    "1983 ) , though there appears to be luke warm gas ( kalberla et al . 1985 ) as well , which considerably complicates the analysis . for external galaxies",
    "the presence of cold gas has been established ( braun 1997 , young & lo 1996 ) yet the amount is undetermined . comparing galaxies , dickey & brinks ( 1993 )",
    "demonstrate that the ratio of cold to warm gas may differ considerably from system to system yet its absolute value depends on the unknown temperature ( or temperature range ) of the cold gas .",
    "finally i came to conclude that , as for now , the observations allow a fraction of cold gas anywhere between 15 and 80% .",
    "this is all rather disappointing and means that not much more can be done than quoting gas ratios for the various simulations .",
    "there are , nevertheless , two interesting facts predicted by the simulations . at first the presence of a sizable amount of luke warm gas .",
    "secondly , a large cold gas fraction leads to excessive clumping and giant sf regions .",
    "if the ratio of cold to warm does appear to be large in an actual galaxy , an additional stabilization mechanism is needed for the cold gas . in this respect magnetic fields",
    "might be a good candidate .",
    "an important result of the research by kennicutt ( 1989 ) is that the schmidt law holds for the total ( h@xmath44 @xmath174 ) gas surface density .",
    "this means that the h@xmath44 in the inner regions of galaxies actively participates in generating instabilities and the ensuing star formation . as for most late type galaxies ,",
    "also in the inner regions of ngc 628 there is a gradual increase of the h@xmath44/ratio ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . following the result of kennicutt , the total gas should and",
    "has been included in the simulations .",
    "but there is a problem .",
    "h@xmath44 is in a dense region where according to the schmidt law there is a lot of sf and consequently a high fuv field .",
    "that field should quickly dissociate the existing h@xmath44 . in real galaxies",
    "this does not happen and thus another process is needed to maintain the h@xmath44 which is not incorporated in the simulations .    above a certain density threshold the atomic gas becomes molecular .",
    "this threshold depends on the pressure , the radiation field , and metals plus dust .",
    "especially dust is needed to shield the molecules from photodestruction ( elmegreen 1993 ) . in addition dust",
    "allows h@xmath44 to form on grain surfaces ( hollenbach & salpeter 1971 ) . therefore dust explains , at least for a large part , why h@xmath44 can exist in the presence of the high fuv field .",
    "but this also means that at positions with large h@xmath44 column densities there has to be more dust than at other positions .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding of huizinga & van albada ( 1992 ) that absorption in galaxies mainly takes place in the inner regions .",
    "remains the problem that in the simulations the h@xmath44 is simply replaced with additional gas . as noted in the beginning of this subsection , that has to be done to be able to follow the schmidt law .",
    "yet at the central regions of a real galaxy heating and cooling might proceed differently compared to the mechanism .",
    "it will likely proceed at lower temperature regimes and fuv flux will be attenuated by the extra dust . nevertheless one does not expect heating and cooling to be substantially different because the same metal ions responsible for the cooling ( c@xmath175 and o@xmath176 ) are present . compared to dynamical time scales sf is fast and in a practical numerical sense always takes place in a few timesteps . considering this , and the presence of only a moderate amount of h@xmath44 ( 8.5% )",
    ", it seems reasonable that the replacement of h@xmath44 by in the simulations will not result in errors on scales larger than the employed spatial and time resolution .",
    "if there is no sn feedback but only fuv heating the resulting gas velocity dispersion is in the range of 4 to 7 in the stellar disc region .",
    "when sns are included the gas can be stirred up to higher dispersions as was noted by gerritsen ( 1997 ) . for a simulation with @xmath115 = 126 , @xmath77 = 675 pc using 40k gas particles ( see next section ) the resulting velocity dispersion at @xmath137 1.5  10@xmath87 years is plotted in fig .",
    "13 . by the way , for 16k gas particles",
    "the result is identical .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "13 that the velocity dispersion decreases when going to larger radii .",
    "this is caused by less star formation taking place further out in the disc and consequently there is less sn action , being less able to stir up the gas .",
    "what is interesting is that the radial velocity dispersion is significantly larger than the dispersion in the other directions , similar to the stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "the actually observed gas z - velocity dispersion in ngc 628 ( kamphuis 1993 , van der hulst 1996 ) is also given in fig .",
    "there is a good agreement between the observations and simulations , which suggests that the employed mechanism of sn feedback quite accurately simulates the processes taking place in reality .",
    "actually matters are more complicated than suggested in the paragraph above . at first because the hydrodynamics is approximated by a finite resolution numerical scheme . secondly because the gas in a real galaxy is not a continuous medium , but a hierarchical ensemble of clouds .",
    "this ensemble of clouds can not be considered as a fluid in equilibrium . the clouds and thus the can be heated by gravitational scattering . in that case",
    "a velocity dispersion is predicted of 5 to 7 independent of cloud mass ( jog & ostriker 1988 , gammie et al .",
    "additional heating can , of course , take place through kinetic energy input by sns .",
    "it is unclear if , and how accurately the numerical scheme is able to describe the detailed process of heating for an ensemble of clouds .",
    "an indication that there is indeed such a shortcoming is the simulated low dispersion values at radii beyond 30 kpc : 2 to 3 is simulated while 5 to 7 is predicted and observed . obviously the simulated gas is not discrete enough or too viscous .",
    "in order to make a more detailed analysis of spiral structure it appeared beneficial to increase the number of gas particles from 16.000 to 40.000 , giving a gas mass per sph particle of 4.7  10@xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "simulations with the increased number of gas particles show lots more details and structure . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "14 the resulting structure is displayed for four cases which have been investigated for various reasons .",
    "the top two rows are for a galaxy with maximum disc rotation of 126 , @xmath77 = 675 pc , @xmath72 = 25% and adding 4 @xmath119 of new gas .",
    "15a is after a simulation time of 1.5 gyrs and , except for the larger particle number , is equal to the situation in fig .",
    "5c . comparing",
    "the two one can notice that especially in the inner regions more gas particles gives a more pronounced spiral structure . in the outer regions the spiral arms are more continuous , less flocculent , and contain fewer star formation spots .",
    "overall , the general appearance of the mass and gas distribution and of the spiral structure has not changed by using more gas particles .",
    "this implies that medium and large scale structures which are generated do not depend on the employed particle number .",
    "a quantitative analysis of structures can thus be made and the result should be generally valid .    in fig .",
    "14b the simulation of fig .",
    "14a has been continued untill 3 gyrs to investigate disc heating and the effect of an increased young population of stars .",
    "the lower two rows of fig .",
    "14 are for a galaxy with maximum disc rotation of 150 , @xmath77 = 900 pc ( 14c ) and @xmath77 = 675 pc ( 14d ) at @xmath137 1.5 gyrs .",
    "these two simulations are on opposite sides of the bar instability threshold for that maximum disc rotation .",
    "14c is , except for the larger particle number , equal to fig . 8b and the same conclusions apply as for the comparison of the @xmath115 = 126 discs , given above .",
    "a long simulation of a stable disc provided the possibility to investigate the evolution of the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "new stars are formed at a rate of approximately 4 @xmath119 with an original velocity dispersion equal to that of the gas . over a time span of a few gyrs these young stars",
    "will acquire an ever larger velocity dispersion .",
    "the proven stable disc with @xmath115 = 126 and @xmath77 = 675 pc was simulated for 3 gyrs using 150k stellar , and 40k gas particles .",
    "for the whole period gas was added to the system at a rate of 4 @xmath119 to compensate for the gas consumption by star formation . at @xmath137 3 gyrs , the situation displayed in fig .",
    "14b , the then available stars were divided in five age groups .",
    "the youngest stars have an age @xmath177 0.75 gyrs , there are three groups with ages between 0.75 to 1.5 gyrs , 1.5 to 2.25 gyrs , and 2.25 to 3 gyrs , and there is a group of old stars present from the onset of the simulation , thus having an age @xmath47 3 gyrs . at radii of 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20",
    "kpc the velocity dispersion in both the radial and vertical direction was determined of these age groups .",
    "the result is given as a function of the square root of the age of each group in fig .",
    "15 . in this way",
    "the evolution of the dispersion can be monitored at each radial position .",
    "as can been seen , the increase in dispersion is nicely consistent with a square root of age functionality .",
    "after 3 gyrs the dispersion of the old population has not yet been reached . if one extrapolates the data points to larger ages , then on average , after @xmath66 6.5 gyrs the dispersion of the old , equilibrium population of stars will be reached .",
    "an overview of the rates and the mechanisms of disc heating is given by binney & tremaine ( 1987 , p. 470 - 484 ) and by lacey ( 1991 ) . in short , the collisionless stellar ensemble of a stellar disc can be heated by three principal mechanisms .",
    "firstly , heating by molecular clouds ( spitzer & schwarzschild 1953 , villumsen 1985 ) , which generates heating @xmath178 .",
    "secondly , heating by transient spiral features ( carlberg & sellwood 1985 ) which is more efficient and heats @xmath179 but molecular clouds are needed in addition to generate vertical heating .",
    "a third mechanism is heating by the infall of small satellite galaxies .",
    "stellar heating as observed in the solar neighbourhood indicates that the heating , or increase in velocity dispersion , proceeds proportional to @xmath180 ( wielen 1977 ) so that the more effective spiral arm heating is needed to explain this observation .    the simulation of fig .",
    "14a and b actually includes , both heating by simulated molecular clouds ( conglomerates of gas particles ) , and heating by transient spiral arms .",
    "it should therefore give a reasonable description of heating as occurring in real galactic discs .",
    "as witnessed in fig .",
    "15 the simulated heating is indeed consistent with a proportionality @xmath179 , as observed in our galaxy and predicted by spiral arm heating .",
    "however , as mentioned in sect .",
    "4.4 the simulation is only collisionless for @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , for radii larger than @xmath66 9 kpc the simulations have additional heating by particle scattering .",
    "this will generate heating time scales being shorter than for real galaxies , certainly at the radial positions of 15 and 20 kpc .",
    "my original perception concerning the creation of spiral structure was that its origin lies in an underlying young and cold stellar fraction . to investigate this assumption , for two stable discs (",
    "@xmath115 = 126 , @xmath77 = 675 pc and @xmath115 = 150 with @xmath77 = 900 pc ) long simulations using 40k gas particles have been performed until 3  10@xmath87 years . during this time",
    "young stars have been created at a rate of @xmath66 4 @xmath119 at the position and with the kinematics of the gas layer .",
    "the result was disappointing .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "14a and b , the spiral structure might be marginally stronger at 3 gyrs compared to that after 1.5 gyrs .",
    "however , if the whole time sequence for this @xmath115 = 126 run is inspected then there are no gradual changes any more after @xmath66 1 gyrs",
    ". there are fluctuations in the appearance and strength of the spiral arms over periods of @xmath66 0.2 gyrs which is illustrated as the difference between fig .",
    "14a and fig .",
    "the same conclusion applies for the @xmath115 = 150 , @xmath77 = 900 pc case ( fig .",
    "if the addition of gas is stopped after 1.5 gyrs , the sfr decreases to @xmath66 2 @xmath119 at @xmath137 3 gyrs and the spiral structure slowly fades away .",
    "in retrospect this failure of a young population to generate a more pronounced spiral structure can be understood .",
    "for example , the @xmath115 = 126 disc has a total stellar mass of 45.5  10@xmath87 @xmath46 . during the simulations",
    "cold stars are added at a rate of 4 @xmath119 .",
    "after 1 gyrs the cold stellar fraction then amounts to 4  10@xmath87 @xmath46 , and after 3 gyrs to 12  10@xmath87 @xmath46 which is approximately 20% of the then available total stellar mass .",
    "however , the stars which were formed first are then not young and cold any more because of stellar heating . as can be seen in fig .",
    "15 , after 3 gyrs , the stars with that age have increased their velocity dispersion to more than half of that of the old population .",
    "considering the numbers and heating rates , the mass fraction of a reasonably cold stellar population will not surpass the amount of 20% .",
    "such a fraction might locally destabilize the disc to some extent but will never become a dominant mechanism .",
    "the total mass of a disc with @xmath115 = 150 is 64.5  10@xmath87 @xmath46 . in that case for a sfr of 4 @xmath119 the mass fraction of cold stars is approximately 10% , being a factor two smaller than for the @xmath115 = 126 disc . for a more massive disc , with the same gas content it would thus be even more difficult to create instabilities by the cold stellar population process , and vice versa , of course .",
    "some additional experiments have been carried out by adding large quantities of gas during the beginning of the simulations . as a result",
    "the sfr goes up and a larger cold stellar fraction is generated .",
    "the spiral structure then becomes more pronounced , but subsides to its usual state once the extra gas flow is stopped . in these cases",
    "it is not clear whether the more pronounced spiral structure is generated by the larger cold stellar fraction or by the larger amount of gas which is present .",
    "since an increased cold stellar fraction barely enhances the spiral structure , the influence of other parameters has been investigated .",
    "it was apparent from the investigation of sect .",
    "5 that spiral structure is mainly caused by shearing gas structures and an increased fraction of cold gas might enhance such a process .",
    "for the situation of fig .",
    "14c , @xmath115 = 150 and @xmath77 = 900 pc , the collapse factor @xmath58 ( eq .",
    "8) has been increased by a factor four in combination with or without a change of the supernova efficiency .",
    "a larger collapse factor produces more cold gas , which is colder and has densities up to a factor of 10 larger .",
    "the gas arms are thinner and more threadlike and tend to form gas clumps which cause strong star formation regions . for a combination of @xmath182 and a low sn efficiency of @xmath72 = 10%",
    "the image is like the top rows of fig .",
    "5 and not like any actual galaxy . consequently ,",
    "the attempt to make more massive gas concentrations by increasing the cold gas fraction and lowering the sn dispersal mechanism is successful , but produces the familiar clumps and does not enhance a global spiral pattern . letting @xmath72 remain at 25% or making it larger in combination with a larger cold gas fraction does generate the more threadlike gas structure , but does not create larger or significantly smaller spiral disturbances in the underlying stellar density structure .",
    "what this investigation makes clear is that the generated spiral structure as it is in fig .",
    "14c is only weakly dependent on the exact value of the gas parameters .",
    "putting it in other words , a significant change of cold gas fraction or supernova efficiency does not lead to large changes in the spiral structure morphology .",
    "the standard cooling function applied to the situation of ngc 628 leads to a slightly large value of the observable sfr , when compared with what is actually observed .",
    "such a large sfr had the advantage of quickly generating an appreciable amount of young and cold stars of which the effect on the emerging spiral structure could be investigated . since",
    "such effects are demonstrated to be minor , the cooling function can be changed so as to generate a lower sfr .",
    "this has been investigated for the present case ( @xmath115 = 150 , @xmath77 = 900 pc ) by lowering the sfr to @xmath66 2@xmath116 @xmath119 and adding only 2 @xmath119 of gas constantly .",
    "it appears that there are no noticeable differences in the generated spiral structure compared to a situation with a larger sfr . from this",
    "follows that spiral structure at low gas suppletion rates can be sustained longer if the cooling of the gas is less efficient .",
    "one can conclude that small and medium scale spiral structure as displayed in fig .",
    "14a to c can be generated in an isolated spiral disc , for a large range of gas parameters .",
    "the principle factor determining the strength of the spiral structure is the surface density of the gaslayer .",
    "however , it is not possible to create autonomously a large scale spiral density wave .",
    "if the disc is thinner and colder and crosses the threshold of bar instability the bar can then drive an @xmath183 spiral structure as demonstrated in fig",
    ". 14d .",
    "one would like to compare the spiral structure produced by the simulations with the actual spiral structure in real galaxies in some quantitative way .",
    "for example , the number of spiral arms , their shape , and strength . astonishingly only a small amount of research has been carried out in this respect and a comparison of simulations with observations is only marginally possible .",
    "the shapes of spiral arms are generally well represented by a logarithmic functionality ( danver 1942 , kennicutt 1981 ) as @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the position on the arms with belonging angle @xmath99 and @xmath186 is the pitch angle . rewriting eq .",
    "( 26 ) gives @xmath187 .",
    "when the density structure of a ( face - on ) galaxy is rebinned to a @xmath188 plane , logarithmic spirals show up as straight lines .",
    "derivation of the pitch angles for each arm is straightforward and the number of crossings of one feature over the @xmath189 long @xmath99 axis gives the @xmath190-mode of the feature . on various occasions simulations",
    "have been displayed in such a plane and the simulated arms are always well represented by a logarithmic shape .",
    "however , @xmath188 planes are not easily comparable because there is in fact too much and too dispersed information .",
    "one would like to reduce the information into less and more informative numbers .",
    "one method to do this has been explored by considre & athanassoula ( 1982 , 1988 ) .",
    "it involves a fourier transform of the image of the galaxy into a superposition of global @xmath190-armed logarithmic spirals following kalnajs ( 1975 ) .",
    "a two dimensional grid @xmath191 is transformed into fourier coefficients @xmath192 by @xmath193 } { { \\sum}_i { \\sum}_j w_{ij } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath194 is the wavenumber , @xmath190 the mode and @xmath195 the value at gridpoint @xmath196 .",
    "the pitch angle @xmath186 is given by @xmath197 at the wavenumber where @xmath198 has its largest amplitude .",
    "considre & athanassoula ( 1988 ) present the calculated fourier coefficients in their fig .",
    "5 for 16 spiral galaxies , among which are a number known to have a well developed grand design structure . for most of the galaxies",
    "the coefficients @xmath198 rarely surpass the level of 0.1 .",
    "notable exceptions are ngc 5247 @xmath199 and ngc 6946 @xmath200 , but these two galaxies both have exceptionally large pitch angles of 26 and 32  respectively .",
    "considre & athanassoula claim that the two - armed component is everywhere dominant , but a close inspection of their data shows that only for 8 out of 16 galaxies @xmath0 is dominant , while for 6 out of 16 the @xmath201 component dominates ! surely this indicates that a number of systems have undergone some kind of interaction .",
    "ngc 628 is in the sample and shows a maximum @xmath202 of 0.16 with a pitch angle of 16 .",
    "in addition there is a peak for @xmath203 at a level of 0.09 with pitch angle of 28 .    for the v - band images of the simulated galaxies in fig .",
    "14 the fourier coefficients for modes one to five have been calculated following eq .",
    "( 27 ) and are displayed in fig .",
    "16 . in general the peak values",
    "do not exceed the level of 0.1 , as for most of the real galaxies , in fact .",
    "16 is only one snapshot ; if the fourier coefficients are monitored over a time span , peaks come and go for modes 2 to 5 .",
    "time scales are typically 0.2 gyrs and levels are comparable to those displayed in fig .",
    "16a to c. this behaviour reflects the episodical nature of the small and medium scale spiral structure during the simulations . for fig .",
    "16d , the barred galaxy , peaks are more constantly present .",
    "the simulations are supposed to represent ngc 628 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "16 , the values of the fourier coefficients do not reach the observed value .",
    "in addition , simulated pitch angles are somewhat too large .",
    "although the simulated v - band images reasonably resemble images of actual galaxies , the observed image of ngc 628 ( for example on page 99 of the shapley - ames catalog , sandage & tammann 1981 ) shows arms which are longer and less open .",
    "this means that the real galaxy ngc 628 exhibits more a grand design than its simulated counterpart .",
    "a further discussion of this matter will follow in sect .",
    "as determined by kennicutt ( 1981 ) , pitch angles of late type galaxies lie in the range between 12 and 30  and have a median value of 18 . as such ,",
    "the pitch angles of the simulated galaxies are slightly large but certainly not unusual .",
    "note that for the galaxies in common to the samples of considre & athanassoula and kennicutt the derived pitch angles are in good agreement .",
    "but this brings me to the question : how representative are both these samples for an average galaxy ?",
    "probably not representative at all . for both samples , galaxies are selected at least partly , for having a grand design or otherwise well delineated spiral structure .",
    "inevitably this produces a severe bias towards high amplitude spiral signal and probably towards smaller pitch angles .",
    "an alternative way to analyse spiral structure has been employed by a.o .",
    "elmegreen et al . ( 1989 , 1992 ) , rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) , and fuchs & mllenhoff ( 1999 ) .",
    "according to this method , first the underlying smooth galactic distribution is removed .",
    "then the residual is divided up in a number of circular annuli of which the brightness @xmath204 is fourier analysed with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath205 : @xmath206 following fuchs & mllenhoff the coefficients @xmath207 will be displayed as a function of radius to obtain a direct and quantitative insight into the development of the multiplicity of the structure .",
    "a determination of the pitch angle of mode @xmath190 might be done by plotting the phase @xmath208 versus ln(radius ) , but this has not been investigated presently .",
    "the v - band images of fig .",
    "14 have been divided up into 35 equally wide annuli ranging from a radius of 0.5 to 25 kpc .",
    "after division by the continuum , the fourier coefficients of eq .",
    "( 28 ) were calculated and are displayed in fig .",
    "one may notice that a good impression can be obtained of the radial functionality of the multiplicity of the spiral structure . comparing fig .",
    "16 and fig .",
    "17 , certain features can be related and put at its proper radius .",
    "for example , in panel * a * the small @xmath0 signal originates from radii between 11 and 15 kpc , while the @xmath209 signal comes mainly from positions in the outer regions . in panel",
    "* b * the @xmath203 spiral with pitch angle of 29  can obviously be recognized in fig .",
    "17 . on the other hand , the small @xmath0 signal in panel * c * of fig .",
    "17 at radii @xmath177 3 kpc can not readily be seen in fig . 16c .",
    "such a feature appears small in relative units , but if this disturbance of @xmath66 15% is expressed in absolute values for ngc 628 it amounts to @xmath66 25 @xmath210 , which is certainly not negligible . expressed in relative units , fig .",
    "17 shows that the brightness fluctuations become larger at larger radii . in absolute units , however ,",
    "the signal dominates in the inner regions . for the barred galaxy in panel * d * it can be noticed that the @xmath0 inner bar drives the @xmath0 spiral arms further out , except for the small excursion to @xmath211 around a radius of 8 kpc .",
    "of course , during the simulation the spiral structure changes and consequently also its representation as given in fig .",
    "though this is a nice way to display the spiral structure of a galaxy , there is a major problem .",
    "there are hardly any observations which have been interpreted in this manner and hence a comparison between simulations and real data is not really possible .",
    "rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) give @xmath212 to @xmath213 values for @xmath214-band observations of 18 face - on spirals .",
    "their main intent was to investigate the lopsidedness of galaxies and thus they focussed on the @xmath212 coefficient .",
    "the near infrared data do not extend beyond three scalelengths and the values of the @xmath215 to @xmath213 coefficients over that radial extent are relatively small , yet consistent with the values in fig .",
    "17 . only fuchs & mllenhoff ( 1999 ) give a detailed fourier coefficient analysis for one galaxy : ngc 1288 . both , the values and radial functionality of the coefficients show a striking similarity with the simulations of non - barred galaxies .",
    "ngc 1288 is a regular , massive galaxy with clear spiral structure but has no grand design density wave permeating its disc . as such it is comparable with the simulations and the spiral structure shows a comparable morphology .",
    "the spiral structure which develops in the present numerical simulations of an isolated and bar stable galaxy appears to be generated by swing amplification .",
    "this phenomenon where small distortions can be severely amplified in a differentially rotating ( shearing ) disc was discoved by goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) and the theory has been elaborated by o.a .",
    "julian & toomre ( 1966 ) , toomre ( 1981 ) , athanassoula ( 1984 ) , and athanassoula et al . ( 1987 ) .",
    "as noted by toomre ( 1981 ) swing amplification is governed by a conspiracy between three processes : shear , shaking and self - gravity .",
    "each of these processes can be specified by a dimensionless parameter : @xmath216 , @xmath1 , and @xmath217 which are the shear rate , the familiar toomre s @xmath1 parameter and as it is sometimes called toomre s @xmath217 parameter . in principle , swing amplification has been derived and quantified for a one component , infinitely thin disc using the epicyclic approximation . that is a simplification of reality which should be kept in mind when comparing results of the theory with findings for a real or numerical galaxy .    to investigate whether swing amplification is indeed the cause of the numerical spiral structure ,",
    "the theory has been applied to the galaxies displayed in fig .",
    "the three abovementioned parameters have to be calculated for the galactic constitution which leads again to the problem encountered in sect .",
    "6.2 of what to substitute for the rotation and surface density . as in sect .",
    "6.2 where two kinds of @xmath1 are defined also here two kinds of @xmath216 and @xmath217 will be defined ; pure stellar ( @xmath218 and @xmath219 ) given by @xmath220 @xmath221 and total or testparticle parameters ( @xmath222 and @xmath223 ) given by @xmath224 @xmath225 here @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the orbital and epicyclic frequencies , @xmath140 is the surface density and @xmath190 is the azimuthal multiplicity of the disturbance which is equal to the number of spiral arms . for the galaxies of fig .",
    "14a ( @xmath115 = 126 ,",
    "@xmath77 = 675 pc , @xmath226 = 1.5 gyrs ) and fig .",
    "14c ( @xmath115 = 150 , @xmath77 = 900 pc , @xmath226 = 1.5 gyrs ) the swing amplification parameters are given as a function of radius in fig .",
    "as can be seen , there is only a marginal difference between @xmath218 and @xmath222 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath217 parameter may differ substantially mainly depending on whether the gas surface density is , or is not included .",
    "athanassoula ( 1984 ) has calculated the maximum amplifications for a number of different values of the three dimensionless parameters . by interpolating her fig .",
    "26 , the amplification can thus be found .",
    "but this is a maximum amplification provided the arrival phase of the distortion is optimum .",
    "this means that for an actual case the amplification may be less , or zero , or the amplification of a distortion which emerges at a later time with more optimum arrival phase may approach this maximum limit .",
    "when viewed over a longer time span the spiral pattern will thus be rather variable just as witnessed in the simulations .",
    "inspection of athanassoula s fig .",
    "26 establishes some generalities , though . for a @xmath216 value between 0.5 and 1.0",
    "swing amplification is only effective for @xmath217 between typically 0.5 and 2.5 and has the largest amplifications when @xmath217 lies between 1.0 and 1.5 .",
    "a large value of @xmath1 dampens the amplification ; when @xmath227 the amplification is @xmath43 3 .",
    "when @xmath1 is low , say @xmath228 then the amplifications may exceed the value of 30 .",
    "for the present two galaxies of which the parameters are displayed in fig .",
    "18 the maximum amplifications have been derived as a function of radius . to that aim the pure stellar @xmath229 and total ( @xmath226 ) curves",
    "have simply been averaged using the assumption that the gas layer and its gravitation will influence the swing amplification process to some extent .",
    "if the amplifications would have been derived for both curves separately the emerging picture would not be essentially different .",
    "this is because an increasing @xmath1 value results in a decreasing amplification with a factor barely dependent on @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "a difference between the @xmath217 curves mainly appears at large values of @xmath217 where the amplification is small anyway .",
    "the maximum amplifications for modes 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and 12 are displayed as a function of radius in fig .",
    "one may notice that the smaller @xmath190-modes ( @xmath190 = 2 , 3 ) or the two and three armed spiral structures allow the largest amplification at the smaller radii .",
    "spiral structures with more arms will preferentially develop further out . at certain radii the amplifications for a number of different modes",
    "can approximately be equally large . in practice that means that the number of arms can , and likely will , change from time to time . for the less massive disc ( @xmath115 = 126 , top panel of fig .",
    "19 ) the amplifications reach at most a factor of four which is mainly caused by the relatively large value of @xmath1 . when that simulation is continued to 3 gyrs as displayed in fig .",
    "14b the swing amplification parameters barely change . consequently also the amplifications appropriate for that later time",
    "are equal to those already given for @xmath226 = 1.5 gyrs .",
    "if the disc is more massive ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "19 ) , @xmath1 is smaller and the allowed amplifications are larger certainly for the smaller @xmath190-modes . for the same disc but with a smaller thickness ( @xmath77 = 675 pc instead of 900 pc ) as in fig .",
    "14d the resulting @xmath1 parameter ( at @xmath226 = 0 ) is smaller while the @xmath217 and @xmath216 parameters remain nearly equal .",
    "the emerging amplification scheme for that thinner disc is then equal to that in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "19 except that all the amplifications have to be multiplied with a factor 2@xmath116 to 3 .",
    "that results in values between 30 and 40 for @xmath230 2 , 3 , and 4 at radii @xmath177 10 kpc .",
    "but , as we know a bar develops in that case which might be related to these allowed large amplifications .",
    "when one compares the amplifications given in fig . 19 with the actually emerging modes in fig .",
    "17 one may note the exceptional correspondence .",
    "for example , the @xmath203 structure in fig .",
    "17b between 6 and 11 kpc and the same allowed mode by swing amplification at exactly the same radii .",
    "even nicer is the correspondence between fig .",
    "17c and fig .",
    "19 bottom panel . in that case",
    "the radial functionality of the appearing structure and the predicted amplifications are in striking agreement .    to investigate if the magnitude of the disturbances is consistent with swing amplification theory , for the case of fig .",
    "14c the initial gas distortions have been compared with the eventual strength of the stellar mass arms .",
    "for example at @xmath231 = 3 kpc gas mass fluctuations are @xmath66 3.5 2  and the @xmath0 stellar mass arms have a strength of @xmath66 23.6 2  implying an amplification of a factor @xmath66 6.7 .",
    "the allowed maximum amplification of @xmath0 at @xmath231 = 3 kpc is @xmath66 11 , in perfect agreement with the simulations . likewise , at @xmath231 = 5 kpc for @xmath203 one has an amplification of @xmath66 4.7 while a maximum of @xmath66 17 is allowed , and at @xmath231 = 13 kpc amplifications are @xmath66 2.2 while @xmath66 4.5 is allowed .",
    "one may conclude that the predictions of swing amplification theory and the results of the numerical simulations are completely consistent .",
    "not only for the radial positions where the modes preferentially occur , but also for the actual strength of the spiral arms .",
    "for a late type bar stable galaxy in isolation it does not seem possible to have a grand design spiral density wave pervading its disc . the spiral structure which does develop",
    "is on a medium and small scale with a multiplicity increasing as a function of radius . that finding can be explained qualitatively and quantitatively by swing amplification ; a process which occurs naturally in a differentially rotating disc .",
    "if swing amplification can explain the structure for a late type galaxy so well , it is likely that it also applies for other , more earlier types .",
    "the question which then emerges is whether for some galaxy swing amplification allows a spiral structure with a constant multiplicity over a sizable range of radii .",
    "such a situation would , in principle , be equal to a grand design .    to answer the question one could calculate the amplification factors for a number of observed galaxies and investigate if a certain mode is dominant over a large radial extent .",
    "such a calculation has been done by athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1987 ) but unfortunately they do not present the radial modal functionality . a global insight can be obtained by considering equations 29 and 30 and fig .",
    "18 . to make a constant radial multiplicity",
    ", the @xmath216 parameter can only be slightly variable and the @xmath217 parameter needs to be nearly constant . for ngc 628 ( fig .",
    "18 ) that is certainly not the case . making a constant @xmath217",
    "requires that @xmath232 is constant , while in the mean time the rotation curve should be rather flat .",
    "that results in the condition that @xmath233 constant which is impossible to achieve for an exponential disc @xmath234 .",
    "it can , however , not be excluded that for some rotation curve and photometry a constant @xmath217 over an extent of , say , two scalelengths can be achieved .",
    "for a number of well known grand design galaxies the @xmath0 mode is the dominant one .",
    "how can such a situation arise when swing amplification is the driving mechanism ? for a late type galaxy ( like ngc 628 ) figures 18 and 19 can again give some insight . in case of a maximum disc rotation of 126 ( and @xmath77 = 675 pc )",
    "the amplifications are given in the top panel of fig .",
    "19 . for radii between 3 to 10",
    "kpc the @xmath209 mode is the largest .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "( 30 ) shows that exactly the same @xmath217 values are achieved when half the multiplicity @xmath235 is used and a double value of the surface density",
    ". then fig .",
    "19 ( top ) has also the same appearance but the @xmath209 is replaced with @xmath0 , while the amplifications are much larger because @xmath1 is smaller .",
    "as a consequence @xmath0 is dominant between 3 and 10 kpc and might drive a grand design @xmath0 through the rest of the galaxy .",
    "the problem is , however , that the surface density has to be doubled , which makes the disc massive , with a maximum rotation of @xmath66 180 and then a bar emerges .",
    "so , as soon as a late type galaxy reaches the state that @xmath0 is active over a considerable radial extent and with enough amplitude , its disc is so massive that instead a bar develops .",
    "this explains the results of the numerical calculations in this paper , namely that only multiple , non grand design spirals appear , or a bar when the disc is more massive .",
    "unless , of course , one explicitly prevents the development of a bar ( elmegreen & thomasson 1993 ) . then a grand design @xmath0 may exist in a hypothetical galaxy .    for late type galaxies",
    "it seems impossible to create a grand design and for other disc like galaxies it seems to be very difficult .",
    "how does nature then make the well known beautiful spiral galaxies which adorn so many front pages of astronomy books ?",
    "what can at first be noticed is that these beautiful galaxies all belong to a very small and select group ; there are simply not many of such galaxies .",
    "what can further be noticed is that these galaxies generally have companions .",
    "kormendy & norman ( 1979 ) already remarked that : `` in general a galaxy shows a global spiral pattern .... by having a density wave driving mechanism in the form of a bar or a companion '' .",
    "for example , well known grand designs with clear signs of interaction are : m81 , m51 , m101 , ngc 7753 , ngc 5364 , and ngc 4305 .",
    "an interaction with accompanying tidal forcing gives , in principle , a natural explanation for an emanating @xmath0 symmetry . in addition",
    "both theoretical and numerical calculations ( toomre 1981 ) show that even a modest external forcing may produce a transient grand design spiral pattern .",
    "such a pattern when viewed from the right angle looks very similar to the observed morphological and kinematical structure of , for example , m81 ( visser 1980 ) .",
    "considering these arguments and the present numerical simulations of isolated galaxies , i then conclude that nearly all non barred grand design spirals are created by an interaction .    but how about ngc 628 ? that galaxy is supposed to be the template for a typical late type galaxy , yet its observed spiral structure is more of a grand design nature than can be generated in the simulations .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be resolved by looking at the neutral hydrogen observations of ngc 628 ( kamphuis & briggs 1992 ) which show that ngc 628 is not that isolated after all .",
    "instead two gas clouds with masses of @xmath66 10@xmath49  are situated on opposite sides of the centre at a radius of @xmath66 12 .",
    "in fact the image of these clouds in fig .",
    "3 of kamphuis & briggs is similar to the gravitational forcing displayed in fig . 1 of toomre ( 1981 ) . that modest forcing already generates a huge transient spiral wave in the underlying galactic disc .",
    "although the exact forcing of the gas clouds in ngc 628 is not known , these clouds can certainly explain the grand design structure of ngc 628 by swing amplification .      when the stellar velocity dispersion of a disc is measured the possibilities for a galaxy s internal constitution are severely restrained . for a locally isothermal disc one has the relation @xmath236 bottema ( 1993 ) .",
    "this equation can be rewritten to @xmath237 and can be drawn onto fig .",
    "11 once the scalelength and dispersion ( @xmath83 ) are measured .",
    "for example , lets take ngc 628 being clearly not barred , which restricts the galaxy to lie in the stable section of fig .",
    "11 . unfortunately the stellar velocity dispersion is not measured , but can be inferred from fig . 3 of bottema ( 1993 ) such that @xmath238 . for a scalelength of 4.5 kpc , eq .",
    "( 33 ) when related to fig .",
    "11 implies that @xmath239 150 , even though the thickness of the disc is not known . a more massive disc would bring the galaxy into the bar unstable region , obviously not consistent with its appearance .",
    "a different approach to determine the contribution of the disc has been employed by athanassoula et al .",
    "they use swing amplification theory to investigate the presence of the amplifier for a certain mode in case of different disc contributions . for a sample of 48 galaxies with reasonably accurate rotation curves",
    "this investigation has been performed .",
    "it appears that , in order to avoid @xmath201 , for the majority of the sample implies that the disc is less massive than the so called `` maximum disc situation , having a halo without a hollow core '' . in practice that means",
    "the threshold for allowing @xmath0 is for the majority of the sample at an @xmath241 ratio approximately half of that to avoid @xmath201 ( not surprisingly ) . in terms of rotational values",
    "one then has no @xmath0 amplification any more for @xmath242 .",
    "that are the facts presented by athanassoula et al .",
    "a problem is , however , that it is unclear what is meant with `` requiring that the amplifier is active '' .",
    "is a minimum amplification required ? and over what radial extent is it required to be active ?",
    "for instance can fig .",
    "19 be regarded as presenting an active @xmath0 mode ?    a second problem is associated with the interpretation .",
    "for example the requirement of no @xmath201 is in contradiction with the results of the fourier analysis of considre & athanassoula ( 1988 ) , which shows that for a large fraction of galaxies @xmath201 is present and even dominant . on the other hand",
    "it is not known which fraction of real galaxies indeed has @xmath0 dominant over a certain radial extent .",
    "certainly there are a number of galaxies which do not have @xmath0 present ; which are flocculent or amorphous , which implies that @xmath243 for that category . by using the swing amplification theory",
    "it is assumed that galaxies are not interacting , such that all @xmath0 activity has an internal origin .",
    "that is certainly not valid and a number of galaxies could be featureless when they would be isolated .",
    "considering the facts presented by athanassoula et al .",
    "and the discussion just presented , in my opinion , the observed range of morphologies of galaxies is certainly consistent with the average ( non barred ) galaxy having @xmath244 .      in eq .",
    "( 25 ) a dimensionless bar stability criterion is given for a galaxy comparable to ngc 628 .",
    "the criterion depends on two parameters : @xmath161 and the aspect ratio @xmath245 . here",
    "i shall elaborate on other parameters that may be of influence for a more general galaxy , but shall not go into details on bar formation ( see e.g. lynden - bell 1979 ; toomre 1981 ; binney & tremaine 1987 , p 381 ) .",
    "earlier type galaxies have more prominent bulges . adding a bulge to a disc plus halo situation has two effects .",
    "firstly , the rotation curve is made flatter in the inner regions , creating and ilr .",
    "such an ilr may frustrate or inhibit the formation of a bar . secondly adding a bulge means that the disc is dynamically less important and the bulge may be considered as a kind of substitute halo . the combination of both effects results in a galaxy being more stable against bar formation if its bulge is more massive .",
    "an extreme example of this is presented by sellwood & evans ( 2001 ) where they replace in the inner regions nearly the complete dark halo by a bulge .",
    "the maximum disc rotational contribution is then 75% and the minimum @xmath1 value amounts to 1.75 .",
    "that galaxy is stable , which is not surprising when one considers the rotational contributions and @xmath1 values presented in sect .",
    "the bar forms just as well with or without the amount of gas typical for an sc galaxy .",
    "this is contrary to the claim by shlosman & noguchi ( 1993 ) that a considerable gas content may inhibit the formation of a bar .",
    "their calculations , however , do not include star formation and consequently no sf feedback . as a result",
    "a few `` superclouds '' develop which rapidly spiral inwards by dynamical friction and strongly heat up the stellar content in the inner regions .",
    "the galaxy is then too hot to form a bar .",
    "in reality star formation sets in and under normal conditions such massive gas clouds will never form .",
    "different bar stability criteria have been derived before . at first , for example , the @xmath246 criterion by ostriker & peebles ( 1973 ) .",
    "that criterion is derived for maclaurin spheroids and is as such only applicable for that kind of theoretical galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath24 and @xmath247 are not easily related to observable quantities .",
    "what the calculations of ostriker & peebles did make very clear was that a large spherical ( dark ) matter contribution is an effective way to stabilize against bars .    a second bar stability criterion put forward by a.o .",
    "sellwood & carlberg ( 1984 ) is the requirement of a specified minimum @xmath1 value .",
    "the problem is to actually determine that @xmath1 value . as demonstrated in sect .",
    "6 , @xmath1 is not unique , certainly not when gas is present in a disc .",
    "moreover @xmath1 has a radial functionality which will be different when the radial mass profile is different .",
    "one then has to consider the minimum @xmath1 value , or require @xmath1 to be below a certain value over a certain radial extent .",
    "even then a small difference in @xmath1 can mark the change over from stable to unstable .",
    "what can be determined from the investigations in this paper is that stability problems arise as soon as @xmath1 ( @xmath147 or @xmath149 ) at some radius falls below the value of @xmath248 .",
    "it may , however , also be 1.1 or 1.3 if the constitution of the galaxy is slightly different .",
    "a third criterion is the one by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1982 ) stating that a disc is stable to bar formation if @xmath249 this criterion can be rewritten considering that for an exponential disc @xmath250 such that eq .",
    "( 34 ) translates into @xmath251 in order to be stable .",
    "considering fig .",
    "11 which contains the criterion of the present study , it is clear that efstathiou et al s criterion is overly restrictive .",
    "in addition , for very thin discs with @xmath252 it is not valid , though such thin discs are probably not present in reality",
    ".      it would be desirable to include the effects of dust and metals in the numerical code . then matters like fuv shielding ,",
    "variable cooling functions , and h@xmath44 formation can be investigated .",
    "that might be important in cases like starburst galaxies or ulirgs .",
    "a grand design in a non - barred realistic galaxy still has to be created .",
    "since that does not appear to be possible in an isolated galaxy , encounters have to be simulated .",
    "small satellites passing a large galaxy can be simulated using a dead halo , but for larger satellites dynamical friction becomes important and a life halo must be used .",
    "re - creation of the m51 encounter or the m81-m82 interaction would be a nice challenge .",
    "it appears difficult to compare numerical spiral structure with actual spiral structure in a quantitative way .",
    "this is mainly caused by the lack of observational data on spiral structure .",
    "surely a program to obtain such data is not that difficult .",
    "moreover , asymmetries in galaxies can then be investigated by determination of the amount of @xmath201 and from that the presence and frequency of interactions might be established .        1 .   a disc in star formation equilibrium is established by two opposing actions . on the one hand gas cooling and dissipation , on the other hand gas heating by the fuv field of young stars and mechanical sn feedback .",
    "2 .   too little sn feedback results in a disc with giant sf regions ; too much sn feedback disperses the gas and dilutes the spiral structure .",
    "spiral features are generated in the disc by shearing gas filements which swing amplify the underlying mass distribution .",
    "spiral arms exist for approximately half a rotation period and disappear by winding and stretching or by interaction with other spiral features .",
    "a confirmation is given of ostriker & peebles ( 1973 ) result that a late type spiral galaxy is more unstable to bar formation when its disc contribution to the total mass is larger .",
    "a late type spiral galaxy is more unstable to bar formation when its thickness or equivalently its stellar velocity dispersion is lower .",
    "a bar stability criterion is determined for late type galaxies , depending on the ratio of maximum disc rotation to total rotation and on disc thickness .",
    "the bar stability of a disc barely depends on the amount of gas .",
    "9 .   at the maximum disc limit a bar stable galaxy can only be created for a disc which is unrealistically thick .",
    "the simulations display the presence of a substantial ( 20  25% ) amount of luke warm gas in the temperature range from 1000 to 8000 k. 11 . in the stellar disc",
    "the simulated velocity dispersion of the gas is in good agreement with the observations .",
    "the increase of the stellar velocity dispersion ( stellar heating ) of newly formed stars proceeds proportional to @xmath180 , as observed in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "after @xmath66 6.5 gyrs the velocity dispersion level of the old stellar population is reached .",
    "the simulations generate small and medium scale spiral structure of which the multiplicity increases as a function of radius .",
    "it is not possible to create a grand design @xmath0 spiral . unless a bar develops which may drive the @xmath0 structure .",
    "when compared with some exemplary spiral galaxies , the numerically generated spiral structure is less strong and has a larger multiplicity .",
    "the emerging spiral structure is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the theory of swing amplification .",
    "swing amplification explains that for a late type galaxy a dominant @xmath0 mode over a considerable radial extent can only exist in a massive disc .",
    "such a disc is unstable to bar formation . as a consequence",
    "a grand design @xmath0 spiral can not develop in an isolated bar stable late type galaxy , just as predicted by the numerical simulations .",
    "the suggestion of kormendy & norman ( 1979 ) is confirmed that most of the grand design @xmath0 spirals must be generated by an interaction or are driven by a central bar .",
    ". the observed range of morphologies of galaxies is consistent with the average ( non barred ) galaxy having @xmath244 .",
