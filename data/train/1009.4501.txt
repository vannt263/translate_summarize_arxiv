    "a region is said to be _ cloaked _ if its contents together with the cloak are invisible to certain noninvasive wave detections .",
    "blueprints for making objects invisible to electromagnetic waves were proposed by pendry _",
    "_ @xcite and leonhardt @xcite in 2006 . in the case of electrostatics ,",
    "the same idea was discussed by greenleaf _",
    "@xcite in 2003 .",
    "the key ingredient for those constructions is that optical parameters have transformation properties and could be _ push - forwarded _ to form new material parameters .",
    "the obtained materials / media are called _ transformation media _ , which we shall further examine in the current work for cloaking of the full system of maxwell s equations .",
    "the transformation - optics - approach - based scheme proposed in @xcite is rather singular .",
    "this poses much challenge to both theoretical analysis and practical fabrication .",
    "in order to avoid the singular structures , several regularized approximate cloaking schemes are proposed in @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite and @xcite are based on truncation , whereas in @xcite , the ` blow - up - a - point ' transformation in @xcite is regularized to be the ` blow - up - a - small - ball ' transformation .",
    "the performances of both regularization schemes have been assessed for cloaking of acoustic waves to give successful near - invisibility effects .",
    "particularly , in @xcite , the authors show that in order to ` nearly - cloak ' an _ arbitrary _ content , it is necessary to employ an absorbing ( ` lossy ' ) layer lining right outside the cloaked region .",
    "since otherwise , there exist cloaking - busting inclusions which defy any attempts of cloaking .",
    "this idea of introducing a lossy layer has recently been intensively investigated for approximate acoustic cloaking ( see @xcite ) , whose behaviors are now much well understood . however",
    ", very little progress has been made in the study of approximate em cloaking for full maxwell s equations due to the more complicated structure of maxwell s equations .",
    "this is the main concern of the present article .",
    "we have considered both the ` truncation - scheme ' and the ` blow - up - a - small - ball - scheme ' for approximate em cloaking . however , in our study , the two regularization schemes have the same performances for near - invisibility , so we focus our exposition on the latter one . based on a model problem ,",
    "the following aspects on the approximate em cloaking are addressed in detail .",
    "( i )  the near - cloak of em waves for both passive media and active / radiating sources . for approximate cloaking of passive media ,",
    "the near - cloak is shown to be within @xmath0 of the singular ideal cloaking , where @xmath1 is the regularization parameter .",
    "whereas if there is a delta point source present in the cloaked region , the near - cloak is shown to be within @xmath2 of the perfect cloaking .",
    "that is , we could still achieve the near - invisibility effect , but with one order reduction on the approximation .",
    "compared to the near - invisibility assessments in @xcite for approximate acoustic cloaking ( which is of @xmath3 when spatial dimension is 3 ; and @xmath4 when spatial dimension is 2 ) , the performances for near - cloak of em waves are much better .",
    "we point out that the study in @xcite lacks the analysis on the approximate cloaking when there is an active / radiating source present inside the cloaked region .",
    "another rather interesting observation we would like to make is that in @xcite , it is shown one can not perfectly cloak an @xmath5-source inside the cloaked region since otherwise there would be a conflict with certain ` hidden ' boundary conditions of the finite energy solutions underlying the singular ideal em cloaking , but our analysis here shows that one could nearly - cloak a delta point source inside the cloaked region .",
    "( ii )  if one allows that the contents in the cloaked region could be _ arbitrary _ , then for a fixed near - cloak construction , there always exist cloaking - busting inclusions which defy any attempts of cloaking .",
    "these are similar to the resonant inclusions observed in @xcite for approximate acoustic cloaking .",
    "following @xcite , we employ a lossy layer with conducting medium outside the cloaked region to overcome the resonance and re - achieve all the approximate cloaking results for passive media and active sources in ( i ) .",
    "( iii )  the performance of the approximate em cloaking in asymptotically low and high frequency regimes .",
    "we show that it is impossible , with a fixed near - cloaking scheme , to obtain cloaking uniformly in frequency , especially for the cloaking of active / radiating objects .",
    "our observation is closely related to the very recent study in @xcite , where frequency dependence for the approximate acoustic cloaking is considered .",
    "( iv )  the limiting behaviors of solutions to regularized approximate cloaking problems , and their connections to finite energy solutions considered in @xcite for singular ideal cloaking problems .",
    "our study has been mainly restricted to spherical cloaking devices with uniform cloaked contents .",
    "we base our analysis on spherical wave functions expansions of em wave fields .",
    "nonetheless , we believe similar results would equally hold for general approximate em cloaking study .    in this paper",
    ", we focus entirely on transformation - optics - approach in constructing cloaking devices .",
    "we refer to @xcite for state - of - the - art surveys on the rapidly growing literature and many striking applications of transformation optics .",
    "but we would also like to mention in passing the other promising cloaking schemes including the one based on anomalous localized resonance @xcite , and another one based on special ( object - dependent ) coatings @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the basics on transformation optics in a rather general setting and apply them to the construction of em cloaking devices .",
    "sections 35 are devoted to the main results , respectively on , cloaking of passive media , cloaking of radiating objects and , cloaking - busting inclusions and retaining of cloaking by employing a lossy layer .",
