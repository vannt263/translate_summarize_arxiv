    "ultracold atomic gases have been considered as ideal platforms for the quantum simulation of interesting models in a variety of different physical contexts , ranging from condensed matter physics , to nuclear physics @xcite . with powerful tools like feshbach resonance , optical lattice etc .",
    ", strongly correlated models can be studied in this novel type of experimental systems .",
    "of particular importance is the possibility to simulate models that have no counterparts in other systems . in the past decade or so ,",
    "interesting phenomena like bcs - bec crossover , superfluid to mott insulator transition in a bose - hubbard model etc .",
    ", which do not occur naturally in condensed matter systems , have been investigated experimentally using ultracold atom gases @xcite .    recently , by engineering the atom - laser coupling , synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has been realized experimentally in ultracold atoms @xcite . as soc is considered to play a key role in systems with interesting properties like quantum spin hall effect or topological phases @xcite , the experimental realization of soc in ultracold atoms",
    "has greatly extended the possibility of quantum simulation in these systems .",
    "a considerable amount of theoretical and experimental efforts have since been dedicated to the characterization of rich physics in spin - orbit coupled atomic gases @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have focused on the rashba or dresselhaus soc , which also exist in solid state systems ; or on the nist soc , which can be readily implemented with present technology @xcite .",
    "more exotic forms of soc , such as a three - dimensional ( 3d ) soc , which have not been observed in natural condensed matter systems , have also attracted some attention recently in bosonic systems @xcite . with the recent proposals of implementing 3d soc in ultracold atomic gases @xcite , it is hopeful that interesting physics like 3d topological insulators @xcite , weyl semi - metals @xcite , or pairing physics in a fermi gas etc .",
    "@xcite , could be investigated in these systems .",
    "indeed , a particularly interesting problem that has been under intensive theoretical study lately is the pairing superfluidity in an attractively interacting fermi gas with soc and effective zeeman fields . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi gas with rashba soc and axial zeeman field",
    ", it has been shown that a topological superfluid state can be stabilized , which supports topologically protected edge states and majorana zero modes at the core of vortex excitations @xcite .",
    "while for a 2d fermi gas with the experimentally available nist soc or for a 3d fermi gas with rashba soc , nodal superfluid states with gapless excitations exist @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that for a 2d fermi gas under nist soc and cross zeeman fields , finite center - of - mass momentum fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states become the ground state of the system @xcite .",
    "these fflo states are different from the conventional fflo pairing states in a polarized fermi gas in that they are driven by soc - induced spin mixing and transverse - field - induced fermi surface deformation @xcite .",
    "a natural question that follows is whether such an exotic pairing state is a unique feature of systems with soc and fermi surface asymmetry .    in this work ,",
    "we study the pairing states in a 3d attractively interacting fermi gas with 3d soc and an effective axial zeeman field @xcite . as previous studies with 3d soc",
    "have mostly focused on bosonic systems , our work provides a starting point for the understanding of the effects of 3d soc in a fermionic system .",
    "additionally , the fermi surfaces of such a system are asymmetric along the direction of the effective zeeman field .",
    "hence it is an ideal system for the study of pairing states under soc and fermi surface asymmetry . to get a qualitative understanding of the pairing physics , we focus on the zero - temperature phase diagram on the mean - field level .    for the zero center - of - mass momentum pairing states",
    ", we find that exotic nodal superfluid states exist with either two or four closed gapless surfaces in momentum space . as the anisotropy of the 3d soc along the axial direction increases ,",
    "these gapless surfaces shrink gradually , and will eventually collapse into gapless points as the 3d soc is reduced to a rashba form .",
    "therefore , these nodal superfluid states can be seen as the counterparts of the nodal superfluid states in a 3d fermi gas with rashba soc and an effective zeeman field @xcite .",
    "we also find that the interplay between soc , effective zeeman field and pairing in the system can lead to first - order phase boundaries between different superfluid states , which implies the existence of a phase separated state in a uniform gas and spatial phase separation in a trapped gas .",
    "these findings provide a valuable starting point for understanding finite center - of - mass momentum pairing states .    when the finite center - of - mass momentum pairing is taken into account ,",
    "the phase diagram is qualitatively modified .",
    "similar to the effects of a transverse field in the nist scheme , the effective axial zeeman field in combination with the 3d soc makes the fermi surface asymmetric . as a result ,",
    "pairing states with zero center - of - mass momentum become unstable against fflo states , with the center - of - mass momentum of the pairs determined by the fermi surface asymmetry @xcite .",
    "these fflo states are characteristic of pairing states in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and fermi surface deformation , which induce a shift of the local minima in the thermodynamic potential landscape onto the plane of finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "consequently , these fflo states retain many features of their zero center - of - mass momentum counterparts , e.g. the existence of first - order boundaries between different fflo states , the stabilization of nodal fflo states with gapless surfaces in momentum space , and the presence of a continuous transition between the gapless and a fully gapped fflo state . as similar scenarios",
    "have also been reported in fermi gases with nist soc in different dimensions @xcite , we expect that these should be the unique features for pairing states under soc and fermi surface asymmetry , and should be independent of the concrete form of soc .",
    "we stress that the fflo state considered in this work is in fact the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state , i.e. , pairing state with a single center - of - mass momentum @xmath0 .",
    "more generally , one should also consider the larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state , where the center - of - mass momentum of the pairing state has both @xmath0 and @xmath1 components .",
    "the stability of the lo state in a spin - orbit coupled system is a subtle issue and can be investigated for example , by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "i , we present our mean - field formalism ; in sec ii , we first discuss the phase diagram when only zero center - of - mass momentum pairing states are considered ; we take finite center - of - mass pairing states into account in sec .",
    "iii , where we also discuss the general physical picture of pairing under soc and fermi surface asymmetry . finally , we summarize in sec .",
    "we consider a 3d uniform two component fermi gas with an axially symmetric 3d spin - orbit coupling @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are the pauli matrices , and the parameter @xmath5 depicts the anisotropy of the 3d soc .",
    "the system is further subject to an effective zeeman field along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the quantization volume in 3d , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) represent the annihilation ( creation ) operators for atoms of different spin species , @xmath15 is the chemical potential , @xmath16 is the effective zeeman field , @xmath17 is the spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "we have assumed @xmath18-wave contact interaction between atoms of different spin species , where the bare interaction rate @xmath19 should be renormalized following the standard relation @xcite @xmath20 the physical interaction rate @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the s - wave scattering length between the two spin species , which can be tuned via the feshbach resonance technique .",
    "we note that while the soc becomes isotropic when the anisotropy parameter @xmath24 , it reduces to the rashba type soc for @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ heqn ] ) can be diagonalized under the mean - field approximation , for which we define the ff pairing order parameter @xcite : @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian can be arranged into a matrix form under the basis @xmath27 @xmath28 here , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the identity matrix .",
    "diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian ( [ hmatrix ] ) , we may then evaluate the zero - temperature thermodynamic potential @xmath31 here , the quasi - particle ( hole ) dispersion @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ hmatrix ] ) . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 to be real throughout the work .    typically , the ground state of the system can be found by solving the gap equation @xmath38 and the number equation @xmath39 simultaneously , where @xmath40 is the total particle number density . however , the competition between pairing and the effective zeeman field leads to a double - well structure in the thermodynamic potential for both the @xmath41 and the finite @xmath0 cases .",
    "therefore , to get the correct ground state of a uniform gas , one must explicitly take into account of the possibility of phase separation between the phases that correspond to the degenerate local minima of the thermodynamic potential @xcite .",
    "indeed , for calculations in a canonical ensemble where the total particle number is fixed , a phase - separated state must be taken into consideration when minimizing the helmholtz free energy . as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , this is reflected in the fact that for certain total number densities , the number equation and the gap equation can not be solved simultaneously , unless a phase separated state is considered .",
    "on the other hand , for a fixed chemical potential , one does not need to solve the number equation , hence there is no phase separation . in this work ,",
    "we fix the chemical potential @xmath15 and look for the global minimum of the thermodynamic potential ( [ thermoeqn ] ) as a function of the pairing order parameter @xmath42 and center - of - mass momentum @xmath0 .",
    "considering the fact that different spin states are mixed in the presence of soc , the phase diagram obtained from this algorithm can be easily connected to that of a uniform system with a fixed total particle number . besides , the global minimum of the thermodynamic potential for a fixed chemical potential also corresponds to the local ground state in a trapped gas under the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the total particle number in the trap can then be evaluated by integrating the local number densities from the trap center to its edge , i.e. by integrating the number equation with decreasing chemical potentials .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to reveal the phase structure in slow - varying potential traps from the resulting phase diagram under lda .",

    "we then map out typical phase diagrams on the @xmath15@xmath17 plane for pairing states with finite center - of - mass momentum ( see fig .",
    "[ figfflophase ] ) . on the phase diagrams ,",
    "all the zero center - of - mass momentum pairing states are replaced by fflo states with center - of - mass momentum opposite to the direction of the axial zeeman field ( @xmath99 ) , as we have expected from previous analysis .",
    "note that for appropriate parameters , pairing states with center - of - mass momentum perpendicular to the zeeman field are also stable against pairing states with @xmath41 , but are metastable against the ground state on the phase diagram . as we have discussed before ,",
    "a qualitative understanding here is that the local minima of the thermodynamic potential in the @xmath41 case are shifted onto the finite @xmath0 plane . when this shift in phase space is not too large , many properties of the resulting fflo states are similar to those of the original zero center - of - mass momentum pairing states . for instance , we still have first - order phase boundaries between different fflo states ; we still have nodal fflo states with two ( nfflo1 ) or four ( nfflo2 ) gapless surfaces in momentum space ( see fig .",
    "[ figfflocontour ] ) ; and we have a continuous boundary between the nodal fflo state ( nfflo1 ) and a fully gapped fflo state ( g - fflo ) .",
    "furthermore , there appear to be two disconnected nfflo1 states on the phase diagram , which are separated by a stability region of the nfflo2 state for smaller @xmath17 . across the boundary between nfflo1 and nfflo2 ,",
    "typically , a new pair of gapless points appear on the @xmath44 axis and develop into gapless surfaces , which is similar to the evolution of gapless surfaces across the nsf1 and nsf2 boundary in the @xmath41 case .",
    "on the other hand , for larger soc strength , the nfflo1 states are typically separated by a continuous boundary , along which the gapless surfaces reduce to two gapless points along the @xmath44 axis .",
    "we illustrate the projections of the gapless surfaces in the @xmath43@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) plane for the two different scenarios in fig .",
    "[ figfflocontour ] .",
    "these fflo states , the g - fflo state in particular , are characteristic of pairing states in the presence of soc and fermi surface deformation .",
    "for example , in the weak coupling limit , one can clearly see that the g - fflo state features an soc - induced single - band pairing , which necessarily has finite center - of - mass momentum due to the fermi surface asymmetry . as the fermi surface asymmetry decreases with increasing chemical potential @xmath15 and/or soc strength @xmath17",
    ", we find that the center - of - mass momentum of the g - fflo state decreases in magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ figqzscale](b ) ) .",
    "we expect that similar fflo pairing states should exist in systems with general forms of soc and fermi surface asymmetry .    as the difference in gapless surfaces for different fflo states originate from the quasi - particle(-hole ) dispersion spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ figdispersion ] ) , a straightforward way to identify these different phases experimentally is to measure the quasi - particle dispersion .",
    "this can be achieved for example , via the momentum resolved radio - frequency spectroscopy .",
    "alternatively , as different topology of gapless surfaces in momentum space should give rise to different low energy excitations , the rich phases and phase transitions in the system can be probed by measuring the thermodynamic properties .",
    "finally , we emphasize that due to the existence of first - order phase boundaries on the phase diagram , one must explicitly take phase - separated states into account to get the correct ground state of a uniform gas . as we have discussed previously , in a uniform gas , the total particle density is typically fixed by the number equation .",
    "however , across the first - order phase boundary , the total particle density of the ground state does not change continuously ( see fig . [ fignalpphase](a ) ) .",
    "this suggests that for certain total number densities , the number equation and the gap equation could not be solved simultaneously , unless a phase separated state is considered .",

    ", a phase - separated ( ps ) region can be clearly identified , where the ground state of the system is a phase - separated state either between the normal state and the g - fflo state , or between two different fflo states .",
