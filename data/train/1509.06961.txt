    "in deijfen ( 2003 ) , a model is introduced that describes the random growth of an infected region in @xmath0 by means of spherical outbursts in the infected region .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the work of deijfen ( 2003 ) in two directions .",
    "first , we generalize the asymptotic shape theorem of that paper from bounded outburst radii to unbounded ones satisfying a certain moment condition ; see theorem [ th : aformgen ] .",
    "second , we extend the model to encompass two competing types of infection , and prove a continuum analog of a result of hggstrm and pemantle ( 2000 ) concerning the impossibility of mutual unbounded growth ; see theorem [ th : huvudres ] .    the model in deijfen ( 2003 ) can be viewed as a generalization to continuous space of the well - known richardson model .",
    "the richardson model , first introduced in richardson ( 1973 ) , describes growth on @xmath1 .",
    "sites can be either infected or uninfected : an uninfected site becomes infected at a rate proportional to the number of infected nearest neighbors and once infected it never recovers . in the continuum model , the growth takes place by way of outbursts in the infected region , an outburst at an infected point causing a ball with stochastic radius around the outburst point to be infected . hence , for all @xmath2 ,",
    "the infected region at time @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath3 , is a union of randomly sized euclidean balls .",
    "the dynamics is that , given @xmath3 , the time until the next outburst occurs is exponentially distributed with expected value proportional to @xmath4 and the outburst point is chosen uniformly in @xmath3 .",
    "the main result in deijfen ( 2003 ) is a shape theorem which asserts that , if there is an upper bound for the radii of the outburst balls , then on the scale @xmath5 the set @xmath3 has an asymptotic shape , which due to rotational invariance must be a euclidean ball .",
    "the following result states that the conclusion of the shape theorem in deijfen ( 2003 ) is still valid under the weaker assumption that the radius distribution , denoted by @xmath6 , has a moment generating function . here",
    "@xmath7 is a closed ball with radius @xmath8 centered at @xmath9 .",
    "[ th : aformgen ] fix @xmath10 and consider the @xmath11-dimensional continuum growth model with rate @xmath12 .",
    "assume that    @xmath13    and let @xmath14 be arbitrary but bounded with strictly positive lebesgue measure .",
    "then there is a real number @xmath15 such that , for any @xmath16 , almost surely @xmath17 for all sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
    "* remark 1.1 * the condition ( [ eq : rvillk ] ) is probably not optimal .",
    "it has been suggested by a referee that it should be possible to replace with a @xmath18-moment assumption for @xmath19 .    in hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998 ) a two - type version of the richardson model",
    "is introduced : two particle types  type 1 and type 2  compete for space on @xmath1 , the dynamics being that an empty site becomes occupied by a type @xmath20 particle at a rate that is proportional to the number of nearest type @xmath20 neighbors and an occupied site remains occupied forever . in this paper a similar two - type version of the continuum model is introduced .",
    "a careful description will be given in section 3 but roughly the model is as follows : two different non - reversible entities  which henceforth will be referred to as type 1 and type 2 infection  compete for space on @xmath0 .",
    "the infected region at time @xmath2 can be divided in two disjoint sets @xmath21 and @xmath22 indicating the region occupied by type 1 infection and type 2 infection respectively .",
    "as in the one - type model the growth takes place by way of outbursts which infect the previously uninfected parts of a ball with random radius around the outburst point .",
    "the outbursts are of two types : type 1 outbursts occur in the type 1 infected region and result in outburst balls of type 1 , that is , the infection transmitted by the outburst is of type 1 .",
    "type 2 outbursts occur in the type 2 infected region and causes outburst balls loaded with type 2 infection .",
    "the radii of the outburst balls are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with the same distribution , denoted by @xmath6 , for both outburst types . for @xmath23 , given @xmath24 the time until an outburst occurs in @xmath24 is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath25 and the outburst point is uniformly distributed over @xmath24 .",
    "note that , if @xmath26 and if we do not distinguish between the infection types , this model is equivalent to the one - type model introduced in deijfen ( 2003 ) .",
    "consider the development of the infection in the two - type richardson model .",
    "there are two possible scenarios :    * one of the infection types is at some point surrounded by the other type , implying that only finitely many sites are ever occupied by the surrounded type . *",
    "both infection types keep growing indefinitely .",
    "clearly the first scenario has positive probability , but what about the second one ?",
    "this issue is dealt with in hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998 ) and ( 2000 ) .",
    "the main result in the first paper is that , if @xmath26  that is , if the infection types are equal in power  and @xmath27 , then the event @xmath28both infection types grow indefinitely@xmath29 has positive probability . in the second paper",
    "the case @xmath30 is considered and the main result is that , if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 has probability zero for all but at most countably many values of @xmath33 ( note that , by time - scaling , the assumption that @xmath31 is no restriction ) .",
    "the main result in the present paper is that , for @xmath34 , this holds also in the two - type continuum model .",
    "this strongly suggests that @xmath32 in fact has probability zero for _ all _ choices of @xmath35 .",
    "see hggstrm and pemantle ( 2000 ) for some intuitive reasoning behind this statement .    before formulating the result",
    ", we have to specify what the event `` both infection types grow indefinitely '' will mean in the continuum model . to this end",
    ", let @xmath36 and define @xmath37 so that @xmath32 hence is the event that both infection types reach arbitrarily far away from the origin simultaneously .",
    "if the outburst radius is bounded , the type 1 ( 2 ) infection is clearly prevented from growing any further if it is surrounded by a type 2 ( 1 ) layer whose thickness exceeds the upper bound for the size of an outburst . in this case",
    "the event @xmath32 thus means that none of the infection types is enclosed by the other and so the concept of co - existence is similar to the lattice case . on the other hand , when the outburst radius is not bounded , it is not possible to rule out @xmath32 in finite time , indicating that we are dealing with a more subtle concept of co - existence .",
    "it is not hard to show that the events @xmath38 and @xmath39 both have positive probability for all choices of @xmath40 and @xmath33 ( see proposition [ prop : pgisn ] ) .",
    "the event @xmath37 is more complicated to study .",
    "however , intuitively it is clear that @xmath32 should not occur if @xmath30 : that both infection types reach arbitrarily far away from the origin means that some kind of balance of power reigns between the infection types and if one of them is more powerful than the other there is no reason to believe that such a balance should be possible .",
    "our main result is a step on the way towards a confirmation of this intuition . to formulate it",
    "some notation is needed .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the probability law of the two - type growth process started at time zero from @xmath42 and @xmath43 and with infection rates @xmath40 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "our first result for the two - type model is that , under the assumption that arbitrarily small outbursts are possible , the particular choice of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is irrelevant in deciding whether the event @xmath32 has positive probability or not .    [",
    "prop : startomr ] let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be two pairs of disjoint , bounded subsets of @xmath0 with strictly positive lebesgue measures . furthermore ,",
    "suppose that @xmath6 has unbounded support and satisfies @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath50    * remark 1.2 * the proof of proposition 1.1 can easily be modified to cover the case with bounded support as well , provided the following ( obviously necessary ) condition on @xmath51 : if the radius distribution is bounded by @xmath8 , then neither of @xmath52 or @xmath53 may contain an impenetrable layer of thickness @xmath8 around the other .    in words",
    ", if we can find two sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 such that the event @xmath32 has positive probability when starting from @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then it follows that @xmath32 has positive probability for all other initial sets @xmath54 and @xmath55 as well .",
    "thus we may restrict our attention to the case when the process is started from two balls with radius given by the mean outburst radius , denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "the balls are placed next to each other , one of them centered at the point @xmath57 and the other at the origin .",
    "the notation for the probability law in this case is simplified by dropping the subscripts so that @xmath58 hence denotes the law of the growth process started from @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , note that by time scaling we may assume that @xmath31 .",
    "the main result is as follows .",
    "[ th : huvudres ] if @xmath6 satisfies ( [ eq : rvillk ] ) , then , for @xmath34 , the set @xmath61 is countable .",
    "thus @xmath62 for all but at most countably many values of @xmath33 .",
    "as mentioned before , this strongly suggests that @xmath62 for all @xmath35 . in the case",
    "@xmath63 on the other hand , it seems reasonable to suspect that @xmath32 has positive probability .",
    "that @xmath63 means that the two infection types are equal in power and hence it should be possible for some kind of balance of power to arise .",
    "let us summarize all this in the following conjecture .",
    "if ( [ eq : rvillk ] ) holds , we have @xmath64 for @xmath34 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "theorem [ th : aformgen ] is proved in section 2 .",
    "section 3 provides a closer description of the two - type continuum model and section 4 contains a number of auxiliary results needed in the following sections . in section 5 an analogue of the `` key proposition '' in hggstrm and pemantle ( 2000 ) is formulated and proved .",
    "this result will be of vital importance in the proof of theorem [ th : huvudres ] and due to the fact that the asymptotic shape for the continuum model is known to be a euclidean ball , its proof is somewhat more appealing for the intuition compared to the lattice case .",
    "theorem [ th : huvudres ] is proved in section 6 and proposition [ prop : startomr ] in section 7 .",
    "the aim in this section is to prove theorem [ th : aformgen ] .",
    "as described in the introduction , the growth in the one - type process is generated by stochastically sized spherical outbursts in the infected region @xmath3 . given the development of the infection up to time @xmath2 , the time until an outburst occurs somewhere in @xmath3 is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath65 and the location of the outburst is uniformly distributed over @xmath3 . to formally construct the model in @xmath11 dimensions , a @xmath66-dimensional poisson process with rate @xmath12 is used , the extra dimension representing time .",
    "a bounded set @xmath67 with strictly positive lebesgue measure is picked to initiate the growth and also , to the points in the poisson process , i.i.d .",
    "radius variables with distribution @xmath6 are attached .",
    "starting at time zero the growth is then brought about by following the cylinder @xmath68 upwards along the time axis until a point in the poisson process is found .",
    "an outburst then takes place at this point and an infection ball @xmath69 with radius given by the radius variable associated with this particular poisson point is created around the outburst point .",
    "the infected region is now given by @xmath70 .",
    "scanning within the cylinder @xmath71 further upwards along the time axis , a new poisson point is eventually hit and a new infection ball @xmath72 arises around this point . and so on .",
    "for a more thorough description of the construction we refer to deijfen ( 2003 ) .",
    "the main result in deijfen ( 2003 ) is the asymptotic shape result in theorem [ th : aformgen ] under the stronger assumption that the outbursts radii are bounded .",
    "( the result was formulated for @xmath73 only , but the general result follows by a simple time scaling argument . )    let @xmath74 be the time when the entire ball with radius @xmath56 around the point @xmath9 is infected in a unit rate process started from @xmath75 .",
    "the time constant @xmath76 is given by    @xmath77}{n}= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{\\tilde{t}(\\textbf{n})}{n},\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 .",
    "the existence of the limit in ( [ eq : mu ] ) and the fact that it is an almost sure constant is proved in deijfen ( 2003 ) .",
    "the proof does not use the assumption of bounded support for the radius distribution and hence it applies also if this assumption is dropped . in fact , the only part of the proof of the shape theorem in deijfen ( 2003 ) that uses the assumption of bounded support for @xmath6 is the one that establishes that @xmath15 , that is , that the infection does not grow faster than linearly in time . hence a weaker condition that guarantees at most linear growth could replace the bounded support assumption without weakening the conclusion of the theorem .",
    "we will show that existence of the moment generating function of @xmath6 is sufficient for the growth to be at most linear .",
    "more precisely , we will show :    [ prop : mugeq0 ] if @xmath79 for some @xmath80 , then @xmath15 .",
    "in view of the above discussion , theorem [ th : aformgen ] follows once we have proved proposition [ prop : mugeq0 ] .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof of proposition [ prop : mugeq0 ] is a `` larger '' growth process in which the outbursts constitute a spatial branching process .",
    "this process will be referred to as the branching random walk growth process .",
    "we will show that the brw process grows at most linearly in time and , since it can be shown that the original growth process is stochastically dominated by the brw process , the proposition follows from this . the time constant @xmath76 is defined based on a unit rate process and hence we consider only unit rate processes for the remainder of this section .",
    "the brw growth process works in a similar way as the original process , with outbursts that infect a randomly sized shape around the outburst point . in the brw process",
    "though , each outburst point is assigned its own independent poisson process to generate new outbursts in the surrounding outburst shape .",
    "furthermore , for technical reasons we will take the outbursts in the brw process to be cubes rather than spheres .    to formally construct the brw growth process ,",

    "finally , for @xmath88 , let @xmath89 denote the restriction of @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "the process now evolves at time points @xmath92 by aid of cubic outbursts with side length @xmath93 centered at points @xmath94 obtained inductively as follows :    * define @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 and let @xmath98 denote a cube in @xmath99 with side length @xmath100 centered at @xmath101 .",

    "a process with the same distribution as @xmath120 is obtained by starting from @xmath123 and then using @xmath128 to generate new outbursts in regions that previously have been exposed to @xmath83 outbursts .",
    "that is , in intersections between @xmath83 outburst balls we scan within @xmath83 independent poisson processes , always including @xmath125 , upwards along the time axis to find new outburst points .",

    "note that the reproduction of the ancestor at the origin is slightly different from the other individuals reproduction in that @xmath132 , that is , the side length of the infection cube surrounding the ancestor is deterministic .    before proving proposition [ prop : mugeq0 ] we state a theorem by biggins that will play a key role in the proof . to formulate the result ,",
