    "just at the dawn of the theory of multiband superconductors , it was established that near the critical temperature @xmath8 , the coherence lengths , which set the length scales of spatial variation of the pairing amplitudes of the bands , are in fact the same , notwithstanding differences in zero-@xmath9 bcs lengths @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the band index and @xmath12 is the fermi velocity )  @xcite .",
    "this result has been  rediscovered \" in the recent debate on the proper form of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of two - band superconductors  @xcite .",
    "this debate was triggered by extensive studies of multiband mgb@xmath13 which prompted the formulation of two order - parameter gl energy functionals to allow for different length scales @xmath14 associated with the two underlying bands , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the predictions of these models was an intervortex attraction at distances large with respect to the london penetration depth .",
    "the observation of vortex clustering in mgb@xmath13 in very small fields was considered as evidence for asymptotic intervortex attraction  @xcite .",
    "while it is established @xcite that near @xmath8 , where the gl - expansion is justified , any generic superconductor with finite interband coupling is governed by a single superconducting order parameter with one coherence length , it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that this does not have to be true away from @xmath8 .",
    "novel behavior is expected especially in cases with different fermi velocities of the bands and for very weak interband coupling ; this requires to turn to microscopic descriptions of superconductors that are applicable at all temperatures .",
    "interesting calculations of this kind were performed in refs .",
    "@xcite and showed that away from @xmath8 and for a very weak inter - band coupling the length scales @xmath15 and @xmath16 are indeed not equal , in particular for low temperatures and at small magnetic fields",
    ".    however , there are several reasons why in real materials the inter - band coupling is not as weak as was assumed in refs . @xcite .",
    "first , the ever present coulomb repulsion will inevitably give rise to off - diagonal matrix elements in band - representation , eventhough the usual renormalization of the coulomb pseudopotential tends to reduce interband interactions more strongly than intraband interactions  @xcite .",
    "for mgb@xmath13 the latter effect was analyzed and is rather moderate @xcite : the bare interband coulomb interaction is about half of the bare intraband interaction ; renormalizations only reduce this ratio by another factor of 2 , yielding interband coulomb interactions that are approximately @xmath17 of the intraband couplings .",
    "second , the matrix elements of the electron - lattice coupling within and between electronic bands are for the important optical phonon branches a priori of the same order of magnitude . even for mgb@xmath13 , where the observation of a leggett - mode in the raman spectrum @xcite is evidence for comparatively weak interband coupling , a careful analysis of the inter- and intraband interactions reveals that the former is still about @xmath18 of the larger and similar to the smaller of the intraband interactions  @xcite . in other systems , such as the recently discussed iron - based superconductors is even argued that the interband coupling is the dominant source of pairing , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "further support for comparatively large interband coupling comes from an analysis of recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements of the density of states ( dos ) distribution within the vortex lattice at low temperatures in several two - band compounds  @xcite . for a single - band material",
    "one can construct a phenomenological model to relate the measured zero - bias dos distribution @xmath19 to the pairing amplitudes @xmath20 in the lattice unit cell  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is readily extended to a two - band situation , for which @xmath19 depends on both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the fit to the stm data for nbse@xmath13 and for nbse@xmath21s@xmath22 showed that @xmath23 at @xmath24k@xmath25 .",
    "the same procedure has been applied to the novel superconductor cakfe@xmath26as@xmath26 with @xmath27k and the zero - field tunneling spectrum having clearly two - gap features , again with the result @xmath28 at sub - kelvin temperatures and at all fields examined  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical considerations and observations motivated us to re - examine the question of the relative values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in two - band superconductors within a microscopic approach that covers a broad temperature and magnetic field regime .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the stm - data suggests that the emergence of one common length - scale is a much more robust phenomenon than one would expect for moderately coupled multi - band system .",
    "thus , we aim at clarifying the issue of when the coupling between two superconducting bands becomes sufficiently strong to give rise to a common length scale and under what conditions two separate length scales of the band - order parameters emerge .    to this end",
    ", we use a  brute - force \" numerical procedure of solving eilenberger equations for a vortex lattice in the two - band case developed in studies of mgb@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "we consider a weak - coupling model of a two - band superconductor with two fermi surface parts having different fermi velocities and study the spatial variation of the pairing amplitudes @xmath29 of the two bands within the vortex lattice unit cell .",
    "while we analyze this model over a wide range of parameters , we do not focus on a specific application for a particular material .",
    "rather , we intend to clarify general properties of the spatial dependency of @xmath29 .",
    "substantially different values of the fermi velocities notwithstanding , the coherence lengths proportional to the vortex core size defined as @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the distance from the vortex center ) turn out nearly the same for all choices of coupling constants @xmath2 examined ( @xmath32 ) except the case of nearly decoupled condensates @xmath33 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath34 our results agree with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath36 , insensitive to details of coupling @xmath2 , temperature , and field .",
    "given the exponential dependence of the superconducting gap on the coupling constants , comparatively weakly coupled systems with @xmath37 may easily display interesting multiband behavior , such as collective fluctuations of the relative phase of the bands  @xcite .",
    "however , our results show that the system is nevertheless governed by a single order - parameter characterized by a single length scale .",

    "this assumption will not affect any of our results qualitatively and can easily be dropped .",
