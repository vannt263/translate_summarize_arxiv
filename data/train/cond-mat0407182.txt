    "current density filament in a bistable semiconductor structure with s - shaped current - voltage characteristic is a high current density domain embedded in a low current density environment @xcite .",
    "typically filaments appear spontaneously due to spatial instability of the uniform current flow when the average current density corresponds to the falling branch of the current voltage - characteristic @xcite .",
    "a single filament survives after the transient ( the - winner - takes - all principle ) whereas multifilamentary states are unstable @xcite .",
    "a static current filament may undergo further bifurcations related to temporal and spatial instabilities @xcite .",
    "spontaneous onset of the lateral movement is an example of such a bifurcation which has been recently studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "this effect is of significant practical importance because the filament motion delocalizes the joule heating of a semiconductor structure operated in the current filamentation regime , and thus dramatically reduces the probability of thermal failure @xcite .",
    "traveling current density filaments bear deep similarities to other traveling spots in active media @xcite , in particular , to traveling wave segments in feed - back controlled light sensitive belousov - zabotinsky reaction @xcite .",
    "the latest exerimental observations of moving filaments @xcite have been made using a recently developed interferometric mapping technique @xcite .",
    "experiments show that in a device with a stripe - like geometry the filament travels in a soliton - like manner with a constant velocity @xmath0 and reflects from the device boundaries .",
    "both measurements and full - scale numerical simulations of the transport processes suggest that the filament motion is thermally driven and related to the joule self - heating @xcite .",
    "thermally driven self - motion is possible due to the negative effect of temperature on the impact ionization rate @xcite and may occur in a wide class of semiconductor structures whose bistability is caused by impact ionization @xcite .",
    "the temperature acts as an inhibitor which provokes translation instability of a steady filament and causes its self - sustained motion towards a cooler region @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present an analytical investigation of the translation instability which occurs at the onset of thermally driven filament motion . using a recently suggested three - component reaction - diffusion model for current filamentation in presence of the joule self - heating @xcite",
    ", we perform a stability analysis of a static filament .",
    "we show that the translation invariance of a static filament in a large structure breaks in presence of the self - heating .",
    "this occurs with increase of the thermal relaxation time which depends on the heat capacity of the semiconductor structure and the efficiency of the external cooling .",
    "the instability threshold decreases when the effect of temperature on the vertical transport becomes stronger and increases with heat diffusion coefficient .",
    "current filamentation in bistable semiconductors can be described by a two - component activator - inhibitor model which consists of a nonlinear reaction - diffusion equation , accounting for the internal activator dynamics in a bistable semiconductor , and an integro - differential equation , accounting for the applied voltage .",
    "this model , originally developed for bulk semiconductors with so called overheating instability @xcite and layered semiconductor structures @xcite , proved to be efficient for a wide class of bistable semiconductors with various mechanims of bistability ( see ref . and",

    "we refer to refs . for comprehensive general formulation of this model .",
    "to decribe the thermally driven motion of a current density filament , the effect of temperature @xmath1 on the cathode - anode transport and the heat dynamics in the structure should be additionally taken into account .",

    "the master equation ( [ master ] ) is coupled to the heat equation ( [ heat ] ) via the temperature dependence of the local kinetic function @xmath29 .",
    "since the heating suppresses impact ionization , the effect of temperature on the vertical transport is negative and @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "we take @xmath34 .",
    "next , we take into account only one lateral dimension @xmath18 , assuming that due to the stripe geometry of the semiconductor structure ( @xmath35 ) the current density distribution is uniform along the @xmath19 direction ( the lower insert in fig.1 ) .",
    "we also assume that the filament is located far from the edges of the stripe @xmath36 .",
    "current density and temperature profiles in a static filament are shown in the upper panel of fig.2 .",

    "the characteristic size of the hot area is much larger than the filament size ( fig.2 , curve 2 in the upper panel ) .",
    "antisymmetric ( with respect to the center of the filament ) fluctuations of the current density do not change the total current and therefore are not suppressed by the external circuit in the current - controlled regime . by increasing the current denisity on one side and decreasing on another such fluctuation effectively leads to a small shift of a filament , moving one of the filament edges to a cooler region and another to a hotter region . due to the heat inertia of the semiconductor structure",
    "the temperature does not follow the current density instantly .",
    "hence favorable conditions for the impact ionization ( production of the activator @xmath3 in terms of eq.([master ] ) ) appear at the one of the filament edges , whereas at another edge the impact ionization is suppressed .",
    "this leads to further shift of a filament and , for a sufficiently long delay of the temperature response , to a self - sustained filament motion .",
    "experiments @xcite show that in a high quality structure filaments start to move to the left and to the right with equal probability .",
    "this suggests that motion is triggered by nonequilibrium fluctuations of the current density .",

    "these eigenmodes are orthogonal and obey the oscillation theorem which says that @xmath56 has @xmath57 nodes inside the interval @xmath45 $ ] . due to the translation invariance for an infinitely large sample",
    "the spectrum of @xmath54 contains a neutral ( so called goldstone ) mode @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "this mode corresponds to the translation of the filament along the @xmath18 axis . for a solitary filament",
    "@xmath39 has a single maximum .",
    "hence @xmath60 has one node and is identified as @xmath61 @xcite . since @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", the first eigenvalue @xmath64 is positive .",
    "the first eigenmode @xmath65 corresponds to spreading or shrinking of the current filament .    since @xmath66 is symmetric with respect to the center of the filament , the  potential term \" @xmath67 in the operator @xmath54 is also symmetric .",
    "hence @xmath65 and @xmath61 are symmetric and antisymmetric , respectively .",
    "the increase of @xmath65 is prevented by the global constraint ( [ global ] ) which effectively fixes the total current when the external resistance @xmath13 is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath68 the last term in the eq.([global_stab1 ] ) vanishes due to the asymmetry of @xmath61 . hence in this case @xmath69 and @xmath70 are not coupled , and we can take @xmath71 .",
    "physically , it happens because @xmath61 does not change the total current and therefore the voltage @xmath4 also does not change .",
    "thus for the current - controlled regime the dynamics of @xmath61 is the same as in the voltage - controlled regime , and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that for the two - component model filaments have neutral stability with respect to translation when the lateral dimension of the semiconductor structure is large ( @xmath73 ) .",
