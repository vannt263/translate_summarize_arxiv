    "-3 mm    the main property of the current states in wide superconducting films , which distinguishes them from narrow channels , is an inhomogeneous distribution of the current density @xmath0 due to the meissner screening of the current - induced magnetic field . it should be noted that the current state of a wide thin film is qualitatively different from that in a bulk superconductor . whereas the transport current @xmath1 in the latter case flows only within a thin surface layer with the thickness of the order of the london penetration depth @xmath2 ,",
    "the current in a thin film with the thickness @xmath3 is distributed over its width @xmath4 according to the approximate power - like law @xmath5^{-1/2}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath6 is the transversal coordinate with the origin in the middle of the film .",
    "thus , the characteristic length @xmath7 , which is commonly referred to as the penetration depth of the perpendicular magnetic field , has nothing to do with the scale of the current decay , but rather plays the role of a `` cutoff factor '' in the above - mentioned law of the current distribution at the distances @xmath8 from the film edges and thereby determines the magnitude of the edge current density .",
    "the latter was estimated in @xcite as @xmath9 , assuming @xmath4 to be much larger than @xmath10 and the coherence length @xmath11 .",
    "in such an inhomogeneous situation , the resistive transition of a wide film occurs @xcite when @xmath12 reaches the value close to the critical current density @xmath13 in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory . using this estimate ,",
    "the expression @xmath14 for the critical current has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "this equation is widely used in analysis of experimental data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and imposes a linear temperature dependence of the critical current @xmath15 near the critical temperature @xmath16 . a quantitative theory by aslamazov and lempitskiy ( al ) @xcite also predicts the linear dependence @xmath17 but gives its magnitude numerically larger than the above estimate .",
    "this result has been confirmed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the instability of the current state at @xmath18 results in the entry of vortices whose motion leads to the appearance of the electric field , i.e. , to formation of the vortex part of the @xmath1-@xmath19 characteristic ( ivc ) . while the current further increases , the motion and annihilation of the vortices form a peak in the current density at the center of the film . for certain current value @xmath20 ,",
    "the magnitude of this peak reaches @xmath21 , which results in instability of the stationary flow of the vortices @xcite",
    ". further behavior of the film depends on the conditions of the heat removal @xcite and the quality of the films . in experiments",
    "performed decades ago , an abrupt transition to the normal state has been usually observed at @xmath22 , whereas in later researches , in which optimal heat compliance was provided , a step - like structure of the ivc is observed at @xmath23 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates the appearance of phase - slip lines , similar to the phase - slip centers in narrow channels .",
    "since @xmath10 unlimitedly grows at @xmath24 , any film reveals the features of a narrow channel in the immediate vicinity of @xmath25 : at @xmath26 , its critical current is due to the uniform pair - breaking ( narrow channel regime ) thus showing the temperature dependence of the gl pair - breaking current @xmath27 .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the film exhibits a crossover to an inhomogeneous current state , in which vortex nucleation is responsible for the resistive transition ( wide film regime ) . in the experiment @xcite , the linear temperature dependence of @xmath28 predicted in @xcite for wide films",
    "becomes pronounced only at low enough temperatures , when @xmath10 becomes smaller than the film width by the factor of @xmath29 , although the vortex state already occurs at much larger values of @xmath30 .",
    "similar difficulties in the fitting of the ivc measurements with the asymptotical results of the al theory were met in the experiment @xcite , because the condition @xmath31 , used in @xcite , can be fulfilled only in extremely wide films whose width exceeds @xmath10 by several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , there exist a considerable intermediate region of the film widths and temperatures , where the asymptotic results of the al theory can not give a satisfactory description of the experimental data , although the assumptions and initial equations of this theory remain valid in this region .    in order to fill up this gap , we perform in this paper a numerical solution of the al equations within a wide region of the ratio @xmath32",
    ". the results of our computations describe smooth transition between the regimes of a wide film and a narrow channel and demonstrate evolution of the current density distribution with the increase of the transport current in both the meissner and the vortex states .",
    "we notice that within the al theory , the critical currents @xmath28 and @xmath20 , being normalized on the gl critical current @xmath33 , as well as the specifically normalized ivc , are universal functions of the ratio @xmath34 . we calculate the fitting constants in the asymptotic formulas of the al theory and",
