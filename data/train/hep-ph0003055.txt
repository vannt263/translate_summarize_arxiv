    "from the recent neutrino oscillation experiments it becomes affirmative that neutrinos have masses . the present and near future experiments enter into the stage of precision tests for masses and lepton mixing angles .",
    "in this situation the investigation of the @xmath0 violation effects in the lepton sector has become more and more important . by taking account of the possible leptonic @xmath0 violating phases for majorana neutrinos",
    ", we have obtained the constraints on the lepton mixing angles from the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath4)@xcite@xcite , the @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion and the k decay , @xmath7@xcite . in this paper",

    "we also try to determine the magnitude of the @xmath0 violating phases by combining the constraints on the neutrino masses and mixing matrix elements from the recent super kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment @xcite , the solar neutrino experiment @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , the recent chooz reactor experiment @xcite , and the future kamland reactor experiment @xcite with those from the lepton number violating processes such as @xmath4 .",
    "the amplitudes of those three lepton number violating processes are , in the absence of right - handed weak couplings , proportional to the `` averaged '' masses @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the `` averaged '' mass @xmath8 defined from @xmath4",
    "is given @xcite by @xmath11 similarly , the `` averaged '' masses @xmath9 defined from @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion and @xmath10 defined from the lepton number violating k decay , @xmath7 are given @xcite @xcite by    @xmath12    respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 violating effects are included in the `` averaged '' masses @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 defined in eqs.([eq761 ] ) @xmath13 ( [ eq771 ] ) . here",

    "three @xmath0 violating phases , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 appear in @xmath19 for majorana neutrinos @xcite . in this paper",
    "we introduce the graphical representations of the complex masses @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then , using these representations , we derive the constraints on the @xmath0 violating phases which appear in the lepton number violating processes .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the graphical representations of the complex masses and the @xmath0 violating phases . in section 3",
    "we present constraints on the @xmath0 violating phases from @xmath4 .",
    "constraints from @xmath4 and the neutrino oscillation experiments are discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary .",
    "we now rewrite the complex mass @xmath29 by using the phase convention in eq.([eq772 ] ) as @xmath30 here we have defined the complex masses @xmath31 by    [ eq000131 ] @xmath32    we also rewrite the complex mass @xmath33 by using the above @xmath31 as follows : @xmath34 here we have used the unitarity constraint that @xmath35 . furthermore , using @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we obtain    [ eq013102 ] @xmath43    therefore , the @xmath8 , @xmath44 , and @xmath10 defined in eqs.([eq761 ] ) @xmath13 ( [ eq771 ] ) are reexpressed by the absolute values of averaged complex masses as    [ eq013103 ] @xmath45    here the averaged complex masses @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are defined by @xmath49    now let us introduce graphical representations of the complex value of the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in a complex mass plane in order to investigate the magnitude of the @xmath0 violating phases in them .",
    "the @xmath46 is the `` averaged '' complex mass of the masses @xmath31 weighted by three mixing elements @xmath50 with the unitarity constraint @xmath51 . therefore , the position of @xmath46 in a complex mass plane is within the triangle formed by the three mass points @xmath31 if the magnitudes of @xmath52 are unknown , which is shown in fig",
    ". 1(a - i ) .",
    "hereafter we refer this triangle as the complex - mass triangle .",
    "this triangle is different from that defined by fogli et al .",
    "@xcite in the sense that ours incorporates the @xmath0 violating phases and masses .",
    "the three mixing elements @xmath50 indicate the division ratios for the three portions of each side of the triangle which are divided by the parallel lines to the side lines of the triangle passing through the @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "1(a - ii ) ) .",
    "the @xmath0 violating phases @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the rotation angles of @xmath56 and @xmath57 around the origin , respectively .",
    "likewise , the constraints on the positions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are depicted in figs.1(b ) and 1(c ) .",
    "the position of @xmath47 is given as fig .",
    "the position of @xmath48 in a complex mass plane is within the triangle formed by the three mass points @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 which is shown in fig .",
    "among the lepton number violation processes such as @xmath61 , the @xmath1 conversion and the k decay , @xmath62 , the @xmath4 gives us most restrictive constraints on the @xmath0 violating phases .",
    "therefore , hereafter we concentrate on the @xmath4 and derive constraints on the @xmath0 violating phases from the experimental upper bound on @xmath63 ( we denote it @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 ) .",
    "since @xmath66 , the present experimental upper bound on @xmath63 obtained from the @xmath4 forms the circle in the complex plane and this circle must include the point @xmath46 inside of it .",
    "namely , the allowed region for @xmath46 is the intersection of the inside of the circle of radius @xmath67 around the origin and the inside of the complex - mass triangle which was discussed in section 2 .    in the case of @xmath68",
    ", we can obtain the constraints on the @xmath0 violating phases from the allowed region for @xmath46 without using any constraints on the mixing elements @xmath69 as follows . in order to obtain the conditions for the allowed @xmath46 , it is more convenient to survey the forbidden regions for @xmath46 .",
    "it is easily understood from fig 2(a ) that the complex - mass triangle does not overlap with the circle @xmath67 only if the following conditions are satisfied for all @xmath70 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath71 here @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the allowed region for @xmath46 is the area where , at least , one of the inequalities of eq .",
    "( [ eq020301 ] ) is violated .",
    "since we have @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , with @xmath54 and @xmath77 in the interval of @xmath78 , we find that majorana @xmath0 violating phases @xmath24 and @xmath79 , must satisfy the following conditions : @xmath80 the allowed region in the @xmath54 vs @xmath77 plane obtained from eq.([eq110580 ] ) is depicted in fig .",
    "eq.([eq110580 ] ) is also useful in the case where the three neutrino masses are almost degenerate and @xmath81 . in this case ,",
    "eq.([eq110580 ] ) reduces to @xmath82 with @xmath83 and the allowed region fig .",
    "2(b ) to fig .",
    "now , we consider the constraints on @xmath84 from the chooz reactor experiment , the recent super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment , solar neutrino experiments and the future kamland reactor experiment . then , by combining these constraints on @xmath84 with one from @xmath85 we derive the possible constraints on the @xmath0 violating phases by using our graphical representation . in the following discussions we consider three cases for the neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. , case(a ) : two quasi - degenerate neutrino with @xmath86 , case(b ) : two quasi - degenerate neutrino with @xmath87 and case(c ) : three quasi - degenerate neutrino with @xmath88 .      in the case , the oscillation probability for reactor neutrinos in the three - generation model , @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 if @xmath91 the present chooz experiment gives a severe restriction on the mixing angle : @xmath92 in this case , since @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94    on the other hand , the oscillation probability for the atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath95 is @xmath96 the atmospheric @xmath97 deficit in the super kamiokande experiment indicates that @xmath98 namely we obtain @xmath99 from these two constraints , eqs.([eq111 ] ) and ( [ eq222 ] ) , we obtain @xmath100 eq.([eq110604 ] ) imposes the restriction on @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , when combined with the allowed region in the complex mass plane discussed in the section 2 , the position of @xmath46 in our graphical representation is restricted by the chooz and super kamiokande experiments as shown in fig .",
    "3 . we also have the constraints on the mixing angle from the solar neutrino experiments .",
    "they give several separate allowed regions for the position of @xmath46 in our graphical representation as shown in fig .",
    "whether the mixing angle for solar neutrinos is large or small can be determined by the future kamland reactor experiment @xcite .",
    "the future kamland experiment will also lead to the constraint on the @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "since the kamland experiment has the chance to observe a lower order mass difference , @xmath104 we ca nt neglect the term depend on @xmath105 so we rewrite eq.([eq110609 ] ) as follows : @xmath106      \\nonumber \\\\    & = & 1-\\left[\\frac{2s_3 ^ 2c_3 ^ 2}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta m_{12}^2l}{4e}\\right ) }         + 4 s_1 ^ 2c_1 ^ 2c_3 ^ 4\\right ]      \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta m_{12}^2l}{4e}\\right).\\nonumber \\\\    & \\equiv & 1-\\xi^2      \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta m_{12}^2l}{4e}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq020701}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used the following conditions , @xmath107 because of their frequent oscillations . let us combine eq.([eq020701 ] ) with the constraint given in eq.([eq110604 ] ) which is obtained from the chooz and super kamiokande experiments .",
    "then the kamland experiment will give the constraints on @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which will restrict the allowed region for the position of @xmath46 as shown in fig .",
    "4 .    now , with use of our graphical representation , we proceed to discuss the main subject in this paper : if we have non zero value of @xmath108 , how can we determine the magnitude of majorana @xmath0 phases @xmath109 ?",
    "first we discuss the simple case in which @xmath101 is approximately zero and the large mixing angle solution(lma ) , @xmath110 , is adopted for the solar neutrino problem . in this case , we have @xmath111 given the values of latexmath:[$\\langle m_\\nu \\rangle_{ee},m_1,m_2 ,    phase @xmath24 is easily obtained from the graphical representation of eq.([eq110605 ] ) .",
    "it goes from fig.1(a - ii ) that the complex - mass triangle gets degenerate to a straight line @xmath113 for @xmath114 case and that the position of @xmath115 moves along the circle with a radius of @xmath116 from the point @xmath117 for changing @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "the measurement of the @xmath108 restricts @xmath46 on the circle with a radius of @xmath108 from the origin .",
    "therefore , the @xmath24 is determined by the intersection of the above two circles as shown in fig.5 . applying the cosine formula to @xmath118 in fig.5 , we find @xmath119 therefore , we obtain @xmath120 it goes from eq.([eq110616 ] ) with the use of @xmath121 that @xmath122 has the lower and upper limits as @xmath123 , which is shown in fig.6 with the definitions of @xmath124 on the other hand , for the case where @xmath125 and the small mixing angle solution(sma ) is adopted for the solar neutrino problem , i.e. , @xmath126 we can not obtain any information about @xmath24 , since we have @xmath127 for @xmath128 or @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "second we consider the case where @xmath131 and the lma solution , @xmath110 , is adopted for the solar neutrino problem . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath132 the graphical representation of eq.([eq022201 ] ) is shown in fig.7 . in fig.7(a ) we consider the case in which the circle of radius @xmath133 around the point @xmath134 ( which we refer as @xmath135 or @xmath136 ) intersects with the circles of radius @xmath137 around the origin at the points @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "we find that @xmath54 is ranging from the argument of @xmath140 to that of @xmath141 as seen in fig.7(a ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath142 is also derived from eq.([eq022201 ] ) : for fixed @xmath54 , the @xmath142 has two solution @xmath143 and @xmath144 which are determined by the points @xmath145 and @xmath146 as shown in fig.7(b ) . here",
    "the @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the intersections of the circle of radius @xmath147 around the point @xmath148 ( which we refer as @xmath149 ) with the circle of radius @xmath122 around the origin since @xmath150 from eq.([eq022201 ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath142 .",
    "we depict this relation in fig .",
    "the other cases may occur but they can be treated analogously .      in this case",
    ", the chooz experiment and the atmospheric neutrino deficit experiment indicates @xmath151 as is seen in fig .",
    "9 . therefore , we can discuss this case with the same way as the case(a ) only by replacing @xmath152 , @xmath102 , and @xmath24 with @xmath153 , @xmath101 , and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "we assume that all three neutrino masses are almost degenerate , then we have @xmath156 the constraints on the @xmath0 violating phases from this @xmath46 is obtained from the similar discussions as in fig .",
    "7 with only taking @xmath157 in it .",
    "it should be noted that for the case where @xmath158 and @xmath101 is approximately zero , we find @xmath159 which is the same result as one obtained from eq.([eq110616 ] ) with replacing @xmath160 with @xmath161 .",
    "we find from eq.([eq555 ] ) that the following lower limit of @xmath162 is obtained for the large mixing angle solution(lma ) , @xmath163 , of the solar neutrino problem , @xmath164 where the lower limit is realized at @xmath165 .",
    "we have introduced graphical representations of the complex masses , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 whose absolute magnitudes are experimentally observable `` averaged '' masses , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the lepton number violation processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay , the @xmath1 conversion and the k decay , @xmath62 , respectively . by using those graphical representations ,",
    "we have investigated how to determine the magnitude of the @xmath0 violating phases from the analysis of the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "first we have discussed without using any constraint on the mixing elements @xmath50 and obtained the constraints on the majorana @xmath0 violating phases , eqs.([eq110580 ] ) and ( [ eq110590 ] ) if @xmath166 , from which the allowed region in the @xmath167 plane have been derived and shown in fig .",
    "2 . of course",
    ", we have no constraint on the majorana @xmath0 phases if @xmath168 .",
    "still , eq.([eq110590 ] ) is useful if the three neutrino masses are almost degenerate and @xmath169 .",
    "next by using the constraints on the mixing elements @xmath170 obtained from the recent super kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment , the solar neutrino experiment , the recent chooz reactor experiment , and the future kamland reactor experiment , we have further discussed the possible constraints on the majorana @xmath0 violating phases for three cases for the neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. , case(a ) : two quasi - degenerate neutrino with @xmath86 , case(b ) : two quasi - degenerate neutrino with @xmath87 and case(c ) : three quasi - degenerate neutrino with @xmath88 . in the case(a ) , we have obtained the expression of @xmath171 , eq.([eq110616 ] ) , in terms of @xmath172 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for the simple case where @xmath173 with the use of the large mixing angle solution(lma ) for the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the @xmath174 relation is shown in fig .",
    "5 . using @xmath175 , we have found that the @xmath108 has the lower and upper limits as given in eq.([eq110626 ] ) .",
    "we have also obtained the relation between @xmath176 for @xmath131 case which is shown in figs . 7 and 8 .",
    "we can discuss the case(b ) using the same way as the case(a ) by replacing @xmath152 , @xmath102 , and @xmath24 with @xmath153 , @xmath101 , and @xmath154 , respectively . in the case(c ) , we have obtained the expression of @xmath162 given in eq.([eq555 ] ) for the simple case where @xmath158 and @xmath173 with the use of the lma solution for the solar neutrino problem . from this relation",
    "we have found that the lower limit of @xmath162 is given by @xmath177 for the lma solution .",
