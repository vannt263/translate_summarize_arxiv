    "in this paper we show that the simplest assumptions on particle production in the very forward direction , feynman scaling and constant inelasticity , can provide a coherent description of air shower and emulsion data .",
    "all features of our model are approximately shared with qcd - inspired models@xcite of high - energy particle interactions .",
    "the phase space populated by the secondaries in very - high - energy cosmic - ray interactions is , unfortunately , not covered by collider experiments which only view centrally produced particles .",
    "we therefore start the discussion with the simplest ansatz for the dynamics of particle production at large rapidities . in the end",
    ", this guess will turn out to be adequate in describing a wide variety of data .",
    "[ sec : theory ]    in order to describe the underlying high - energy particle production dynamics common to accelerator , air shower and emulsion chamber data , we start with the simplest phenomenological model for the rapidity density distribution of charged pion production which we parametrize as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the rapidity of the produced secondaries .",
    "the feynman variable @xmath2 is given by the ratio of the secondary particle energy @xmath3 to the incident energy @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 power law in ( [ rapdens ] ) describes the decrease in the number of particles produced with large @xmath2 values , the @xmath6 term dictates the shape of the function at low @xmath2 .",
    "simple parton counting rules  @xcite imply that @xmath73 and @xmath8 .",
    "( [ rapdens ] ) reflects the approximate feynman scaling behavior in the fragmentation region ( large @xmath9 ) expected from qcd  @xcite .",
    "our basic assumptions imply that the inelasticity @xmath10 , i.e. the fraction of the collision energy going into the production of secondaries , is independent of energy .",
    "qcd - inspired models predict that @xmath11  @xcite at the energy region of interest .",
    "we have to account for nuclear target effects which can simply be done by allowing increased @xmath12-values to describe the enhanced production of low-@xmath2 particles in nuclear collisions .",
    "also , nuclear effects increase the value of the proton - air inelasticity  @xcite to approximately @xmath13 .",
    "this simple picture is consistent with the little information one can extract from accelerator results on the production of particles in the very forward direction  @xcite . especially in the high - energy collider experiments the phase space relevant to cosmic - ray data is usually obscured by the beam - pipe  @xcite .    with this background",
    "we may investigate air shower and emulsion chamber results .",
    "a qcd - based monte carlo simulation of ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray hadron interactions , which incorporates large @xmath14 jet production , has been used by l.k .  ding et al .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as dkty ) to perform a detailed description of air shower observations .",
    "the rapidity distribution of secondary particles has been derived in this analysis  @xcite , e.g.  for interaction energies of @xmath15  ev ( @xmath16  tev ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapdis ] . also shown in the figure is an adequate description of the resulting distribution using eq .",
    "( [ rapdens ] ) with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , parameters quite consistent with our expectations .",
    "the analysis of reference  @xcite also shows that particle production in the forward direction exhibits approximate feynman scaling , consistent with our simple assumptions .",
    "the main point of this paper is that this model , in its simplest form , describes all the details of emulsion chamber experiments .",
    "this was somewhat surprising to us given the many claims of new dynamics and non - scaling behavior in the literature based on the same information ; see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "interestingly , we can not describe some of the centauro events .",
    "the rapidity distribution of the secondaries in these events pegs them as being anomalous , independently of their well - advertised unusual features such as the absence of neutral secondaries .",
    "before proceeding with the study of emulsion chamber data , we first comment on a crucial aspect of the calculation : the mean inelasticity which is calculated through energy conservation ( using charged secondaries only ) @xmath20 the unphysical singularity of eq .",
    "( [ rapdens ] ) on @xmath21 is removed by the threshold effects in the measurement .",
    "the lowest energy particles in the cascade will not make it to observation level .",
    "we implement this by making the @xmath2-distribution constant below a certain value @xmath22 , so that the mean inelasticity is @xmath23 \\;.    \\label{mean}\\ ] ] the existence of a lower limit on @xmath2 , resulting from inevitable energy - loss in the air cascade before it reaches the detector , is well known  @xcite .",
    "emulsion chambers observe the debris of air showers initiated by cosmic rays one or more nucleonic mean - free - paths ( mfp ) above the detector . from the study of ref .",
    "@xcite one concludes that , because of the strong energy dissipation in the cascade , @xmath22 must be around @xmath24 and @xmath25 for mountain altitude measurements .",
    "we can obtain the same result from a back - of - the - envelope calculation .",
    "take as an example the ursa maior event observed by the brazil - japan collaboration  @xcite .",
    "triangulation of the secondary charged tracks predicts that the first interaction occurred 2 or 3  km above the chamber , which represents approximately 2 mfp . at the first interaction the nucleon with energy @xmath4 releases on average around @xmath26 to particle production and therefore @xmath27 to each pionic component ( @xmath28 ) . after 2 more interactions , a charged pion would have on average @xmath29 so that @xmath30",

    "@xcite and , if used in eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) , leads to @xmath31 , matching the expected value ; see section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "we will investigate experimental data obtained in large emulsion chambers , using rigorous analytical solutions of the diffusion equations for the hadronic cascade induced by one single nucleon in the atmosphere .",
    "the one - dimensional solution @xmath32 enables us to calculate the integral energy spectrum of hadrons  @xcite @xmath33 which gives the number of hadrons with energy above @xmath3 , at the detection level @xmath34 for a cascade initiated by a nucleon with energy @xmath4 at atmospheric depth @xmath35 .",
    "the three - dimensional solution @xmath36 is used to calculate the energy - weighted lateral spread  @xcite @xmath37 which evaluates the number of hadrons with energy times radial length greater than @xmath38 .",

    "we obtain @xmath47  tev , which corresponds in the center of mass system ( c.m.s . ) to @xmath48  tev .",
    "the determined depth of the first interaction ( @xmath49 ) is consistent with the expectation that the event started about 2 mfp above the chamber ( see table  [ tab : emuls ] ) .",
    "there is no data available on the energy - weighted lateral spread for this event .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : centauro1](a ) , nor the energy - weighted lateral spread , fig .",
    "[ fig : centauro1](b ) , are reproduced by the analytical calculation .",
    "we verified that the origin of this discrepancy can not be associated with an increase of the transverse momentum of the secondaries , for which there is some experimental evidence .",
    "guided by qcd - inspired models , we proposed a simple phenomenological model for the production of secondaries , based on approximate scaling in the fragmentation region .",
    "the model parametrization is consistent with the behaviour of air showers at ultra - high energies .",
    "we subsequently applied the model to the description of experimental data obtained in emulsion chambers at different mountain altitudes . both integral spectrum and lateral spread of cosmic - ray superfamilies",
    "are successfully reproduced .",
    "we noticed that centaurovii is well described by the model . from our point of view , it is not really different from any other event resulting from normal strong interactions . actually , it has been pointed out previously  @xcite that this event is not a `` hard '' centauro , in the sense that it possesses a comparable number of hadrons and gamma - rays arriving at the top of the upper detection chamber . on the other hand",
    ", the investigation demonstrates that an event like centauroi can not be described with the same simple hypotheses , suggesting that this event is clearly anomalous , even before one considers their charge - to - neutral ratio .",
