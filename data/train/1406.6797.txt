    "one of the most striking impacts of a contact with a superconductor ( s ) onto a small piece of normal metal ( n ) is the modification of the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "this effect , known as the superconducting proximity effect , is related to the induction of superconducting correlations resulting in a finite value of the pair amplitude @xmath4 on the normal side @xcite . in the absence of phonon",
    "mediated attraction between electrons on the normal side , decoherence between electronlike and holelike amplitudes leads to an exponential decay of the pair amplitude with distance from the contact , with a characteristic length scale exceeding the superconducting coherence length .",
    "modification of the ldos on both sides of the contact strongly depends on the scattering properties of the contacts ( described in terms of transmission eigenvalues ) and the properties of the normal region ( geometry , size , and impurity concentration ) . in the case of diffusive systems , it was predicted theoretically that the ldos can even be fully suppressed in a specific energy range around the fermi energy which is known as the minigap @xcite .",
    "the minigap width is of the order of the inverse dwell time in the normal structure , which is given by the thouless energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the mean level spacing of the normal region and @xmath7 is the total conductance of the structure which is assumed large compared to the conductance quantum @xmath8 . in the decades after its discovery",
    "it has in detail been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "the development of more elaborate experimental techniques with high spatial resolution made variations of the ldos in this energy range accessible to experiments @xcite , which was found to be in agreement with theoretical calculations to a high degree @xcite .",
    "much interest was concentrated on systems built up of a finite normal region sandwiched between two superconductors : a josephson junction @xcite . in such systems , another parameter ,",
    "i.e. , the phase difference between the superconducting order parameters comes into play and leads to a phase - dependent minigap @xcite .",
    "classical ballistic systems @xcite were investigated as well as diffusive systems @xcite and the crossover between both @xcite .",
    "it turns out that not only diffusive systems exhibit a minigap , but also ballistic systems with a chaotic classical motion @xcite .    at this point",
    ", one might think that such structures are sufficiently explored and all relevant properties are understood . however , recently levchenko reported the finding of a dip in the ldos close to the gap edge @xmath2 for short diffusive josephson junctions with ideal contacts @xcite .",
    "actually , this dip was already seen in former publications @xcite , however , no special attention was paid to it . in a previous work @xcite",
    "we found the peculiar result that the suppression of the ldos at @xmath2 is not limited to a dip , but a secondary gap of finite width appears for a diffusive system or chaotic cavity with the normal region connected through ballistic contacts to the superconductors .",
    "this secondary gap has a finite width as a function of the superconducting phase difference @xmath9 symmetrically around zero and closes with the characteristic shape of a `` smile '' .",
    "it is situated directly below the superconducting gap edge @xmath2 for large @xmath10 . for decreasing @xmath11",
    "the upper edge of the secondary gap detaches from @xmath2 and the gap vanishes completely below a critical value of @xmath11 .",
    "we have furthermore shown that the secondary gap is robust against asymmetries in the setup , comprising a difference in ballistic couplings or a weak spatial dependence .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate a wide range of possible nonballistic contacts and show that the secondary `` smile''-gap is not only an exotic feature which appears for ballistic contacts , but is a more general property of short diffusive or chaotic josephson systems . using quasiclassical green s functions in the form of the quantum circuit theory ,",
    "we begin by generalizing our ballistic calculations to contacts with constant transmission eigenvalues @xmath12 , for which we calculate the density of states as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath9 .",
    "we find a secondary gap which scales for large @xmath11 like in the ballistic case . in a specific example of contacts described by different constant transmission eigenvalues",
    "we show that one is not limited to a single secondary gap , but this gap can be split up into multiple subgaps .",
    "numerical considerations of continuous transmission distributions ( diffusive , dirty , double ballistic contacts ) suggest that the secondary gap below the superconducting gap edge vanishes if the contacts include channels with close - to - zero transmission coefficients .",
    "we prove this conjecture by an analytical calculation . by considering asymmetric setups with a tunnel contact on one and a ballistic contact on the other side we show however , that in this case a secondary gap can exist at slightly smaller energies . by considering a 3-node system",
    "we show that although the ldos varies at different nodes the secondary gap appears either in all nodes or in none of them .",
    "it should as well be observable in the integrated dos of the normal part .",
    "finally , we provide a simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) model in order to describe transmission through the normal region , which is able to explain the `` smile '' shape of the secondary gap .",
