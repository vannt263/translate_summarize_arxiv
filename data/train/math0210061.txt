    "the importance of homoclinic orbits in dynamical systems theory was first realised by poincar @xcite , who showed that the presence of a homoclinic tangle in the three - body problem was enough to show that the system was non - integrable .",
    "more work on homoclinic tangles was later undertaken by birkhoff @xcite , but modern interest was inspired by smale , who showed that any system with a transverse homoclinic point must have a horseshoe in some iterate @xcite . in this paper , we extend the local analysis of smale to obtain a global understanding of the dynamics for diffeomorphisms in two dimensions .",
    "the analysis depends on constructing a _ graph representative _ of the system , from which we obtain information about the dynamics in terms of _ symbolic dynamics _ relative to a markov partition and _",
    "global shadowing_.    the use of markov partitions to give symbolic dynamics is a fundamental tool in dynamical systems theory . for uniformly - hyperbolic systems ,",
    "the dynamics is described completely by the symbolics , but for non - uniformly hyperbolic systems , the markov partition typically only gives a _ lower bound _ for the dynamics . from this , we can often deduce information on the _ forcing relation _",
    ", which describes when the presence of a particular geometric structure implies the existence of another structure .",
    "sharkovskii s theorem for interval maps is a classic example of a forcing result : a total ordering @xmath0 of the natural numbers is given such that the presence of a periodic orbit of period @xmath1 forces periodic orbits of all periods @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "sharkovskii s theorem can be strengthened to consider the ordering of points on the orbit , and this gives a complete ( though less elegant ) description of the forcing relation for periodic orbits of interval maps .",
    "interval maps can be studied by elementary methods , but obtaining symbolic dynamics for more complicated classes of system typically requires the use of some topological index theory , such as the fixed point index @xcite or the conley index @xcite .",
    "the theory of isotopy classes of surface diffeomorphisms relative to periodic orbits is known as _ nielsen - thurston theory _ @xcite . here",
    ", the period is no longer a useful characterisation of the orbit ; instead , we need to consider the _ braid type _ which is the conjugacy class of isotopy classes relative to the orbit in question .",
    "just as for periodic orbits of interval maps , orbits of different periods may have different braid types .",
    "for each braid type there is a canonical representative such that a braid type @xmath4 forces @xmath5 if and only if the _ thurston minimal representative _ of @xmath4 contains an orbit of type @xmath5 .",
    "a thurston minimal representative has the minimum number of periodic points of any period , and minimal topological entropy in the isotopy class @xcite .",
    "the most interesting case is when the canonical representative is pseudo - anosov .",
    "a pseudo - anosov map preserves a pair of transverse foliations , the leaves of the stable foliation being uniformly contracted and the unstable foliation being uniformly expanded .",
    "pseudo - anosov maps therefore exhibit a type of uniformly hyperbolic behaviour , and thurston s classification theorem can be seen as a persistence result for this hyperbolicity .    unfortunately , thurston s original proof was non - constructive , and thus of little use in actually determining the forcing relation .",
    "it was not until an algorithm of los @xcite that computations became possible .",
    "los algorithm was soon followed by an algorithm which was discovered independently by franks and misiurewicz @xcite and bestvina and handel @xcite .",
    "a description of the moves of this algorithm with an emphasis on implementation details was given by keil @xcite .",
    "even so , the global properties of the forcing relation are still only partially understood and this is an active area of research @xcite .    a more challenging problem is to consider the dynamics of surface diffeomorphisms relative to homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits of tangles .",
    "the standard results of poincar and smale for transverse homoclinic points have since been extended to topologically transverse intersections which are not geometrically transverse @xcite , and a great deal is known about bifurcations near a homoclinic tangency @xcite .",
    "the global dynamics and the forcing relation have been previously considered by mcrobie and thompson @xcite , who carried out a detailed study of the _ spiral @xmath6-shoe _ , by rom - kedar @xcite , who obtained results on entropy bounds and homoclinic forcing using a _",
    "topological approximation method _ , and by easton @xcite .",
    "algorithms for computing dynamics forced by homoclinic orbits were recently given independently by handel @xcite and hulme @xcite .",
    "homoclinic tangles have been used by christiansen and politi @xcite to compute generating partitions for symbolic dynamics .",
    "orbits of the hnon map have also been obtained using continuation methods by sterling , dullin and meiss @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a complete and general theoretical basis for describing and computing the dynamics forced by a homoclinic or heteroclinic tangle .",
    "the results are a completion of the theory begun in @xcite , and are related to the pruning theory of de carvalho @xcite . instead of considering an entire tangle , which consists of immersed curves of infinite length , we only consider a subset consisting of curves of finite length .",
    "we call such a figure a _ trellis _ , after birkhoff @xcite and easton @xcite . aside from being easier to work with , trellises have the advantage that there exist a number of algorithms to compute them to a very high degree of accuracy , such as those of simo @xcite and krauskopf and osinga @xcite .",
    "we therefore obtain results which can be directly applied to physically - relevant systems . in section  [ sec : tangletrellis ] we give a formal description of trellises and discuss the features of their geometry which we shall need later .    in section  [ sec : biasymptoticminimal ]",
    ", we we show how to relate a collection of homoclinic and/or heteroclinic orbits to a canonical trellis type forcing the same dynamics , thus unifying the viewpoints of homoclinic / heteroclinic orbits and tangles .",
    "this result can be applied to classify homoclinic orbits by braid type . in particular , is is straightforward to obtain a classification of _ horseshoe homoclinic orbits _",
    ", which are homoclinic orbits of the smale horseshoe map .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we try to mimic the results of nielsen - thurston theory as closely as possible .",
    "while the fact that we are dealing with homoclinic orbits often complicates matters , it sometimes can yield simplifications . in section  [ sec : graph ] , we show how to associate a graph representative to a given trellis map , in much the same way that a pseudo - anosov braid type gives rise to a train track .",
    "the graph we obtain is unique ( unlike a train track ) and gives a convenient way of specifying the trellis . from this",
    ", we also obtain a canonical graph representative for a homoclinic orbit .",
    "we consider the problem of computing the graph representative in section  [ sec : algorithm ] .",
    "we give and algorithm modelled on the bestvina - handel algorithm , but again the invariant manifolds simplify matters by enabling us to avoid the notorious valence-@xmath7 homotopies of the graph map .",
    "we follow an idea of los @xcite by replacing the valence-@xmath7 homotopy by a _ valence-@xmath6 homotopy _ which does not require a global knowledge of the map .",
    "unfortunately , los analysis of the effect of the move on entropy was erroneous ; the entropy may increase during this move , and this meant that the algorithm was not proved to terminate .",
    "our analysis goes along different lines and avoids entropy computations altogether .",
    "we also unify the process of absorbing into the peripheral subgraph with the main algorithm , which also simplifies matters somewhat . as with the bestvina - handel algorithm ,",
    "reductions are obtained and dealt with accordingly .",
    "finally , we give a simplified algorithm for braid types based on our analysis of the algorithm for trellises .    in section  [ sec : shadowing ] , we discuss how the dynamics of the graph representative model the dynamics of the surface diffeomorphism .",
    "these results are based on the _ relative periodic point theory _ developed in @xcite .",
    "we first deduce the existence of periodic orbits ; the existence of other orbits follows by taking limits .",
    "in particular , these results show that the topological entropy of the graph representative is a lower bound for the topological entropy of the surface diffeomorphism .",
    "this lower bound is called the _ nielsen entropy _ , since it is related to the growth rate of the number of essential nielsen classes of period-@xmath8 orbits .",
    "orbits are related by _",
    "global shadowing _",
    ", a relation introduced by katok , though here we give a new definition more in keeping with the spirit of our topological analysis .",
    "one important fact is that periodic orbits which globally shadow each other have the same braid type , so we obtain information about the braid types of the orbits of the system .",
    "finally , we show be a careful construction that homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits of the graph map are shadowed by homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits of the surface diffeomorphism .",
    "the final section , section  [ sec : entropy ] , is devoted to showing that the dynamics computed by our algorithm is indeed all the dynamics forced by the trellis . in particular , the lower entropy bound computed by the algorithm is sharp .",
    "unfortunately , unlike nielsen - thurston theory , there may not be a canonical diffeomorphism whose topological entropy equals the entropy bound given by the nielsen entropy .",
    "we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a diffeomorphism whose entropy equals the nielsen entropy .",
    "we also show that by carefully extending the original trellis , we can always find a diffeomorphism whose entropy approximates the nielsen entropy arbitrarily closely .",
    "finally , we complete the link with nielsen - thurston theory by finding pseudo - anosov maps which approximate the nielsen entropy when such maps exist for the given trellis type .",
    "a unifying theme throughout this paper is to consider isotopy classes of curves embedded in the surface .",
    "we are particularly concerned with curves that have the minimum possible number of intersections with the stable curves of the trellis .",
    "stable curves can be thought of as cohomology classes , though we do not use this interpretation here , as the abelian homology theory is insufficient for many of our constructions , which require the non - abelian homotopy groups .",
    "many of the results we need are intuitively obvious `` folk theorems , '' but we give complete proofs in appendix  [ sec : isotopytheory ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the geometry of homoclinic and heteroclinic tangles , and introduce trellises , trellis mapping classes and trellis types , which are our main topic of study .",
    "we give a number of definitions which allow us to describe some of the properties of trellises .",
    "we discuss reducibility of trellis mapping classes , and explain how this differs from reducibility of mapping classes of surface diffeomorphisms .",
    "finally , we discuss the the procedure of cutting along the unstable set , which gives us a way of relating trellis maps to maps of topological pairs , and hence a way of studying the dynamics .",
    "a tangle is the figure formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of a collection of periodic saddle orbits .",
