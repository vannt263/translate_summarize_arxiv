    "the first problem is as follows .",
    "given a closed smooth curve @xmath8 , study the shape of a compact cmc surface @xmath6 whose boundary is @xmath9 .",
    "for example , we ask whether the geometry of @xmath10 imposes restrictions to the possible configurations of @xmath6 , such as , if the symmetries of @xmath10 are inherited by @xmath6 . to be precise ,",

    "when the surface is embedded we can apply the so - called alexandrov reflection method ( or the method of moving planes ) based on the maximum principle for elliptic partial differential equations of second order , which consists in a process of reflection about planes , using the very surface as a barrier @xcite .",
