    "consider a contact network composed of four persons shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem chain n=4 ] . a node shown as a circle represents an individual .",
    "a link connecting two nodes represents a dyadic relationship .",
    "suppose that you are in a managerial position to urge them to communicate with each other to induce coordination among them as soon as possible . because communication is generally costly , you may be interested in making the number or total time of communication small .",
    "the four individuals are assumed to be too conservative or time - restricted to change the network structure themselves , such that they would only discuss the matter with their extant neighbours .",
    "in addition , pairwise communication events may be a main method to exchange information between individuals due to a social norm , the capacity of each individual or the property of the matter to be discussed .",
    "in this situation , which pair of individuals should initiate discussion first ? does coordination take place faster if you force them to discuss starting from the leftmost pair to the rightmost pair along the chain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem chain n=4](a ) ; the number on the link represents the order of pairwise interaction ) .",
    "alternatively , is it better for the two individuals in the middle to communicate last and after the other two pairs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem chain n=4](b ) ) , or vice versa ( fig .  [ fig : schem chain n=4](c ) ) ?    motivated by this fictive example ,",
    "in the present study we ask how we can possibly accelerate coordination in a given social network by engineering the order of links to be used . for example , the chain network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem chain n=4 ] has four nodes and three links .",
    "thanks to symmetry , the three orders with which to use all links just once shown in the figure exhaust all possibilities .",
    "the order of link usage , which we call the link order , may impact the speed of coordination among the four nodes ( and it in fact does ) .",
    "specificity of the link order generally influences dynamics occurring on temporal networks @xcite .",
    "we examine linear diffusion on networks under link switching dynamics and quantify how different link orders yield different levels of coordination at a final time .",
    "we also propose a simple greedy algorithm to accelerate coordination .",
    "the effect of the link order on collective dynamics or performance of networks has been examined in at least two fields .",
    "first , in the study of cellular automata including random boolean networks , different methods to update the states of cells , such as synchronous updating ( i.e. , update all cells simultaneously ) versus asynchronous updating ( i.e. , update cells one by one ) and deterministic versus stochastic updating , have been shown to influence dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , specific link orders do not seem to be of a primary question in this field .",
    "second , scheduling of link orders has been formulated and optimised via mathematical programming techniques in the context of wireless networks , where links are used for transmission and conventionally interfere with each other @xcite",
    ". however , the objective functions and constraints of these models are specific to wireless communications .",
    "consider a static and unweighted network having @xmath0 nodes and @xmath1 links .",
    "we allow multiedges , which are counted as distinct links .",
    "we assume that each node carries continuous state @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) that varies over time according to linear diffusive dynamics .",
    "we sequentially apply links , say , @xmath4 , to the network to induce linear diffusive dynamics with a coupling strength of unity , corresponding to a pairwise conversation event towards coordination between the @xmath5th and @xmath6th nodes .",
    "the duration of a link is denoted by @xmath7 and takes a common value for all links .",
    "the states of the other @xmath8 nodes are unchanged in this period .",
    "the application of a single link shrinks the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "in other words , the original @xmath2 and @xmath9 are mapped to @xmath11/2 + \\left[(1-e^{-2\\tau})x_j\\right]/2 $ ] and @xmath12/2 + \\left[(1+e^{-2\\tau})x_j\\right]/2 $ ] , respectively ( eqs .   and ) .",
    "then , we switch to a next link , which is applied for time @xmath7 .",
    "this procedure is repeated until all links are used exactly once .",
    "the model can be interpreted as the bounded confidence model @xcite on networks in which the interaction threshold is equal to zero ( i.e. , the two nodes interact regardless of the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the dynamics depend on the link order .",
    "there are @xmath13 link orders .",
    "the actual number of link orders is usually much smaller than @xmath13 for at least three reasons .",
    "first , multiedges introduce obvious redundancy in the count of link orders .",
    "second , symmetry in the network structure reduces the effective number of link orders .",
    "for example , the chain network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem chain n=4 ] has three distinct link orders , whereas @xmath14 .",
    "third , swapping the order of the two links that are subsequently applied does not affect the dynamics afterwards if the corresponding single - link laplacians commute .",
    "in undirected networks , this condition is met if and only if the two links that are subsequently applied are the same ( i.e. , multiedges ) or they do not share a node ( see methods ) .",
    "we introduce @xmath15 , which quantifies the level of coordination when all links have been applied just once , i.e. , at time @xmath16 .",
    "we define @xmath15 as the normalised mean distance between a pair of nodes when the initial state of each node , @xmath17 ( @xmath3 ) , obeys an independent and identical normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath18 . a practical sufficient condition for full coordination as @xmath19 is the connectedness of the temporal network aggregated over time interval @xmath20 for each @xmath5 , where @xmath21 can be selected arbitrarily @xcite .",
    "we do not consider asymptotic relaxation time , which is more commonly studied , because the present model is motivated by social settings in which pairwise interaction , i.e. , a link , is considered to be costly and would not be used infinitely many times .",
    "denote the state vector by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the transposition .",
    "we calculate @xmath15 in terms of matrix @xmath24 that maps the initial state vector @xmath25 to the final state vector @xmath26 , where @xmath24 is explicitly given by eq .  .",
    "the mean square distance between the states of two nodes is initially equal to @xmath27 .",

    ", we discuss the speed of coordination in terms of @xmath15 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we start numerical analysis with two real temporal networks obtained from human interaction data .",
    "the first data set was obtained from the sociopatterns project and was recorded from participants in a conference @xcite .",
    "although the original data have @xmath37 nodes and @xmath38 links , we have excluded one node and the two links incident to the deleted node because the speed of coordination is very sensitive to the presence or absence of this node @xcite .",

    "both networks contain multiedges .",
    "we respect the link orders in the original data sets and calculate @xmath15 .",
    "because of the finite time resolution in the recording , there are often more than one links appearing in the same time window . in this case",
    ", we follow the link order as dictated in the original data .",

    "[ fig : temporal ] .",
    "the figure indicates that coordination occurs on real temporal networks much more slowly than for typical random link orders .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous results in which we looked at the spectral gap , an alternative measure of coordination , for the same data sets @xcite .",
    "the difference between the real temporal networks and random link orders is more significant for larger values of @xmath7 .",
    "real temporal networks are slow to coordinate possibly because of temporally correlated appearance of links @xcite . in addition , coordination is not enhanced as @xmath7 increases when @xmath7 is large .",
    "small networks allow us to enumerate the link orders and compare the performance of them . in this section",
    ", we consider three small networks with @xmath44 links .",
    "we first consider the complete graph , i.e. , all node pairs are adjacent by a link .",
    "when @xmath45 , there are @xmath44 links and @xmath46 link orders .",
    "we set @xmath36 and calculate @xmath15 for all the possible link orders .",
    "the cumulative distribution of @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small](a ) .",
    "the figure indicates that the link order , in combination with the normally distributed initial states , affects @xmath15 despite that the underlying network is structureless .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is more than 20 times different between the fastest and slowest link orders .",
    "furthermore , both approximately fastest and approximately slowest cases are attained by some fractions of link orders , i.e. , not only by exponentially rare link orders .    the average , standard deviation , minimum and maximum of @xmath15 calculated on the basis of all @xmath13 link orders are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small](b ) for a range of @xmath7 .",
    "the error bar indicates the average @xmath47 standard deviation .",
    "first , except when @xmath7 is small , @xmath15 is substantially different between the fastest and slowest link orders , which extends the observation made with fig .",
    "[ fig : small](a ) .",
    "second , a large value of @xmath7 indicates that each link is applied for a long time , which might lead one to suspect that a large @xmath7 value improves coordination .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "@xmath15 decreases as @xmath7 increases only when @xmath7 is small .",
    "the fastest coordination is realised between @xmath48 and @xmath49 depending on either the average , minimum or maximum of @xmath15 is considered .",
    "when @xmath7 is large , @xmath15 increases as @xmath7 increases , deteriorating coordination .",
    "anecdotally , forcing each pair of individuals to have long discussion to ensure strong pairwise consensus does not necessarily facilitate coordination at the network level .",
    "the average , standard deviation , minimum and maximum of @xmath15 for all link orders for the cycle with @xmath50 nodes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small](c ) .",
    "the average of @xmath15 is the smallest at @xmath51 . the @xmath15 value beyond @xmath51 increases as @xmath7 increases just slightly for this network .",
    "the difference between the minimal and maximal @xmath15 values is smaller than in the case of the complete graph .",
    "nevertheless , the results are qualitatively the same as those for the complete graph .",
    "the results are similar for a network with @xmath52 nodes and @xmath44 links generated from the erds - rnyi random graph with the probability of link between a pair of nodes equal to @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : small](d ) ) .      for larger networks , it is prohibitive to determine the best link order . therefore , we seek to accelerate coordination in terms of @xmath15 by running a simple greedy algorithm ( see methods ) . for simplicity , we focus on static and unweighted model and empirical networks in this section .",
    "we first analyse the karate - club network in which a node represents a member of the club and a link represents casual interaction between two members .",
    "the network has @xmath54 nodes and @xmath55 links @xcite .",
    "the link order optimised with @xmath36 yields @xmath56 . for comparison , we also sample @xmath43 random link orders on the same static network and calculate the average and standard deviation of @xmath15 . randomly sampled link orders yield @xmath57 at @xmath36 ( average @xmath47 standard deviation ) .",
    "this result indicates that the greedy algorithm can find a link order that by far outperforms most link orders",
    ".    it may be difficult to measure @xmath7 in real settings .",
    "therefore , we assess how the link order optimised for @xmath36 performs when the dynamics are actually implemented with different @xmath7 values . for the link order optimised for @xmath36 , @xmath15",

    "@xmath15 is plotted against @xmath7 by the squares and triangles , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : d across tau](a ) .",
    "the link orders optimised for these @xmath7 values also yield @xmath15 values significantly smaller than those for typical random link orders for a range of @xmath7 . therefore , up to our numerical efforts ,",
    "engineering a link order for a certain value of @xmath7 accelerates coordination for a range of @xmath7 .",
    "we repeated the same analysis for three other networks .",
    "the results for a heterogeneous network generated by the barabsi - albert preferential attachment model ( ba model ) having @xmath60 nodes @xmath61 links @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d across tau](b ) .",
    "we set the initial network to the triangle and the number of links that each new node possesses to three .",
    "the results for a network of jazz musicians having @xmath62 nodes and @xmath63 links @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d across tau](c ) . the results for the largest connected component of the collaboration network among major network science researchers  @xcite , which has @xmath64 and @xmath65 links ,",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "the results for the three networks are qualitatively the same as those for the karate - club network .",
    "for all four networks , @xmath15 for the optimised or random link orders decreases as @xmath7 increases when @xmath7 is small .",
    "however , @xmath15 would not decrease further as @xmath7 increases when @xmath7 is large .",
    "therefore , leaving pairs of individuals for a long time to ensure strong pairwise consensus does not accelerate the formation of consensus at a network level .",
    "this result is consistent with that for real temporal networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temporal ] ) and small networks ( figs .",
    "[ fig : small](b)(d ) ) .",
    "the relaxation speed of linear diffusive dynamics is usually characterised by the eigenvalue that determines the relaxation time of the dynamics . because @xmath24 ( eq .  ) is a linear map from the initial state vector to the final state vector , the relevant eigenvalue is the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath24 in terms of the modulus , denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of @xmath24 is always equal to unity , corresponding to the perfectly synchronous mode , or the right eigenvector @xmath67 .",
    "here we examine @xmath68 , which corresponds to the spectral gap of the laplacian dynamics in continuous time under switching dynamics @xcite .",
    "if the spectral gap calculated for the ordered link sequence @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is large , coordination occurs fast when we periodically apply links @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 infinitely many times .",
    "we prefer @xmath15 to the spectral gap because pairwise conversations would not probably repeat periodically in real social situations .",
    "nevertheless , in this section we assess whether minimisation of @xmath15 also enhances the spectral gap .",
    "we compared the spectral gap for the link orders optimised in terms of @xmath15 and that for random link orders .",
    "the results for the karate - club network , ba model , jazz musician network , and collaboration network are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : lambda2 across tau](a ) , [ fig : lambda2 across tau](b),[fig : lambda2 across tau](c ) , and [ fig : lambda2 across tau](d ) , respectively . for the karate - club , jazz , and collaboration networks , the link orders optimised in terms of @xmath15 for the three values of @xmath7 yield larger spectral gaps than the mean value for random link orders , in a range of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , in the karate - club network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda2 across tau](a ) ) , the link order optimised in terms of @xmath15 at @xmath36 produces the spectral gap values that are larger than the average plus the standard deviation of typical link orders for all the examined values of @xmath7 . however , the spectral gap is only slightly larger than in the random case for the link orders optimised with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the ba model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda2 across tau](b ) ) , the optimisation in terms of @xmath15 sometimes makes the spectral gap smaller than that for typical link orders . for this network ,",
    "the link order optimised with @xmath59 is the only case in which the spectral gap for the optimised link order is larger than that for typical link orders .",
    "the present study may be extended in the following aspects .",
    "first , we provided a simple heuristic greedy algorithm to search for a link order to accelerate coordination in terms of @xmath15 .",
    "the search space is composed of all permutations on @xmath1 links .",
    "although multiedges , symmetry in the network structure and commuting single - link laplacians reduce the search space , the effective search space is generally huge even for a network with a small number of links .",
    "the current problem is a permutation - based combinatorial optimisation problem , whose famous examples include the travelling salesman problem and the quadratic assignment problem .",
    "such a problem is typically np - hard .",
    "the optimised solutions found in the present study may be local optimums .",
    "however , various approximate algorithms can find nearly optimal solutions for famous permutation - based problems @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to build heuristic algorithms for the present model that provide better solutions than those obtained in the results section .",
    "second , we only allowed isolated pairwise communications in each time period , corresponding to single - link laplacians . in real situations ,",
    "communications towards consensus may occur in a group  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the current framework to the case of group conversation . for single - link laplacians",
    ", we used eq .   to transform the linear diffusive dynamics in continuous time to that in discrete time to simplify the computation of @xmath24 , the mapping from the initial state vector to the final state vector",
    "otherwise , the calculation of @xmath24 requires computationally burdening matrix exponentials .",
    "a group conversation corresponds to a clique in the network . if cliques do not overlap in each snapshot and are of the same size within and across snapshots , a relation similar to eq .",
    "holds true @xcite , facilitating the computation of @xmath24 .",
    "third , we imposed the condition that all links are used exactly once . in real situations",
    ", it may be allowed to use the same link multiple times , and some links may not have to be used .",
    "burstiness of links and other higher - order temporal and structural correlation as present in empirical data @xcite may impact the speed of coordination . in this situation",
    ", a plausible constraint may be to fix the total number of times that single links are applied .",
    "then , the structure of the aggregate network composed of the actually used links varies across link orders .",
    "the structure of the static network is generally a strong determinant of the level of coordination ( i.e. , synchronisation ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the structure of the aggregate network , such as community structure and different levels of heterogeneity in the node s degree , may have a larger impact on @xmath15 than the link order .",
    "fourth , we assumed that the initial states of the nodes , @xmath17 ( @xmath3 ) , are independently and identically distributed . if the information about the initial or intermediate states is available , it is probably possible to devise a link order to accelerate coordination .",
    "for example , if the states of all nodes are monitored , always forcing the most distant pair of nodes in terms of @xmath72 to communicate may considerably hasten coordination of the entire network .",
    "fifth , we assumed the linear diffusion dynamics for simplicity . extening the present framework to nonlinear synchronisation dynamics and other types of dynamics is straightforward",
    "in fact , effects of temporal networks on collective dynamics have been investigated with various models @xcite .",
    "examples include nonlinear coupled dynamics towards synchronisation @xcite , the voter model @xcite , the naming game @xcite , the information cascade model @xcite , dynamics of triangular social balance @xcite , evolutionary game dynamics @xcite , and , above all , epidemic processes @xcite",
    ". the link order may add another dimension to the impact of temporal networks on these and other dynamics .",
    "the model for linear coordination dynamics is the same as that considered in our previous work , in which links are sequentially sampled without replacement @xcite .",
    "assume a static , undirected and unweighted network having @xmath0 nodes and @xmath1 links .",
    "multiedges ( i.e. , multiple links connecting the same pair of nodes ) are allowed and are counted as distinct unweighted links .",
    "the following formulation can be generalised to the case of directed and weighted networks .",
    "denote the state of the @xmath5th node by @xmath73 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the network undergoes a sequence of laplacian dynamics in continuous time in which each link is sequentially applied for time @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics for period @xmath74 during which link @xmath4 is applied are described by @xmath75 the states of the other @xmath8 nodes are not altered during this period .",
    "the states after the application of link @xmath4 are equal to @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "they are given in terms of the states before the application of the link , i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath34 , as follows : @xmath78 in short , the application of the link lessens the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath9 by factor of @xmath10 .",
    "then , we apply the next link for @xmath79 and so forth .",
    "the dynamics terminate at @xmath16 , when all @xmath1 links are applied exactly once .",
    "to describe the entire switching dynamics , we introduce the @xmath80 single - link laplacian matrix for link @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath81 .",
    "the matrix is defined by @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the other elements of @xmath81 are equal to zero .",
    "equations   and are rewritten as @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the @xmath80 identity matrix , and @xmath87 therefore , for the sequence of links @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , the final state of the network is determined by @xmath88 where @xmath89 the multiplication of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) to @xmath92 affects the @xmath5th and @xmath6th rows , modifying at most @xmath93 elements .",
    "therefore , the computation of @xmath24 requires @xmath94 time .",
    "two link orders yield the same @xmath15 value if @xmath24 is the same for the two link orders . on the basis of eq .",
    ", a sufficient condition for this is that matrices @xmath95 and @xmath96 commute for consecutively used links @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in this case , exchanging the order of @xmath97 and @xmath98 does not affect the @xmath15 value . regardless of the value of @xmath99 , this condition is equivalent to @xmath100 \\equiv l^{(ij ) } l^{(k\\ell ) } - l^{(k\\ell ) } l^{(ij ) } = 0 , \\label{eq : commutator = 0}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 $ ] is the lie bracket , also called the commutator .",

    "although the main text focuses on undirected networks , the framework is also applicable to directed networks . as in the case of undirected networks ,",
    "the @xmath15 value does not change after swapping the order of two directed links that are successively applied if the corresponding single - link laplacians commute ( i.e. , the lie bracket is equal to zero ) .",
    "however , the calculation of the lie bracket for undirected networks does not generalise to the case of directed networks .",
    "we denote by @xmath114 the @xmath80 laplacian matrix for the network composed of just a single directed link from the @xmath5th node to the @xmath6th node . in other words ,",
    "@xmath115 , @xmath116 , and all the other elements of @xmath114 are equal to zero .",
    "@xmath114 is an asymmetric matrix . as in the case of the undirected network ,",
    "the directed single - link laplacian matrices commute if the two directed links do not share a node .",
    "if the two links share one or two nodes , we obtain @xmath117 = & l^{(\\overrightarrow{ik } ) } - l^{(\\overrightarrow{ji})}\\quad ( k = j \\text { or } k\\neq",
