    "star clusters are an important tool for understanding the formation and evolution of a galaxy .",
    "being an aggregate of many stars , they are bright enough to be observed at great distances .",
    "they span a very broad range of age , from a few myrs to more than 10 gyrs , encapsulating the whole history of a galaxy .",
    "age distribution of star clusters in a galaxy tells us about the formation and destruction history of the clusters and about the evolution of the galaxy as well .",
    "spatial distribution of the star clusters delineates the structure of a galaxy , and their velocity distribution reveals the kinematics of stellar population and the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "recent studies for star clusters in nearby late type galaxies have revealed details of the star clusters , showing that the populations of star clusters are diverse among the galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "local group galaxies in the nearby universe are ideal targets , due to their proximity , for studying in detail the properties of star clusters .",
    "there are three spiral galaxies in the local group : our galaxy , m31 and m33 .",
    "while star clusters in our galaxy and m31 have been extensively studied , the star clusters in m33 received relatively less attention .",
    "m33 ( = ngc 598 ) , the triangulum galaxy , is a late type spiral galaxy ( scd ) .",
    "it is located at @xmath13 kpc from us @xcite .",
    "its large angular size and inclination of @xmath14 @xcite make it particularly suitable for studies of its stellar contents .",
    "its mass , @xmath15 @xcite , falls in the intermediate range among the local group galaxies .",
    "surveys for star cluster in m33 have been rather sporadic .",
    "early photometric surveys by @xcite and @xcite identified about 25 star cluster candidates .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of 58 possible star cluster candidates , including most of the objects studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the most comprehensive catalog of 250 non - stellar objects in m33 , including @xmath16 photometry of 60 star cluster candidates .",
    "later @xcite presented @xmath0 photometry for 71 additional star cluster candidates .",
    "all these surveys were based on the photographic plates so that they were limited rather to the outer part of m33 .    the first survey for m33 star clusters based on ccd imaging",
    "was given by @xcite using the @xmath0 images from direct project @xcite .",
    "they presented a list of 51 globular cluster candidates . while they covered the central region of m33 where previous surveys could not examine in detail , their survey was limited to the bright star clusters of @xmath17 mag , and did not cover the entire area of m33 .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) offers a great advantage over the ground - based telescopes for star cluster survey in m33 . at the distance of m33",
    ", star clusters can be easily identified without ambiguity with hst images .",
    "therefore , star cluster samples from hst images are much less likely to be contaminated by other extended sources such as a background galaxy or an h ii region .",
    "@xcite searched for star clusters in m33 with hst data for the first time .",
    "they reported a discovery of 162 star clusters including 131 previously unknown ones in the 55 fields of hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "recently , @xcite have found 33 star clusters and 51 possible candidates from the @xmath18 image of one hst / acs field .",
    "@xcite also reported a discovery of 24 star clusters including 11 new ones from the @xmath19 images of two hst / acs fields in m33 .",
    "however , the areas of m33 covered by the previous hst - based surveys are much smaller than the entire area of m33 .",
    "therefore , it is needed to increase the number of hst fields to make as complete a sample of star clusters as possible .",
    "the sample of star clusters established from the hst images also serves as a template for ground - based star cluster surveys .",
    "we searched for new m33 star clusters using the additional hst / wfpc2 images that became available after @xcite s work .",
    "we combined our result with previous m33 star cluster catalogs based on the hst images @xcite , and obtained homogeneous @xmath0 photometry for the star clusters from the deep ccd imaging data taken at the canada - france - hawaii - telescope ( cfht ) ( park et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation )    in this paper , we present the result of m33 star cluster survey with the hst / wfpc2 images . throughout this paper",
    ", we will refer the star clusters from the catalog of @xcite with b designation , and ones from @xcite with cbf .",
    "cs designation means the star clusters from @xcite , mkkss designation means the ones from @xcite , md the ones from @xcite .",
    "finally , sbghs designation means the star clusters from @xcite .",
    "the paper is composed as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the hst / wfpc2 and cfht data used in this study . in section 3 , star cluster search method and the integrated photometry procedures on cfht images",
    "are described .",
    "section 4 presents various properties of the star clusters : color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) , color - color diagrams ( ccd ) , and spatial distribution of star clusters .",
    "finally , summary and conclusion are given in the last section .",
    "we used wfpc2 images of m33 in the hst archive that were not used in the previous studies by @xcite .",
    "the images were obtained using various filter combinations of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we selected images only with exposure times longer than 100 sec either in @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the number of fields thus selected is 24 , as listed in table  [ fld_list ] .",
    "the locations of the fields are displayed on fig .",
    "[ fld_location ] , along with the locations of hst / wfpc2 fields for previous star cluster surveys @xcite .",
    "nine of our fields are partially overlapped with previous survey regions .",
    "hst / wfpc2 image sets used by @xcite were also downloaded from the archive , and images of previously known star clusters on these image sets were utilized as references for the visual search on the new image sets .",
    "bright star clusters in m33 are easily resolved on the hst / wfpc2 images so that we selected star clusters using visual inspection of each image .",
    "we considered extended objects with the hint of resolved stars as star clusters .",
    "since the hst / wfpc2 image sets used in this study have different depths , and they cover different environments in m33 with different filters , we could not put a completeness limit of the survey for each image .",
    "the detection of star clusters depends not only on the brightness of the star clusters , but also on their sizes , morphologies , and environments .",
    "experience from the visual investigation tells us that star clusters with @xmath28 can be identified in the shallowest images of the current hst / wfpc2 image sets .    from the investigation of hst / wfpc2 fields",
    ", we have found 104 star clusters , 32 of which are new ones .",
    "the 32 new star clusters are listed in table  [ newcl_list ] , and their @xmath26-band grayscale images are shown in fig .",
    "[ newcl ] . during the investigation",
    ", we identified eight cbf star clusters that were redundantly identified and registered under two different ids : cbf-15 ( cbf-45 ) , cbf-20 ( cbf-126 ) , cbf-22 ( cbf-91 ) , cbf-53 ( cbf-87 ) , cbf-54 ( cbf-85 ) , cbf-56 ( cbf-156 ) , cbf-59 ( cbf-95 ) , and cbf-60 ( cbf-94 ) .",
    "the two star clusters in each pair have not only similar coordinates , but also similar @xmath26 magnitudes with differences @xmath29 mag .",
    "we inspected carefully the hst / wfpc2 images of the regions where eight pairs are located , and we found neither two star clusters of similar magnitudes in the regions , nor any possible substructures ( i.e. multiple ob groups in a cluster ) in the clusters that @xcite might have recognized as two separate star clusters .",
    "therefore , we regard these eight cases as redundant identifications of the same star cluster . throughout this paper",
    ", we will present the total number of cbf samples as 154 instead of 162 . from these 154 cbf samples",
    ", we identified 45 star clusters on our image sets .",
    "one of our fields partially overlaps the region where @xcite searched for star clusters with an hst / acs image , where they found 33 star clusters and 51 star cluster candidates .",
    "14 star clusters and 18 star cluster candidates fall on our hst / wfpc2 image .",
    "we could identify 13 star clusters except cluster i d 15 in @xcite s list that seems to be too faint to be seen on our @xmath30 image .",
    "we also inspected the 18 star cluster candidates on our image .",
    "however , they are so compact in size that it was impossible to tell whether they are star clusters , except for cluster i d 83 in @xcite s list .",
    "we classified this one as a star cluster after careful inspection of the image .",
    "in addition , we found that 12 star cluster candidates from previous ground - based surveys @xcite are real star clusters .",
    "the coordinates , photometric properties , and cross identification among the various studies for these 71 previously known clusters are listed in table  [ othercl_list ] .",
    "we make a catalog of 242 star clusters in m33 , combining our result with the previous results based on hst - based surveys @xcite .",
    "it is the largest catalog of m33 star clusters available to date which includes only the star clusters confirmed in the hst images .",
    "it consists of 32 newly found star clusters in this study , 12 previous star cluster candidates that were confirmed to be the genuine ones in this study , 154 star clusters from @xcite , 32 star clusters out of 33 star clusters in @xcite , one star cluster from the star cluster candidate list of @xcite , and 11 new star clusters from the list of @xcite .",
    "the positions and the photometry of all m33 star clusters not included in tables  [ newcl_list ] and [ othercl_list ] are listed in table  [ prevcl_list ] .",
    "all star clusters in the combined catalog were observed with hst in different conditions with different purpose .",
    "the combination of the filters used for the hst observation varies depending on the field . to secure homogeneous photometry data for all clusters , we used the integrated photometry of these clusters derived from the ground - based images given in park et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) instead of deriving the photometry from the hst images .",
    "park et al .",
    "( 2007 ) presented @xmath0 integrated aperture photometry of clusters and cluster candidates in the @xmath31 field of m33 based on the ccd images taken with cfh12k mosaic camera at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the typical seeing of the data is @xmath32 arcsec for all filters , and the point sources of @xmath33 can be measured with errors smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "details of the photometry are given in park et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and we give a brief description here .",
    "examination of an aperture growth curve of isolated bright clusters on cfh12k ccd images indicates that most of star cluster light is contained within the aperture of @xmath35 arcsec .",
    "however , using such an aperture would cause a large scatter in the measurement of some clusters , because star clusters are often located in the crowded field in m33 so that some neighbor objects happen to be inside the same aperture .",
    "for this reason , we used an aperture of @xmath36 arcsec for the measurement of color , although the aperture of @xmath37 arcsec was used for @xmath26 magnitude measurement to measure the total light of the star clusters .",
    "some of the star clusters we missed happened to fall on the gaps between the chips in mosaic camera , and some of them happen to be located in so crowded a region that we could not derive their photometry from the cfht images .    to supplement the photometry data for star clusters that could not be measured with cfh12k data ,",
    "aperture photometry was carried out on the hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "we made photometry on the fields that were observed with more than two filters since instrumental magnitude can not be converted to standard system without color information . for most of fields ,",
    "two hst / wfpc2 images of identical pointings exist per filter .",
    "fields observed with only one exposure were not included in the measurement .",
    "two images were combined with combine task in iraf with crreject option to remove the cosmic rays .",
    "cosmetic defects were masked with data quality images that accompany the scientific images .",
    "the centers of the clusters were determined visually with iraf / imexamine task .",
    "then iraf / phot task was used to measure the instrumental magnitudes of star clusters on the combined images . to be consistent with previous hst - based studies @xcite , aperture of @xmath38 arcsec",
    "was adopted for the magnitude measurement , while aperture of @xmath39 arcsec for color measurement .",
    "local median values were measured as sky background level in the annulus of inner radius of @xmath40 arcsec and outer radius of @xmath41 arcsec around each star cluster .",
    "the cte correction was applied to the instrumental magnitudes according to the prescription given at dolphin ( 2002 ) s web site .",
    "however , we did not correct for the geometrical distortions in the wfpc2 ccd .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were converted to standard system using the relation also found at the same web site iteratively . in the end , we derived the photometry of 227 out of 242 star clusters with both cfh12k and hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "we compared our photometry of the clusters with previous photometry .",
    "there are 154 clusters in common with @xcite , 16 clusters in common with @xcite , 12 clusters in common with @xcite , and 11 clusters in common with @xcite .",
    "note that all photometry was carried out with different aperture sizes : @xcite and @xcite used nominal aperture of @xmath42 arcsec for magnitude measurement , while @xcite used apertures of @xmath43 and @xmath44 arcsec , respectively .",
    "@xcite used an aperture of @xmath45 arcsec .",
    "however , aperture sizes in all cases were determined to contain as much as possible the light from a star cluster , so the resultant aperture magnitudes for a star cluster should be more or less the same .    fig .",
    "[ photdiff ] shows the comparison of our photometry of the clusters with previous photometry .",
    "large scatter made it difficult to see the difference in magnitude , but for bright star clusters ( @xmath46 ) , there is little magnitude differences between this and other studies : @xmath47(this study@xcite ) @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath47(this study@xcite ) @xmath48 with @xmath50 , @xmath47(this study@xcite ) @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and @xmath47(this study@xcite ) @xmath48 with @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "for fainter sources , however , our measurements get systematically fainter than the other space based measurements . given that most of the star clusters are located in the region near the m33 center where crowding is severe and",
    "sky varies significantly , the sky background level was likely to be overestimated in ground - based images due to the unresolved faint stars , which would lead to a fainter estimation of source brightness .",
    "both the @xmath54 and @xmath55 colors show good agreement with all the previous studies down to the faintest magnitude in our samples .",
    "the differences between this study and other photometry are @xmath56(this study@xcite)@xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59(this study@xcite)@xmath60 with @xmath52 , @xmath56(this study@xcite)@xmath61 with @xmath52 , @xmath59(this study@xcite)@xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath56(this study@xcite)@xmath64 with @xmath65 , and @xmath59(this study@xcite)@xmath66 with @xmath65 . the only exception to",
    "this tendency is the @xmath55 difference between ours and those of @xcite , which turned out to be : @xmath59(this study@xcite ) @xmath67 with @xmath52 .      to get the intrinsic color of the star clusters ,",
    "the photometric measurements must be corrected for reddening .",
    "we estimated the foreground reddening for each star cluster using the @xmath68@xmath54 diagram for early type stars in the field covering the cluster .",
    "we used the @xmath69 photometry of stars in the area of m33 covered in the local group survey given by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath70 derived for each cluster is listed in the fourth column of table  [ newcl_list ] , [ othercl_list ] , and [ prevcl_list ] .",
    "@xmath70 values we derived for m33 star clusters range from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . for about 130 star clusters ,",
    "the value of @xmath70 turned out to be @xmath73 , and for about 100 star clusters the values of @xmath70 were found to be @xmath74 .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath70 toward their 60 star clusters either from the photometry of neighboring individual stars by applying reddening free parameters or by using @xmath70 values from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath70 values range @xmath75 , and most of them are found to be @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite also derived reddening for their 10 globular cluster samples from the shapes of the red giant branches ( rgb ) in the color - magnitude diagrams of resolved stars .",
    "their @xmath77 estimates are below @xmath34 , except for @xmath78 for cluster i d 131 ( = cs - h10 ) . @xcite also obtained @xmath77 for 17 star clusters in the same way as @xcite , which @xmath77 ranges from @xmath79 .",
    "since our error in @xmath70 measurement is as large as @xmath71 , it is quite difficult to see the consistency between our result and other results .",
    "but the fact that @xmath70 distribution shows peak at @xmath80 , a typical value found in previous studies @xcite , indicated that the result obtained in this study is in general consistent with previous studies .",
    "fig .  [ cmd ] displays the integrated @xmath81 and @xmath82 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of the star clusters in m33 .",
    "absolute magnitudes of the star clusters were derived for the adopted distance modulus of @xmath83 @xcite and the visual extinction to reddening ratio @xmath84 @xcite . for comparison , we display the cmd for the star clusters in the lmc @xcite in the panel ( c ) , and the cmds for the open clusters @xcite and globular clusters @xcite in our galaxy in panel ( d ) .",
    "we adopted a value for the foreground reddening of @xmath85 @xcite and the distance modulus of @xmath86 for the lmc clusters .",
    "several features are noted in fig .",
    "first , the star clusters in all three galaxies are roughly separated into blue and red groups with a color boundary of @xmath87 in the @xmath81 cmd .",
    "however , this separation for the m33 clusters in the @xmath82 cmd is not as clear as in the @xmath81 cmd .",
    "second , the dominant population in m33 is blue clusters , as known before @xcite .",
    "most of the new clusters found or the clusters confirmed in this study are also blue clusters .",
    "third , the brightest blue clusters in m33 are as bright as @xmath88 mag , which is similar to the value for the galactic open clusters , but about 1.5 magnitude fainter than that for the lmc .",
    "fourth , the blue envelope for the blue clusters in m33 in the @xmath89@xmath3 cmd is slightly redder than that for the lmc blue clusters , as seen from the normalized @xmath3 color histograms in the panel ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "fifth , there are only a small number of red clusters with @xmath90 in m33 .",
    "the @xmath3 color range of the red clusters in m33 , @xmath91 , is similar to that for the galactic globular clusters , but is much larger than that for the lmc red clusters , @xmath92 .",
    "we found only one new red cluster , and confirmed two known red clusters .",
    "cluster i d 85 ( i d 27 in @xcite ) , one of the two red clusters confirmed in this study , happens to be the brightest ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) among the known red clusters in m33 .",
    "the reddest cluster is cluster i d 89 , which has integrated colors @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are only a few red star clusters that are fainter than @xmath97 in m33 , while there are many such faint red star clusters seen in the lmc .",
    "the lack of faint red clusters in our catalog of m33 clusters may be due to incompleteness of our cluster search or may be an intrinsic feature of the m33 star cluster system .",
    "while we selected hst / wfpc2 images on the basis of @xmath26 or @xmath27 exposure times , many of resultant image sets were obtained with combinations of @xmath26 and shorter wavelength passbands such as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , rather than the combinations of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "so there is a possibility that our star cluster detection might have been biased toward blue star clusters .",
    "however , it may be an intrinsic feature , considering that @xcite already showed that m33 red star clusters with @xmath100 has log normal type luminosity function ( lf ) , while intermediate color clusters with @xmath101 show no turnover down to the completeness limit in their lf .",
    "[ ccd ] shows the integrated @xmath3@xmath9 color - color diagram ( ccd ) of m33 star clusters , along with @xmath3 and @xmath9 histograms of m33 star clusters .",
    "galactic globular clusters are also plotted for comparison .",
    "we overlaid the theoretical evolutionary path for the single stellar population ( ssp ) @xcite for @xmath7 , @xmath8 that was reported to give the best overall fit to their m33 star cluster samples which younger than @xmath102 @xcite . for comparison , evolutionary path of ssp for @xmath103",
    ", @xmath104 is also overlaid .",
    "most of the new clusters in m33 including the ones from @xcite are located along the sequence that is consistent with the theoretical evolutionary path for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , while a few of them are in the redder side in the @xmath9 color .",
    "this is similar to the case of previously known clusters in m33 and also to the case of the star clusters in m51 @xcite .",
    "some bright clusters among these redder clusters are consistent with the theoretical evolutionary path for @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "however , the rest of them can not be explained with any other models .",
    "the continuous distribution of star clusters along the model line indicates that m33 star clusters have been formed continuously from the epoch of the first star cluster formation until recent time .",
    "the @xmath9 distribution shows only one peak at @xmath105 and monotonically decrease toward red end , while the @xmath3 distribution shows two distinct peaks at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution is similar to that given by @xcite , except that the red peak at @xmath107 in our result , is 0.1 bluer than their result , @xmath108 .",
    "the blue peak corresponds to the age of @xmath109 year and the red one to the age of @xmath110 year , if we assume the metallicity of the star clusters , @xmath7 .",
    "based on the integrated photometry of the clusters , we can select old globular cluster candidates from our catalog .",
    "the @xmath3 color distribution shows the blue end of red star cluster population is located at @xmath111 , which is similar to that of galactic globular clusters .",
    "although we do not see any similar red peak at @xmath9 color distribution of m33 star clusters , it is reasonable to set the color criterion for @xmath9 color as well , in accordance with the @xmath9 distribution of galactic globular clusters .",
    "the color ranges for most of galactic globular clusters in fig .",
    "[ ccd ] are @xmath1 and @xmath112 .",

    "[ gccand_list ] , along with their integrated photometry and cross identifications with previous catalogs .",
    "nine out of ten globular clusters in @xcite satisfy our color selection criterion .",
    "one globular cluster , c38 in @xcite ( = cbf-114 ) , is not included because its color @xmath113 is a little bluer than the blue limit of the criterion .",
    "our list of 29 globular cluster candidates also includes three oldest star clusters in the list of @xcite , clusters i d 58 , 131 , and 228 that are all estimated to be older than @xmath114 .",
    "we divided the m33 star cluster sample into three groups according to their @xmath3 color for further analysis : blue star clusters with @xmath115 , intermediate color star clusters with @xmath5 , and red star clusters with @xmath116 .",
    "[ spatial_dist ] displays the spatial distribution of each color group .",
    "we also plotted for comparison the locations of h ii regions @xcite that trace well the spiral arm structures of m33 .",
    "since hst / wfpc2 observations covered in our catalog do not cover the entire area of m33 , the spatial distribution of star clusters can not be used for the study of spatial structure of the m33 cluster system .",
    "[ spatial_dist ] shows that the red clusters are found relatively more in the outer region of m33 than the blue and intermediate color clusters , and that many of the blue stars are located in the hii regions .",

    "[ fld_location ] for locations of these fields . ) . had any star clusters been found in these regions , it would give a clue on the extent of star cluster system in m33 .",
    "however , no star clusters were found in these regions with our image sets .      with the largest sample of star clusters available , we derived the luminosity function ( lf ) of star clusters , displaying it in fig .",

    "[ lf](a ) .",
    "thus it is natural that our lfs include a higher portion of faint star clusters than those of @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a survey of star clusters in m33 using the hst / wfpc2 images in the hst archive that were not covered in the previous studies .",
    "we have found 104 stars clusters including 32 new clusters and 12 known clusters confirmed in this study from 24 fields of hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "we combined 44 star clusters from this study , 154 star clusters from @xcite , 33 star clusters from @xcite , and 11 star clusters from @xcite , to build a catalog of 242 star clusters .",
    "this is the most comprehensive catalog available to date which contains only the confirmed genuine star clusters in m33 .",
    "we present the integrated photometry of these star clusters derived from the @xmath0 images taken with the cfh12k ccd camera at the cfht .",
    "photometric properties of the star clusters are summarized as follows :    * the integrated color - magnitude diagram of star clusters shows that there are two distinct populations in m33 : a large number of blue star clusters and a small number of red star clusters .",
    "the cmd of the m33 star clusters is in general similar to that of the lmc star clusters .",
    "* we divide the cluster sample into three groups according to their @xmath3 color : blue star clusters with @xmath115 , intermediate color star clusters with @xmath5 , and red star clusters with @xmath116 .",
    "most of the new clusters found or confirmed in this study are blue clusters .",
    "there are 29 old globular cluster candidates with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , ten of which are newly found in this study .",
    "* most of the new clusters in m33 are located along the theoretical evolutionary path for @xmath7 , @xmath8 in @xmath3@xmath9 color - color diagram , while a few of them are in the redder side in the @xmath9 color . *",
    "the red clusters are found relatively more in the outer region of m33 than the blue and intermediate color clusters , and that many of the blue stars are located in the hii regions .",
    "* the luminosity function ( lf ) for the blue star clusters shows a peak at @xmath10 mag , while the intermediate color star cluster lf shows a peak at the fainter magnitude @xmath11 mag .",
    "the lf for the red star clusters shows also a peak at @xmath12 , although the number of the clusters is small .",
