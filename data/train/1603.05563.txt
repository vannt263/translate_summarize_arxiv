    "the solar wind electric sail ( e - sail ) is a concept how to propel a spacecraft in the solar system using the natural solar wind ( sw ) @xcite . the e - sail uses a number of thin metallic and centrifugally stretched tethers which are biased at high positive potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig : esail ] ) . the biasing is effected by an onboard electron gun which continuously pumps out negative charge from the tethers .",
    "the following secular spinrate change problem was , however , identified @xcite . when an e - sail orbits around the sun with the sail inclined with respect to the sw , the orbital coriolis effect causes a secular increase or decrease of the spinrate .",
    "inclining the sail is necessary if one wants to produce transverse thrust perpendicular to the sw direction , which is usually the case . specifically , if the sail is inclined so that it brakes the orbital motion and keeps the spacecraft spiralling towards the sun , the spinrate decreases , and if the sail is inclined in the opposite way so that the orbit is an outward moving spiral , the spinrate increases .",
    "the rate of spinrate increase or decrease obeys approximately the equation @xmath65 here @xmath64 is the angular frequency of the heliocentric orbit and @xmath58 is the sail angle , i.e.  the ( positive ) angle between the sail spin axis and the sw direction .",
    "for example if @xmath58 is @xmath66 and the spacecraft is in a circular orbit at 1 au distance , the spinrate changes by 9% in each week . to overcome the problem ,",
    "various technical solutions were proposed and analysed , for example the use of ionic liquid field - effect electric propulsion ( feep ) thrusters @xcite or photonic blades @xcite on the remote units .    in this paper",
    "we present a novel design concept ( the ti tether rig ) for the e - sail which overcomes the secular spinrate problem and yields a technically simple hardware .",
    "we also present a control algorithm and demonstrate by detailed numerical simulation that the algorithm is able to fly the e - sail in real sw with full capability to control the orientation of the spin plane and the spinrate .",
    "we also demonstrate that the algorithm is able to accomplish its task using a simple set of sensors ( remote unit position imager and vector accelerometer ) with realistic amount of measurement noise .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we show that electric auxtethers enable spinrate control , present the ti tether rig design , the control algorithm , the dynamical simulation model and the simulation results .",
    "the paper closes with summary and conclusions .",
    "we consider an e - sail as in fig .",
    "[ fig : elaux3d ] where the auxiliary tethers ( auxtethers ) are metallic and can be biased at high voltage , similarly to the maintethers .",
    "a segment of an auxtether then generates e - sail thrust which is perpendicular to it .",
    "our aim is then to show that if the auxtether voltages can be controlled independently from the maintether voltages , spinrate control becomes possible .     with respect to sw flow (",
    "@xmath58 lies in the @xmath67 plane ) .",
    "lines below @xmath68 plane are drawn in greyscale to ease visualisation .",
    "the @xmath69 coordinate is along the sw . ]",
    "figure [ fig : elaux2d]a again shows an e - sail inclined at angle @xmath58 to the sw flow , but now viewed from the top , antiparallel to the @xmath70 axis . consider a maintether in the @xmath67 plane i.e.  in the plane of fig .",
    "[ fig : elaux2d]a .",
    "the maintether generates a thrust vector @xmath16 which is perpendicular to itself .",
    "figure [ fig : elaux2d]b shows the same maintether @xmath71 rotation later when it is parallel to @xmath70 axis .",
    "now , because the tether is perpendicular to the sw , its thrust vector @xmath16 is aligned with the sw .",
    "we decompose @xmath16 in spinplane component @xmath20 and spinplane normal component @xmath18 .",
    "the spinplane component @xmath20 brakes the tether s spinrate when it moves upstream and accelerates it @xmath72 rotation later , and the net effect vanishes .",
    "panel [ fig : elaux2d]c is the same as panel [ fig : elaux2d]b , but we have added a charged auxtether segment at the tip of the maintether .",
    "the thrust vector @xmath16 is now a vector sum of the maintether thrust and the auxtether thrust .",
    "the maintether thrust is still along the sw flow as it was in [ fig : elaux2d]b , but the auxtether s thrust contribution is perpendicular to the auxtether , i.e.  perpendicular to the spin plane . as a result , @xmath16 is not aligned with the sw and the ratio @xmath73 depends on the ratio of the auxtether thrust versus the maintether thrust . in particular , by modulating the auxtether and maintether voltages separately , the ratio @xmath73 can be different when the maintether is parallel or antiparallel with the @xmath70 axis . by having the same @xmath74 but different @xmath75 in the upstream and downstream portions of the maintether s rotation cycle",
    ", we can modify the sail s spin rate while keeping its orientation fixed .",
    "separate control of sail spinrate and spinplane orientation becomes possible because one has two control parameters in each angular segment , namely maintether voltage and auxtether voltage .",
    "to enable separate control of auxtether and maintether voltages , one could use various technical means , for example , each remote unit could carry a potentiometer or other means of regulating the auxtether voltage between zero and the maintether voltage . however , we propose a simpler arrangement where the remote units need no active parts .",
    "we propose that even - numbered maintethers are such that their remote unit is galvanically connected with both the left - side and right - side auxtethers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , blue ) , while odd - numbered maintethers are electrically insulated from the remote unit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , red ) .",
    "we call the even - numbered tethers the t - tethers because of the t - shaped shape of the blue equipotential region , and odd - numbered tethers are correspondingly called i - tethers .        in a given angular sector of the sail ,",
    "we can effectively increase ( decrease ) the auxtether voltages by setting t - tethers to higher ( lower ) voltage than i - tethers .",
    "the auxtethers are always at the same potential as their associated t - tether so that no potentiometers or other functional parts are needed on the remote units .",
    "two types of remote units are needed : ones that provide galvanic connection between the maintether and the two auxtethers , and ones that provide an insulating connection between all three connecting tethers .",
    "as usual , the remote units contain reels of the auxtethers which are used during deployment phase . during propulsive flight",
    ", no functionality is required from the remote units .",
    "the units only have to continue to provide the mechanical and electrical connection which is of galvanic and insulating type of even and odd - numbered units , respectively .",
    "because of the presence of t - tethers and i - tethers , we call the design as a whole the ti tether rig .",
    "the control algorithm consists of six throttling factors which are multiplied together at the end to yield the voltage throttling of each maintether .",
    "the six factors and their roles in the control algorithm are listed in table [ tab : factors ] .",
    ".the six throttling factors . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ tab : controlparams ]",
    "all simulations start from an initial state where the sail rotates perpendicular to the sw .",
    "synthetic constant sw is used in first three runs . in the last run",
    ", real sw is used . in all",
    "runs the thrust is modulated by @xmath76 so that it starts off gradually from zero .",
    "this is done to avoid inducing tether oscillations as an initial transient : although the algorithm can damp such oscillations , damping would not occur immediately .    in run 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : run1 ] ) , the tilt angle goal ( panel a ) is zero until 12 h , then it is set to 45@xmath77 where it remains for 18 hours .",
    "the sail starts turning when the angle is set and reaches almost @xmath78 angle after 18 hours .",
    "then the @xmath79 angle goal is changed from 90@xmath77 to -90@xmath77 so that the sail starts turning again , via zero to the opposite direction . at 48 h",
    "the @xmath58 angle goal is returned back to zero .",
    "thus , run 1 exercises a back and forth swing of the tether rig .",
    "spinrate regulation greediness parameter @xmath29 is set to zero in run 1 so that we can observe the natural tendency of the spinrate to vary during the turning manoeuvre . the spinrate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : run1 ] , panel d ) increases up to 25% from the initial value when the sail reaches @xmath80 angle .",
    "the increase is due to conservation of the sun - directed angular momentum component @xmath81 : @xmath82 must increase if @xmath83 increases while @xmath81 remains constant .     between sw and spin axis ; ( b ) @xmath84 ( @xmath70 component of spin axis unit vector @xmath46 ) ; ( c ) @xmath85 ( @xmath69 component of @xmath46 ) ; ( d ) spin angular momentum relative to initial angular momentum in percent ; ( e ) thrust along sw ( blue , @xmath86 ) , perpendicular to it ( green , @xmath87 ) and total ( black ) ; ( f ) tether instantaneous minimum , mean and maximum voltages .",
    "in a - d , thicker grey and pastel lines show the commanded goal of each parameter . ]",
    "the thrust direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : run1 ] , panel e ) varies according to the spinplane orientation .",
    "the total thrust is somewhat smaller when the spinplane is actively turned , which is due to the fact some tethers are then throttled in voltage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : run1 ] , panel f ) .    in run 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : run2 ] ) , the goal @xmath58 angle is put to @xmath66 throughout .",
    "the spinrate control greediness parameter @xmath28 is put to its normal value of 2.0 .",
    "the spinrate goal is 110% spin for the first 18 hours and is put to very large value after that .",
    "the controller turns the spinplane smoothly to @xmath66 which also increases the spinrate moderately because of @xmath81 conservation .",
    "when the spinrate goal is put high , the spinrate starts to increase almost linearly , reaching 60% increase at the end of the run which is 2.25 days since setting the spinrate goal high . as a byproduct of the spinrate increase part of the algorithm , the sail angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : run2 ] , panel a ) decreases slightly from @xmath66 to about @xmath88 .",
    "the reason is that the spinrate modification and tilt angle modification parts of the controller algorithm slightly compete with each other because both use the same tether voltages for actuation .",
    "we do not expect this competition to be a practical issue because usually ( to compensate the secular trend ) the wanted spinrate change is much slower than in run 2 . in any case , run 2 shows that if needed for any reason , the spinrate can be increased in a matter of few days with the model sail .",
    "but for run 2 : demonstration of rapid spin increase .",
    "]    run 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : run3 ] ) is similar to run 2 , but now we demonstrate decreasing rather than increaseing of the spinrate .",
    "the spinrate goal is put to 40% at 18 h. the spin slows down obediently . in this case",
    "the sail angle increases somewhat above the goal value @xmath66 .",
    "but for run 3 : demonstration of spin decrease .",
    "]    finally , in run 4 we simulate a typical use case of the e - sail .",
    "we set the sail angle @xmath58 goal to @xmath66 and the spinrate goal at 100% . in run 4",
    "we also use real sw data to drive the e - sail where @xmath89 corresponds to epoch january 1 , 2000 , 00:00 ut .",
    "the used sw data comes from nasa / gsfcv s omni 1-minute resolution dataset through omniweb ( fig .",

    "are shown as grey . ]",
    "gaps in omni data were filled by the following simple algorithm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gaprm ] ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be the data which has a gap at @xmath90 .",
    "mirror the data before @xmath48 to make a function @xmath91 .",
    "now , function @xmath92 fills the gap @xmath93 $ ] with data that has the same spectral content as the real data @xmath94 . the filler",
    "@xmath92 has , however , a discontinuity where the gap ends at @xmath49 and we return to real data @xmath95 . to remedy this ,",
    "we carry out a similar procedure at the other end , mirroring data around @xmath49 to get @xmath96 .",
    "finally we construct the filler @xmath97 , @xmath90 , by linear interpolation between @xmath92 and @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "we have presented a new e - sail design and its accompanying control algorithm and sensor set which satisfies the following requirements :    1 .",
    "control of tether voltages from the main spacecraft is the only actuation mechanism .",

    "3 .   delivery of the wanted amount of e - sail thrust .",
    "4 .   spinrate acceleration and deceleration capability . with typical parameters ,",
    "the spinrate modification control authority is many times larger than what is needed to overcome the heliocentric orbit coriolis effect .",
    "remote units have no functionality requirements after deployment .",
    "algorithmic automatic capability to damp tether oscillations . 7 .",
    "both maintethers and auxtethers are biased and thereby propulsive .",
    "only two sensors are needed : remote unit angular position detection by imaging and accelerometer .",
    "moderate resolution sufficies for the imaging sensors . 10 .",
    "the accelerometer should have low noise ( @xmath101 ) , but devices exist ( e.g.  colibrys sf-1500 ) whose noise level is even five times less .    in the simulations of this paper we did not study deployment , but an obvious question is if the spinrate increase capability of the algorithm would be enough to deploy the sail in reasonable time . based on our preliminary analysis",
    ", the answer seems to be yes , provided that deployment to a few hundred metre tether length is first achieved by some other means .",
    "another future work that could be performed with our simulation is systematic analysis of average and maximum tether tension . although not reported here , we have already monitored tether tension in our simulations , and the version of the control algorithm presented in this paper ( table [ tab : controlparams ] ) was arrived at partly by trial and error minimisation of the maximum tether tension when thrust was kept fixed .    we think that the ti tether rig is a significant step forward in e - sail design particularly because it enables full control of the angular momentum vector while not requiring any functionality from the remote units during flight . as a result ,",
