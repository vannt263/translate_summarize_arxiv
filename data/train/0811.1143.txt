    "relativistic jets are routinely observed emerging from active galactic nuclei and microquasars , and presumably they are behind the phenomenology detected in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "it is a broadly recognized fact that the observed vlbi radio - maps of parsec - scale jets are not a direct map of the physical state ( density , pressure , velocity , magnetic field ) of the emitting plasma .",
    "the emission structure is greatly modified by the fact that a distant ( earth ) observer detects the radiation emitted from a jet which moves at relativistic speed and forms a certain angle with respect to the line of sight .",
    "time delays between different emitting regions , doppler boosting and light aberration shape decisively the observed aspect of every time - dependent process in the jet .",
    "the observed patterns are also influenced by the travel path of the emitted radiation towards the observer since faraday rotation and , most importantly , opacity modulate total intensity and polarization radio maps . finally , there are other effects that can be very important for shaping vlbi observations which do not unambiguously depend on the hydrodynamic jet structure , namely , radiative losses , particle acceleration at shocks , pair formation , etc . in this work",
    "we try to account for some of these elements by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the basis for currently accepted interpretation of the phenomenology of relativistic jets was set by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a number of analytic works have settled the basic understanding that accounts for the non - thermal synchrotron and inverse compton emission of extragalactic jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as the spectral evolution of superluminal components in parsec - scale jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "assuming kinematic jet models , the numerical implementation of these analytic results enables one to extensively test the most critical theoretical assumptions by comparison with the observed phenomenology both for steady ( e.g. , @xcite ) and unsteady jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "basically , the aforementioned numerical implementation consists on integrating the synchrotron transfer equations assuming that radiation originated from an idealized jet model and accounting for all the effects mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "the advent of multidimensional relativistic ( magneto-)hydrodynamic numerical codes has allowed to replace the previously used kinematic , steady jet models by multidimensional , time - dependent hydrodynamic models of thermal plasmas ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the works of @xcite , ( hereafter g95 and g97 , respectively ) @xcite or @xcite compute the synchrotron emission of relativistic hydrodynamic jet models with suitable algorithms that account for a number of relativistic effects ( e.g. , doppler boosting , light aberration , time delays , etc . ) .",
    "their models assume that there exists a proportionality between the number and the energy density of the hydrodynamic ( thermal ) plasma and the corresponding number and energy density of the emitting population of non - thermal or supra - thermal particles .",
    "these authors assumed that the magnetic field was dynamically negligible , that the emitted radiation had no back - reaction on the dynamics , and that that synchrotron losses were negligible .",
    "all these assumptions are very reasonable for vlbi jets at radio observing frequencies if the jet magnetic field is sufficiently weak .",
    "consistent with their assumptions , the former papers included neither a consistent spectral evolution of the non - thermal particle ( ntp ) population , nor the proper particle and energy transport along the jet .",
    "the spectral evolution of ntps and its transport in classical jets and radiogalaxies have been carried out by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in these",
    "works a coupled evolution of a non - relativistic plasma along with a population of ntps has been used to asses either the signatures of diffusive shock acceleration in radio galaxies @xcite or the observational imprint of the non - linear saturation of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) modes developed by a perturbed beam @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also developed a scheme to perform multidimensional newtonian magneto - hydrodynamical simulations coupled with stochastic differential equations adapted to test particle acceleration and transport in kilo - parsec scale jets .",
    "dealing with the spectral evolution of ntps is relevant in view of the multiband observations of extragalactic jets where , a significant aging of the emitting particles seems to be present at optical to x - ray frequencies ( m87 , @xcite ; cen  a , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper builds upon the lines opened by g95 and g97 .",
    "g95 concentrated on the emission properties from steady relativistic jets , focusing on the role played by the external medium in determining the jet opening angle and presence of standing shocks .",
    "g97 used a similar numerical procedure to study the ejection , structure , and evolution of superluminal components through variations in the ejection velocity at the jet inlet .",
    "@xcite discussed in detail how a single hydrodynamic perturbation triggers pinch body modes in a relativistic , axisymmetric beam which result in observable superluminal features trailing the main superluminal component .",
    "finally , @xcite extended the work of @xcite to three - dimensional , helically perturbed beams . here",
    ", we combine multidimensional relativistic models of compact jets with a new algorithm to compute the spectral evolution of supra - thermal particles evolving in its bosom , i.e. , including their radiative losses , and their relevance for the emission and the spectral study of relativistic jets .",
    "this work is composed of two parts . in the first part , we present a new numerical scheme to evolve populations of relativistic electrons in relativistic hydrodynamical flows including radiative losses (   [ sec : spev ] ) .",
    "for the purpose of calibration the new method , our work is based upon the same axisymmetric , relativistic , hydrodynamic jet models as employed in g97 .",
    "using the same jet parameters allows us to quantify the relevance of including radiative losses and , along the way , to compare the emission properties of parsec - scale jets computed according to two different methods : ( 1 ) the new method presented in this paper and ( 2 ) the method presented in g95 and g97 , to which we will refer , for simplicity , as _ adiabatic method _ ( am ) .",
    "in the second part of the paper , we apply the new method to quantify the relevance of radiative losses in the evolution of both quiescent and dynamical jet models . we will show (   [ sec : radio ] ) the regimes in which both approaches yield similar synthetic total intensity radio maps and when synchrotron losses modify substantially the results .",
    "we also show which are the key parameters to trigger a substantial ntp aging and , therefore , to significantly change the appearance of the radio maps corresponding to the same underlying , quiescent jet models .",
    "the spectral evolution of a hydrodynamic perturbation travelling downstream the jet , will be discussed in sect .",

    "the opening angles for the models pm and op are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "pressure equilibrium in the atmosphere is ensured by including adequate counter - balancing , numerical source terms . however , despite the fact that the initial model is very close to equilibrium , small numerical imbalance of forces triggers a transient evolution that decays into a final quasi - steady state after roughly @xmath25 longitudinal grid light - crossing times .",
    "we treat these quiescent states as initial models .",
    "model pm yields an adiabatically - expanding , smooth beam .",
    "model op develops a collection of cross shocks in the beam , whose spacing increases with the distance from the jet basis .",
    "variations in the injection velocity ( lorentz factor ) have been suggested as a way to generate internal shocks in relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "we set up a traveling perturbation in the jet as a sudden increase of the lorentz factor at the jet nozzle ( from @xmath14 to @xmath26 ) for a short period of time ( @xmath27 ; @xmath28 being the light speed ) .",
    "since the injected perturbation is the same as in g97 , its evolution is identical to the one these authors showed and , thus , we provide a brief overview here .",
    "the perturbation develops two riemann fans emerging from its leading and rear edges ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in front of the perturbation a shock - contact discontinuity - shock structure ( @xmath29 ) forms , while the rear edge is trailed by a rarefaction - contact discontinuity - rarefaction ( @xmath30 ) fan . in the leading shocked region",
    "the beam expands radially owed to the pressure increase with respect to the atmosphere . in the trailing rarefied volume",
    "the beam shrinks radially on account of the smaller pressure in the beam than in the external medium .",
    "this excites the generation of pinch body modes in the beam that seem to trail the main hydrodynamic perturbation as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "also the component itself splits in , at least , two parts when the forward moving rarefaction leaving the rear edge of the component merges with the reverse shock traveling backwards ( in the component rest frame ) that leaves from the forward edge of the hydrodynamic perturbation ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "the _ sp_ectral _ ev_olution ( spev ) routines are a set of methods developed to follow the evolution of ntps in the phase space . here",
    "we assume that the radiative losses at radio frequencies are negligible with respect to the total thermal energy of the jet at every point in the jet .",
    "thus , radiation back reaction onto the hydrodynamic evolution is neglected .",
    "certainly , such an _ ansatz _ is invalid at shorter wavelengths ( optical , x - rays ) , where radiative losses shape the observed spectra ( see , e.g. , @xcite for x - ray - synchrotron blazar models that include the radiation back - reaction onto the component dynamics ) .    the 7-dimensional space formed by the particle momenta , particle positions and time is split into two parts .",
    "for the spatial part of the phase space , we assume that ntps do not diffuse in the hydrodynamic ( thermal ) plasma .",
    "thereby , the spatial evolution of the ntps is governed by the velocity field of the underlying fluid , and it implies that the ntp comoving frame is the same as the thermal fluid comoving frame . assuming a negligible diffusion of ntps is a sound approximation in most parts of our hydrodynamic models since the electron diffusion lengths are much smaller than the dynamical lengths in smooth flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , the assumption is not fulfilled wherever diffusive acceleration of ntps takes place ( e.g. , at shocks or at the jet lateral boundaries ) .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a strong mismatch between the scales relevant to dynamical and diffusive transport processes for ntps of relevance to synchrotron radio - to - x - ray emissions within relativistic jets .",
    "the mismatch ensures that even in macroscopic , non - smooth regions such as the cross shocks in the beam of model op , the assumption we have made suffices to provide a good qualitative description of the ntp population dynamics .",
    "consistent with the hydrodynamic discretization , we assume that the velocity field is uniform inside each numerical cell ( equal to the average of the velocity inside such cell ) . in practice , a number of lagrangian _ particles _ are introduced through the jet nozzle , each evolving the same ntp distribution but being spatially transported according to the local fluid conditions .",
    "we emphasize that these lagrangian particles are used here for the solely purpose of representing the spatial evolution ( i.e. , the trajectories ) of ensembles of ntps .",
    "we integrate the trajectories of such particles using a conventional time - explicit , adaptive - step - size , fourth order runge - kutta ( rk ) integrator .      in order to derive the equations governing the time evolution of charged ntps in the momentum space we follow closely the approach of @xcite ( see also @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "we start by considering the boltzmann equation that obeys the ensemble averaged distribution function @xmath31 of the ntps , each with a rest - mass @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath31 is a function of the coordinates @xmath34 and the components of the particle 4-momentum @xmath35 with respect to the coordinate basis @xmath36 .",

    "equation  [ eq : boltzman ] can be written in terms of the particle 4-momentum components with respect to the comoving or matter frame instead of the components with respect to the coordinate basis .",
    "the comoving tetrad @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , is formed by four vectors , one of which ( @xmath41 ) is the four velocity of the matter and the following orthonormality relation is fulfilled @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the minkowski metric ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we explicitly point out that the components of tensor quantities with respect to the coordinate and tetrad basis are annotated with greek and latin indices , respectively .",
    "the transformation between the basis @xmath36 and @xmath39 is given by the matrix @xmath45 and its inverse matrix @xmath46 , @xmath47    in terms of the comoving basis , the boltzmann equation is @xmath48 the connection coefficients in the tetrad frame @xmath49 obey the following relations @xmath50 where the comma and the semicolon stand for partial and covariant derivatives , respectively .",
    "we introduce the two first moments of the distribution function by the equations @xmath51 @xmath52 where p@xmath53 is the square of the ntp three - momentum measured by the comoving observer .",
    "the solid - angle ( @xmath54 ) integrations are performed over all particle momentum directions .",
    "the number of ntps per unit volume with modulus of their three - momentum between p and p+@xmath55 for an observer comoving with the matter is @xmath56 .",
    "further integration of the above moments @xmath57 and @xmath58 over p , @xmath59 , gives the hydrodynamical moments .    in order to obtain the continuity equation for ntps , we multiply the boltzmann equation  ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) by @xmath60 , and integrate over @xmath54 to yield ( for the details see app .",
    "a of @xcite ) ,    @xmath61    the next step is to formulate the continuity equation in the diffusion approximation .",
    "such approximation implies that the scattering of ntps by hydromagnetic turbulence results in a quasi isotropic distribution function in the scattering ( comoving ) frame .",
    "thus , it is assumed that the distribution function of the ntps can be expressed as the sum of two terms , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the unit vector in the direction of the momentum of the particle .",

    "indeed , the overall agreement between both methods in the predicted quiescent radio maps is remarkably good , particularly , if we consider the fact that spev is a lagrangian method while am is eulerian .    looking at the synthetic radio maps of model op - l - nl ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fiduc - emiss ] ) , we observe , as in g97 , a regular pattern of knots of high emission , associated with the increased specific internal energy and rest - mass density of internal oblique shocks produced by the initial overpressure in this model .",

    "[ fig : fiduc_distrib ] ) only changes by a factor of 2 along the whole jet length . theoretically , it is well understood that it is possible to undergo a substantial spectral evolution ( triggered by synchrotron losses ) and , simultaneously , not to have any manifestation of such evolution at radio frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the substantial decrease of @xmath132 triggered by the radiative losses , does not affect much the value of the integral that has to be performed over @xmath93 in order to compute the emissivity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : j(nu ) ] ) , since most of the emitted power at radio - frequencies happens relatively close to @xmath2 , where synchrotron losses are negligible .",
    "certainly , at higher observing frequencies this is not the case , and the emissivity substantially drops because of the fact that both , the synchrotron losses ( eq .  [ eq : dpdt_syn ] ) and the frequency at which the spectral maximum emission is reached depend on the square of the non - thermal electron energy ( and on the magnetic field strength ) .",
    "we define the spectral index between two radio frequencies as @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 are the flux densities at the frequencies @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively .",

    "furthermore , we may compute @xmath209 for both _ convolved _ or _ unconvolved _ flux densities .",
    "the unconvolved flux density is directly obtained from the simulations and has an extremely good spatial resolution , viz .",
    "the unconvolved radio images have a resolution comparable to that of the hydrodynamic data .",
    "the convolved flux densities result from the convolution with a circular gaussian beam of the unconvolved data .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian beam is proportional to the observing wavelength .",
    "this convolution is necessary to degrade the resolution of our models down to limits comparable with typical vlbi observing resolution .",
    "we note that in order to compute the spectral index for convolved flux densities , we have to employ the same fwhm convolution kernel for the data at the two frequencies under consideration .",

    "we verify that , at large distances to the jet nozzle , unconvolved models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thick_axis ] upper panels ) tend to reach the expected value @xmath211 for an optically thin source .",
    "this asymptotic value is reached smoothly in case of the pm - l and pm - h models and it is modulated by the presence of inhomogeneities ( recollimation shocks ) in the beam of models op - l and op - h .    close to the jet nozzle , our unconvolved models display flat or even inverted ( @xmath212 ) spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thick_axis ] ) , in spite of the fact that the jets are optically thin throughout their whole volume .",

    "the spectral inversion in the op - l model happens where standing features ( associated to recollimation shocks in the beam ) are seen in the jet .",
    "if synchrotron losses are not included , the spectral behavior of models pm - l and op - l remains unchanged , because in such a case loses are negligible .",
    "however , if for the models pm - h and op - h the losses are not accounted for ( which is , obviously , a wrong assumption ) , the jet displays an inverted spectrum up to distances @xmath216 .",
    "the behavior of the spectral index exhibited by our models close to the jet nozzle contrasts with the theoretical expectations for an inhomogeneous , optically thin jet with a negative electron spectral index , for which the jet inhomogeneity is predicted to steepen the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to explain this discrepancy we argue that the analytic predictions are based on the assumption that the limits of the energy distribution of the ntps safely yield that the contribution of the synchrotron functions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : f(x ) ] and [ eq : r(x ) ] ) to the synchrotron coefficients ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : j(nu ) ] and [ eq : kappa(nu ) ] ) is proportional to some power of the frequency and of the ntp s lorentz factor .",

[ eq : r(x ) ] ) reaches its maximum , where @xmath220 , and @xmath221 is the smallest observing frequency in the comoving frame . since the function @xmath177 has a maximum for @xmath222 , one finds that the condition to have an inverted spectrum is @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the doppler factor .",
    "since , in our case , @xmath225ghz , we may also write @xmath226 figure  [ fig : boundary_effects ] shows how this boundary effect substantially modifies the emissivity at 15ghz and 43ghz for the model pm - l . at the injection nozzle ( fig .",

    "( [ eq : j(nu ) ] ) is set by @xmath2 and not by the lower limit of @xmath227 .",
    "however , downstream the jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary_effects ] lower panel ) the situation reverses and the fast decay of @xmath227 for @xmath228 sets the lower limit of the emissivity integral .",
    "thus , close to the nozzle , the value of the area below the @xmath229 curve , which is proportional to the emissivity at 43ghz , is larger than that below the curve @xmath230 .",
    "hence , there is an emissivity excess at 43ghz compared to that at 15ghz . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath209 becomes positive close to the jet nozzle .",
    "far away from the nozzle the emissivity at 15ghz almost doubles that at 43ghz , explaining why values of @xmath231 are reached asymptotically .",
    "the convolved models display some traces of the behavior shown for the uncovolved ones .",
    "for example , op models display a flat or inverted spectrum very close to the jet nozzle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thick_axis_conv ] right panels ) .",
    "this is not the case for pm - l model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thick_axis_conv ] ) .",
    "since the resolution of the convolved data is much poorer than that of the unconvolved one , @xmath209 exhibits a quasi monotonically decreasing profile from the jet nozzle ( where @xmath232 ) .",
    "the coarse resolution of the convolved data also blurs any signature in the spectral index associated to the existence of cross shocks in the beam of op models .",
    "furthermore , the decay with distance of the spectral index is shallower for the convolved flux data than for the unconvolved one .",
    "hence , the theoretical value @xmath233 , which is expected for an optically thin synchrotron source , is reached nowhere in the jet models pm - l and op - l ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thick_axis_conv ] ) .    as expected , at frequencies below a few hundred mhz ,",
    "the jet is strongly self - absorbed everywhere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec - axis ] ) .",
    "close to the jet nozzle , there is not a clear turnover frequency between the self - absorbed part of the spectrum and the optically thin one .",
    "instead , we observe a smooth transition between both regimes .",
    "far from the nozzle , the self - absorption turnover is much more peaked .",
    "it is known @xcite that in contrast with a distribution of ntp that follows a power - law extending to @xmath234 , if the power - law is restricted to a relatively large , but not unrealistic @xmath2 , or if the electron distribution was monoenergetic , the intensity can be flat over nearly two decades in frequency ( which implies that the energy flux grows linearly over the same frequency range ) .",
    "our pm - l models have @xmath235 at the injection nozzle and reduce it to @xmath236 at @xmath237 because of the adiabatic expansion of the jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fiduc_distrib ] upper left ) . as we have argued in ",
    "[ sec : radio ] close to the jet nozzle , @xmath238 , which means that @xmath2 is sufficiently large to be in the range where a smooth turnover transition is expected , in agreement with @xcite . far away from the nozzle , since @xmath2 decreases , we recover the more standard situation in which an obvious turnover frequency can be identified .",
    "provided that close to the nozzle our pm ( also op ) models are weakly self - absorbed ( at 15ghz , the solid black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec - axis ] has not reached the power - law regime yet ) , one may question whether the spectral inversion we have found is not also the result of opacity effects .",
    "we have dismissed such a possibility by running models with the spev method including no absorption .      in order to study the effect of intense synchrotron losses we consider models pm - h and op - h ( figs .",
    "[ fig : highb - emiss ] and [ fig : high - b ] ) .",
    "very close to the injection nozzle ( @xmath239 ) the line denoting the evolution of @xmath240 crosses the line corresponding to a 10% synchrotron efficiency limit ( lower blue thick line ; fig .",
    "[ fig : high - b ] ) and most of the synchrotron emissivity falls outside of the observational frequency . because of a stronger magnetic field than in models pm - l and op - l , more energy is lost close to the jet nozzle than far from it and , thus , spev - radio - maps look much shorter than spev - nl - radio - maps ( fig .  [",
    "fig : highb - emiss ] ) .",
    "an alternative way to see such an effect is through the rapid decay of @xmath241 in the first @xmath242 in fig .",
    "[ fig : high - b ] , right panel .",
    "afterwards , the adiabatic changes dominate the ntp evolution .",
    "the initial period of fast evolution is even shorter if a larger magnetic field were to be considered .",
    "the intensity contrast between shocked and unshocked jet regions of model op - h ( fig .  [ fig : high - b ] ) is larger than that of model op - h - nl .",
    "indeed , the op - h model appears as a discontinuous jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : highb - emiss ] ) because of the slightly larger intensity increase than in the op - h - nl model when the ntp distribution passes through cross - shocks and the much more pronounced intensity decrease at rarefactions .",
    "we note that , although the adiabatic evolution is followed with the same algorithm in spev and spev - nl , the radiative losses change substantially the ntp distribution that it is injected through the nozzle after very short distances .",
    "the consequence being that the ntp distribution @xmath181 that faces shocks and rarefactions downstream the nozzle is rather different when using spev or spev - nl method and , therefore , the relative intensity of shocked and unshocked regions is also different depending on whether synchrotron losses are included or not in the calculation .",
    "the outlined differences between models op - h and op - h - nl ( with shocks in the beam ) , have to be interpreted with caution since none of the methods accounts for the injection of high - energy particles at shocks . but independent of this , we expect that if the magnetic field is sufficiently large , the spev method will yield a rather fast evolution of such particles and , thereby , a faster decay of the intensity downstream the shock .    the most relevant difference between the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : highb - emiss ] , is the increased brightness of the jet close to the injection nozzle and the steeper fading of the jet when energy losses are included .",
    "this fact poses the paradox that the method that accounts for radiative losses ( spev ) yields brighter standing features close to the injection nozzle ( far from the nozzle the situation reverses and the spev - nl model is brighter than spev one ) . in order to disentangle this apparent contradiction",
    ", we shall consider that the plasma is compressed at standing shocks , which yields a growth of the magnetic field energy density ( proportional to the pressure in our case ) , and triggers a faster cooling of the high - energy particles . since the spev method conserves the number density of ntps ( eq .  [ eq : n ] ) , due to the synchrotron losses",
    ", high - energy particles reduce their energy and accumulate into an interval of lorentz factor which is smaller than in the case of spev - nl models . as in such reduced lorentz factor interval ntps",
    "radiate more efficiently at the considered radio - frequencies , the emissivity of spev models at strong compressions ( like , e.g. , the considered cross shocks ) becomes larger than that corresponding to models which do not include synchrotron losses .",
    "it is important to note that this situation happens in our models rather close to the jet nozzle .",

    "the remaining trailing components move much faster and they can probably be due to the pattern motion of kh modes in the op beam .    comparing the traces left by the passage of the main hydrodynamic perturbation in the pm and op models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pmop - sptm ] ) , it turns out that the signatures of such perturbation are much cleaner and numerous in pm than in op models .",
    "the number of trailing components is smaller in op than in pm models , and their world - lines are more oscillatory than in the latter case . for a lager magnetic field ( models pm - h and op - h ; fig .",

    "the unconvolved data for both pm and op models , and independently of the magnetic field strength , is compatible with not having any time lag between the high and low frequency radiation emitted by the main component , i.e. , the radiation at all three frequencies is co - spatial ( fig .",

    "however , the convolved data display a number of positive and negative time lags which result from the difference in the size of the convolution beam at every frequency . in case of the pm models ,",

    "[ fig : pmop - sptm - traj - conv ] upper panels ) .",
    "thereby , the low energy radiation from the main component is seen first , and later an observer detects radiation at higher frequencies .",
    "nevertheless , considering that the resolution of the convolved data is worse at smaller frequencies , the emission from the component is consistent with having no time - lags between low and high frequency emission .",

    "indeed , quiescent jet models including radiative losses are more knotty than those models which do not include them .",
    "these features result from the conservation of the number density of ntps . since the same number of particles per unit of volume that initially extends from @xmath275 to a certain upper limit @xmath276 is confined into a narrower lorentz factor interval , wherein more ntps are efficiently emitting in the considered observational radio bands . in the adiabatic regime (",
    "reached relatively far away from the jet nozzle ) , the spectral changes , that the ntp population experiences as it is advected downstream the jet , of models with and without losses is qualitatively similar , since most of the high - energy ntps ( which evolve faster ) have cooled down to energies where losses are negligible .",
    "the beam of the jet in the adiabatic regime is dimmer at radio - frequencies than in models where synchrotron losses are not included .",
    "our method lacks of a suitable scheme to account for diffusive shock acceleration of ntps .",
    "however , all shocks existing in the quiescent jet models are rather weak and , for practical purposes they can be considered as compressions in the flow , where an enhanced emission is obtained due to the local increase of density and of pressure .",
    "one of the main results of this work is that for the same background hydrodynamic jet model , dynamically negligible magnetic fields of different strengths yield substantially different observed morphologies . this introduces a new source of degeneracy ( in addition to relativistic effects , such as , time delay , aberration , etc . ) when inferring physical parameters out of observations of radio jets .",
    "for example , the difference in the observational properties of models op - l and op - h ( sect .

    "observationally , it could be possible to discriminate between both possibilities by looking at the high - energy spectrum of the source .",
    "if there are external seed photons ( e.g. , from the agn ) , which were compton up - scattered by the non - thermal electrons of the jet , the spectral index at high energies could discriminate between the alternative explanations for the optically - thin inverted spectra at radio frequencies .    since @xmath2 is fixed in our model through eq .",

    "we denote the jet viewing angle by @xmath292 , and choose the following observer coordinate system ( rotated with respect to the 3d cartesian system by an angle @xmath292 around the @xmath293-axis ) @xmath294 in which the observer is located along the @xmath295 axis , far from the jet . for a given elapsed simulation time @xmath296 in the jet frame the time of observation @xmath297 is defined as @xmath298",
    "the task of the imaging algorithm is to produce image in the @xmath299 plane for a fixed arrival time @xmath297 ( note that the image will be symmetric with respect to the @xmath300-axis if the magnetic field is completely random ) . from eqs .",
    "[ eq:3dobs ]  -  [ eq : tobs ] it is clear that we need to have information about states of the jet at multiple instants of laboratory frame time in order to correctly compute the contribution at a single @xmath297 . in a numerical hydrodynamic simulation",

[ sec : spev ] ) .",
    "however , for the purposes of imaging , a three - dimensional particle distribution needs to be created .",
    "we assume that each particle which is injected at the jet nozzle has a radius @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is the beam radius and @xmath307 number of particles per beam radius .",
    "that means that a particle in two dimensions correspond to a revolution annulus in the @xmath308 coordinate system . in principle , by knowing the particle position @xmath309 in the 2d grid we could compute from eqs .",
    "[ eq:3dobs ]  -  [ eq : tobs ] all combinations of @xmath308 and , hence , all combinations @xmath300 , @xmath310 and @xmath297 to which the particle annulus corresponds for a fixed @xmath296 . in practice , we approximate every annulus by a series of cubes which are distributed along a circle with radius @xmath311 , whose center is in @xmath312 .",
    "the number of cubes , evenly distributed in the azimuthal direction , necessary for an optimal volume coverage of the annulus depends on the relation between @xmath311 and the particle radius @xmath313 ( see next subsection ) . by virtue of the symmetry of the jet , as seen by the observer , with respect to the @xmath314-axis , we only need to compute the contribution from one half - annulus , i.e. for those cubes where @xmath315 .",
    "we assume that both the emissivity and the absorption coefficient are homogeneous within each cube .",

    "@xmath322 is reset to @xmath323 and the volume for which @xmath324 is always @xmath325 , which is close to the average over all possible values @xmath326 of the true volume @xmath327 .      to compute an image we subdivide the @xmath328 plane into rectangular pixels , and compute the contributions to each pixel by checking which particle cube intersects which pixel at the right observation time .",
    "the ratio of the area of intersection to the pixel area , gives a `` weight '' of the contribution of a particular cube to the intensity of the pixel .",
    "for a given @xmath296 , the value of @xmath295 for each particle gives the distance from the observer , so that we create a `` line - of - sight '' ( los ) for each pixel and sort along this line all contributing particles according to @xmath295 ( note that these contributions generally come from different instants of the laboratory frame time @xmath296 ) .",
    "since in every pixel we sum up the contributions spanning the observer time range @xmath329 $ ] , the intersections of every los with particle cubes are segments , not points ( which would be the case if in every pixel we would only consider the instantaneous contributions at @xmath297 ) .",
    "after all the contributions ( i.e. , intersection segments ) to a pixel have been accounted for , we solve the standard radiative transfer equation to evaluate the final pixel intensity .",
    "the above procedure can be performed simultaneously for a number of different values of @xmath297 , so that a `` movie '' in the observer frame can be created . in order to transform the intensity detected in a pixel into a flux",
    "we need to multiply by the pixel area .      in order to validate our imaging algorithm",
    "we have developed two tests which are based upon the idea that , increasing the number of lagrangian particles , both the volume filling factor and the total detected flux should converge .",
    "we first show the convergence of the volume filling method .",
    "then we show that the images and the total flux of the quiescent pm - l and op - l models converge with increasing number of particle families .",
    "we have created a toy model consisting of a cylindrical _ jet _ with uniform velocity parallel to the jet axis , and with a length equal to the particle size @xmath313 .",
    "the half - volume of such jet is @xmath330 .",
    "we inject @xmath307 particles in the jet evenly distributed across the jet radius ( i.e. , @xmath331 , or @xmath332 , @xmath333 ) .",
    "if particles do not overlap , the volume filling factor is @xmath334    since we have a finite number of particles , the jet volume is only partially patched by the volume occupied by such lagrangian particles , i.e. , the volume filling factor is smaller than one .",
    "increasing the number of particles brings it closer to one . to test the volume filling method",
    ", we produce an `` image '' of the jet at an observer time @xmath335 with a @xmath336 viewing angle , accumulating in each pixel the contributions corresponding to a laboratory frame time interval @xmath337 .",
    "however , instead of summing up the emissivity , we add up the length of the intersection of each particle s volume with each pixel in the @xmath299 plane ( as described above ) .",
    "the idea behind the substitution of the emissivity by the intersection length is that , at @xmath336 the intersection length and the intersection volume of the particles are proportional and , thus , measuring lengths or volumes is equivalent .",
    "since we accumulate in every pixel all contributions in the range @xmath338 $ ] , the intersection length with each particle equals the size of the particle perpendicular to the los ( @xmath339 ) .",
    "hence , the value accumulated in a pixel @xmath340 , namely @xmath341 , is @xmath342 where @xmath343 and @xmath344 are the area of intersection of a particle with a pixel and the pixel area , respectively . the sum in eq .",

    "in the limit @xmath346 ( equivalently , @xmath347 ) @xmath348 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of particles intersected by the los departing from @xmath345 and having a cross sectional area @xmath344 is @xmath349 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath350 equation  [ eq : lpx2 ] simply expresses that , in the limit @xmath351 , the length measured in the pixel @xmath345 should tend to the length of the chord determined by the intersection of the jet body with the line of sight from @xmath345 .",
    "figure  [ fig : circle]a shows that for @xmath352 the results converge very rapidly to the analytic expectation ( thick black line ) .      to test the convergence of the imaging algorithm we have produced images of quiescent pm - l and op - l models with varying @xmath353 .",
    "the total number of particles in the grid grows as @xmath354 , it is thus important to minimize the number of particle families for numerical purposes . on fig .",
    "[ fig : circle]b we show the total image flux at @xmath355ghz for pm - l and op - l models as a function of @xmath307 .",
    "the values are normalized to the flux of the model with the largest number of injected particles per beam radius ( @xmath356 ) , which we consider the reference value .",
    "this test is important because the total flux represents a global value of every model , since it is computed by summing up the individual fluxes arriving to each pixel in the detector , and multiplying by the corresponding pixel area .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath357 the flux does not deviate more than @xmath358 form the reference value .",
    "thus , any model with @xmath357 has sufficiently converged to an appropriate total flux .",
    "this has motivated our choice to work with @xmath359 in the current paper , since it yields an optimal trade - off between numerical accuracy and computational cost .",
