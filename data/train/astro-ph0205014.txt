    "much of current astrobiological research is focused on learning more about the early evolution of the earth and about the origin of life .",
    "we may be able to extrapolate and generalize our knowledge of how life formed here to how it might have formed elsewhere .",
    "indirect evidence suggesting that life may be common in the universe includes :    * sun - like stars are common . * formation of earth - like planets in habitable zones around these stars may be a common feature of star formation ( kasting et al .",
    "1993 , wetherill 1996 , lissauer and lin 2000 , lineweaver 2001 ) . * life s chemical ingredients  water , amino acids and other organic molecules  are common ( cronin 1989 , trimble 1997 , charnley et al .",
    "* sources of free energy such as starlight and reduction - oxidation pairs are common ( nealson and conrad 1999 ) .",
    "it is difficult to translate this circumstantial evidence into an estimate of how common life is in the universe . without definitive detections of extraterrestrial life",
    "we can say very little about how common it is or even whether it exists .",
    "our existence on earth can tell us little about how common life is in the universe or about the probability of biogenesis on a terrestrial planet because , even if this probability were infinitesimally small and there were only one life - harboring planet in the universe we would , of necessity , find ourselves on that planet .",
    "however , the rapidity with which life appeared on earth gives us more information .",
    "if life were rare it would be unlikely that biogenesis would occur as rapidly as it seems to have occurred on earth .",
    "although we do not understand the details of how life originated , we have some useful observational constraints on how long it took .",
    "carbon isotopic evidence suggests that life existed on earth more than @xmath3 billion years ago ( mojzsis et al .",
    "high temperatures and large frequent sterilizing impacts may have frustrated an earlier appearance of life ( maher and stevenson 1988 , sleep et al .",
    "if life originated on earth , then increasingly tight observational constraints indicate that biogenesis was rapid ( oberbeck and fogleman 1989 , sleep et al .",
    "the extraterrestrial implications of rapid biogenesis on earth and the extent to which this rapidity suggests that life is common in the universe have not been looked at carefully and are the focus of this paper .",
    "the basic concept is simple ; over a given time period , more probable events happen more often ( and thus more rapidly ) than less probable events .",
    "thus , the probability of winning a lottery can be inferred from how quickly a lottery winner has won .",
    "for example , suppose we have no idea about the probability @xmath4 , of winning a daily lottery ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "suppose a gambler buys a lottery ticket every day for three days , losing on the first two days and winning on the third .",
    "we can use this information to infer something about @xmath4 . specifically , in this case , we can say that @xmath4 is more likely to be about one third than one hundredth , and is unlikely to be close to 1 ( see @xmath6 in fig .",
    "if the gambler can only tell us that he won at least once within 3 days then we can no longer exclude high values of @xmath4 with such confidence , but the likelihood of @xmath4 can still tell us that @xmath7 at the @xmath2 confidence level ( see @xmath8 in fig . 1 and eq . [ eq : a2 ] of appendix ) .",
    "suppose there is a group of gamblers , all of whom have won at least once within @xmath9 ( e.g. @xmath10 ) days .",
    "a gambler is choosen from this group at random and after carefully examining his tickets , he tells us that he won at least once within the first 3 days  relatively early in the 12 days that he had to have won by , to be in the group .",
    "this is analogous to our situation on earth .",
    "we find ourselves in the group of planets on which biogenesis has necessarily occurred  we have of necessity won the biogenetic lottery some time in the past .",
    "and we also find that biogenesis has occurred rapidly .",
    "we won soon after life became possible on earth .",
    "given the above information about the gambler , the likelihood of @xmath4 is plotted in fig .",
    "1 as @xmath11 and allows us to conclude that @xmath12 at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "this statistical result applies to a group of gamblers or to a group of terrestrial planets on which the probability @xmath4 of biogenesis is unknown , as long as @xmath4 is approximately the same for each planet in the group and approximately the same as it was on earth . in the next section we review the observational constraints on when and how quickly life appeared on earth . in section [ sec : caveats ] we use these constraints to identify and critically examine selection effects that complicate this result . in section [ sec : drake ]",
    "we discuss the relationship between our result , the drake equation , and the larger question : ` how common is life in the universe ? '",
    "mathematical details are relegated to the appendix .",
    "if life originated on earth , then during and immediately following the earth s formation there was a period without life ( @xmath13 ) , followed by a period during which life evolved ( @xmath14 ) , followed by a period during which life has been present ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the sum of these intervals adds up to the age of the earth ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : + + = [ eq : simple ] where @xmath16 gyr ( allgre et al . 1995 ) . as older fossils and biosignatures",
    "have been found , @xmath15 has gotten longer .",
    "the significance of large impacts in frustrating or sterilizing proto - life has only recently been appreciated and assessed ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "combined , these observations indicate that biogenesis was rapid since @xmath14 is caught in the middle  the longer @xmath13 and @xmath15 get , the shorter @xmath14 must get .",
    "the distinction between how rapid biogenesis was and when it was , is important because our result , the inferred probability of biogenesis , depends on how rapid it was , while only a marginal selection effect depends on when it was ( section [ sec : caveats ] ) .",
    "the majority of the earth s mass accreted from planetesimals within the first 100 million years of the earth s formation ( halliday 2000 ) . with an initially molten surface , life could not have appeared .",
    "the transition from accretion to heavy bombardment included the formation of the moon by the collision with a mars - sized object @xmath17 gyr ago ( hartmann and davis 1975 , halliday 2001 , canup and asphaug 2001 ) .",
    "we can infer from the dates and sizes of lunar impact crators , whose record goes back to when the moon formed a solid crust ( @xmath18 gyr ago , sleep et al .",
    "1989 ) that the surface of the earth was periodically vaporized .",
    "since the mass of the earth is 80 times the mass of the moon , impacts on the earth were more numerous , more energetic and periodically produced 2,000 k rock vapor atmospheres which lasted for several thousand years ( hartmann et al .",
    "2000 , sleep et al .",
    "these conditions were probably an effective and recurring autoclave for sterilizing the earliest life forms or more generally frustrating the evolution of life .",
    "a steadily decreasing heavy bombardment continued until @xmath19 gyr ago .",
    "estimates of the time of the most recent sterilizing impact range between @xmath20 and @xmath21 gyr ago ( maher and stevenson 1988 , sleep et al .",
    "1989 , oberbeck and fogleman 1989 , halliday 2001 ) .",
    "these estimates span the time from the solidification of the moon s crust to the end of the late heavy bombardment .",
    "thus , life was frustrated for at least the first 0.1 gyr and possibly as long as the first 0.9 gyr of the earth s existence .",
    "we take our preferred value as the middle of this range : @xmath22 gyr .",
    "the range of these estimates reflects the large uncertainties due to small number statistics for the largest impactors and the uncertainty of the energy required to sterilize the earth completely .",
    "we do not know where biogenesis happened or the extent to which it was protected from the effects of impacts .",
    "tidal pools have little protection , hydrothermal vents have some protection , while autotrophic thermophiles in sub - surface rock under several kilometers of crust were probably in effective bomb shelters .    the roots of the universal tree of life point to a thermophilic origin ( or at least a thermophilic common ancestor ) for all life on earth ( pace 1991 , stetter 1996 ) .",
    "this suggests a hot biogenesis in hydrothermal vents or possibly sub - surface rock and/or selection for thermophilia by periodic temperature pulses from large impacts .",
    "@xmath23 we knew that life evolved on the surface of the earth and was therefore more susceptible to impact sterilizations , life would have been frustrated longer and our preferred value would be more precise : @xmath24 gyr .    if we accept the carbon isotopic evidence for life more than @xmath3 billion years ago ( mojzsis et al .",
    "1996 ) then life has been on earth * at least * that long , i.e. , @xmath15 is at least @xmath3 gyr . in addition , because of the earth s tectonic history , this time is also the earliest time we could reasonably hope to find biological evidence from rocks on earth  even if life existed earlier . with this selection effect in mind ( which we know exists at some level ) ,",
    "our preferred value for the time life has existed on earth is : @xmath25 gyr .",
    "it is possible that biogenesis occurred several times on earth .",
    "for example , during the period @xmath13 , life could have evolved and been sterilized multiple times .",
    "we do not know if this happened .",
    "similar potential sterilizations and biogeneses could have occurred during the period @xmath15 but we do not know . for the purposes of this analysis we can ignore this complication .",
    "we are only interested in the shortest period within which the observations can constrain biogenesis to have occurred .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is our best observational constraint on any epoch of biogenesis and this happens to be on the period between the most recent sterilizing impact that is older than the oldest evidence we have for life on earth .",
    "since our preferred values yield @xmath26 , there is little time left for biogenesis to have occurred .",
    "this is the basis for the statement that biogenesis occurred rapidly . substituting our three preferred values , @xmath27 and @xmath28 into eq .",
    "[ eq : simple ] and solving for @xmath14 yields , = 0.1^+0.5_-0.1 thus we take @xmath29 myr as a crude estimate of the upper limit for the time it took life to appear on earth . assuming biogenesis took place on the surface of the earth , oberbeck and fogleman ( 1989 ) found this maximum time to be @xmath30 myr .",
    "maher and stevenson ( 1988 ) assumed that biogenesis took somewhere between @xmath31 myr and @xmath32 myr depending on environment , while sleep et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find a similar range for evolutionarily significant periods of clement surface conditions .",
    "independently , biologists specializing in the chemistry of the origin of life have estimated that the time required for biogenesis is potentially quite short ( miller 1982 ) and could be less than 8 myr ( lazcano and miller 1994 ) .",
    "thus , several lines of evidence indicate that biogenesis was geologically rapid .",
    "if biogenesis occurred in the fissures around a hydrothermal vent or in subsurface rocks , it was well - protected and we can only constrain biogenesis to have taken less than @xmath33 myr .",
    "if biogenesis occurred on the surface , it probably took less than @xmath34 myr . in this analysis",
    "we consider @xmath29 and @xmath35 myr to represent the high and low ends of a plausible range for @xmath14 ( see figs . 2 and 3 respectively ) .",
    "these observational constraints on @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are important because they quantify how rapidly biogenesis occurred on earth and enable us to put limits on the probability that biogenesis occurred on other planets .",
    "for example , consider a group of terrestrial planets with approximately the same probability of biogenesis ` @xmath4 ' as earth .",
    "suppose @xmath36 .",
    "at their formation , none of these planets had life .",
    "as time passed , life arose on more and more of them .",
    "the thick line in fig .",
    "2 shows the increasing percentage of these planets with life as time passes .",
    "after @xmath14 , @xmath37 will have life ( that is how @xmath38 is defined ) .",
    "after @xmath39 gyr , @xmath40 will have life ( @xmath41 still will not ) . of that @xmath40 , @xmath42 will , like the earth , have had biogenesis within @xmath14 .",
    "the histogram on the far right of fig .",
    "2 represents these numbers .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is only @xmath43 .",
    "then only @xmath44 will have life after @xmath39 gyr and only @xmath45 of those will have had biogenesis , like the earth , within @xmath14 . assuming earth is a random member of the planets with life , the single observation that biogenesis occurred within @xmath14 on earth indicates that larger values of @xmath4 are more likely than small values .",
    "this is the basic idea behind our analysis .",
    "it is illustrated in figs . 1 , 4 and 5 which also show quantitative constraints on @xmath4 under the various assumptions discussed in section 3 .    the histograms in figs . 2 and 3 also",
    "show that if @xmath4 is large , the fraction of gamblers or terrestrial planets who have won after a certain time is large .",
    "suppose the gambler did not know how many gamblers had won by the 12th day , but only that he is a random member of the group that had won . from the fact that he won quickly , he can infer that @xmath4 is large .",
    "this tells the gambler that after a few days a large fraction of lottery ticket buyers are in the winners group .",
    "he is not alone . for the biogenesis lottery ,",
    "finding large @xmath4 means that after a few times @xmath14 , a large fraction of the terrestrial planets with probability of biogenesis similar to the earth , have ( or have had ) life .",
    "in section 1 we drew parallels between a daily lottery and a biogenesis lottery .",
    "explicitly , these parallels are :    * the first day of the lottery corresponds to the end of @xmath13 , the time when conditions become clement enough for biogenesis . *",
    "all the gamblers had the same ( but unknown ) chance of winning the lottery each time they bought a ticket ( @xmath4 is the probability of winning per day ) .",
    "this corresponds to a group of terrestrial planets with approximately the same ( but unknown ) chance of biogenesis as the earth ( @xmath4 is the probability of biogenesis within a period of time called here @xmath14 ) . *",
    "we selected a gambler at random from those who had won on or before the @xmath9th day .",
    "thus , we conditioned on winning before a certain time .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that the earth is a random member of the group of terrestrial planets that has had biogenesis on or before the end of @xmath47 .",
    "conditioning on biogenesis before this time corresponds to correcting for the selection effect that biogenesis had to have occurred for us to be here .",
    "* a gambler chosen at random , from the group that has won within @xmath9 days , found that he had won on the first day ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this corresponds to finding that biogenesis has occurred rapidly on earth , that is , within @xmath14 . *",
    "if we set @xmath49 , see fig . 4 ,",
    "@xmath50 , we are conditioning on rapid biogenesis .",
    "we are considering a group , all of whose members have had rapid biogenesis . in this case , a random member having rapid biogenesis can tell us nothing about the probability @xmath4 . to infer something about @xmath4 we must have @xmath51 .",
    "if our conclusions from the daily lottery are to apply to biogenesis on terrestrial planets we need to correct for the fact that the evolution of an observer takes some time .",
    "how long it takes observing equipment , or complex life or multicellular eukaryotes to evolve , is difficult to say . on earth it took @xmath52 gyr . a limited pace of evolution",
    "has prevented us from looking back at our own history and seeing that biogenesis happened last year or even more recently than @xmath53 gyr ago ( we consider a plausible range for the requisite time elapsed since biogenesis to be between 2 and 10 billion years , or @xmath54 gyr ) .",
    "this selection effect for non - recent biogenesis is selecting for biogenesis to happen a few billion years before the present regardless of whether it happened rapidly .",
    "it is not a selection effect for rapid biogenesis since the longer it took us to evolve to a point when we could measure the age of the earth , the older the earth became .",
    "similarly , if biogenesis took @xmath55 gyr longer than it actually did , we would currently find the age of the earth to be @xmath56 gyr ( @xmath57 ) old ; ` why is the earth 4.566 billion years old ? ' , ` because it took that long to find it out . '",
    "the generalization of this plausible assumption to the ensemble of terrestrial planets is necessary if the likelihoods and constraints in figs .",
    "1 , 4 and 5 are to be applicable to the group of terrestrial planets .",
    "any effect that makes rapid biogenesis a prerequisite for life would undermine our inferences for @xmath4 .",
    "for example , although it is usually assumed that the heavy bombardment inhibited biogenesis , energetic impacts may have set up large chemical and thermal disequilibria that play some crucial role in biogenesis .",
    "we know so little about the details of the chemical evolution that led to life that heat pulses and rapid cooling after large impacts may be part of the preconditions for biogenesis .",
    "if true , the timescale of biogenesis would be linked to the timescale of the exponential decay of bombardment and biogenesis would ( if it occurred at all ) be necessarily rapid ; most extant life in the universe would have rapid biogenesis and little could be inferred about the absolute value of @xmath4 from our sample of one .    in a panspermia scenario , the rapid appearance of life on earth is explained not by rapid terrestrial biogenesis as assumed here , but by the ubiquity of the ` seeds of life ' ( e.g. hoyle and wickramasinghe 1999 ) .",
    "an analysis in the context of a panspermia scenario would be subject to the same observational constraints as terrestrial biogenesis and would therefore lead to the same inferred probability for the appearance of life on other terrestrial planets .",
    "another potential problem : suppose the autocatalytic chemical cycles leading to life are exponentially sensitive to some still unknown peculiarity of the initial conditions on earth . in this case , to have the same @xmath4 as the earth , our group of terrestrial planets may have to be almost indistinguishable rare clones of earth .",
    "that is , conditioning on planets identical to earth , ( ` same @xmath4 ' ) would be conditioning on rapid biogenesis ( @xmath49 ) and would prevent us from inferring much about @xmath4 from the observations of rapid biogenesis on earth ( see @xmath50 in fig .",
    "this is an example of the more general issue of the status of the rapidity of biogenesis on earth .",
    "did it have to be rapid ?",
    "if we assume it could have been otherwise then we can infer something about @xmath4 . if it had to be that way , we can not",
    ". the middle ground might be the most plausible option : biogenesis did not necessarily have to happen as rapidly as it did , but ( to be consistent with our existence ) it may have had to happen within one or two billion years of the earth s formation .",
    "if this is true , we need to look carefully at the influence of varying the somewhat arbitrary and counterfactual duration ( @xmath58 ) , that biogenesis _ could _ have taken on earth .",
    "what values of @xmath59 are plausible ? and how do they effect the results ?",
    "this is done in figure 4 which quantifies the degree of variability one can assume for the duration of biogenesis and still have interesting constraints on @xmath4 .",
    "the lower @xmath9 is , the less variability is assumed .",
    "for example , if @xmath60 , see @xmath61 ) , we are assuming that biogenesis could only have taken as long as @xmath62  enough variability to be able to say something about @xmath4 but small enough to maintain the non - observability of recent biogenesis .",
    "figure 5 allows us to generalize our inferences about @xmath4 ( the probability of biogenesis within @xmath14 ) to inferences about @xmath63 ( the probability of biogenesis within an arbitrary time , @xmath59 ) .",
    "specifically , it shows that we only need to be able to assume that biogenesis could have been twice as long as @xmath14 to have interesting constraints : @xmath64 at the @xmath2 confidence level ( see @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is the result reported in the abstract .",
    "the drake equation was devised to address the question of ` how many communicative civilizations are in our galaxy ? ' ( e.g. sagan 1973 ) .",
    "it has been criticized as `` a way of compressing a large amount of ignorance into a small space '' ( oliver , cited in dicke 1998 ) . despite its short - comings , it continues to focus the efforts of the seti community .",
    "an important goal of the seti community is to turn its subjective probabilities into mathematical probabilities .",
    "we have done that here for one of the most important terms .",
    "we are interested in a simpler question : ` how common is _ life _ in the universe ? ' our question is simpler because life is more generic than intelligent or technological life .",
    "we modify the drake equation to address our question and introduce a parameter @xmath66 which is a measure of how common life is in the universe .",

    "the mass histogram of detected extrasolar planets peaks at low masses : @xmath80 and is also consistent with this idea ( lineweaver and grether 2002 , zucker and mazeh 2001 , tabachnik and tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "our analysis assumed the existence of a group of terrestrial planets with approximately the same , but unknown ( @xmath81 $ ] ) probability of biogenesis .",
    "it is reasonable to postulate the existence of such a @xmath4-group since , although we do not know the details of the chemical evolution that led to life , we have some ideas about the factors involved : energy flux , temperatures , the presence of water , planet orbit , residence time in the continuously habitable zone , mass of the planet , atmospheric composition , bombardment rate at the end of planetary accretion and its dependence on the masses of the large planets in the planetary system , metallicity of the prestellar molecular cloud , crust composition , vulcanism , basic chemistry , hydration , ph , presence of particular clay minerals , amino acids and other molecular building blocks for life ( lahav 1999 ) . since all or many of these physical variables determine the probability of biogenesis , and since the earth does not seem to be special with respect to any of them ( i.e. , the earth probably does not occupy a thinly populated region of this multi - dimensional parameter space ) , the assumption that the probability of biogenesis on these planets would be approximately the same as on earth is plausible .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that @xmath4 is a `` slowly '' varying function of environment .",
    "if true , @xmath70 and @xmath66 are not vanishingly small .",
    "this can be contrasted with the `` exponentially sensitive '' case discussed in section [ sec : sensitive ] .",
    "carter ( 1983 ) has pointed out that the timescale for the evolution of intelligence on the earth ( @xmath82 gyr ) is comparable to the main sequence lifetime of the sun ( @xmath83 gyr ) . under the assumption that these two timescales are independent , he argues that this would be unlikely to be observed unless the average timescale for the evolution of intelligence on a terrestrial planet is much longer than the main sequence lifetime of the host star ( see livio ( 1999 ) for an objection to the idea that these two timescales are independent ) .",
    "carter s argument is strengthened by recent models of the terrestrial biosphere that indicate that the gradual increase of solar luminosity will make earth uninhabitable in a billion years or so  several billion years before the sun leaves the main sequence ( rampino and caldiera 1994 , caldeira and kasting 1992 ) .",
    "our analysis is similar in style to carter s , however we are concerned with the appearance of the earliest life forms , not the appearance of intelligent life .",
    "subject to the caveats raised in section 3.3 and by livio ( 1999 ) , the implications of our analysis and carter s are consistent and complementary : the appearance of life on terrestrial planets may be common but the appearance of intelligent life may be rare .      * our _ existence _ on earth",
    "does not mean that the probability of biogenesis on a terrestrial planet , @xmath4 , is large , because if @xmath4 were infinitesimally small and there were only one life - harboring planet in the universe we would , of necessity , find ourselves on that planet .",
    "however , such a scenario would imply either that earth has a unique chemistry or that terrestrial biogenesis has taken a long time to occur .",
    "neither is supported by the evidence we have . since little",
    "can be said about the probability @xmath4 , of terrestrial biogenesis from our existence , we assume maximum ignorance : @xmath5 .",
    "we then use the observation of rapid terrestrial biogenesis to constrain @xmath4 ( fig .  4 ) .",

    "if terrestrial planets are common and they have approximately the same probability of biogenesis as the earth , our inference of high @xmath4 ( or high @xmath63 ) indicates that a substantial fraction of terrestrial planets have life and thus life is common in the universe .    however , there are assumptions and selection effects that complicate this result :    * although we correct the analysis for the fact that biogenesis is a prerequisite for our existence , our result depends on the plausible assumption that * _ rapid _ * biogenesis is not such a prerequisite . *",
    "although we have evidence that the fraction of planets which are ` terrestrial ' in a broad astronomical sense ( rocky planet in the continuously habitable zone ) is large , this may be different from the fraction of planets which are ` terrestrial ' in a more detailed chemical sense .",
    "although we can make reasonable estimates of what the crusts and atmospheres are made of , without detailed knowledge of the steps of chemical evolution , we can not be sure that astronomically terrestrial planets have the same @xmath4 as earth . that is , the fraction of planets belonging to the earth s @xmath4-group is uncertain . thus , although we have been able to quantify the @xmath71 term of the drake equation using rapid biogenesis , our knowledge of the @xmath70 term is still only qualitative and inhibits our ability to draw stronger conclusions about how common life is in the universe .",
