    "several experimental groups have successfully created spinor becs of @xmath0na @xcite and @xmath1rb atoms @xcite .",
    "spinor gases exhibit richer quantum effects than their single - component counterparts , and allow to investigate mesoscopic magnetism .",

    "remarkably , the experimental preparation of only two interacting particles in a double well has been just reported @xcite , and in principle the extension to three particles is feasible by the state - of - the art experiments @xcite .",
    "these experimental achievements have generated an intense theoretical effort in few - body quantum systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . despite their simplicity",
    ", they still constitute a very challenging research field .    in this work",
    "we investigate the ground - state properties of few spin-1 bosons in a double well .",
    "such systems can be viewed as building blocks of optical lattices with cold atoms that can be in three different hyperfine states . besides the usual hubbard - type repulsion",
    ", the model includes a spin - dependent attractive interaction between the particles , which may favor the establishment of a high or low spin state in each of the wells depending on the sign of the coupling constant of this interaction .",
    "our basic goal is to study changes in the characteristics of the ground state induced by variations of the model parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the hamiltonian and its diagonalization .",
    "a detailed analysis of the two - particle system is developed in sec .",

    "@xcite , we write a variant of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian for a system composed of two wells , at positions @xmath2 ( left ) and @xmath3 ( right ) , as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation operators of a boson in a given well ( @xmath7 ) and in the spin state @xmath8 ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the number and total - spin operators for each well .",
    "we assume a single level per well in the zero - tunneling limit ( @xmath11 ) , with energies @xmath12 .",
    "this means that @xmath13 is an asymmetry ( or _ tilt _ ) parameter , since the wells are identical only for @xmath14 .",
    "all interactions in the model are local . apart from the usual ( repulsive ) hubbard interaction @xmath15 , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) describes a spin - dependent interaction with coupling constant @xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted that this term contributes only when more than one particles are present in the same well , in which case low- and high - spin states are favored for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the number and spin operators appearing in the hamiltonian are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , in terms of the usual spin-1 matrices .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) we can see that the total number of particles ( @xmath21 ) , the total spin ( @xmath22 ) , as well as any component of the latter ( which we will choose to be @xmath23 ) are conserved quantities .",
    "it is natural to investigate the properties of a system with fixed number of particles .",
    "moreover , since the energies do not depend on the value of @xmath23 , we can restrict our analysis to the subspace with @xmath23 eigenvalue equal to zero , as this subspace is always present for any number of spin-1 particles .",
    "a convenient basis is provided by a set of vectors of the form @xmath24 , labeled by the number and spin values in each well , and the total spin @xmath25 .",
    "bosonic symmetry imposes that @xmath26 must be an even integer @xcite ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is an interesting basis because it explicitly separates subspaces of different values of @xmath25 , which are not connected by the hamiltonian .",
    "however , to deal with the tunneling term it is better to use appropriate symmetric combinations of vectors of type @xmath28 , specifying the number of particles per spin state in each well . since these two sets of vectors are related by clebsh - gordon coefficients , it is straightforward to generate any matrix elements .",
    "all results that we will discuss here were obtained starting from exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix for a given set of model parameters and particle number .",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath15 was kept fixed , and chosen to be the energy unit .",
    "hence , in what follows we set @xmath29 , it being implicitly assumed that any quantity with dimension of energy is expressed in units of @xmath15 .",
    "we begin by investigating the energy spectrum for the simplest case , @xmath30 , with emphasis on changes in the ground state when varying the parameters of the hamiltonian .    as an example , fig .",

    "we recall that the local energy levels are @xmath13 and @xmath34 for left ( @xmath2 ) and right ( @xmath3 ) wells , respectively , which can be related to their depths .",

    "these minima become much sharper when the tunneling is reduced , as shown by the dashed curve , for which they appear at different @xmath13 values because a different @xmath16 was chosen .     for @xmath30 , with two sets of values of tunneling amplitude and spin - dependent coupling : @xmath45 ( solid line , right y - axis ) , and",
    "@xmath46 ( dashed , left y - axis).,width=302 ]      although the fidelity finds parameter values for which the ground sate changes , it does not give direct information about the nature of states . for this",
    "we need to evaluate ( average values of ) relevant physical quantities .",
    "an obvious one is the occupation number of each well @xcite .",
    "also interesting is the spin correlation function , usually employed to study magnetic properties of solids , as they are directly associated with magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the latter not only gives the response to an applied field , but serves to signal the establishment of magnetic order .",
    "the concept of magnetic order does not make sense in a small system as the one that we are studying .",
    "however , spin correlation functions can give important information about the nature of the ground state with respect to relative orientations of the spins .",
    "we define the spin correlation function between the two wells as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the total spin operator associated to the left and right wells , respectively .    figure [ fig : nrcn2 ] shows typical behavior of the right - well occupation number and inter - well spin correlation function for two particles , in the same range of relative depths as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidn2 ] .",
    "the staircase behavior of @xmath50 is easy to understand on the basis of a competition between the on - site repulsion , that tends to keep particles apart , and the energy asymmetry , that favors occupation of the deepest well .",

    "well ( solid line ) and inter - well spin correlation function ( dashed ) as a function of @xmath13 for two particles , with the same parameters that show sharp minima in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidn2].,width=302 ]    by the definition ( [ eq : corr ] ) , @xmath51 is zero if one of the wells is empty or doubly occupied with zero total spin , which is observed in the large @xmath52 regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : nrcn2 ] . in the single - occupation regime",
    ", we see that the spin correlation is negative , reflecting the fact that @xmath53 favors a low total spin in each well , which is consistent with tunneling to singly occupied states with opposite spins .",
    "this is similar to the mechanism of exchange interaction between localized electrons of neighboring atoms in a crystal , although in that case , due to the exclusion principle , there is no need for a spin dependent interaction .    the results shown up to now correspond to a weak positive @xmath16 .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fig : fidn2 ] it is possible to see that the single - occupation range shrinks as @xmath16 grows .",
    "this regime disappears when @xmath16 exceeds a critical value @xmath54 , since the attractive effect of @xmath55 overcomes the repulsion @xmath15 , favoring formation of a zero - spin pair in the deeper well .    in the case of @xmath56 , still for a two - boson system , the spin correlation behaves similarly to what was seen for @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrcn2 ] , except that the sign of @xmath51 is reversed .",
    "double occupancy continues to be favored by @xmath16 , but now with maximum total spin in the doubly occupied well .",
    "hence , the single - occupation region for small @xmath57 will show ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the critical value for suppression of this regime is now @xmath58 ( meaning @xmath59 ) .",
    "it is interesting to see a complete picture of the case @xmath61 , varying the asymmetry parameter @xmath13 and the spin - dependent interaction @xmath16 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapn2 ] .",
    "the limiting lines of the various regions were obtained from fidelity minima ( mostly @xmath62 , but the line at @xmath63 is better seen with @xmath64 ) . in regions",
    "i and ii there is double occupation of the @xmath2 well , with @xmath65 and 2 , respectively",
    ". regions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are equivalent to i and ii , but the particles are located in the @xmath3 side .",
    "states of one particle in each well are observed in the two central regions , iii and iv , respectively with negative and positive spin correlations .",
    "borrowing denominations from magnetism , we can say that spin correlations are antiferromagnetic ( af ) in region iii and ferromagnetic ( fm ) in iv .",
    "it is worth observing that the characterization of states in terms of doubly or singly occupied wells refers to the average occupation .",
    "fluctuations occur for any @xmath68 , so that the sharp boundary lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : mapn2 ] are only sharp for very weak tunneling .",
    "for instance , choosing a favorable condition for single occupancy inside region iii ( e.g , symmetric wells and small @xmath57 ) , a possible measure of the probability of double occupancy is given by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fidelity between the ground - states with zero and nonzero tunneling .",
    "this is shown as a function of @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : doubleocc ] , where we can see that it is null for decoupled wells , and grows with the tunneling strength , approaching @xmath72 for large @xmath73 , when all possible occupancies become energetically equivalent .",

    "figure  [ fig : fidnrn3 ] shows the fidelity and @xmath3-well occupation for varying @xmath13 .",
    "the plot is for @xmath53 , but the behavior for negative @xmath16 is qualitatively the same . notice that there is a central minimum of the fidelity , corresponding to the extra step observed for @xmath50 , but no central plateau , in contrast with fig .",
    "[ fig : fidn2 ] , since it is impossible to have the same number of particles in both wells .",
    "the most striking difference comes from the spin correlation function , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrn3 ] . for positive @xmath16",
    "the correlation is negative but close to zero except , for a slight increase in magnitude near the changes of ground - state .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is always either zero or two particles in one of the wells , which means that one of the spins is always essentially null .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath77 the whole central region , where none of the wells is empty , presents a large positive correlation between the spins of the two wells .",
    "as in the two - particle case , when the magnitude of a negative @xmath16 grows beyond a critical value ( once more , @xmath78 ) , all three particles stick together in one of the wells ( with maximum spin @xmath79 ) , so that the two inner regions around the central minimum in fig .",

    "it then follows that the eigenvalue associated with the @xmath16 term [ see eq .  ]",

    "this is exemplified in fig .",

    "[ fig : mapn3 ] for odd @xmath94 , except that the central part has a growing number of nested regions as the number of possible distributed occupations increases .",
    "we studied the possible ground states of spin-1 bosons in double - well potentials .",
    "such systems can model the basic unit of optical lattices with trapped cold atoms , for which parameters such as the depth of the wells , amplitude of tunneling between them and interactions between particles can be controlled .",
    "we based our analysis on the usual bose - hubbard hamiltonian with an additional on - site spin - dependent interaction , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    even considering different total numbers of particles , restriction to two wells allowed us to exactly diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix in relevant subspaces , and to study changes of the ground state induced by variation of the model parameters .",
    "our analysis focused primarily on a regime of weak tunneling relative to the local repulsive ( hubbard ) interaction , which we kept fixed .",
    "the variable parameters were then the relative depth between the two wells and the local spin - dependent coupling , which we allowed to be positive or negative , respectively favoring low and high total spin in each well .",
    "we showed that regime changes in the system can be detected by evaluating the ground - state fidelity as some parameter is varied .",
    "this quantity presents sharp minima at parameter values for which the nature of the ground state changes , which should correspond to critical values for occurrence of quantum phase transitions in the macroscopic limit .",
    "information on the nature of the different ground states has to be sought through evaluation of average values of appropriate physical quantities , like the number of particles and total spin in a given well , or inter - well spin correlations .",
    "the results allowed us to construct maps of different regimes in parameter space , identifying regions of full occupancy of a single well , and regions with particles distributed in both wells , in which case either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin correlations between the two wells occur as a consequence of the spin - dependent interaction .",
    "this was done in detail for system of two and three particles .",
    "comparison with some results for four and five particles revealed that the main qualitative differences occur between even and odd total number of particles in the system .",
    "this study can be extended to larger numbers , not only of particles but also of wells , the limitations being only computational .",
    "work in dynamical processes in the same model is now in progress , including investigation of spin effects on transistor - like behavior @xcite in the three - well case .",
    "additionally , by increasing the number of wells we can address the problem of anderson localization @xcite with a distribution of well depths , taking into account the effect of nonzero spin and spin - dependent interactions .    a. f. thanks a. wagner for sharing important information , and acknowledges invaluable discussions with s. jochim .",
