    "condensates of resonantly pumped exciton - polaritons in semiconductor microcavities constitute a novel and exciting system for the study of fundamental physical properties of superfluids out of equilibrium  @xcite , and for future device applications  @xcite . being quantum superpositions of light and matter they are privileged candidates for the realization of the next generation of optical devices  @xcite , for example for quantum information technologies .    from the point of view of the fundamental physical properties ,",
    "particularly interesting is the case of a coherently pumped polariton superfluid in presence of defects . here , in contrast to the corresponding equilibrium case , a weak residual drag force is always present even at extremely high polariton densities  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , properties paradigmatical of an equilibrium superfluids , such as frictionless flow of polariton bullets  @xcite , quantized vortices and metastable persistent flow  @xcite , and the appearance and disappearance of cerenkov - like waves  @xcite have been recently observed in coherently driven exciton - polaritons .    in view of the potential device applications ,",
    "especially important is the unique versatility of the polaritonic system , which , combined with its high non - linear properties , have been already demonstrated to produce parametric scattering  @xcite and bistability  @xcite . here",
    ", the implementation of logic operations and gates comes in a natural way : by manipulating the non - linear properties of the system using several lasers which frequencies , angles of incidence , and intensities can be freely varied externally .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a new realization of a two - component polariton system coherently driven by two lasers with independently tunable frequencies , angles of incidence and intensities .",
    "firstly , we study the stability of the two polariton components when the two laser intensities are varied . differently from the case of a single laser pump , where the system can only be bistable , we disclose a rich phase diagram , where either one , two or three stable states can coexist at given pumping conditions .",
    "then we suggest possible easily tunable multistable hysteresis cycles when the two pumping lasers are varied up and down in intensities .",
    "alternatively , a multicomponent polariton fluid can be realized by considering the polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "multistability of different polariton spin states has been recently proposed theoretically  @xcite and confirmed experimentally  @xcite by the observation of three stable spin states for a given excitation condition . for the case of two polarized components , multistability in space",
    "have also been theoretically proposed  @xcite and experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "for the system with two pumping lasers presented here , the same kind of spatial multistability is expected but with much more complex features . additionally , superimposed to the spatial multistability",
    ", interference fringes will appear due to the difference in frequency and momentum of the two pumping lasers .",
    "the analogy with the two - component polarized case , suggests that , aside from the interest in investigating multistability , two - component polariton condensates obtained with independent lasers can also be used to realize switches  @xcite and memories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the model used to describe the steady state behavior of polaritons excited by two continuous - wave lasers with different frequencies , wave - vectors and intensities . the results obtained within a linear response framework",
    "are shown in section iii . in this section",
    "we study the number of the possible solutions , their nature and possible kerr or parametric instabilities associated to them . as a consequence of the presence of multiple stable solutions ,",
    "different cycles of hysteresis can be produced by varying , along different paths , the intensities of the two pumping lasers .",
    "finally , section iv contains the conclusions drawn from our analysis .",

    "because of the continuous decay , a stationary state requires a continuous injection of photons . here , we consider two continuous - wave laser fields , @xmath15 with independently tunable frequencies @xmath16 and momenta @xmath17 , which can be experimentally changed by changing the laser angle of incidence with respect to the growth direction .",

    ", we analyse the dynamical stability of the two - pump - frequency solution against the weak population of satellite states @xmath24 via parametric scattering processes . through the paper , we will consider only dynamically stable two - pump - frequency solutions . in this approximation , we obtain the following mean - field equations for @xmath25 : @xmath26\\psi_{1_x}^{ss}+      \\frac{\\omega_r}{2}\\psi_{1_c}^{ss}=0 \\\\    [ \\omega_c({\\bf k}_1)-\\omega_1-i\\kappa_c]\\psi_{1_c}^{ss}+    \\frac{\\omega_r}{2}\\psi_{1_x}^{ss}+f_1 = 0 \\\\    [ \\omega_x-\\omega_2-i\\kappa_x+g_{21}]\\psi_{2_x}^{ss}+    \\frac{\\omega_r}{2}\\psi_{2_c}^{ss}=0 \\\\    [ \\omega_c({\\bf k}_2)-\\omega_2-i\\kappa_c]\\psi_{2_c}^{ss}+    \\frac{\\omega_r}{2}\\psi_{2_x}^{ss } + f_2 = 0 \\ ; , \\end{cases } \\label{eq : stead}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "note that the repulsive interaction term between excitons in different states is two times larger the interaction term between excitons in the same mode , resulting in a non - uniform blue - shift .",
    "the mean - field system of equations   can have up to 9 solutions , i.e. 6 solutions more than in the case of one pumping laser , but , as discussed below , only a maximum of 3 solutions are stable",

    "expanding eq .   up to linear terms in @xmath31",
    ", we obtain 4 terms oscillating at frequencies @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which we neglect , and 4 terms oscillating at @xmath24 . in other words",
    ", we are checking the stability of our solution , where only the two states with frequencies @xmath16 are occupied , against the weak population of the satellite states @xmath24 which can be populated by parametric scattering processes .",
    "the fact that we consider only linear terms in @xmath34 and @xmath35 implies that we can obtain only the threshold conditions for such parametric processes , as well as the nature of the instability , whether of kerr - type or parametric - type  see later .",
    "the equations for @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be written as an eigenvalue equation rearranging the excitations into an 8-component vector @xmath36 : @xmath37    \\mathbb{u}_{{{\\mathbf k } } } = 0\\ ; . \\label{eq : eigen}\\ ] ] here matrices @xmath38 with @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by    @xmath42    with @xmath43 being the total excitonic density . at given values of the pumping strength @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "the solutions of the mean - field equations   are stable if all the eight eigenvalues ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) of eq .",
    "have negative imaginary part for every value of the momentum @xmath48 .",
    "for some choices of the system parameters , we find that the number of stable solutions can be larger than one . in the case of one pumping laser , the typical @xmath49-like shape dependence of the polariton field intensity on the pump strength , also referred to as optical bistability , can be explained in terms of the non - linear blue - shift induced by the polariton - polariton interaction  @xcite . when the laser frequency is well above the bare lower polariton dispersion , @xmath50 , and the pump intensity increases from low values , the polariton population remains small because it is hard for the laser to inject polartions with a different energy .",
    "however , increasing the pump power , the blue - shift pulls the polariton energy towards resonance with the pump causing the population to grow superlinearly and eventually to abruptly jump to a high value when the pump intensity reaches a critical value @xmath51 . in the opposite situation ,",
    "when the laser intensity is decreased from high values , the polariton energy is blue - detuned close to the pumping laser frequency and , therefore , the cavity is efficiently filled by the laser even at low pumping intensities . in this case the polariton population jumps down back at low polariton densities for a value @xmath52 of the pump strength lower than @xmath51 .",
    "the two jumps at different values of the pump intensity cause therefore a hysteresis cycle .",
    "as explained below , in the case of two - component fluids , the situation becomes even richer .",
