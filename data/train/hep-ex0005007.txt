    "the dominant motivation for high energy muon colliders ( hemcs ) is unquestionably to explore elementary particle physics at many - tev energy scales . for the sake of completeness",
    ", however , this paper instead discusses what would be the most promising subsidiary fixed target physics program , namely , the parasitic use of the free and profuse neutrino beams at hemcs to provide complementary precision studies of high energy physics ( hep ) at lower energies .",
    "perhaps , this might complement collider studies in fostering new and helpful insights into the properties of elementary particles .",
    "neutrino interactions have unique potential for precision hep studies because they only participate in the weak interaction . today s",
    "neutrino beams from pion decays lack the intensity to fully exploit this potential but future muon ring neutrino experiments ( murines ) , using neutrino beams from the decays of muons in a muon collider or other storage ring , hold the promise of neutrino beams that are several orders of magnitude more intense than today s beams  @xcite .",
    "the first murines may well be muon storage rings dedicated to neutrino production  @xcite ( `` neutrino factories '' ) while the collider rings of any first generation muon colliders will also make excellent murines .",
    "the topic of this paper is murines at very high energies and these will be referred to as `` mighty murines ''  .    at a minimum",
    ", mighty murines will improve on previous murines in providing much useful bread - and - butter precision hep to feed the hungry masses of hep experimentalists with aversions to collider mega - experiments .",
    "more interestingly , there are a couple of plausible scenarios under which they might do much more ; namely ( i ) if quark mixing and/or b physics offer more than predicted by our naive prejudices as parameterized in the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles , and ( ii ) if leptoquarks or other exotica begin to emerge at or below the 100 gev energy scale .",
    "the following section surveys the experimental conditions and parameters that might be found at mighty murines .",
    "this is followed by an overview of the potential physics analyses and by three sections going into more detail on the most interesting topics : one each on exploiting mighty murines as b factories , on the possibilities for quark mixing studies and on the potential for heavy particle production up to the 100 gev scale .",
    "neutrinos are emitted from the decay of muons in the collider ring : @xmath4        as is illustrated in figure  [ nu_beam ] , the thin pencil beams of neutrinos for experiments will be produced from the most suitable long straight sections in the collider ring or , possibly , in the accelerating rings .",
    "these will be referred to as the production straight sections .",
    "the divergence of the neutrino beam is typically dominated by the decay opening angles of the neutrinos rather than the divergence of the parent muon beam .",
    "relativistic kinematics boosts the forward hemisphere in the muon rest frame into a narrow cone in the laboratory frame with a characteristic opening half - angle , @xmath5 , given in obvious notation by @xmath6}.                                                     \\label{eq : thetanu}\\ ] ] for the example of 5 tev muons , the neutrino beam will have an opening half - angle of approximately 0.02 mrad .",
    "the large muon currents and tight collimation of the neutrinos results in such intense neutrino beams that potential radiation hazards  @xcite are a serious design issue for the neutrino beam - line and even for the less intense neutrino fluxes emanating from the rest of the collider ring .      for a cylindrical experimental target extending out from the beam center to an angle @xmath7 ,",
    "the luminosity , @xmath8 , is proportional to the product of the mass depth of the target , @xmath9 , and the number of muon decays per second in the beam production straight section , according to : @xmath10 } = { \\rm n_{avo } \\times                             f_{ss } \\times n_\\mu\\,[s^{-1 } ] } \\times                             \\mathit{l } { \\rm [ g.cm^{-2}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the fraction of the collider ring circumference occupied by the production straight section , @xmath12 is the rate at which each sign of muons is injected into the collider ring ( assuming they all circulate until decay rather than being eventually extracted and dumped ) and the appropriate units are given in square brackets in this equation and all later equations in this paper .",
    "the proportionality constant is avagadro s number , @xmath13 , since exactly one neutrino per muon is emitted on average into the boosted forward hemisphere , i.e. each muon decay produces two neutrinos and half of them travel forwards in the muon rest frame .    because avagadro s number is so large",
    ", the luminosities at mighty murines will be enormous compared to those at collider experiments .",
    "the luminosities for a reasonable scenario using the workshop s straw - man parameter sets  @xcite are given in table  [ tab : eandl ] along with , for comparison , the final design goal luminosity for the hera ep collider .",
    "it can be seen that , roughly speaking , mighty murines might achieve of order a million times the luminosity of hera .",
    "an `` accelerator year s '' running ",
    "@xmath14 seconds  at the 50 tev murine s luminosity of @xmath15 would amount to an impressive integrated luminosity of 200 inverse _",
    "atto_barns per year while the even bigger straw - man luminosity at 5 tev , @xmath16 , requires a luminosity prefix that is even less familiar to the hep community : 10 inverse",
    "_ zepto_barns per year .",
    "it will be seen in section  [ sec : heavy ] that hera provides a useful comparison for some of the physics capabilities of mighty murines , particularly since the maximum center - of - mass energies , @xmath17 , at the highest energy hemcs might even be comparable to those at the hera collider .",
    "the electron - proton @xmath17 at the collider is given by relativistic kinematics as @xmath18 which is 314 gev for the proton and electron energies of the year 2000 upgrade to hera , @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 gev .",
    "for comparison , the murine s @xmath17 is @xmath21 where the proton mass corresponds to @xmath22 gev .",
    "the neutrino energy can range right up to the muon beam energy , @xmath23 , and the energy spectrum seen by the detector is relatively hard  @xcite , with an average neutrino energy within the @xmath24 cone that is 49% of the muon beam energy .",
    "the comparative center - of - mass energies for mighty murines and hera are summarized in table  [ tab : eandl ] .",
    ".energy , luminosity and event rates for mighty murines at the 10 tev and 100 tev com muon colliders given in the hemc99 straw - man parameter sets .",

    "the energy and luminosity at hera are provided for comparison .",
    "the event rates assume fractional straight section lengths of @xmath25 for the 5 + 5 tev and 50 + 50 tev parameter sets , respectively , and a detector mass - per - unit - area of @xmath26 that intercepts the neutrino beam out to an angle @xmath7 subtended at the beam production straight section . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : physics ]    the hera event samples involving weak interactions can be compared with murines at energies where the high energy tail of the neutrino beam is comparable to the 314 gev hera center - of - mass energy .",
    "the maximum neutrino energy is the muon beam energy , which , according to equation  [ eq : murine_ecom ] , equals the hera com energy for @xmath27 tev . at this energy or slightly above",
    ", very rough estimates of the event rates of similar or identical processes can be simply transcribed from hera calculations after scaling by the @xmath28 luminosity ratio shown in table  [ tab : eandl ] .",
    "such a comparison is shown in table  [ tab : physics ] .",
    "a range of murine energies has been given , in deference to the very approximate nature of the comparison .",
    "at the low end ( @xmath29 tev ) , the murine event rates will probably be lower than the estimate , and the rates will normally be higher at the high end ( @xmath30 tev ) .    the standard model physics processes involving weak interactions are the same in all cases except for the production of w and z bosons , where hera has the advantage due to processes involving photon exchange",
    ". the sm higgs has not been found at the time of writing , so the 120 gev mass is an example only .",
    "the first three processes in table  [ tab : physics ] have already been discussed in the preceding section . to be realistic , at the event rates shown it",
    "is very doubtful that w , z and sm higgs production could contribute anything useful beyond collider studies , despite the the astounding neutrino beam parameters and superior event reconstruction . beyond this , possible exotic processes at the 100 gev scale or below",
    "provide the only substantial potential for exciting discoveries .",
    "this motivation could become much stronger in the near future if , for example , one of the current leptoquark searches at hera returned a discovery .",
    "it is noted that the leptoquarks produced at a mighty murine might well be different  coupling to neutrinos rather than electrons  and",
    "so studies at murines could potentially be complementary to those at a future ep collider with a higher @xmath31 than hera .",
    "the mighty murine neutrino experiments that would come almost for free at any future many - tev muon collider could improve on the pioneering advances from the previous murines that would have existed at lower energy muon colliders .",
    "the most important improvements might well be on the unique and important measurements from previous lower energy murines of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , perhaps pushing the accuracy of both measurements below 1% . with total event statistics of a few times @xmath32 events , the rare production of b s through flavor changing neutral current interactions off valence",
    "d quarks might provide one of the best indirect determinations of @xmath3 .",
    "more common channels for b production , particularly through neutral current interactions , might also provide some capabilities as a b factory with novel experimental strengths .    upon crossing the threshold for top production , the even more interesting elements @xmath3 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 could become successively available to uniquely precise measurements at the highest energy mighty murines .",
    "the addition of any or all of these three precise measurements would clearly advance our knowledge of the ckm matrix to a level where small perturbations from the standard model scenario could be searched for and , if found , could be studied .",
    "murines would then truly play the central role in determining the ckm matrix parameters , with the best measurements of the magnitudes of perhaps seven of the nine elements ( all but the two elements that are currently best measured : @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) to add to the phase information from various other experimental processes .",
    "if muon colliders ever reach the 100 tev center of mass energy scale then their neutrino experiments will attain a center of mass energy reach comparable to the existing hera ep collider , but at a luminosity that might be perhaps 5 orders of magnitude higher .",
    "hera then becomes a convenient reference point for assessing their physics capabilities . despite the promise of impressive luminosities , none of the standard model processes other than the ckm matrix appear to offer the chance of competitive physics potential to studies of the same processes at colliders",
    "therefore , only i ) an enlarged theoretical importance for the ckm matrix or ii ) the discovery , then or beforehand , of an exotic process that is accessible to mighty murines , would give mighty murines a chance for physics analyses of a comparable importance to those at the colliders .",
