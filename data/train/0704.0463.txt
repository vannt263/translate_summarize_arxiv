    "twa 7 ( 2mass j10423011 - 3340162 , twa 7a ) is a weak - line t tauri star identified as part of the tw hydrae association ( twa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xcite based on proper motion studies in conjunction with youth indicators such as high lithium abundance , x - ray activity and evidence of strong chromospheric activity .",
    "disk systems were inferred around four of the 18 association members @xcite from measurements of ir excess with the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras)_. tw hydra itself ( a k7 pre - main sequence star ) hosts the nearest protostellar disk to the sun .",
    "another accreting disk is observed around one member of the triple system hen 3 - 600 @xcite , and two debris disk systems have been detected , around the a0 star hr 4796a @xcite and one of two spectroscopic binary components of the quadruple system hd 98800 @xcite , which is a k5 dwarf .",
    "twa 7 was not detected by _",
    "iras_.    based on the width of the li 6707 a line , @xcite deduced that twa 7 is a pre - main sequence star .",
    "twa 7 was not detected by hipparcos , but its membership in the twa sets its distance to be @xmath5 pc @xcite .",
    "its spectral type is m1 based on lris spectra @xcite .",
    "based on existing photometry , evolutionary tracks and isochrone fitting , @xcite derived an age of 1 - 6 myr ( i.e. , roughly coeval with other twa stars ) and a mass of 0.55 @xmath6 0.15 @xmath7 . the age of the association is generally taken to be @xmath8 myr @xcite .",
    "this is the age when planet formation is thought to be ongoing and when disk dissipation is occurring .",
    "thus , the twa is the ideal cluster in which to observe the transitions from pre - main sequence stars with proto - planetary ( gas - rich ) disks to main sequence stars with debris ( gas - poor ) disks .",
    "twa 7 has been observed for infrared excess emission several times .",
    "the presence of a disk around twa 7 was first noted in submillimeter observations by @xcite .",
    "they measured a flux of @xmath9 mjy at 850 .",
    "neither @xcite nor @xcite detected any excess associated with twa 7 in the mid - infrared .",
    "however , @xcite report detections of ir excess at 24 and 70  toward twa 7 with the spitzer space telescope . based on these data and existing shorter wavelength data on the stellar photosphere , @xcite derive a disk temperature of 80 k and a lower limit to the mass of @xmath10 g ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) for the disk .",
    "this is a lower limit because the 70  data are not sensitive to colder material in the outer disk and dust grains exceeding a few hundred micron in size .",
    "a search for substellar companions using the nicmos chronograph on hst did not reveal any evidence of the disk @xcite ; a nearby point source is identified as a background object .",
    "the study of debris disks around members of an association permits the study of the evolution of disks as a function of spectral type alone , since the disks likely formed coevally and with similar compositions .",
    "it is also possible to judge whether the presence and evolution of disks around multiple stellar systems is comparable to those around single stars .",
    "the discovery of disks around low - mass stars is relatively recent @xcite .",
    "the low radiation field of late - k and m dwarfs means that the disks are faint in scattered light compared to disks around more massive stars , and hence they were less frequently targeted by scattered light searches for disks .",
    "however , scattered light imaging is often a follow - up technique used after an infrared excess has been discovered ( e.g. , au mic , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the low radiation fields may favor long - lived and slowly evolving disks , since some disk material may be unchanged from the original proto - planetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "spitzer has detected evidence of disks around a few k stars @xcite , but @xcite note that in a sample of 61 k1 to m6 stars , no excess emission is detected at 70 .",
    "this is well below the expected detection rate if the disk fraction is at all comparable to the @xmath13% observed around solar - type stars .",
    "the discovery of disks around k- and m - type dwarfs may be difficult at far - infrared wavelengths because material at similar radii to disks around early - type stars will be cool and will not radiate sufficiently .",
    "however , submillimeter observing sensitivities and the dust temperature conspire to allow these objects to be discovered at submillimeter wavelengths ( zuckerman 2001 ) .",
    "submillimeter observations are sensitive to colder , larger grains , which are more likely to be optically thin than the warmer far - infrared emitting dust @xcite .",

    "the instability of flux calibration in the submillimeter is well known , and may be assuaged somewhat by the ability to flux calibrate more often with scuba-2 , the next generation submillimeter camera on the jcmt . in the interests of consistency with the only 450  detection in this work , we adopt the 850  flux from the later epoch and do not attempt to combine the two datasets .",

    "the dust has a range of temperatures , however there are two different physical motivations behind the origin of this range .    in model 3 ( dotted line of fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) , the dust is assumed to all lie at the same distance from the star , @xmath32 .",
    "it is assumed to have a range of sizes with a power law distribution defined by the relation @xmath33 for grains of size @xmath34 .",
    "this power law is assumed to be truncated below dust of size @xmath35 , the size for which @xmath36 for compact grains .",
    "the dust is assumed to be composed of compact spherical grains of a mixture of organic refractories and silicates @xcite , and interaction with stellar radiation determines the temperature that dust of different sizes attains .",
    "the same model was used in @xcite to model the emission from the fomalhaut disk , where more detail can be found on the modelling method .",
    "the emission spectrum could be fitted by dust at a radius @xmath37 au with a size distribution described by @xmath38 .",
    "the temperatures of dust in this model range from 21 k for the largest grains ( @xmath39 ) to 65 k for the smallest grains ( 0.9 ) .",
    "the size distribution used in model 3 is close to that expected in a collisional cascade wherein dust is replenished by collisions between larger grains , since this results in a size distribution with @xmath40 and would be truncated below the size of dust for which radiation pressure would place the dust on hyperbolic orbits as soon as they are created . the effect of radiation forces on small grains is quantified by the parameter @xmath41 ( which is not to be confused with the index of dust emissivity of grains that moderates the rayleigh - jeans tail of the sed of cold dust ) , and it is dust with @xmath42 which is unbound",
    "however , due to the low luminosity of m stars , it is not clear whether radiation pressure is sufficient to remove dust grains from the disk system .",
    "figure [ betas ] shows @xmath43 as a function of dust grain size for dust around twa 7 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) . while @xmath43 is larger than 0.5 for compact ( @xmath46 ) grains , this condition is only met for a narrow region of the size distribution .",
    "furthermore , if the dust grains are porous , as around au mic @xcite , then no grains will have @xmath47 .",
    "an alternative origin for the small grain cut - off could be stellar wind forces , since these provide a pressure force similar to radiation pressure @xcite , and it is known that stellar wind forces can be significantly stronger than radiation forces for m stars @xcite . while the smallest grain size in the distribution may differ from our value of 0.9 , this does not affect the ability of the model to fit the observed emission spectrum with suitable modifications to the slope in the size distribution and radius of the dust belt .    in model 4 ( dashed line of fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) , the dust grains are assumed to lie at a range of distances from the star , but they are all assumed to emit like black bodies , and so have temperatures @xmath48 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the grains was taken from the model of @xcite in which dust is created in a planetesimal belt at @xmath32 , and then migrates inward due to poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag , but with some fraction of the grains removed by mutual collisions on the way . in the model the dust ends up with a spatial distribution which can be described by the parameter @xmath49 , such that the surface density falls off @xmath50 .",
    "the emission spectrum could be fitted using the parameters @xmath51 au and @xmath52 , resulting in dust with temperatures upwards of 38 k. however , the density of the planetesimal belt required to scale the resulting emission spectrum showed that removal by collisions dominates over the p - r drag force in such a way that @xmath49 should be closer to 1400 in this disk .",
    "thus , if this model is to have a true physical motivation , then we need to invoke a drag force which is @xmath53 times stronger than p - r drag .",
    "such a force could come from the stellar wind , which causes a drag force similar to p - r drag and which can be incorporated into the model by reducing @xmath49 by a factor @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "thus to achieve @xmath52 in this way we would require the stellar wind to be @xmath53 times stronger than that of the sun .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity of twa 7 ( @xmath55 erg / s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be indicative of a strong stellar wind , since measured mass loss rates have been found to increase with x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "however the correlation found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "3 ) breaks down at x - ray fluxes an order of magnitude lower than that of twa 7 ( for which @xmath56 erg @xmath57 s@xmath3 , and so it is not possible to use this flux to estimate the mass loss rate with any certainty , and we simply note that the mass loss rate required to achieve @xmath52 is not incompatible with observations of mass loss rates of other stars .",
    "a stellar wind drag force has also been invoked to explain structure in the au mic disk @xcite .",
    "we note that we are not claiming that the radius , @xmath58 , size distribution , @xmath59 , or parameter @xmath49 have been well constrained by these fits .",
    "the sed does indicate that the disk around twa 7 contains grains at a range of temperatures .",
    "the fits of figure [ sed ] illustrate two ways in which multiple temperatures in the disk may arise from physically motivated models : the dust could have a range of sizes , or it could be distributed over a range of distances .",
    "other models may also fit the data , including those in which dust has a range of distances and sizes , and those in which the dust originates in not one but multiple dust zones , as has been inferred for au mic ( fitzgerald et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the derived fits of figure [ sed ] do show differences in the mid - ir spectrum .",
    "while this suggests that knowledge of the mid - ir spectrum would enable us to distinguish between the two models , it is worth pointing out that the exact shape of this spectrum is very sensitive to the size distributions of small grains ( in model 3 ) and to the radial distribution of grains interior to the planetesimal belt ( in model 4 ) .",
    "thus it is possible that different assumptions about these distributions could be made to provide a fit to the same observed spectrum with both models .",
    "the only way to definitively break the degeneracy is through imaging of the thermal emission from the mid - ir to the submillimeter .",
    "the single radius disk must look the same at all wavelengths , while a radially distributed disk would look larger at longer wavelengths , as more of the cold dust further from the star is detected .",
    "@xcite estimate the minimum mass in dust of the twa 7 disk to be @xmath60 , under the assumption that the dust grain size is 2.8 . in determining the mass of the disk from submillimeter measurements ,",
    "a key parameter is the temperature of the dust .",
    "where possible , we discuss the derived mass for each of the models discussed above . for submillimeter fluxes , we can estimate the mass of the disk directly for an assumed temperature and opacity from the relation :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the planck function at the dust temperature , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the absorption coefficient of the dust .",
    "the derived mass is a strongly dependent function of the value of @xmath64 . for debris disk studies ,",
    "a value of 1.7 @xmath2 g@xmath3 is appropriate at 850  @xcite .",
    "this is at the upper end of the values derived by @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the mass in model 1 by using the submillimeter flux predicted from the rayleigh - jeans tail of the model ( 2.4 mjy ) as well as the 80 k temperature and standard opacity .",
    "this gives a mass of 0.025 @xmath1 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as the mass of hot dust , with the proviso that the submillimeter observation shows that there is more mass in colder dust as well .",
    "model 2 fits the submillimeter and 70  emission well . under the estimate of 45 k for the dust temperature of the disk , the standard dust opacity and the measured 850  flux , the twa 7 disk contains 0.2 @xmath1 of material ( 18 @xmath0 ) .",
    "based on the uncertainty in the flux ( random and systematic ) , the uncertainty on the mass estimates are @xmath66% .",
    "the mass of the twa 7 disk is an order of magnitude greater than the mass of 0.011 @xmath1 for the disk detected around au mic @xcite that is also derived based on a single temperature fit to far - ir and submillimeter data with @xmath67 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "model 3 contains dust grains at different temperatures based on their size . in this case , the size distribution of dust is well defined ( i.e. , with known scaling ) , the total mass of dust is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mass in earth masses and @xmath70 is in meters .",
    "while it is impossible to observationally know @xmath70 ( since large planetesimals are effectively invisible ) , in our model 95% of the 850  flux comes from grains @xmath71 m. this implies a mass of 6 @xmath1 , significantly higher than that of model 2 . in the twa 7 system , @xmath70 could be even larger ( or smaller ) than this , so this discrepency carries little definitive weight .",
    "the size distribution is relatively shallow ( i.e. , there are lots of large grains ) which explains why the mass is much larger than in model 2 .    to derive a mass for model 4",
    "we assume an opacity of 1.7 @xmath2 g@xmath3 and determine the mass of dust in the model required to reproduce the observed 850  flux , given that the dust has a range of temperatures .",
    "the derived mass is almost exactly the same as that at of model 2 at @xmath72 .",
    "this is to be expected because the submillimeter flux in both models is dominated by the coldest dust at 38 - 45 k , and very little additional mass is required in model 4 to explain the mid - ir emission ( as illustrated by the low mass in model 1 ) .",
    "given the inherent assumptions and unknowns in each of these models , we adopt the results of the highly simple model 2 as our most robust estimate of the mass of the dust disk in twa 7 .",
    "it depends on the temperature of the grains producing the observed 850  flux , which are well fit by the cold dust model of figure [ sed_1temp ] .",
    "the mass is also highly dependent on the value of @xmath64 , for which we have adopted a value in line with other disk modeling work @xcite , and so can be compared with the disk masses derived by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent mips data from the spitzer space telescope show that most stars in the twa show no evidence of circumstellar dust out to 70 @xcite .",
    "these results confirm the assertion of @xcite and @xcite that there is a bimodal distribution in the twa : either stars have strong excesses associated with warm dust emission , or they have very weak emission consistent with very cold disks .",

    "based on their data , @xcite deduced that the non - detections implied an absence of material in terrestrial planet region and that , except for tw hya , there were no long - lived disks in the association which could still form planets .",
    "an outstanding question is whether the stars without warm disks have potential disk material locked up in undetected planets , which would imply that dusty systems represent failed planetary systems , or whether non - detections represent disk systems in which the dust is too cold to be detected in the mid - ir . only large - scale searches for cold dust around a statistically significant number of stars can clarify whether a sizable population of disks exist which are too cold to detect at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "such a survey is planned using the new scuba-2 camera at the jcmt @xcite .",
    "the disks now known in the twa each have very different properties .",
    "the disk around tw hya ( k7 ) still contains molecular gas @xcite , meaning it is proto - planetary or in a transition from a proto - planetary to a debris disk .",

    "in fact , hd 98800 is a quadruple system , so the dust is in a circumbinary orbit around a spectroscopic binary .",

    "their mips observation found optically thin disks around a - type stars , no disks around solar - like stars , and optically thick , accreting disks around k- and m - type dwarfs , suggesting that disk evolution proceeds more quickly around higher mass stars .",
