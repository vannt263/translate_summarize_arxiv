    "the problem of thermalization of the system produced in heavy ion collisions is crucial for our understanding of strong interactions .",
    "while in recent years there has been some significant progress in understanding the initial ( pre - thermalization ) stages of heavy ion collisions in the framework of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite ( for a review of cgc see @xcite ) , a complete theoretical understanding of the subsequent isotropization and thermalization of the produced medium continues to evade us .",
    "the success of hydrodynamics simulation in describing the data generated at rhic is quite impressive : however , it requires a very early starting proper time for hydrodynamics , @xmath4  fm / c @xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical models based on the weak - coupling dynamics so far have not been successful in reproducing such an early thermalization time @xcite . moreover ,",
    "as was suggested by one of the authors @xcite , the perturbative weak - coupling dynamics , describable by feynman diagrams , may in principle be unable to generate isotropization , and , therefore , thermalization in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the only way isotropization and thermalization can be achieved in heavy ion collisions is due to strong - coupling effects .",
    "another more phenomenological argument indicating that strong coupling dynamics could be important for heavy ion collisions at rhic is the fact that hydrodynamic description of the collisions @xcite has to have a very low shear viscosity @xcite : the quark - gluon plasma produced at rhic is almost a perfect fluid .",
    "since the perturbative shear viscosity scales as @xmath5 @xcite one concludes that low viscosity requires large coupling .",
    "such conclusion was confirmed by explicit calculations employing gauge - gravity duality in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the strong coupling regime of qcd is not under theoretical control .",
    "however , for some gauge theories , like @xmath6 super yang - mills theory , the strong coupling regime can be studied using ads / cft correspondence @xcite . to understand the strong coupling dynamics of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions one has to model qcd with @xmath7 super yang - mills theory and use ads / cft correspondence to study the strong - coupling dynamics of such theory . in recent years",
    "there have been many applications of ads / cft correspondence to heavy ion collisions @xcite .    the goal of this paper is to attempt to understand the onset of isotropization and thermalization in the ads / cft framework .",
    "we will consider an idealized bjorken picture of the collision @xcite , in which nuclei have an infinite extent in the transverse plane and the distribution of the produced matter is rapidity - independent : the energy and pressure components of the energy - momentum tensor in the local rest frame would then depend only on the proper time @xmath0 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that isotropization and thermalization of the produced medium do not necessarily happen at the same time : isotropization is necessary for thermalization , but not vice versa .",
    "as was argued in @xcite , in the cgc framework the energy density @xmath1 of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions scales as a power of a logarithm of the proper time @xmath0 , as shown in below .",
    "therefore , the produced matter is anisotropic : its longitudinal pressure component is in fact negative .",
    "isotropization for such matter would imply generation of positive longitudinal pressure , comparable to the transverse pressure components .",
    "note that for isotropization to take place it does not appear necessary for the system to have a thermal distribution : hence thermalization may take place after isotropization , and not necessarily at the same time . below we will study the onset of isotropization , since it is much easier to infer from the components of the energy - momentum tensor .    in a pioneering paper @xcite janik and",
    "peschanski showed that for the strongly - coupled medium produced in heavy ion collisions and described by gauge - gravity duality the late time asymptotics can only lead to bjorken hydrodynamics @xcite with the energy density scaling with proper time as @xmath8 . since then a number of further investigations have been carried out @xcite , mostly concentrating on the subleading at late times viscous corrections to the ideal hydrodynamic behavior of @xcite . in this work",
    "we will take a different route and concentrate on the early time behavior of the strongly coupled medium produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the hope is to verify if such medium is anisotropic at early proper times : if that proves to be the case then the onset of isotropization would necessarily be a part of strongly - coupled medium s dynamics at intermediate proper times .",
    "the idea of studying the matter produced in nuclear collisions at small proper times has been originally suggested in the cgc framework in @xcite .",
    "here we will apply the same concept to the strong - coupling dynamics employing the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin in sect .",
    "[ general ] by setting up the formalism of holographic renormalization in the context of heavy ion collisions with bjorken geometry .",
    "we then proceed in sect .",
    "[ power ] by solving einstein equations ( [ eom1 ] ) in the ads space assuming that the four - dimensional energy density scales as a power of proper time , as given by . in sect .",
    "[ iter ] we will demonstrate the first few steps of the perturbative solution expanding the metric in powers of the fefferman - graham coordinate @xmath9 @xcite . in sect [ bjorken ]",
    "we proceed by re - analyzing the late proper time dynamics : we show that in order to pick the correct bjorken hydrodynamic behavior of the solution of einstein equations ( [ eom1 ] ) one only has to impose the condition that the resulting metric is a real single - valued function of the coordinates everywhere in the bulk .",
    "hence we demonstrate that the condition of non - singularity of the curvature invariant employed in @xcite is not needed to constrain the dynamics in four dimensions from ads / cft .",
    "we then apply the same approach to study the early time dynamics in sect .",
    "[ earlytime ] : we solve einstein equations ( [ eom1 ] ) at small-@xmath0 and , after imposing the condition for the metric to be real and single - valued , we derive that energy density can only go to a constant value as @xmath2 ( see ) .",
    "this is our main result : as the system having constant energy density in heavy ion collisions also has negative longitudinal pressure , we conclude that at very early times the strongly interacting system described by gauge - gravity duality is very anisotropic . at the same time",
    "we know that at late proper times it becomes isotropic evolving according to bjorken hydrodynamics .",
    "we thus demonstrate that the isotropization transition does take place at intermediate times for the evolution of this strongly - coupled system ! moreover , while indeed the early - time energy density in cgc [ ] and in the strongly - coupled medium [ ] behave somewhat differently , the two initial - time behaviors are not entirely unlike each other : in both cases the initial longitudinal pressure is negative , equal to the negative of the energy density , while the transverse pressures are equal to the energy density [ see ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the behavior of the strongly - coupled system studied here may be relevant for real - life heavy ion collisions , where the initial stages of the collisions are successfully described by the cgc .",
    "we verify our result of constant energy density at early times in sect .",
    "[ log ] , where , inspired by cgc @xcite , we look for possible logarithmic scaling of the energy density at early time , but find none .",
    "the energy density remains constant at small @xmath0 , without any logarithmic divergence .    in sect .",
    "[ iso_time ] we match the early time dynamics considered in this work onto the late - time bjorken hydrodynamic solution found in @xcite to estimate the isotropization time ( see ) .",
    "the result is given by .",
    "if we apply this formula to central @xmath10 collisions at rhic at @xmath11  gev we obtain the isotropization time of @xmath12  fm / c , in good agreement with results of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ conc ] by restating our main results and by summarizing our knowledge of energy density as a function of proper time for the strongly - coupled system at hand in .",
    "let us consider a head - on collision of two very large identical nuclei . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the distribution of matter produced in such collisions is independent of ( space - time ) rapidity @xmath13",
    ". since the nuclei are identical the matter distribution should also respect @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) symmetry .",
    "finally , as the nuclei are very large , we assume that they have infinite extent in the transverse directions .",
    "therefore the energy - momentum tensor of the produced matter is independent of the transverse coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "this is indeed the same approximation as employed by bjorken in @xcite .",

    "putting @xmath215 in we obtain @xmath216 , \\hspace*{1 cm } \\text{as }    \\hspace*{1 cm } \\tau \\rightarrow 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we therefore confirm the result of the previous section that the energy density approaches a constant as @xmath2 . demonstrates that the approach to the constant may be logarithmic .",
    "again our derivation never employed the requirement of no singularities of the curvature invariant @xmath133 of @xcite . at the same time",
    "it can be explicitly checked that it does not violate such a requirement .",
    "the curvature invariant for the solution in ( which is also the leading small-@xmath0 solution for the logarithmic scaling considered in this section , as follows from the above ) is @xmath217 here we keep @xmath146 fixed and take @xmath0 to be small .",
    "shows that the non - trivial part of the solution ( [ power_sol_fin ] ) does not contribute to the curvature invariant and , therefore , does not introduce singularities in it .",
    "in fact one can show in general that the first perturbative correction to the metric of the flat ads space satisfying does not contribute to the curvature invariant .",
    "it appears that it would have been impossible to constrain the early times scaling of the energy density using non - singularity of the curvature invariant only .",
    "luckily , we were able to pinpoint the right metric without imposing any additional conditions .",
    "we have shown above that the strongly - coupled system produced in heavy ion collisions with the dynamics described by the ads / cft correspondence starts off at early times with a finite energy density and negative longitudinal pressure component of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "hence , the system at these early times is very asymmetric . on the other hand ,",
    "as was demonstrated by janik and peschanski @xcite , the same strongly - coupled system at asymptotically late times behaves like the ideal bjorken hydrodynamics , with the longitudinal and transverse pressure components equal and positive .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of this strongly - coupled system incorporates the isotropization transition at some intermediate time , and has the potential of solving the thermalization problem in heavy ion collisions . indeed , since the initial condition in real heavy ion collisions described by qcd are likely to be perturbative describable by cgc , to verify the relevance of the strongly - coupled model considered above to the real - life heavy ion collisions it is important to check whether the early times dynamics obtained here agrees with perturbative expectations .",
    "the very early time dynamics was studied in the cgc framework in @xcite with the conclusion that the energy density scales as shown in .",
    "such behavior also leads to negative initial longitudinal pressure , similar to what we observed for the strongly - coupled theory .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the strongly - coupled isotropization scenario is relevant for the real - life heavy ion collisions described by qcd .    with that in mind",
    "let us estimate the onset of isotropic bjorken hydrodynamics in the gauge - gravity duality framework considered here .",
    "first of all , at early times the general solution ( [ power_sol ] ) has a branch - cut discontinuity at @xmath172 . in the @xmath218-space",
    "the branch cut is at @xmath219 on the other hand , the solution found by janik and peschanski @xcite and shown here in has a branch cut at @xmath220 which , with the help of with @xmath77 and corresponding @xmath221 translates into @xmath222    the locations of the starting points of the branch cuts @xmath223 and @xmath224 given by eqs .",
    "( [ zearly ] ) and ( [ zlate ] ) are shown in the @xmath218-plane in .",
    "the two curves in intercept at some time which we label @xmath225 .",
    "it is important to point out that , as can be seen , say , from , the full solution with the power - law ansatz of consists of a sum ( for @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 ) of the solution in @xcite and the solution in found above . while different solutions dominate at different times , both exist at all times .",
    "we now observe that in order to pinpoint the correct solution using the power - law ansatz of as was done above one starts outside the branch cut , i.e. , at @xmath229 for both early and late times , and imposes the no - branch - cut condition as @xmath9 increases past @xmath230 .",
    "for the times before the intersection of the two curves in , @xmath231 , the first branch cut which has to be eliminated is the one starting at @xmath223 .",
    "that fixes the power @xmath174 making the energy density a constant , as described above and shown in . at late times",
    "the first branch cut to be eliminated is at @xmath224 , fixing @xmath232 as described in section [ bjorken ] .",
    "hence the behavior of energy density , or , equivalently , the dominance of either one of the solutions in eqs .",
    "( [ jpsol ] ) and ( [ power_sol ] ) , is determined by which one of the two branch cuts starts at smaller values of @xmath9 . at @xmath233",
    "the early - time solution dominates leading to the energy density scaling of . at @xmath234",
    "the late - time solution dominates leading to bjorken s energy density scaling of . while , strictly speaking both solutions are valid only at either asymptotically early or late times far away from the intersection point shown in , we can estimate the time of the transition between the two regimes by the time of the intercept @xmath225 , defined by the condition @xmath235 using eqs .",
    "( [ zearly ] ) and ( [ zlate ] ) in yields @xmath236 this is our estimate of the isotropization time , the time necessary for hydrodynamics to work and required for thermalization . to determine @xmath68 we write",
    "bjorken energy density scaling as @xmath237 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ ebj1 ] ) and ( [ ebj ] ) we see that @xmath238 which , when substituted into gives @xmath239 note that for a self - consistent conformally - invariant strongly interacting theory the above result is natural : from the scaling of we see that such theory would be characterized only by one dimensionful parameter  @xmath240 . using this parameter",
    "we can construct the time scale , which is @xmath241 . indeed to find the coefficient in front of @xmath241 in one needs to perform a more complete calculation , as was done above .",
    "to evaluate the isotropization time in for central @xmath10 collisions with @xmath11  gev at rhic we use the fact that hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite , which successfully describe a variety of rhic observables , yield the averaged over all impact parameters energy density of @xmath242  gev/@xmath243 @xcite at the proper time @xmath244  fm / c . from these data , using we obtain @xmath245  @xmath246 . substituting this number into with @xmath247 yields @xmath248 which is quite close to the initialization time for the hydrodynamic simulations required to describe rhic data @xcite !",
    "indeed the isotropization time estimate of depends on the final state observable @xmath240 instead of some initial - state observable .",
    "therefore one should indeed question the predictive power of such estimate .",
    "we leave it for the future work to improve on this result and to tie it to some initial state observables .",
    "we conclude by restating our main results . we have re - derived the result of janik and peschanski @xcite stating that at late proper times the system produced in heavy ion collisions in the strongly - coupled regime described by gauge - gravity duality exhibits energy density scaling with time characteristic of bjorken hydrodynamics , as shown in . in such regime",
    "all three pressure components of the energy momentum tensor are equal to each other , as is required for a thermalized medium . to obtain this result",
    "we use a much weaker condition than that used in @xcite : we require the metric to be a real and single - valued function of coordinates in the bulk .",
    "we then explore the dynamics of the same strongly - coupled system at early times and show that the energy density approaches a constant as @xmath2 , as shown in .",
    "the longitudinal pressure of this early system is therefore negative [ see ] .",
    "we have therefore demonstrated that this strongly - coupled system is initially anisotropic , but at late times it becomes isotropic and evolves according to bjorken hydrodynamics .",
    "therefore , a complete solution for the energy density of this system at all times would contain the isotropization transition !",
    "the similarity of the early - time behavior of the system to that of the cgc demonstrates that our conclusions may be relevant to heavy ion collisions in the real world",
    ".    summarizes our knowledge of the energy density in heavy ion collisions as a function of @xmath0 for the strongly - coupled system considered above and in @xcite .",
    "the energy density starts out as a constant , after which the system undergoes an isotropization transition ( denoted by the dashed line in ) resulting in bjorken hydrodynamics .",
    "the exact shape of the dashed curve is indeed unknown : what we plot in is a simple interpolation between the early- and late - time regimes .",
    "more work is needed to develop a better understanding of this important intermediate region .    finally , above we estimated the time of the transition from our regime to that of janik and peschanski .",
    "the estimate is given in .",
    "if applied to rhic , it appears to give the isotropization time @xmath249  fm / c , consistent with the results of hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .    in conclusion",
    "let us point out that the method of requiring the metric to be a real and single - valued function of coordinates could be successfully applied to other related problems .",
    "recently @xmath250 and @xmath251 corrections to the solution of have been calculated in @xcite for late proper times .",
    "one expands @xcite @xmath252 and finds the subleading coefficients @xmath253 and @xmath254 by solving einstein equations perturbatively .",
    "[ the same expansion is done for @xmath255 and @xmath256 . ] taking the @xmath251 correction to the coefficient @xmath257 in , denoted by @xmath258 and given in eq .",
    "( 20 ) of @xcite , one can see that it also has a term proportional to @xmath259 , just like the solution in with @xmath77 : @xmath260 here @xmath261 is the proper - time independent coefficient related to shear viscosity @xmath13 by @xcite @xmath262 again we want the metric to be real and single - valued , hence the coefficient in front of @xmath104 has to be an integer .",
    "note however that @xmath254 enters the metric with a prefactor of @xmath263 as can be seen from , such that the coefficient in front of the logarithm in the metric varies with time .",
    "therefore we conclude that the coefficient in front of @xmath104 can only be zero : this would insure that the metric is real at all times .",
    "putting the coefficient in front of @xmath104 in to zero yields @xmath264 in agreement with the result obtained in @xcite using non - singularity of the curvature invariant criterion , and , as shown in @xcite , in agreement with the kovtun - policastro - son - starinets ( kpss ) viscosity bound @xcite !    here",
    "we have to caution the reader that similar branch cuts in other metric coefficients , like @xmath265 , @xmath266 and @xmath267 , @xmath268 of @xcite can not be eliminated this easily .",
    "( @xmath269 has no branch cut singularity @xcite . )",
    "it is possible that resummation of the whole series of the type shown in for @xmath26 and @xmath27 would be required to eliminate such branch cuts .",
    "we leave the investigation of this important question for future work .",
