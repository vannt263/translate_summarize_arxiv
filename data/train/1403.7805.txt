    ", @xmath248 is @xmath2-hyperbolic and the action of @xmath87 on @xmath248 is by isometries .    since @xmath248 is @xmath2-hyperbolic and @xmath277 for all @xmath278 , it embeds in an @xmath266-tree and the action of @xmath87 on @xmath248 extends to to an isometric action on that @xmath266-tree . also , using the inclusion @xmath279 we obtain an isometric embedding of @xmath247 into an @xmath266-tree . while this @xmath266-tree differs from the one mentioned just before , in both a word @xmath132",
