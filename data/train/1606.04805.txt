    "during the last decade the bike sharing systems are fast increasing as a public transport mode in urban short trips , and have been launched in more than 500 major cities around the world .",
    "also , the bike sharing systems offer a low cost and environmental protection  mobility service through sharing one - way use .",
    "now , the bike sharing systems are regarded as an effective way to jointly solve traffic congestion , parking difficulties , traffic noise , air pollution and so forth .",
    "demaio @xcite reviewed the history , impacts , models of provision and future of the bike sharing systems .",
    "larsen @xcite reported that over 500 major cities host advanced bike sharing systems with a combined fleet of more than half a million bikes up to april 2013 .",
    "a synthesis of the literature for the bike sharing systems was given by fishman et al .",
    "@xcite and labadi et al .",
    "@xcite . at the same time , for some countries or cities developing the bike sharing systems , readers may refer to , such as , europe , the americas and asia by shaheen et al .",

    "a crucial question is the ability not only to meet the fluctuating demand for renting bikes at each station but also to provide enough vacant lockers to allow the renters to return the bikes at their destinations . since the number of bikes packed in each station is always",
    "randomly dynamically changed , this causes an unpredictable imbalance , such as , some stations contain more bikes but the others are seriously short of available bikes .",
    "such a randomly dynamic unbalance of bikes distributed among the stations often leads to occurrence of the problematic stations ( i.e. , full or empty stations ) .",
    "notice that the problematic stations reflect a common challenge faced by the bike sharing systems in practice due to the stochastic and time - inhomogeneous nature of both the customer arrivals and the bike returns , thus the probability of problematic stations has been regarded as a main factor to measure the satisfaction of customers and even to estimate the quality of service .",
    "obviously , how to effectively reduce the probability of problematic stations becomes a key way to improve the satisfaction of customers and further to promote the quality of system service .",
    "therefore , it is a major task to develop effective methods for computing the probability of problematic stations in the study of bike sharing systems .",
    "queueing theory and markov processes are very useful for computing the probability of problematic stations , and more generally , analyzing performance measures of the bike sharing systems .",
    "however , available works on such a research line are still fewer up to now .",
    "we would like to refer readers to four classes of recent literature as follows . *",
    "( a ) simple queues : * leurent @xcite used the @xmath0 queue to study a vehicle - sharing system in which each station contains an additional waiting room which helps those customers arriving at a problematic station , and analyzed performance measures of this system in terms of a geometric distribution .",
    "schuijbroek et al .",
    "@xcite evaluated the service level by means of the transient distribution of the @xmath0 queue , and the service level is used to establish some optimal models to discuss the inventory rebalancing and vehicle routing .",
    "raviv et al @xcite and raviv and kolka @xcite employed the transient distribution of a time - inhomogeneous @xmath1 queue to compute the expected number of bike shortages at each station . *",
    "( b ) the mean - field theory : * fricker et al .",
    "@xcite considered a space inhomogeneous bike sharing system with different clusters , and expressed the minimal proportion of problematic stations within each cluster . for a space homogeneous bike sharing system , fricker and",
    "gast @xcite used the @xmath2 queue to provide a more detailed analysis for some simple mean - field models ( including the _ power of two choices _ ) , derived a closed - form solution to the minimal proportion of problematic stations , and compared the incentives and redistribution mechanisms .",
    "fricker and tibi @xcite studied the central limit and local limit theorems for the independent ( perhaps non identically distributed ) random variables which effectively support analysis of a generalized jackson network with product - form solution ; and used these obtained results to evaluate performance measures of the space inhomogeneous bike sharing systems , where its asymptotics gives a complete picture for equilibrium state analysis of the locally space homogeneous bike sharing systems .",
    "@xcite provided a mean - field queueing method to study a large - scale bike sharing system through using a combination of , such as , the virtual time - inhomogeneous queue , the mean - field equations , the martingale limit , the nonlinear birth - death process , numerical computation of the fixed point , and numerical analysis for the steady state probability of the problematic stations . * ( c ) queueing networks : * savin et al .",
    "@xcite used a loss network as well as admission control to discuss capacity allocation of a rental model with two classes of customers , and studied the revenue management and fleet sizing decision in the rental system .",
    "adelman @xcite applied a closed queueing network to set up an internal pricing mechanism for managing a fleet of service units , and also used a nonlinear flow model to discuss the price - based policy for the vehicle redistribution .",
    "george and xia @xcite provided a queueing network method in the study of vehicle rental systems , and determined the optimal number of parking spaces for each rental location . * ( d ) markov decision processes : * stochastic optimization and markov decision processes are applied to analysis of the bike sharing systems . from a dynamic price mechanism , waserhole and",
    "jost @xcite used the closed queuing networks to propose a markov decision model of a bike sharing system . to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the markov decision process with a high dimension , they established a fluid approximation that computes a static policy and gave an upper bound on the potential optimization .",
    "such a fluid approximation for the markov decision processes of the bike sharing systems was further developed in waserhole and jost @xcite @xcite and waserhole et al .",

    "the main purposes of this paper are to provide a unified framework for analyzing closed queueing networks in the study of bike sharing systems .",
    "this framework of closed queueing networks is interesting , difficult and challenging from three crucial features : ( a ) stations and roads have very different physical attributes , but all of them are abstracted as indistinguishable nodes in the closed queueing networks ; ( b ) the service discipline of the stations is first come first service ( abbreviated as fcfs ) , while the service discipline of the roads is processor sharing ( abbreviated as ps ) ; and ( c ) the virtual customers ( i.e. , bikes ) in the stations are of a single class , while the virtual customers ( i.e. , bikes ) in the roads are of two classes , and their classes may change on the roads according to the first bike - return or the at least two successive bike - returns due to the full stations , respectively .",
    "for such a closed queueing network , this paper provides a detailed analysis both for establishing a product - form solution to the steady state joint probabilities of queue lengths , and for computing the steady state probability of problematic stations , more generally , for analyzing performance measures of the bike sharing system .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are twofold .",
    "the first contribution is to describe a large - scale bike sharing system and to provide a unified framework for analyzing closed queueing networks through establishing some basic factors : the service rates from stations or roads ; and the routing matrix as well as the relative arrival rates to stations or roads .",
    "notice that the basic factors play a key role in the study of closed queueing networks .",
    "the second contribution of this paper is to provide a product - form solution to the steady state joint probabilities of queue lengths in the closed queueing network , and give performance analysis of the bike sharing system in terms of the steady state joint probabilities .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe a large - scale bike sharing system with @xmath3 different stations and with at most @xmath4 different roads . in section 3",
    ", we provide a unified framework for analyzing closed queueing networks in the study of bike sharing systems , and also compute the service rates , the routing matrix , and the relative arrival rates . in section 4 , we give a product - form solution to the steady state joint probabilities of queue lengths in the closed queueing network , and analyze performance measures of the bike sharing system by means of the steady state joint probabilities .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we describe a large - scale bike sharing system with @xmath3 different stations and with at most @xmath4 different roads due to the riding - bike directed connection between any two stations .",
    "to analyze such a bike sharing system , we provide a unified framework for analyzing closed queueing networks in the study of bike sharing systems .",
    "in a large - scale bike sharing system , a customer arrives at a station , rents a bike , and uses it for a while ; then she returns the bike to a destination station , and immediately leaves this system .",
    "obviously , for any customer renting and using a bike , her first return - bike time is different from those return - bike times that she has successively returned the bike for at least two times due to arriving at the full stations . at the same time",
    ", it is easy to understand that for any customer , her first road selection as well as her first riding - bike speed are different from those of having successively returned her bike for at least two times .",
    "also , it is noted that the customer must return her bike to a station , then she can immediately leave the bike sharing system .",
    "now , we describe the bike sharing system , including operation mechanism , system parameters and mathematical notation , as follows :    * ( 1 ) stations and roads : * there are @xmath3 different stations and at most @xmath4 different roads , where the @xmath4 roads are observed from the fact that there must exist a directed road from a station to another station . in addition , we assume that at the initial time @xmath5 , every station has @xmath6 bikes and @xmath7 parking places , where @xmath8 ; and @xmath9 , which makes that some of the @xmath10 bikes can result in at least a full station .    *",
    "( 2 ) customer arrival process : * the arrivals of the outside customers at the @xmath11th station are a poisson process with arrival rate @xmath12 for @xmath13 .    *",
    "( 3 ) the first riding - bike time : * once an outside customer arrives at the @xmath11th station , she immediately goes to rent a bike .",
    "if there is no bike in the @xmath11th station ( i.e. , the @xmath11th station is empty ) , then the customer directly leaves this bike sharing system .",
    "if there is at least one bike in the @xmath11th station , then the customer rents a bike , and then goes to road @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that for @xmath15 with @xmath16 , the customer at the @xmath11th station rides the bike into road @xmath14 with probability @xmath17 for @xmath18 ; and her riding - bike time from the @xmath11th station to the @xmath19th station ( i.e. , riding on road @xmath14 ) is an exponential random variable with riding - bike rate @xmath20 , where the expected riding - bike time is @xmath21 .    *",
    "( 4 ) the bike return times : *     when the customer completes her short trip on the above road @xmath14 ( see assumption ( 3 ) ) , she needs to return her bike to the @xmath19th station . if there is at least one available parking position ( i.e. , a vacant docker ) , then the customer directly returns her bike to the @xmath19th station , and immediately leaves this bike sharing system .    ",
    "if no parking position is available at the @xmath19th station , then she has to ride the bike to another station @xmath22 with probability @xmath23 for @xmath24 for @xmath25 ; and her riding - bike time from the @xmath19th station to the @xmath22th station ( i.e. , riding on road @xmath26 ) is an exponential random variable with riding - bike rate @xmath27 . if there is at least one available parking position , then the customer directly returns her bike to the @xmath22th station , and immediately leaves this bike sharing system .    ",
    "if no parking position is available at the @xmath22th station , then she has to ride the bike to another station @xmath28 with probability @xmath29 for @xmath30 for @xmath31 ; and her riding - bike time from the @xmath22th station to the @xmath28th station ( i.e. , riding on road @xmath32 ) is an exponential random variable with riding - bike rate @xmath33 . if there is at least one available parking position , then the customer directly returns her bike to the @xmath28th station , and immediately leaves this bike sharing system .",
    " we assume that this bike has not been returned at any station yet through @xmath34 consecutive return processes . in this case ,",
    "the customer has to try her ( @xmath35)st lucky return .",
    "notice that the customer goes to the @xmath36th station from the @xmath37th full station with probability @xmath38 for @xmath39 for @xmath40 ; and her riding - bike time from the @xmath37th station to the @xmath36th station ( i.e. , riding on road @xmath41 ) is an exponential random variable with riding - bike rate @xmath42 .",
    "if there is at least one available parking position , then the customer directly returns her bike to the @xmath36th station , and immediately leaves this bike sharing system ; otherwise she has to continuously try another station again .",
    "we further assume that the returning - bike process is persistent in the sense that the customer must find a station with an empty position to return her bike , because the bike is the public property so that no one can make it her own .",
    "it is seen from the above description that the parameters : @xmath17 and @xmath43 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , of the first return , may be different from the parameters : @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , of the @xmath34th return for @xmath46 .",
    "notice that such an assumption with respect to these different parameters is actually reasonable because the customer possibly has more things ( for example , tourism , shopping , visiting friends and so on ) in the first return process , but she become to have only one return task during the @xmath34 successive return processes for @xmath46 .",
    "* ( 5 ) the departure discipline : * the customer departure has two different cases : ( a ) an outside customer directly leaves the bike sharing system if she arrives at an empty station ; or ( b ) if one customer rents and uses a bike , and she finally returns the bike to a station , then the customer completes her trip , and immediately leaves the bike sharing system .",
    "we assume that the customer arrival and riding - bike processes are independent , and also all the above random variables are independent of each other .",
    "for such a bike sharing system , figure 1 provides some physical interpretation .",
    "in this section , we first provide a closed queueing network to express the bike sharing system , as seen in figure 1 .",
    "then we determine the service rates , the routing matrix , and the relative arrival rates of the closed queueing network .",
    "notice that there are two classes of customers in the @xmath47 roads .",
    "in the bike sharing system described in the above section , there are @xmath10 bikes , @xmath3 stations and @xmath4 roads .",
    "now , we abstract the bike sharing system as a closed queueing network as follows :    * ( 1 ) virtual nodes : * : :    although the stations and roads have different physical attributes    such as functions , and geographical topologies , the stations and roads    are all regarded as the same nodes in the closed queueing network . * ( 2 ) virtual customers : * : :    the bikes at the stations or roads are described as follows :    the virtual customers are abstracted by the bikes , which are either parked in the stations or ridden on the roads .",
    "notice that the total number of bikes in the bike sharing system is fixed as @xmath10 due to the fact that bikes can neither enter nor leave this system , thus the bike sharing system can be regarded as a closed queueing network .",
    "from assumption ( 2 ) in section 2 , it is seen that there are only one class of customers in the nodes abstracted from the stations . from assumptions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in section 2",
    ", we understand that there are two different classes of customers in the nodes abstracted from the roads , where the first class of customers are the bikes ridden on the roads for the first time ; while the second class of customers are the bikes which are successively ridden on the at least two different roads due to the full station .",
    "( 3 ) service disciplines : : :    the first come first service ( or fcfs ) is used in the nodes abstracted    from the stations ; while a new processor sharing ( or ps ) is used in    the nodes abstracted from the roads .    in the above",
    "closed queueing network , let @xmath48  be the number of bikes parked in @xmath11th station at time @xmath49 for @xmath13 , and @xmath50 the number of bikes of class @xmath51 ridden on road @xmath52 at time @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "where for @xmath13@xmath58 obviously , @xmath59 is a markov process of size @xmath60 due to the exponential and poisson assumptions of this bike sharing system .",
    "now , we describe the state space of the markov process @xmath61 . it is seen from section 2 that@xmath62@xmath63 and@xmath64 from ( [ cequ-1 ] ) to ( [ cequ-3 ] ) , it is seen the state space of markov process @xmath59 of size @xmath60 is given by@xmath65 where@xmath66 and for @xmath13@xmath67 notice that @xmath68 is the total number of bikes being ridden on road @xmath52 for @xmath69 with @xmath56 , and also the state space @xmath70 contains @xmath71 elements .    to compute the steady state joint probabilities of @xmath60 queue lengths in the bike sharing system ,",
    "it is seen from chapter 7 in bolch et al .",
    "@xcite that we need to determine the service rate , the routing matrix and the relative arrival rate for each node in the closed queueing network .    *",
    "( a ) the service rates *    from figure 2 , it is seen that the service rates of the closed queueing network are given from two different cases as follows :        _ case one : the node is one of the _ @xmath3 _ stations _",
    "the departure process of bikes from the @xmath11th station , renting at the @xmath11th station and immediately ridden on one of the @xmath72 roads ( such as , road @xmath73 for @xmath74 with @xmath75 ) , is poisson with service rate@xmath76 by means of the condition : @xmath77 .",
    "_ case two : the node is one of the _",
    "@xmath4 _ roads _    in this case , two different processor sharing queueing processes of road @xmath73 ( with two classes of different customers ) are explained in figure 2 .",
    "now , we describe the service rates with respect to the two classes of different customers as follows :    the departure process of bikes from road @xmath73 , rented from station @xmath11 and being ridden on road @xmath73 for the first time , is poisson with service rate@xmath78    the departure process of bikes from road @xmath73 , having successively been ridden on the roads for at least two times but now on road @xmath73 , is poisson with service rate@xmath79    * ( b ) the routing matrix and the relative arrival rates *    now , we compute the relative arrival rate of each node in the closed queueing network . differently from the service rates analyzed above ,",
    "it is more complicated to determine the relative arrival rates by means of the routing matrix .",
    "based on chapter 7 in bolch et al .",
    "@xcite , we denote by @xmath80 and @xmath81 the relative arrival rates of the @xmath11th station with @xmath82 parking bikes , and of road @xmath73 with @xmath83 riding bikes of class @xmath51 ,  respectively .",
    "we write@xmath84 where@xmath85 and for @xmath13@xmath86    now , we introduce two useful notations : @xmath87 and @xmath88 as follows :    @xmath89 : :    a unit row vector of size @xmath60 , which    is given by a method of replacing elements from    @xmath90 to    @xmath87 , that is , corresponding to the    row vector @xmath90 , the element    @xmath82 is replaced by one , while all other elements of    the vector @xmath91 are replaced by zeros .",
    "@xmath92 : :    a unit row vector of size @xmath60 , which    is given by a method of replacing elements from    @xmath90 to    @xmath88 , that is ,    corresponding to the row vector @xmath90 , the    element @xmath93 is replaced by one ,    while all other elements of the vector    @xmath90 are replaced by zeros .    to compute the vector @xmath94 , we first need to give the routing matrix @xmath95 of the closed queueing network as follows:@xmath96 where the routing matrix @xmath95 is of order @xmath71 , and the element @xmath97",
    "is computed from the following three cases :    _ case one : from a station to a road _    for @xmath98 with @xmath74 , we observe a transition route from the @xmath11th station to road @xmath73 .",
    "if a rented bike leaves the @xmath11th station and enters road @xmath73 , then @xmath99 , and there is a two - element change : @xmath100 .",

    "in the former case ( the riding bike of class @xmath51 enters the @xmath11th station if @xmath107 ) , we obtain that for @xmath107 , there is a two - element change : @xmath109 , hence this gives that for @xmath107@xmath110 since the end of road @xmath106 is only the @xmath11th station .",
