    "this phenomenological picture can also justify a non - monotonous dependence of mean magnetization on the temperature when @xmath63 .",

    "in summary we have demonstrated that the finite system size and initial conditions can lead to the emergence of a non - monotonous dependence of the mean magnetization on system s temperature in a growing one - dimensional ising model with quenched spins .",
    "the effect exists only for magnetic fields smaller than the value of the spin coupling constant and the crossover temperature decays to zero very slowly with the system size . using markov chain theory we have developed an analytical approach to this phenomenon that well fits numerical simulations .",
    "the effect can be understood as a competition between thermal fluctuations and the influence of the initial condition that fixes orientation of spins in the first cluster .",
    "the crossover temperature can be explained as the point where the initial ordered cluster ( domain ) is no longer dominant thanks to thermal fluctuations , yet the temperature did not lower much the average magnetization toward zero .",
    "the effect exists also when spins are not quenched but fully thermalized after the attachment to the chain .",

    "<S> we introduce a growing one - dimensional quenched spin model that bases on asymmetrical one - side ising interactions in the presence of external field . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations and analytical calculations based on markov chain theory show that when the external field is smaller than the exchange coupling constant @xmath0 there is a non - monotonous dependence of the mean magnetization on the temperature in a finite system . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover temperature @xmath1 corresponding to the maximal magnetization decays with system size , approximately as the inverse of the w lambert function . </S>",
    "<S> the observed phenomenon can be understood as an interplay between the thermal fluctuations and the presence of the first cluster determined by initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the effect exists also when spins are not quenched but fully thermalized after the attachment to the chain . </S>",
    "<S> we conceive the model is suitable for a qualitative description of online emotional discussions arranged in a chronological order , where a spin in every node conveys emotional valence of a subsequent post . </S>"
