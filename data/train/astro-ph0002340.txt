    "[ [ section ] ]    the toronto red - sequence cluster survey ( trcs ) is a major new observational effort designed to identify and characterize a large sample of galaxy clusters to redshifts as high as @xmath12 . when completed , the trcs will be the largest imaging survey ever completed on 4 m telescopes , and",
    "will provide a large and homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters for detailed follow - up study .",
    "the basic survey is envisioned as 100 deg@xmath10 of 2 filter ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) imaging , to a depth which is @xmath42 mag past @xmath5 at @xmath6 in both filters .",
    "the design of the survey is based on a new method for identifying galaxy clusters ( gladders & yee 2000a ) developed specifically for the trcs . in brief",
    ", this method searches for clustering in the 5-d space of : x - y positions , @xmath13 color , @xmath2 mag , and morphology in the form of a concentration index .",
    "the x - y positions provide the surface density enhancement .",
    "a color slice in the color - mag plane provides separation in @xmath14 space via the _ red sequence _ of early - type galaxies in clusters ( figure 1 ) and increases the s / n of density enhancements .",
    "morphology allows us to key onto early - type galaxies , the primary population in cluster centers .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the trcs is being driven by two major scientific goals .",
    "the first is based on the theoretical prediction that the evolution of the mass - spectrum of galaxy clusters with redshift , @xmath9 , should be a strong function of two cosmological parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the goal is to use the clusters identified in the survey to measure @xmath9 directly from the survey data .",
    "redshift can be estimated from the color of red sequence ( e.g. , lpez - cruz & yee 2000 ) , and the mass of each cluster can be estimated from its richness , as measured by the parameter @xmath15 ( e.g. , yee & lpez - cruz 1999 ) .",
    "the second major scientific goal is a study of the cluster galaxy populations , which can be done using the trcs for the first time with a complete sample . the definition of a complete , or volume limited , sample is derived from extensive simulations of the survey selection functions .      [ [ section-2 ] ]    any detailed understanding of the cosmological or galaxy evolution results deriving from the trcs requires a good understanding of the survey selection functions .",
    "specifically , we wish to know how well the cluster - finding algorithm finds clusters of various sorts ( as described by various parameters ) . to this end",
    ", we have constructed a number of cluster and field simulations ( gladders & yee 2000b ) to directly test the algorithm .",
    "a large suite of possible clusters have been tested ; the parameters describing the clusters are given in table 1 .",
    "the results of this process demonstrate that the trcs should be complete for all reasonable clusters of abell richness class @xmath16 1 clusters ( @xmath17 km s@xmath18 ) to at least @xmath19 .",
    ".cluster model parameters used to test the cluster finding algorithm as applied to the trcs . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the first run for the trcs occurred at cfht in may , 1999 .",
    "a total of 21 pointings were acquired with the cfh12k camera , with each pointing covering 0.272 deg@xmath10 .",
    "the bulk of the images have seeing better than 07 , with some as good 05 . at the time of writing ,",
    "the total trcs dataset consists of about 35 deg@xmath10 of data . however , the results presented below are based on only the first 6 deg@xmath10 .",
    "figure 3 shows a rich ( @xmath20 ) , compact cluster at photometric redshift of @xmath21 ( left panel ) .",
    "the cluster appears to be embedded in a large    filamentary structure ( @xmath410 h@xmath18 mpc long ) traced out by red galaxies ( center panel ) .",
    "the excess is undetectable without a color cut ( right panel ) .",
    "the efficacy of color information in isolating high-@xmath14 structures is obvious .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    figure 4 shows the cores of several other rich clusters , one of which appears to have a gravitational arc .",
    "the success of the trcs in finding rich , high - z cluster candidates in the few degrees searched so far implies that the total survey will contain several hundred @xmath22 cluster candidates , a preliminary result which is supportive of a low - density , high normalization cosmological model .",
    "the trcs dataset is also well suited for a number of other detailed studies . for example , preliminary work has already revealed a significant population of extremely red ( @xmath23 ) point sources .",
    "such objects are likely l and t dwarfs , with some contamination by @xmath24 qsos .",
    "other studies are possible using the survey data , e.g. studies of cluster lensing ( strong and weak ) , cosmic shear , halo structure , low surface brightness galaxies and early - type galaxy correlations ."
