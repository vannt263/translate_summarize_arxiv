    "semiconductor leds and their counterpart solar cells are expected to play a major role in general lightning and renewable energy production .",
    "the development of organic light emitting diodes ( oled ) has proven to be successful and they are on the market , notwithstanding the disadvantages of a poor carrier injection and transport properties compared to inorganic semiconductors . an idea to further improve such devices",
    "is the use of an hybrid system that would combine the best properties of both materials together and potentially open new possibilities for optoelectronic devices@xcite . in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "novel hybrid quasiparticles are formed , with properties diverse from those of the individual excitons leading to new uses in particular those requiring large nonlinearities as for optical switching . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "in which wannier and frenkel excitons maintain their individuality , a suitable use of each component would also bring new features@xcite and could overcome the drawback presented earlier .",
    "for instance , carriers are electrically injected , transported and bound into excitons in the inorganic semiconductor subsystem , this latter being coupled to an organic light emitting subsystem via a frster energy transfer process@xcite .",
    "this internal non - radiative energy transfer had been proposed and has been recently demonstrated to be efficient enough ( see ref . for a review of relevant work ) .",
    "following early theoretical predictions@xcite , the energy transfer process has been observed from a quantum well to a quantum dot overlayer@xcite , and from a quantum well to an organic overlayer@xcite .",
    "a way to further improve the transfer between both components is the use of a plasmonic resonance to enhance the electric field in the system and take advantage of the metallic cathode which is often mandatory in electrical devices .",
    "indeed the electrodes are often responsible of parasitic and strong waveguiding , a considerable energy is trapped in the surface plasmon mode then the recovery of some of this energy becomes then of interest@xcite    we deal here with such hybrid systems structured in a planar geometry whereby a wannier exciton in an inorganic semiconductor quantum well plays the role of the donor and a frenkel exciton in a crystalline organic overlayer that of the acceptor .",
    "we study the role of an intermediate metallic layer that will carry the excitation through plasmons from the inorganic part to the organic .",
    "moreover , we take into account retardation in the model and the possible quenching effects of the organic emission due to the metal layer .    in section [ model ] , we describe the theory of frster energy transfer in a planar hybrid nanostructure taking into due account plasmonic excitations and retardation . in section [ diel ] ,",
    "we use parameter values of typical hybrid structures to calculate the transfer rate for various configurations .",
    "we discuss the role of the plasmonic enhancement of the transfer and the additional loss channels introduced by the metal .",
    "we consider here the planar architecture shown in fig.[schema ] .",
    "the donor subsystem consists of a semiconductor quantum well of thickness @xmath0 sandwiched between two semiconductor barriers of thickness @xmath1 . for simplicity , we take the same background dielectric constant @xmath2 for the well and the barriers and we assume the barriers to be infinitely high ( i.e. , the wannier exciton is fully contained in the well region ) . at the bottom ( @xmath3 ) lies a transparent glass substrate with dielectric constant @xmath4 . at the top",
    "lies a metallic layer described by his complex dielectric constant @xmath5 , a spacer layer with constant @xmath6 and then ( @xmath7 ) lies the acceptor subsystem consisting of a crystalline organic medium with complex dielectric constant @xmath8 and thickness @xmath9 followed by air .",
    "the bottom glass and the air parts are supposed to be semi - infinite .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 include only the contribution of higher resonances ( with respect to the exciton energies under consideration ) and we consider them to be real .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the total dielectric function of the organic material , including in particular the resonant absorption due to the frenkel excitons , and thus it is a complex valued tensor @xcite , which however is assumed here isotropic for simplicity .",
    "the complex dielectric constant @xmath13 also accounts for the metal losses .",
    "here we extend the theoretical framework for the frster energy transfer rate in a hybrid nanostructure developed in references , and discussed in detail in reference , to take into account retardation effects as well as plasmonic resonances .",
    "the former approach is equivalent to the usual frster theory based on the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite and leads to a macroscopic , semiclassical description of the energy transfer .",
    "its main advantage is that the acceptor subsystem enters the calculation only via its complex ( frequency dependent ) dielectric tensor , a quantity directly accessible by experiment . in short",
    ", the transfer rate is obtained from the joule losses suffered in the organic medium by the electric field induced by the quantum well exciton , through the metal .",
    "this is appropriate to the weak coupling regime between donor and acceptor and occurs when the linewidth of the acceptor resonance is large compared to the interaction coupling donor and acceptor , leading to an irreversible energy transfer .",
    "moreover , as the linewidth of 2d excitons in inorganic quantum wells are typically at least one order of magnitude smaller than the linewidth of the organic material excitons , we employ for simplicity a delta function approximation for the emission spectrum of the donor subsystem . as a matter of fact",
    ", the presence of the wannier exciton of energy @xmath14 gives rise to a source term in the quantum well corresponding to the exciton polarization oscillating at frequency @xmath15 which can be written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the matrix element of the electric dipole moment between the bloch functions of the conduction and valence band extrema and @xmath18 is the envelope function describing the bound electron - hole pair ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the electron and hole coordinates ) . in our simple model of a 2d wannier - mott exciton",
    ", the polarization is given by the product of the @xmath21-wave function of the 2d relative motion of the electron - hole pair with the lowest subband envelope functions of electron and hole ( which are equal in the approximation of infinitely deep well ) and with the plane - wave function of the center - of - mass motion .",
    "this description is only appropriate to coherent large radius excitons with a well defined center of mass wavevector , as usually occur in high quality inorganic semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "taking into account their corresponding normalization we can write : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the in - plane normalization area , @xmath24 the in - plane wave vector of the center - of - mass motion , @xmath25 the in - plane component of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the 2d exciton bohr radius .    then , differently from previous work ( ref . , ) , we look for the electric field @xmath28 resulting from this polarization calculated from maxwell s equations with the use of transfer matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the dielectric tensor @xmath29 is piecewise constant corresponding to each different layer , see fig.[schema ] .",
    "we choose it to be complex in the organic layer and the metal to described the absorption and losses in these material , and real in the inorganic part , as the background absorption is supposed to be higher in energy , and for the rest of the system .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions at the interfaces are the continuity of the tangential electric field and of the normal electric displacement between each layer .",
    "knowing the electric field , we can calculate the transfer rate ( inverse transfer time ) of the excitation into the organic medium : @xmath30 this expression is equivalent to applying the fermi golden rule to the decay of one excited state in the quantum well into the excited states of the organic molecules in the linear regime approximation ( for a derivation of eq.[taugene ] in terms of a microscopic inelastic scattering rate of wannier excitons due to resonant two - level molecules in the organic medium see ref . ) . in eq.[taugene ] , and elsewhere below , the acceptor dielectric permittivity is evaluated at the frequency @xmath15 of the delta - like emission spectrum of the donor .",
    "the power @xmath31 dissipated in the organic layer is given by @xmath32 .",
    "such energy transfer mechanism , in the non - radiative approximation and without considering metallic layer , have been shown to be fast enough to efficiently quench the wannier exciton luminescence and to turn on the organic molecule light emission @xcite .",
    "due to the in - plane translational symmetry of the source ( we are dealing with free excitons in the well ) , we consider the polarization for a given in - plane wave vector . in this case",
    "three modes of different symmetry can be identified : longitudinal ( l ) where @xmath17 is along the in - plane wave vector , perpendicular ( z ) where the dipole moment is oriented along the z - axis , and transverse ( t ) for which the polarization is orthogonal to the two first cases .",
    "for each one , the exciton polarization ( [ polarization ] ) gives rise to an electric field in the quantum well and then in all the structure .",
    "to calculate this latter , we determine for all three cases the source term to be included in the transfer matrix theory , as detailed below . with @xmath33",
    "we can write for the te mode : @xmath34   \\\\",
    "b_z(z ) & = \\frac{ck}{\\omega } \\left [ a_+^s(z_0 ) e^{iq(z - z_0 ) } + a_-^s(z_0 ) e^{-iq(z - z_0 ) } \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the tm mode : @xmath35   \\\\",
    "e_z(z ) & = \\frac{ck}{\\varepsilon \\omega } \\left [ a_+^p(z_0 ) e^{iq(z - z_0 ) } + a_-^p(z_0 ) e^{-iq(z - z_0 ) } \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the polarization .",
    "the amplitude @xmath38 from each side of a dielectric slab of thickness d are linked by @xmath39 with @xmath40 at an interface between @xmath41 et @xmath42 we have @xmath43 with @xmath44 considering a slab that include a source of field , as the quantum well considered here , a particular solution of maxwell equations in the active domain leads to a source term @xmath23 for the amplitude .",
    "the relation of the amplitude at both ends is @xmath45 where @xmath23 is related to the electric field at the border due to the intrinsic polarization distribution ( [ pol ] ) and @xmath46 is the matrix element for the whole slab , constituted by the matrix that we have previously seen , for a slab of thickness @xmath47 and dielectric permittivity @xmath42 sandwiched between two medias of permittivity @xmath41 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath23 is given by the continuity relations of the fields at each interface .",
    "for @xmath36 and @xmath37 polarizations , writing @xmath50 and @xmath51 we obtain : @xmath52 \\label{sources } \\\\",
    "\\nonumber s^p & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\bigg [ \\left (   \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_2}{ck } e_z(z_- ) -   \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_1}{ck } e_l(z_- ) \\\\ \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_2}{ck } e_z(z_- ) +   \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_1}{ck } e_l(z_- )   \\end{array } \\right ) \\\\ & -m_{\\varepsilon_1 | \\varepsilon_2}^p m_{d }   \\left (   \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_2}{ck } e_z(z_+ ) -   \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_1}{ck } e_l(z_+ ) \\\\ \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_2}{ck } e_z(z_+ ) +   \\frac{\\omega \\varepsilon_1}{ck } e_l(z_+ )   \\end{array } \\right )   \\bigg ] \\label{sourcep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fields @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the electric fields at the border of the active domain .",
    "so starting from the polarization term ( [ polarization ] ) , we solve maxwell equations to find a particular solution in the quantum well domain .",
    "the field at the border will be used to find the general solution in the whole structure , giving a source term for the transfer matrix theory ( ( [ sources ] ) and ( [ sourcep ] ) ) .",
    "choosing a symmetric particular solution according to the well width , the electric field is : @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "that lead to the matrix elements ( [ sources ] ) and ( [ sourcep ] ) to be use : @xmath59 where the first row correspond to the traveling waves from the bottom to the top in fig.[schema ] , and the second row to the waves traveling in the opposite direction .",
    "from here it is straightforward to determine the electric field in the whole structure and then the transfer rate to the organic media ( [ taugene ] ) .",
    "we also determine the losses in the process which compete with the energy transfer described by @xmath60 .",
    "the main channel will be the dissipation in the metal @xmath61 : @xmath62 and the direct radiative emissions @xmath63 ( as the final interest is the light emitted from the organic part ) given by the flux of the poynting vector in the @xmath64direction in any section of the final layers , glass or air , as we consider them semi - infinite here : @xmath65 we also consider a non - radiative channel of dissipation @xmath66 intrinsic to the well , independent of the @xmath67vector , that will be estimated @xcite and is of the order a few hundreds of picoseconds .",
    "we will discuss below the dependency with the @xmath67vector , however in most cases of experimental interest , the transfer rate for an exciton distribution ( rather than that for one specific exciton ) should be considered via averaging over the initial state of the donor subsystem .",
    "we assume , in particular , that all directions for the center of mass wave vector of the exciton in the well are equiprobable ( i.e. , the exciton distribution has cylindrical symmetry ) . for a thermalized population of quantum well excitons ,",
    "each one having a well defined center of mass wavevector , we also average over the energy @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the exciton mass , according to the boltzmann distribution , assuming that the wavevector dependent energy transfer itself is not fast enough to modify such exciton distribution . in the case of 2d excitons ,",
    "the wave - vectors amplitude distribution is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "we also neglect here for simplicity the effects on the energy transfer efficiency of the dynamic ionization - recombination equilibrium between excitons and electron - hole unbound pairs which has recently been considered for gaas based quantum wells @xcite and that should be less important in ii - vi based quantum wells having a higher exciton binding energy .",
    "after the excitation is transfered to the organic part , we have to consider the emission of this latter to evaluate the quenching due to the metal layer .",
    "we use the same approach as previously except a few details : as the bohr radius of the frenkel exciton is much smaller than the typical size of the layer , of the order of one molecule , we consider the emission from an assembly of point dipoles . the transfer by a point dipole at a given position @xmath72 inside the organic layer",
    "can be described using the preceding theoretical framework considering a sum over all @xmath73-vectors for an infinitely fine layer of emitters situated at the same position @xmath72 . for each value of the @xmath73-vector",
    "the layer is defined by @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 which are the limit of ( [ sources ] ) and ( [ sourcep ] ) when the width of the well is going to zero , with @xmath77 replaced by @xmath78 for the point molecule , and @xmath79 replaced by @xmath80 to take into account the local field effect .",
    "we neglect the absorption due to the quantum well as the emission time for the organic is shorter than the transfer time to the quantum well , plus stockes shift ( weak coupling regime @xcite ) .",
    "from there , after integration , we obtain the electric field in the whole structure for a given molecule at position @xmath72 and then the radiative emission from the top @xmath81 , and the losses : the dissipation in the metal @xmath82 and the emission at the bottom in the glass side @xmath83 .",
    "we integrate on all positions @xmath72 inside the organic to get the transfer rate from the assembly of molecules .",
    "the initial excitation of each molecule is proportional to the energy transfered from the inorganic quantum well that reach its position .",
    "the detail of the spatial repartition of the energy in the organic before the reemission of that latter is strongly dependent of the material and is out of the scope of this article @xcite .",
    "we consider here the two limiting cases of a weak and strong diffusion of the frenkel exciton .",
    "if we can neglect the diffusion then the excitation is proportional to the square of the electric field at the point of the molecule ( the integrand of eq.([taugene ] ) ) , on the contrary for strong diffusion the energy spread in the whole layer and the excitation is independent of the position and proportional to @xmath60 ( [ taugene ] ) .",
    "the plasmonic resonance will increase the transfer rate to the organic but also induce losses , that have to be evaluated so we detail the efficiency of the transfer @xmath84 and the efficiency of the organic emission @xmath85 .",
    "this latter is different for weak and strong diffusion hypothesis .",
    "the two processes being independent , the internal efficiency @xmath86 will be the product of the two quantities .",
    "the total efficiency of the device , that take into account the out - coupling of the light and the injection process , will not be studied here .",
    "@xmath87    the explicit analytic form of the obtained results is much more cumbersome than in previous theoretical work @xcite , due to the more complex geometry including the metal layer and the retardation effects taken into account here . in the following we will then only discuss the results numerically .",
    "in fig.[compa ] we show the results of ref .",
    "( dashed lines ) together with the transfer rate obtained with the full calculation including retardation effects described above ( plain lines ) , for the different possible polarizations of the exciton at the energy emission of the znse well @xmath88 and thickness of the organic layer of @xmath89 . in the large @xmath73 values , where retardation effects can be neglected",
    ", we see that both model coincide . for small @xmath73 values corresponding to the radiative part",
    "the behavior is largely affected .",
    "the @xmath90-polarized exciton transfer rate show a plateau the value of which depends on the thickness of the organic layer , as the propagating modes penetrate all the layer .",
    "the @xmath91-polarization transfer rate shows a similar behavior in the non - radiative regime , but goes to zero when going to normal incidence ( @xmath92 ) this is a simple geometric effects as in this case there is no electric field at the interface ( see eq.([ewz ] ) ) .",
    "we also notice a transfer from @xmath93-polarized exciton , mostly in the radiative range .",
    "this latter is null if we take only into account the non - radiative part , as in this case it does not give rise to any charge distribution nor electric field . in between these two regimes , the position and intensity of the peak",
    "is slightly modified and depends on the absorber thickness .",

    "dashed lines are the exciton s transfer rate without retardation for @xmath90-polarization ( blue ) and @xmath91-polarization ( red ) .",
    "the geometry here consist of a znte quantum well sandwiched between two layers of acceptor as in ref . .",
    "the vertical lines are @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath4 is the relative permittivity of the glass substrate.,width=302 ]    we turn now to the complete geometry of fig.[schema ] including the metallic layer . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we will focus on the effects of the plasmons and thus only change the overlayer configuration keeping all the rest of the heterostructure fixed .",
    "we take into account a simplified description of the organic with only one exciton and we discuss only the @xmath90-polarization state in the quantum well .",
    "the @xmath91-polarization presents the same behavior in the non - radiative part of the spectrum , however the transfer is killed when we approach orthogonal incidence ( @xmath73=0 ) , and the transverse polarization has a low transfer , only noticeable in the intermediate region with no effect of the plasmon . for the donor subsystem , we take a znte semiconductor quantum well for which @xmath96 , @xmath97 where @xmath27 is taken to be @xmath98 @xcite ( note that in a quantum well this value is half the one of the bulk ) and @xmath99 @xcite where @xmath100 is the electron mass . for the structure , we take @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , while the glass substrate and the air top layer are semi - infinite in the z - direction@xcite .",
    "the organic medium is tetracene which absorption match the znte emission@xcite .",
    "we assume that even close to the interface the power transferred to the organic medium does not lead to any saturation effect .",
    "thus , the organic medium can be considered to be in the ground state and can be described by its linear dielectric response . in simple cases , it is possible to use an effective model @xcite , typically near the exciton resonances , where the optical response is modeled by a real background constant and several lorentz transitions @xmath106 , described by their energy @xmath107 , coupling amplitude @xmath108 and damping @xmath109 : @xmath110 @xmath111 is the background constant .",
    "the values of the parameters are obtained by fitting experimental data . for clarity in the discussion about the plasmonic effects",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the lowest excitation for which @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "for the metallic layer we use silver with a permittivity described by a combination of drude and critical points models , as described in ref . , that cover the energy range @xmath115 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     the second part of the process is the radiative emission from the organic component , which can be negatively affected by the proximity with the metal layer .",
    "we consider each molecule as a single emitter .",
    "the radiative transfer in the open part of the device is depending on the emitter position due to interference effects ( see fig.[onemol ] ) with an initial excitation density that depends on the position and on the exciton diffusion in the sample .",
    "after integration we find a radiative decay for the frenkel exciton of about 40ns , which is in the range of the expected values for tetracene without considering any superradiance effect@xcite .",
    "the spacing between the organic and the metal is a key parameter as it has an opposite effect on the transfer from the well and the radiative emission . at @xmath116 ,",
    "the total efficiency is given fig.[qq ] and is less than one percent , 0.25% in the case of a strong diffusion .",

    "the plasmonic resonance leads also to a large quenching of the emission by the organic , which reduce significantly the final internal efficiency . a way to improve",
    "it further is to consider a patterned metal layer where most of the field will be directed in the dielectric , non absorbing holes in the metal , still taking advantage of the plasmonic enhancement .",
