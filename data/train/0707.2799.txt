    "each data set consisted of a sample angle rock through the bragg peak which was integrated in the vertical direction and plotted as a function of scattering angle , 2@xmath32 . a longitudinal cut through this two dimensional data set was performed , giving rise to the longitudinal scans shown in fig .",

    "the fact that we observe both twin domains in the mto phase means that the peak positions , the lattice parameters , and consequently the orthorhombic strain , 2(a - b)/(a+b ) , can be determined as a function of temperature .",
    "this is shown for all three samples in fig .",
    "the single ( 3 , 3 , 0)@xmath31 bragg peak breaks into ( 6 , 0 , 0)@xmath33 and ( 0 , 6 , 0)@xmath33 near t@xmath27=232 k , 272 k and 305 k in the x=0.125 , 0.095 , and 0.08 samples , respectively , before reforming into a single ( 3 , 3 , 0)@xmath34 bragg peak near t@xmath28=60 k , 45 k , and 35 k , respectively .",

    "note that for ease of comparison , the 2@xmath32 range of the scattering in figs .",
    "1 and 2 is the same .",
    "first , the orthorhomic strain decreases quite substantially with increasing ba concentration .",
    "the lowest temperature strain , for example , in the x=0.125 sample is roughly half that of the x=0.095 sample .",
    "secondly and more importantly , the longitudinal profile of the ( 3 , 3 , 0)@xmath34 peak at the lowest temperatures measured , well within the ltt phase , is considerably broader than the corresponding profile of ( 3 , 3 , 0)@xmath31 . this is true for both the x=0.125 sample and the x=0.095 sample as can be seen by comparing the top and bottom panels of fig .",
    "1b ( for x=0.125 ) and fig . 2b ( for x=0.095 ) .",
    "this shows that the ltt phase is either an admixture of a tetragonal and an orthorhombic phase , as was suggested by electron microscopy on an earlier generation of la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2  crystals@xcite , or that it is itself othorhombic with a very small orthorhombic strain . in either case",
    "it is not as  tetragonal \" as the htt phase , and is consistent with the  less orthorhombic \" low temperature structures proposed previously for la@xmath0sr@xmath7ba@xmath8cuo@xmath2 single crystals@xcite .",
    "longitudinal scans of the form shown in fig . 1b and",
    "2b were fit for the purpose of extracting the peak positions in 2@xmath32 and therefore the d spacings associated with the mto phase .",
    "this is straightforward for data far removed from the htt@xmath6mto phase transition , as the two peaks are well defined and separated , as can be seen in the middle panels of fig .",
    "1b and 2b .",
    "closer to the phase transition , one peak may appear as a shoulder to the other , and it is more difficult to ascribe unique values to the two lattice parameters .",
    "we fit these data in two different ways in order to attain robust values for the lattice parameters close to the transition .",
    "one of these was to simply fit the longitudinal scans to sums of lorentzians or lorentzians raised to an adjustable exponent , while a second technique was to look for zeros in the derivatives of the intensity as a function of 2@xmath32 .",
    "these gave consistent results for the lattice parameters , giving us confidence that the orthorhombic strain could be estimated accurately close to the transition .",
    "however , this technique also gives non - zero values for the orthorhombic strain , albeit relatively small ones , within the htt phase .",
    "previous work on the htt@xmath6mto phase transition in polycrystalline la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  and la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2  samples show the orthorhombic strain to scale as the square of the order parameter@xcite .",
    "consequently we examined the critical behaviour of the orthorhombic strain in our la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2  single crystals by fitting the measured strain as a function of temperature to : @xmath35 where the square of the order parameter , @xmath36 , is the orthorhombic strain , 2(a - b)/(a+b ) , and the background accounts for finite strain within the htt phase introduced by the fitting process described above .",
    "the results of this fitting is shown in fig .",

    "these measurements focus on the ( 3 , 3 , 0)@xmath31 bragg peak and show the htt@xmath6mto@xmath6ltt sequence of structural phase transitions known to be relevant to underdoped la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "the measurements also clearly show anomolous longitudinal broadening of the ( 3 , 3 , 0)@xmath34 bragg peaks in the x=0.095 and x=0.125 samples at low temperatures , indicating that the ltt phase is not a simple tetragonal phase , but rather an admixture of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases , or an orthorhombic phase with very small orthorhombic strain .",
    "critical orthorhombic strain measurements near the continuous htt@xmath6mto phase boundary show clear 3d universality , with universal behavior observed in the orthorhombic strain vs t / t@xmath27 for the three x=0.125 , 0.095 and 0.08 samples .",
    "the best estimate for a common critical exponent @xmath22 for these samples is @xmath22=0.34 @xmath37 0.04 , which is consistent with 3d xy universality expected theoertically for such ferroelastic transitions .",
