    "three decades ago , the dream of controlling chemical reactions with laser pulses has initiated the field of coherent control  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to selectively control the outcome of photo - induced reactions ",
    "formation of a chemical bond or creation of photofragments  by changing the parameters of the laser pulses .",
    "femtosecond pump - probe spectroscopy has been instrumental in bringing this dream closer to reality , terming the notion `` femtochemistry ''  @xcite .",
    "alkali halide diatomics were among the first molecules to be studied by femtosecond spectroscopy in the gas phase .",
    "their lowest electronic excitations mostly lie in the visible or ultraviolet spectral range and are therefore well accessible by femtosecond lasers .",
    "alkali halides are special in that their chemical bond has ionic character even in the electronic groundstate .",
    "this character results from the extremely differing electron affinities of the constituent atoms . as a consequence ,",
    "even the lowest excited states are subject to curve crossings with the ion - pair state potential curve at intermediate distances between the nuclei .",
    "these curve crossings give rise to non - adiabatic couplings and to predissociation of the photo - excited molecules .    in pioneering time - resolved experiments , zewail and",
    "coworkers have visualized the predissociation dynamics of sodium iodide ( nai ) and other alkali halides as the repeated passage of a coherent vibrational wave packet across the avoided curve crossing of the groundstate and the first excited state  @xcite . at every passage the wave packet splits up into one fraction which remains in a bound state and continues to vibrate , and another fraction which follows the dissociative branch of the potential , producing unbound na and i fragments  @xcite .",
    "such textbook quantum molecular dynamics can typically only be observed in gas phase experiments where the molecules are isolated from their environment . in the condensed phase ,",
    "the coherent motion induced by a femtosecond laser pulse is most often subject to very fast decay due to relaxation and dephasing processes . a noticable exception present diatomic alkali metal molecules attached to helium nanodroplets  @xcite .",
    "helium ( he ) droplets are quantum fluid clusters which feature extraordinary properties such as microscopic superfluidity  @xcite , a critical velocity for the undamped motion of embedded molecules  @xcite , and quantized states of angular momentum ( vortices )  @xcite . the dynamical response of he droplets can be probed by the wave packet motion of impurities such as alkali dimers .",
    "the vibrational dynamics of these molecules was found to be only weakly perturbed by the droplets . this can be explained by a weak coupling of alkali metal atoms and small molecules to helium droplets due to their position at the droplet surface .",
    "in contrast , recent studies of the impulsive alignment of molecules embedded in the droplet interior have evidenced that the rotational wave packet dynamics is significantly slowed down and rotational recurrences are completely suppressed  @xcite .    here , we present a femtosecond pump - probe photoionization study of free lii and of lii embedded in helium nanodroplets .",
    "lithium iodide , as all other molecules which do not purely consist of alkali or alkaline earth metals , are immersed in the interior of he droplets .",
    "therefore strong perturbations of vibrational dynamics by the he environment may be expected .",
    "we start by investigating the photodynamics of lii in the gas phase which is much less well characterized than that of nai .",
    "the latter has been studied in detail , both experimentally using femtosecond spectroscopy , and theoretically using semiclassical and quantum dynamical model calculations  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results on lii  @xcite suggest a similar predissociation dynamics as for nai . to clarify whether this expectation is indeed correct , we perform one - color femtosecond pump - probe measurements in the uv spectral range .",
    "we corroborate the experimental results with high - level _ ab initio _ calculations to determine the potential energy curves and non - adiabatic couplings from first principles .",
    "based on this data , we model the photoionization dynamics of lii , using both semiclassical arguments and full quantum dynamical simulations .    our paper is organized as follows .",

    "since the ionization energy of atomic li ( @xmath14ev ) exceeds the photon energy ( @xmath15ev ) , only the bound excited molecule lii@xmath16 can be ionized by one - photon absorption from a second probe pulse ( right vertical arrow ) .",
    "the fraction of the wave packet which follows the adiabatic potential curve converging toward the ionic curve at large @xmath17 can be ionized by photodetachment of the i@xmath5 component , leaving behind li@xmath1+i .",

    "the davidson correction is highly important for the final results since it largely compensates for the lack of size - extensivity of the mrci method .    for the triplet states of lii , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and for the lowest states of the lii@xmath1 ion , @xmath34 and @xmath35",

    "this is a well justified approximation , since we know that van der waals coefficients @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) depend on the asymptotic atomic states but not on the resultant molecular spin ; they thus are exactly the same for the low and high - spin states dissociating into the same atoms .",

    "[ fig : droplet ] ( b ) ) .",
    "however , no indications of a periodic modulation due to wave packet dynamics is observed .",
    "note that we can not exclude contributions to the electron signal from photoionization of contaminations in the he droplets , such as water picked up by the droplets from the residual gas .",
    "the lack of signal oscillations implies that the coherent vibrational wave packet motion is efficiently quenched by the interaction with the he environment .",
    "this contrasts previous experiments performed in our group where the droplets were doped with alkali metal dimers and trimers which reside in weakly bound dimple - like states at the surface of he droplets  @xcite . in those experiments , long - lived vibrational coherences were observed by detecting the neat dopant ions as a function of pump - probe delay .",
    "thus , molecules immersed in the droplet interior appear to be subjected to much stronger perturbation of the vibrational dynamics than those sitting at the droplet surface .",

    "the resulting deviation of @xmath105 with respect to the value obtained by accounting for only the @xmath2-@xmath0 avoided crossing amounts to about 5% .",

    "[ fig : ttauquantum ] where they are compared to the experimental values .",
    "the agreement between the simulations and the experiment is fairly good , confirming the accuracy of the _ ab initio _ potentials and couplings .",
    "the simulated values of @xmath88 shows the same dependence on the wavelength . the decay constant @xmath133 becomes minimal for @xmath134 nm as in the experiment .",
    "however , slight differences between simulation and experiment are present .",
    "in particular @xmath88 lies systematically below the measured values .",
    "this can be attributed to neglecting any initial vibrational excitation of lii in the quantum dynamics simulations .",
    "the results of simulations , where full thermal averaging over rotational states is performed , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttauquantum ] as well .",
    "thermal averaging does not significantly improve the agreement with the experiment which justifies the simplified approach using a single state , @xmath132 .",
    "we have studied the predissociation dynamics of lii in a one - color femtosecond pump - probe experiment for molecules in the gas phase and embedded in he nanodroplets .",
    "the wavelength was varied in the range @xmath135-@xmath136 nm .",
    "we have corroborated the experimental observations by full quantum dynamics simulations based on newly calculated _",
    "ab initio _ potential energy curves and non - adiabatic couplings .",
    "vibrational wave packet oscillations in the predissociative @xmath0-state are observed in both ion and electron yields for gas phase lii molecules .",
    "the exponential decay of the signal with increasing pump - probe delay times is interpreted in terms of predissociation due to diabatic coupling between the excited @xmath0-state and the ground @xmath2-state .",
    "the good agreement of the experimental and simulated pump - probe transients confirm the accuracy of the calculated potentials and coupling energies .",
    "predissociation is found to occur nearly exclusively via the @xmath2-@xmath0 avoided curve crossing .",
    "since it is a single crossing that determines the predissociation , the decay constant as a function of laser wavelength can also be reproduced by a semiclassical landau - zener model for the diabatic transition .",
    "the reason that the dynamics is dominated by the @xmath2-@xmath0 avoided crossing is due to the strong diabatic coupling between these states , found to amount to 650(20)@xmath10@xmath4 .",
    "this is much larger than the coupling between the @xmath0-state and the @xmath11-state of only 5(2)@xmath10@xmath4 .",
    "analogous measurements with lii embedded in he nanodroplets result in photoion signals that are strongly suppressed compared to the gas phase measurements .",
    "this is attributed to complex formation inside the droplets upon ionization . while the photoelectron signals have comparable amplitudes to those measured for free lii ,",
    "no wave packet oscillations are observed .",
    "this may be explained by a strong coupling of the excited lii to the he droplet which induces fast damping of the coherent vibrational wave packet motion .",
    "our observation is in contrast to femtosecond pump - probe experiments with diatomic alkali metal molecules attached to he nanodroplets for which the vibrational motion is well resolved  @xcite .",
    "the difference is rationalized by the different coupling of the molecules to the droplet environment .",
    "it results from different locations , on the droplet surface for the weakly coupled alkali dimers whereas molecules immersed in the droplet interior such as lii are subjected to strong coupling . for molecules inside the droplets , a similarly strong effect of the he environment on the molecular dynamics as observed here has also been reported for recent impulsive alignment experiments  @xcite .",
    "the droplets were found to alter the rotational period and suppress alignment revivals .",
    "these findings together call for a more comprehensive study of the ultrafast dynamics of molecules immersed in a he quantum fluid . for our pump - probe experiment , refined detection schemes such as ion imaging techniques would allow to unequivocally confirm suppression of coherent wave packet motion . more generally , it would also be interesting to see whether the regime of intermediate coupling between molecule and he droplet can be explored by using different molecular species , _ e.g. _ alkali - earth alkaline mixtures  @xcite",
    ". this would provide much needed input for the theoretical modeling of the interaction of molecules with he droplets and thus be crucial for developing a rigorous understanding of quantum fluid environments .",
