    "because of the desire to deal with heating problems in modern spintronic devices , there has been an increasing interest in investigating thermal effects in spintronics .",
    "a new subfield `` spin caloritronics ''  @xcite aims to understand the basic physics behind the interplay of spin and heat .",
    "one of the central issues in spin caloritronics is the newly discovered thermo - spin phenomenon termed spin seebeck effect  @xcite , which enables the thermal injection of spin currents from a ferromagnet into attached nonmagnetic metals over a macroscopic scale of several millimeters .",
    "the spin seebeck effect is now established as a universal aspect of ferromagnets because this phenomenon is observed in various materials ranging from the metallic ferromagnets ni@xmath0fe@xmath1  @xcite and co@xmath2mnsi  @xcite , to the semiconducting ferromagnet ( ga , mn)as  @xcite , to the insulating magnets lay@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4  @xcite .    it is important to note that the above experiments  @xcite were performed in a configuration of the _ transverse _ spin seebeck effect , in which the direction of the thermal spin injection into the attached nonmagnetic metal is _ perpendicular _ to the temperature gradient [ fig .",
    "[ fig1_icm2012adachi ] ( a ) ] .",
    "recently , another type of spin seebeck effect called the _ longitudinal _ spin seebeck effect  @xcite is reported , in which the direction of the thermal spin injection into the nonmagnetic metal is _ parallel _ to the temperature gradient [ fig .",
    "[ fig1_icm2012adachi ] ( b ) ] .",
    "whereas the longitudinal spin seebeck effect is well defined only for the use of an _ insulating _ ferromagnet due to the parasitic contribution from the anomalous nernst effect  @xcite , it has several attractive features : ( i ) it is substrate free , ( ii ) the configuration is much simpler than that of the transverse spin seebeck effect , and ( iii ) it can be of wide application because it allows the use of bulk samples .",
    "another pronounced feature of the longitudinal spin seebeck effect is that the sign of the spin injection signal is opposite to that in the transverse spin seebeck effect  @xcite .",
    "physically , the longitudinal spin seebeck effect is distinguished from the transverse spin seebeck effect by the fact that the attached nonmagnetic metal is in contact with the heat bath in the longitudinal setup , while the attached nonmagnetic metal is out of contact with the heat bath in the transverse setup .",
    "this brings about a clear difference that the heat current intensely flows into the attached nonmagnetic metal in the case of the longitudinal spin seebeck effect , whereas it does not in the case of the transverse spin seebeck effect .",
    "it is obvious that theory of magnon - driven spin seebeck effect  @xcite fails to explain the situation in question .        in this paper , by employing linear - response theory of the spin seebeck effect  @xcite and using the importance of the phonon - drag process in the spin seebeck effect  @xcite , we show that the sign of the spin injection signal in the longitudinal spin seebeck effect can be opposite to that in the conventional transverse spin seebeck effect when the electron - phonon interaction in the attached nonmagnetic metal is sufficiently large .",
    "the key in our discussion is the aforementioned difference in the position of the attached nonmagnetic metal between the longitudinal setup and the transverse setup .",
    "let us begin with the phenomenology of the longitudinal spin seebeck effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig1_icm2012adachi ] , a hybrid structure of a ferromagnet ( @xmath5 ) and a nonmagnetic metal ( @xmath6 ) is placed under a temperature gradient .",
    "the central quantity that characterizes the spin seebeck effect is the spin current @xmath7 injected into @xmath6 . as explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin seebeck effect is a thermal spin injection by localized spins , and the injected spin current has two contributions , @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( the so - called pumping component ) represents the spin current pumped into @xmath6 by the thermal fluctuations of localized spins in @xmath5 , while @xmath10 ( the so - called backflow component ) represents the spin current coming back into @xmath5 by the thermal fluctuations of the spin accumulations in @xmath6 .",
    "we now focus on the spin current injected into @xmath6 which is located close to the _ cold _ reservoir .    in the case of the conventional transverse spin seebeck effect ,",
    "the magnitude of the pumping component @xmath9 is greater than that of the backflow component @xmath9 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1_icm2012adachi](a ) ] . in contrast , the magnitude of @xmath9 is less than that of the backflow component @xmath9 in the case of the longitudinal spin seebeck effect [ fig .",
    "[ fig1_icm2012adachi](b ) ] . note that , because magnons carry minus spin 1 , both the pumping and backflow components have a negative sign .",
    "this difference can be explained phenomenologically on the basis of the following conditions : ( i ) most of the heat current in the @xmath5/@xmath6 hybrid system at room temperature is carried by phonons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of yttrium iron garnet ) , and ( ii ) the interaction between the phonons and the spin accumulation in @xmath6 is much stronger than the magnon - phonon interaction in @xmath5 .",
    "first , recall that the pumping and backflow components can be expressed as follows  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the effective temperature of the magnon in @xmath5 and the spin accumulation in @xmath6 . here , @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 being the @xmath18-@xmath19 interaction at the interface , the paramagnetic susceptibility in @xmath6 , and the spin - flip relaxation time in @xmath6 , respectively . the negative sign before @xmath20 arises from the fact that the magnon carries spin @xmath21 . in the longitudinal spin",
    "seebeck experiment , the nonmagnetic metal @xmath6 is in direct contact with the heat bath , and thereby is exposed to the flow of the phonon heat current due to condition ( i ) . then , because of condition ( ii ) , spin accumulation in @xmath6 is heated up faster than the magnons in the ferromagnet @xmath5 , and the resultant effective temperature of the spin accumulation in @xmath6 increases above that of the magnons in @xmath5 . in the conventional transverse spin seebeck setup , by contrast , the nonmagnetic metal @xmath6 is out of contact with the heat bath and the phonon heat current does not flow through the nonmagnetic metal @xmath6 , while the ferromagnet @xmath5 is in contact with the heat bath , resulting in an increase in the effective magnon temperature in @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in this case , the effective temperature of the spin accumulation in @xmath6 is lower than that of the magnons in @xmath5 .",
    "this difference can explain the sign reversal of the spin seebeck effect signal between the longitudinal setup and the conventional transverse setup .",
    "in this section we review the linear - response formalism of the spin seebeck effect developed in ref .  @xcite . in the next section , this formalism is employed to evaluate the longitudinal spin seebeck effect .",
