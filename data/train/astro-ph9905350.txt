    "the study of stellar populations is a way for astronomers to explore galaxy evolution , providing direct information on the variations of star - formation rate and mean abundance with time , from the present - day back to the initial formation of a galaxy .",
    "the ensemble of local group dwarf galaxies , because of their diversity of sizes , environments , and chemical abundances makes a good laboratory in which to investigate the processes which control galaxy evolution ( e.g. , hodge 1989 ; da costa 1998 ; grebel 1998 ; tolstoy 1999 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies are the most common class of galaxy in the universe , but there are a number of unresolved questions of dwarf galaxy evolution ; the relation between the early- ( elliptical / spheroidal ) and late- ( irregular ) type galaxies , the effects of environment on galaxy evolution , and the patterns of chemical enrichment are unanswered questions ( mateo 1998 ) . additionally , it may be that the ubiquitous faint , blue galaxies seen in redshift surveys ( e.g. ellis 1997 ) are the precursors of today s dwarf galaxies . the most straightforward way to trace this possible cosmological connection is by a determination of the star - formation histories of the nearby dwarf galaxies ( tolstoy 1998 ) .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams which include one or more main - sequence turnoffs are a powerful tool for the determination of detailed star - formation histories for galaxies .",
    "however , stellar crowding at the level of the horizontal branch and below has made this task all but impossible for ground - based telescopes .",
    "consequently , most studies to date have concentrated on the sparse , late - type dwarf galaxies , or the relatively uncrowded outer fields around dwarf irregulars .",
