    "the development of photonic devices using silicon as the optical medium is paving the way for a monolithically integrated optoelectronic platform in a single chip @xcite . owing to the large nonlinear refractive index of silicon ( 500 times larger than silica ) ,",
    "a number of functionalities based on nonlinear interactions have been demonstrated in recent years , such as raman lasers , frequency comb generators , parametric amplifiers , miniature oscilloscopes , wavelength converters , etc @xcite .",
    "however , silicon is affected by two - photon absorption ( tpa ) and free carrier absorption ( fca ) , two undesirable phenomena that limit the amount of power that can propagate in the silicon waveguide , so that tpa and fca consequently impair the performance of such a material for nonlinear devices @xcite .",
    "one way to solve this problem is to employ other materials and/or engineer the chromatic dispersion of the waveguide to substantially reduce the power threshold for nonlinear interactions .    in most nonlinear applications ( supercontinuum generation , parametric interactions , etc )",
    "the most suitable dispersion is low and anomalous over a broadband spectral range , however other applications like frequency comb generation require moderate anomalous dispersion in order to minimze noise buildup @xcite .",
    "furthermore , on chip nonlinear pulse compression can require strong normal dispersion over a broadband spectral range .",
    "indeed , chromatic dispersion can be modified by changing the core transversal dimensions of the waveguide @xcite . however",
    ", this procedure has proven to be insufficient if the aim is to control the dispersion profile in an arbitrary way .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that adding a thin extra layer of silicon nitride on top of the silicon core can modify the dispersion of the silicon waveguide .",
    "this approach has been explored further by using different refractive index arrangements in a multi - cladding configuration @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of dispersion engineering using more than one cladding layer was recently achieved by adding a 60-nm thick hafnium dioxide layer on top of a silicon nitride core , the outcome being that the dispersion became more anomalous @xcite .",
    "although there have been considerable advancements in the field of silicon photonics over the last years @xcite , a systematic investigation of how to engineer chromatic dispersion is still not very advanced in comparison to , for example , the engineering of the dispersion achieved in photonic crystal fibers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the high index contrast , silicon waveguides have a strong dispersion ( larger than hundreds of ps / nm / km ) so that their engineering is strongly sensitive to refractive index and dimension inaccuracies during the fabrication process",
    ". silicon nitride constitutes a promising alternative material to silicon due to the absence of tpa and fca at all usable infrared wavelengths @xcite and its compatibility with the cost - effective cmos technology . due to the smaller refractive index contrast with silica",
    ", @xmath0 appears to be a more appropriate material for dispersion engineering than silicon , since typical fabrication inaccuracies will have lower impact on dispersion , as we demonstrate in the following .",
    "the aim of this investigation is producing flat dispersion profiles over broad spectral ranges with arbitrary average dispersion ( changing continuously from normal to anomalous dispersion ) and with waveguide parameters that are realistic from a fabrication point of view .",
    "figure 1 shows the schematics of the cross - section of the waveguides under investigation . there is a substrate layer of silicon ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) with a silica buffer layer of two micron thickness on top of it .",
    "these are topped with a silicon nitride core ( with width @xmath2 and height @xmath3 ) and a silica upper cladding .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the conventional single - cladding silicon nitride waveguide without any extra cladding layers . in order to engineer the dispersion , part of the upper cladding",
    "is modified by including two thin ( up to 400 nm ) cladding layers , made of silica and/or @xmath0 .",
    "the thicknesses of these extra layers are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and their refractive indices are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the lateral wall thickness is @xmath8 in all the cases .",
    "two different refractive index arrangements involving the two extra cladding layers are investigated . in the first case , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , a high refractive index contrast is considered : for this purpose , the first cladding layer is made of silica and covers only the top of the core , while the second layer is made of @xmath0 . in the second case , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , a small refractive index contrast is arranged : the two cladding layers are either @xmath9 or @xmath0 , however there is a refractive index difference of up to 3% between each layer ( see fig . 1c ) .",
    "for these two different refractive index arrangements , four parameters are changed to optimize the dispersion profile : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , we analyze whether the inclusion of a rib - like waveguide structure , as schematically shown in figs .",
    "f ) , has further effects on the dispersion profile .",
    "we finally investigate the effect of the core side - wall angle , which we varied between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .        for the modeling , we employed full vectorial beam prop and femsim packages from commercially available rsoft software . in the first step , we checked the consistency of the calculated dispersion profiles when using both packages , obtaining very good agreement between them @xcite",
    "then , we checked the accuracy of the simulation tool by comparing it with well - known full vectorial analytical solutions of chromatic dispersion in cylindrical optical fibers with a @xmath0 core .",
    "since the numerical accuracy of the algorithm depends on the propagation length and the grid resolution , the simulation was repeated while one of those parameters was increased .",
    "convergence is reached when the effective refractive index stabilizes into a particular value .",
    "the effective refractive index is calculated for the quasi - te and quasi - tm modes of the designed @xmath0 waveguides .",
    "the chromatic dispersion , @xmath12 , is related to the effective refractive index by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wavelength , @xmath15 is the speed of light , and @xmath16 is the effective refractive index .",
    "the contribution of material dispersion to the total dispersion is calculated by using the @xmath0 refractive index in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "an interesting characteristic of silicon nitride is that its refractive index value can be varied over a fairly large range ( 1.7 - 2.2 ) by changing the deposition process . to estimate the impact that refractive index variability has on material dispersion ,",
    "we compared four different values for the silicon nitride refractive index , as shown in fig .",
    "the data depicted with a black line was retrieved from reference @xcite and will be called index a , the red line ( index b ) comes from the sellmeier equation reported in @xcite , the green line ( index c ) was measured using inline ellipsometry in our fabricated plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) @xmath0 films , and finally the blue line ( index d ) comes from @xcite .",
    "figure 2(right ) shows the calculated material dispersion for the @xmath0 refractive indices a , b , c , and d. at short wavelengths , the material dispersion is strongly dependent on the @xmath0 refractive index characteristics ( at 1400 nm , for example , the material dispersion is -75 ps / nm / km for index a and -135 ps / nm / km for index c ) .",
    "this finding indicates that , unlike in the case of silica or silicon , the dispersion can also be engineered by adjusting the deposition process . due to this variability",
    ", the exact refractive index needs to be known in advance with considerable accuracy in order to obtain any specific dispersion profile . in what follows of this paper ,",
    "unless indicated otherwise , all calculations are performed using the refractive index c and for the fundamental mode .",
    "the goal of our calculations is finding the flattest profiles over the largest bandwidth , where the flatness is defined as the smallest variation of the dispersion over a given bandwidth .",
    "we first review the well known case when no extra cladding layers are added ( @xmath17 for @xmath18 ) and the dispersion is modified solely by changing the width and the height of the @xmath0 core @xcite . since fabricating large @xmath3 values can result in an increase of stress , we only consider the case when @xmath2 is larger than @xmath3.the chromatic dispersions calculated for a waveguide with width @xmath19 @xmath20 m and heights @xmath21 ( black ) , @xmath22 ( red ) , and @xmath23 @xmath20 m ( green ) are shown in fig .",

    "the calculations were done for the quasi - te ( solid lines ) and quasi - tm ( dotted lines ) modes . while the material dispersion is always normal in the near infrared as shown in fig .",
    "2(right ) , the strong geometrical dispersion due to the confinement of the light in a waveguide results in a total dispersion that can be anomalous over quite large spectral bandwidths @xcite .",
    "the dispersion profiles for quasi - te modes are flatter and tend to shift to longer wavelengths in comparison to the quasi - tm mode profiles . by increasing the core width ,",
    "the dispersion is vertically down shifted and becomes flatter - an effect that is much stronger for the quasi - te mode .",
    "furthermore , a small increase of the core height produces a fairly large vertical up - shift of the dispersion profile , while its shape remains unchanged . from the results in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , a basic rule for dispersion engineering can be deduced : a dispersion profile with a given flatness can be vertically shifted by changing @xmath3 .",

    ", we changed @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 in steps of 10 nm while @xmath3 is changed in steps of 25 nm . as illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , the optimization of the four parameters produces very flat profiles across the 1.65 - 2.5 @xmath20 m spectral region with average dispersion that can be tuned from -85 to + 17 ps / nm / km .",
    "the third order dispersion is calculated to be @xmath36 = 0.0005 ps / nm@xmath37/km at 2 microns for most of the dispersion cases .",
    "the dispersion flatness in fig .",

    "the one with average dispersion of -85 ps / nm / km is called profile @xmath38 while the one with + 17 ps / nm / km is named profile @xmath39 .",
    "the remarkable fact from table 1 is that for a given @xmath3 , a flattened profile can always be engineered by optimizing the @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 values .",
    "the optimized values of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are universally valid in the sense that an increase of the value of @xmath3 invariably produces a vertical up - shift of the dispersion , which nonetheless leaves the flatness of the dispersion profile nearly unchanged .",

    "we first checked how dispersion is modified by changing the thickness of the silica cladding layer from @xmath46 to @xmath42 @xmath20 m , as shown in fig .",
    "the dispersion profile in green is the same as the one depicted in yellow ( profile i ) in fig .",
    "6 . as @xmath4",
    "is increased , the dispersion is tilted up for shorter wavelengths , and down for longer wavelengths , while all dispersion profiles intersect at a narrow wavelength region ( around @xmath47 @xmath20 m ) @xcite .",
    "we numerically verified that this intersection point can be tuned over a broad spectral range by changing @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 . on the other hand , by increasing @xmath5 the dispersion is vertically down - shifted ( the black line corresponds to @xmath48 @xmath20 m , while the magenta one refers to @xmath49 @xmath20 m ) .",
    "since the down - shift of the profile is less pronounced at longer wavelengths , the dispersion flatness can be controlled via a tuning of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "results in fig . 8",
    "show that a proper adjustement of @xmath4 and @xmath5 produces a flattened dispersion at spectral regions that can be tailored .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath0 as the core material instead of silicon is mainly due to its robustness against dimension fluctuations .",
    "silicon slot waveguides were shown to require fabrication accuracies of the order of 1 nm in order to have a controllable dispersion tuning @xcite .",
    "the flat dispersion profiles found in the previous section were obtained using silica and silicon nitride as first and second cladding layers , giving a ratio of their refractive indices of @xmath50 . an important question in this context",

    "therefore , a low - contrast ( @xmath51 ) cladding - refractive - index arrangement is investigated : for the first cladding layer @xmath52 while for the second cladding layer @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the silicon nitride refractive index of the core .",
    "the thicknesses @xmath4 and @xmath5 are varied from @xmath55 to @xmath56 @xmath20 m , and the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 are scanned to retrieve flat dispersion profiles .",
    "fairly flat profiles were found only for a reduced range of parameters .",
    "figure 9 shows in solid lines those dispersion profiles plotted for @xmath57 @xmath20 m and @xmath58 @xmath20 m , while @xmath3 is varied from @xmath59 to @xmath60 @xmath20 m .",
    "the dispersion is fairly flat from @xmath61 to @xmath62 @xmath63 m , although not to the same extent as it is in the higher index contrast case and is not over such a broad bandwidth . in order to understand the real impact of this refractive index gradient on dispersion ,",
    "we perform the calculation for the same values of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 while the refractive index contrast is reduced to zero ( i.e. like a single - cladding waveguide with larger @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the simulation results are shown in dotted lines for comparison : the two extra cladding layers with refractive indices that are 1.5 and 3 % lower than the core produce a small vertical down - shift of the dispersion profile with only a negligible change of its shape . by performing simulations where the @xmath2 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 parameters are changed",
    ", it is found that the retrieved dispersion is always a vertically down - shifted version of the case when the refractive index contrast is set to zero : multi - cladding waveguides with small refractive index contrast have equivalent dispersion profiles than single - cladding waveguides .",
    "this is explained as due to the small contribution from geometrical dispersion when the index contrast is small .    the effective mode area as a function of wavelength is plotted in fig .",
    "10 , for both cases ( with and without refractive index gradient ) .",
    "the field spatial distribution is very similar for both index arrangements , with a noticeable difference in the mode - area only at short wavelengths .",

    "dashed lines show the case when all layers have the same refractive index . ]        for completeness , other arrangements involving small refractive index contrasts were analyzed .",
    "for example , by choosing @xmath65 and @xmath66 or @xmath67 and @xmath66 , no appreciable improvement is obtained in terms of dispersion control if compared with the single - cladding waveguide @xcite . the results in this section",
    "show that moderate to large refractive index contrasts between the different layers of the waveguide are required in order to enhance the strength of the geometrical dispersion and produce arbitrary dispersion profiles .",
    "the waveguide geometry can be modified not only by changing @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but also by including a rib - like structure as in figures 1(d , e , f ) .",
    "the chromatic dispersion is calculated for a waveguide with a rib - like structure like fig .",

    "9 shows that the inclusion of a rib - like structure produces a vertical down - shift of the dispersion as well as a change of its flattness .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 can be used in conjunction with @xmath3 to vertically shift a dispersion profile that has already been engineered .",
    "furthermore , this kind of profile can be used to reduce the impact of dimension fluctuations . on the other hand",

    "due to unavoidable uncertainties during the fabrication process of the @xmath0 waveguides , the refractive index and the transversal dimensions might not correspond to what was originally conceived . consequently",
    ", if the fabrication inaccuracies are too large , the designed ultra - flat dispersion profile might not be as flat as initially intended . to assess the impact that refractive index and transversal dimension random fluctuations have on dispersion , several pecvd @xmath0 and @xmath34 films",

    "both the refractive index and the thickness are measured using in - line ellipsometry at locations evenly scattered over a 200 mm diameter wafer .",
    "figure 13 shows the @xmath0 refractive index for 25 wafer locations as well as their corresponding calculated material dispersions . the refractive index fluctuation ( around 2% )",
    "will provoke a fluctuation ( and therefore an uncertainty ) of the dispersion of @xmath73 ps / nm / km at 1550 nm and @xmath74 ps / nm / km at 2500 nm .",
    "however , since most of our films exhibited a refractive index fluctuations of 1% over the entire wafer , this fluctuation shall produce a @xmath75 ps / nm / km uncertainty at 1550 nm .",
    "dimensions inaccuracy during fabrication is another ( important ) source of dispersion uncertainty . while the targeted thickness of the @xmath0 film was 750 nm , the measured values over the 200 mm wafer scatter from 752 to 776 nm as shown in fig .",
    "however , it is always possible to select a region of the wafer where the thickness corresponds to what was originally intended",
    ". nevertheless , the average offset of 14 nm is an example of a fairly large uncertainty : grown pecvd @xmath0 films with accuracy of 2 - 3 nm are also very common .",
    "these values indicate that the dispersion uncertainty caused by the thickness inaccuracies are of the order of a few ps / nm / km .",

    "this up - shift in turn results in a change of the zero dispersion location .",
    "figure 19 shows the measured chromatic dispersion for the quasi - te mode in waveguides where , through an increase either of the core height or of the cladding layer thickness , the location of the @xmath99s is progressively shifted .",
    "the blue line shows the measured dispersion in a single - cladding waveguide with @xmath70 @xmath20 m and @xmath95 @xmath20 m - there are two @xmath99s located at @xmath100 @xmath101 1150 and @xmath102 @xmath101 1720 nm .",
    "the dispersion of a small refractive index contrast waveguide with @xmath70 @xmath20 m , @xmath21 @xmath20 m , and @xmath68 @xmath20 m is plotted with a black line . because of adding the layers @xmath83 and @xmath103 , the dispersion profile is vertically up - shifted : the @xmath102 is shifted to 1980 nm , while the @xmath100 lies outside of our measurement spectral range but , by extrapolation , is expected to be at @xmath1041120 nm . the red line shows the dispersion of a small refractive index contrast waveguide with @xmath69 @xmath20 m , @xmath21 @xmath20 m , and @xmath105 @xmath63 m where the profile is again vertically up - shifted : the @xmath102 is at @xmath1042150 nm . finally , for a waveguide with @xmath69 @xmath20 m , @xmath21 @xmath20 m , and @xmath57 @xmath20 m the profile in green shows that there is only one zero dispersion wavelength ( @xmath100 @xmath101 1480 nm ) at the spectral region of our measurements .",
    "the waveguide parameters for the cases illustrated in black and green lines are identical with the ones in dotted red and solid black lines in the simulation of figure 11 , respectively .",
    "the qualitative agreement between both results is excellent : for example , @xmath106 1480 nm in the green spectrum in fig .",
    "19 and 1550 nm in the corresponding simulation in fig . 11 ( black solid line ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath99s @xmath104 are located at 1120 and at 1980 nm in the black spectrum in fig .",
    "19 and at 1280 and at 2060 nm in the corresponding simulation in fig .",
    "11 ( red dashed line ) . even though the shape agrees well ( but measured profiles are slightly blue - shifted in comparison with simulation ) , quantitatively , the measured dispersion is higher ( 80 vs. 45 ps / nm / km ) than the simulated one .",
    "we believe that this is primarily due to the refractive index uncertainty and also to the uncertainty of the exact waveguide dimensions ( estimated to have an error of 5 - 10 nm ) .      as demonstrated in the simulation sections , a large refractive index contrast is required to have a more arbitrary control of the chromatic dispersion , in particular flat profiles centered at the telecommunication window .",
    "figure 20 shows the measured chromatic dispersion of the quasi - te mode of multi - cladding waveguides with a refractive index arrangement similar to fig .",
    "the inset shows the sketch of the transversal section of the fabricated waveguides . the profile in blue",
    "is obtained with waveguide dimensions @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath19 @xmath20 m , @xmath107 nm and @xmath108 nm : even though the dispersion profile has comparable flatness ( @xmath1 11 ps / nm / km variation between 1300 and 1800 nm ) as in the multi - cladding waveguide with small refractive index contrast , the advantage of having large contrast is that the average dispersion is lower and the mode confinement is tighter .",
    "the profile in black ( @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath19 @xmath20 m , @xmath109 nm and @xmath108 nm ) has a larger @xmath4 , so that similar flatness to the one in blue is produced while the average dispersion is lower .",
    "finally , a strong increase of @xmath5 and a decrease of @xmath4 ( @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath19 @xmath20 m , @xmath110 nm and @xmath111 nm ) results in a much better dispersion optimization - the profile in green is very flat ( 31 @xmath1 3.2 ps / nm / km ) in the region between 1300 and 1800 nm .",
    "this flatness is comparable to the ones in state - of - the - art photonic crystal fibers @xcite .",
    "figure 21 illustrates that even though the dimensions of the fabricated @xmath0 waveguides were chosen to produce flat dispersion profiles for the quasi - te propagation mode , the multi - cladding arrangement is also advantageous to flatten dispersion for quasi - tm propagation .",
    "this is well exemplified with the profile depicted in red which is obtained with the waveguide dimensions @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath69 @xmath20 m , @xmath110 nm and @xmath111 nm and has a dispersion variation of @xmath1 2 ps / nm / km between 1210 and 1400 nm .",
    "the precision of the whole engineering process ( fabrication and dispersion characterization ) is illustrated by changing by a small amount the waveguide dimensions .",
    "the profile in black is obtained with identical dimensions than the one in red except that @xmath70 @xmath20 m : it has similar flatness and shape in comparison with the profile in red , as expected from simulations .",
    "furthermore , from simulations it is expected that a decrease of @xmath5 produces a vertical up - shift of the dispersion profile . in this context , a waveguide having dimensions @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath70 @xmath20 m , @xmath107 nm and @xmath108 nm produces the profile in blue which is vertically up - shifted by 40 ps / nm / km from the previous cases . finally , the profile in green is with a waveguide with identical dimensions than the one in blue except that @xmath69 @xmath20 m : both profiles have very similar shapes as expected from simulations .",
    "multi - cladding waveguides with dispersion engineered characteristics should reduce the power threshold for nonlinear interactions . to verify this",
    "we propagate a train of 85 fs pulses with a central wavelength at 1560 nm with the aim of generating supercontinuum ( sc ) .",
    "pulses with 90 pj energy are coupled into the quasi - te mode of the 1.4 cm long @xmath0 waveguide with a dispersion flattened profile : @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath19 @xmath20 m , @xmath110 nm and @xmath111 nm ( its dispersion is depicted with a green line in figure 20 ) .",
    "two osas ( one operating from 350 to 1200 nm while the other from 1200 to 2400 nm ) are used to acquire the sc spectra .",
    "the generated sc is fairly flat and extends nearly over three octaves ( from 700 to 2400 nm , limited by the operating bandwidth of the osa ) . at 800",
    "nm a strong dispersive wave is generated .",
    "this is the broadest sc generated in an integrated waveguide @xcite .",
    "the dependency of the bandwidth with the dispersion profile is illustrated in the light - blue spectrum which was obtained for the quasi - tm mode of a 1.4 cm long waveguide with @xmath112 @xmath20 m , @xmath70 @xmath20 m , and @xmath113 ( its dispersion is depicted in figure 25 ) @xcite . due to the much larger and less flat dispersion",
    ", the sc spans only between 1250 and 2300 nm . to verify that the different sc bandwidths come from the different dispersion characteristics ,",
    "the propagation losses are measured by substracting the transmission power in waveguides with different lengths .",
    "the losses ( peaking at 1520 due to h - n bonds ) are similar for both types of multi - cladding waveguides as can be seen in the green line for the waveguide with flat and low dispersion and the light green line for the one with large dispersion .",
    "dispersion engineering by geometrical and refractive index optimization in silicon nitride waveguides was numerically and experimentally investigated .",
    "we demonstrated that by incorporating cladding layers with a refractive index ratio of @xmath114 , very flat dispersion profiles can be engineered .",
    "for this refractive index ratio , random fluctuations of the waveguide parameters preclude producing ultra - flat dispersion profiles , although profiles with @xmath1 0.5 ps / nm / km variation are still numerically demonstrated over a 740 nm bandwidth .",
    "single- and multi - cladding waveguides were fabricated and their dispersion profiles measured , showing that flattened profiles are accessible for both quasi - te and quasi - tm mode propagation .",
    "the profiles can be modified with high predictability by changing the core height or the thickness of the cladding layers .",
    "a flat dispersion profile with a variation of @xmath1 3.2 ps / nm / km variation over a 500 nm bandwidth is obtained in a multi - cladding waveguide fabricated with a refractive index contrast of 1.37 .",
    "the dispersion control characteristics demonstrated here are particularly useful for improving the performance of a number of nonlinear devices and a specific case is analyzed by demonstrating almost three octaves sc generation .",
    "this should open new avenues for the advancement of linear and nonlinear functionalities on a chip .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the financial support from the federal ministry of education and research ( bmbf ) under grants 03z2an11 and 03z2an12 .",
    "beate kerpen is gratefully acknowledged for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "to determine the chromatic dispersion , we divide the interference pattern in sub - sections containing an appropriate number of maxima ( around 2 - 4 ) and perform a sinusoidal fit with the following function :      it is assumed that in each sub - section @xmath96 is well represented by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , @xmath118 is the frequency and @xmath119 is a phase for that subsection .",
    "the coefficient @xmath120 is the amplitude of the sinusoidal function , while @xmath38 is an offset to fit the spectrum .",
    "the advantage of this fitting function is that it involves the whole interference spectrum , and not only the region where the maxima are located @xcite .",
    "the black dots in figures 23(a ) , 24(a ) , and 25(a ) show examples of retrieved @xmath98 values over a bandwidth of @xmath121 thz .",
    "the data is then fitted with a third - order polynomial shown with a red line . by taking the derivative of this polynomial the chromatic dispersion ( shown in solid black lines in figures 23(b ) , 24(b ) , and 25(b ) )",
    "is finally retrieved .",
    "the case in figure 23 corresponds to a waveguide with small refractive - index contrast ( as in fig .",
    "1c ) and having @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath57 @xmath20 m .",
    "figure 24 illustrates the very flat dispersion profile case shown in figure 20 ( @xmath21 @xmath20 m , @xmath19 @xmath20 m , @xmath107 nm , and @xmath122 @xmath20 m ) .",
    "finally , the figure 25 shows the profile for the quasi tm mode of a single cladding waveguide with @xmath112 @xmath20 m and @xmath70 @xmath20 m ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "note that in all the cases , the measured @xmath98 shows a dip centered at around 200 thz ( 1520 nm ) which comes from transmission losses due to h - n bonds ( see transmission spectrum in fig .",
    "while in the flattened case , @xmath98 changes merely from 4 to 6.5 ps@xmath123 ( indicating that the dispersion is low and constant ) , in the other two cases the change is much bigger ( from -6 to -12.5 ps@xmath123 and from from -6.5 to -19.5 ps@xmath123 ) accounting for a larger chromatic dispersion .",
    "figure 24(a ) shows a region between 210 and 220 thz where the measured data can not be fitted by the third order polynomial - this might be due to the extreme flatness in this waveguide .",
    "furthermore , figures 23(a ) , 24(a ) , and 25(a ) indicate that the measurements are expected to be more accurate in determining the zero dispersion wavelength ( that occurs when the derivative of @xmath98 is zero ) than in determining the maximum of dispersion ( that occurs when the second derivative of @xmath98 is zero ) .          when making the polynomial fitting of @xmath98 , we calculated the curves where there is 95% probability that the measured @xmath98 values will lie within this confidence interval . from these curves , we calculated the red curves in figures 23(b ) , 24(b ) , and 25(b ) - the resulting dispersion within the 95% confidence interval is nearly indistinguishable from the original curves ( except at the edges ) for the large dispersion cases and there is a small difference for the flat and low dispersion case . for comparison purposes , the dotted black lines in figs .",
    "23(b ) , 24(b ) , and 25(b ) show the measured dispersion before doing the substraction of the group delay obtained when the waveguide is removed .",
    "the difference between solid and dotted lines illustrates the contribution of the group delay from uncompensated optical components in the interferometer , which is important only at long wavelengths .",
    "a comparison of the chromatic dispersion when it was measured over large bandwidths ( @xmath124 nm ) and over much shorter ones ( e.g. 300 nm ) shows that covering both @xmath125s is the optimal condition for a more accurate dispersion measurement .",
