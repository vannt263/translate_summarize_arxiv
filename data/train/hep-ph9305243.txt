    "supersymmetric models have well constrained higgs sectors @xcite which can provide crucial tests of them . in particular , the mssm contains two higgs doublets @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with hypercharges @xmath13 , coupled to quarks and leptons in the superpotential f_m = h_t qh_2 u^c + h_b qh_1 d^c+ h _",
    "lh_1 e^c , and a physical higgs sector containing two scalar ( @xmath14 ) , one pseudoscalar ( @xmath15 ) and two charged ( @xmath16 ) states . its most constraining feature is the existence of an absolute upper bound on the tree - level mass of the @xmath1 lightest higgs boson @xmath17 given by ( with @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , m_hm_z2  .",
    "the bound ( [ mhmssm ] ) would suggest that the light higgs of the mssm should be discovered at lep-200 @xcite .",
    "so , what would happen if the higgs is _ not _ discovered with a mass below @xmath2 ?",
    "there is still a hope for supersymmetry since the bound ( [ mhmssm ] ) is spoiled by * radiative corrections * and by the presence of an * enlarged higgs sector*. the question to be answered in this talk is , how large are those effects ?",
    "radiative corrections in the mssm have been computed using different methods , with results which are in very good agreement to each other : _ i ) _ standard diagrammatic techniques @xcite ; _ ii ) _ one - loop effective potential @xcite ; and , _ iii ) _ renormalization group approach ( rga ) @xcite .",
    "the latter ( rga ) method is _ reliable _ for a scale of supersymmetry breaking @xmath20 .",
    "the technical reason being that in the limit @xmath21 the higgs @xmath22 becomes the standard model higgs , with a mass @xmath23 , while the other states decouple , since @xmath24 .",
    "the rga method is also _",
    "universal _ in the sense that it is valid ( can pick the leading radiative contribution from the top - stop sector ) for general supersymmetric standard models .",
    "we have shown in fig .  1 the upper bound on @xmath0 in the mssm for different values of @xmath25 , from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , using the rga method of ref .",
    "@xcite , which includes two - loop corrections . from fig .  1",
    "one can conclude that for @xmath28 and @xmath4 , @xmath29 .",
    "the case of the mssm with a gauge singlet field @xmath30 coupled to the rest of the higgs sector through the cubic superpotential f_h = s  h_1h_2+s^3 was first studied in @xcite where the tree level bound m_h^2(^2",
    "2+^2 2)m_z^2 , was found .",
    "notice that ( [ mhsing ] ) does not depend either on the supersymmetric masses or on the supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "it depends on @xmath31 , whose maximum value ( @xmath32 ) is obtained assuming the theory remains perturbative below the high scale @xmath33 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we have included @xmath34 and @xmath35 in ( [ fm ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath36 . for a fixed value of @xmath37 ( _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath35 ) , @xmath31 and @xmath34 are related to each other through the renormalization group equations ( rge ) , as shown in fig .",
    "radiative corrections are introduced using different methods ( the rga @xcite , and the one - loop effective potential @xcite ) with results consistent within less than 5% for all the considered @xmath38-range .",
    "the final upper bound on @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "2b from where one can see that the absolute upper bound is @xmath39 , though its precise value depends on @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "the previous analysis has been generalized in refs.@xcite to supersymmetric standard models with arbitrary higgs sectors .",
    "we have introduced , on top of the higgs doublets @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which take vacuum expectation values and are coupled to the quarks and leptons through ( [ fm ] ) : _ i ) _ an arbitrary number of extra pairs @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , decoupled from quarks and leptons in order to avoid dangerous flavor changing neutral currents ; _ ii ) _ gauge singlets @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; _ iii ) _ @xmath45 triplets @xmath46 , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ; _ iv ) _ @xmath45 triplets @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "other higgs representations will only contribute to the gauge @xmath53-functions and will not provide renormalizable couplings to @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "they will result in lower values of the upper bounds and need not be considered .",
    "assuming the most general renormalizable superpotential generalizing ( [ fh ] ) f_h=_1 h_1 h_2 + _ 2 h_1 h_2 + _ 1 _ 1 h_1 + _ 2 _ 2 h_2 + one can obtain the tree - level bound m_h^2/v^2(g^2+g^2)^2 2 + ( ^2_1 + ^2_2)^2 2 + ^2_1 ^ 4 + ^2_2 ^ 4 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the @xmath59 gauge couplings . in particular , the bound ( [ mhsing ] ) is recovered when @xmath60 , and the bound ( [ mhmssm ] ) in the mssm when also @xmath61 .",
    "the bound ( [ mhgen ] ) is independent of the soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters , or any supersymmetric mass terms .",
    "it is only controlled by @xmath62 and dimensionless parameters ( @xmath63 , and yukawa couplings ) .",
    "since the former is fixed by the electroweak scale , the latter will determine the bound ( [ mhgen ] ) .",
    "the upper bound then comes from the requirement that the supersymmetric theory remains perturbative below @xmath7 .",
    "in particular the bound is maximized when some of the involved couplings ( generically @xmath31 ) _ saturate _ the high - scale @xmath7 , _ i.e. _ when @xmath64 . to guarantee this condition",
    "we need to solve the rge of all gauge and yukawa couplings of the theory .    given a model @xmath65 ,",
    "the gauge couplings saturate a particular scale @xmath66 .",
    "conversely , given a scale @xmath7 there is a set of models whose gauge couplings saturate @xmath7 . out of them",
    "we pick the model which provides the maximum value of the upper bound .",
    "there is in this way a one - to - one correspondence between models and scales , and we can obtain the upper bound @xmath67 for all models which are perturbative below the given scale @xmath7 .",
    "for instance the scale @xmath8 is saturated by the model @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for simplicity",
    ", we have analyzed the case @xmath70 , where @xmath71 by tuning vacuum expectation values .",
    "radiative corrections are introduced using the rga @xcite with @xmath72 .",
    "the upper bound corresponding to @xmath8 is shown in fig .  3a .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "3a that the absolute upper bound is @xmath9 for all values of @xmath38 and @xmath37 , though there is a strong dependence on those parameters .",
    "the upper bound @xmath67 as a function of @xmath38 , and any value of @xmath37 , is shown in fig .",
    "3b for different values of the scale @xmath7 .",
    "we have obtained the most general upper bound for the mass of the lightest higgs boson in supersymmetric standard models which remain perturbative below a scale @xmath7 .",
    "radiative corrections are taken into account using the renormalization group approach . for a given scale",
    "the obtained bounds are stronger than those in the standard model and satisfy @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "our results are not taking into account ( and could be affected by ) : _ i ) _ the presence of _ extra colored fermions _ ( @xmath75 ) that could introduce new radiative corrections @xcite ; _ ii ) _ the presence of an _ extra gauge group factor _ ( @xmath76 ) that would result in @xmath77 .",
