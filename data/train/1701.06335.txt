    "the boson @xmath0 discovered @xcite in 2012 by the cms and atlas collaborations was reported to have a mass about 125 gev and some decay modes predicted for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "since that time , the observed particle , called the higgs boson , has been intensively studied ( see , for example , papers  @xcite ) .",
    "a main goal of experiments on the higgs boson physics has been to prove or disprove the hypothesis that @xmath0 is the sm higgs boson .",
    "apart from the decay channels , the sm predicts that @xmath0 has @xmath13 .",
    "the followed thorough analysis has fine - tuned the mass of @xmath0 , which is @xmath14 gev according to ref .",
    "@xcite , and has yielded some information on its spin and its @xmath2 parity .    in particular , the observation of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) means that the higgs boson spin is 0 , 1 , or 2 while the fact that @xmath0 decays @xcite to @xmath17 and the landau - yang theorem exclude the spin - one variant .",
    "further , the analyses presented in @xcite rule out many spin - two hypotheses at a 99% confidence level ( cl ) or higher . therefore , we conclude that the spin of the higgs boson is 0 with a probability of about 99% .    to clarify the @xmath2 properties of @xmath0 , in ref .",
    "we study the decay of a spin - zero particle @xmath1 into two off - mass - shell @xmath3 bosons @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath1 is defined as an elementary neutral particle with zero spin , our study applies to the higgs boson .",
    "moreover , it can apply to the dilaton if this boson actually exists .",
    "the amplitude of the decay @xmath18 depends ( see eq .",

    "these functions determine the @xmath2 properties of the boson @xmath1 and are called the @xmath19 couplings . using the cms and atlas experimental data on the decay @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 stands for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 ) , these collaborations in refs .",
    "@xcite and we in ref .",
    "have obtained some constraints on the @xmath20 couplings .",
    "these constraints demonstrate that @xmath0 is not a @xmath2-odd state and it may be the sm higgs boson , another @xmath2-even state , or a boson with indefinite @xmath2 parity .",
    "besides , as shown in , a non - zero imaginary part of the @xmath20 couplings is not excluded , which can be related to small loop corrections and possibly to a non - hermiticity of the @xmath20 interaction .    thus , the @xmath2 parity of the higgs boson is not yet fully ascertained .",
    "moreover , in some supersymmetric extensions of the sm there are @xcite neutral bosons with negative or indefinite @xmath2 parity .",
    "that is why it is now important to establish the @xmath2 properties of the higgs boson .",

    "<S> integration of these formulas yields some standard model histogram distributions of the decay @xmath8 which are compared with corresponding monte carlo simulated distributions obtained by atlas and with atlas experimental data . </S>"
