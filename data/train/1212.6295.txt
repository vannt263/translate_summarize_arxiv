    "in the past thirty years , the condensed matter physics community has been fascinated by topological phases of matter , for instance , the integer quantum hall effect ,  @xcite the fractional quantum hall effect ,  @xcite the quantum anomalous hall effect ,  @xcite the quantum spin hall effect ,  @xcite and the three - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "@xcite these topological states of quantum matter are usually distinguished by use of some global topological quantum numbers  @xcite rather than certain local order parameters .",
    "the topological aspect of the integer quantum hall effect with periodic potentials was first discussed by thouless , kohmoto , nightingale , and nijs ( tknn ) .",
    "@xcite in their famous work , a topological expression for the hall conductivity was given by the chern number over the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "their result was then generalized to the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite for the quantum spin hall systems , with the extension of the idea , the well - defined spin chern number can be used to characterize trivial and non - trivial bulk band topology .",
    "@xcite    while simplification exists for pure systems  @xcite , calculation of the chern number in the presence of disorder is usually based upon the integral of partial derivatives of electron wave functions over the boundary phases .",
    "@xcite numerical implementation involves hundreds of times of exact diagonalization for a given disorder configuration  @xcite , which is very time - consuming even for noninteracting electron systems .",
    "recently , several different approaches for the chern number computation in real space have been suggested in the literature .",
    "kitaev  @xcite proposed a real space chern number formula for a lattice model in terms of traces of the coordinate operator and projection operator . a recent work similar to kitaev s one",
    "was numerically realized by bianco and resta  @xcite , and they generalized the result to the systems with open boundary conditions . in the presence of disorder , however , the idea of supercells ,  @xcite namely , a periodic duplication of the actual system is needed , which greatly increases the computation time . based upon the noncommutative chern number theory , prodan @xmath0 @xmath1  @xcite proposed an efficient method to calculate the chern number of disordered systems , in which the procedure of the exact diagonalization is greatly simplified .",
    "however , it involves somewhat complicated multiple commutators between the coordinate operators and projection operators . in some cases ,",
    "the chern number can be extracted indirectly from the transport coefficients , which can be relatively easily calculated from the kubo formula  @xcite . in some other cases , direct calculation of the topological number of bulk wavefunctions is often needed and sometimes irreplaceable . therefore , development of efficient numerical approaches to direct calculation of the chern number is highly desirable .    in this work ,",
    "we provide an alternative way to calculate the chern number , in which only one time exact diagonalization for the actual system is needed without loss of accuracy .",
    "a transparent coupling - matrix formulation will be given , from which the chern number can be very efficiently computed , compared with the existing approaches .",
    "to show its effectiveness , this approach is applied to both the haldane model and the hofstadter model .",
    "the calculated chern number is found well quantized provided the fermi level lies within the energy gap , even when the sample size is not very large . the topological phase transition from the quantum hall insulator to an ordinary insulator",
    "can be determined based upon the calculated chern number , and the obtained critical disorder strength is in good agreement with the result previously obtained from the hall conductivity calculation .    in the next section",
    ", we present the new approach of calculating the chern number . in sec .",
    "iii , for the haldane model , it is shown that the present approach works well for both crystalline and disordered systems . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply the approach to the lattice hofstadter model and the calculated results are in accordance with already existing results .",
    "the final section is a summary .",
    "we now consider a two dimensional ( 2d ) lattice with @xmath2 unit cells .",
    "we use @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 as integers to index the position of a unit cell .",
    "we can define twisted boundary conditions for a single - particle wavefunction of the system @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the wavefunction is in general a row vector in the space of inner degrees of freedom , such as spin and sublattice .",
    "the system is assumed to have @xmath10 electrons , and in the ground state the wavefunctions of the @xmath10 occupied single - particle electron states are denoted by @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the many - body wavefunction of the ground state @xmath13 is the slater determinant of the single - particle wavefunctions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 with @xmath16 is the coordinate of the @xmath17-th electron .",
    "the chern number of the gound state is given by  @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 denoting the @xmath20 space , which is essentially a torus .",
    "we transform the single - particle eigenstate from real space to momentum space through a fourier transform ( ft ) @xmath21 the twisted boundary conditions require that the momenta take only the discrete values @xmath22 , where @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the set of @xmath27 are actually the discrete momenta for periodic boundary conditions",
    ". we will denote @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to find that the many - body wavefunction of the ground state in the momentum space @xmath30 is the slater determinant of @xmath31 . by means of the substitution @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the chern number is derived to be @xmath34 where the inner product includes a summation over @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denotes the rectangle of @xmath37\\times[0,\\frac{2\\pi}{l_{y}}]$ ] .",

    "the chern number given in eq .",
    "( [ new2 ] ) is expressed as a winding number along closed path @xmath42 .",
    "we can divide @xmath42 into @xmath43 small line segments with @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) as their endpoints . in each segment",
    ", one can replace the derivatives in eq.([new2 ] ) by discrete differences and the integral by a summation , yielding @xmath46\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 stands for the principal argument , and @xmath48 is a @xmath49 coupling matrix ,  @xcite with elements @xmath50 . here , we have used the relation @xmath51 .",
    "equivalently , one can first multiply the coupling matrices @xmath52 , and then diagonalize @xmath53 .",
    "the chern number is given by the sum of the phases of the eigenvalues of @xmath53 divided by @xmath54 .",
    "in practice , it is sufficient to take @xmath55 and @xmath44 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) to be the four vertices of @xmath36 shown in fig .",
    "[ geo ] , when @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for these @xmath61 , @xmath62 still belong to the set of @xmath35 , so all the quantities that are needed for the calculation of the chern number can be obtained in the system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , using the inverse ft , the matrix elements of the coupling matrix @xmath48 can be expressed in real space as @xmath63 here , @xmath64 with @xmath65 are the single - particle wave functions of the occupied electron states for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the product of the coupling matrices @xmath66 is first diagonalized to find @xmath10 eigenvalues denoted as @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 is not hamiltian , its eigenvalues @xmath67 are usually complex numbers",
    ". then the chern number is given by @xmath69 where the range of the principal argument function @xmath47 is taken to be @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "we mention that @xmath68 tends to be diagonal when @xmath10 is sufficiently large  @xcite , so the sum of the phases of all the diagonal elements in @xmath68 divided by @xmath54 yields a good approximation to the chern number .",
    "prodan , hughes , and bernevig  @xcite proposed an efficient numerical approach to the chern number , by extending the formula for pure systems straightforwardly to disordered systems .",
    "their expression is also in real space , which however involves multiple commutators of the coordinate operators and projection operator , and is unlikely reducible to a single term .",
    "our method has the advantage that the formula contains only a single term and is more physically transparent . in the next two sections",
    ", numerical calculations will be carried out to show the validity and efficiency of this formula for calculating the chern number .",
    "let us consider the haldane model  @xcite for the quantum anomalous hall effect defined on a honeycomb lattice , including a random on - site disorder potential @xmath71 here , the first term describes the usual nearest - neighbor hopping with the hopping integral being taken to be unity , and the second term stands for the next - nearest - neighbor hopping with a complex hopping integral and @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath73 are two next nearest neighbor sites and @xmath74 their common nearest neighbor .",
    "the vector @xmath75 points from @xmath74 to @xmath17 , and the distance between two nearest neighbor sites is taken to be unity .",
    "the third term represents a random on - site potential , with @xmath76 uniformly distributed between [ @xmath77 , @xmath77 ] .",
    "it is known  @xcite that in the absence of disorder , the energy spectrum of the haldane model has a middle band gap between @xmath79 and @xmath80 . when the fermi energy lies in the band gap , the system shows a quantized hall conductivity @xmath81 , without an applied magnetic field .     for @xmath82 , for several different disorder strengths",

    "[ haldane1 ] . in the absence of disorder ( @xmath85 ) , the chern number is well quantized to 1 within the middle band gap , which is consistent with the known result  @xcite . with increasing disorder strength , the @xmath86 plateau narrows , manifesting the levitation and pair annihilation  @xcite of extended states for the valence and conduction bands , whose chern numbers have opposite signs . the calculated chern number at a fixed fermi energy ( @xmath87 ) for @xmath88 as a function of disorder strength is plotted in fig.[haldane3 ] for different sample sizes .",
    "it is found that the chern number is robust against weak disorder @xmath89 .",
    "with increasing @xmath90 from 4 to 6 , the chern number continuously decreases to nearly zero . with increasing the sample size , the transition process becomes sharper and sharper , which conforms the expectation that the transition should become a sudden drop from 1 to 0 in the thermodynamic limit .     at @xmath88 , for several different sample sizes .",

    "the original band splits into @xmath97 landau levels for mutually prime integers @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the special case of @xmath99 has been widely studied in previous works .  @xcite it was found that each landau band carries a chern number @xmath100 except the band at the center ( @xmath87 ) which carries a negative chern number @xmath101 for odd @xmath97 or @xmath102 for even @xmath97 .",
    "figure  [ flat ] shows the calculated chern number as a function of the fermi energy at @xmath103 for a sample of size n=@xmath104 .",
