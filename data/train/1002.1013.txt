    "among all the processes manifested in stellar coronae , flares are the most energetic ones .",
    "they are supposed to be the result of the energy release from magnetic field reconnection in the lower corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , electrons and ions in the reconnection region are accelerated downwards , along the magnetic field lines , toward lower atmospheric layers . when they reach the upper chromosphere , the local gas is heated and evaporated into the new - formed magnetic loops .",
    "thus , the density and temperature of these loops increase , causing intense emission of soft ( @xmath4  kev ) x - rays .",
    "stellar flares have been observed in almost all the diagram ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",

    "long - duration flares are more common in pre - main sequence stars than in the uv ceti - type ones .",
    "for example , during the 13 days observing run of the orion nebula complex by _ chandra _ , at least 19 flares with durations above half a day were detected @xcite .",
    "long - duration flares were also observed in the taurus star - forming complex @xcite . the longer duration of these events is usually attributed to the presence of larger coronal structures in young stars .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ missions have contributed enormously to the understanding of the processes involved in the x - ray emission of late - type stars . in particular , the improved temporal and spectral resolution , together with the development of theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the existence of intense , sustained heating is needed to explain the maintenance of plasma at temperatures around 56mk . the evolution of the rest of the emd curve can be interpreted as the cooling of the continuously new appearing very hot plasma together with heated material that evaporates from lower layers and fills the flaring loops . * during time - segments 8 and 9 the emission at temperatures @xmath134mk turns back to the level found at the quiescent state , which is an indication of the strong heating not being present any more .",

    "but , what kind of magnetic structures are producing each one of these events ? according to @xcite , multiple loop structures can be involved in a flare , but this frequently occurs only in its late phases .",
    "the initial phases of an x - ray flare are usually quite localized and one can reasonably assume the presence of a single dominant loop ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this assumption is realistic enough in most of the observed rise phases , where the impulsive heating typically involves a dominant loop ( while later residual heating may be released in other similar adjacent loops ) . the clear evidence of a delay between the temperature peak and the density peak is consistent with a single loop model , at least until the moment in which this maximum density is reached .",
    "this delay is often observed both in solar flares , and in stellar flares , even in very long ones @xcite .",
    "the presence of this delay is indeed a signature of a relatively short heat pulse ( the larger the delay , the shorter the heat pulse is ) and of the coherent hydrodynamic evolution of plasma confined in a loop .",
    "arcades and two - ribbon flares are instead characterized by strong and/or lasting heating @xcite and/or irregular light curves @xcite .",
    "thus , event a is likely characterized ( or dominated ) by a single flaring loop since its ignition occurs only at time - segment 1 ( as suggested by the plasma appearing at very high temperatures in its corresponding emd , see @xmath132  [ sec : emds ] ) and shows a delay between the temperature peak and the density peak reached by the flaring plasma in it ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",

    "continual reconnections in an arcade may also be responsible for event b. however , in this case one would expect a more irregular pattern in the light curve than that observed in fig .

    "b , we used the two - ribbon flare model by @xcite extended to the stellar case @xcite .",
    "this model supposes that a disruptive event opens a loop arcade , being the open field lines then driven toward a radial neutral sheet ( above the magnetic neutral line ) where they reconnect at progressively higher altitudes .",
    "thus , the continuous heating provided by these reconnections is capable of reproducing the temporal profile of the energy rate released during both the rise and decay phases of a two - ribbon flare . by analogy to that observed on the sun , the model considers that the arcade of loops is extended along the east - west direction ( i.e. , axial symmetry around the polar axis is assumed ) .",
    "it also assumes that the magnetic field is potential between the stellar surface and the location of the neutral line and extends radially outwards from there . the magnetic field in the meridional planes of the arcade",
    "can therefore be expressed in terms of a single lobe of a legendre polynomial of degree @xmath174 . note that :    1 .",
    "each lobe is latitudinally bounded by radial magnetic fields .",
    "2 .   the arcade corresponds to one lobe axisymmetrically continued over some longitude in the east - west direction .",
    "3 .   through an appropriate choice of @xmath174 , one can find a lobe placed in the range of latitudes covered by the active region .",
    "however , as spatial information is available only for the sun , stellar flaring regions are generally assumed to be centered on the equator for odd @xmath174 and to end at the equator for even @xmath174 .",
    "as stellar observations can not provide any information on the time - dependent rise of the neutral point , it is assumed to mimic the solar case .",
    "thus , it follows an exponential law of the form given by eq .",
    "[ eq : neutralpoint ] , where @xmath175 is the height of the neutral point ( in units of @xmath7 , measured from the star s center ) , @xmath176 is the time ( measured from the beginning of the two - ribbon flare , @xmath177 ) , @xmath178 is a time - constant , and @xmath179 is the maximum height reached by the reconnection point during its upward movement ( measured from the star s surface ) .",
    "@xmath179 is typically chosen to be equal to the latitudinal extent of the arcade , which is in turn linked with @xmath174 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : hmn1 ] and  [ eq : hmn2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath180    under all these assumptions , the rate of magnetic energy released by the reconnecting arcade per radian of longitude ( @xmath181 ) can be expressed as :    @xmath182}{[n + ( n+1 ) y^{2n+1}]^3 }           \\left ( \\frac{dy}{dt } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath183 evaluated between the latitudinal borders of the lobe , @xmath184 is the legendre polynomial of degree @xmath174 , @xmath185 is the co - latitude , @xmath186 is the co - latitude of either boundary of the lobe , and @xmath187 is the maximum surface magnetic field in the active region .",
    "the factor @xmath188 merely defines the normalization of the energy release light curve , while @xmath178 and @xmath174 determine its shape . as eq .",
    "[ eq : dedt ] is given per radian of longitude , a length ( @xmath189 ) must be assumed for the arcade in order to calculate its total energy - release rate .",
    "solar two - ribbon flares occur in loop arcades whose length is typically about 1.5 times their width ( @xmath190 ) . in our study , we adopted this ratio for any given @xmath174 .",
    "since , in the view of many authors , the initiation process for the flare itself might be the result of a more rapid ( nearly explosive ) reconnection than the reconnection process about which @xcite and @xcite speak , they stressed that their model is applicable only after the initial flare trigger mechanism is terminated .",
    "in fact , the model seems not to be able to describe the time of impulsive heating and steeply increasing temperatures .",
    "however , the impulsive phase typically ceases before reaching the @xmath191 flare peak level in the soft x - ray bandpass commonly used for stellar observations . at this time in our observations , the temperature is gradually decreasing .",
    "hence , the model is applicable from time - segment 4 of the light curve to the end of our observations ( time - segment 3 is rejected also for avoiding possible contamination from the decay of event a ) .    in order to apply the described model , the photospheric magnetic field in the flaring region ( from which @xmath187 can be determinated ) , and its latitudinal location and size ( which dictate @xmath174 )",
    "should be known . in the solar case , observations provide all these data , whereas in the stellar case , at best , they can only be inferred indirectly . since we are unaware of the location , size , and magnetic field strength of the active region that we are studying , we treated @xmath174 and @xmath187 as free parameters to be determined from the best fit of the model to the observations .",
    "we created a grid of values for the free parameters @xmath174 , @xmath178 , and @xmath177 to fit event b with the two - ribbon flare model ( the lower limit of @xmath177 was fixed at the beginning of the whole enhancement because of obvious physical reasons ) .",
    "for each set of these parameters , we determined the @xmath187 that best fit the data by minimizing the @xmath192 value , which is defined as :    @xmath193    where @xmath194 is the expected luminosity from the model ( @xmath195 ) , @xmath196 is the observed luminosity , @xmath197 is the error in the observed luminosity , and @xmath198 the number of time - intervals with which we fitted the two - ribbon model ( from time - segment 4 to 9 ) . following the solar analogy ( * ? ? ? *",
    "see @xmath132  [ sec : int ] ) , we assumed the measured radiative losses in the x - ray band to be @xmath199 of the thermal energy generated as consequence of magnetic reconnections , that is @xmath200 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "actually , only a fraction ( @xmath201 ) of the liberated magnetic energy is indeed used to heat the plasma ( thermal energy that is subsequently lost via radiation and conduction ) , while the rest is transformed into mechanical energy , into fast particles ejected from the corona , etc . at this point , we want to notice that we did not find a unique solution corresponding to a single set of parameters , but a number of solutions producing a good fit ( @xmath202 ) .    in table",
    "[ tab4 ] , we show the two - ribbon flare parameters for some of the good fits we have obtained .",
    "we plot these results together with the observations in fig .",
    "other good fits were found also for larger values of @xmath174 ( i.e. , active regions with smaller width and , therefore , shorter loops ) , but note that a smaller active region needs higher surface magnetic fields for reproducing a given energy - release rate .",
    "thus , loop systems that reach larger altitudes   i.e. , small values of @xmath174   may be more realistic in our case , although other loop configurations can not be excluded ( see @xmath132  [ s : fluor ] ) .",
    "( see table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "note that each set of parameters in table  [ tab4 ] produces similar results in the fitted region while having different slopes in the previous part and in the decay .",
    "the light curve segments used to fit the two - ribbon model ( time - segments 49 , see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is shown with a solid line .",
    "the dashed line is the model .",
    "we have also plotted the average values of the model in each time - interval during event b ( dotted line ) for a clearer comparison between the observed light curve and the model .

    "during the inspection of the x - ray spectrum in the different time - intervals , we observed a feature ( excess emission not reproduced by the plasma model ) close to the fe k@xmath225 line at redder wavelengths .",

    "the analysis of the light curve , of the hardness - ratio curve , and of the time - resolved spectra consistently indicates that probably the flare first involved mainly a single loop and then propagated to a loop arcade becoming a proper two - ribbon flare .",
    "we split our analysis into three parts : the quiescent state , the single - loop flare ( event a ) , and the two - ribbon system ( event b ) .",
    "event a was studied with the analysis described in @xcite . for event",
    "b , we used the stellar version of the @xcite s solar two - ribbon flare model that is able to provide some limited information about the late flaring structures .",
    "for the single loop , we obtained a semi - length of approximately @xmath235  cm ( @xmath145  r@xmath236 ) , with a volume @xmath237  @xmath149 and a cross - section @xmath238 .",
