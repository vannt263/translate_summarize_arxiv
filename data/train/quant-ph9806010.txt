    "\\3 ) we operate now on qubit @xmath59 as we did in section iv , so that at some time @xmath83 : @xmath84 this is done by introducing the one - qubit hamiltonian @xmath85 , with @xmath86 and ground state @xmath87 , and by putting the qubit in interaction with a heat - bath whose temperature is lowered down close to zero .",

    "we assume to be in the `` good '' everett universe ( until different notice ) .",

    "condition ( ii ) keeps all @xmath104 and @xmath105 unaltered throughout the evolution , as readily checked . at time @xmath90 :    @xmath106    by measuring the network at time @xmath83 , and by repeating the overall process for a sufficient number of times , a straightforward application of probability theory shows that the number of repetitions required to check whether the network is satisfiable ( with any desired probability that this check is correct ) grows polynomially with network size .",
    "furthermore , @xmath83 is independent of network size .",
    "this would mean np - complete = p.",
    "however , this result can be completely vanified if the probability of finding the network in the `` good '' universe decreases exponentially with network size . to find out how this probability decreases",
    ", we should compute how the qubit @xmath103-heat - bath interaction affects @xmath96 and @xmath107 . doing this",
    "would require a level of formalization beyond the reach of the current study .",
    "anyway , one ingredient of the `` quantum computation speed - up '' consists of substituting interaction , which requires time , with interference , which requires no time .",
    "particle statistics , in the current interpretation , works as interference and implements most of the network logical constraints .",
    "this , in a still generic way , should justify the hope of achieving a computation speed - up by using particle statistics .",
    "we have highlighted an alternative way of approaching quantum computation . with respect to time - sequential computation",
    "( section i ) , it presents some significant differences :    * logical constraints are simultaneous in time rather than being mapped on the time evolution of the computation process ; * there is thus an analogy between such constraints and the simultaneous constraints ( also logical in character ) established by particle statistics ; * in order to make this analogy explicit , we must introduce a blunt interpretation of particle statistics .",
    "a particle statistics symmetry would no more be a passive constant of motion which does nothing to a unitary evolution , but an active watchdog effect shaping that evolution ; * the np - complete sat problem is in a way native in this approach .",
    "the counterfactual interpretation of particle statistics might be interesting in itself .",
    "checking it might not be out of reach .",
    "the link behaviour ( section iv ) is similar to exchange interaction .",
    "one should devise an experimental situation , showing that an operation on one part drags the state of the other part according to the formulation propounded .",
    "we should finally note that this formulation of particle statistics can be represented in a two - way ( advanced and retarded ) propagation model .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] and can be outlined as follows .",
    "we have been dealing with state vector reduction on a _ predetermined _ subspace , namely always on the constrained subspace @xmath108 never on the orthogonal subspace violating the constraint .",
    "although elusively ( since we are in counterfactual reasoning ) , this means an evolution affected by a condition coming from the future .",
