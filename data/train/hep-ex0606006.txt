    "liquid argon tpcs are a most promising technique for the study of several fundamental topics of particle physics : neutrino properties , proton decay and dark matter . after an extensive r&d programme ,",
    "the icarus collaboration was able to operate at shallow depth a detector of 600 tons ( t600 )  @xcite .",
    "the successful completion of a series of technical tests has shown that the liquid argon technique is now mature .",
    "the sample of cosmic ray events recorded have provided us with a statistically significant data set of unprecedented quality .",
    "long muon tracks , stopping muons , muon bundles , hadronic and electromagnetic showers as well as low energy events have been studied and results have been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the t600 detector is now at the infn gran sasso laboratory .",
    "it is being installed to be operated underground .",
    "its physics programme has been reviewed in  @xcite . among the different non - accelerator physics topics that can be covered with such a detector",
    ", the study of atmospheric neutrinos is particularly important .",
    "thanks to its high granularity , icarus can separate , for all neutrino species , charged current and neutral current events down to production thresholds and free of detector biases .",
    "therefore it provides a data set of very high quality ( specially in the sub gev region ) and almost free of systematic uncertainties ( which are nowadays the limiting factor in the study of atmospheric neutrino oscillations ) .",
    "atmospheric @xmath0 charged current interactions will produce prompt muons with mean energy of several hundreds of mev .",
    "they will have travel paths of several meters , since minimum ionizing particles deposit about 210 mev per meter in argon .",
    "however due to the reduced transverse dimensions of the t600 detector , a large fraction of the recorded @xmath0 charged current will be partially contained .",
    "calorimetric measurements will be highly inadequate to study this sort of events . to extract valuable kinematic information from them",
    ", we can take advantage of the multiple coulomb scattering underwent by muons as they propagate through liquid argon .",
    "momentum measurement of partially contained tracks will be performed in a way much similar to the one used in emulsion experiments .",
    "together with this method , we try to apply a new technique , known as kalman filter  @xcite , in oder to obtain a more precise measurement of the particle momenta .",
    "this article is organized as follows : section  [ sec : t600 ] gives a brief outline of the detector . in section  [ sec : recons ] we discuss the technical aspects of the monte - carlo simulation and event reconstruction .",
    "section  [ sec : ms ] describes what we called the _ classical _ approach to momentum measurement by means of multiple coulomb scattering . in sections  [ sec : kf ] and",
    "[ sec : kfmc ] we briefly introduce the kalman filter technique and how it can be used to obtain an estimation of momenta for through - going particles .",
    "section  [ sec : comparison ] compares the performance of the two algorithms . to evaluate the goodness of the kalman filter method",
    ", section  [ sec : kfrealdata ] describes the results obtained when the kalman filter algorithm is applied to real data : in our case , a sample of atmospheric stopping muons .",
    "conclusions are finally drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the icarus t600 liquid argon ( lar ) detector  @xcite consists of a large cryostat split in two identical , adjacent half - modules , with internal dimensions @xmath2 m@xmath3 each of them .",
    "each half - module is an independent unit housing an internal detector composed by two time projection chambers ( tpc ) , a field shaping system , monitors , probes , and two arrays of photo - multipliers . externally",
    "the cryostat is surrounded by a set of thermal insulation layers . the tpc wire read - out electronics is located on the top side of the cryostat .",
    "the detector layout is completed by a cryogenic plant made of a liquid nitrogen cooling circuit to maintain uniform the lar temperature , and of a system of lar purifiers .",
    "a liquid argon tpc detects the ionization charge released at the passage of charged particles in the volume of lar , thus providing three dimensional image reconstruction and calorimetric measurement of ionizing events .",
    "the detector , equipped with an electronic read - out system , works as an `` electronic bubble chamber '' employing lar as ionization medium .",
    "an uniform electric field applied to the medium makes the ionization electrons drift onto the anode ; thanks to the low transverse diffusion of the ionization charge , the electron images of ionizing tracks are preserved .",
    "successive anode wire planes , biased at a different potential and oriented at different angles , make possible the three dimensional reconstruction of the track image . in each t600 half - module ,",
    "the two identical tpcs are separated by a common cathode .",
    "each tpc consists of three parallel wire planes : the first , facing the drift region , with horizontal wires ( induction plane ) ; the other two with the wires at @xmath4 from the horizontal direction ( induction and collection planes , respectively ) .",
    "the wire pitch is 3  mm . the maximum drift path ( distance between the cathode and the wire planes ) is 1.5  m and the nominal drift field 500  v / cm .",
    "the measured drift velocity is @xmath5 mm/@xmath6s  @xcite .",
    "each wire of the chamber is independently digitized every 400  ns . the electronics was designed to allow continuous read - out , digitization and independent waveform recording of signals from each wire of the tpc .",
    "measurement of the time when the ionizing event occurred ( so called `` @xmath7 time '' of the event ) , together with the electron drift velocity information , provides the absolute position of the tracks along the drift coordinate .",
    "the @xmath7 can be determined by detection of the prompt scintillation light produced by ionizing particles in lar  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to understand how accurately we can measure the momentum of charged particles that traverse the t600 detector without stopping . to this purpose ,",
    "we have carried out a full simulation of muons that span a momentum range going from 250 mev up to 6 gev .",
    "this is the relevant energy range for the study of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the fluka package  @xcite has been used to simulate all relevant physics processes ( multiple coulomb scattering , delta ray production , muon decay , energy loss by ionization , ... ) .",
    "the detector geometry has been simulated according to the detector description given in section  [ sec : t600 ] .",
    "special care was put in reproducing the same experimental conditions met when the t600 test at shallow depth was carried out .",
    "therefore we included a detailed simulation of the noise and of the electronic response of the detector .",
    "the event reconstruction proceeded as follows : the wire output signals were used to identify hits ( segment of track whose energy is recorded by a wire ) .",
    "hits are fit in order to extract physical information ( deposited charged , time and position ) . in a latter step , hits are grouped into clusters . from them",
    ", we reconstruct two dimensional tracks for each of the three wire planes ( one collection and two induction views ) .",
    "finally the spatial coordinates of the charged track ( 3d reconstruction ) are obtained matching the hits of the 2d tracks previously reconstructed . the key point for 3d reconstruction",
    "is the fact that the drift coordinate is common to all three planes .",
    "this redundancy allows to associate hits from different planes to a common energy deposition .",
    "finally 3d tracks are used to extract the information provided by multiple coulomb scattering , and thus get a measurement of the track momentum .",
    "the same procedure was used to reconstruct the real data sample of stopping muons used in section  [ sec : kfrealdata ] .    to exemplify how the reconstruction software works , figure  [ fig : mcevt ] shows a view of a 0.5 gev stopping muon(left panel ) and its three - dimensional reconstruction ( right panel ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we note here an intrinsic limitation of the kalman filter method .",
    "it is well known that deviations from the original trajectory , due to multiple scattering , become smaller as momentum increases .",
    "detector noise starts playing a more important role and it becomes necessary to go to longer segment lengths to observe multiple scattering effects .",
    "therefore for much higher momenta , a different set of segment lengths should be used . in the limit of very high momentum , o(10 gev ) ,",
    "when multiple scattering effects are small , the kalman filter procedure is not able to give a proper estimation of the particle momentum .",
    "we have discussed separately two algorithms aiming at measuring the momentum of partially contained tracks . to summarize the most relevant points ,",
    "we now compare the performance of both methods .",
    "the comparison is based on monte - carlo data .",
    "figures  [ fig : compcal ] and [ fig : compres ] show the calibration curve and the resolutions obtained using the two methods .",
    "= 11.0cm=11.0 cm    in figure  [ fig : compcal ] , the solid line shows the case where @xmath8 .",
    "the points from the _ classical _ analysis are clearly below the line because of the energy lost by the muon along its path . for this approach ,",
    "the error bars correspond to the rms of each single distribution ( similar to those shown in figure  [ fig : multscatt_inverse_histo ] ) .",
    "the kalman filter gives a much better estimation , since it takes into account energy losses .",
    "for this algorithm , the error is taken as the rms of the gaussian fit to the individual momentum distributions similar to those of figure  [ fig : histo ] .",
    "within one standard deviation , the kalman filter does not underestimate muon momentum .",
    "therefore , contrary to the _ classical _ method where we calculate the mean momentum along the track , with the kalman filter the momentum at each plane can be calculated , and in particular , we can get a measurement of the most relevant magnitude , namely : the momentum at the initial plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : compres ] shows the momentum resolution .",
    "for the _ classical _ approach it is on the range 2520 % . there is an increase of the resolution at the edges : for small momenta , where the range of lengths and the number of segments is small , and for high momenta , where the effect of the multiple scattering decreases .    with the kalman filter technique , the resolutions are around 10% for the whole range of studied momenta , except at 250  mev where the resolution is close to 25% .",
    "this increase is easily understandable given the short track lengths involved .",
    "a 250  mev muon has a typical length of less than 1 meter .",
    "the amount of planes in which it can be split is small .",
    "hence the method does not have enough information to provide an accurate measurement . in spite of that , 250  mev events are typically fully contained and measured by calorimetry with a very good resolution .",
    "the inclusion of this energy in the analysis was motivated by the aim to find the limits of the method .",
    "= 10.0cm=10.0 cm    we have also studied how the momentum resolution gets affected as the recorded track length gets shorter .",
    "this is specially important for the case of several gev muons .",
    "figure  [ fig : kflength ] shows , for the range of considered momenta , the expected resolutions when recorded tracks are 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 and 250 cm long .",
    "we observed that , for all lengths , the momentum scale is not underestimated on average .",
    "resolutions keep themselves in the interval 2025@xmath9 . only for the shortest considered tracks ( 50 cm ) ,",
    "the resolution worsens up to 30@xmath9 .",
    "we conclude that , for tracks of a few gev , the kalman filter allows to have a reasonable estimate of the charged particle momenta even if the recorded tracks are no longer than a meter .",
    "= 11.0cm=11.0 cm    in conclusion , with the _ classical _ approach we expect resolutions in the range 2520 % and a underestimation of the momentum value .",
    "the results obtained with the kalman filter do not underestimate momentum and improve the resolution by almost a factor two .",
    "in addition , we notice that both methods exhibit a similar behavior at low energies , with an increase in the error with respect to the almost constant one for the rest of energies .",
    "this behavior appears at 500  mev for the classical method and only at 250  mev for the kalman filter . in both cases",
    "the error increase has to do with the length of the tracks and the small amount of available segments .",
    "so far , we have just relied on monte - carlo data to show that the kalman filter is an optimal tool to estimate the momentum of partially contained tracks .",
    "we now try to assess the goodness of this algorithm by applying it to real data . the sample we take as reference corresponds to a set of stopping atmospheric muons collected on the summer of 2001 during a t600 technical run on surface .",
    "the initial set contains the 2690 events used in  @xcite .",
    "we impose the condition that , in the collection view , muons should have at least 60 hits and a minimum track length of 50 cm .",
    "these requirements leave us with a final sample of 1009 muons .",
    "given the characteristics of the selected muons , the range of considered momenta spans from about 200 mev up to 800 mev ( being the mean value 400 mev ) . for higher momenta , the sample of recorded muons is not statistically significant .",
    "the monte - carlo tells us that the kalman filter performance for the lower momentum range is not as good as the one expected for muons above 1 gev .",
    "however a demonstration that the method performs reasonably well in the low momentum range , will give us confidence on the fact that the algorithm can be also applied at higher momenta .",
    "the selected data have been reconstructed following the procedure outlined in section  [ sec : recons ] .",
    "being fully contained , the momentum of those muons can be very accurately measured using a calorimetric approach .",
    "when computing momentum by means of calorimetry , recombination effects should be taken into account .",
    "equation  [ eq : calor ] relates measured and deposited charges , being r the electron recombination factor in liquid argon :    @xmath10    we take from  @xcite the value @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 stands for the drift mean life of the electrons and its value is taken from  @xcite . the error associated to @xmath12",
    "is propagated to the momentum measured by calorimetry .",
    "it amounts to less than five per cent . in our approach",
    "we consider the momentum measured by calorimetry , @xmath13 , as the _ true _ momentum value . on a track by track basis , we compare the momentum obtained with the kalman filter , @xmath14 , to @xmath13 . the results are shown in figures  [ fig : profile ] and  [ fig : disper ] .",
    "we plot the profile of the analyzed data set in figure  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "it shows that , on average , our measurements tend to cluster around the solid line , which depicts the ideal condition where @xmath15 . in the high momentum region , the decrease of statistics results in bigger fluctuations around the central line . from the plot",
    "we infer that the relationship among the two performed measurements is clearly linear , thus showing that the kalman filter gives a good measurement of real data momentum .",
    "= 10.0cm=10.0 cm    we also plot the dispersion of the kalman filter measurements with respect to @xmath13 in figure  [ fig : disper ] .",
    "for each of the six momentum bins into which we group the data , the mean dispersion is very close to zero .",
    "the error bars correspond to the rms of each individual distribution . for the lowest momenta ,",
    "the error is around 20@xmath9 . as the momentum increases , the error bar diminishes reaching a minimum value of about 12@xmath9 .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with the resolutions obtained , for the low momentum range , in our monte - carlo simulation ( see figure  [ fig : compres ] ) . in view of these results , we conclude that real data confirm the fact that the kalman filter algorithm , when combined with multiple coulomb scattering information , is an optimal method to obtain an accurate measurement of partially contained track momenta .",
    "= 10.0cm=10.0 cm",
    "we have addressed the problem of measuring the momentum of partially contained charged particles recorded with the 600 ton icarus detector .",
    "this is a fundamental issue in our effort to study very precisely atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we have analyzed the performance of two independent approaches :    * the one referred to as _ classical _ extracts the momentum from the distribution of scattering angles measured along the particle trajectory .",
    "we have proposed an algorithm that avoids defining an optimized segment length for the computation of the scattering angles . *",
    "the second method is based on a kalman filter .",
    "we have explored , for the first time , the possibility to apply this algorithm in an homogeneous , non - magnetized environment .",
    "this method takes all measurements into account to predict the future dynamical behaviour of the considered system .",
    "therefore , unlike the _ classical _ approach , where the set of reconstructed track segments is just a collection of unrelated measurements , the kalman filter does take correlations into account ( in particular , energy losses are automatically included ) .    with the _",
    "classical _ method , the momentum is underestimated ( since energy losses are not considered ) .",
    "the expected resolutions lie around 25@xmath9 for a range of momenta ranging from 250 mev up to 3 gev . with the kalman filter ,",
    "momentum is not underestimated and the expected resolutions improve by a factor two those obtained with the _ classical _ method .",
    "we have also observed that , for tracks with momentum in the vicinity of 1 gev or higher , the kalman filter provides a reasonable momentum measurement , even in the case the recorded tracks are around one meter long .    to assess the goodness of the kalman filter approach , we have used a set of real data composed of atmospheric muons that stop inside the detector .",
    "the momentum of those muons is very precisely measured by calorimetry .",
    "the momentum estimation provided by the kalman filter shows a very good agreement with calorimetric measurements , proving the validity of the method .",
    "we therefore conclude that the kalman filter approach is an excellent tool to get precise kinematics information of the set of partially contained atmospheric neutrino events that we expect to record at the gran sasso underground laboratory .",
    "we would like to warmly thank the many technical collaborators that contributed to the construction of the detector and to its operation .",
    "we are glad of the financial and technical support of our funding agencies and in particular of the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare ( infn ) , of eth zrich and of the fonds national suisse de la recherche scientifique , switzerland .",
