    "recently the detection of primordial gravitational waves has been reported by bicep2  @xcite .",
    "the size of the gravitational waves is usually characterized by the so - called tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 and its reported value from bicep2 is @xmath6 which excludes @xmath7 with 7@xmath8  @xcite . however , this large value of @xmath0 is in strong tension with the temperature data from planck in the framework of the standard @xmath9cdm+@xmath0 model which gives the limit @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "some possible extensions of the model to resolve the tension have been discussed since the data release of bicep2 such as the running spectral index  @xcite , the suppression of the adiabatic perturbations on large scales  @xcite , the presence of the extra relativistic particles  @xcite , blue - tilted tensor spectrum  @xcite , the existence of anti - correlated isocurvature mode  @xcite , and so on . among these possibilities ,",
    "we in this paper focus on the model with isocurvature perturbations .",
    "since the constraints on @xmath0 from the temperature data come from the enhancement due to the tensor mode contribution on large scales , if one can reduce the power on large scales , a large tensor mode contribution can be accommodated , which can be realized by assuming the anti - correlated isocurvature mode since it suppresses the tt power spectrum on large scales .",
    "since such anti - correlated isocurvature perturbations can naturally arise in multiple scalar field models such as the curvaton  @xcite , this issue deserves a further study . in this paper , we investigate how the tension can be reduced in a more quantitative way by performing markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis using planck , bicep2 and some other data . to discuss the effects of a broad class of models with isocurvature perturbations , we study not only a case with anti - correlated isocurvature mode , but also a generally correlated one , as well as varying the isocurvature spectral index . as will be discussed",
    ", the existence of the anti - correlated isocurvature mode can allow large contribution from the tensor mode consistent with planck temperature data , which may give a hint of the existence of the isocurvature mode .",
    "it should also be noted that constraints on isocurvature perturbations in the light of bicep2 data are worth investigating on their own .",
    "although the constraints on isocurvature perturbations have been studied in many works , to our knowledge , there are only a few studies on isocurvature perturbations in the existence of the tensor mode  @xcite .",
    "now the bicep2 data indicates that the tensor mode should not be neglected , the investigation of isocurvature perturbations in the presence of the tensor mode would be an important subject .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly give a formalism to discuss the isocurvature perturbations and the effects of isocurvature perturbations and tensor mode in the cmb power spectra .",
    "then in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we describe the method of the analysis . in section [ sec : result ] , we show our results and discuss how the tension between planck and bicep2 data can be resolved by introducing isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion of this paper .",
    "first we summarize the formalism to discuss isocurvature perturbations and set our notations .",
    "isocurvature perturbations for a component @xmath11 is usually defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the curvature perturbation on the uniform energy density hypersurface of @xmath11 and the subscript @xmath0 indicates radiation . although various isocurvature modes have been discussed in the literature ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) ,",
    "we only consider cold dark matter ( cdm ) mode in this paper .",
    "thus in the following , we denote @xmath14 simply as @xmath15 and also the adiabatic curvature perturbations during radiation dominated era @xmath16 simply as @xmath17 . depending on the model ,",
    "the curvature and isocurvature perturbations can be correlated or uncorrelated .",
    "the power spectrum of the initial perturbations @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being either @xmath17 or @xmath15 . to discuss the size and the scale - dependence of the curvature ( adiabatic ) and isocurvature perturbations ,",
    "we characterize the power spectra for the auto- and cross - correlation of @xmath17 and @xmath15 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the amplitude of the power spectra , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are spectral indices for the auto - correlation power spectra of @xmath28 and the cross - correlation one , respectively .",
    "we define these quantities at the reference scale @xmath29 which we adopt @xmath30 for the analysis in this paper .    depending on the model",
    ", the degree of the correlation between the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations varies . to quantify the cross - correlation",
    ", we define the correlation parameter as @xmath31 we denote the cases with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 as positively correlated , negatively ( anti- ) correlated and uncorrelated isocurvature perturbations , respectively .",
    "although the spectral indices can be generally treated as independent parameters , in this paper , we assume the case with @xmath35 , which is motivated by the curvaton model where the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations originate from a single scalar field .",
    "when we consider the case with uncorrelated isocurvature mode , we also investigate a possibility of @xmath36 which is the case for the axion isocurvature model is close to 1 , in some models @xmath26 can be as large as @xmath37  @xcite . ] .    in the analysis , to parameterize the size of isocurvature perturbations , the fraction of their contribution is commonly used and it is defined as @xmath38 since we consider cases with isocurvature perturbations , we define the tensor - to - scalar ratio including the isocurvature one in the scalar part as @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the power spectrum of the tensor mode . besides , we assume a scale - invariant tensor power spectrum , i.e. @xmath41 , throughout this paper .      the contribution of the adiabatic and isocurvature modes to temperature fluctuations can be roughly evaluated by looking at those for the sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect on large scales ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath42 thus the cmb tt angular power spectrum from the sw effect can be written as @xmath43 when the correlation parameter is @xmath44 , @xmath45 can give a negative contribution to the sw effect , which suppresses the power on large scales . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] , cmb tt power spectra are shown for the cases with adiabatic , anti - correlated isocurvature and tensor modes .",
    "as shown in the figure , the spectrum for the anti - correlated isocurvature case is suppressed on large scale , which can cancel the tensor mode contribution .",
    "thus we expect that the inclusion of the anti - correlated isocurvature mode would help to resolve the tension between the temperature data from planck and the observation of b - mode polarization from bicep2 .    in the next section",
    ", we study this issue in a more quantitative way by using a mcmc analysis to fit the model with isocurvature perturbations and tensor mode .",
    "in our analysis , we assume a flat @xmath9cdm model with isocurvature perturbations and a tensor mode , which consists of the following cosmological parameters @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively are the density parameters of baryon and cdm , @xmath49 is the hubble parameter in units of km / sec / mpc , @xmath50 is the optical depth of reionization .",
    "however , we do not vary all of these parameters completely independently . instead",
    ", we often treat some of the parameters for the initial power spectrum as fixed ones or related in some way ( e.g. , we assume @xmath35 for some analysis ) .",
    "we adopt the latest version of cosmomc  @xcite , which allows us to sample the posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters as well as various nuisance parameters which account for the contributions of foregrounds to cmb .    as cmb data ,",
    "we adopt the temperature anisotropy from planck ( hereafter p13 )  @xcite , the e - mode polarization one from wmap 9-year ( wp9 )  @xcite and the e- and b - mode polarization ones from bicep2 ( b2 )  @xcite from the likelihood codes of them .",
    "this is justified since these two data are dominated by the measurement noise and the sample variance is subdominant . ] . in some cases",
    "we also combine the measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation scales @xcite ( bao ) and the direct measurement of the hubble parameter @xcite ( h0 ) .",
    "now we present our result . in table",
    "[ tab : constraints ] , we summarize constraints on cosmological parameters related to the tensor and isocurvature perturbations for various models , which we are to describe in the following",
    ".    .constraints on cosmological parameters related to the tensor and isocurvature perturbations . shown are the 95 % intervals of 1d marginalized posterior distributions for various model and combinations of data sets . [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the conventional cosmology with adiabatic initial perturbations , there has been found a tension between the temperature data from planck and the b - mode one from bicep2 . in this study , we have examined whether this tension can be mitigated by introducing isocurvature perturbations .",
    "we have found that , assuming the anti - correlated isocurvature perturbations , which can be realized in e.g. the curvaton scenario , @xmath51 is reduced by @xmath52 from the case of purely adiabatic perturbations and the constraints on @xmath0 from planck alone and planck combined with bicep2 can be consistent at 68 % c.l .",
    "however , while the level of discrepancy can be reduced , the current data is yet to show a clear evidence for non - vanishing isocurvature perturbations .",
    "we suggest that precise measurements of the cmb polarization in the future are promising to distinguish the anti - correlated isocurvature model from the adiabatic one .",
