    "mid - infrared spectra of galaxies are rich in emission lines , and display prominent broader emission and absorption features due to the presence of various solids and/or large molecules in their interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    "these emission bands are characteristic of c - c and c - h bonds in aromatic molecules . in this paper",
    "we will refer to them as ` pah features ' according to one of the most popular interpretations of their carrier , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "these detections and related work using the iras lrs ( cohen & volk 1989 ) form the basic pre - iso knowledge of mid - infrared spectral features in galaxies .",
    "considerable work has also been done from the ground but has been limited to the features found in atmospheric windows , mainly silicate absorption and pah feature emission in the n band ( e.g. roche et al .",
    "1991 , and references therein ) and the companion pah feature in the l band ( e.g. moorwood 1986 ) .",
    "the restriction to atmospheric windows increases problems in establishing the ` continuum ' on which the features are superposed .",
    "this is a nontrivial task , even with full wavelength coverage , due to the crowding of mid - infrared emission and absorption features ( especially in the 10@xmath1 m region ) .    with the short wavelength spectrometer sws ( de  graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) on board the infrared space observatory iso ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) high spectral resolution observations with good signal - to - noise ( s / n ) were obtained for a number of bright galaxies .",
    "their main advantages lie in continuous wavelength coverage from 2.4 to 45@xmath1 m and in the possibility to clearly separate features from nearby emission lines .",
    "the interpretation of galaxy - integrated spectra strongly benefits from comparisons to similar observations of galactic sources , sometimes spatially resolved , allowing better isolation of the physical mechanisms at work .",

    "1994 ) , in contrast to our starburst templates , where it is not observed .",
    "note , however , that in m82 and ngc253 a similar absorption feature could plausibly exist if the analogy to the galactic center holds , but be filled in by the 3.3/3.4 pah emission . on the other hand m82 and ngc253",
    "show an h@xmath2o ice absorption at 3.0@xmath1 m which is definitely absent in ngc1068 .",
    "these differences in absorption features are entirely plausible because of the different physical conditions in the obscuring regions . for the starbursts , they likely include diffuse ism as well as molecular clouds that can host icy grains . conversely , infrared polarimetry suggests that most of the near - infrared obscuration in ngc1068 occurs within a few parsecs from the nucleus , possibly in the torus ( e.g. packham et al . 1997 ) .",
    "such an energetic environment will be much less favourable for the existence of icy grains .",
    "+ * circinus : * the circinus galaxy is a nearby spiral galaxy which shows seyfert 2 activity ( e.g. moorwood & glass 1984 , oliva et al .",
    "1994 , moorwood et al .",
    "1996 , oliva et al . 1998 ) . due to its proximity ( 5 times closer than ngc1068 ) it has become another template object for the study of agns .",
    "the agn is surrounded by circumnuclear star - forming regions , as is often the case in seyfert nuclei residing in spirals .",
    "the iso - sws observations were centered on the active nucleus , but contrary to the observations of ngc1068 the apertures covered a significant amount of this circumnuclear star formation .",
    "hence , most of the dust emission features seen in the starburst templates are also found in circinus , but with weaker line - to - continuum ratio ( see the discussion in sect . [",
    "s : pah_var ] ) .",
    "a peculiarity of the circinus spectrum are the very pronounced features in the 2022@xmath1 m region .",
    "the observation was performed very early in the mission , when the observing strategy was not yet fully optimized .",
    "for instance , exposures of the internal flux calibration lamps , preceeding observations of the scientific target , caused memory effects in the immediately following scans . the low flux level of band 4 ( @xmath17 29@xmath1 m ) , relative to the preceding bands , is due to such a memory effect and an incorrect dark current subtraction .",
    "the same might be true for the apparent features near 44@xmath1 m ( which are not visible in the overlapping lws spectrum ) .",
    "we did not attempt to improve the dark current subtraction further since this would involve subjective assumptions about the true dark current .",
    "the emission features in this wavelength range have been extensively studied with iso in galactic objects during the last few years .",
    "comprehensive discussions of their identifications and characteristics can be found e.g. in beintema et al .",

    "this is supported by recent laboratory studies ( e.g. roelfsema et al .",
    "1996 , moutou et al .",
    "the only features in this range , which have not been addressed in the literature so far , are the ones at 7.0 and 8.3@xmath1 m . in our sample of galaxies",
    "they are unambiguously detected only in m82 and ngc253 ( the 8.3@xmath1 m feature only in m82 ) , but as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ s : inventory ] they seem to be present in other published spectra as well .",
    "it seems likely that they can be attributed to a pah modes , too .",
    "features in this range have attracted less attention in the past , because they are intrinsically weak ( but see e.g. beintema et al .",
    "these bands , however , are more sensitive to the molecular structure of pahs , since they involve the motion of the molecule as a whole , therefore depending on the exact species ( lger et al .",
    "hence , their observation could help to better constrain the composition of the interstellar mixture .",
    "the 13.6 , 15.8 , and 16.5@xmath1 m features are also visible in the spectra of ngc7023 and have been attributed to pah bands in the past by moutou et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , based on their laboratory work .",

    "moutou et al .",
    "( 1996 ) list a feature at this wavelength in their composite laboratory spectrum of a mixture of pahs . although weak , it might cause confusion with [ ne v ] in low resolution spectra ( see sect . [",
    "s : lowres ] ) . finally , the weak feature at 14.8@xmath1 m ( if real ) could be due to the smallest pah , benzene ( tielens et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the number of modes in the laboratory pah spectra of moutou et al .",
    "( 1996 ) decreases with increasing wavelength .",
    "few species show emission beyond 20@xmath1 m , e.g. near 21 , 28 and 40@xmath1 m . in this wavelength range",
    "other sources must be taken into account .",
    "a number of recent papers have reported the detection of crystalline silicates ( olivines , fosterite , pyroxene , etc . ) in objects like luminous blue variables ( voors et al .",
    "1999 ) , dusty circumstellar disks ( waelkens et al .",
    "1996 , waters et al .",
    "1996 ) , or planetary nebulae ( waters et al .",
    "in particular the feature at 34@xmath1 m could be attributed to these kind of sources .",
    "however , one would expect to see emission features at e.g. 23 , 28 , 40 and 43@xmath1 m , as well ; none of these features are clearly detected in our spectra .",
    "on the other hand , even in some of the galactic templates , such as the planetary nebula ngc6543 ( e.g. waters et al .",
    "1996 ) , not all of these features are present .",
    "a feature near 20.5@xmath1 m shows a striking variation in shape and central wavelength between the galaxies .",
    "this is particularly surprising since the galaxy spectra include a mixture of many different regions , and may suggest a carrier occuring only transiently in very special conditions . in circinus",
    "this feature is most prominent , and peaks at the bluest wavelength ( 20.2@xmath1 m ) .",
    "circinus also shows a second peak at 21.7@xmath1 m which is absent in the other spectra .",
    "a bump around 20.5@xmath1 m is also seen in iso - sws spectra of m supergiants ( voors et al .",
    "1999 , molster et al .",
    ". it could be due to pahs or alternatively metal oxides like feo ( waters et al .",
    "1996 , henning et al .",
    "iras - lrs and iso - sws spectroscopy have also detected a broad feature , centered at approximately 20.1@xmath1 m , in carbon rich stars ( volk et al .",
    "1999 , garca - lario et al . 1999 ,",
    "szczerba et al . 1999 ) .",
    "possible candidates that have been proposed include large pah clusters or hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains , hydrogenated fullerenes , and nano - diamonds ( see references in volk et al .",
    "however , compared to these detections , the features in our spectra are much narrower .",
    "a mixture of fullerene molecules of different degree of hydrogenation ( webster 1995 ) might also explain the second peak in circinus around 21.7@xmath1 m , since the emission peak shifts from 23 for fully hydrogenated fullerene ( c@xmath18h@xmath18 ) to 19@xmath1 m for non - hydrogentated fullerene ( c@xmath18 ) .",
    "none of the other galaxies exhibit this feature , but the sws01 spectrum of nml cyg ( voors et al .",
    "1999 ) and of the galaxy ngc4945 ( s. lord , private communication ) also show a weak emission feature around 21.622@xmath1 m .",
    "the broad plateau at 3334@xmath1 m , i.e. under the strong lines of [ si ii ] and [ s iii ] , could be affected by detector memory effects . to remove such a possible instrumental effect we treated the two different scan directions of the sws01 mode separately .",
    "the trailing wings of each line profile , i.e. the blue wing for the scan with increasing wavelength , and the red wing for the scan decreasing in wavelength , are much more distorted by memory effects than the leading wings .",
    "therefore , we cut out these trailing wings , before we averaged the spectra of the two scan directions .",
    "we are hence confident that most of the remaining plateau is real .",
    "such a feature has been observed in many galactic targets and is generally attributed to crystalline silicates ( olivine , e.g. waters et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "published mid - ir spectra of galactic template sources show a significant variation of intrinsic pah ratios from source to source .",
    "for instance roelfsema et al .",
    "( 1996 ) see a drastic change in the relative intensities of the 7.7 and 8.6 bands with increasing intensity or hardness of the radiation field .",
    "similar changes are seen e.g. in different regions of m17 ( verstraete et al .",
    "1996 ) or - for the 8.6/11.3 ratio - in the reflection nebula ngc1333 ( joblin et al .",
    "pahs exposed to intense and hard radiation fields can be ionized , lose hydrogen atoms , or be photodissociated ; any of these effects may contribute to the observed variations in pah ratios . according to joblin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) the ionization is best traced by the 3.4/3.3 and 8.6/11.3 ratios .",
    "a good hydrogenation indicator is the ( 12 + 12.7)/11.3 ratio .",
    "for instance , these authors find a high 3.4/3.3 ratio of 0.1 in radiation fields that are 10@xmath19 times the standard .",
    "another important factor that can alter observed pah ratios is extinction .",
    "extinction will suppress the 6.2 , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath1 m features with respect to the one at 7.7@xmath1 m .",
    "the 12.7/11.3 ratio is similarly affected , since the 11.3 feature is still in the wing of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption .",
    "details will depend on the applicable extinction law ( see e.g. the galactic center , lutz et al .",
    "while extinction clearly affects pah spectra in highly obscured sources like ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , lutz et al .",
    "1998a ) or the edge - on galaxy ngc4945 ( spoon et al . , in prep . )",
    ", its effect will be less pronounced in the lower extinction sources of our sample .",
    "finally , in active galaxies , such as ngc1068 or the circinus galaxy , pah features can be diluted by an agn - powered hot dust continuum .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and lutz et al .",
    "( 1998a ) have used this as a diagnostic of the power sources of ulirgs .",
    "our sample of galaxy spectra exhibits a similar trend in relative pah strengths as the galactic templates .",
    "m82 and ngc253 have high 3.4/3.3 ratios , consistent with them being active starburst galaxies .",
    "30dor seems to have an even higher 3.4/3.3 ratio , but the s / n ratio is not sufficient for a detailed analysis .",
    "however , a strong and hard , highly ionizing radiation field in 30dor is consistent with the results of thornley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which are based on the ratios of fine structure emission lines , like [ ne iii]/[ne ii ] . in that context",
    "it is interesting to note again the complete absence of the 12.7@xmath1 m feature in 30dor . in the two starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253 we see well - separated 7.6/7.8 and 8.6 features .",
    "the 8.6 band is much weaker than the 7.6/7.8 band , just as observed in ` normal ' hii regions . in the seyfert galaxy ngc1068 , however , the 8.6 band is similar in strength to the 7.7 band , as it is seen in the ultracompact hii regions in m17 ( cesarsky 1996b ) or iras18323 - 0242 ( roelfsema et al . 1996 ) , where the uv radiation field is extremely strong .",
    "ngc1068 , like many agns , shows an additional component of warm dust in the 10@xmath1 m region .",
    "unified models for seyfert galaxies predict a dusty torus which would emit at these mid - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. pier & krolik 1992 ) .",
    "hence , an alternative interpretation of the weak emission features on both sides of the silicate absorption might be self - absorbed silicate emission from the torus , i.e. the emissions we identified as pah might simply be wings of a wide silicate emission maximum , the center of which is suppressed by absorption .",
    "however , the observed double peaks at 7.7/8.6 and 11.05/11.25 , as well as the distinct rise in flux near 7.3@xmath1 m are not reproduced by torus models and show that there must be some real , although weak , pah emission on top of the continuum .",
    "the weakness of the pah emission can be understood in terms of dilution by the hot dust continuum and destruction by the intense agn radiation field .",
    "ngc1068 has a circumnuclear starburst region , and some of the pah emission might be picked up from this region by the large sws aperture .",
    "the match in shape with the ( small - aperture ) ground - based data of roche et al .",
    "( 1984 ) in the 8 - 13@xmath1 m range , and comparisons to ground - based co maps , suggest that this effect is of minor importance here .    in the circinus galaxy",
    "the 7.7/8.6 ratio is somewhere in between the two extrema m82 and ngc1068 .",
    "the feature / continuum ratio of the pah features , however , is much higher in circinus than in ngc1068 .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that in the case of circinus the large sws aperture indeed picked up parts of the well - known circumnuclear star forming region .",
    "an important diagnostic in many extragalactic studies is the depth of the silicate absorption feature at 9.7@xmath1 m and the extinction derived from it .",
    "however , the presence of strong pah bands on both sides of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate feature makes it very difficult to estimate the continuum level and the true depth of the silicate absorption .",
    "in particular ground - based 813@xmath1 m data suffer from this problem . because of their continuous wavelength coverage iso - sws01 spectra are well suited to shed more light on this question . in the following",
    "we will discuss this issue using the example of m82 .",
    "firstly , evidence against a strong 9.7@xmath1 m absorption comes from the absence of a strong 18@xmath1 m silicate absorption ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . according to draine & lee ( 1984 ) the expected ratio @xmath20(18@xmath1 m ) / @xmath20(9.7@xmath1 m ) is 0.4 .",
    "furthermore an analysis of hydrogen recombination lines in the iso range yields a moderate a@xmath21(gas)@xmath16 5 mag ( for a uniform screen model - see schreiber 1998 ) .",
    "next we come back to the comparison of the m82 spectrum to the spectrum of ngc253 ( fig .",
    "the two galaxies are similar in a@xmath21 and exhibit a very similar pah spectrum .",
    "the only distinction appears to be a stronger vsg continuum in ngc253 .",
    "a strong rise of the continuum in this range is typical for regions of intense uv flux ( e.g. dsert et al .",
    "1990 , vigroux et al .",
    "1996)./[[ne ii ] ) , but due to the compactness of the starburst in ngc253 the radiation field here is more intense than in m82 . ]",
    "the difference between both spectra can be well fit by a power - law continuum that begins to rise at approximately 89@xmath1 m .",
    "finally , we compare our spectrum of m82 to the sws01 spectrum of the galactic reflection nebula ngc 7023 .",
    "little extinction is expected in the line of sight to this nebula .",
    "the continuum under the pah bands in ngc 7023 is very weak and starts to grow only beyond 20@xmath1 m ( moutou et al .",
    "the flux density around 10@xmath1 m is almost on the same level as the flux density shortward of the 6@xmath1 m pah band and at 1520@xmath1 m .",
    "it could be explained by an underlying pah plateau , or by the wings of the 7.7/8.6 and 11.3 pah features ( which can be represented by lorentz profiles - boulanger et al .",
    "1998 , mattila et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we therefore assume that in ngc7023 this region consists mainly of emission bands , with little or no continuum and silicate absorption . in fig .",
    "4 we overplot the ( smoothed ) ngc7023 spectrum on that of m82 . the ngc7023 spectrum has been multiplied by a factor 3.25 in order to normalize the pah emission feature at 7.6@xmath1 m to the one in m82 .",
    "the 3.3 and 11.3@xmath1 m bands in m82 are weaker compared to ngc7023 .",
    "this might be explained e.g. by the harder radiation field in m82 ( joblin et al .",
    "1996 , see sect .",
    "[ s : pah_var ] ) .",
    "apart from this the two spectra are remarkably similar . only at higher wavelengths a component of hot , small dust grains starts to add to the m82 continuum , as expected due to the much harder radiation field in m82 .    in view of these arguments we constructed a toy model in order to reproduce the observed spectrum of m82 .",
    "the model simply consists of the scaled spectrum of ngc7023 plus a power - law continuum which starts at 8.5@xmath1 m ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we use a power - law rather than a black body curve for sake of simplicity .",
    "a power - law produces a very good fit to the continuum up to 20  25@xmath1 m .",
    "a black - body curve would be more problematic , because the dust may not have a single temperature , and might not be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "m82 is an extended source for the sws apertures .",
    "there is a flux jump around 12@xmath1 m by a factor of about 1.3 , corresponding to a similar change in aperture size .",
    "we hence multiplied the power law continuum by 1.3 longward of 12@xmath1 m .",
    "the free parameters - the scaling factors for the ngc7023 spectrum and the power law , plus the power law index - were adjusted by hand ; we did not pursue a formal fit .",
    "5 shows , that this simple model matches the observed spectrum remarkably well .",
    "there is no need to invoke any kind of extinction . due to the uncertainties in the spectra , however , there is room for a moderate extinction , in accordance with the results from the recombination line studies ( a@xmath21 @xmath16 5 mag ) .",
    "a slightly different power - law , modified by a modest amount of extinction , could fit the spectrum equally well .",
    "however , a strong overall extinction , as deduced from the ground based 8 - 13@xmath1 m data ( a@xmath21 = 1560 mag , gillett et al .",
    "1975 ) , is clearly incompatible with the new iso data .",
    "this is an example of the potential danger of overestimating the silicate absorption depth in baseline - limited data .",
    "many iso spectra of galactic and extragalactic objects have been taken in low resolution mode ( isophot - s , isocam - cvf ) .",
    "also , surveys with future mid- and far - infrared space missions , e.g. of galaxies at higher redshifts , will likely be performed with a relatively low resolution .",
    "for example the irs spectrometer on board sirtf will have a resolution of approximately 50100 ( plus a medium resolution mode of r=600 ) in a wavelength range similar to iso - sws . in this low resolution mode",
    "sirtf - irs , being much more sensitive than iso - sws , will be a unique tool to detect emission features in spectra of faint high - z galaxies .",
    "low resolution spectra , however , suffer from possible identification and interpretation problems caused by coincidences of atomic / ionic lines and solid state features . in our high resolution",
    "sws01 galaxy spectra lines and features are well separated , and we can use these spectra as templates to identify and highlight the importance of possible confusion problems . in fig .",
    "6 we have smoothed and rebinned the m82 and ngc1068 spectra to a resolution of 50 to simulate e.g. an isocam - cvf or a sirtf - irs spectrum .",

    "we want to mention three lines in particular : [ ar ii ] at 6.99@xmath1 m , which might be confused with the underlying pah emission ( and the nearby h@xmath2 s(5 ) line ) , [ ne ii ] at 12.8@xmath1 m , which in fact has been confused in the past with the underlying 12.7@xmath1 m pah feature , and [ ne v ] at 14.3@xmath1 m , which also has been confused in the past with the nearby pah emission . to get an indication of the relative contributions of the 12.7@xmath1 m pah flux and the [ ne ii ] line flux to the combined ( line plus feature ) flux in low resolution spectra we have measured both fluxes in our high resolution spectra .",
    "table [ tab : ne2_vs_pah ] summarizes the ratios of pah/[ne ii ] in all 5 templates .",
    "the values vary widely : in 30dor the flux is solely due to [ ne ii ] , whereas in circinus [ ne ii ] contributes only about 15% of the combined flux . for the 7.0@xmath1 m feature ,",
    "we find that the broad feature contributes 25% of the combined flux of feature , h@xmath2 , and [ ar ii ] in ngc253 . in the low resolution representation of m82 in fig .",
    "6 the shape of the 14.3@xmath1 m pah resembles very much the shape of an unresolved line like the [ ne iii ] line at 15.5@xmath1 m and can be mistaken as [ ne v ] .",
    "the high resolution spectrum of m82 ( fig .",
    "2 ) clearly shows , that there is no at 14.32@xmath1 m but an emission feature plus a weak line of 14.37@xmath1 m .",
    "of all the strong fine structure emission lines only few lines remain unambiguously detectable in low resolution spectra , like br@xmath24 , br@xmath25 , [ ne iii ] 15@xmath1 m , 18.7 , 33.5@xmath1 m , and [ si ii ] 34.8@xmath1 m in m82 , or [ o iv ] 26@xmath1 m and perhaps [ ne v ] 24@xmath1 m , and [ s iv ] 10.5@xmath1 m in ngc1068 . clearly , low resolution spectra are very well suited for pah and continuum measurements",
    ". however , flux measurements of narrow lines , and  in some cases  even their identification , can be very difficult .",
    "for these purposes higher resolutions , as for instance provided by the r=600 mode of the sirtf spectrometer , are definitely needed .",
    "we have detected a large number of mid - infrared features in galaxy spectra , some of them previously unobserved , and discussed the dependence of the dust features on ism condition in galaxies .",
    "the spectral features vary considerably from source to source in presence and relative strength .",
    "emission features are largely absent in the intense radiation field close to an agn , and weak in a low metallicity , intensely star forming environment .",
    "differences in the absorption spectra point to different physical properties of the obscuring regions in starburst and active galaxies",

    "they provide important clues for the identification and interpretation of high redshift , dusty galaxies .",

    "for instance , xu et al . (",
    "1998 ) have constructed semi - empirical galaxy seds to model the considerable pah effects on number counts and redshift distributions .",

    "the advantage of the wide wavelength coverage of the sws spectra has been used to illustrate the problem of the continuum definition and the true depth of the silicate absorption .",

    "<S> in fact the apparent depth of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption may be overestimated in the presence of uib emission , as we demonstrate by comparing the spectrum of m82 to the ( absorption free ) spectrum of the reflection nebula . </S>",
    "<S> no strong silicate absorption is present in m82 . </S>",
    "<S> the ( very small grain ) dust continuum under the uib emission in our starburst templates can be modeled by a simple power law , starting at wavelengths between 8 and 9@xmath1 m .    </S>",
    "<S> we find broad h@xmath2o - ice absorption features at 3.0@xmath1 m in m82 and ngc253 . </S>",
    "<S> their optical depths ( relative to the visual extinction ) indicate that the lines of sight towards these galaxies have similar properties as the line of sight towards the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> the active galaxy ngc1068 exhibits a clearly different spectrum of absorption features , indicating different physical conditions in the obscuring regions of this agn compared to the starburst templates .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are valuable templates for future mid - infrared missions . </S>",
    "<S> we smooth our data to simulate low resolution spectra as obtained with isocam - cvf , isophot - s , and in the future with the low resolution mode of sirtf - irs , and use our high spectral resolution information to highlight possible identification problems at low resolving power that are caused by coincidences of lines and features . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are available in electronic form from the authors . </S>"
