    "_ fluid mechanics _ is a field theory of newtonian mechanics that has galilean symmetry : that is to say , it is covariant under transformations of the galilei group .",
    "two symmetries ( _ i.e. _   transformation invariances ) are known as subgroups of the galilei group : translation ( space and time ) and space - rotation . in the present formulation of flows of an ideal fluid , we seek a scenario which has a formal equivalence with the gauge theory in physics .",
    "the gauge theory provides a basis for reflection on the similarity between fluid mechanics and other physical fields .",
    "the gauge principle requires a physical system under investigation to have a _ symmetry _ , _",
    "i.e. _  a gauge invariance ( an invariance with respect to a certain group of transformations ) . following this principle , an attempt has been made in kambe ( 2007 ) to study a gauge symmetry of flow fields with respect to translational transformations .",
    "the formulation started from a galilei - invariant lagrangian of a system of _ point masses _ which is known to have _ global _ gauge symmetries with respect to both translation and rotation . and",
    "appendix for the definition of global gauge symmetry ( _ i.e. _  global gauge invariance ) and local gauge symmetry .",
    "] it was then extended to flows of a fluid , a _ continuous _",
    "material characterized with mass density and entropy density . in addition to the global symmetry , _ local _ gauge invariance of a lagrangian is required for such a continuous field .",
    "thus , the convective derivative of fluid mechanics ( _ i.e. _  the lagrange derivative ) is identified as a _",
    "covariant derivative _ , which is a building block in the framework of gauge theory . based on this",
    ", appropriate lagrangian functionals are defined for motion of an ideal fluid .",
    "euler s equation of motion is derived from the action principle .",
    "it is found that a general solution of this formulation is equivalent to the classical clebsch solution ( clebsch 1859 ; lamb 1932 ) , in which the vorticity has a particular form and the helicity vanishes .    in most traditional formulations , the continuity equation and isentropic condition",
    "are taken into account as constraints for the variations of the action principle by using lagrange multipliers , where the _ isentropy _ means that each fluid particle of an ideal fluid keeps its entropy value along its trajectory ( but the fluid is not necessarily _",
    "homentropic_. ) in the present formulation however , those equations are derived from the action principle .",
    "the total lagrangian density consists of kinetic energy and internal energy ( with negative sign ) , supplemented with additional two terms associated with translation invariances of mass and entropy ( see ( 27 ) of  3.1 ) .",
    "as is interpreted in detail in  4.1 , it is remarkable that the lagrangians associated with the latter two terms are given such forms as can be eliminated from the action represented with the particle coordinate @xmath1 ( _ i.e. _  lagrangian coordinate ) , so that the euler - lagrange equations represented by the independent varibales @xmath3 are uninfluenced by the additional terms .",
    "such a form of lagrangian has close analogy to the chern - simons term in the gauge theory .",
    "earlier papers ( kambe , 2003a , b ) investigated the rotation symmetry of the velocity field @xmath4 in a preliminary way , and found that the vorticity @xmath5 is in fact a gauge field associated with the rotation symmetry .",
    "however in the previous studies including kambe ( 2007 ) , the vorticity and helicity were not taken into account in satisfactory manner .",
    "present formulation tries to account for the vorticity and helicity more properly and comprehensively .",
    "thus , the main theme of the present paper is the rotation symmetry .    a new structure of the rotation symmetry",
    "is given in  6 ( after a review of the rotational transformations in  5 ) by the following lagrangian @xmath0 : @xmath6 \\,\\rangle \\,{\\mbox{\\textrm{d}}}^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$}},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a vector potential and @xmath8 \\equiv { \\partial}_t { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$}}+({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}\\cdot\\nabla){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$}}-({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$}}\\cdot\\nabla){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}+ ( \\nabla\\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$ } } ) { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$}}$ ] .",
    "this is derived from a lagrangian form characteristic of a _ topological _ term known in the gauge theory .",
    "this new term yields non - vanishing rotational component of the velocity field , and provides a source term of non - vanishing helicity .",
    "this is also the chern - simons term , describing non - trivial topology of vorticity field , _ i.e. _  mutual linking of vorticity lines .",
    "the vorticity equation is derived as an equation for the gauge field .",
    "these are described in  [ s6 ] ( lagrangian @xmath9 associated with rotation symmetry ) ,  [ s7 ] ( corrections to the variation ) , and  [ s8 ] ( significance of @xmath0 ) .    with regard to the variational formulation of fluid flows , the works of eckart ( 1938 , 1960 ) and herivel ( 1955 ) are among the earliest to have influenced current formulations .",
    "their variations are carried out in two ways : _",
    "i.e. _  a lagrangian approach and an eulerian approach . in both approaches , the equation of continuity and the condition of is entropy are added as constraint conditions on the variations by means of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the lagrangian approach is also taken by soper ( 1976 ) . in this relativistic formulation those equation are derived from the equations of current conservation .",
    "several action principles to describe relativistic fluid dynamics have appeared in the past ( see soper ( 1976 , ",
    "4.2 ) for some list of them ) , not only that of taub ( 1954 ) .",
    "firstly , in the lagrangian approach , the euler - lagrange equation results in an equation equivalent to euler s equation of motion in which the acceleration term is represented as the second time derivative of position coordinates of the lagrangian representation . in this formulation",
    ", however , there is a certain degree of freedom in the relation between the lagrangian particle coordinates @xmath10 and eulerian space coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "namely , the relation between them is determined only up to an unknown rotation .",
    "this point has not been considered seriously in the past , although it is fundamental for the formualtion of flows .",
    "this will be discussed more precisely in the sections 4.2 and 8.2 .",
    "a common feature of herivel ( 1955 ) and eckart ( 1960 ) is that both arrive at the clebsch solution in the eulerian representaion ( see sec.[a1-gi ] and [ 3b ] ) .",
    "however , it was remarked by bretherton ( 1970 ) that the clebsch representation has only local validity in the neighbourhood of a chosen point if vortex lines are knotted or linked .    in the second approach , referred to as the _ eulerian _ description , the action principle of an ideal fluid results only in potential flows if the fluid is homentropic , as shown in kambe ( 2003a , 2007 ) .",
    "however it is well - known that , even in such a homentropic fluid , it should be possible to have rotational flows .",
    "this is a long - standing problem ( serrin 1959 ; lin 1963 ; seliger & whitham 1968 ; bretherton 1970 ; salmon 1988 ) .",
    "lin ( 1963 ) tried to resolve this difficulty by introducing a _ constraint _ as a side condition , imposing invariance of lagrangian particle labels @xmath10 along particle trajectories .",
    "the constraints for the variation are defined by using lagrange multipliers ( functions of positions ) , which are called potentials. in addition , the continuity equation and isentropic condition are also taken into account by using lagrange multipliers . however , the physical significance of those potentials introduced as the lagrange multipliers is not clear .",
    "mysteriously , the lagrange multiplier for the continuity equation becomes the velocity potential for the irrotational part of the velocity .",
    "gauge theory for fluid flows provides a crucial key to resolve these issues , which is the main target of the present investigation .",
    "symmetries imply conservation laws . according to the relativistic formulation ( _ e.g._soper 1976 ; landau & lifshitz 1987 ( ch.xv ) ) , as long as the flow fields obey the euler - lagrange equation , an energy - momentum tensor @xmath12 must obey the conservation equation of the form @xmath13 ( considered in sec .  [ 4b ] below ) . the energy - momentum tensor @xmath12 in the present case is given in sec.[4-flv ] .",
    "a similar field - theoretic approach is taken in jackiw ( 2002 ) by applying the ideas of particle physics to fluid mechanics in terms of hamiltonian and poisson brackets , both relativistically and nonrelativistically , and extension to supersymmetry is also considered .",
    "in soper ( 1976 ) and jackiw ( 2002 ) , the nonrelativistic part follows the traditional approach and no explicit gauge - theoretic consideration is given to fluid mechanics in the sense of the present formulation .",
    "the appendix describes the background of the present theory : ( a ) known gauge invariances in two systems of electromagnetism and clebsch form of fluid flows , ( b ) related aspects in quantum mechanics and relativistic theory , and ( c ) brief scenario of gauge principle .",
    "the formulation of kambe ( 2007 ) started from a galilei - invariant lagrangian of a system of _ point masses _ , which is known to have _ global _ gauge symmetries with respect to both translation and rotation .",

    "the discrete positions of point masses are replaced by continuous parameters @xmath14 of particles in a bounded sub - space @xmath15 ( of consideration ) in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath16 .",
    "the spatial position of each mass particle labelled by @xmath1 ( lagrange parameter ) is denoted by @xmath17 , a function of @xmath1 as well as the time @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath42 for arbitrary constants @xmath43 ( @xmath30 ) , requires that the total momentum defined by @xmath44 must be invariant . in the local transformation",
    ", however , the variation field @xmath43 depends on the time @xmath18 and space point @xmath26 , and the variation @xmath45 does not vanish in general .",
    "according to the gauge principle of appendix [ a3-gp ] , non - vanishing of @xmath46 is understood as meaning that a _ new field _",
    "@xmath47 must be taken into account in order to achieve _ local gauge invariance _ of the lagrangian @xmath48 . to that end",
    ", we try to replace the partial time derivative @xmath49 by a _",

    "the lagrangian @xmath57 defined by ( [ lfvv ] ) for a continuous field has such global symmetries , inherited from the discrete system .",
    "it is a primary concern here to investigate whether the system of fluid flows satisfies local invariance .",
