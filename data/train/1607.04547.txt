    "the shallow water equations ( saint - venant @xcite ) are a common @xmath3 approximation to the @xmath4dimensional navier - stokes equations to model incompressible , free surface flows . due to the ability of high - order galerkin methods to keep dissipation and dispersion errors low ( ainsworth et al .",
    "@xcite ) and their flexibility with arbitrary geometries and _ hp_-adaptivity , these methods are proving their mettle for solving the shallow water equations ( sw ) in the modeling of non - linear waves in different geophysical flows ( ma @xcite , iskandarani @xcite , taylor et al .",

    "although it is typically assumed that high - order galerkin methods are not strictly necessary , they do offer many advantages over their low - order counterparts .",

    "high - order methods are often attributed with some disadvantages as well .",
    "for example , they are constrained by small time - steps . to overcome this restriction , we follow krn et al .",
    "@xcite and implement an implicit runge - kutta scheme based on giraldo et al .",
    "furthermore , the numerical approximation of non - linear hyperbolic systems via high - order methods is susceptible to unphysical gibbs oscillations that form in the proximity of strong gradients such as those of sharp wave fronts ( e.g. bores ) .",
    "filters such as vandeven s and boyd s @xcite are the most common tools to handle this problem , as well as artificial diffusion of some sort .",
    "however , we noticed that filtering may not be sufficient as the flow strengthens and the wave sharpness intensifies .",
    "we have recently shown this issue with the solution of the non - linear burgers equation by high order spectral elements in @xcite and will show how a proper dynamic viscosity does indeed improve on filters for the shallow water system as well . to preserve numerical stability without compromising the overall quality of the solution , pham van et al .",
    "@xcite and rakowsky et al .",
    "@xcite utilized a lilly - smagorinsky model @xcite . to account for sub - grid scale effects",
    ", viscosity was also utilized in the dg model described by gourgue et al .",
    "@xcite to improve their inviscid simulations .",
    "recently , pasquetti et al .",
    "@xcite stabilized the high - order spectral element solution of the one - dimensional saint - venant equations via the entropy viscosity method .",
    "michoski et al .",
    "@xcite compared artificial viscosity , limiters , and filters for the ( modal ) dg solution of sw , concluding that a dynamically adaptive diffusion may be the most effective means of regularization at higher orders .",
    "the diffusion model that we present in this work stems from the sub - grid scale ( sgs ) model that was proposed by nazarov and hoffman @xcite to stabilize the linear finite element solution of compressible flows with shock waves .",
    "this was later applied to stabilize high - order continuous and discontinuous galerkin ( cg / dg ) in the context of stratified , low mach number atmospheric flows by marras et al .  in @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the ideas of scales splitting in large eddy simulation , where the scales of physical importance are split into grid resolvable and unresolvable .",
    "the unresolved scales are then parameterized via the sgs model at hand ( _ dyn - sgs _ ) . _",
    "dyn - sgs _ is applicable to any numerical method and is not limited to galerkin approximations ; its implementation in existing numerical models is straightforward .",
    "stabilization becomes more important as the grid resolution is decreased .",
    "the metric that we utilize to evaluate its importance is the spectrum of kinetic energy across wave numbers . to understand the impact of diffusion with respect to the energetic behavior of the numerical solution",
    ", we compare the spectra obtained for the stabilized continuous and discontinuous galerkin solutions against their inviscid counterparts . as viscosity",
    "is accounted for , the solution improves at coarser resolutions for both cg and dg . in the case of dg",
    ", however , dissipation is already built - in by the flux computation across elements .",
    "for this reason , the amount of artificial diffusion that dg requires for stabilization is smaller than the one required by cg .",
    "this property of dg has been exploited to build implicit large eddy simulation ( iles ) models ( e.g. , uranga et al .",
    "iles relies on the numerical dissipation of the discretization method to model the effects on the unresolved , sub - grid scale eddies rather than using an explicit sub - grid scale ( sgs ) model , under the requirement of high - resolution @xcite .",
    "the mpdata method of smolarkiewicz @xcite is an example of such an iles model used for modeling geophysical flows .",
    "finally , there is a known difficulty in including wetting and drying algorithms ( typically designed for low - order methods ) while preserving high - order accuracy .",
    "the application of wetting / drying with discontinuous galerkin using low - order lagrange polynomials can be found in , e.g. , bunya et al .",

    "the positivity preserving limiter of xing et al .",
    "@xcite ( xing - zhang - shu limiter from now on ) was designed for high - order discontinuous galerkin to solve this problem in particular .",
    "because it is mass conservative and preserves the global high order accuracy of the solution , we implemented it in our model and extended it to continuous galerkin as well .",
    "this limiter is guaranteed to work if and only if the mean water height is positive .",
    "its designers recommend using the total variation bounding ( tvb ) limiter of shu @xcite to make the solution positive definite .",
    "because the tvb limiter requires a bound on the derivative of the solution , which we do not know a priori , we rely on the artificial dissipation introduced above instead .",
    "looking at the larger picture of things , the ever increasing interest in the high - order accuracy of inundation models stems from a long list of coastal disasters in the last 10 years alone . from the 2004 tsunami in the indian ocean that caused 280,000 deaths , to the 2011 tohoku tsunami , followed by superstorm sandy in 2012 , the devastating 2013 typhoons in the philippines and india , and the 2014 hurricane odile ; the list seems to be getting longer rapidly as the global climate patterns are changing . to study the impact of similar events in the future ,",

    "nonetheless , we introduce some notation that we are going to use later in the paper . to solve the shallow water equations by element - based galerkin methods on a domain @xmath23",
    ", we proceed by defining the weak form of ( [ swe ] ) that we first recast in compact notation as    @xmath24    where @xmath25^{\\rm t}$ ] is the transposed array of the solution variables and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the flux and source terms . in the case of spectral elements ,",

    "the problem at hand is solved only locally , and unlike the case of spectral elements , the flux integral that stems from the integration by - parts must be discretized as well .",
    "the element - wise counterpart of the matrix problem ( [ matrixprobcg ] ) is then written as : @xmath36 where we obtain @xmath37 from the element boundary matrix , @xmath38 , and the element mass matrix , @xmath32 . out of various possible choices for the definition of the numerical flux @xmath39 in eq .",

    "this scheme has desirable accuracy and stability properties : @xmath0 all stages are second order accurate , @xmath1 it is stiffly accurate and @xmath42-stable , and @xmath2 it is strong - stability - preserving ( ssp ) @xcite with ssp coefficient of 2 .",
    "these properties allow us to take large time - steps with high accuracy as well as alleviate the instability issues associated with sharp solution gradients @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional tests presented later in this paper showed to be the most demanding in terms of stability constraints .",
    "method allows us to gain up to one order of magnitude in terms of maximum admissible advective cfl when compared to an explicit method ( explicit part of ark3 , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the explicit four - stage runge - kutta solution of the solitary wave against one isolated obstacle described in  [ oneislandtest ] preserved stability for up to cfl=0.21 using both cg and dg approximations .",
    "although we were not able to use arbitrarily large time - steps with the esdirk with the current implementation ( we will address this issue in a future work ) , we resolved the same problem at cfl = 1.8 .",

    "computationally , at each of the two implicit stages we have to solve a nonlinear equation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are the stage values , @xmath47 .",

    "we approximate the jacobian using directional finite differences and iterate with the generalized minimal residual ( gmres ) method , which is effectively a jacobian - free newton ",
    "krylov method @xcite .",
    "the gmres stopping criterion is also based on the relative residual .",
    "the first stage is explicit and equal to the last stage of the previous step , effectively making it a two - stage method , which saves some computational time .",
    "there are different ways to derive the viscous model described by eq .",
    "( [ swe ] ) from the inviscid saint - venant equations .",
    "analogous to our previous work on the large eddy simulation of stratified atmospheric flows @xcite , the current model builds on the separation between grid resolved ( indicated as @xmath53 for any quantity @xmath54 ) and unresolved ( sub - grid ) scales .",
    "the unresolved scales are modeled via the eddy viscosity scheme described in this paper . given an element @xmath55 of order @xmath56 and with side lengths @xmath57 of comparable orders of magnitude , we define the following characteristic length ( and hence filter width @xcite ) : @xmath58 the value of @xmath59 sets the size of the smallest resolvable scales in the same way as cut - off filters do in large eddy simulation models .    the application of this filter to the continuity equation ( [ masseqn ] ) results in the presence of an additional sub - grid term on the right - hand side .",
    "it is often debated whether diffusion should be applied to the continuity equation @xcite ; clearly , should the discrete viscous operator not be conservative , mass dissipation should not be used .",
    "however , by relying on spectral elements with integration by parts of the second - order diffusion operator , the discrete viscous operator is conservative , as shown in @xcite . to get a sense of how necessary a stabilized continuity equation may be",
    ", we will show a few results for both conditions in  [ oneislandtest ] .",
