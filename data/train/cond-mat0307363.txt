    "in pattern forming systems quite often situations occur where patches of different bulk phases get separated by fronts or interfaces . in such cases , the relevant dynamics of the system",

    "when the interface separates two thermodynamically stable phases , as in crystal - melt interfacial growth problems , the width of the interfacial zone is usually of atomic dimensions . for such systems ,",
    "one often has to resort to a moving boundary description , in which the boundary conditions at the interface are determined phenomenologically or by microscopic considerations .",
    "a question that naturally arises for such interfaces is the influence of stochastic fluctuations on the motion and scaling properties of such interfaces .     and",

    "the perturbation around the unstable state at the leading edge ahead of the front grows linearly and spreads with speed @xmath2 , thereby pulling the rest of the front along with it at @xmath3 ( hence the nomenclature ) . for pushed fronts ,",
    "it is the bulk phase that drives the front propagation mechanism , as if the bulk phase ( whose description requires nonlinear terms in the equation describing the front ) pushes the leading edge from behind to achieve a front speed @xmath4 . ]    at the other extreme is a class of fronts that arise in pattern forming systems , where the occurrence of fronts or transition zones is _ fundamentally related to their inherent nonequilibrium nature _ , as they do not connect two thermodynamic equilibrium phases that are separated by a first order phase transition . in such cases",
    " for example , chemical fronts @xcite , the temperature and density transition zones in thermal plumes @xcite , the domain walls separating domains of different orientations in rotating rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite , streamer fronts in discharges @xcite , or the aggregate fronts in diffusion limited aggregation @xcite  the fronts are relatively wide and are therefore described by the same continuum equations that describe nonequilibrium bulk patterns .",
    "the lore in nonequilibrium pattern formation is that when the relevant length scales are large , ( thermal ) fluctuation effects are relatively small @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in the first approximation , the dynamics of many pattern forming systems can be understood in terms of the deterministic dynamics of the basic patterns and coherent structures .",
    "the first questions to study for them are properties like the existence and the asymptotic speed of propagation of the front solutions in deterministic equations .",
    "for example , in one dimension , the existence of an asymptotic propagation speed @xmath5 for deterministic fronts means that in the comoving co - ordinate @xmath6 , moving w.r.t . to the laboratory co - ordinate @xmath7 at a speed @xmath5 ,",
    "the front profile approaches a fixed shape as @xmath8 .",

    "these equations are partial differential equations .",
    "instances of such fronts , where fluctuation effects are small ( and therefore they can be neglected in favour of a deterministic description ) are abundant in physics @xcite , chemistry @xcite and biology @xcite . ] as a result of detailed studies carried out in the last decade , it has emerged that in these systems , the dynamics is described by _ propagation of ( deterministic ) fronts into unstable states _ , i.e. , the state of the system in the region far ahead of the front is _ linearly unstable _",
    "these studies have classified deterministic fronts propagating into unstable states in two categories in a broad sense : the so - called _ pulled _ and _ pushed _ fronts ( see fig .",

    "if the state is not linearly unstable , then @xmath2 is trivially zero , and in addition , there can also be fronts propagating into unstable states with @xmath11 ; in such cases front propagation is always dominated by the nonlinear growth in the front region itself , and hence fronts in these cases are in a sense pushed too .",
    "comes out naturally for fronts propagating into unstable states and there onwards when one can expect a pulled front ( possibly a further subclassification of coherent or incoherent pulled fronts ) or a pushed front is a fairly involved subject in itself . for a proper analysis of it ,",

    "the understanding that the fluctuations are indeed important was not only motivated by the realization that matter is composed of discrete particles , but also from the fact that there are situations , where fronts are naturally made of discrete constituents on a lattice ( see for example , refs .",

    "the presence of fluctuations , be it as a result of discreteness of particles and the lattice , or be it as a result of the externally noise terms to otherwise deterministic equations , immediately implies that ( i ) at a contrast to the deterministic fronts propagating with a fixed shape at a fixed speed @xmath5 at @xmath8 , strictly speaking , different snapshots of one particular realization of a fluctuating front , taken at different times , will be microscopically different from each other ; although in an average sense , each of these realizations will have the _ same _ well - defined shape .",
    "the consequences of this is the following : unlike the deterministic fronts , the front position defined by the location @xmath56 of the point , where the number of particles per correlation volume is a fixed number , say @xmath57 ( or by the point where the front field reaches a fixed value @xmath58 ) , does not move with a constant speed for a given realization of a fluctuating front _ even for large times_. it is only when the movement of this point over a long period of time is considered ( at large times ) , the speed of this point , calculated as a long time average , can then be defined as the asymptotic front speed .

    "as one can expect , the front obtained by such an averaging process is much wider than any of the seven realizations , since such an averaging fails to filter out the effect of front wandering  in future , we will refer to this averaging process as `` simple averaging '' .",
    "the above discussion , therefore , points us to the following conclusions : ( a ) to obtain the average asymptotic shape of fluctuating fronts , one has to separate out the wandering effects , i.e. , one has to first realign the simultaneous realizations and then calculate the average shape  from now on , we will refer to such an averaging as `` conditional ( ensemble ) averaging , '' . to find out how to align different snapshots of fluctuating fronts in the sense of ( a ) above ,",

    "in addition , ( c ) a comprehensive description of fluctuating fronts must not only include the expression of the asymptotic front speed and as well as its approach in time towards a steady ( conditionally averaged ) front shape starting from an initial configuration , but also must it identify the nature of its wandering ( i.e. , whether it is diffusive , sub- or super - diffusive ) , along with the relevant characterizing exponents . ] _ such a comprehensive description for fluctuating fronts propagating into unstable states is the central theme of this review article . in one spatial dimension , our convention will be to consider fronts propagating from the left to the right , and keeping in line with the propagation direction of the front , we will often use forward for rightward and backward for leftward interchangeably_.    although i claim to provide a comprehensive description for fluctuating fronts in this review article , its precise meaning has to be properly laid out at this point  after all , a front is nothing but an interface that demarcates the boundary between two different phases within a system ; and the properties of such interfaces for , e.g. , fluid flows in porous media , flame fronts in a burning paper , atom deposition processes in molecular beam epitaxy experiments , aggregate fronts in diffusion - limited - aggregation etc .",

    "[ sec1.2 ] , two major approaches have been used to this end  the first one being that of noisy dynamical equations , where one simply adds external noise terms to the otherwise deterministic equations to introduce fluctuations . in the second approach ,",
    "many researchers in the last few years have taken the route of studying fluctuating fronts that are constituted of discrete particles on a lattice , where stochasticity of the microscopic dynamics of the particles themselves gives rise to fluctuations . in a way",
    ", the philosophy of both these approaches is to first have a deterministic front as the underlying structure , and then to study the effect of fluctuations superimposed thereupon : there exists a parameter in these approaches that controls the fluctuation strength .",
    "for example , in the second approach , this parameter is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the conditionally averaged number of particles per lattice site in the stable phase of the front , and the deterministic mean - field results are obtained when @xmath69 . in the recent past , there has also appeared a new approach ( along the lines of quite the opposite philosophy of the two approaches discussed above ) to extract the mean - field behaviour at small @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "therein , one defines a variable @xmath70 that measures the number of particles per correlation volume in the stable phase of the front , and depending on the system parameters , one can have @xmath71 for correlation volume @xmath72 and small @xmath68 ; in this limit , one also recovers the deterministic mean - field description for the front .",
    "nonetheless , it has to be noted that the majority of the studies on fluctuating fronts have been carried out on fluctuating `` pulled '' for more details.[fn13 ] ] fronts , i.e. , on fronts whose deterministic limit yield pulled fronts , as opposed to on fluctuating pushed fronts , what we mean by fluctuating pushed fronts is that the deterministic limit of these fronts yield pushed fronts.[fn14 ] ] .",
    "this is not very surprising  first of all , for the deterministic counterparts , it is the pulled fronts , for which there is a solid theoretical understanding . secondly ( and more importantly ) , it is the sensitivity of the pulled fronts to the dynamics of the leading edge , which is severely affected by the discreteness of particles and the lattice , or by the presence of external noise terms  as a result , fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts exhibit many surprising characteristics .",

    "it therefore should not come as a surprise that ( unlike what we experienced in the field - theory of fluctuating fronts for external fluctuations ) describing the effect of internal fluctuations on propagating fronts is a real challenge for the field - theorists .",
    "before we plunge into the details in sec .",
    "[ sec4.1 ] onwards , let us demonstrate the major intricacies .    to start with , let us remind ourselves that all the works on the field - theoretical treatments of the effects of internal fluctuations on propagating fronts that i am aware of have been exclusively in the reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "however , as far as sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] is concerned , the readers must not overconclude the reference to reaction - diffusion systems in the context of field - theory for the effects of internal fluctuations on fronts in general . to make this point clearer ,",
    "i want to draw the reader s attention to the fact that there exists a vast literature on field - theoretical treatments of the effect of internal fluctuations on fronts in various reaction - diffusion systems , where two opposing currents of reactant species of particles meet from two sides and reactions between them take place in a reasonably localized volume of space known as the reaction zone . in the reaction zone , one can model the fluctuations in particle densities by means of a field - theory , and one obtains various kinds of spatiotemporal behaviour of particle densities or correlations between reacting particles etc ( see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in these systems",
    "reaction fronts do develop , but they do not propagate ( asymptotically ) with a constant speed .",
    "the dynamics of these fronts are extremely interesting on their own merit , and their understanding has contributed significantly to renormalization group techniques , but as far as this review article is concerned , they are beyond our purview .",
    "on the other hand , as far as internal fluctuations in propagating fronts are concerned , langevin type field - theories of reaction - diffusion fronts were of interest first to chemists @xcite and mathematicians @xcite . to be more particular , the interest was in a langevin description of stochastic fisher equation .",
    "it would still be another few years until physicists found field - theories for propagating fronts to be of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "so why are field - theories of internal fluctuations in propagating fronts so difficult ?",
    "the answer to this question , in fact , lies at two levels .",
    "the difficulty at the first level stems from the complication associated with the description of fluctuations in a real experimental situation . in the second paragraph of sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we discussed this briefly using the example of a chemical reaction  that in general , in a chemical reaction , not only are there local fluctuations in the density of reactants , but also complicated correlations between fluctuation in particle densities and in the mesoscopic parameters such as reaction rate or diffusion coefficient of particles exist . taking all these into account in a reasonable and satisfactory degree of detail is indeed very difficult , and other than ref .",
    "@xcite in the chemistry literature , i am not aware of any treatment where the effect of local fluctuations in the mesoscopic reaction - diffusion parameters on the propagating front has been considered .    to get a good theoretical grip on reaction - diffusion processes ,",
    "just like we have seen all along in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , in all the field - theoretical approaches based on langevin type stochastic differential equations , it is customary to consider fluctuations only in the density of particles while the usual mesoscopic parameters such as diffusion coefficients or reaction rates are held constant .",
    "even then , these field theories are not free from intricacies .",
    "a glance at the results ( a)-(c ) below in the chemistry literature @xcite will make this clear :    \\(a ) for the reaction - diffusion process x@xmath141y@xmath142x described by the fisher equation ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath291 , where the langevin forces have been obtained from the master equation , a front speed _ higher _ than @xmath2 has been observed in ref .",
    "it appears from the results of the numerical simulation that in the range @xmath856-@xmath857 , @xmath73 behaves as @xmath858 .",
    "\\(b ) in a ginzburg - landau or schlgl model ( [ e63 ] ) , a similar langevin formalism deduced from the master equation also yields a front speed _ higher _ than @xmath44 @xcite",

    "[ sec2 ] , it is difficult to reconcile ( a ) and ( b ) with anything else [ even with ( c ) , which in itself is not the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath73 for @xmath69 ] ; and this is precisely where the second level of difficulty comes in .",
    "the point is that the langevin type field - theories derived from the master equation effectively are expansions over the `` small parameter '' @xmath863 , where @xmath65 is the conditionally averaged number of particles on lattice site @xmath66 ( see for example chap .",
    "vii of ref .",
    "@xcite , or ref .",
    "clearly , the @xmath863 expansion is only possible if @xmath864 are large quantities  so while the expansion is valid in the bulk phase of the front , it break down at the tip of the front , where there are a very few particles per lattice site . at least for a fluctuating",
    "`` pulled '' front such as the stochastic fisher equation , we already know that its properties are tremendously sensitive to the fluctuation dynamics at the tip of the front .",
    "for this reason alone , such langevin type field theories has to be applied with extreme caution , as we illustrate in the next two paragraphs below .    for fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts ,",
    "the reason why the results from the chemists side @xcite contradict the @xmath80 convergence of the front speed @xmath73 to @xmath2 from below is not difficult to trace  it lies in the fact that the form of the stochastic terms that they consider amounts to an _ additive noise _ to the deterministic equation .",
    "if we compare the resulting evolution equation of the front with the microscopic reaction - diffusion process x@xmath135x for example , the contrast between the physical implications of the stochastic differential equation and what actually happens in the microscopic process becomes really clear . in this microscopic process , lattice sites on which there is",
    "no particle to start with can not grow a particle on its own , meaning that the first particle on any lattice site has to diffuse from one of its nearest neighbours .",
    "when this idea is applied to the lattice sites that lie ahead of the front , one immediately recovers the idea of the i.f.o.l.s .",
    "( see footnote [ ifols ] ) .",
    "the lattice sites on the right of the i.f.o.l.s . can not generate particles on their own , and that was the motivation of brunet and derrida behind using a growth cutoff for @xmath865 .",
    "the growth cutoff then predicted that the leading edge of the front would be of finite extent , and it also gave rise to the @xmath80 convergence of the front speed @xmath73 to @xmath2 from below for fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts .",
    "an additive noise term totally changes this scenario . in that case , _ any place ahead of the actual front region _ where @xmath9 value is identically zero at a given time can generate a non - zero @xmath9 within an infinitesimal time interval simply due to fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations then have the capability of pulling the rest of the front faster than even the leading edge of the deterministic pulled fronts !",
    "it is therefore no wonder that these models @xcite do yield front speeds that are _ higher _ than @xmath2 .      from the discussions in the last few paragraphs above ,",
    "it is clear that as far as a stochastic differential ( fisher - type ) equation is concerned , additive noise to model fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts is out of the question .",
    "the noise value has to be zero where the @xmath9 value is zero and this requirement then points the finger to multiplicative noise .    while this argument is generally valid , question remains regarding",
    "what form of multiplicative noise one should choose .",
    "clearly , one should certainly avoid a noise term that behaves @xmath866 for @xmath846  for example the case of fluctuating pulled fronts with multiplicative noise as we encountered in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . for such noise terms , no matter howsoever small @xmath9 is , the noise amplitude is always an order of @xmath721 weaker than @xmath9 , and one does not expect such noise terms to yield a leading edge of a finite extent for the front ( although i have not seen any work proving or disproving it ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that for the front in fisher - type ( reaction - diffusion ) equation , the most frequently used noise term that does yield a leading edge of a finite extent in fact behaves @xmath867 for @xmath846 ( of this , the @xmath721 and @xmath868 limits are respectively referred to as the _ weak noise and the strong noise limits _ ) .",
    "the corresponding stochastic differential equation is then known as the stochastic fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscunov , or in short , the sfkpp equation @xcite : @xmath869 here @xmath686 satisfies the properties that @xmath870 and @xmath871 .",
    "the stochastic term is interpreted in the it sense .",

    "[ sec3 ] .    for the microscopic reaction - diffusion process x@xmath135x",
    "however , the sfkpp equation ( [ ee96 ] ) has been derived in terms of a path integral formalism @xcite , which avoids the subtleties associated with very few particles per lattice site at the leading edge of the front . in this derivation ,",
    "one first rewrites the full master equation in a path integral form , and then proceeds with the idea that the fluctuations in the front around the mean front shape are always small and retains the effects of the fluctuations only at the leading order . the compact support property for sfkpp equation  not only that there exists an @xmath873 for which @xmath874=0 $ ] , but also there exists an @xmath875 for which @xmath876=1 $ ] , and that @xmath877<\\infty\\,\\,\\forall t$ ]",

    "( [ add1 ] ) , thus , simply breaks down for fluctuating pulled fronts with multiplicative noise .",
    "+ nevertheless , since @xmath597 has been measured operationally via the centre of mass in ref .",
    "@xcite , it makes sense to use @xmath77 to calculate @xmath597 as well . with the introduction of the upper cutoff @xmath824 , which makes the @xmath967 s finite",
    ", one can very easily show [ having @xmath754 replaced by @xmath755 ] that @xmath1020 for @xmath826 .",
    "interestingly enough , in this example , one gets away with the usage of @xmath720 to obtain the theoretical curve ( dashed line ) for @xmath597 in fig .",
    "[ wim2 ]  both @xmath77 and @xmath720 scales as @xmath1021 for @xmath826 , and for fig .",
    "[ wim2 ] that is all that matters . * \\3 . fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts , such as the sfkpp equation : although we have discussed this at length in sec .",
    "[ sec4.2.2 ] , it is still useful to articulately point out a few distinct subtleties .",
    "first , if the noise term in eq .",
    "( [ ee96 ] ) is made additive by replacing @xmath9 by @xmath64 , where @xmath64 is brunet and derrida s cutoff solution ( [ e11 ] ) , @xmath77 scales as @xmath67 [ c.f .",
    "( [ add1 ] ) ] for @xmath69 , as opposed to @xmath78 .",
    "it is therefore important to take notice of this subtlety for simulation purposes  brunet and derrida properly take this into account in their own simulations @xcite . for @xmath720 however , it does not matter whether one uses @xmath9 or @xmath64 for the noise term in eq .",
    "( [ ee96 ] ) [ this is quite obvious from the expressions of @xmath720 in eqs .",
    "( [ e107 ] ) and ( [ add1 ] ) ] , one always gets @xmath939 for @xmath69 . + secondly , since @xmath720 is the short - time ( or the instantaneous ) diffusion coefficient of the front , if the diffusive spread @xmath1022 in the front positions measured through the goldstone modes are plotted as a function of time for an ensemble of fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts , one would see that @xmath1023 right from the very start . on the other hand , when the front positions are tracked by the positions of their centres of mass",
    ", one expects @xmath1024 to be smaller for small @xmath298 , but it should nevertheless converge to @xmath78 for @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , one can further argue that @xmath1025 . in order to do so",
    ", one simply has to observe that the @xmath78 scaling of @xmath77 is obtained from @xmath107 number of modes , each of which contribute an amount of @xmath1026 to @xmath77 [ c.f .",
    "( [ e115 ] ) ] . the shortest and the longest surviving modes have lifetimes respectively of @xmath1016 and @xmath1027 .",
    "thus , @xmath1028 captures only the contribution of the shortest surviving modes and should behave as @xmath1029 , while in order to observe the true @xmath78 scaling of @xmath77 , one has to wait till @xmath1027 time for the contributions of all the @xmath107 number of modes to @xmath77 to add up together .",
    "i finally end sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] ( and this review article too ) with the comment that further simulations and research are necessary to confirm the conjectures made in sec .",
    "[ sec4.3 ] .",
    "this review article has been written from my own perspective , and it is clearly reflected by the organization of the topics that i have covered . after a brief introduction to the subject , i spent a longish section on the discrete particle and lattice models of fluctuating fronts .",
    "needless to say , there is no unifying underlying structure for the plethora of results in that section  each problem or topic has been dealt with a different approach in the existing literature .",
    "the two sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] i spent on field - theory  therein , we find an organized theoretical backbone for studying the effects of fluctuations on propagating fronts by means of stochastic differential equations . finally at the end , i tried to merge the predictions of field - theories on internal fluctuations and the corresponding results for the discrete particle and lattice models .    unless existing derivations are too involved or too complex , i have tried to outline the main line of procedure .",
    "the only exception has been the issues of front diffusion in one spatial dimension , specially for the fluctuating `` pulled '' fronts , where i have delved deep in the dirty world of algebra .",
    "this was done with keeping in mind that front diffusion in one spatial dimension is a relatively new topic . in any case , i have also thrived to put in physical insights wherever appropriate . at various places ,",
    "open issues have been spelled out for further investigations as well . as for myself",
    ", it would be gratifying to see if the expert researchers , and as well as the beginners in this field , both of whom are the target readers , find this review article useful .",
