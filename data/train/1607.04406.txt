    "<S> we present a microelectromechanical system , in which a silicon beam is attached to a comb - drive actuator , that is used to tune the tension in the silicon beam , and thus its resonance frequency . by measuring the resonance frequencies of the system , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the comb - drive actuator and the silicon beam behave as two strongly coupled resonators . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the effective coupling rate ( @xmath0 mhz ) is tunable with the comb - drive actuator ( @xmath1% ) as well as with a side - gate ( @xmath2% ) placed close to the silicon beam . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the effective spring constant of the system is insensitive to either of them and changes only by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the comb - drive actuator can be used to switch between different coupling rates with a frequency of at least 10 khz .    </S>",
    "<S> micro- and nanoelectromechanical resonators have attracted much attention thanks to their potential application as sensors @xcite , filters  @xcite , amplifiers  @xcite , and logic gates  @xcite , with frequencies varying from the khz to the ghz range  @xcite . by applying tension , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance frequencies can be tuned in - situ  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually done by applying a dc voltage to a nearby gate to induce a deformation of the resonator via the electrostatic potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , one does not only induce tension by applying an electrostatic potential , but one also changes the number of charge carriers  @xcite , which both affect the properties of the resonator  @xcite . an ideal candidate to circumvent this problem is the comb - drive actuator , which is nowadays widely used to detect accelerations and rotations as well as to manipulate , stretch , or move objects  @xcite . by mechanically fixing a resonator to a comb - drive , one can purely mechanically induce strain in the resonator . depending on the type of comb - drive actuator , this induced strain can be either tensile or compressive . </S>",
    "<S> the former allows the disentanglement of strain and charge carrier density effects in mechanical resonators , whereas the latter is particularly relevant to gain control over buckling modes in mechanical resonators  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> coupled micro- and nanomechanical resonators are known to show sensitive sympathetic oscillation dynamics that show better performance in potential applications than a single resonator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one major challenge for this type of resonators is an in - situ control over the coupling  @xcite . from a fundamental point of view , </S>",
    "<S> a tunable mechanical coupling is interesting because of the feasibility to coherently manipulate phonon populations in coupled resonators  @xcite and to create intrinsically localized modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> from an applied point of view , researchers are able to build novel mass sensors , bandpass filters , and single - electron detectors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fast in - situ control over the coupling between mechanical resonators is an important step towards mechanical logic gates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> comb drives are suspended microelectromechanical systems based on springs , which typically have a resonance frequency in the ( low ) khz range  @xcite . once attaching a resonator to this type of micromachine </S>",

    "<S> we show that the device behaves as a system with two strongly coupled resonators , with a coupling rate @xmath4 mhz , which is tunable up to @xmath1% with the comb - drive actuator as well as down to @xmath2% with a side - gate ( sg ) placed close to the silicon beam .    </S>",
    "<S> the devices are fabricated on a substrate consisting of 500 @xmath5 m silicon , 1 @xmath5 m sio@xmath6 and 1.6 @xmath5 m highly doped silicon . using standard e - beam lithography , a chromium hard mask </S>",
    "<S> is deposited after which reactive ion etching is used to etch away the highly doped silion . </S>",
    "<S> after removal of the hard mask , the sio@xmath6 layer is partly etched away with 10% hydrofluoric ( hf ) acid solution to suspend the comb - drive actuator and silicon beam . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a critical point dryer ( cpd ) is used to suspend the structure and protect it from collapsing to the underlying silicon layer . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a shows a typical device with all its electrical contacts of highly doped silicon . </S>",

    "<S> a close up is provided in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c showing the high aspect ratio @xmath7 in our device . </S>",
    "<S> all the measurements were performed using an amplitude modulated down - mixing technique  @xcite in a variable temperature insert at a temperature of @xmath8 2.3 k.        a schematic overview of the electronic measurement circuit is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]d . </S>",
    "<S> the capacitors @xmath9 nf and resistors @xmath10 @xmath11 are chosen for impedance matching and for decoupling any high frequency signals . </S>",

    "<S> both @xmath12 and @xmath13 tune the strain in the silicon beam . in addition , to mechanically excite the silicon beam , an ac voltage @xmath15 at frequency @xmath16 is applied to sg . </S>",

    "<S> an ac voltage @xmath17 at frequency @xmath18 and , simultaneously , at frequency @xmath19 is applied to the source ( s ) - drain ( d ) contacts of the silicon beam . as a consequence , </S>",

    "<S> ii for room temperature measurements ) . surprisingly , there are two clear resonant modes . </S>",
    "<S> the low - frequency resonant mode in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b exhibits almost no tunability as function of @xmath12 or @xmath33 , to which we will refer as the `` low sensitive mode '' ( lsm ) , whereas the high - frequency resonant mode is at least @xmath34 times more sensitive to @xmath12 and @xmath33 and will therefore be called the `` highly sensitive mode '' ( hsm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the resonance frequencies are obtained by fitting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq - current ] to the raw data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted resonance frequencies in dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a and [ fig3]b , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that tensile strain in the silicon beam induced by the comb - drive actuator via @xmath12 increases the resonance frequency of the hsm , whereas an out - of - plane bending of the silicon beam induced by @xmath13 effectively lowers the resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> all extracted resonance frequencies of the same measurement lie on a quadratic polynomial , as shown with orange and gray solid curves ( and pink and light gray dashed curves ) in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a and [ fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> these tunabilities are in agreement with the behavior of the capacitive force between the sg and the silicon beam on the comb - drive actuator , which always scales quadratically with applied voltage , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 , corresponding to the strain hardening and the capacitive softening  @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that there are slight deviations for the center position at @xmath37 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) due to residual charges from the fabrictaion process or a capacitve crosstalk between the sg and the comb - drive .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed two resonant modes in our system are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> in the theoretical model ( see suppl . mat . </S>",
    "<S> i ) , our device is described by a beam attached to a mass , in which a transverse and an axial drive force act on the beam . </S>",
    "<S> the beam is doubly clamped in axial direction and oscillates in the transverse direction , whereas the mass can only move in the axial direction . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dynamics of this system can be expressed by the following equations of motion , @xmath38 in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the time dependent part of the oscillations of the beam and the mass , respectively , i.e. the silicon beam and the comb - drive . @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe the normalized effective springs , @xmath5 is the normalized mass ratio between the comb - drive and the silicon beam , and @xmath43 indicates the coupling between these two oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> all these parameters are related to @xmath12 and @xmath13 via the static bending of the silicon beam , and the intrinsic properties of the device : the young s modulus , the spring constant , the mass density , the geometry and the capacitive couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted resonance frequencies are as follows , @xmath44    the frequencies obtained with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqthsolution1 ] are in qualitatively good agreement with experimental data ( blue and red curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a and [ fig3]b ) , which allows us to specify the mode type to the hsm and the lsm . </S>",
    "<S> according to the theory , the hsm depends on the induced tensile strain in the silicon beam with the comb - drive actuator and is therefore attributed to the silicon beam ; the lsm does not show a strong dependence on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and represents the resonance of the comb - drive actuator . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that these modes are so close together , suggests that they are strongly coupled due to the clamping of the silicon beam on the comb - drive actuator . </S>",
    "<S> note that the theory shows quantitatively good agreement with the experiment in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not describe the experimental sg voltage dependence very well ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) , which is due to the following approximations in the theory : the transverse force acts on the entire length of the beam and the neglected capacitive softening .    </S>",
    "<S> we find an additional proof for two strongly coupled modes by comparison with a very similar device but with fixed comb - drive ( see suppl . mat . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) . in this case , we observe only a single resonant mode , indicating that the mechanical system lost 1 degree of freedom , which is the motion of the comb - drive . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the quality factor in this case is @xmath8 10 000 which is approximately 10 to 100 times larger than the quality factor of the device where the comb - drive actuator is movable ( see suppl . mat . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a significant amount of energy is transferred from the silicon beam into the comb - drive actuator and vice versa .    to investigate the actual effective spring and effective coupling rate , the system of two strongly coupled resonators is described by the following system of equations , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are effective displacements . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are the two resonance frequencies @xmath48 and @xmath49 defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqthsolution1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath50 is the ( squared ) effective spring of the system and @xmath51 is the ( squared ) effective coupling rate , which are listed in table  [ table1 ] for specific @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the extracted effective spring and coupling rate show completely different behavior ( see fig .  [ fig3]c and [ fig3]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effective spring @xmath52 is only weakly dependent on both @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum change in @xmath52 of only 0.5% is observed in our measurements , which could be attributed to the large difference in masses of the two oscillating parts . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the effective coupling rate @xmath53 can be increased up to @xmath54% by applying tensile strain through @xmath12 , or it can be decreased down to @xmath54% by applying an out - of - plane bending through @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our device geometry gives us an independent knob to control the coupling between the two resonators .    </S>",
    "<S> m0.2|m0.17<m0.19<|m0.17<m0.19 < & & + & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 + coupling rate [ mhz ] & 1.72 & 1.75 & 1.48 & 1.47 + effective spring [ mhz ] & 11.60 & 11.60 & 11.57 & 11.57 +    as the effective coupling rate @xmath53 is tunable over 10% with the comb - drive actuator , we can use @xmath12 as a control voltage to switch between different coupling rates . theoretically , it is even possible to fast switch the coupling between the two attached resonators , showing the feasibility of mechanical logic gates . to show that one can indeed use the comb - drive actuator as a switch , we applied square pulses with a frequency of 10 khz to the comb - drive actuator ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the period of this frequency was chosen to be far above the response time of the comb - drive actuator and the silicon beam , which were estimated from the resonance frequency and its quality factor to be 36 @xmath5s and 12 @xmath5s respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for large square pulse amplitudes , the resonance frequency indeed splits into two , which shows the possibility to switch the coupling rate between the two resonators . here </S>",
    "<S> , the coupling rate is switched between 1.39 mhz and 1.61 mhz at the pulse amplitude 5 v.        in conclusion , we presented an electromechanical system , in which a silicon beam was attached to a comb - drive actuator to control the tension that operates at cryogenic temperatures . by measuring the resonance frequencies of the system </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that the device behaves as two strongly coupled resonators . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the effective coupling rate ( @xmath0 mhz ) is tunable with the comb - drive actuator ( + 10% ) as well as with a side - gate ( -10% ) placed close to the silicon beam . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the effective spring constant of the system is insensitive to an applied voltage to either the comb - drive actuator or the side - gate . from an applied point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the high tunability of coupling rate would be very interesting if two resonators are attached to the comb - drive actuator as multifunctional force sensors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we showed that the comb - drive actuator can be used to switch between different coupling rates with a frequency of at least 10 khz , which is particularly interesting for future mechanical logic devices in which it is necessary to fast switch between two states . </S>"
