    "we propose to produce polarized proton beam from the polarized atomic beam source , accelerate it in the 1.5 gev booster and then in the u-70 main ring up to 70 gev , extract it from the main ring and deliver to several experimental setups to :    measure the gluon and quark polarization in longitudinally polarized protons in charmonium production to help to solve the problem of `` spin crisis '' ;    measure the double - spin transversity distribution in transversely polarized protons by using the drell - yan muon pair production ;    measure dependence of single - spin asymmetries(ssa ) on separate kinematic variables p@xmath6 and x@xmath7 and hadron type to study the possible non - perturbative origion of ssa ;    measure miscellaneous spin parameters in hyperon production at moderate transverse momenta to learn about role of strange quarks in the spin structure of nucleon ;    measure polarization and spin correlation parameters in elastic pp - scatering in the hard scattering region in order to check the qcd predictions .",
    "although years of experimental effort at miscellaneous accelerators have provided a lot of information about the qcd hard scattering and the parton structure of the proton , there is no corresponding body of data on the spin - dependence of the elementary interactions and the spin structure of the proton . high intensity",
    "polarized proton beam accelerated up to 70 gev and extracted from the u70 main ring offers the opportunity to study the unique properties of the spin variable at large x to increase the understanding of these fundamental quantities .",
    "final goals of spin physics at u70 are :    study the spin structure of the proton , i.e. , how the proton s spin state can be obtained from a superposition of fock states with different numbers of constituents with nonzero spin ;    study how the dynamics of constituent interactions depends on spin degrees of freedom and on the flavors ;    understand chiral symmetry breaking and helicity non - conservation on the quark and hadron levels ;    study the overall nucleon spin structure in the range of moderate p@xmath6(up to 5 gev / c ) , and the long range qcd dynamics ( confinement ) , including study non - perturbative interactions of massive constituent quarks with an effective color field of flux tubes , produced by confined quarks and gluons .",
    "these issues are closely interrelated at the hadron level and the results of the experimental measurements are to be interpreted in terms of hadron spin structure convoluted with the constituent interaction dynamics .",
    "to do this spin physics , the polarized proton beam with an intensity up to 10@xmath8 protons per spill and energy up to 70 gev needs to be accelerated .",
    "this process starts from an intensive polarized proton source .",
    "a polarization value of the beam needs to be measured continuosly by polarimeters .",
    "the setups should include polarized targets if double - spin measurements are being planned .",
    "+ to achieve high luminosity in the interactions of polarized beams with the targets , the intensity of the planned polarized proton source should be sufficient .",
    "this source is expected to be designed and built at the institute of nuclear research , troitsk .",
    "it will be an atomic beam - type polarized ion source .",
    "the source might produce up to 5 ma of h@xmath9 with 90@xmath10 polarization .",
    "+ during acceleration , the polarization may be lost when the spin precession frequency passes through a so - called depolarizing resonance .",
    "these resonances occur when the spin tune @xmath11@xmath12 g ( where g=1.793 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton and @xmath11=e / m ) is equal to an integer number ( imperfection resonances ) , or equal to kp@xmath13@xmath14 ( intrinsic resonances ) . here",
    "p=12 is the superperiod of the u70 accelerator , @xmath14=9.9 is the vertical betatron tune , and k is an integer .",
    "imperfection resonances are due to vertical closed orbit errors and intrinsic resonances are due to the vertical betatron motion .",
    "it is possible to preserve a high polarization value , sort of 70@xmath10 over the acceleration of the polarized proton beam up to 70 gev if one installs three partial siberian snakes in the main ring of the u-70 with the snake `` strength '' w=@xmath15 /2",
    "@xmath16 = 0.18 .",
    "three definite long streight line sections ( 4.87 m each ) in the u-70 main ring need to be cleaned up from the existing equipment .",
    "much more details can be found in the report of yu.m.shatunov @xcite .",
    "+ there should be two types of polarimeters at u70 : 1 ) absolute polarimeter to determine a value and a sign of polarization with a high accuracy and 2 ) less accurate but fast relative polarimeter .",
    "the both polarimeters should be based on coulomb - nuclear interference ( cni ) effect .",
    "the absolute polarimeter could be built with the use of a polarized jet target , while the relative polarimeter with the use of carbon thin target .",
    "the absolute polarimeter calibrates the relative one .",
    "the polarization of proton beam circulated in the u70 averaged over 100 hours data taking could be measured to 10@xmath10 statistical accuracy with the use of hydrogen jet .",
    "the detail description of the polarimetry for u70 can be found in the report of s.b.nurushev @xcite .",
    "+ longitudinally and transversely polarized targets are needed for double - spin measurements .",
    "the effect of a high intensity polarized proton beam is to deposit a significant amount of heat in the target .",
    "it is thus necessary to use @xmath17he evaporation refrigirators to cool the target , instead of dilution refrigirators , even though the lower temperatures achievable in dilution refrigirators often results in higher polarizations .",
    "a second effect of the high intensity beam is a significant amount of radiation damage in the target material .",
    "materials that are chemically doped typically perform poorly under conditions of high - radiation damage , so radiation - doped materials , typically ammonia ( @xmath18nh@xmath19 ) or lithium ( @xmath20lid ) hybrides , are used .",
    "these continuous pumping polarized targets are the best ones to work with high intensity beams up to 10@xmath21 p/[@xmath22 s ] .",
    "the studies of the spin effects in inclusive processes probe the spin dependence of the incoherent hadronic interaction dynamics . the cross  sections of the hard production processes are described in the perturbative qcd as a convolution integral of parton cross - sections with the light ",
    "cone parton densities .",
    "the primary goal of the single - spin measurements with hadronic final states would be a study where the onset of perturbative qcd regime occurs .",
    "it is usually assumed , that single - spin transverse asymmetries in inclusive process @xmath23 , where a is a polarized hadron , have higher twist origin @xcite .",
    "the contribution of higher twists should be small at high energies and at small distances @xmath24 .",
    "there are some indications that such contributions are small even at not too high energies and @xmath25 values .",
    "in particular , it follows from the recent data on the spin structure function @xmath26 obtained at slac .",
    "if it is the case , the observed significant one - spin asymmetries in hadronic processes are to be associated with the manifestation of a nonperturbative dynamics",
    ".    the measurements of one - spin transverse asymmetries will be important probe of the chiral structure of the effective qcd lagrangian .",
    "the available experimental data are at some variance with pqcd predictions : these data do not at least show up tendency to converge to the vanishing single - spin asymmetries in inclusive and elastic hadron productions .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for the explanation of the observed single - spin effects .",
    "r8.5 cm    single transverse spin asymmetries in hard processes are expected to vanish in perturbative qcd at the leading twist ( twist-2 ) level , however this is no longer true if one considers higher twist contributions .",
    "twist-3 contribution @xcite leads to a potentially larger asymmetry .",
    "a measurement of higher twist effects not only provides a valuable test on perturbative qcd , it also yields information on the hadron structure .",
    "the higher twist distributions represent correlations between quarks and gluons inside a hadron .",
    "these correlations have specific structures in qcd .",
    "if extracted from experimental data , they provide useful constraints on nucleon models , in particular , the non - valence degrees of freedom that include sea quarks and gluons .",
    "other world wide known possible sources of the observed one - spin asymmetries could be : correlation of @xmath27 and spin in initial state @xcite ( sivers effect ) and fragmentation @xcite functions ( collins effect ) .",
    "usually we have combinations of these effects together with twist-3 effect in a particular experiment and special technics are required to extract them from observed asymmetries .",
    "there are also other theoretical approaches to explain large single - spin asymmetry in inclusive hadron reactions such as rotation of valence quarks inside a hadron @xcite and the coherent rotation of the quark matter inside the constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "the stern - gerlach type of force @xcite which acts on chromomagnetic quark moment in color flux tube field @xcite , is able to explain many features of ssa dependence on hadron type and kinematic variables .",
    "the study of charged hadron inclusive reactions at u-70 energies is important as a clear test of perturbative qcd regime and nonperturbative dynamical models . in general , these studies are important for the understanding of the qcd vaccuum and transitions between the perturbative and nonperturbative phases .",
    "a detailed high precision study of ssa dependence on kinematic variables and hadron type allows to discriminate some of the proposed models and the origion mechanisms .",
    "+ asymmetries in inclusive production of charged pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons can be measured by focusing double arm spectrometer ( fods ) which is placed at the beam line 22 at ihep .",
    "the experimental setup fods is shown in fig .",
    "[ vasiliev_fig1 ] .",
    "it consists of the analyzing magnet , drift chambers , spectrometer of cherenkov radiation ( scoch ) for particle identification ( charged pions , kaons , protons and anti - protons ) , scintillation counters and hadron calorimeters to make trigger on high energy hadrons .",
    "there are two arms which can be rotated around the target center situated in front of the magnet to change secondary particle angle .",
    "the radiation shielding in the beam line allows to work with a beam intensity up to 10@xmath28 p / s , and the setup up to 10@xmath29 p / s .",
    "+ the following single - spin measurements can be done at fods :    precise measurements of @xmath30 in inclusive production of charged pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons at hydrogen and nuclear targets .",
    "large @xmath31 can be achieved . to separate @xmath32 and @xmath33 asymmetry dependences ,",
    "the measurements at several angles are needed ( might be done in the range of 10 - 130@xmath34 in c.m . ) .",
    "measurements of @xmath30 in symmetric hadron production .",
    "symmetric pairs ( @xmath16@xmath35 and @xmath16@xmath9,etc ) are the hadrons produced in the c.m . with about the same momenta and moving in the opposite directions . for these processes",
    "@xmath36 is almost zero and there is no sivers effect .",
    "measurements of @xmath30 in drell - yan muon pairs .",
    "there is no fragmentation in this process - this means that there is no collins effect .",
    "( additional absorbers in each arm will be installed ) .",
    "from deep inelastic scattering , one can measure @xmath37 related to the spin - averaged longitudinal momentum distribution of quarks in the nucleon and @xmath38 related to the helicity distribution in a longitudinally- polarized nucleon .",
    "in addition to these two well - known structure functions , there exists a third fundamental function , @xmath39 , which is a leading twist ( twist-2 ) distribution function like @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this third function , which has never been experimentally determined , is accessible by measuring the double transverse spin asymmetry a@xmath40 in certain processes with both beam and target protons transversely polarized .",
    "a measurement of @xmath39 can shed interesting light on the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "in fact , in non - relativistic quark models , the transversity distribution is identical to the quark helicity distribution @xmath38 .",
    "thus , a comparison between the sizes of @xmath39 and @xmath38 would measure the success of these models in treating the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the function @xmath39 , unlike the helicity function @xmath38 , can not be measured in deep inelastic scattering due to its different properties under chiral transformations .",
    "quark transversity is a new observable for understanding the hadron wave function in terms of bare quarks .",
    "gluons give no contribution to the transverse spin of the proton .",
    "it is promising to explore this new spin observable and compare it with the longitudinal spin densities .",
    "with transversely polarized beams the new field of transverse spin effects can be explored in the drell - yan muon - pair channel by measuring the correlation of the plane of the muon - pair to the spin axis .",
    "this provides a clean approach to quark transversity , h@xmath41(x ) .",
    "a beam dump experiment might be an appropriate one to measure transversity in drell - yan muon pairs .",
    "the scheme of the experiment is as follows .",
    "a polarized beam interacts with a polarized target .",
    "there is an absorber just after the target and finally a muon detector to detect drell - yan muon pairs .",
    "an issue will be a hadronic background which can originate from decays of charged pions and kaons before reaching the absorber and from hadrons penetrating the material ( punch - through ) .",
    "r10 cm    if the polarized target can accept an intensity of 10@xmath21 p / spill ( we expect spill duration of 3 s out of 9 s full cycle ) , then the luminosity of this experiment would be about 10@xmath42 @xmath43 s@xmath44 that is three orders of magnitude higher than today at rhic or at the planned pax at gsi .",
