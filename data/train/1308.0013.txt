    "all massive @xmath4 stars undergo core collapse , but only some must explode as core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) . all collapses leading to the formation of a neutron star must have a ccsne to eject mass and avoid collapse to a black hole .",
    "core collapse can lead to the formation of a black hole either through a failed sn , where the stalled accretion shock never revives , or in a successful ccsn where sufficient mass falls back onto the proto - neutron star to cause collapse to a black hole .",
    "little is observationally known about the balance between these scenarios . the diffuse supernova neutrino background sets an upper limit on the failed sn rate at roughly @xmath5-@xmath6 of the observed sn rate ( @xcite ) , and there is some evidence for a mismatch between massive star formation and sn rates , suggesting a significant failed sn rate ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) , but theoretical studies generally favor low rates of failed sne ( @xmath7 of ccsn rate ) at solar metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we know nothing observationally about the formation of black holes in successful ccsne , but it is a relatively common outcome in simulated explosions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    while not directly motivated by understanding the formation of black holes , surveys attempting to provide a census of the progenitor stars to successful sne can reveal the existence of failed sne .",
    "in particular , there appears to be a deficit of high mass progenitor stars compared to standard initial mass functions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , this is best quantified for the deficit of higher mass ( @xmath8 ) red supergiant progenitors ( @xcite ) , and it is interesting to note that this mass range also corresponds to stars with internal structures that make it more difficult for them to explode ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . perhaps this deficit can be explained by observational biases such as stronger dusty winds around more massive stars ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) , or by having stars in this mass range evolve away from being red supergiants before exploding ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , but one simple explanation is that stars in the mass range @xmath9 form black holes without a sn .",
    "the lower limit is set by the upper mass limit @xcite found for type  iip progenitors and @xmath10 is a reasonable estimate for the maximum mass of stars that undergo core collapse as red supergiants ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this mass range corresponds to @xmath3 of core collapses .    in principle , neutrino ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or gravitational wave detection ( e.g. @xcite ) of a core collapse leading to black hole formation , combined with external astronomical observations of any resulting transient , would be the cleanest probe of this phenomenon .",
    "unfortunately , such observations are only feasible in our galaxy and its very nearest neighbors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , so the event rates are unpleasantly low if the failed sn rate is @xmath3 of the sn rate . while any associated visible transient would be more easily observed in a nearby galaxy , almost all events in the galaxy would be observable in the near - ir despite the high extinction in the galactic plane ( see @xcite ) .    after pointing out the deficit of higher mass sn progenitors in @xcite",
    ", we also outlined an approach to identifying black hole formation events without accompanying sn that was independent of the nature of any intervening transient .",
    "one carries out a `` disappearance '' experiment , monitoring a large number of evolved massive stars to see if any `` vanish '' .",
    "we advocated this approach because the nature of the phenomenology that occurs between presence and absence was unclear and little studied .",
    "some stars have density structures that would literally allow a direct collapse with almost no external signature ( @xcite ) , others might go through a phase where accretion onto the the black hole temporally and almost certainly unstably supports the remaining stellar envelope , or a weak shock might reach the surface of the star to create a weak explosive transient ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our point in @xcite was that a search for black hole formation in failed sne could be carried out independent of whether there was an associated , external transient because the initial and final states of the system were well defined . moreover , this is the only direct detection method that is likely to succeed in the near term given supernova rates and the limited sensitivities of present and future neutrino and gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the last available probe of these physical processes is the mass function of the resulting neutron stars and black holes .",
    "we show the observed masses of these remnants in figure  [ fig : ozel ] using the summaries from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while this has many observational issues because we can only measure masses in binary systems , the observed mass function has three striking features ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first , neutron star masses have a narrow distribution .",
    "second , there is a significant gap between the mass distribution of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "third , while very high mass black holes exist , the typical black hole is far less massive than the stars believed to have created it .",
    "@xcite argue that selection effects due to the requirements for producing accreting binaries may bias the observed distributions against higher mass black holes ( @xmath11 ) but should not be producing a gap between neutron stars and black holes .",
    "roughly marks the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    "the relative numbers of neutron stars and black holes can not be quantitatively compared .",
    ", width=528 ]     and @xmath12 .",
    "the models predict distributions dominated by low mass ( @xmath13 ) black holes and lack any clear gap between the masses of neutron stars and black holes . the thick solid line at @xmath14 roughly marks the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    ", width=528 ]    the simplest physical possibility would have been that successful sne explosions lead to neutron stars with ( roughly ) the mass of the iron core ( less neutrino losses etc . ) and failed explosions lead to a black hole with the mass of the star at death .",
    "this would naturally lead to a gap in mass , with neutron stars having a mass @xmath15 and black holes having the final stellar mass .",
    "the problem is that almost all stars at death are more massive than the typical mass of the observed black holes . in standard models ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , this forces black holes to be made in the course of successful ccsne explosions so that mass can be ejected .",
    "the explosion is initiated in the core and the initial mass of the proto - neutron star is similar to an explosion in which a neutron star is formed , but there is then significant `` fall back '' of material onto the neutron star leading to the formation of a black hole .",
    "this allows formation of black holes less massive than their progenitor stars , but requires fine tuning of stellar mass loss and explosion energies .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to avoid a continuous distribution of remnant masses without the observed gap between neutron stars and black holes .",
    "these problems are illustrated in figure  [ fig : old ] , where we show the remnant mass distributions predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we fully explain the construction of figure  [ fig : old ] in  2 .",
    "the @xcite models have no gap , while the @xcite models partially create one by changing the explosion energetics with progenitor mass ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "one practical difference between these models is that the @xcite models were constructed in part to explain the remnant mass distribution while the @xcite models were not .",
    "perhaps the lack of similarity between the observed ( figure  [ fig : ozel ] ) and model ( figure  [ fig : old ] ) distributions is purely observational , but perhaps it is also evidence that fall back is not a good mechanism for explaining the masses of black holes .",
    "_ in fact , simply accepting the evidence from progenitor studies that red supergiant stars with masses of @xmath9 suffer failed supernova explosions and form black holes provides a new and very natural explanation for both the existence of the gap and the typical masses of black holes . _",
    "the key is the observation by @xcite that the envelopes of red supergiants are so weakly bound that the weakening of the gravitational potential created by the mass lost in neutrinos during core collapse is sufficient to unbind the hydrogen envelope of the star .",
    "@xcite carried out detailed radiation - hydrodynamic simulations of this mechanism for @xmath16 and @xmath10 red supergiants , finding that the adjustment of the envelope to the neutrino mass loss can trigger a weak shock that unbinds the envelope as @xcite predicted .",
    "the result is a low luminosity ( @xmath17 ) , cool ( @xmath18  k ) transient lasting roughly one year and largely powered by the recombination energy of the envelope .",
    "@xcite notes that there is also a shock break out pulse which is @xmath19-@xmath20 times brighter , hotter ( @xmath21  k ) and lasting roughly a week .",
    "the key point for the remnant mass distribution is that the natural mass scale of the resulting black hole is the mass of the helium core of the progenitor star , thereby reproducing both the gap between neutron star and black hole masses and the characteristic minimum masses of black holes with no need for fine tuning stellar mass loss , the explosion mechanism , the amount of fall back , or binary evolution . in  2 we show some simple models of mass functions based on this idea and how to fit a significant population of failed sne into the overall accounting for the deaths of massive stars . in ",
    "3 we discuss some additional implications and strategies for identifying these events .",
    "we generated figure  [ fig : old ] using the following assumptions .",
    "we drew the progenitor masses from a salpeter imf over the mass range @xmath22 , although the upper mass limit is quantitatively unimportant .",
    "we then assigned masses either by interpolating over the @xcite models or using the analytic approximations in @xcite .",
    "we used the solar metallicity sa model from @xcite , corresponding to an energy of @xmath23  bethe and a piston located at a fixed entropy per particle of @xmath24 . above and below the tabulated range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 we simply used the results for the appropriate limiting mass . for the @xcite models we assigned @xmath27 remnant masses to progenitors with @xmath28 .",
    "as noted in  1 , the results predict a continuum of black hole and neutron star masses and lack a clear peak in the observed mass range of black holes . when comparing figures  [ fig : ozel ] and [ fig : old ] one should not be comparing the relative numbers of black holes and neutron stars , but only the two classes separately . in @xcite",
    "we modeled the masses of binary neutron stars from @xcite and found that they strongly disfavored models in which there was any fall back mass , while all the models used in figure  [ fig : old ] must include fall back because it is the only way they can produce any low mass black holes .    in the @xcite mechanism , as confirmed by the simulations of @xcite , the remnant mass from the failed sn of a red supergiant is set by the mass of the helium core of the star .",
    "there may be some hydrogen fall back contribution , but in the @xcite simulations it is small .",
    "figure  [ fig : pmass ] shows the pre - sn mass , helium core mass , and the mass of the @xmath29 core for the pre - sn stellar models of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 core mass is a good proxy for neutron star masses in the absence of fall back and is defined by the point in the core where there is a significant jump in the electron abundance @xmath29 . in @xcite",
    "we found that the mass of the @xmath29 core with no fall back was one of the better models for the mass distribution of binary neutron stars . in this model sequence ,",
    "mass loss becomes increasingly important above @xmath30 .",
    "stars in the mass range corresponding to the missing red supergiant progenitors have helium core masses of between @xmath31 and @xmath2 , almost exactly corresponding to the observed mass range of black holes .",
    "core , which will roughly correspond to the mass of any resulting neutron star , and the mass of the helium core .",
    "note the enormous mass loss associated with the higher mass stars .",
    "the shaded region encompass the mass range from @xmath32 to @xmath10 that we associate with failed supernovae .",
    ", width=528 ]     to @xmath10 leads to the formation of black holes with the helium core mass from the models of @xcite ( figure  [ fig : pmass ] ) . outside this mass range",
    "we continue to use the results from @xcite ( solid ) and @xcite , where dotted lines show the distribution for rapid explosions and dashed lines show the distribution for delayed explosions .",
    "the distributions are normalized by the average number of remnants between @xmath31 and @xmath12 .",
    "the black hole mass distributions now have a distinct peak in the observed mass range and far fewer low mass black holes .",
    "these low mass black holes could be completely eliminated by adopting explosion models with no fall back . the thick solid line at @xmath14 roughly marks the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    ", width=528 ]    we can now examine the remnant mass distribution if the more massive red supergiants undergo failed sn but eject their hydrogen envelopes based on the @xcite mechanism",
    ". figure  [ fig : new ] shows the remnant mass distributions after we replace the remnant masses from the underlying models for the mass range @xmath33 with the helium core mass shown in figure  [ fig : pmass ] .",
    "for all three cases , there is now a far more distinct peak at the observed masses of black holes , and a greatly reduced production of unobserved low mass black holes .",
    "the effect is most dramatic for the @xcite model where the fraction of black holes ( remnant masses @xmath34 ) with masses between @xmath1 and @xmath12 rises from 6% to 46% . even for",
    "the @xcite models , where the parameters were in part tuned to better reproduce the mass function of binary black holes , the fractions rise from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite argue that adding such a population of failed sne is difficult to reconcile with attempts to distribute sn types over the imf .",
    "the essence of the argument is that the type  iip fraction of @xmath37 found by @xcite is so low that the proposed failed sn mass range of @xmath9 needs to produce non - type  iip sne in order to match the observed sn type fractions .",
    "for example , in the absence of binaries , assigning the mass range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 to producing type  iip sne , and @xmath40 to producing non - type  iip sne has a 48% type  iip fraction and is consistent ( @xmath41 for 1  dof ) with the estimates of @xmath42 and @xmath43 by @xcite .",
    "however , this leaves no room to allot a mass range containing @xmath3 of progenitors to failed sne .    rather than being evidence against failed sne , this is really evidence for the importance of binaries , which was discussed by @xcite in other contexts . since we lack a fully quantitative understanding of either mass loss by individual stars or mass transfer in binaries , we only consider three classes of objects .",
    "there are type  iip sn , which we attribute to lower mass stars ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "these limits are chosen to match the mass range found to be associated with type  iip sne by @xcite .",
    "non - iip sn are a combination of high mass stars ( @xmath45 ) that have lost mass due to either stellar evolution or binary mass transfer and a fraction @xmath46 of the iip mass range where binary interactions lead to a non - iip sn .",
    "the mass scale @xmath47 is roughly the highest mass at which stars both undergo core collapse as red supergiants and the range of progenitor masses which can be more difficult to explode ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the mass range @xmath48 leads to a failed sn .",
    "the interacting binary fraction is expected to be very high .",
    "for example , @xcite estimate that for o stars at birth , roughly 30% are effectively single , 24% merge , 33% undergo some envelope stripping and 14% have some accretion , which means it is perfectly plausible that @xmath49 of stars in the iip mass range become non - iip sne due to interactions . in the iip mass range ,",
    "the donor star explodes as a non - iip sn because of the mass transfer , and the recipient can explode as a non - iip sn because it now evolves as a more massive star with greater mass loss .",
    "we discuss the potential effects of this binary fraction on the phenomenology of the failed sne in  3 .    under these assumptions",
    ", we can simply solve for the binary fraction required to leave a 48% type  iip fraction for successful sne . for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "this results in a binary fraction of @xmath53 which is quite reasonable . raising the upper mass limit for failed sne to @xmath54",
    "only requires raising the binary fraction to @xmath55 . for @xmath52 and",
    "the higher type  iip fraction of 59% found by @xcite the binary fraction need only be @xmath56 .",
    "given all the other uncertainties , the main point is simply that given a reasonable fraction of binary - induced sn type transformations ( from iip to not iip ) , there is no difficulty accommodating a significant rate of failed sne in an accounting of sn types over the initial mass function .",
    "figure  [ fig : smith ] illustrates this graphically following the similar figures by @xcite .    , and we discuss how this may affect the phenomenology of the failed sne in  3 . , width=528 ]",
    "assuming that high mass red supergiants die as failed sne naturally solves two observational puzzles : ( 1 ) the failure to find progenitors in this mass range ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , and ( 2 ) the peculiar mass distribution of compact remnants ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . while we lack a fully predictive theory of core collapse events , it is also true that many stellar models in this mass range have density structures that render them more difficult to explode ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "models of successful sne can form black holes with masses of @xmath1 to @xmath12 by carefully tuning the stellar mass loss and the explosion energetics to achieve the correct amount of mass fall back .",
    "we used the examples of @xcite , which poorly matches the observed black hole mass distribution , and @xcite , which does better .",
    "however , if we simply excise the mass range from @xmath57 to @xmath58 from these models and instead make them failed sne in which the hydrogen envelope is ejected by the @xcite mechanism , then we naturally create large numbers of black holes in the observed mass range .",
    "the mass scale comes naturally from the mechanism because only the weakly bound hydrogen envelope can be ejected .",
    "the black hole mass scale is simply the mass of the helium cores of the stars ending their lives as failed sne .",
    "since there is no longer any need to tune the amount of fall back mass to produce low mass black holes in successful sne , we could now allow all successful sne to form neutron stars with no fall back , which would eliminate the residual problem that other progenitor mass ranges also produce low mass black holes in the @xcite or @xcite models . having no fall back would also better match the neutron star mass distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , one could add a population of failed sn associated with more compact , higher mass stars where the final mass would be that of the star at the time of explosion .",
    "the key point for models of the remnant mass distribution is that the @xcite mechanism provides a means of producing @xmath59 black holes that does not depend on either mass loss or the fall back mechanism .",
    "if we build a simple model where stars from @xmath60 to @xmath32 produce type  iip sne unless modified by binary interactions , stars from @xmath32 to @xmath10 produce failed sne , and higher mass stars produce non - iip sne , then it is easy to match the @xcite sn type fractions if roughly @xmath61 of potential iip progenitors are modified by binary interactions and become non - iip sne .",
    "in such a model , 18% of core collapses fail , corresponding to a failed sn rate that is @xmath62 of the sn rate . using the higher iip fraction found by @xcite",
    "allows a lower binary modification fraction .",
    "invoking such a fraction of binary interactions is consistent with the estimates of @xcite from the statistics of o star binaries .",
    "if we translate the luminosities and temperatures estimated by @xcite and @xcite into magnitudes assuming black body spectra , the absolute visual magnitude of the transient and the shock break out pulses are roughly @xmath63  mag ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65  mag ( @xmath66 ) , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transient is significantly brighter at longer wavelengths because of its low temperature .",
    "if we assume that the typical type  iip magnitude is @xmath67  mag , then a field survey finding @xmath68 type  iip sne should find @xmath69 @xcite events , where the magnitude dependence is created by the ( euclidean ) dependence of the survey volume on transient luminosity . for the extended , cool transient , the expected numbers are very low , @xmath70 to @xmath71 depending on the survey band pass .",
    "this phase of the transient also does not stand out significantly from other slow variations in high luminosity stars .",
    "hence , as suggested by @xcite , normal sn surveys should focus on the shock break out pulse from these events where the expected number would be @xmath72 .",
    "such a search will require cadences closer to daily than weekly in order to sample the transient well - enough to have confidence in the detection and to motivate a search for the longer duration , fainter transient with larger telescopes .",
    "fortunately , the break out peak and duration appear to occupy a region of transient space without significant , known backgrounds , as they should be significantly more luminous than classical novae of the same duration . achieving a 90% confidence limit of @xmath73",
    "requires a survey where the expectation value is 2.3 events , so surveys containing @xmath74 type  iip sne that could have detected the break out peaks of these transients at high efficiency will begin to provide strong constraints on the existence of this mechanism .",
    "as presently designed , however , most field surveys for sn have cadences that will make it difficult to achieve a high efficiency for detection of these transients since they will sample the events poorly ( e.g. cadences of 5 , 7 and 3  days for ptf , pan - starrs1 and lsst , respectively , see @xcite for a summary of surveys ) .",
    "a targeted survey focused on nearby galaxies , such as our more general search for failed supernovae ( @xcite ) , has little prospect of detecting the break out pulse because of its low cadence ( @xmath75 monthly ) , but would have no difficulty following the longer transient since it was already designed to search for the disappearance of far less luminous stars . here",
    "the rate is limited simply by the rarity of the sne , since @xmath76/year for local galaxies , leading to an expected rate of @xmath77/year for this class of failed supernovae .",
    "thus , achieving a 90% confidence limit that @xmath73 requires two decades of monitoring nearby galaxies which is painfully long but entirely feasible .",
    "of course if @xmath78 , the probability of finding such an event in a decade is quite high ( 86% ) and it is only for these nearby events that we are guaranteed to be able to convincingly say that the progenitor star has vanished .    finally , we should not expect all these events to have the luminous counterparts predicted by @xcite . first , as noted by @xcite , the neutrino mass loss may not be large enough to trigger envelope ejection in all cases .",
    "second , like the stars which eventually have successful sne , a significant fraction of the stars that will become failed sne will be in binaries and will have part or all of their hydrogen envelopes stripped before death . to the extent that the interior structure that will lead to a failed sne is not significantly altered by the mass loss",
    ", these stars will still end as failed sne .",
    "if there is remaining hydrogen and it is still in an extended , low binding energy envelope , then we would still expect a transient associated with core collapse but it would be weaker . in some senses , these would be the failed sn equivalents of type iil or iib sne .",
    "if the mass loss leads the envelope to collapse or if all the hydrogen is stripped , then there would likely be no luminous transient .",
    "since we are unable to predict the outcome of core collapse from first principles , it is difficult to address these scenarios quantitatively . however , if @xmath79 of stars which would otherwise become iip sne do not do so because of binary interactions , we might expect a similar fraction of failed sne to be modified .",
