    "the case for the existence of a @xmath0-like component dominating the currently observable universe is now compelling @xcite . in the simplest models such a component has two quite independent properties . on the one hand ,",
    "it does not cluster on scales much smaller than the hubble scale , @xmath1 , and on the other it influences the background evolution of the cosmos , causing acceleration at very recent redshifts and giving rise to the coincidence problem  why do we appear to be living at a special time in the universe s history ? while it is possible to construct models which exhibit only one of these properties , eg . @xcite , both now have observational support . in particular , the recent detection of cross - correlations between the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and various tracers of large scale structure @xcite , which are consistent with the decay of perturbations on large scales due to an accelerating background , make construction of convincing non - accelerating models difficult .",
    "however , despite its success at the purely phenomenological level , the standard @xmath0cdm model has almost no deep understanding to back it up .",
    "we are in the age of precision book - keeping in cosmology , but despite many attempts we do not yet have even a well - founded theoretical order - of - magnitude estimate of the size of the cosmological constant : most nave field theory calculations disagree by @xmath2 with observations , yielding perhaps the worst estimate in the history of physics .",
    "one can improve the situation somewhat by invoking supersymmetry , but it proves generically quite hard to construct supergravity vacua with positive cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the string theory case is even harder @xcite . in the absence of any theoretical control over @xmath0 itself ,",
    "there is a strong temptation to explain the observations by invoking some other mechanism .",
    "some proposals utilise the large number of possible string theory vacua , either by appealing to the anthropic principle @xcite or other quantum effects @xcite , but a more moderate approach is simply to include , among the matter inventory of the universe , some tensile matter with appropriate equation of state whose behaviour is under good control .",
    "this allows us to set @xmath3 by supposing that one or more of the string theory proposals for cancelling @xmath0 applies , and then to exclude the complexities of @xmath0 itself and deal instead with the relatively well - understood properties of matter .",
    "we will argue that , at least in tev - scale models of quintessence , control is not manifest even in this case .",
    "quintessence consists of a scalar field @xmath4 , which drives a late - time accelerated cosmological expansion via its vacuum expectation value in a rather similar way to scalar - field driven inflation .",
    "if @xmath4 is still rolling today then it must be very light in order to satisfy the standard slow - roll conditions and hence its compton wavelength , @xmath5 , is very large ( we denote first , second ,  , @xmath4-derivatives of @xmath6 as @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  , etc . ) as a result it only clusters on very large scales , typically greater than @xmath9 mpc .",
    "this is not necessary . in models involving the albrecht ",
    "skordis potentials , where the dark energy reaches a minimum of the potential at non - zero energy , the mass and expectation value of the quintessence is arbitrary , and so the dark energy may cluster on all scales after reaching the minimum .",
    "such models are attractive for another important reason , for if the quintessence is very light ( it typically has a mass @xmath10 ) , then we must find a way to protect this mass from radiative corrections which will otherwise spoil the flatness of the potential @xcite ( see also , eg .",
    "this has been studied at the one - loop level @xcite .",
    "the result depends on which particle species one includes in the loops .",
    "one typically finds that couplings to bosons are benign @xcite , but couplings to fermions are severely constrained .",
    "the bounds found by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite are extremely stringent and give rise to concern that gravitational couplings alone might be strong enough to violate them .",
    "estimates presented in ref .",
    "@xcite show that quintessence is safe , but this safety is model - dependent and must be assessed carefully .",
    "in addition , @xmath4 must be extremely weakly coupled to standard model fields , otherwise it is difficult to see how it could have evaded detection via particle physics or cosmological interactions . despite their overall weakness , such couplings can alter standard cosmology in an interesting way @xcite , but obtaining them requires significant fine - tuning of the renormalisable couplings .    a more worrying problem is provided by constraints from 4d non - renormalisable couplings between the standard model and the quintessence field .",
    "such couplings are generically expected from supergravity and string theory , and are problematic in ` tracking ' quintessence models which generally have planckian vacuum expection values ( vevs ) .",
    "couplings such as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the usual maxwell lagrangian and @xmath13 is the mass - scale at which we expect supergravity to fail as an effective theory cause variation of the fine - structure constant , and because of the large @xmath4-vev require fine - tuning of the dimensionless coupling @xmath14 of order @xmath15 . since we have no reason to expect @xmath14 to differ significantly from order unity , this unexplained fine - tuning is unsettling .",
    "carroll @xcite has argued that such dimension - five operators may be excluded by the existence of a discrete @xmath16 symmetry in the fundamental description , which acts on the extra dimension as @xmath17 , but even in this case such fine - tuning persists with higher - order operators of the form @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "one of our aims is to consider the effect of such non - renormalisable couplings in models with a low - scale of quantum gravity .",
    "there are many constraints one can consider . despite arising from a variety of different physics ,",
    "these bounds and the constraints on fermion couplings arising from stability of the classical potential share a common feature : they are sensitive to some power of the ratio @xmath19 , where @xmath13 is some energy scale characteristic of the process in question , and @xmath20 is an energy scale which controls the details of heavy physics , which we consider to have been integrated out in our effective description .    in the conventional kind of four - dimensional cosmology one would usually take @xmath20 to be of order the planck mass @xmath21 , although there are other natural candidates :",
    "the gut scale @xmath22 around @xmath23 ; the string scale , possibly a few orders of magnitude less than the planck mass ; or , more speculatively , the susy scale , which may be as low as @xmath24 .",
    "in recent years , inspired by ideas from the strongly coupled limit of the heterotic string @xcite an alternative scenario for cosmology has become popular , in which the various gauge and matter fields which comprise our universe are affixed to a hypersurface in a larger , five - dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "this spacetime is generically a patch of schwarzschild  anti de sitter ( sads ) space . in these models ,",
    "the fundamental scale @xmath25 of quantum gravity might be much lower , perhaps only of order a tev ( @xmath26 ev ) or so , in which case one would expect to obtain very different constraints on quintessence .",
    "( however one should note that in these models , one can not really be dealing with the heterotic string , since in such theories the string scale  which amounts to the quantum gravity scale  is fixed to roughly coincide with the four - dimensional planck scale and there is not much freedom to move it . on the other hand , theories such as type",
    "i string theory can acceptably accommodate a low string scale . ) because the troubling bounds and fine - tunings outlined above depend sensitively on the details of the cutoff scale , one should carefully recalculate the constraints they impose in models with quantum gravity at low energies , but this is not sufficient .",
    "there are other effects which one should also take into account , arising from new physics associated with the branes .",
    "most notably , for example , these models contain a tower of kaluza ",
    "klein modes in addition to a massless four - dimensional graviton .",
    "these kaluza ",
    "klein modes can be considered to arise from gravity in the bulk .",
    "these modes are typically massive , with masses @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the brane hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "the presence of these modes introduces processes , absent in four dimensions , where quintessence can interact with gravity off the brane , or with the kaluza  klein hierarchy .    in this paper",
    ", we apply all these ideas to constrain quintessence couplings and energy scales in tev scale planck mass models .",
    "higher dimensional and brane - world models offer interesting new insights into quintessence cosmology @xcite , but before adopting these models wholesale it is important to consider potential constraints and compare them with the corresponding constraints on 4d quintessence @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the issue of non - renormalisable couplings .",
    "then we briefly review the bounds on quintessence couplings in four dimensions , paying particular attention to bounds on couplings to fermions . in section  [ sec : grav - couple ] we calculate probability amplitudes for some representative gravitational processes , where bulk gravitons mediate quintessence couplings to fermions .",
    "we also estimate the lowest - order contribution of virtual graviton exchange to the vacuum polarization @xmath29 of the quintessence field . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we state our conclusions . in an appendix ,",
    "we give a brief derivation of the gravitational propagator in the brane world , using the fadeev  popov technique .",
    "this has appeared in the literature before @xcite but we present this alternative derivation for simplicity and to make our account self - contained .    throughout we work in units where @xmath30 , but the gravitational coupling in @xmath31 dimensions is @xmath32 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath31-dimensional planck mass .",
    "we use ev as units of dimensionful quantities everywhere .",
    "one of the original motivations for tev - scale quantum gravity was its ability to obviate the need for low - energy supersymmetry by removing the huge hierarchy between the weak and planck scales .",
    "such a low scale for quantum gravity can be achieved rather elegantly in models of large extra dimensions @xcite or in brane - world models with a non - compact extra dimension .",
    "viewed from this perspective , the four - dimensional theory on the brane is simply an effective theory arising from the dimensional reduction of a more fundamental , higher - dimensional theory by integrating out physics at scales above which the extra dimensions become visible . as such",
    ", we must expect our effective four - dimensional theory to be burdened with a potentially infinite number of non - renormalisable interactions , suppressed by powers of the mass scale at which the effective theory breaks down or at which new physics enters the problem . in this case",
    "it is natural to assume the cutoff scale @xmath20 to be the planck scale of the higher - dimensional theory , @xmath33 provided that this is lower than the effective 4d planck scale . above the scale @xmath20",
    "the theory is no longer well - approximated by a four - dimensional theory .    in the discussion that follows",
    "we will leave the cutoff mass scale @xmath20 arbitrary . to minimise clutter ,",
    "we write this scale as @xmath13 . our conclusions are strongest in models where @xmath34 and weaken as @xmath13 increases towards the four dimensional value @xmath35 .",
    "let us begin by considering non - renormalisable lagrangian operators of the form ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is any dimension - four standard - model operator such as @xmath12 or @xmath38 .",
    "we are seeking constraints on the dimensionless coupling @xmath14 , and in particular its dependence on the cut - off scale , as discussed above .",
    "the case @xmath39 leads to cosmic variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath40 @xcite which , assuming slow variation of @xmath4 , gives @xmath41 where @xmath42 ; the symbol @xmath43 abbreviates the field interval @xmath44 ; and @xmath45 denotes redshift . the webb _ et al._results suggest a variation of @xmath40 at the level @xmath46 , ie .",
    "evidence for variation of @xmath40 at the @xmath47 level @xcite .",
    "for @xmath48 the ratio @xmath49 clearly plays a key role .",
    "we have argued that in tev - scale higher dimensional models @xmath13 may be close to the tev scale .",
    "the estimate of the vev @xmath50 is model dependent ; however , we can obtain constraints on standard tracker quintessence models where the dark energy equation of state tracks that of the dominant energy component of the universe until a low redshift @xmath51 .",
    "in such models the quintessence field has been rolling since very early times and it is natural that it has a large vev today , whether the fundamental theory be four- or higher dimensional .",
    "we can get a rough lower - bound on the vev of @xmath4 today by the following argument . to ensure that the universe accelerates , the field @xmath4 must satisfy the standard slow - roll conditions familiar from early universe inflation",
    ". that is , we demand @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . at this point",
    "it is appropriate to comment on the mass scale appearing in @xmath55 and @xmath56 and whether we really should be using the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath25 , or the fundamental scale @xmath13 @xcite . to answer",
    "this one can examine the effective four - dimensional equation of motion for @xmath4 .",
    "slow - roll requires that the potential term @xmath57 be sub - dominant with respect to the friction term coming from the hubble expansion . at least at low energies ,",
    "the effective friedmann equation giving the hubble expansion typically contains @xmath25 , not @xmath13 , and hence the effective four - dimensional scale @xmath25 is the appropriate scale .    to quantify the constraints coming from requiring @xmath52 , consider a standard tracking potential @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the field evolves as @xmath59 and the slow - roll parameter @xmath56 is @xmath60 with a similar constraint arising from @xmath61 .",
    "clearly one can make the vev as small as one likes by fine - tuning the exponent @xmath62 to be sufficiently small but then one loses the attractiveness of the model , since one is simply converging to a cosmological constant .",
    "even then the fine - tuning required is significant . to have @xmath63 with @xmath64 requires @xmath65 .",
    "this is quite undesirable .    with this restriction on the form of the potential in mind ,",
    "let us return to the dimensionless couplings @xmath14 .",
    "if we use the standard result that tracking models typically require vevs of order the 4d planck scale , @xmath66 , then this implies that the ratio @xmath49 can be as large as @xmath67 . matching the webb _",
    "et al._data for @xmath68 is possible with either a fine - tuning of @xmath69 ( the result of @xcite ) or is compatible with @xmath70 by requiring @xmath71 .",
    "such a slow variation of the field is not consistent with the assumption of a rolling quintessence .",
    "however it is consistent with the albrecht ",
    "skordis @xcite model where @xmath4 becomes trapped at the minimum of a potential well .",
    "interestingly , a more detailed analysis shows that the union of constraints on @xmath40 at various redshifts favour very little variation of @xmath4 at low redshifts @xmath72 even when @xmath73 @xcite .    for @xmath74",
    "the situation is much worse , since the large ratio @xmath75 appears .",
    "the required fine - tuning on the dimensionless couplings @xmath76 , or variation @xmath43 , become enormous . for @xmath77",
    "we have @xmath78 , or if we conservatively set @xmath79 we find @xmath80 .",
    "such a coupling is quite inexplicably small .",
    "as @xmath81 increases the fine - tuning on the dimensionless couplings @xmath76 rapidly increases .",
    "of course this simply underlines a more fundamental point : since @xmath82 we have absolutely no control over the effective potential of the quintessence field .",
    "the potential should be computed from the higher - dimensional theory .",
    "this is a standard argument against chaotic inflation which typically requires super - planckian initial conditions to obtain sufficient inflation and the correct amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "of course , one may simply argue that the non - perturbative potential for @xmath4 is completely well - behaved and only gives rise to small couplings to the standard model fields .",
    "this is reminiscent of the runaway dilaton model of quintessence @xcite in which a massless dilaton runs to infinity where it decouples from all matter , as in the proposal of damour & polyakov @xcite . if the quintessence field is a radion , representing the distance between two branes , driven apart , for example , by a repulsive casimir force",
    ", then we expect the @xmath83 limit to be trivial : the potential should vanish .",
    "this occurs because the @xmath4 field dynamics effectively vanish in this limit : it is equivalent to the degenerate case where the branes approach each other . couplings to gauge fields localised on the brane world could also reasonably be expected to vanish in that limit .",
    "however , to appreciate this one requires the full five - dimensional picture , and in other scenarios the corrections may not be so harmless .",
    "in the above analysis , we obtained restrictions on a given set of coupling constants and shape parameters for some popular , rather generic potentials . in doing",
    "so we assumed that the form of the potential could simply be given as an ansatz , so strictly speaking we were dealing with renormalized quantities , and the potential was the quantum effective potential .",
    "a more subtle question is to ask how a given tree - level potential may be modified when quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "this involves the study of loop corrections to the quintessence potential and the couplings of @xmath4 to other fields .    for scalar quintessence and fermions ,",
    "this was first done by doran & jckel @xcite and by horvat @xcite , who considered couplings to neutrinos .",
    "we review their arguments as applied in four dimensions , and explain how this generalizes to the brane world .",
    "many of the bounds described in ref .",
    "@xcite do not depend on the scale of gravity and are not strongly modified in the brane world , so we focus on the gravitational couplings described in ref . @xcite . in particular , we are interested in the coupling of quintessence to fermions , for which the strongest bounds apply .    in the quintessence sector",
    "we work with the euclidean action @xmath84 where @xmath4 is the quintessence field , @xmath85 is its classical potential , @xmath86 is a dirac fermion , and @xmath87 is a possibly @xmath4-dependent fermion mass .",

    "let @xmath88 be given by a large field independent mass @xmath89 plus some correction @xmath90 generated by couplings to other fields .",
    "then the condition that the classical potential dominates becomes @xcite @xmath91 where we have discarded the @xmath90-independent piece @xmath92 which does not affect dynamics , and we are assuming that @xmath93 .",
    "one can estimate @xmath6 @xcite by supposing that @xmath4 currently dominates the energy density of the universe , so that @xmath6 must be comparable to @xmath94 .",
    "setting @xmath0 at around the gut scale @xmath95 , and taking the field - independent fermion mass to be around the supersymmetry breaking scale , perhaps of order a tev , or @xmath96 , that gives @xmath97    this calculation only depends on the details of quantum field theory in the four - dimensional world , so it is valid on the world volume of a brane universe provided that we take the effective cut - off @xmath0 to be sized appropriately . since the bound on @xmath90 scales with @xmath98",
    ", this means that a reduced cut - off will weaken any constraint .",
    "for example , in a model where @xmath0 should be @xmath99 , one finds @xmath100 ev .",
    "this weakening is a mixed blessing .",
    "it is harder to rule out any given quintessence model , but it may make the construction of a viable phenomenological model easier .",
    "this bound eq .  ( [ eq : c - bound ] ) , in brane or four - dimensional form , is rather stringent and could conceivably be violated by gravitational couplings .",

    "this gives the estimate @xmath178 that is , the divergence is linear in the ultra - violet and logarithmic at infra - red .",
    "setting @xmath169 to be currently of order the hubble rate , or @xmath179 ev , and the infra - red cutoff @xmath180 to the same , we find @xmath181 this is very small , and implies that interactions with new gravitational physics associated with the brane world , such as the kaluza  klein hierarchy and graviton transmission through the bulk , do not seriously affect quintessence : its major problems remain its couplings to and interactions with normal matter .",
    "on the other hand , the estimate eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass - shift - estimate ] ) is several orders of magnitude smaller than a comparable estimate for a four - dimensional cosmology with planck scale @xmath182 gev : @xmath183 in this case , there is no infra - red divergence so the magnitude of the effect is controlled by the ultra - violet region .",

    "we have studied the constraints that arise on tev - scale quintessence models from a variety of sources .",
    "non - renormalisable operators in four dimensions are typically important implying that the quintessence potential needs to be computed from a higher - dimensional framework .",

    "in contrast , the gravitational coupling of quintessence to fermionic matter in cosmologies of the randall  sundrum brane world type does not yield significant constraints .",

    "the brane world significantly reduces the value of this cut - off , and so one would expect quite radically different constraints on quintessence .",
    "we find that one - loop effects introduce quantum corrections in the effective potential just proportional to the classical potential @xmath6 and therefore can just be absorbed into a renormalization of @xmath6 .",
    "this is exactly the same as in the four - dimensional world and occurs for the same reason : the vertices in the diagram generate factors of @xmath6 , not the propagator , and since this is the only quantity which changes when one moves to the brane world the type and character of the divergences one encounters changes , but the couplings remain the same .",
    "we have also computed the lowest - order contribution from graviton loops to the vacuum polarization of quintessence . in this case",
    "one must make a numerical estimate , and we find that the brane universe typically induces a mass shift @xmath177 very much smaller than in four dimensions .",
    "this shift is cut - off dependent , and scales with the ratio of the four- and five - dimensional planck scales , the ads curvature scale , and the inverse of the ultra - violet cutoff . from the point of view of an observer on the brane ,",
    "we interpret this as the result of interactions with the kaluza  klein hierarchy and with bulk gravitons .",
