    "measurements of strange particles provide information on the properties of strongly interacting matter at early stages of heavy ion collisions . on the assumption that a deconfinement phase transition occurs in heavy ion collisions",
    ", we have to look for qualitative changes ( onset phenomena ) when varying external parameters like system size and energy density .",
    "therefore , we study @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 production as a function of beam energy and @xmath5 production dependent on the collision centrality .",

    "the spectra deviate from an exponential shape .",

    "from these fits the following inverse slope parameters at 40  @xmath2gev are derived : @xmath9 ( 210@xmath1011 ) mev , @xmath11 ( 218@xmath1039 ) mev . at 40  @xmath2gev the signals of @xmath12 and @xmath13 hyperons",
