    "semi - inclusive hadron production processes become increasingly important for probing hadrons and quark - gluon system properties and for finding a signature beyond the standard model in high - energy hadron reactions . for describing their cross sections ,",
    "there are three ingredients : parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of initial hadrons , intermediate partonic interactions , and fragmentation functions in the final state .",
    "the pdfs have been well investigated in a wide kinematical region with a variety of experimental measurements , and the partonic interactions can be calculated in perturbative qcd ( quantum chromodynamics ) .",
    "however , the fragmentation functions have not been accurately determined as it was typically shown in ref .",
    "namely , there are large uncertainty bands especially in disfavored - quark and gluon functions even in the pion , for which relatively accurate data exist .",
    "moreover , the error bands are large for all the functions in the kaon and nucleon . this fact should be kept in mind for drawing any physics conclusions from experimental measurements of high - energy hadron - production processes @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation functions are obtained by a global analysis of experimental data on the hadron productions @xcite in the similar way to the determination of the pdfs .",
    "although some low moments of the pdfs can be calculated in lattice qcd , it is not possible to calculate the fragmentation functions and their moments due to a specific final state .",
    "there are some hadron models to calculate the fragmentation functions @xcite ; however , they are not accurate enough to calculate precise cross sections for various processes .",
    "therefore , the global analysis of world experimental data is the most reliable way to obtain the accurate fragmentation functions .",
    "furthermore , nuclear modifications of the fragmentation functions are also discussed recently @xcite for understanding heavy - ion reactions and semi - inclusive lepton deep inelastic scattering from nuclei @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation functions have been determined by several groups from analyses of experimental data on hadron productions . until 2013 ,",
    "the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy of the hadron production process @xmath4 ranged mostly from 12 gev to 91.2 gev ; however , many data were taken in the @xmath1 mass region of 91.2 gev at sld ( slac large detector ) and cern - lep ( large electron - positron collider ) .",
    "there were lower - energy data , for example at 12 , 14 , 22 , 29 , 30 , 34 , 44 , and 58 gev ; however , they are taken in a limited kinematical region as shown in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "this fact suggests that significant scaling violation should not be found in the data , which leads to large error bands in gluon fragmentation functions @xcite , whereas the gluon distribution function has been determined in the nucleon by scaling violation data mainly taken at hera ( hadron - electron ring accelerator ) .    in 2013 , there were new experimental developments on the fragmentation functions in the sense that very accurate data were obtained by the belle and babar collaborations for the pion and kaon @xcite at the energies of 10.52 gev and 10.54 gev , respectively .",
    "they are measured in the wide momentum - fraction region which was not covered by the previous measurements .",
    "these @xmath4 experiments were done at the b factories of kek and slac .",
    "it is particularly important that the measurements are at a much lower energy than the @xmath1 mass because the scaling violation becomes clear in the fragmentation functions .",
    "then , the gluon fragmentation functions should be determined more accurately .",
    "it is known that the gluon functions are very important in analyzing hadron production processes especially at rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) and lhc ( large hadron collider ) , where gluons play a major role in the productions .",
    "in addition , the high - statistical b - factory data should be also valuable to obtain precise quark and antiquark fragmentation functions .",
    "these considerations made us to investigate the role of the b - factory data in the determination of the fragmentation functions because our functions are determined in 2007 without these data @xcite .",
    "a purpose of this work is to show how error bands of the fragmentation functions are reduced by adding the b - factory data , as shown in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "in addition , we discuss the details of possible flavor separation and determination of gluon function by taking advantage of accurate measurements in the wide kinematical range between 10.5 gev to 91.2 gev , as explained in sec .",

    "first , a quark - antiquark pair is created by @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ eqn : def - ff ] , where the intermediate state is virtual @xmath15 or @xmath1 .",

    "second , a hadron @xmath18 is created from quark ( @xmath19 ) , antiquark ( @xmath20 ) , or gluon ( @xmath21 ) , and this process is called fragmentation .",

    "( [ eqn : def - ff ] ) is described by the @xmath22-pair creation processes , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with additional higher - order corrections .",

    "[ fig : ee - ff ] as an example ; however , the fragmentation occurs from any primary quarks , antiquarks , and gluons .",

    "( [ eqn : formal - ffs ] ) for the color gauge invariance .",
    "the equation indicates that a specific hadron @xmath18 should be observed in the final state with the momentum fraction @xmath10 .",
    "it suggests that the operator - product - expansion method can not be applied , which is the reason why the fragmentation functions are not evaluated in lattice qcd .",
    "the scaling violation , namely the @xmath2 dependence , of the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) is described by the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) evolution equation .",
    "its general form is the integro - differential equation @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 indicates @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the number of quark flavors , @xmath43 is the running coupling constant of qcd , and the function @xmath44 is time - like splitting function .",
    "one notices that @xmath27 and @xmath45 are interchanged from the space - like dglap equations for the pdfs .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the time - like splitting functions are generally different from the space - like ones if higher - order perturbative corrections are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the actual expressions of @xmath44 are lengthy in the nlo ( next - to - leading - order ) of @xmath46 , so that they should be found , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the evolution equations are complicated integro - differential equations especially if higher - order @xmath46 corrections are included .",

    "various numerical methods have been developed and their references should be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the equations are solved by using the gauss - legendre quadrature for evaluating integrals , and a useful code is provided for calculating the @xmath2 evolution of the fragmentation functions in the leading order ( lo ) and nlo of @xmath46 .",

    "they are parametrized in a simple polynomial form of @xmath10 at a fixed @xmath2 which is denoted as @xmath48 .",

    "a more complicated functional form is usually employed in the pdf analysis ; however , the data variety is enough to probe minute @xmath10 dependence in the ff case . in our analysis ,",
    "the initial scale @xmath48 is taken as @xmath53 gev@xmath54 for gluon and light quarks ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , and it is taken at the masses @xmath58 and @xmath59 for charm and bottom quark ffs .",
    "the second moments of the ffs are defined by @xmath60 and they are related to the overall constants @xmath50 with the beta function as @xmath61 . since there is a sum rule for the second moments : @xmath62 , it is more appropriate to use the parameter set ( @xmath63 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) in the global analysis , rather than the set ( @xmath64 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) in order to exclude an unphysical solution with a sum which significantly exceeds one even by the summation over @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    in general ,",
    "different parameters are assigned for favored and disfavored ffs , separately .",
    "the favored means the fragmentation from a quark which exits in the hadron @xmath18 as a constituent in the naive su(6 ) quark model , whereas the disfavored means the fragmentation from a sea quark .",
    "although it is known that light sea - quark ( up , down , strange sea quarks ) distributions are not flavor symmetric in the unpolarized pdfs @xcite , they are assumed to be the same in the present analysis of the ffs .",

    "<S> fragmentation functions are determined for the pion and kaon by global analyses of charged - hadron production data in electron - positron annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> accurate measurements were reported by the belle and babar collaborations for the fragmentation functions at the center - of - mass energies of 10.52 gev and 10.54 gev , respectively , at the kek and slac b factories , whereas other available @xmath0 measurements were mostly done at higher energies , mainly at the @xmath1 mass of 91.2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> there is a possibility that gluon fragmentation functions , as well as quark fragmentation functions , are accurately determined by scaling violation . </S>",
    "<S> we report our global analysis of the fragmentation functions especially to show impacts of the b - factory measurements on the fragmentation function determination . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the fragmentation functions are determined more accurately not only by the scaling violation but also by high - statistical nature of the belle and babar data . however , there are some tensions between the belle and babar data in comparison with previous measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we also explain how the flavor dependence of quark fragmentation functions and the gluon function are separated by using measurements at different @xmath2 values . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the electric and weak charges are different depending on the quark type , so that a light - quark flavor separation also became possible in principle due to the precise data at both @xmath3 gev and 91.2 gev . </S>"
