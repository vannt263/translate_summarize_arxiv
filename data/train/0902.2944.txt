    "the monte carlo hamiltonian has been suggested 1999  @xcite . in field theory , the monte carlo hamiltonian has been applied to the @xmath6 klein - gordon model for the computation of the spectrum and thermodynamical functions  @xcite , and likewise to the @xmath6 scalar model for the computation of the spectrum and thermodynamical functions  @xcite .",

    "the eigenvalue of the electric field @xmath50 corresponds to the contribution from @xmath41 plaquette loops ( on top of each other ) .",
    "the result only depends on the number of plaquette loops and the difference between initial and final plaquette angles .",
    "a. _ electric hamiltonian_. in order to test the monte carlo hamiltonian , we first consider the electric part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is a good test bed , because the spectrum of the electric hamiltonian can be computed analytically .",
    "fig.[[fig : scalingcompareelec+fullham]](left ) shows the low - lying part of the spectrum as function of the time parameter @xmath51 occuring in the matrix elements .",
    "the physical spectrum should be independent of the time parameter . in the numerical results",
    "this is reflected by the existence of scaling windows ( region of flat line ) .",
    "the size of such scaling window depends on the particular energy - level and decreases with increasing energy .",
    "we found that the size of the scaling window @xmath52 can be described approximately by an exponential law @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "such behavior of decreasing scaling windows can be understood from the property that @xmath54 $ ] projects onto the ground state for large @xmath38 ( feynman - kac theorem ) .",
    "higher levels become exponentially suppressed by the dominant ground state and can survive only for short times @xmath38 .",
    "we looked also for scaling windows in the corresponding wave functions .",
    "in particular , we have studied @xmath55 , i.e. the expansion coefficient of wave function @xmath56 in terms of the stochastic basis function @xmath57 .",
    "such expansion coefficients for the first energy levels expanded in terms of the first basis function also display scaling windows ( not shown ) .",
    "like the size of the energy scaling window decreases with increasing energy @xmath58 , also the size of the wave function scaling window decreases with the level index @xmath41 of energy .    for the case of low - lying spectrum using a lattice of size @xmath8 a comparison of results from the monte carlo hamiltonian with the exact spectrum is shown in fig.[[fig : spec4 + 9 + 100plaq]](left ) .",
    "the high degeneracy is due to 1- and 2-plaquette states located anywhere on the @xmath8 lattice ( such degeneracy will be lifted when taking the magnetic term into account ) .",
    "the figure shows , firstly , that the monte carlo hamiltonian captures almost all of the degenerate states and secondly , reproduces the exact energies with small error .",
    "the quality of the energy spectrum of the monte carlo hamiltonian can be seen also from a look at thermodynamical functions . in the case of the electric hamiltonian",
    ", the energy spectrum @xmath59 can be computed analytically .",
    "thermodynamical functions can be expressed via those energies .",
    "we have computed average energy , free energy , entropy and specific heat , and compared the results from the monte carlo hamiltonian with the exact one .",
    "the result for the specific heat is displayed in fig.[[fig : spec4 + 9 + 100plaq]](right ) .",
    "in general , one observes very good agreement in the regime of large @xmath60 , i.e. , the low temperature regime . for small values of @xmath60",
    "some disagreement becomes visible , reflecting the fact that the precision of higher enegy levels of the monte carlo hamiltonian is limited ( their scaling windows go to zero ) .",
    "+ b. _ including the magnetic term : full hamiltonian_. finally , we consider the gauge invariant transition amplitude under the full hamiltonian ( eq.[eq : transamplupsilon ] ) . although it can be expressed in terms of a path integral with the lattice action ( wilson action ) , this is numerically not suitable , because monte carlo with importance sampling only allows to compute ratios of transition amplitudes .",
    "hence , we factorize the above amplitude into two terms , one being analytically computable and the other one being given by the ratio of transition amplitudes computable via monte carlo , @xmath61 | u_{\\nu } \\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\frac { \\langle u_{\\mu } |\\hat{\\pi } ~ \\exp[-h t/\\hbar ] | u_{\\nu } \\rangle } { \\langle u_{\\mu } |\\hat{\\pi } ~ \\exp[-h_{elec } t/\\hbar ] | u_{\\nu } \\rangle } ~ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking into account the magnetic term allows to obtain the full monte carlo hamiltonian .",
    "first results on scaling of its low - lying energy spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "[ [ fig : scalingcompareelec+fullham]](right ) .",
    "these results correspond to a small lattice ( @xmath9 ) and also a small number of basis functions .",
    "the results show scaling windows for the lowest five energy levels .",
    "compared to the scaling behavior observed in the electric hamiltonian ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig : scalingcompareelec+fullham ] ]  left ) fewer levels show scaling , and the scaling windows are smaller .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the ratio of matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrixelemgauge ] ) has been determined via monte carlo from path integrals , which carries statistical errors in the order of a few percent . from this observation",
    "we conclude that the numerical resolution of energy levels and the size of scaling windows of the full hamiltonian is essentially determined by the statistical error occuring in the numerical calculation of the ratio of matrix elements .",
