    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) of elliptical galaxies is thought to be considered to be an accumulation of stellar mass loss and supernova ejecta .",
    "while standard supernova rates predict the ism to have a high metallicity of several times the solar value ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , the observed ism metallicity in fact fell below half a solar , even lower than the stellar metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this strong discrepancy calls into question our current understanding of supernova enrichment and chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "ngc 4636 is one of the relatively isolated yet most luminous elliptical galaxies , both in optical ( @xmath7=@xmath8 assuming a distance of 17 mpc ) and in x - ray ( @xmath9= 3.8@xmath10 ; _ einstein _  ) band ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . using rosat , trinchieri et al .",
    "( 1994 ) discovered a very extended x - ray emission surrounding this galaxy , out to @xmath11 .",
    "the first asca observation of ngc 4636 in the pv ( performance verification ) phase yielded the very low ism metallicity ( @xcite ) , together with abundance and temperature gradients ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have re - observed ngc 4636 with asca ( @xcite ) for an extremely long time ; over 200 ks .",
    "this has allowed matsushita ( 1997 ) to perform a much deeper study of the extended x - ray component after rosat . in this paper",
    ", we utilize the overall asca data including this long exposure , to study the spectral properties of ngc 4636 and look into the abundance problem .",
    "ngc 4636 has been observed from asca twice . following the pv observation ( 1993 july 22 , with the sis in 4ccd mode ) , the second much longer observation was conducted in the ao-4 phase from 1995 december 28 through 1996 january 4 , with the sis in the 1ccd mode .",
    "we discarded the data taken under cut - off rigidities less than 6 gev c@xmath12 , or elevation angle less than @xmath13 and @xmath14 from night and day earth respectively .",
    "this has yielded exposure times of 36 ks ( with the gis ) and 39 ks ( with the sis ) for the pv observation , and those for the ao-4 observation are 172 ks ( gis ) and 215 ks ( sis ) .",
    "we accumulated on - source spectra within 4 times the effective radius , @xmath15 ( @xcite ) , centered on ngc  4636 .",
    "since the sis response has changed with time , we treat the sis spectra from the two observations separately .",
    "the background spectrum was obtained by integrating the blank - sky data over the same region of the detector .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the background - subtracted sis spectrum for the ao-4 data .",
    "we jointly fit the two sis ( pv and ao-4 ) spectra and one gis spectrum , with a standard two component model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the model consists of a thin thermal emission from the ism with free temperature @xmath16 and free metallicity , and a thermal bremsstrahlung   with temperature fixed at 10 kev representing the contribution from low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "both components are subjected to a common interstellar absorption @xmath17 .",
    "although the gis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is less sensitive than the sis to the low - energy ( e.g. @xmath18 1 kev ) atomic lines , it can constrain the hard component better than the sis , and is fully sensitive to the si - k and s - k lines . therefore",
    ", the joint use of the two instruments is essential . in this paper",
    "we adopt for the solar iron abundance the ` meteoritic ' value , fe / h@xmath19 by number ( @xcite )      as the first - cut spectral analysis , we represented the ism component by the plasma emission model of raymond & smith ( 1977 ; hereafter r - s model ) with solar abundance ratios .",
    "the best - fit model parameters turned out to be consistent with those of awaki et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but the fit was totally unacceptable ( table 1 ) .",
    "we then allowed the abundances to deviate from the solar ratios , by dividing heavy elements into two groups to estimate relative contributions from type ia and type ii supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "one group consists of so - called @xmath1-elements , o , ne , mg , si and s , which are assumed to have a common abundance @xmath20 .",
    "the other group includes fe and ni , with a common abundance @xmath21 .",
    "abundance of he is fixed to be 1 solar .",
    "the abundances of the other elements are assumed to be the same as @xmath1-elements , although their effect on @xmath22 kev spectrum is negligible .",
    "the fit incorporating 6 parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath21 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and two normalizations ) still remained far from acceptable , as shown in table 1 .",
    "we further replaced the r - s model with meka model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , mekal model ( @xcite ) , or masai model ( @xcite ) , but none of them were successful .",
    "multi - temperature ism models did not improve the fit , either .    in these fits ,",
    "the data - to - model discrepancy is always largest around the fe - l complex region ( 0.8 @xmath24 kev ) .",
    "in addition , the fit residuals and the derived physical quantities both depend significantly on the plasma emission codes .",
    "these reconfirm the serious problems in the theoretical fe - l line modeling , as pointed out by fabian et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and arimoto et al .",
    "furthermore , we have found strong false couplings between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , arising from the following two effects . on one hand ,",
    "the fitting algorithm tries to reduce the fe - l discrepancy , by adjusting intensities of the o - k and ne - k lines which overlap the fe - l complex ; this strongly affects @xmath20 , since the data have the highest statistics in this energy range . in turn",
    "@xmath20 affects @xmath25 , because the bound - free emission from oxygen and neon acts nearly as a continuum to the fe - l lines and controls their equivalent widths .",
    "these effects make both @xmath21   and @xmath23   highly unreliable .      in order to avoid these problems",
    ", we tentatively restricted the energy range for the sis spectral fit to @xmath26 kev which is unaffected by the fe - l , o - k and ne - k lines .",
    "for the gis spectrum , we used an energy range above 1.6 kev , because of its poorer energy resolution . we re - arranged heavy elements into 4 groups ; mg ; si ; s ; and other elements including o , ne , fe and ni ( hereafter @xmath27 ) .",
    "elements in the last group contribute to the @xmath28 kev spectrum mainly via free - bound continua ( fe - k and ni - k lines are undetectable ) .",
    "then , the fit has become acceptable with the reduced @xmath29 of 1.06 for 220 dof .. the derived temperature , 0.73 kev ( 0.670.76 kev with 90% confidence for a single parameter ) , agrees with those derived using the whole energy range .",
    "we have further found that the mg to si abundance ratio always agrees with the solar ratio ( fig.2 ) , even though their abundances correlate considerably with @xmath27 .",
    "the s abundance may be similar , or slightly higher by about 30 % .",
    "on the other hand , the stellar and supernova nucleosysnthesis predicts o , ne and mg to follow the solar abundance ratios ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that all the @xmath1-elements ( o , ne , mg , si and s ) have the same abundance in solar units .",
    "we can now safely return to the original element grouping into @xmath23   and @xmath21 , and refit the spectra above 1.6 kev ( sis ) and 1.7 kev ( gis ) .",
    "the fit is acceptable with the reduced @xmath29 of 1.06 for 210 dof . ,",
    "and the derived temperature is 0.75 ( 0.720.78 ) kev .",
    "now , @xmath23   is determined relatively well ( fig.3 ) , because it relies upon the si - k and s - k lines instead of using the unreliable o - k and ne - k lines that are now ignored .",
    "unlike the full - range fit , @xmath23   depends on @xmath21   only weakly through fe contribution to the free - bound continuum .",
    "these results unambiguously show that @xmath23   is roughly one solar , unless @xmath21   is extremely high .",
    "our next task is to better constrain @xmath25 .",
    "this requires us to utilize the fe - l line information , but simply reviving the energy range below 1.6 kev would bring us back to the original problems described in  3.1 . in order to relax the too strong constraints imposed by the data in the fe - l region , we have decided to assign 20% systematic errors to each spectral data in the 0.41.6 kev range .",
    "this is because the data - to - model discrepancy and the model - to - model differences are both @xmath30 20 % around the fe - l region ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have thus fitted the sis / gis spectra jointly with the two - component model , incorporating the increased systematic error and again employing the element grouping into @xmath23   and @xmath25 .",
    "the fit is acceptable with either of the plasma models ( table 1 ) , and the confidence regions on the @xmath23   vs. @xmath21   plane for different plasma emission codes have come to a similar region ( fig.3 ) . as a consequence",
    ", we can now conclude with confidence that @xmath23   and @xmath21   are both consistent with @xmath30 1 solar , within a factor of 2 .",
    "in addition , the ratio between @xmath23   to @xmath21   coincides with the solar ratio within @xmath31% .      in order to study the metal distribution",
    ", we accumulated the gis and sis spectra in three concentric annular regions with radius range , 04@xmath32 , 4@xmath328@xmath32 , and 8@xmath3212@xmath32 centered on the galaxy .",
    "we assume that the ism is spherically symmetric .",
    "this `` ring - sorted analysis '' is however limited by the spectral mixing effect among different sky regions , due to the extended point - spread - function of the asca x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) .",
    "this tends to smear out any radial gradient in the ism properties . following the analysis in  3.3 ,",
    "we include 20% systematic error in the 0.4 - 1.6 kev data .",
    "we fit only with the r - s model , since the difference due to plasma emission code is only several tens of % after inclusion of the systematic error .",
    "an acceptable fit is obtained in all three regions ( table 2 ) .    as shown in table 2 and fig.4 ,",
    "the derived @xmath23   and @xmath21   are @xmath2 1 solar within @xmath33 , and drop to @xmath34 solar at @xmath35 .",
    "this confirms the existence of strong abundance gradient in the ism in ngc 4636 , and reveals that both @xmath1-elements and fe equally show the abundance gradient .",
    "their ratio is close to the solar value at all radii .",
    "the absolute values of the abundances are higher than those derived in mushotzky et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who assumed a solar ratio in the metals , but the temperatures and hydrogen column densities are consistent .",
    "by carefully examining the abundance ratios and uncertainties in the fe - l complex , we have concluded that the ism abundances of fe and @xmath1-elements in the x - ray luminous galaxy , ngc 4636 , are in fact as high as about 1 solar within @xmath33 .",
    "the abundance ratio between @xmath23   and @xmath21   is very close to the solar ratio within @xmath31% .",
    "this means that both type ia and type ii sne ejecta make significant contribution in the ism .",
    "the ism iron abundance is expected to be given by @xmath36 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , where @xmath37 is the average iron abundance of the stars in units of the solar abundance , @xmath38 the hubble constant in units of 50 km s@xmath39 , @xmath40 is the present rate of sn ia in ellipticals in units of the rate as estimated by tammann ( 1982 ) , and @xmath41 is the iron yield per sn ia event . the stellar fe abundance , @xmath37 , averaged over the whole galaxy is 0.74 solar ( @xcite ) . since our revised value of @xmath21   is fairly close to these stellar values ,",
    "the previously - quoted severe problem that the ism abundance was lower than the stellar metallicity has been mostly removed .",
    "we can solve for the relative contribution from sn ia and sn ii on @xmath1-elements and fe .",
    "if we assume that sn ii products have 3 times higher value of @xmath23   than @xmath21   ( @xcite ) and sn ia produces only fe , the sn ii contribution necessary to produce the observed @xmath23   ( 1 solar ) can enrich fe to @xmath21   = 1/3 solar .",
    "the rest of @xmath21 , i.e. 2/3 of the best - fit fe abundance , has to be explained by sn ia . using equation ( 1 )",
    ", we can estimate the sn ia rate @xmath42 . in order to derive an upper limit for @xmath42 ,",
    "let us assume that stars contain no fe from sn ia .",
    "this gives an equation only for the sn ia contribution , @xmath43 .",
    "the left hand side is now estimated to be @xmath2 0.7 solar , so that the condition for @xmath42 is @xmath44 . therefore , the present abundance result suggests that sn ia rate would be less than 1/7 of tammann s rate for @xmath45 . considering the uncertainties in @xmath23  and @xmath21 ,",
    "this is consistent with the recent estimation of @xmath46 by capperallo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) based on the supernova counting .",
    "a systematic study of the ism abundance involving many galaxies would be neccessary to further look into this problem . also , fe - l diagnostics need to be closely examined in order to reach consistent answers among the models ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have confirmed and refined the strong abundance gradient feature in the ism discovered by mushotzky et al .",
    "in addition , we have for the first time discovered strong abundance gradient in @xmath1-elements , which is very similar to that of @xmath21 .",
    "there may be an internal metallicity gradient in the ism within the galaxy , as suggested from the significant gradient in the stellar metallicity within @xmath47 ( @xcite ) . however , no information is available about the stellar metallicity in larger scales .",
    "there exists an extended x - ray emission around ngc  4636 with a radius @xmath48 100 kpc , as discovered by trinchieri et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and confirmed with asca , by matsushita ( 1997 ) . since the hot gas responsible for the extended emission has a very low metallicity as seen in the data in r=812@xmath32 , the abundance gradient can be explained in terms of the growing contribution from the metal poor gas in the outer region .",
    "the similarity in the slope of of @xmath23   and @xmath21   gradient suggests common dilution due to external gas .",
