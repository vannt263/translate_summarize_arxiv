    "<S> the squeeze - out flow in reactions of @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn and @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba at different incident energies for different impact parameters is investigated by means of an isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics model . </S>",

    "<S> this isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow is shown to mainly result from the isospin dependence of nucleon - nucleon cross section and the symmetry energy .    </S>",

    "<S> n - n _ cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the squeeze - out flow@xcite is of special interest since it comes from the only direction where the nuclear matter might escape without being hindered by the presence of the cold spectator remnants and thus a less disturbed information on the matter of high density and temperature is expected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is very significant to explore isospin effects on the squeeze - out flow .    in this short note </S>",
    "<S> we report results of the first theoretical study on the squeeze - out flow from reactions of @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn and @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba at different energies for different impact parameters within the framework of an isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( idqmd ) model which includes the symmetry energy , coulomb interaction , isospin - dependent experimental @xmath1-@xmath1 cross sections , and particularly the isospin - dependent pauli blocking@xcite . in the initialization process of the idqmd model , </S>",
    "<S> the neutron and proton are distinguished from each other and meanwhile the nonphysical rotations in the initialized nuclei have been removed@xcite . in the idqmd model , the nuclear mean field can be parameterized by @xmath2 with @xmath3 the normal nuclear matter density ( here is 0.16 @xmath4 ) ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the total , neutron , and proton interaction densities , respectively ; @xmath8 is the @xmath9th component of the isospin degree of freedom , which equals @xmath10 or @xmath11 for neutrons or protons , respectively ; @xmath12 is the symmetry strength ; @xmath13 is the coulomb potential ; and @xmath14 is the finite range yukawa ( surface ) potential which will vanish for infinite nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the forms and parameters of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqmf ] ) can be found in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idqmd is different from the so - called iqmd ( isospin - qmd ) model@xcite by the pauli blocking , the initialization process , and construction of fragment . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been used recently to explain successfully several phenomena in hic s at intermediate energies , which depend on the isospin of the reaction system@xcite . in the present calculations , the so - called soft eos with an incompressibility of @xmath15 mev </S>",

    "<S> , the reaction plane is known @xmath17 and it is defined as the @xmath18-@xmath9 plane ( @xmath9-axis corresponds to the beam direction ) . the azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane can be written as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the @xmath18- and @xmath22-components of nucleon momentum in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system . </S>",
    "<S> many studies have shown that the azimuthal distribution in hic s can be fitted well by the legendre polynomial up to the second order@xcite , i.e. ,    @xmath23    the coefficient @xmath24 represents the strength of the in - plane directed flow while a positive @xmath25 reflects the strength of the rotational collective motion ( the azimuthal distribution peaks at @xmath26 and @xmath27 simultaneously ) and negative one ( the azimuthal distribution peaks at @xmath28 @xmath29 ) the out - of - plane squeeze - out . for the mid - rapidity azimuthal distribution , the ratio @xmath30 ,    @xmath31    measures the strength of the squeeze - out flow in a quantitative way . </S>",
    "<S> a value @xmath32 corresponds to a preferential out - of - plane emission . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that @xmath30 depends on the transverse momenta of nucleons@xcite and in the present study the normalized nucleon transverse momentum @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the transverse momenta of nucleon and the projectile momentum in the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> system , respectively ) is limited to @xmath36 for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the mid - rapidity is defined as a narrow region around the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> rapidity by applying the condition @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the reduced c.m . rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been shown that @xmath30 depends on the fragment mass@xcite and in this work the calculated results are obtained from all nucleons entering the analysis to accumulate the numerical statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 displays the idqmd model prediction of @xmath30 as a function of incident energy for reactions of @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn and @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba at impact parameter @xmath39=4 fm . </S>",
    "<S> the errors shown are the statistical errors resulting from the legendre polynomial fits . </S>",
    "<S> it is indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that the @xmath30 value increases with increment of the incident energy and then saturate or decrease at higher incident energies , which is in agreement with the recent experimental results@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the @xmath30 value at higher incident energies is easy to understand by the shadowing effects of the cold nuclear matter surrounding the participant zone which decrease because the projectile spectators escape faster . a more interesting feature in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 is that the more neutron - rich system @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn displays systematically smaller @xmath30 values than the system @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba , which implies that there exists a strong isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow , namely , the more neutron - rich system displays weaker squeeze - out flow . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , one can find that the isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow decreases as the incident energy increases , which may be due to the fact that the isospin dependence of the _ n - n _ cross section disappears at higher incident energies .    in order to investigate further the isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow , we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 the ratio @xmath30 as a function of impact parameter for reactions of @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn and @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba at 350 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the errors shown are the statistical errors resulting from the legendre polynomial fits . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a strong isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow is observed once again , namely , the more neutron - rich system @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn displays systematically smaller @xmath30 values than the system @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba at different impact parameters . in particular , this isospin dependence is more pronounced in semi - central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is indicated that the largest @xmath30 value is obtained at @xmath39=6 fm , i.e. , in semi - central collisions , which is in good agreement with the recent experiment where a maximum of @xmath30 located at about @xmath39=6 fm has been evidenced in reaction of au+au at 400 mev / nucleon@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can be explained by an expansion shadowing scenario@xcite where the expansion of the participant matter is rescattered by the cold target or projectile spectator .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to investigate the influence of the symmetry energy and isospin - dependent _ n - n _ cross section on the squeeze - out flow since the isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow may result from the competition among several mechanisms in the isospin - dependent reaction dynamics , such as the symmetry energy , isospin - dependent _ n - n _ cross sections , and so on .    using different symmetry energy strength @xmath12 and parametrizations of _ </S>",

    "<S> meanwhile , the results of legendre polynomial fits according to eq . ( [ eqleg ] ) for @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn ( solid line ) and @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba ( dashed line ) as well as the resulting @xmath24 and @xmath25 are also included in fig . </S>",

    "<S> n - n _ cross section @xmath42 which is isospin dependent . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( b ) we use @xmath43 ( no symmetry energy ) and @xmath42 . the case of using @xmath16 mev and cugnon s </S>",
    "<S> _ n - n _ cross section @xmath44 which is isospin independent , is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( c ) .    one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 that the azimuthal distribution exists minima at @xmath26 and @xmath45 ( i.e. , in the in - plane @xmath20-direction ) and maxima at @xmath28 @xmath29 ( i.e. , in out - of - plane @xmath21-direction which is perpendicular to the reaction plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> these features imply that at mid - rapidity more nucleons are squeezed out perpendicular to the reaction plane than in the reaction plane . in order to see more clearly the isospin effects on the squeeze - out flow , we give in table 1 the @xmath30 values extracted from @xmath25 in fig . 3 for different cases . </S>",
    "<S> the errors shown are the statistical errors resulting from the legendre polynomial fits . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from table 1 that both the symmetry energy and the isospin - dependent _ n - n _ cross section enhance the strength of the squeeze - out flow but the latter enhances it more strongly . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , it is indicated that the influence of @xmath42 on system @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba is stronger than that on the system @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn , which is easy to understand since the neutron - proton cross section is about three times larger than the neutron - neutron or proton - proton cross section for @xmath42 at energy of about 350 mev / nucleon , which results in more _ </S>",
    "<S> n - n </S>",
    "<S> _ collisions for @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry energy is generally repulsive and the change of symmetry strength @xmath12 might modify the equation of state and thus the squeeze - out flow . from above analysis , one can conclude that the isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow seems to mainly result from the isospin dependence of _ n - n _ cross section and the symmetry potential has less influence on it . in above calculations , only the free - space _ </S>",
    "<S> n - n _ cross sections are adopted and the in - medium effect is only simulated by the pauli blocking . however , the in - medium _ </S>",
    "<S> n - n _ cross sections and their isospin dependence might be strongly density dependent@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow may provide a unique opportunity to study the isospin dependent in - medium _ </S>",
    "<S> n - n _ cross sections .    in summary , by using the idqmd model , we studied for the first time the out - of - plane squeeze - out flow in reactions of @xmath0sn + @xmath0sn and @xmath0ba + @xmath0ba </S>",
    "<S> . a strong isospin dependence of squeeze - out flow has been found , namely , the more neutron - rich system exhibits weaker squeeze - out flow , which is shown to mainly result from the isospin dependence of _ n - n _ cross section and the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , it is indicated that the squeeze - out flow depends strongly on the impact parameter and incident energy . </S>",
    "<S> our study proposes that one can investigate the isospin - dependent reaction dynamics by studying the isospin effects on the azimuthal distribution and suggests that the isospin dependence of the squeeze - out flow could be as a probe of the isospin - dependent in - medium _ </S>",
