    "an important prediction of quantum field theory is the existence of quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields even in vacuum .",
    "these quantum fluctuations lead to a number of observable effects such as the lamb shift , and the casimir and casimir - polder forces ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "all these effects have been observed experimentally .",
    "the casimir - polder force was originally studied between a neutral electric polarizable atom at rest and a conducting plane in vacuum by casimir and polder @xcite , and later a variety of situations have been considered , for example , the case of an atom near the surface of a dielectric slab @xcite or a nanostructure @xcite , and the case of the atom - surface system in or out of thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in addition , the case of atoms on accelerated trajectories has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "our interest in the casimir - polder force associated with accelerated atoms is two - fold .",
    "first , such studies may shed some light on our understanding of the unruh effect  @xcite , on which controversy still exists  @xcite , and , second , the cp force of an accelerated atom , which arises as a result of the change of atomic energy level shifts , may provide a new possibility to detect the unruh effect .    in this regard ,",
    "let us note that the casimir - polder interaction energy between an accelerated atom in interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic fields and an infinite conducting plane boundary , which is equal to the energy shift of the atom caused by the presence of the boundary , has recently been studied , and it is found that the effect of acceleration is not purely thermal  @xcite . in that work ,",
    "a generalization of the formalism suggested by dalibard , dupont - roc and cohen - tannoudji  @xcite(ddc ) , which allows a separate calculation of contributions of vacuum fluctuation and radiation reaction to the energy level shift is employed , and the result is however expressed as an integral of a very complicated function which makes it hard both for analytical examination of the behavior of the level shifts in different distance regimes and for numerical analysis . in the present paper ,",
    "we plan to revisit the problem .",
    "we have been able to obtain a result of the energy level shift of the accelerated atom , which is almost in a closed form except for a part which is a integral of a much simpler function .",
    "this enables us to make a thorough comparison , in different distance regimes , with the result of the case of a static atom in a thermal bath found by us using the same formalism  @xcite to see whether the accelerated atom behaves as if immersed in a thermal bath in terms of atomic energy level shifts  .",
    "more importantly , the numerical analysis of our result at an acceleration of the transition frequency of the atom yields conclusions that differ from those obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for example , we find , contrary to the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the energy level shift of an atom with an acceleration of the typical transition frequency in the vicinity of an infinite conducting plane is smaller than that of a static one when the distance is at the order of @xmath0 m , among others .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in sec .",
    "ii , using the ddc formalism , we separately calculate both the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the position dependent energy shifts of an atom on a uniformly accelerated trajectory , which gives rise to the casimir - polder force on the accelerated atom . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze in detail the behavior of the energy shift of a ground - state atom in three different regimes of the distance in both the low acceleration and high acceleration limits .",
    "in addition , with the method of numerical analysis , we also discuss the behavior of the energy shift for an atom with a typical acceleration necessary to observe the unruh effect . comparing our results with those of a static atom immersed in a thermal bath",
    ", we can see explicitly the difference between the energy shift of an accelerated atom and that of a thermal one .",
    "finally , we will conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a summary of results obtained .",
    "we consider a uniformly accelerated two - level atom in interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic fields in a flat spacetime with an infinite conducting plane boundary .",
    "let us note that for a fully realistic treatment , one may need to consider a multilevel atom . using the ddc formalism and following the procedures that have been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , we will calculate separately the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the energy shifts of a two - level atom .",

    "one can write down the heisenberg equations of motion for the dynamical variables of the atom and field . the solutions of the equations of motion can be split into the two parts : a free part , which is present even in the absence of the coupling , and which we will denote with the superscript @xmath1 , and a source part , which is caused by the interaction of the atom and field , and which we will denote with the superscript @xmath2 .",
