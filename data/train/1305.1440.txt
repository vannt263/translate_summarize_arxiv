    "a prominent feature of phase transitions in correlated electron systems is the nanoscale dynamics leading to future electronics such as switching devices and novel nonvolatile resistance - change memory applications @xcite . in spite of the long - standing research ,",
    "device prototypes remain limited mainly due to the absence of a method for a continuous ( _ i.e. _ , paraelectrical ) and precise electrostatic control ( gating ) of a two dimensional ( 2d ) charge carrier density @xmath710@xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , oxygen and cation stoichiometry are fairly unstable in perovskite - type ( abo@xmath4 ) transition - metal oxides ( tmos ) @xcite .",
    "deposition of dielectric oxides on the surface of abo@xmath4 channel for gating inevitably results in such kind of defects , introducing randomness and eventually smearing the critical features of metal - insulator transitions @xcite . in the face of these challenges , we have chosen to fabricate fet adopting single - crystalline srtio@xmath4  for the channel .     ( a ) photograph of a typical fet structure fabricated on the top of a ( 100 ) surface of a single - crystalline srtio@xmath4 . gate ( g ) , source ( s ) , drain ( d ) electrodes and four other potential probes such as v@xmath8 and v@xmath2 are indicated .",

    "( d ) field - effect ( fe ) mobility plotted against the sheet carrier density for samples a , b , c , and d with different parylene - c  thickness as summarised in table  [ table1 ] . ]    this compound is a band insulator with a crystal structure characteristic of many tmo mott insulators , and becomes metallic by electron doping .",
    "srtio@xmath4  is an n - type wide - gap semiconductor with a band gap of 3.2ev .",
    "it is considered as a matrix for spintronic devices due to the unique configuration of the spin - precession vector at the surface and the absence of the dresselhaus term @xcite .",
    "the surface of the single crystal can be atomically flat and is widely used as a substrate for correlated tmo thin films , making it preferable candidate to test the suitability of the reported gate insulator for future electronics . identifying the technical methods and physical mechanism for paraelectric tuning of electronic conduction in two dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) created at the surface of srtio@xmath4  is a problem of bursting interdisciplinary interest @xcite .",
    "high - density charge accumulation @xmath5@xmath10@xmath1 was recently realised @xcite through an electric double - layer ( edl ) on the surface of electrolytes such as ionic liquids .",
    "although the gating with edl is a promising method for future correlated electron devices , its viability is hindered , because ionic liquids on the surface of tmos may trigger redox reactions , causing vacancies at the interface especially in the presence of high electric fields @xcite .",
    "in addition , the continuous control of the carrier density with edl can be done only by using liquid electrolytes , which are unsuitable for integration to the present solid - state electronics .    .",
    "[ table1 ] parylene - c  thickness of the four different samples reported in this work .",
    "the values of thickness were estimated from the measured values of capacitance of the bilayer gate insulators . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     here , we have engineered a bilayer of poly - monochloro-_para_-xylylene ( known as parylene - c ) @xcite with ta@xmath2o@xmath3 , fig .",
    "[ images ] .",
    "ta@xmath2o@xmath3  has a high dielectric constant @xmath11=25 and a relatively high dielectric strength @xmath54mv / cm @xcite . the combination of ta@xmath2o@xmath3  and parylene - c  into a single gate insulator enabled a sheet carrier density of @xmath510@xmath0@xmath1 while keeping the field effect mobility of the srtio@xmath4  surface at @xmath510@xmath12/vs .",
    "fabrication details can be found in the methods summary .",
    "the electronic transport measurements were performed using an agilent 4155c semiconductor parameter analyser .",
    "[ images](c ) shows the gate leak currents plotted against the sheet carrier density for the bilayer gate insulator and for the single parylene - c  gate insulator .",
    "although the total thickness of the bilayer gate insulator is 10 times thinner than the 3@xmath9m - thick parylene - c , the leak current of the bilayer is an order of magnitude lower , which is similar to the trend reported earlier @xcite .",
    "hence , the sputtering deposition of ta@xmath2o@xmath3  does not damage the parylene - c  thin film .",
    "[ images](d ) depicts an upturn in the increase of the field effect mobility at sheet carrier densities @xmath13@xmath1 .",
    "the field effect mobility is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the sheet conductance and @xmath16 is the nominal sheet carrier density in the channel region .",
    "@xmath17 is the channel current , @xmath18 ( and @xmath19 ) is the distance ( and voltage difference ) between channel electrodes v@xmath2 and v@xmath8 , @xmath20 is the channel width , @xmath21 is the measured total capacitance per unit area , and @xmath22 is the elementary charge .",
    "although @xmath17 increased almost exponentially with the application of @xmath23 , the @xmath17-@xmath23 behaviour is different from that in the conventional subthreshold regime .",
    "in fact , all our samples showed extremely large @xmath24 , @xmath510@xmath6/vs at large carrier densities ( _ i.e. _ , large @xmath23 ) without reaching saturation even at room temperature .",
    "thus , we set the threshold voltage @xmath25=0 .",
    "notably , @xmath24 is an order of magnitude larger than earlier reports for a parylene - c / srtio@xmath4  fet at room temperature ( @xmath24=0.3@xmath6/vs for @xmath26=3@xmath2710@xmath28@xmath1 ) @xcite , and comparable to the bulk hall mobility of srtio@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the typical @xmath17-@xmath29 characteristics of sample b in fig .",
    "[ fetcharact](a ) indicate that the current saturates for large @xmath29 as in conventional semiconductor fets , where it occurs due to the pinch - off of the channel .",

    "[ fetcharact](a ) is plotted against the voltage drop inside the channel @xmath19 , fig .",
    "[ fetcharact](b ) .",
    "hence , the pinch - off region is rather small even at low @xmath23 and emerges between the drain and the v@xmath2 electrode for @xmath29 below 5v .",
    "[ fetcharact](c ) shows that the current increases monotonically from @xmath51na to @xmath5100@xmath9a as the gate voltage increases up to 40v , thereby demonstrating a continuous electrostatic control of the sheet carrier density .",

    "c ) channel current of samplec plotted against @xmath23 for @xmath29=5v . ]    furthermore , for small fixed values of @xmath23 , although the channel current does not change very much ( fig.[s - shape](a ) ) , the ratio @xmath30 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "this feature can be associated with the formation of field domains @xcite .",
    "we also observe that in various parameter conditions , @xmath30 approaches the geometrical value @xmath50.37=(v@xmath8-v@xmath2 distance 295@xmath9m)/(source - drain distance 800@xmath9 m ) .",
    "this indicates that in those regimes the contact resistance between srtio@xmath4  and al electrodes , which is expected to be ohmic , is indeed negligibly small compared to the channel resistance of srtio@xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting , however , to observe the behaviour of @xmath30 with increasing @xmath23 and with fixed ( small ) value of @xmath29 in fig.[s - shape](a ) .",
    "this feature is the so - called s - type negative differential resistivity ( sndr ) associated with the formation of current filaments @xcite .",

    "the voltages are expressed in arbitrary units .",
    "see supplementary materials for details . ]",
    "the rather complicated behaviour of the @xmath17 vs @xmath31 curves in fig.[s - shape](a ) was qualitatively reproduced ( fig.[s - shape](b ) ) by a model calculation based on the following assumptions : ( i ) the existence of a low @xmath23 regime where charge carriers are mainly spatially and inhomogeneously confined in cells , and move through the channel region by incoherent tunnelling , ( ii ) a higher @xmath23 regime where the conductive cells overlap and percolating conduction paths are formed , and ( iii ) a well developed homogeneous 2deg with barriers formed at the interfaces .",
    "we modelled the experimental system through a 2d resistor network array where the transport properties of each cell is determined primarily by the local electron density .",
    "the cells are assumed to be randomly distributed shallow potential wells for carriers with a site dependent potential strength @xmath32 . at low @xmath23 and @xmath29 , the cells have low density and the carriers are confined .",
    "the carriers move between cells by a variable range hopping ( vrh ) mechanism . at",
    "higher applied voltages , the occupation of cells increases and the carriers delocalise , augmenting their mobility . for given external potentials @xmath23 and @xmath29 , we solve for the resistor network and compute the local voltages at all cells along the 2d channel .",
    "these local voltages are then compared to the corresponding values of the local confining potential of the cell @xmath32 .",
    "if their difference is negative , the mobility is assumed to be the vrh type , whereas if it is positive , we adopt a much larger value , consistent with a band - like conduction in the metallic state .",
    "the interfaces at the source and drain electrodes are simply modelled as barriers with potential height @xmath33 .",
    "the details of the model and the numerical study are presented in the supplementary materials .",
    "our numerical study captures the qualitative transport behaviour shown in fig.[s - shape ] , providing new insight to the conduction states of 2degs in srtio@xmath4 .",
    "in fact , it demonstrates that the system evolves through a variety of regimes connected through crossovers depicted schematically in fig.[inhomo ] .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the parylene - c / ta@xmath2o@xmath3  bilayer overcomes previous limitations , achieving the required large electrostatic carrier doping , while keeping a high quality interface with the tmo .",
    "the hybrid gate insulator can sustain a sheet carrier density of 8@xmath2710@xmath28@xmath1 , without introducing formidable damage to the channel interface , as the field - effect mobility of srtio@xmath4  exceeds 10@xmath6/vs , even at room temperature .",
    "the excellent agreement of our numerical study with measurements on the hybrid gate insulator , indicate a continuous evolution through a variety of different regimes , including tuneability of field domains and current filaments on the surface of srtio@xmath4 .",
    "our findings provide a novel method for paraelectrical tuning of metal - nonmetal transitions in correlated electron devices made of abo@xmath34-type tmos .",
    "notably , the fabrication details and physical mechanism reported here may be applied towards emergent oxide electronics controlled by low dimensional charge carrier transport .",
    "schematic pictures of the evolution of conductive cells in the channel as demonstrated in fig.[s - shape ] . for increasing @xmath23 ,",
    "the channel varies from insulator to relatively good metal as the size of the conductive cells increases and a percolating current filament is formed .",
    "this represents sndr .",
    "meanwhile , for increasing @xmath29 , the region near the drain electrode is pinched off . by controlling the two parameters @xmath29 and @xmath23 , we can realise the formation and continuous evolution of field domains and current filaments ; _ i.e. _ , the competition of sndr and the interface depletion at drain , which is not only the main topic of the research for the resistance change memory @xcite but also a common problem associated to the future oxide electronics .",
    "the filament can be ruptured by the joule - heating at the interface to the metal electrode ( called faucet @xcite ) ; one of the widely accepted models of the non - volatile resistance change ( fuse - antifuse resistive switching @xcite ) . ]",
    "further to the practical interest , low temperature studies on similar devices would reveal whether granular superconductivity @xcite in srtio@xmath4  could be realised for small @xmath23 and @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , the behaviour of possible superconducting cells with dimensions comparable to characteristic length scales may be considerably different from bulk materials .",
    "moreover , the quantum confinement in the cells may lift the degeneracy of the lowest energy band of srtio@xmath4 , affecting the rashba effect on its surface @xcite .",
    "preparation of parylene - c  thin film was performed as follows . in a @xmath3546 mm quartz tube ,",
    "di - monochloro-_para_-xylylene was sublimated at 150@xmath36 , the dimer flew into a high temperature ( 800@xmath36 ) region @xcite , where it was cleaved into two monomer units @xcite .",
    "the reactive intermediates were then transported to a room temperature deposition chamber at the pressure of 2@xmath2710@xmath37pa . upon condensation on the surface of single - crystalline srtio@xmath4 ,",
    "spontaneous polymerisation into parylene - c  took place .",
    "the parylene - c  thin film deposited through this so - called gorham method@xcite provides excellent conformal coating on the srtio@xmath4  surface .",
    "the thin film of ta@xmath2o@xmath3  was deposited directly on the top of the parylene - c  by radio frequency ( rf ) sputtering at room temperature .",
    "we used a ta@xmath2o@xmath3  ceramic target in a flowing ar gas of 25sccm and 5.5pa .",
    "the rf power was 2w / inch@xmath38 , and the sample - target distance was 140 mm .",
    "the thickness of the ta@xmath2o@xmath3  layer was @xmath5200 nm measured by a surface profiler ( kla tencor ) . on the top of ta@xmath2o@xmath3 , a 150 nm thick au gate electrode with a 5 nm ti adhesion layer was deposited by electron - beam deposition .",
    "the thickness of the parylene - c  layer was estimated from the measured capacitance of a built - in capacitor ( of area 800@xmath27800@xmath9m@xmath39 ) , using the known values @xmath11=3.2 for parylene - c , and @xmath11=25 for ta@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "we used the al metal for source and drain electrodes ; al gives ohmic contact to srtio@xmath4 .",
    "for the other parts of the device fabrication process , we followed the same method and used the same materials as reported by nakamura _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite    for some samples , the thickness of the gate insulator was also measured by an s-4800 ( hitachi high - tech ) scanning electron microscope ( sem ) ; the values were in good agreement with those estimated from the capacitance .",
    "since the parylene - c  is much softer than ta@xmath2o@xmath3 , when we tried to expose the cross sections for the sem measurement , either cutting with a scalpel or simply cleaving , the bilayer at room temperature easily deformed ( stretches and shrinks at the ends ) the parylene - c  layer , and the fibrils of parylene - c  always extended out of the cross section . we found that freezing the samples in liquid n@xmath40 facilitates the cleaving .",
    "[ images](b ) shows the comparison of the cross section of a sample cleaved at room - temperature and one at liquid - n@xmath40 temperature .",
    "the parylene - c  cross section in the latter case appears rather lumpy .",
    "however , this was never observed in the cross sections of the samples cleaved at room - temperature ; thus , it is likely that the uneven cross section is due to the steep rise of temperature with heavy bedewing in air after the cleavage in liquid - n@xmath40 .",
    "it has been shown that a conventionally deposited planar parylene - c  thin film @xcite does not possess nanostructured morphology @xcite .",
