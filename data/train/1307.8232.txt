    "in practical control systems , we often need to minimize the control effort so as to achieve control objectives under limitations in equipment such as actuators , sensors , and networks .",
    "for example , the energy ( or @xmath1-norm ) of a control signal is minimized to prevent engine overheating or to reduce transmission cost with a standard lq ( linear quadratic ) control problem ; see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "another example is the _ minimum - fuel _ control , discussed in e.g. , @xcite , in which the total expenditure of fuel is minimized with the @xmath0 norm of the control .",
    "alternatively , in some situations , the control effort can be dramatically reduced by holding the control value _ exactly zero _ over a time interval .",
    "we call such control a _ hands - off control_. 0 a motivation for hands - off control is computer - controlled drug administration . in blood pressure control @xcite for example , a patient should be connected to a controlled pump while a drug is infused , and if the duration of infusion is reduced by hands - off control , the patient significantly benefits .",
    "a motivation for hands - off control is a stop - start system in automobiles .",
    "it is a hands - off control ; it automatically shuts down the engine to avoid it idling for long periods of time . by this",
    ", we can reduce co or co2 emissions as well as fuel consumption @xcite .",
    "this strategy is also used in hybrid vehicles @xcite ; the internal combustion engine is stopped when the vehicle is at a stop or the speed is lower than a preset threshold , and the electric motor is alternatively used .",
    "thus hands - off control is also available for solving environmental problems .",
    "hands - off control is also desirable for networked and embedded systems since the communication channel is not used during a period of zero - valued control .",
    "this property is advantageous in particular for wireless communications @xcite .",
    "in other words , hands - off control is the least _ attention _ in such periods . from this point of view",
    ", hands - off control that maximizes the total time of no attention is somewhat related to the concept of minimum attention control @xcite .",
    "motivated by these applications , we propose a new paradigm of control , called _ maximum - hands - off control _ that maximizes the time interval over which the control is exactly zero .",
    "the hands - off property is related to _ sparsity _ , or the _",
    "@xmath2 `` norm '' _ ( the quotation marks indicate that this is not a norm ; see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] below ) of a signal , defined by the total length of the intervals over which the signal takes non - zero values .",
    "the maximum - hands - off control , in other words , seeks the _",
    "sparsest _ ( or @xmath2-optimal ) control among all admissible controls .",
    "this problem is however hard to solve since the cost function is non - convex and discontinuous . to overcome the difficulty",
    ", one can adopt @xmath0 optimality as a convex approximation of the problem , as often used in _ compressed sensing _",
    ", which has recently attracted significant attention in signal processing ; see @xcite for details .",
    "compressed sensing has shown by theory and experiments that sparse high - dimensional signals can be reconstructed from incomplete measurements by using @xmath0 optimization ; see e.g. , @xcite .    interestingly ,",
    "an @xmath0-optimal ( or minimum - fuel ) control has been known to have such a sparsity property , traditionally called _",
    "`` bang - off - bang '' _ as in @xcite .",
    "although advantage has implicitly taken of the sparsity property for minimizing the fuel consumption , there has been no research on the theoretical connection between sparsity and @xmath0 optimality of the control . in this article , we prove that a solution to an @xmath0-optimal control problem gives a maximum - hands - off control , and vice versa . as a result , the sparsest solution ( i.e. , the maximum - hands - off control ) can be obtained by solving an @xmath0-optimal control problem .",
    "a consequence of our result is that maximum hands - off control necessarily has a `` bang - off - bang '' property ; the control abruptly changes its values between @xmath3 and @xmath4 at switching times ( @xmath5 is the admissible maximum absolute value of control ) . in some applications",
    ", this feature should be avoided . to make the control continuous in time , we propose a new type of control , namely , _",
    "@xmath0/@xmath1-optimal control_. we show that the @xmath0/@xmath1-optimal control is an intermediate control between the maximum - hands - off ( or @xmath0-optimal ) and the minimum energy ( or @xmath1-optimal ) controls , in the sense that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 controls are the limiting instances of the @xmath0/@xmath1-optimal control .",
