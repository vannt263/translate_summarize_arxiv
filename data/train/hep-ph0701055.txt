    "models with warped extra dimensions  @xcite represent a very exciting alternative to more traditional extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , like supersymmetry .",
    "these models provide not only a natural solution to the hierarchy problem , but also a very compelling theory of flavor , when fermions are allowed to propagate in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "the large hierarchies among the different fermion masses arise in a natural way , without inducing new sources of flavor violation for the first and second generation fermions . on the the other hand , large flavor violation effects",
    "are predicted for the third generation fermions , most notably for the top quark  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently realized that an enlarged bulk gauge symmetry , @xmath5 can act as a custodial symmetry that protects two of the most constraining observables from large tree - level corrections : the peskin - takeuchi @xcite @xmath1 parameter  @xcite and , if an extra discrete left - right symmetry @xmath6 is imposed , the anomalous @xmath7 coupling  @xcite . coupling .",
    "] when the zero modes of the first two generations are localized far from the ir brane , so as to explain the low - energy flavor structure , an analysis of the electroweak ( ew ) precision data based on the oblique corrections parametrized by @xmath8 and @xmath1 , together with the heavy flavor asymmetries and branching ratios , takes into account the most important effects .",
    "therefore , at tree level , the custodial protection of the @xmath1 parameter and the @xmath9 coupling leaves the @xmath8 parameter as the only relevant constraint .",
    "however , as emphasized in  @xcite , there are calculable one - loop corrections to the precision electroweak observables , which can be relevant and should be taken into account .",
    "in fact , for the choice of quantum numbers that lead to the custodial protection of the @xmath9 coupling , it was shown that the contribution of these loop corrections yields tight constraints on the parameters of these models , which in turn can have interesting implications for the spectrum of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states and their phenomenology .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed an analysis of the constraints from precision electroweak observables , including one - loop effects , for a specific model based on gauge - higgs unification , when the light fermions are localized near the uv brane .",
    "we obtained a bound on the mass of the first level kk excitations of the gauge bosons of about @xmath10-@xmath11 tev , together with light kk quarks with masses of order of a few hundred gev , some of them with exotic electric charges .",
    "since the @xmath8 parameter yields one of the most relevant constraints in these models , one would like to investigate whether scenarios with the light generation fermions localized near the conformal point ( flat wavefunctions for the zero - modes ) , where the couplings of these fermions to the @xmath12 kk modes are suppressed , can lead to a better fit  @xcite .",
    "generically , however , an analysis based on the oblique approximation is not sufficient in this region , since the couplings of fermions to @xmath13 gauge bosons tend to induce anomalous , nonuniversal couplings to the @xmath14 and @xmath2 gauge bosons .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , due to the custodial symmetry , the corrections to the @xmath1 parameter and the @xmath9 vertex can not receive contributions from higher dimension 5d operators suppressed by a low cutoff scale and are , therefore , calculable .",
    "in addition , in any given model these two quantities satisfy a definite correlation which , in general , may be understood in terms of the contribution of the lightest kk modes . the potentially large loop corrections to the @xmath1 parameter and the @xmath15 coupling , as well as the effects of the associated correlations , must be considered in any model that makes use of the custodial symmetry .",
    "this includes models of gauge - higgs unification @xcite and models with a fundamental higgs or even without a higgs @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present the results of a global fit to all relevant ew precision observables , taking into account the correlations among them as well as possible non - universal effects , in a particular setting .",
    "we have chosen to test these ideas in the context of gauge - higgs unification scenarios , which we find particularly well motivated theoretically since they address the little hierarchy problem present in randall - sundrum models with a fundamental higgs .",
    "in addition , this framework naturally leads to light kk fermion states , often with exotic charges , that makes these scenarios quite interesting from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we introduce the model in section  [ model : section ] and discuss its main effects on ew observables in section  [ effects : section ] .",
    "the results of the global fit are reported in section  [ fit : section ] and we discuss some simple variations in section  [ variations ] . in section  [",
    "example : section ] we present an interesting example which allows for light kk fermions for the three generations within the reach of present and near future colliders .",
    "we discuss the bounds from ew precision observables in combination with those from direct searches at the tevatron .",
    "we also discuss interesting search channels at the lhc .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ conclusions : section ] .",
    "some technical results are given in the appendix .",
    "our setup is a 5-dimensional model in a warped background , @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the bulk gauge symmetry is @xmath18 , broken by boundary conditions to @xmath19 on the ir brane ( @xmath20 ) , and to the standard model @xmath21 gauge group on the uv brane ( @xmath22 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 charges are adjusted so as to recover the correct hypercharges , where @xmath24 with @xmath25 the third @xmath13 generator and @xmath26 the @xmath23 charge .",
    "the fifth component of the gauge fields in @xmath27 has a ( four - dimensional scalar ) zero mode with the quantum numbers of the higgs boson .",
    "this zero mode has a non - trivial profile in the extra dimension  @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 labels the generators of @xmath30 , and is exponentially localized towards the ir brane @xmath31 hence giving a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the dots in eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) stand for massive kk modes that are eaten by the corresponding kk gauge fields .",
    "the sm fermions are embedded in full representations of the bulk gauge group .",
    "the presence of the @xmath32 subgroup of the full bulk gauge symmetry ensures the custodial protection of the @xmath1 parameter @xcite . in order to have a custodial protection of the @xmath33 coupling , the choice @xmath34 has to be enforced @xcite .",
    "an economical choice is to let the sm @xmath35 top - bottom doublet arise from a @xmath36 of @xmath37 , where the subscript refers to the @xmath38 charge . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "putting the sm @xmath35 singlet top in the same @xmath39 multiplet as the doublet , without further mixing , is disfavored since , for the correct value of the top quark mass , this leads to a large negative contribution to the @xmath1 parameter at one loop .",
    "hence we let the right - handed top quark arise from a second @xmath36 of @xmath37 .",
    "the right handed bottom can come from a @xmath40 that allows to write the bottom yukawa coupling . for simplicity , and because it allows the generation of the ckm mixing matrix , we make the same choice for the first two quark generations .",
    "we therefore introduce in the quark sector three @xmath39 multiplets per generation as follows : @xmath41 where we show the decomposition under @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 s are bidoublets of @xmath42 , with @xmath12 acting vertically and @xmath32 acting horizontally .",
    "the @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s transform as @xmath46 and @xmath47 under @xmath42 , respectively , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are @xmath42 singlets .",
    "the superscripts , @xmath50 , label the three generations .",
    "we also show the boundary conditions on the indicated 4d chirality , where @xmath51 stands for dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath52 stands for a linear combination of neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , that is determined via the fermion bulk equations of motion from the dirichlet boundary condition obeyed by the opposite chirality . in the absence of mixing among multiplets satisfying different boundary conditions ,",
    "the sm fermions arise as the zero - modes of the fields obeying @xmath53 boundary conditions .",
    "the remaining boundary conditions are chosen so that @xmath54 is preserved on the ir brane , and so that mass mixing terms , necessary to obtain the sm fermion masses after ew symmetry breaking , can be written on the ir brane .",
    "it is possible to flip the boundary conditions on @xmath55 , consistently with these requirements , and we will comment on such a possibility in later sections .    as for the leptons ,",
    "one option is to embed the sm @xmath35 lepton doublets into the @xmath56 representation of @xmath57 and the @xmath35 charged lepton singlets in a @xmath58 .",
    "right - handed neutrinos may come from the @xmath59 singlet in the @xmath56 , or from a different @xmath60 , as in the quark sector .",
    "the boundary conditions may then be chosen in analogy with those in eq .",
    "( [ multiplets ] ) .",
    "a second possibility is that the leptons , unlike the quarks , arise from the 4-dimensional spinorial representation of @xmath39 , so that the sm lepton doublets transform as @xmath61 under @xmath42 , while the sm lepton singlets transform as @xmath62 .    as remarked above",
    ", the zero - mode fermions can acquire ew symmetry breaking masses through mixing effects .",
    "the most general @xmath63 invariant mass lagrangian at the ir brane compatible with the boundary conditions is , in the quark sector , @xmath64 ~ , \\label{localizedmasses}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are dimensionless @xmath68 matrices , and a matrix notation is employed .",
    "in order to study the effects that the kk excitations of bulk fermions and gauge bosons have on ew observables , we compute the effective lagrangian that results after integrating them out at tree level , keeping the leading corrections with operators of dimension six . as was mentioned in the introduction , some one - loop corrections are also important and will be included on top of the tree - level effects .",
    "in fact , in models with custodial protection of the @xmath9 coupling , some of the kk fermions become considerably lighter than the kk gauge bosons , and can give relevant loop level effects as a result of their strong mixing with the top quark . the loop contributions to the ew observables coming from the gauge boson kk excitations",
    "are suppressed due to their larger masses , as well as to the fact that they couple via the ew gauge couplings , that are smaller than the top yukawa coupling .",
    "thus we expect their one - loop effects on ew observables to be subleading and we neglect them .      in this section ,",
    "we compute the effective lagrangian up to dimension six operators , obtained when the heavy physics in the models discussed in the previous section is integrated out at tree level .",
    "we will express the effective lagrangian in the basis of  @xcite where the dimension six operators are still @xmath69 invariant .",
    "the procedure is the following .",
    "we integrate out the heavy physics in an explicitly @xmath69 invariant way and then use the sm equations of motion if necessary to write the resulting operators in the basis of  @xcite .",
    "only a subset of the 81 operators in that basis is relevant for ew precision observables , as discussed in  @xcite . at the order we are considering",
    ", we can integrate out independently each type of heavy physics .",
    "the effective lagrangian in the basis of  @xcite after integrating out the heavy gauge bosons reads @xmath70 where the dots represent other operators that are irrelevant for the analysis of ew observables . here",
    "@xmath71 stands for the sm higgs , @xmath72 and @xmath73 refer to the @xmath35 doublet quark and leptons , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 refer to the sm @xmath35 quark and lepton singlets .",
    "the list of the dimension - six operators generated in our model is :    * oblique operators @xmath77 * two - fermion operators @xmath78 * four - fermion operators @xmath79    the coefficients @xmath80 encode the dependence on the different parameters of our model and their explicit form is given in the appendix .",

    "this contribution to the @xmath8 parameter comes from a field redefinition that absorbs a global shift in the gauge couplings of the light fermions into the oblique @xmath8 parameter .",
    "here we do not do that field redefinition as the shift in the couplings is automatically included in the global fit . ]",
    "although higher dimensional models are nonrenormalizable and many observables receive contributions from higher - dimension operators whose coefficients can only be determined by an unspecified uv completion , it is noteworthy that some of the low - energy observables are actually insensitive to the uv physics .",
    "this is the case of the peskin - takeuchi @xmath1 parameter and of the @xmath9 coupling in models with custodial symmetry and the quantum numbers used in this paper . in particular , loop contributions to these parameters",
    "are dominated by the kk scale .",
    "this follows simply from the fact that the assumed symmetries ( @xmath90 with a discrete symmetry exchanging @xmath91 with @xmath92 ) and quantum number assignments do not allow for local 5d counterterms that can contribute to these observables .",
    "note , however , that one can write operators that contribute to the @xmath93 coupling .",

    "the important observation made in that work is that the presence of bidoublets , necessary to protect the tree - level contribution to the @xmath9 coupling , typically induces a negative @xmath1 parameter at one loop .",

    "we give the detailed formulas in the appendix , which can be easily evaluated numerically .",
    "the largest contributions arise from the kk excitations that couple via the top yukawa coupling . in the case of the @xmath1 parameter",
    ", the quantitative features can be understood from the following types of contributions :    * a negative contribution to @xmath1 from the lightest bidoublet excitations that violate the custodial symmetry via the boundary conditions , @xmath94 in the notation of eq .",
    "( [ multiplets ] ) . * a positive contribution to @xmath1 from the lightest @xmath95 singlet kk excitations , @xmath96 in the notation of eq .",
    "( [ multiplets ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we also gave approximate analytic formulas for the above contributions .",
    "the expressions for the bidoublet are somewhat complicated , but the negative contribution arises from the first kk mode of the @xmath97 @xmath35 doublet , that is lighter and couples more strongly to the higgs than the lightest kk mode of the @xmath98 @xmath35 doublet ( which gives a partially compensating positive contribution ) . notice that the contribution due to the @xmath99 bidoublet is extremely small , even when these modes are very light , since the custodial symmetry is preserved by their boundary conditions",
    ". they can give a nonvanishing contribution to @xmath1 only from mixing with other bidoublets that violate the custodial symmetry .",
    "our choice for the boundary conditions of @xmath99 is motivated by the desire to forbid a localized mixing mass term between @xmath100 and @xmath99 , that would make the @xmath97 kk modes very light and their contribution to the @xmath1 parameter large and negative ( which as we will review below is disfavored by the ew precision data .",

    "it is in the above sense that we regard very light bidoublets as a rather well - motivated signature of the scenarios we are studying .",

    "there are additional contributions from the mixing between bidoublet and singlet kk modes , but we do not give the analytic expressions here since they are somewhat complicated .",
    "the dominant contribution arises from the singlet , but the mixing terms can also give a relevant effect .",
    "it should be noted that , although these contributions depend on several mass and mixing parameters , within the context of an extra dimensional theory all of these are highly correlated by the shape of the wavefunctions . as an example , we show in fig .",

    "a scan over parameter space shows that the ew fit favors the light right - handed ( rh ) quarks and leptons to be localized near the uv brane ( @xmath143 ) and the left - handed ( lh ) quarks and leptons to be localized close to each other .",

    "there are potentially important contributions from fermion kk modes both at tree- and loop - level .",
    "the tree - level effects arise from mixing , after electroweak symmetry breaking , between the zero - mode and the massive fermion modes , and can affect the couplings to the gauge bosons of the sm fermions . since the region where the localized masses are of order one corresponds to the case where the zero - mode fermions are far from the ir brane , and since the mixing effects are proportional to the overlap between this wavefunction and the higgs profile , which is localized near the ir brane , it is easy to see that the relevant mixing angles are exponentially suppressed . on the other hand , when the zero - mode fermions are near the ir brane , the localized masses are forced to be small due to the smallness of the light fermion masses , so that the mixing effects are again suppressed ( for the down - type fermions , the custodial symmetry enforces additional cancellations ) .",
    "we have checked that these tree - level effects are always numerically negligible .",
    "the second class of potentially large effects arises at loop level . when the zero - mode fermions are near the ir brane , the loop effects are directly proportional to the fourth power of the small localized mixing parameters .",
    "when the zero - mode fermions are localized near the uv brane , although the loop contributions involving mixing with the zero mode are exponentially suppressed as above , there are loop contributions involving only mixing among massive kk states , that are not necessarily negligible .",

    "we have also verified that the @xmath8 parameter has only a weak dependence on the localized mixing masses .",
    "thus , we conclude that for the purpose of the ew fit analysis , the mixing masses involving the light generations can be neglected ( although , of course , they are important in reproducing the correct fermion masses and mixing angles ) . therefore , we are left with six relevant model parameters : @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath122 , @xmath124 , @xmath123 and @xmath154 .",
    "it should be noted that in models of gauge - higgs unification the higgs potential that is induced at loop - level is also calculable @xcite .",
    "therefore , given the matter and gauge content of the model , the scale of new physics , @xmath154 , is tied to the scale of ew symmetry breaking by the gauge and yukawa couplings ( the latter ones , as determined by the localized mass parameters ) .",
    "however , it is possible to imagine additional matter content that could affect the higgs potential without having an impact on the ew precision measurements ( e.g. 5d fermion multiplets without zero - modes and with exotic quantum numbers that do not allow mixing with the sm fermions ) .",
    "therefore , we treat @xmath154 as an effectively independent parameter .",
    "given the correlation between @xmath154 and the higgs vev in any such model , one can use our bounds on @xmath154 to get an idea of whether the model is excluded or not ( however , if @xmath154 turns out to be too small , an analysis that goes beyond the linear treatment of the higgs couplings used here might be necessary ) . on the other hand , our approach allows us to apply our bounds to more general models with a bulk higgs , and where the yukawa couplings arise in a similar manner as in gauge - higgs unification scenarios .",
    "we will also assume that , as happens in gauge - higgs unification scenarios , the higgs is light , and we have used a higgs mass @xmath155 .    it was shown in ref .",

    "models with warped extra dimensions explain in a compelling way the hierarchy between the planck and ew scales .",
    "bulk fermions provide also a rationale for the observed hierarchy of fermion masses and the absence , for the light fermions , of large flavor changing neutral currents or large new effects from physics above the ultraviolet cut - off of the theory .",
    "the sm gauge bosons and third generation quarks , however , have a sizable coupling to heavy states through the higgs field .",
    "these couplings induce large corrections to the @xmath1 parameter and the coupling of the left - handed bottom quark to the @xmath2 gauge boson unless some symmetry forbids them .",
    "an enlarged bulk gauge symmetry can act as a custodial symmetry , @xmath257 , that protects both the @xmath1 parameter and the @xmath7 coupling .",
    "when such a symmetry is broken only on the uv brane , these two observables acquire a distinctive status : they are insensitive to uv physics except for effects that are suppressed by a scale of order @xmath258 .",
