    "lattice gases , together with the potts ( including ising ) and the o@xmath10 model , play an important role in the statistical mechanics .",
    "they are used to describe universal properties of many complex physical systems , ranging from simple fluids to structural glasses and granular materials .",
    "lattice - gas models are generally defined as follows . for a given lattice , a number of particles is randomly distributed over its vertices with the constraint that each vertex can at most be occupied by one particle ; the density of particles is controlled by the chemical potential @xmath11 .",
    "particles on different vertices can interact with one another  normally through two - body interactions .",
    "accordingly , the reduced hamiltonian ( already divided by @xmath12 with boltzmann factor @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 ) of a lattice - gas model can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the absence and the presence of a particle , respectively .",
    "the second term with amplitude @xmath17 describes the first - neighbor interactions , and the third one with @xmath18 is for the second - neighbor couplings ; further - neighbor interactions can be included , as denoted by symbol @xmath19 .    in the study of lattice gases ,",
    "one often takes the hard - core limit : in eq .",
    "( [ def_h_gas ] ) the couplings @xmath20 outside a certain range @xmath21 are set zero , while @xmath22 is taken to the limit @xmath23 ; namely , the particles have a hard - core of radius @xmath24 .",
    "a particular example is the lattice - gas model with nearest - neighbor exclusion : @xmath25 while all further - neighbor couplings are zero .",
    "unlike the potts model and the o@xmath10 spin model , the nature and the universality of the phase transitions in lattice - gas systems depend on the lattice structures .",
    "for instance , the lattice - gas model with nearest - neighbor exclusions on the square and the honeycomb lattice is believed to be ising - like , while that on the triangular lattice ( baxter s hard - hexagon model  @xcite ) belongs to the 3-state potts universality class .",
    "extensive investigations have been carried out for lattice gases , and many theoretical and numerical approaches are applied .",
    "this includes exact calculations ( mainly by baxter and coauthors ) , series expansions ( like high - temperature and low - temperature expansions ) , cluster variation method , transfer matrix calculations , and monte carlo simulations etc .",
    "the critical free energy of baxter s hard - hexagon lattice gas was exactly calculated  @xcite ; the critical chemical potential is known as @xmath26 $ ] , and the critical particle density is @xmath27 .",
    "baxter s hard - square model  @xcite , defined by eq .",
    "( [ def_h_gas ] ) on the square lattice with @xmath25 and finite @xmath18 , is known to have a tricritical point @xmath28 in the tricritical ising universality class ; the tricritical point lies at @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 . using the transfer - matrix technique , guo and coauthors@xcite",
    "determine the critical point of the hard - core square lattice gas up to the eleventh decimal place , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "recently , monte carlo simulations were carried out for square lattice gases with the hard - core radius up to the fifth neighbors  @xcite .",
    "the nature of phase transitions was found to be continuous for exclusions up to 1n , to 2n , and to 4n , and to be discontinuous for exclusions up to 3n and 5n , where symbols @xmath34 represents the @xmath35th neighbors .    in this work",
    ", we shall consider the hard - core lattice gas on the triangular lattice with the first- and the second - neighbor repulsions .",
    "the triangular lattice in this case can be divided into four sublattices ( see fig.[fig_lg4 ] ) , and for sufficiently high density particles prefer to occupying one of the four sublattices .",
    "thus , one would expect that , if it is second order , the melting of ordered phase should be in the 4-state potts universality class .",
    "however , several studies at the end of 60s last century suggested that the phase transition is first order  @xcite .",
    "later , bartelt and einstein  @xcite reexamined this model by a phenomenological renormalization  transfer - matrix scaling .",
    "the largest system size in their study is @xmath36 . slowly convergent finite - size corrections were observed .",
    "it was estimated that the thermal and the magnetic critical exponents are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . despite the noticeable deviations from the exact values @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite",
    ", these estimates are in favor of the 4-state potts universality in view of the possible occurrence of logarithmic corrections .    here",
    ", we aim to provide an independent study of this model by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "this seems justified since no rigorous argument exists about the nature of the phase transition and the evidence in ref .",
    "@xcite is not very strong . to properly analyze finite - size corrections , more accurate numerical data , particularly for large system sizes , are desirable   and @xmath41  @xcite , which would imply @xmath42",
    "this result is significantly different from the general accepted value @xmath43 for the ising universality class in three dimensions  @xcite . ] .",
    "our task becomes now feasible because of the availability of efficient cluster algorithm for lattice - gas models  the geometric cluster algorithm  and the rapid development of computer industry in the past few decades .",
    "the geometric cluster algorithm  @xcite moves round a fraction of particles over the lattice according to geometric symmetries , such as the spatial inversion or rotation symmetries of the triangular lattice ; detailed description will be given in sec .",
    "ii . the algorithm does not change the total number of particles , and it is combined with the metropolis steps in order to simulate lattice - gas systems in the grand - canonical ensemble . in comparison with simulations using the metropolis method only ,",
    "critical slowing down is significantly suppressed .",
    "therefore , we are able to simulate systems as large as @xmath44 within reasonable computer resources .",
    "the geometric cluster algorithm was first proposed by dress and krauth  @xcite in the study of hard - core gases in continuous space . unlike the well - known swendsen - wang ( sw )",
    "cluster method which flips spins , the elementary operation in this algorithm is to move particles . for hard disks ,",
    "the percolation threshold of the cluster formation process deviates significantly from the phase transition of the model .",
    "this is unfortunate since it affects the efficiency of the algorithm .    a single - cluster version of the geometric cluster algorithm was later developed by heringa and blte @xcite for lattice models like the potts model and the lattice gases . here",
    ", we shall briefly describe it in terms of the lattice - gas model  ( [ def_h_gas ] ) with a soft - core radius of a lattice unit ( finite @xmath45 and all other couplings are zero ) on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for such a geometry , one can set a cartesian coordinate by taking any two perpendicular lines of lattice sites as the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 axis , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the hamiltonian of the system is invariant under geometric operations like reflections about the @xmath46 or the @xmath47 axis or inversion about the center of the coordinate .",
    "further , any configuration will be restored if an operation is subsequently applied twice  namely , these operations are self - inverse",
    ". one can employ any of such geometric operations to formulate a cluster algorithm .",
    "let a pair of nearest - neighboring sites @xmath48 be mapped onto @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "one denotes the energy difference when a neighbor @xmath13 of @xmath35 is interchanged with @xmath50 as @xmath51 , which is @xmath52 ) .",
    "the algorithm then involves the following steps :    1 .",
    "choose a random site @xmath35 : both @xmath35 and @xmath53 belong to the cluster .",
    "2 .   interchange @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "3 .   for all neighbors @xmath13 of @xmath35 that do not belong to the cluster yet , do the following : * if @xmath56 , do the following with probability @xmath57 : ( a ) interchange @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath13 and @xmath50 are included in the cluster ) , ( b ) write @xmath13 in a list of addresses ( called the stack ) . * if @xmath60 , do nothing .",
    "4 .   read an address @xmath61 from the stack .",
    "substitute @xmath61 for @xmath35 , and execute step 3 .",
    "5 .   erase @xmath61 from the stack .",
    "repeat steps 4 and 5 until the stack is empty .",
    "when the stack is empty , the cluster is completed .",
    "since the elementary operation is to interchange spins @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the total number of particles does not change in the algorithm .    for the above geometric cluster steps , the detailed balance has already been proved@xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this algorithm for different models has also been demonstrated .",
    "for the ising model , it was shown that the percolation of the formed clusters coincides with the thermal phase transition , reflecting the efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "in fact , in the canonical ensemble ( the total number of particles is fixed ) , it can be shown that , for many models , no critical slowing down exist for some quantities  @xcite .    here",
    "we shall formulate a full - cluster version of the geometric cluster algorithm in an analogous way as the edward - sokal picture for the well - known sw cluster method for the ferromagnetic potts model  @xcite .",
    "we consider the lattice - gas model  ( [ def_h_gas ] ) with finite nearest - neighbor interactions ( @xmath62 ) on a one - dimensional chain with sites labelled as @xmath63 . instead of writing the hamiltonian for a fixed number of particles as a sum of the nearest - neighbor couplings like in eq .",
    "( [ def_h_gas ] ) , we rewrite it as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and the constant @xmath66 denotes the total number of particles .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ def_h_gas1 ] ) is obtained by applying the reflection about the center @xmath67a geometric operation . in this form ,",
    "the ` building blocks ' of the hamiltonian is no longer a pair of neighboring sites , but two pairs of them . if one only uses the spin - interchange operation @xmath68 , the energy associated with each building block is of two levels at most : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the former @xmath71 refers to the status that no operator @xmath72 is applied or it is applied at both vertices @xmath35 and @xmath61 ; instead , the latter @xmath73 means that @xmath72 is applied at @xmath35 ( or @xmath61 ) only .",
    "the values of @xmath71 and @xmath73 depend on the spin configuration @xmath74 on the building block .",
    "for the lattice - gas mode  ( [ def_h_gas1 ] ) , these values are shown in table  [ bond_weight ] .",
    "let us denote the lower and the upper level of @xmath71 and @xmath73 as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the statistical weight associated with each block in eq .",
    "( [ def_h_gas1 ] ) reads @xmath77 on this basis , the partition sum becomes @xmath78 analogously as mapping the potts model onto the random - cluster model , one introduces a bond variable @xmath79 to graphically represent the expansion of the second product in eq .",
    "( [ def_z_gas ] ) : if the term @xmath80 is taken , an occupied bond @xmath81 is placed between sites @xmath35 and @xmath82 ; otherwise , no bond is placed ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this leads to a joint model @xmath84 where the second sum is over all possible bond configurations that are consistent with the spin configuration , and we have already assumed the conventional symbol @xmath85 . given a spin configuration @xmath86 , the expression  ( [ def_z_gas1 ] ) allows us to place bonds and construct clusters as follows : if the spin configuration on a block @xmath35 is at the lower - energy level @xmath75 , one places a bond @xmath81 with probability @xmath87 ; otherwise , place no bonds .",
    "note that a bond connects four lattice sites , since it is placed on the blocks .",
    "lattice sites connected through a chain of occupied bonds form a cluster . the condition @xmath88 for a block can be hold either by doing nothing or interchanging both spins ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus , for a spin - jointed - bond configuration , for each cluster one has the freedom to choose the do - nothing or the spin - interchange operation , and apply it to _ all _ lattice sites within the cluster .",
    "accordingly , a swendsen - wang - like geometric cluster algorithm can be formulated as follows",
    ".    1 .   choose a geometric transformation such that every building block in the hamiltonian consists of two pairs of neighboring couplings and the associated energy is only of two levels under the spin - interchange operation .",
    "2 .   for each building block @xmath35 ( containing four lattice sites ) , if its spin configuration is at the lower - energy @xmath75 , place a bond with probability @xmath90 ; otherwise , place no bond .",
    "3 .   construct clusters according to the occupied bonds .",
    "4 .   independently for each cluster , randomly choose the do - nothing or the spin - interchange operation with probability @xmath91 ; apply the chosen operation to all lattice sites within the cluster .",
    "a monte carlo step is completed , and a new spin configuration is obtained .",
    "we expect that the analogy between our formulation of the geometric cluster algorithm and the well - known sw method can help the reader to understand the geometric cluster algorithm .",
    "we conclude this subsection by mentioning the following .",
    "( 1 ) , like the sw method , the essence in the geometric cluster process is that the energy of each building block has two levels only under the spin - interchange operation ( the energy of a building block may have more than two levels if other operations  like the spin - flip operation  are allowed ) . ( 2 ) , normally , the rewriting of the hamiltonian as a sum of proper building blocks is obtained by applying some global geometric transformation , such as the inversion about the center and reflection etc .",
    "( 3 ) , in the canonical ensemble , if one uses the geometric cluster algorithm only , a large number of spatial transformations should be available such that each lattice site in a system should be able to reach any other lattice site by a finite number of geometric mappings . for the torus geometry , this can be easily achieved since any site can serve as the center of the aforementioned cartesian coordinate . in case",
    "that the geometric cluster method is itself non - ergodic , it can be combined with other algorithms like the kawasaki dynamic .",
    "( 4 ) , for simulations in the grand - canonical ensemble , other monte carlo methods have to be used .      for the lattice - gas model  ( [ def_h_gas ] ) ,",
    "the triangular lattice is divided into four sublattices .",
    "the particle density is then sampled as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the volume of the lattice and the sum is over each sublattice , labelled as @xmath94 .",
    "the global particle density is then @xmath95 . on this basis",
    ", we measured the second and the fourth moment of the magnetization density as @xmath96 where factor @xmath97 is for normalization purpose such that @xmath98 is a unity when the chemical potential is infinite ",
    "one of the four sublattices is fully occupied .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is @xmath99 .",
    "then , we define a dimensionless ratio as @xmath100 this ratio at criticality approaches a universal value for @xmath101 , and is known to be very useful in estimating critical points .",
    "since a pair of first- ( or second- ) neighboring sites can not be both occupied by particles , we sampled the third - neighbor correlation as an energy - like quantity @xmath102 where the sum is over all the third - neighbor pairs .",
    "correspondingly , a specific - heat - like quantity is defined as @xmath103 .",
    "we also measured the compressibility @xmath104 .",
    "using a combination of the metropolis and the geometric cluster algorithm , we simulated the lattice - gas model on the triangular lattice with first- and second - neighbor repulsions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in the rhombus geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_lg4 ] .",
    "system sizes took 15 values in range @xmath105 .",
    "several geometric cluster steps are performed between subsequent metropolis steps .",
    "such that the total number of particles moved by the former is also approximately equal to @xmath106 .",
    "significant critical slowing down was observed , with a dynamic exponent about @xmath107 .",
    "some primary simulations for relatively small system sizes were first carried out to find the approximate location of the critical point from the intersection of the @xmath4 data for different system sizes @xmath108 ( we were also guided by the result @xmath109 in ref .",
    "then extensive simulations for large sizes were performed near @xmath110 .",
    "figure [ fig_q ] shows parts of the monte carlo data of the dimensionless ratio @xmath111 . according to the least - squares criterion ,",
    "the @xmath4 data were fitted by @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath79 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 are unknown parameters , and @xmath116 is the universal value .",
    "the terms with @xmath113 describe the contributions of the thermal field due to deviation from the critical point , those with exponent @xmath117 account for finite - size corrections , and the one with @xmath118 is for the mixed effect of the relevant and irrelevant thermal fields .",
    "the term with exponent @xmath119 arises from the regular part of the free energy , where the magnetic exponent @xmath120 was fixed at @xmath121 for the four - state potts model .",
    "the detailed derivation of the finite - size scaling formula  ( [ eq_q ] ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in principle",
    ", one should include logarithmic corrections in eq.([eq_q ] )  @xcite , since the transition is expected to be in the 4-state potts universality class .",
    "unfortunately , the limited system size does not allow us to include such corrections ( accordingly , the statistical error margins of our following results should be taken carefully ) .",
    "from the numerical results for the tricritical 4-state potts model  @xcite where the marginal field is absent , we learn that there exist correction terms with exponent @xmath122 .",
    "thus , we set @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "satisfactory fits can be obtained after a cutoff for small system sizes @xmath125 , which yield @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , without logarithmic corrections , satisfactory fits can include data for rather small sizes and the exponent @xmath129 agrees well with the exact value @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests that logarithmic corrections are small in the @xmath4 data , and thus the fitting results for @xmath4 are more or less reliable .",
    "we then fitted the @xmath5 data by @xmath130 \\ ; ,   \\label{eq_chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 stems from the regular part of the free energy , which acts in eq .",
    "( [ eq_q ] ) as a correction term with exponent @xmath132 .",
    "the correction exponents were also set as @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "after a cutoff for small systems @xmath133 , we obtain @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath137 is consistent with that from @xmath4 , and those for @xmath6 and @xmath120 agree with the exact values . if the exponent @xmath6 is fixed at @xmath9 , one has @xmath134 and @xmath138 after discarding the data for @xmath139 .",

    "the result @xmath144 agrees well with those obtained from magnetic quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , the value @xmath143 significantly differs from @xmath9 .",
    "this might imply that , while additive logarithmic corrections are still small in energy - like quantities , multiplicative logarithmic corrections can not be neglected .",

    "thus , we simply set @xmath24 and @xmath149 to be zero .",
    "the data for @xmath150 are well described by eq .",
    "( [ eq_cv ] ) . the fits for @xmath146 yield @xmath151 , @xmath152 and those for @xmath145 yield @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "again , the estimates of @xmath137 agree well with those from other quantities , while the values of @xmath6 differ significantly from @xmath9 .",
    "we have simulations at @xmath155 , at criticality within the estimated error bars .",
    "thus , we could analyze various quantities right at the critical point .",
    "the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath5 , @xmath140 , and @xmath145 and @xmath146 at criticality is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq_chi ] ) , ( [ eq_rho ] ) , and ( [ eq_cv ] ) , respectively , by throwing out those @xmath11-dependent terms .",
    "the estimates of the associated critical exponents from these simplified analyses are consistent with those from the aforementioned fits .",
    "figures [ fig_chikc ] and [ fig_cekc ] show the critical @xmath5 and @xmath145 data , respectively .",
    "in the language of the lattice gas systems , we formulate a swendsen - wang - like version of the geometric cluster algorithm that has already found many applications  @xcite .",
    "since our formulation is in line with the swendsen - wang algorithm for the ferromagnetic potts model , we expect that it will help the reader to understand the geometric cluster method .",
    "we then study the triangular lattice gases with the first- and the second - neighbor exclusion , using a combination of the metropolis and the geometric cluster algorithm .",
    "the estimated critical point @xmath126 significantly improves over the existing result @xmath156 ; to our knowledge , no report has been published yet for the critical particle density @xmath1 .",
    "the excellent agreement between the exact values and the numerical estimates @xmath157 and @xmath158 give strong support for the expectation that the model is in the 4-state potts universality class .",
    "on the other hand , the fitting results from energy - like quantities imply that , although additive logarithmic corrections might be small , multiplicative logarithmic corrections can not be neglected at least in energy - like quantities .      *",
