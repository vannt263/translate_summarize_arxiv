    "the first - passage exponent is a function of the scaling variable @xmath30 , and ( ii ) the scaling function is exact ( figure [ fig - gamma ] ) .",
    "this finding may indicate that in very high dimensions , the complex boundary confining the composite particle approaches a limiting shape , and that this limiting shape is conical .",
    "another possible scenario is that the complex boundary , which is formed by the intersection of multiple hyperplanes , does not necessarily approach a limiting conical shape , yet the deviations do not affect lowest eigenvalue of the laplace operator .",
    "the scaling function manifests that there is a continuous spectrum of first - passage exponents @xmath247 when @xmath6 .",
    "the smallest exponent vanishes as @xmath248 , while the largest diverges logarithmically .",
    "more precisely , @xmath249 these limiting behaviors follow from asymptotic analysis of with and @xmath215 , and in both cases , we recover results obtained using heuristic scaling arguments @xcite",
    ". we also note that median exponent , which characterizes the probability that the leader always ranks above the median particle , approaches the simple limit @xmath250 .",
    "knowledge of the scaling form , merely the fact that @xmath38 is function of the variable @xmath40 is quite powerful .",
    "this realization enables measurement of first - passage exponents for up to @xmath33 particles , corresponding to diffusion in a staggering spatial dimension @xmath251 . whereas accurate measurement of the ( vanishing ) smallest or the ( diverging ) largest exponent become prohibitive @xcite already at @xmath252 , we are able to compute @xmath38 by measuring the probability that the rank of the original leader remains in the _ first percentile _ rather than strictly remaining _",
    "first_. the numerical simulation also show that not only does the first - passage exponent becomes a function of the scaling variable @xmath40 , but so does the entire survival probability : @xmath253 with @xmath40 in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "rank compares the location of a single particle , the initial leader , with those of the rest of the particles .",
    "generally , there are @xmath226 distinct pairs , and the number of pair inversion @xmath93 treats all particles equally . if initially the particle locations are such that , then the number of pair inversions is @xmath254 with @xmath255 the step function : @xmath256 when @xmath257 and @xmath258 otherwise . in figure [ fig - inversions ]",
    "the initial order is @xmath259 and later , when the order becomes @xmath260 , the number of inversions equals @xmath102 as the pairs @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 are inverted with respect to the initial configuration .",
    "the number of inversions ( also known as the mahonian number ) is a basic measure of a permutation , and it is routinely used in sorting and ranking algorithms @xcite .",
    "the number of inversions lies between @xmath264 and @xmath226 .",
    "there are @xmath229 different permutations of particle order and since the diffusion process is ergodic , all of these permutations become equally probable .",
    "it is easy to show that if initially the particles are regularly spaced , the `` equilibration '' time is quadratic in @xmath4 @xcite . consequently , the equilibrium distribution of the inversion number is given by the well - known mahonian probability distribution @xmath265 that a random permutation of @xmath4 integers has @xmath93 inversions .",
    "the generating function reads @xcite @xmath266 from this generating function , we can obtain the distribution function .",
    "for example , for two particles , @xmath267 , and for three particles , @xmath268 while @xmath269 ( figure [ fig - six]b ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in the cumulative distribution @xmath270 that the number of inversions is smaller than @xmath93 @xmath271      from the generating function , we can obtain the average number of inversions @xmath272 and the standard deviation @xmath273 : @xmath274 notably , the standard deviation is large , @xmath275 . when the number of particles is large , the distribution @xmath276 becomes normal and is characterized by the mean and the standard deviation @xcite .",
    "consequently , the cumulative probability @xmath270 that the inversion number is @xmath277 approaches the complementary error function in the @xmath6 limit : @xmath278    let @xmath279 be the survival probability that the number of inversions remains smaller than @xmath93 up to time @xmath1 .",
    "we anticipate @xmath280 equation shows that @xmath281 when @xmath5 .",
    "numerical simulations confirm that the number of distinct exponents equals @xmath226 .",
    "in contrast with the rank statistics above , the number of distinct exponents is quadratic in @xmath4 .",
    "the quantity @xmath282 equals the probability that the particle order remains intact , and the respective exponent @xmath283 is known analytically @xcite @xmath284 when @xmath100 , the trajectory of the compound brownian particle is confined to one chamber , @xmath285 .",
    "we again use the cone approximation to estimate the first - passage exponents . the fraction calculated from the generating function",
    "is substituted into to give the opening angle @xmath11 . using this angle and @xmath243",
    ", we deduce the exponent from equation .",
    "results of the cone approximation for the case @xmath218 are listed in table 2 .",
    "again , we obtain useful estimates for the first - passage exponents .    to obtain the limiting behavior",
    "when the number of particles diverges , @xmath6 , we substitute into the scaling relation .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath286 becomes a function of the scaling variable @xmath287 defined in and is root of the parabolic cylinder equation , @xmath288 hence , if we focus on the probability that the number of inversions does not exceed a fixed number @xmath287 of standard deviations from the mean , the first - passage process becomes independent of the number of particles .",
    "this realization is especially useful in the case of inversion statistics : the family of exponents is quadratic in @xmath4 , and furthermore , the scaling variable @xmath287 guides us to measure @xmath289 in a scaling window of size @xmath290 around the average , @xmath291 . indeed , by using a finite number of measurements",
    ", we can verify that @xmath292 becomes a function of the scaling variable @xmath287 .",

    "the first - passage exponent characterizing the decay of the survival probability is root of a transcendental equation involving the associated legendre equation .",
    "explicit expressions for this exponent are feasible only in two and four dimensions .",
    "another simplification occurs when @xmath17 where the exponent , which generally depends on the cone opening angle @xmath11 and @xmath16 , becomes a function of a single variable @xmath296 .",
    "this universal function is obtained analytically as a root of the parabolic cylinder function .",
    "we analyzed two first - passage problems involving the order of an ensemble of independent brownian particles in one dimension .",
    "the trajectories of the @xmath4 brownian particles define a compound trajectory of a single brownian particle in @xmath4 dimensions , more precisely in an infinite cone with numerous plane boundaries . as an approximation , we replaced this cone with complex boundary by a circular cone having an identical solid angle .",
    "we showed that the cone approximation yields a lower bound and surprisingly good approximations for the first - passage exponents .",
    "there are families of first - passage exponents that govern kinetics of ordering of brownian particles or equivalently , kinetics of first - passage in high dimensions .",
    "we discussed only two out of many possible measures for particle order : the rank of the original leader and the number of pair inversions . in one case , the number of first - passage exponents is linear in the number of particles ; in the other case , it is quadratic .",
    "the discrete spectrum of exponents becomes continuous when the number of particles diverges .",
    "surprisingly , the cone approximation predicts this spectrum exactly .",
    "an important challenge is to establish when does the confining geometry becomes equivalent to a cone in a high - dimensional space and the conditions for the cone approximation to be asymptotically exact .",
    "we presented two cases for which the scaling function is predicted exactly , but there are counterexamples where the cone approximation correctly predicts the scaling form but fails to predict the actual scaling function @xcite .    the exponents exhibit scaling when the number of particles diverges .",
    "this realization is relevant for numerical simulations @xcite where it is difficult to measure exponents that are either much smaller than or much larger than unity .",
    "the scaling variable specifies the region where the first - passage exponents are of order one .",
    "for example , for the rank problem the scaling behavior implies that the rank should be measured in percentiles .",
    "first - passage processes are inherently nonequilibrium . by definition",
    "the particle trajectory is restricted to certain regions in space whereas other regions are strictly excluded .",
    "for example , in the corner geometry an unrestricted brownian particle visits all eight `` quadrants '' with equal probabilities @xmath297 . yet , for first - passage processes inside a three - dimensional corner , we have @xmath298 inside the corner and @xmath299 otherwise . by exploiting the cone geometry , we have shown that the equilibrium probabilities and translate into knowledge of nonequilibrium properties , and in particular , first - passage exponents .",
    "interestingly , geometrical properties allow us to deduce exact nonequilibrium properties of a particle system from its equilibrium properties .",
    "it will be interesting to extend these results to other geometries @xcite and to establish connections with other problems involving ordering of brownian particles ."
