    "since its inception @xcite the thermodynamical interpretation of black holes ( bh ) has been the subject of debate @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mathematical analogy between the laws of thermodynamics and black hole physics following from classical general relativity still escapes a complete and satisfactory interpretation .",
    "in particular it is not yet clear whether this analogy is merely formal or leads to an actual identification of physical quantities belonging to apparently unrelated frameworks .",
    "the difficulty is related to the very concept of entropy usually adopted in bh theory , based on boltzmann entropy , which is determined by the number @xmath1 of microscopic complexions compatible with the macroscopic state of a physical system @xmath2indeed @xmath3 does not rely on a true statistical description of physical systems , but only on the classification of the microstates of the system , quantal or classical . as a consequence ,",
    "the evaluation of @xmath3 requires the knowledge of the internal structure of the bh , a result which obviously can not be achieved in the context of a purely classical description of bh .",
    "therefore the evaluation of @xmath3 requires a consistent formulation of quantum theory of gravitation and matter @xcite .",
    "this can be based , for example , on string theory @xcite and can be conveniently tested in the framework of semiclassical gravity @xcite .",
    "a basic difficulty of quantum theories founded on the concept of boltzmann entropy , is that up not now they have not leaved up to their expectations since they have not yet achieved their primary goal , i.e. , the rigorous proof of an h - theorem and the full consistency with the second law of thermodynamics @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , estimates of the boltzmann entropy based quantum theory of gravitation @xcite and yielding @xmath5 being @xmath6 the area of the event horizon , are inconsistent from this viewpoint , since as a consequence of the bh radiation effect @xcite the radius of the bh may actually decrease .",
    "hence , the boltzmann entropy @xmath3 _ can not be interpreted _ , in a proper sense , as a physical entropy of the bh . to resolve",
    "this difficulty a modified constitutive equation for the entropy was postulated @xcite , in order to include the contribution of the matter in the bh exterior , by setting @xmath7(@xmath8 denoting the so - called _ bekenstein entropy _ ) where @xmath9 represents the correction carried by the matter outside the bh ( notice , however , that also @xmath9 can not be interpreted as entropy ) . as a consequence a generalized second law @xmath10",
    "was proposed bekenstein 1973,bekenstein 1974 which can be viewed as nothing more than the ordinary second law of thermodynamics applied to a system containing a bh .",
    "however , the precise definition and underlying statistical basis both for @xmath9 and potentially also of @xmath3 remain obscure .",
    "thus a fundamental problem appears their precise estimates based on suitable microscopic models .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one regards the bh as a classical object in the space - time continuum , provided the surrounding falling matter can be assumed as formed by a suitably large number of particles , the estimate of the bh entropy should be achievable directly in the context of classical statistical mechanics , by adopting the customary concept of statistical entropy , i.e. , gibbs entropy .",
    "in contrast to the boltzmann entropy , this is based on a statistical description of physical systems and is defined in terms of the probability distribution of the observable microstates of the system .",
    "in fact , as is well - known , its definition coincides with the axiomatic definition of shannon entropy , yielding the measure of ignorance on statistical ensembles .  a first result of this type been presented in previous work by nicolini and tessarotto @xcite ( hereon denoted as ref.i ) , where a covariant kinetic theory in the presence of an event horizon was developed for classical matter in the bh exterior , treated as a n - body system ( with @xmath11 ) of classical point particles undergoing , before capture , a purely hamiltonian dynamics . by introducing a suitable definition for the relativistic kinetic entropy of infalling classical matter described as an ensemble of point particles , an h - theorem was reached , tanking into account the presence of the black hole event horizon .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend the results of ref.i by developing a microscopic ( n - body ) statistical description of classical matter in the presence of an event horizon . for this purpose",
    "we intend to evaluate the gibbs ( microscopic ) entropy of classical matter falling into the bh event horizon .",
    "in particular , we intend to prove the validity of an exact h - theorem holding for gibbs entropy , provided the infalling matter can be described as a suitably large classical system ( @xmath11 ) of point ( neutral or charged ) particles forming plasma or a rarefied gas which interact mutually only via a mean hamiltonian field . the scheme of the presentation is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , first the basic assumptions of the theory are introduced , which include the concept of particle capture domain , assumed to be defined by a smooth hypersurface located suitably close to the event horizon ( _ capture surface _ ) .",
    "second , a covariant microscopic statistical description is formulated for a n - body system of classical point particles referred to an arbitrary observer . in particular , in the exterior domain of the bh ( outside the capture surface )",
    "the particle system is assumed to obey a hamiltonian dynamics . as a consequence , in the same domain the liouville theorem for the corresponding phase - flow",
    "is readily recovered and , based on the concept of observer - related n - particle microscopic distribution function and probability density , the relativistic n - body liouville equation is determined .",
    "finally suitable boundary conditions are introduced for the microscopic distribution function on the capture surface .    in sec .",
    "iii the definitions of observer - related relativistic gibbs and kinetic entropies for the infalling classical matter are introduced and the corresponding entropy production rates are determined .",
    "the relationship between the two entropies is proven to hold in an elementary way for classical systems of weakly interacting point particles . as a consequence",
    "the obvious physical interpretation of the contributions of the entropy production rate are pointed out .    finally , in sec .",
    "iv , an h - theorem is recovered for the gibbs entropy , extending the result of ref.i . the result is proven to hold for bh characterized by an event horizon of arbitrary shape and size .",
    "in particular , the result is proven to apply , in contrast to boltzmann entropy in quantum theory of gravitation @xcite , also to the case of matter falling in a bh with contracting event horizons , such as bh implosions or slow contractions .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic framework of the theory .",
    "the assumptions we are going to make deal with the treatment of non - isolated black hole formed by the collapse of a star and surrounded by matter .",
    "the bh , together with its associated event horizon , and of the matter surrounding the bh and falling toward the event horizon are all assumed as classical .",
    "it is sufficient for our purposes to assume the following hypotheses :    _ i ) infalling particles capture is due to the redshift phenomenon occurring near the event horizon for an arbitrary observer located far from the bh ( for example in a region where space time is asymptotically flat @xcite ) . as",
    "a result particles sufficiently close to the event horizon effectively disappear to the observer ( assumption 1 ) .",
    "_ in the sequel we shall assume that all particle capture events occurs in a subdomain , to be identified with a surface @xmath12 of the space - time ( _ capture surface _ ) , localized infinitesimally close to the event horizon .    _",
    "ii ) the total energy of infalling particles is finite in such a way that local distortions of space - time are negligible ( assumption 2 ) . _",
    "the matter outside the bh is described by a system of @xmath11 identical classical particles to be referred to an arbitrary observer @xmath13 .",
    "if we assume that the system is hamiltonian , its evolution is well known and results uniquely determined by the classical equations of motion , defined with respect to the observer @xmath13 . to this purpose",
    "let us choose @xmath13 , without loss of generality , in a region where space time is ( asymptotically ) flat , endowing it with the proper time @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is assumed to span the set @xmath15 ( observer s time axis ) .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume that the particles are points , i.e. , they are described by the 1-particle canonical states @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 ) spanning the @xmath18dimensional phase space @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the analogous treatment of particles having higher degree of freedom is straightforward .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the system , described in terms of the n - body canonical state @xmath21 is determined by a suitable relativistic hamiltonian @xmath22 , where each canonical 1-particle state @xmath23 @xmath24 results parameterized in terms of the @xmath25th particle world line arc length @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) . as a consequence , requiring that @xmath27 results a strictly monotonic function it follows that , the particle state can be also parameterized in terms of the observer s time @xmath28 therefore , the particle states are determined by the canonical equations:@xmath29 _ { \\mathbf{x}_{i } } , \\label{hamiltonian dynamics } \\\\",

    "it follow that the phase - flow defined by the mapping @xmath33 satisfies a liouville theorem , namely @xmath34 ( see appendix ) and therefore the canonical measure defining the phase space volume @xmath35 is conserved , since @xmath36 .    next , to obtain a microscopic statistical description for the n - body system we introduce the @xmath37__body microscopic distribution function for the observer _ _",

    "@xmath26 implies that the @xmath42-th particle of the system is parameterized with respect to @xmath49 , i.e. , it results functionally dependent on the proper time of the observer ; instead the constraints placed on @xmath50-velocity implies that @xmath51 must belong to the hypersurface @xmath52 of equation @xmath53 and hence @xmath54 is a tangent vector to a timelike geodesic . in the sequel",
    "we adopt also the notation @xmath55to denote @xmath56 evaluated on the intersection of the hypersurfaces @xmath57 the _ event horizon _ of a classical bh is defined by the hypersurface @xmath58identical for all particles and specified by the equation @xmath59where for @xmath60 @xmath61 denotes the a suitable curvilinear coordinate for the @xmath62-th particle and coincides with the radial coordinate in the spherically symmetric case . according to a classical point of view ,",
    "let us now assume that the particle capture surface be defined by the surface @xmath12 of equation @xmath63where @xmath64 , while @xmath65 is an infinitesimal which may depend on explicit or hidden parameters ( for example , @xmath66 might depend on the detector used by the observer ) .",
    "the presence of the bh event horizon is taken into account by defining suitable boundary conditions for the kinetic distribution function on the hypersurface @xmath12 .",
    "for this purpose we distinguish between incoming and outgoing distributions on @xmath12 with respect to the @xmath42-th particle , @xmath67 and @xmath68 corresponding respectively to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a locally radial outward @xmath72vector .",
    "therefore the boundary conditions on @xmath12 are specified as follows @xmath73as previously anticipated , these boundary conditions do not actually require the detailed physical model for the particle loss mechanism , since all particles are assumed to be captured on the same hyper - surface @xmath12 , independent of their state .",
    "this provides a classical loss model for the bh event horizon .",
    "it is now immediate to determine the covariant liouville equation which in the external domains , i.e. outside the event horizon , advances in time the microscopic distribution function  @xmath74 with respect to the observer @xmath75 thanks to liouville theorem ( i.e. , phase - space volume conservation in @xmath76 in the sense indicated above ) and invoking as usual the axiom of conservation of probability for classical systems , it follows that @xmath77 must satisfies the differential liouville equation @xmath78where by assumption @xmath79is made for all @xmath80 and the summation is understood over repeated indexes .",
    "this equation resumes the conservation of the probability in the relativistic phase space in the domain external to the event horizon . invoking the hamiltonian dynamics ( [ hamiltonian dynamics ] )",
    ", the kinetic equation takes the conservative form @xmath81 _ { \\mathbf{x}_{i}}=0.\\]]let us now introduce the assumption , holding for collisionless of weakly interacting particles , either neutral or charged , that the hamiltonian @xmath82 can be expressed in the form@xmath83where @xmath84 this implies that the particles of the @xmath47-body system interact mutually only via a mean - field hamiltonian force .",
    "it follows that the liouville equation ( [ liouville equation ] ) admits the factorized solution@xmath85where @xmath86 is the kinetic ( 1-particle ) probability density and @xmath87 is the related kinetic distribution function , which manifestly obeys the covariant kinetic equation of the form nicolini2005a , tessarotto2004@xmath88 _ { \\mathbf{x}_{i}}=0.\\ ] ] notice that this equation is independent of @xmath47 , the number of particles , to be assumed in the sequel as finite .",
    "let us now introduce the definition for the microscopic entropy @xmath89 appropriate in the context of the present covariant theory .",
    "the definition follows by straightforward generalization of the relativistic kinetic entropy @xcite and the concept of gibbs entropy in non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic teubner 1961,israel 1963,de groot 1980 statistical mechanics .",
    "thus the concept of gibbs microscopic entropy can be defined in analogy to ref .",
    "i , with respect to an observer endowed with proper time @xmath14 @xmath90here the notation is as follows : @xmath91 where for each particle @xmath92 the state vectors @xmath16 are parameterized with respect to @xmath26 , with @xmath26 denoting the @xmath93-particle arc length .",
    "finally , @xmath94 denotes the principal value of the integral introduced in order to exclude from the integration domain the subset in which the distribution function vanishes .",
    "it is immediate to obtain the relationship between gibbs and kinetic entropy , @xmath95  previously defined in ref.i and given by the equation    @xmath96    where @xmath97 denotes the 1-particle phase space . in fact the condition of factorization ( [ factorization ] ) implies immediately @xmath98the kinetic entropy can also be written in the equivalent way @xmath99where @xmath100",

    "that , in analogy to the bekenstein position ( [ beck ] ) , @xmath111and @xmath121 denote the contributions to the entropy flux carried by incoming matter and by the bh due to the motion of the event horizon , therefore they can be at least qualitatively related in the following way:@xmath122being @xmath9 and @xmath3 the contributions to bekenstein entropy ( [ beck ] ) . in particular , it interesting to remark that both @xmath111and @xmath121 _ result by construction proportional to _",
    "@xmath123 the area of the event horizon , a conclusion which appears in qualitative agreement with estimate for the bh boltzmann entropy given above for @xmath3 .",

    "in such a case , it is possible to determine the signs of @xmath124 , which contributes to the entropy production rate ( [ entro ] ) .",
    "indeed it is possible to prove that there results @xmath125 while @xmath121 has not a definite sign .",
    "in addition , thanks to the results given in the previous section , in particular the relationship between the gibbs and kinetic entropies , @xmath89 and @xmath95 specified by eq.([gibbs and kinetic entropy ] ) ,  the following h - theorem holds for  @xmath126    @xmath127    moreover , we notice that the support of the kinetic distribution function , i.e. , the subset of @xmath128 in which the kinetic distribution function is non negative , results always compact . this condition is as a direct consequence of the assumption 2 here considered , implying that the energy of the falling particles reaching the surface @xmath12 can not become infinite .",
