    "current development of quantum technologies suggests quantum entanglement as the exclusive resource for many potential applications , such as quantum teleportation , superdense coding , quantum cryptography and quantum computing @xcite . however , apart from entanglement generation @xcite and detection @xcite , successful practical utilization of entanglement - based quantum technologies demands efficient protocols for entanglement protection from detrimental environmental influence @xcite and its recovery after a possible partial loss @xcite .",
    "the construction of the protocols , in turn , requires exact methods for entanglement quantitative description as well as clear understanding of the fundamental laws of the entanglement evolution .",
    "the lack of accurate entanglement measure for multipartite entangled systems @xcite imposes serious limitations on our ability to describe complex entanglement dynamics .",
    "therefore , any realistic situation , when the description of the entanglement evolution of a multipartite quantum system can be simplified , is of great practical importance .",
    "an important example of such a simplified description of complex entanglement dynamics was given by konrad @xcite .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that the entanglement evolution of an arbitrary pure two - qubit state can be completely described by two factors , which are given by the initial entanglement of the pure state and the entanglement dynamics of the maximally entangled state .",
    "subsequently , this result has been extended to the cases of high - dimensional bipartite systems @xcite , mixed initial states @xcite and multiqubit systems @xcite .",
    "all these results , however , were obtained under assumption that just one subsystem of the entangled system undergoes the action of an environmental channel ( i.e. the system is affected by a single - sided channel ) . in practice , however , it is often required to distribute parts of an entangled system between several remote recipients @xcite . in this case , each subsystem is coupled locally with some environmental channel , i.e. the quantum system is the subject of many - sided channels .",
    "recently , we analyzed the entanglement dynamics of initially pure three - qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , when each qubit is simultaneously affected by a noisy channel @xcite .",
    "we showed that , in some cases , the entanglement dynamics of the three - qubit system in many - sided channels can be completely described by factors , which represent the evolution of the entangled system in single - sided channels .",
    "similar result has been independently obtained by man @xcite for generalized multiqubit ghz states . moreover , using so - called g - concurrence @xcite as the entanglement measure , gheorghiu and gour @xcite have recently shown that the average loss of entanglement induced by many - sided local channels is independent on the initial state and is completely defined by the local channels .    in this paper , we analyze the entanglement evolution of two- , three- and four - qubit systems affected by local many - sided channels . using wootter s concurrence @xcite for two qubits and its extension to higher dimensions @xcite for multiqubit systems , we show that , for low - rank density matrices of the final state , such a complex entanglement dynamics can be completely described by factors representing single - sided entanglement dynamics of the initial state . for two qubits , in particular ,",
    "we show that the above factorization can be achieved , if the rank of the final state density matrix is two . for multiqubit systems , in contrast , the factorization is possible for density matrices with rank no higher then four . on analytical examples and by numerical simulations",
    "we show that the factorization is independent on , as far as the above rank conditions are fulfilled . since it is generally difficult to generate a low rank final state density matrix out of an arbitrary initial multiqubit state , for three and four qubit systems , we that the initial state is a maximally entangled state , either ghz or w state .",
    "the symmetry of the initial states allows us generating final state density matrices with all possible ranks    this work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall briefly describe the entanglement measures of use and introduce the quantum operation formalism @xcite that allows us to access the state dynamics of quantum systems under the action of local noisy channels . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fac ] we step - by - step analyze the entanglement dynamics of two- , three- and four - qubit systems affected by local many - sided channels and show examples when such a complex entanglement dynamics can be factorized on terms representing single - sided entanglement evolution .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] with a summary of our results and a discussion of their possible implications to theoretical and experimental description of the entanglement dynamics .",
    "it has been found difficult to quantify the entanglement of mixed many - partite states , and no general solution is known @xcite apart from wootter s concurrence @xcite .",
    "the wootter s concurrence allows us to compute the entanglement of an arbitrary state of a two - qubit system , which is given by the density matrix @xmath0 , as @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 are the square roots of the four eigenvalues of the non - hermitean matrix @xmath3 , if taken in decreasing order .",
    "it is important to note that this matrix is obtained from the density matrix @xmath0 by simultaneous inversion of the single - qubit subsystems with the help of the only generator @xmath4 of the so@xmath5 group .",
    "various extensions of wootter s concurrence have been worked out over the years @xcite .",
    "ou @xcite , in particular , suggested a generalization of wootter s concurrence for bipartite states , if the dimensions of the associated hilbert subspaces are larger than two . for a @xmath6-dimensional quantum system , this concurrence can be written as @xmath7 where each term @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 here , the @xmath10 are the square roots of the four nonvanishing eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath11 , if taken in decreasing order .",
    "these matrices @xmath12 are formed by means of the density matrix @xmath0 and its complex conjugate @xmath13 , and are further transformed by the operators @xmath14 as : @xmath15 . in this notation ,",
    "moreover , @xmath16 are @xmath17 generators of the group so@xmath18 , while the @xmath19 are the @xmath20 generators of the group so@xmath21 .",
    "although the bipartite concurrence ( [ concurence - gen ] ) reduces to wootter s concurrence for the special case of two qubits , in general it is an approximate entanglement measure , which provides limited information about entanglement of the bipartite system @xcite . while the dimensionality of the hilbert space of a two - qubit system is four , the inversion of an arbitrary state @xmath0 is unambiguously defined by the single generator of the so@xmath5 group . in higher dimensions ,",
    "however , there is no unique way to invert a given quantum state @xcite .",
    "ambiguous choice of the state inversion leads to the summation over all possible @xmath22 state inversions in eq .",
    "( [ concurence - gen ] ) in all @xmath23-dimensional subspaces of the original @xmath6-dimensional hilbert state space of the bipartite system .",
    "the main consequence of such approximation for state inversion is that there may be only four nonzero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath24 , while the other @xmath25 eigenvalues of always vanish .    in spite of the above limitations ,",
    "concurrence ( [ concurence - gen ] ) has been shown to be quite powerful measure of entanglement @xcite . using the bipartite concurrence li @xcite formulated an analytical lower bound for multiqubit concurrence , which is given by a squared sum of the bipartite concurrences computed for all possible bi - partitioning of the multiqubit system . for three qubits , in particular , the lower",
    "bound can be written in terms of the three bipartite concurrences that correspond to possible cuts of two qubits from the remaining one , i.e. @xmath26 this lower bound , moreover , has been used to describe the entanglement dynamics of three - qubit states under the action of certain multi - sided noisy channels @xcite . on particular analytical examples and by numerical simulations , it has been shown that for three - qubit density matrices with rank no higher then four , the lower bound ( [ low - bound - three ] ) provides adequate description of the entanglement evolution irrespective from system - channel coupling rate and for all times of interaction . for density matrices with higher ranks , however , the lower bound vanishes after a finite time , while the quantum states it is applied to are not separable , i.e. possess certain amount of entanglement .",
    "this behavior of the lower bound ( [ low - bound - three ] ) is not the consequence of the entanglement sudden death @xcite , but is induced by the approximate character of the bipartite concurrence ( [ concurence - gen ] ) as an entanglement measure .",
    "quantum operation formalism is a very general and prominent tool to describe how a quantum system has been influenced by its environment . according to this formalism",
    "the final state of the quantum system , that is coupled to some environmental channel , can be obtained from its initial state with the help of ( kraus ) operators @xmath27 and the condition @xmath28 is fulfilled .",
    "note that we consider only such system - environment interactions that can be associated with completely positive trace - preserving maps @xcite .",
    "if the quantum system of interest consists of just which is subjected to some environmental channel @xmath29 , then an arbitrary quantum operation associated with the channel s action can be expressed with the help of at most four operators @xcite .",
    "let us define the four operators through the pauli matrices as @xmath30   k_3(a_3 ) & = & \\frac{a_3}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{array }",

    "following standard notations @xcite , the channel with parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 is called bit flip ( bf ) ; if @xmath35 and @xmath36 the channel is called phase flip ( pf ) , while the channel with @xmath37 and @xmath38 is bit - phase flip ( bpf ) .",
    "these notations and definitions shall be used along the paper .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , our ability to simplify the description of the entanglement evolution strongly depends on the symmetries of the qubits - environment system .",
    "therefore , we shall assume that the quantum system is initially prepared in a maximally entangled state , i.e. in a bell state for two qubits and either in ghz or w state for three and four qubits .",
    "at the same time we do not impose any limitations on the single - qubit channels , apart from their representation by operators ( [ single ] ) .",
    "moreover , if in the text , for example , two single - qubit channels @xmath29 and @xmath39 are both bf channels , it is assumed that in general these channels are not equivalent , i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "suppose , each qubit of the two - qubit system , initially prepared into a bell state @xmath42 , is affected by the bf channels @xmath29 and @xmath39 .",

    "we have numerically generated channels @xmath29 and @xmath39 and confirmed that for any final density matrix with rank two , the factorization ( [ 2-q fac ] ) remains valid irrespective of the channels @xmath29 and @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast to two qubits , there are two maximally entangled states for three - qubit systems @xcite , which are typically written as @xmath48    \\label{w } & & \\ket{\\rm w_3 } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\left ( \\ket{001 } + \\ket{010 } + \\ket{100 } \\right ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the entanglement dynamics of these states in local channels can be described , for example , by the bipartite concurrence @xmath49 that correspond to the separation of two qubits of the three - qubit system from the remaining one .",
