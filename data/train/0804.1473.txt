    "markarian 501 ( mrk 501 ) is a bl lacertae ( bl lac ) object at _ z _ = 0.034 and was discovered as a @xmath0-ray source at @xmath6 350 gev by the whipple collaboration @xcite and subsequently confirmed by the hegra collaboration@xcite . in march 1997",
    "the source went into a highly variable and strong emission state with flux doubling times of less than 0.5 day @xcite .",
    "the time period of the outburst coincided with the source visibility windows of several ground - based imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( iacts ) .",
    "thus almost continuous monitoring of mrk 501 in tev @xmath0-rays was possible with several iacts ( whipple , hegra , cat , tactic ) located in the northern hemisphere and they detected an integral flux of up to roughly 10 times that from the crab nebula above 1 tev@xcite .",
    "all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) , also reported the high x - ray activity of the source which started in march 1997 and continued till october 1997 @xcite .",
    "the egret observations did not result in any detection of the source in high - energy @xmath0-ray range ( 30mev -30gev)@xcite in 1997 , though a year earlier , the same instrument had detected mrk 501 at 5.2 @xmath5 level for e@xmath10500 mev@xcite .",
    "there was an indication that the average optical u - band flux was higher in the month of the peak @xmath0-ray activity @xcite .",
    "observations of mrk 501 during 1998 - 1999 following the major 1997 outburst phase , reveal a mean emission level of @xmath11 of the crab nebula flux at 1 tev , a factor of 10 lower than the 1997 outburst .",
    "the vhe spectrum measured during this period is substantially softer ( by 0.44 @xmath12 0.1 in spectral index ) than the 1997 time - averaged spectrum @xcite .",
    "the celeste group has also detected a weak @xmath0-ray signal from mrk 501 ( 3.4@xmath13 ) using a low threshold system at themis during their 2000 observations@xcite . in 2003 - 04 hess observation of mrk 501 at large - zenith angle range for 1.8 hours , resulted in a marginal detection ( 3.1 @xmath5 ) of the source@xcite .",
    "the magic group has reported detection of two flaring episodes from the source on june 30 and july 09 , 2005 with flux values of and crab units respectively @xcite . among a number of interesting source related",
    "features this group has unveiled are the detection of the ic peak in the sed for the most active nights , flux variability increase with energy and an intriguing 4 minute shift in time ( on july 9 , 2005 ) of the higher energy flare compared to lower energies . +",
    "the tactic atmospheric cherenkov telescope is located at mt .",
    "abu ( 24.6@xmath14 n , 72.7@xmath14 e , 1300 m asl ) , a hill station in western india .",
    "it uses a tessellated light - collector of 9.5 @xmath15 area which is configured as a quasi - parabolic surface , yielding a measured spot - size of 0.3@xmath14 for on - axis parallel rays .",
    "the pc - controlled 2-axes drive system gives a pointing / tracking accuracy of better than @xmath123 arc - mins .",
    "the telescope deploys a 349-pixel , photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) based imaging camera with a uniform pixel resolution of @xmath16 0.3@xmath17 and a field of view of @xmath16 6@xmath14 @xmath1 6@xmath14 to record images of atmospheric cherenkov events produced by an incoming vhe cosmic - ray particle or a @xmath0-ray photon .",
    "present observations use the inner 225 pixels ( 15 @xmath1 15 matrix ) of the camera for the event - trigger generation , based on the nnp ( nearest neighbour pair ) topological logic .",
    "the data acquisition and control system of the telescope @xcite has been designed around a network of pcs running the qnx real - time operating system .",
    "the details of the telescope functioning are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the telescope is sensitive to @xmath0-rays above 1 tev and can detect the crab nebula at 5@xmath5 significance level in 25 hours of on source observation .",
    ".observation log for mrk 501 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         the differential energy spectrum obtained after applying the dynamic supercuts to the combined 2006 data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:501sp ] . a power law fit to the data ( @xmath7 ) in the energy range 1 - 11 tev yields @xmath8 and @xmath9 with a @xmath18 ( probability = 0.97 ) .",
    "again a low value of the reduced @xmath19 may be due to overestimation of the errors in the present measurements .",
    "the errors in the flux constant and spectral index are standard errors .",
    "we have also tried a power law with an exponential cutoff function of the form ( @xmath20 while fitting the observed source differential energy spectrum which , however , does not indicate any exponential cutoff feature in the energy range 1 - 11 tev of the source spectrum .",
    "one of the possible reasons for not having obtained exponential cutoff in the reported source energy spectrum could be the low statistics ( about 500 @xmath0-ray like events only ) detected with the tactic telescope .",
    "we have studied the bl lac object mrk 501 in vhe gamma - ray energy range with the tactic @xmath0-ray telescope during 2005- 06 .",
    "we do not find any evidence for the presence of a statistically significant vhe gamma - ray signal either in the overall data or when the data is analysed on the month to month basis or a night to night basis during 2005 observations .",
    "an upper limit of i(@xmath211 tev)@xmath22 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 28@xmath23 of the tactic detected crab nebula flux ) has been placed at a 3@xmath5 confidence level on the integrated @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "our results do not conflict with those of the magic group @xcite in 2005 as the two observations are not overlapping in time as mentioned earlier .",
    "these observations rather provide the source light curve prior to the magic detected two historical flares on june , 30 and july , 9 , 2005 .        during 2006 observations",
    "we have detected a tev @xmath0-ray signal from the source direction with a statistical significance of 7.5@xmath5 in 66.8 hours of on - source observations .",
    "monthly spellwise analysis revealed that the source was relatively brighter during ii spell of 2006 observations as its statistical significance is close to 6@xmath5 in 27.71 hours of observations .",
    "data collected during three nights of march 26 , 27 and 28 , 2006 ( mjd 53820 , 53821 and 53822 ) do reveal hourly gamma - ray rate more than two times that of the crab nebula .",
    "excesses of gamma - ray like events obtained are 37.0 @xmath12 12.7 , 41.7 @xmath12 11.7 and 56.0 @xmath12 15.5 for 1.9 , 1.7 and 2.8 hours of observations respectively .",
    "these observations possibly suggest that the source has gone into a variable active state in the vhe region during the observations of aforementioned three nights .",
    "we have measured the source differential energy spectrum which fits well with the power law function of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 with a @xmath18 ( probability = 0.97 ) in the energy range 1 - 11 tev .",
    "we do not get any evidence for an exponential cutoff like feature when we use a power law function of the form @xmath20 while fitting the observed source differential spectrum in the aforementioned tactic energy range .    in figure [",
    "fig : comp ] we compare important source related vhe spectra results obtained during different epochs by various groups , whipple @xcite , hegra @xcite , cat@xcite and magic@xcite .",
    "as is clear from this figure , tactic 2006 results closely follow those obtained by the hegra group during the period 1998 - 99 , except for the exponential cutoff feature with @xmath24 = 2.61 tev .",
    "this source along with mrk 421 is very interesting as it is the second nearest bl lac object , which has been observed in highly variable states by aforementioned groups . in order to understand such highly violent extra galactic objects",
    "it is necessary to continue monitoring them for long durations with sensitive @xmath0-ray telescopes .",
    "the authors would like to convey their gratitude to all the concerned colleagues of the astrophysical sciences division for their contributions towards the instrumentation and observation aspects of the tactic telescope .",
