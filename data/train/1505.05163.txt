    "models of opinion formation have been studied by physicists since the 80 s and are now part of the new branch of physics called sociophysics .",
    "this recent research area uses tools and concepts of statistical physics to describe some aspects of social and political behavior @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , opinion models are interesting to physicists because they present order - disorder transitions , scaling and universality , among other typical features of physical systems , which called the attention of many groups throughout the world @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient of models of opinion dynamics is conformity , an important behavior of individuals that emerges as a result of their interactions with other individuals in the population @xcite . as examples : ( i ) an individual may copy the state ( opinion ) of one of his / her neighbors ( the voter model @xcite ) , or ( ii ) he / she can consider the majority or the minority opinion inside a small group ( the majority - rule models @xcite ) , or ( iii ) a given pair of individuals interact throught kinetic exchanges like an ideal gas @xcite . among these models ,",
    "we highlight the galam s majority - rule model @xcite",
    ". indeed , influence of majority opinions against minorities have been studied by social scientists since the 50 s @xcite .    however , recently the impact of nonconformity in opinion dynamics has attracted attention of physicists @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of nonconformity , namely anticonformity and independence @xcite , and it is important to distinguish between them .",
    "the anticonformists are similar to conformists , since both take cognizance of the group norm .",
    "thus , conformists agree with the norm , anticonformists disagree .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , an anticonformist actively rebels against influence .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the galam s contrarians @xcite , individuals that known the opinion of the individuals in a group of discussion , and adopt the choice opposite to the prevailing choice of the others , whatever this choice is . on the other hand",
    ", we have the independent behavior . in this case , the agent also take cognizance of the group norm , but he / she decides to take one of the possible opinions independently of the majority or the minority opinion in the group @xcite . as stated by willis in @xcite , _ `` the completely independent person may happen to behave in ways which are prescribed or proscribed by the norms of his group , but this is incidental .",
    "it should also be noted that pure anticonformity behavior , like pure conformity behavior , is pure dependent behavior''_.    in terms of the statistical physics of opinion dynamics , independence acts on an opinion model as a kind of stochastic driving that can lead the model to undergo a phase transition @xcite . in fact , independence plays the role of a random noise similar to social temperature @xcite . finally , another interesting and realistic kind of social behavior is usually called inflexibility .",
    "individuals with such characteristic are averse to change their opinions , and the presence of those agents in the population affects considerably the opinion dynamics @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , the introduction of inflexible agents works in the model as the introduction of a quenched disorder , due to the frozen character of the opinions of such agents .    in this work",
    "we study the effects of conformity and nonconformity in opinion dynamics . for this purpose",
    ", we consider groups of 3 or 5 agents that can interact through the majority rule , but with the inclusion of disorder ( inflexibility ) and/or noise ( independence ) .",
    "we analyze these effects separately in the standard majority - rule model , and all together , in order to study the critical behavior of the system induced by the mentioned effects .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present separately in three subsections the microscopic rules that define the distinct formulations of the model , as well as the numerical results .",
    "these numerical results are connected with the analytical considerations presented in the appendix .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section iii .",
    "our model is based on the galam s majority - rule model @xcite .",
    "we consider a fully - connected population of @xmath0 agents with opinions @xmath1 or @xmath2 concerning a given subject . in this sense",
    ", we are considering a mean - field - like limit , since each agent can interact with all others . in this case , the microscopic dynamics disregards correlations , that will be taken into account after , when we will consider the model on regular lattices .",
    "the opinions are represented by ising - like variables @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and the initial concentration of each opinion is @xmath5 ( disordered state ) .",
    "we will consider three distinct mechanisms in the formulation of our model , namely majority - rule dynamics , inflexibility and independence .",
    "our objective is to analyze the critical behavior of the system , and in this case we will consider separately in the following subsections three distinct cases : ( i ) the majority - rule model with independent behavior , ( ii ) the majority - rule model with inflexible agents , and ( iii ) the majority - rule model with inflexible and independent individuals .      in this case",
    ", we consider that some individuals in the population can show a nonconformist behavior called independence @xcite .",
    "the following microscopic rules govern the dynamics :    1 .",
    "a group of @xmath6 agents , say @xmath7 , is randomly chosen ; 2 .   with probability @xmath8",
    "all the three agents in the group will act independently of the opinions of the group s individuals , i.e. , independent of the majority / minority opinion inside the group . in this case , with probability @xmath9 all the three agents flip their opinions and with probability @xmath10 nothing occurs ; 3 .   on the other hand , with probability @xmath11",
    "the group follows the standard majority rule . in this case",
    ", all agents in the group follow the local majority opinion ( if the opinion of one agent is different from the other two , the former flips alone ) .    in the case where the 3 agents do not act independently , which occurs with probability @xmath11 , the change of the states of the agents inside the group will occur according to the galam s majority - rule model @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 can be related to the agents flexibility @xcite . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", independence is a kind of nonconformity , and it acts on an opinion model as a kind of stochastic driving that can lead the model to undergo a phase transition .",
    "in fact , independence plays the role of a random noise similar to social temperature @xcite .",
    "we analyze the critical behavior of the system , in analogy to magnetic spin systems , by computing the order parameter @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for time averages taken in the steady state .",
    "in addition to the time average , we have also considered configurational averages , i.e. , averages over different realizations .",
    "the order parameter @xmath14 is sensitive to the unbalance between the two distinct opinions , and it plays the role of the `` magnetization per spin '' in magnetic systems .",
    "in addition , we also consider the fluctuations @xmath15 of the order parameter ( or `` susceptibility '' ) @xmath16 and the binder cumulant @xmath17 , defined as @xcite @xmath18    as we are considering a mean - field formulation of the model , one can follow refs .",

    "there is a coexistence of both opinions @xmath74 , but one of them is a majority in the population .",
    "we observed that the larger the flexibility @xmath9 ( nonconservative societies ) , the smaller the value of @xmath8 needed to disorder the system .",
    "in other words , for a population debating a subject with two distinct choices , it is easier to reach a final decision for a small flexibility concerning the independent behavior , as observed in conservative societies .",

    "in addition , simulations on 1d lattices suggest the absence of a phase transition .",
    "all those results suggest the majority - rule model with independence is in the ising model universality class .",

    "we showed that there is a critical fraction @xmath63 above which there is no order in the system , i.e. , there is no decision or majority opinion .",
    "this order - disorder phase transition is also in the universality class of the mean - field ising model .",
    "we observed consensus in the population only in the absence of inflexible agents , i.e. , for @xmath71 .",
    "in other words , the presence of intrasigents in the population makes the model more realistic , since there is a clear decision in the public debate for @xmath79 . again , as a test for the universality of the model , we simulated it on triangular and square lattices . in this case , we did not observe a phase transition for both lattices , suggesting that the model with quenched disorder does not undergo a phase transition in small dimensions like @xmath65 .    finally , we considered both effects , independence and inflexibility , in the majority - rule model . in this case",
    "we also observed a phase transition at mean - field level , and the critical points @xmath31 depend on @xmath9 and @xmath57 .",
    "consensus states were only obtained for @xmath80 , and the critical exponents are the same as observed before , i.e. , we found again the universality class of the mean - field ising model . from the phase diagram of this formulation of the model we observed that the increase of the flexibility parameter @xmath9 , related to the independent behavior , makes the ordered phase smaller .",
    "it was recently discussed that the majority - rule model with limited persuasion can lead to the victory of the initial minority , provided it is sufficiently small @xcite .",
