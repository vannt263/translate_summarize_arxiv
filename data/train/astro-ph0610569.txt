    "cohen & green ( 2001 : hereafter cg ) made a detailed comparison of mir and radio continuum imaging of hii regions in an 8  deg@xmath5 galactic field centred near @xmath6 . using 8.3-@xmath0 m images from the survey of the galactic plane by the midcourse space experiment ( msx : price et al .",
    "2001 ) and 843-mhz continuum maps from the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most : green et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) , cg developed a ratio of spatially integrated mir to radio flux densities that discriminates between objects with thermal and nonthermal radio emission .",
    "this field was first explored at 843  mhz by whiteoak , cram & large ( 1994 : hereafter wcl ) who characterized the emission of sources on all scales as thermal or nonthermal .",
    "the inventory of this region is diverse .",
    "wcl and cg list more than fifty thermal sources , ranging from compact hii regions to filaments extending over 1@xmath1 in length .",
    "only about one third of the objects were detected in the recombination line survey of caswell & haynes ( 1987 ) .",
    "very few lie at tangent points so that no distance estimates , or only ambiguous ones , exist for most of the sources .",
    "the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( werner et al . 2004 : hereafter sst ) glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ) program ( benjamin et al .",
    "2003 ; churchwell et al .",
    "2004 ) has surveyed 220  deg@xmath5 of the plane in all four bands of the infrared array camera ( _ irac _ : fazio et al .",
    "glimpse images of the plane are roughly 1000 times deeper , and have an areal resolution of order 100 times smaller , than those of msx .",
    "the sst offers the prospect of exploring faint structure unseen by msx .",
    "this study has several different objectives .",
    "all are achievable by combining radio and mir continuum surveys of hundreds to thousands of square degrees of the galactic plane having the best resolutions currently available for such panoramic coverage .",
    "_ spitzer _ provides glimpse images of limited portions of the plane at high spatial resolution .",
    "first , we quantitatively investigate the diffuse calibration of _ irac _ using the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) that envelop thermal radio regions .",
    "our purpose is to attempt to link _ irac _",
    "8.0-@xmath0 m diffuse calibration to that achieved by msx and validated absolutely to @xmath71percent by price et al .",
    "absolute calibration was a vital activity on msx , which had both point source and diffuse calibrations .",
    "spatially integrating images of point sources and comparing those results with the msx point source catalogs shows these two calibrations are consistent .",
    "therefore , msx serves as a benchmark .",
    "secondly , we confirm cg s median ratio of msx8.3-@xmath0 m to 843-mhz flux densities , @xmath8 , for thermal emission , using a broader assessment of sky background than cg used , and investigate whether this discriminant varies with the density , angular scale , and morphology of thermal radio sources .",
    "thirdly , we extend the msx / radio discriminant between thermal and nonthermal radio emission to the equivalent _ irac_8.0-@xmath0 m ratio , after allowance for the different radiance contributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in these two different filters .",
    "fourthly , we examine _ irac _ images of compact hii regions looking for evidence of mir proxies for the weakly ionized radio haloes created by the leakage of photons from the dense cores .",
    "this phenomenon was proposed to explain the existence of extended radio continuum emission associated with ultracompact hii regions ( e.g. kurtz et al .",
    "fifth , we compare the mir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of hii regions in the field . finally , we note that there are other radio structures in the field that have faint mir counterparts that were not recognized by msx because of its poorer resolution .",
    "one example is the optically invisible planetary nebula png313.3 + 00.3 , well - detected by glimpse ( cohen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we draw attention to another particularly interesting object and demonstrate that it too is a thermal radio emitter .",
    " 2 introduces the theme of the absolute calibration of _ irac _ , explaining the origin of the differences between point source and diffuse calibration . in  3 we detail the 43 thermal objects studied by cg ( eliminating all sources known to be galaxies or to have nonthermal radio spectra ) . in ",
    "4 we describe our methods for assessing spatially integrated fluxes in mir and radio images , and compare msx8.3-@xmath0 m integrated fluxes with the equivalent _",

    " 5 uses these sst / msx ratios to probe the diffuse calibration of _ irac _ based on mir spectra of our target hii regions .",
    " 6 discusses the seds among the population of hii regions in this field , expressed through their irac colours .",
    " 7 details an improved set of ratios of msx8.3-@xmath0 m to most 843-mhz flux densities and provides the corresponding ratios constructed using the current calibration for glimpse 8.0-@xmath0 m image products .",
    "statistical regression analyses are also given .",
    " 8 illustrates _ irac _ imagery of some of the regions studied , highlighting similarities and differences between mir and radio morphologies .",
    " 9 presents a curious thermal object with unique characteristics .",
    " 10 provides a mir / radio ratio for five galaxies and one supernova remnant ( snr ) lying within this field , to illustrate the difficulty of measuring the mir emission of snrs even with the sst , but also to provide a quantitative estimate of the mir / radio ratio for nonthermal emitters .

    "the basis of _ irac _ s absolute calibration is identical to the network of fiducial standards built by cohen et al .",

    "this calibration has been validated absolutely by price et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to 1.0percent . to support calibration with the high sensitivity of _ irac _ required the development of new techniques and the establishment of faint optical - to - ir calibrators ( cohen et al .",
    "_ irac _ standards are either k0-m0iii or a0 - 5v stars .",
    "the former are stellar supertemplates ( uv - optical versions of the original cool giant templates of cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) .",
    "the latter are represented by kurucz photospheric spectra .",
    "these stars underpin the calibration of _ irac _ and provide cross - calibration pairwise between the three instruments of the sst .",
    "the primary _ irac _ suite consists of 11 stars near the north ecliptic pole , but a secondary network close to the ecliptic plane offers efficient checks of calibration every 12hr after _ irac _ data are downlinked . reach et al .",
    "( 2005 ) express their preference for the a - stars and it is these that provide the fundamental parameters that are embedded in the header of each item of basic calibrated data ( bcd ) from the sst .",

    "( 2004 ) , reach et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and in the _ irac _ data handbook ( version 3.0 , available from the ssc . )",
    "calibration of point sources is achieved by performing aperture photometry on bcd images , in a 10-pixel ( 12.2@xmath9 ) radius aperture , and comparing with observations of the _ irac _ standards using the same process , aperture size , and sky annulus .",
    "treating bcd images in this fashion results in consistent , well - calibrated , point source photometry that traces to msx ( cohen et al .",
    "it had been assumed before the launch of the sst that the extended emission calibration for _ irac _ could be derived from the point source calibration .",
    "several tasks were planned to check the accuracy of the extended source calibration , but only after launch was it determined that the responsivity to point source emission was lower than expected , and that differences existed between point source and extended source calibration , consistent with internal scattering of the light in the _ irac _ arrays . as a consequence , extended emission will not be correctly calibrated and must be corrected to the  infinite aperture \" limit by multiplying by wavelength - dependent  effective aperture correction \" factors .",
    "the factor advocated for _ irac _ extended sources at 8.0@xmath0 m is 0.737 ( irac data handbook , table 5.7 ; reach et al .",
    "the recommended factors for _ irac _ s three shorter wavelength bands are 0.944 , 0.937 , 0.772 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8@xmath0 m , respectively . in this paper",
    "we investigate the correction factor at 8.0@xmath0 m by an independent approach .",
    "table  1 lists the thermal radio objects in the wcl study of the field .",
    "thirteen sources listed by cg were excluded from our primary analysis , eleven of them nonthermal emission regions : five galaxies , four known snr , a further two nonthermal radio sources ( one of them mixed inextricably with thermal emission ) , one source of unknown nature that is surely dominated by thermal dust emission ( g313.28@xmath100.33 ) , and the source g311.31 + 0.60 ( which is a misnomer by wcl for g311.42 + 0.60 and appears in cg as a duplicate of this latter source s entry .",
    "g310.80@xmath100.38 can not be isolated unambiguously in the complex _ spitzer _",
    "we have also inserted one new source , g311.70 + 0.31 , of particular interest because of its unique morphology (  9 ) .",
    "we initially adopted the source character ( e.g. classical , compact , filamentary , etc . ) from wcl .",
    "however , these attributes were drawn from heterogeneous literature so we decided to re - examine the molonglo data for every source and have assigned our own homogeneous radio types to the sample .",
    "these are indicated in table  1 ( col.(3 ) ) , as are wcl s radio dimensions in arcmin ( col.(2 ) : galactic longitude by latitude ) .",
    "columns ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) respectively present the observed ratios of the _",
    "irac_8.0-@xmath0 m to msx8.3-@xmath0 m flux densities , and of the msx8.3-@xmath0 m and _ irac_8.0-@xmath0 m flux densities to those at 843  mhz .",
    "uncertainties are given for each ratio ( 1@xmath11 ) based upon the root - sum - square ( rss ) of the fractional errors in the pairs of flux densities .",
    "column ( 8) gives the areally integrated 8.0-@xmath0 m sst fluxes in mjy . column ( 9 ) gives figure numbers for objects represented by images .",
    "sst offers mir images with far higher spatial resolution than those of currently available panoramic radio surveys .",
    "therefore , we have also developed a mir morphology based on the _ irac _ images ( some of which are presented in  8) , which appears in col.(4 ) of table  1 .",
    "note that g311.64 + 0.97 , a bubble some 35@xmath330 arcmin , extends beyond the northern latitude coverage of glimpse .",
    "for the calculations in this paper we have used the brightest portion that can be accommodated by the glimpse latitude limit , namely the 6@xmath314 arcmin eastern filament centred at ( 311.88@xmath1,1.01@xmath1 ) .    for convenience",
    "we have ordered sources in table  1 by longitude . to render the table more readable",
    "we have selected a small number of morphological descriptors that are coded by their leading letters . in the most radio continuum",
    "these are : c - compact ; s - shell ( curved morphologies ) ; b - blob ( lacking any specific structure but larger than a compact or unresolved source ; and f - filamentary .",
    "the _ irac _",
    "descriptors are : uc - ultracompact ; c - compact ; s - shell ; d - diffuse ; f - filamentary . however , it was necessary to add a second ( lower - case ) letter to signify secondary characteristics recognizable in the detailed imagery .",
    "these extra qualifiers are : c - compact ; m - multiple ( when multiple compact cores occur within a source ; s - shell ; f - filaments present ; h - halo ; i - objects that are apparently in close enough physical proximity to be interacting .    the scheme we have adopted , based on glimpse , must clearly represent those characteristics that are detected in this particular survey .",
    "a deeper survey might well be expected to discover fainter features unknown from glimpse . a future change in pipeline , or in our understanding of diffuse calibration ,",
    "could readily alter underlying background levels and local brightnesses , thereby affecting areal integrations of specific parts of an hii region .",
    "similarly , longer exposures could reveal fainter structures that , at glimpse s depth , appear separate and distinct but , with greater depth in imaging , are found to be connected by filaments or to be merely small portions of widespread faint haloes .",
    "therefore , we rejected the ratio of components integrated fluxes as the determining factor for morphological types",
    ". instead we have assigned types by ranking the highest surface brightnesses found in continuous topological elements in residual images , typically at 8.0@xmath0 m .",
    "for example , fig .",

    "the highest surface brightness pixels occur in the very bright central core .",
    "the second highest levels are found in the small , complete rings north of the bright core , and the third in the long , curving filament that emerges to the north - west from the core , looping around to the north and almost reaching the brighter of the two small rings inside the large , faint oval shell .",
    "hence ,  cs \" is our designation .",
    "tertiary characteristics are not given for simplicity so the secondary code describes whichever aspect is brightest after the primary .",

    "these two figures retain the different symbols to identify different types of thermal region .",
    "table  2 summarizes the median analyses and regression lines for the subsamples of sources in terms of the ratios of msx to most ( centre of the table ) , and sst to most ( right section of the table ) , flux densities .",
    "there are meaningful correlations implying linear proportionality between both msx and sst 8-@xmath0 m fluxes and radio continuum fluxes .",
    "however , unlike the _ irac_/msx correlation , there are three issues which affect the mir to radio flux ratios .",
    "one expects the most to lose flux substantially as the interferometer observes larger regions . the best model for the actual synthesized beam of the most incorporates an effective minimum spacing of about 70@xmath12 ( hogan 1992 )",
    "although this parameter varies between observations and may be dependent on meridian distance . therefore , angular scales greater than about 30arcmin are typically poorly detected .",
    "this certainly affects the largest structure in the field ( the filamentary object , g312.45 + 0.08 , msx / most of 800 ) with a size greater than 1@xmath1 .",
    "it might also overestimate msx / most for the second largest source ( the diffuse g311.37 + 0.79 , msx / most of 87 ) , with a size of 24arcmin , corresponding to the second largest hii region in our whole sample . to assess the fraction of true radio continuum flux that has been measured for each specific region by the most would require detailed modeling based on the irregular structures of real sources , and on the u - v coverage obtained , like the simulations performed by bock & gaensler ( 2005 ) .",
    "we can state only that msx / most and _ irac_/most ratios are invalid for g312.45 + 0.08 but we suggest that this phenomenon may also contribute to some of the other large ratios that are found in table  2 , particularly for diffuse regions .",
    "the second concern is relevant to the single example of a cometary hii region in our sample , g312.77 + 0.06 .",
    "this appears anomalous in both figs .",
    "[ hiimsx ] and [ hiisst ] because it is quite compact yet also has a very large mir / radio ratio .",
    "we believe this object is optically thick at 843  mhz , greatly diminishing the radio continuum flux density . this would be consistent with the extremely deep 10-@xmath0 m silicate absorption whose optical depth , @xmath13(10@xmath0 m )  @xmath143 , hence a@xmath15@xmath1455 ( roche & aitken 1984 ; chiar & tielens 2006 ) , and the fact that this source has the most extreme lrs energy distribution in our sample in that it shows the deepest 18-@xmath0 m silicate absorption too .",
    "the blueness of the spectrum implies an abundance of warm ( @xmath16400  k ) dust ( rather than cool , i.e. @xmath17100  k ) local to the embedded high - mass star .",
    "consequently , this region s exciting star is enormously embedded in dust , plausibly leading to local free - free absorption from the associated dense ionized gas .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to exclude this region from any mir / radio analysis of subsamples , reducing the ultracompact and compact hii regions to 18 objects .",
    "however , samples designated as `` all '' in table  2 include this cometary region .",
    "thirdly , our sst images have been culled of point sources ( only their residuals after psf subtraction remain ) but we have no such products for msx .",
    "thus msx fluxes within the radio source rectangles could potentially still include some faint point sources although efforts were made to remove their influence .",
    "radio flux densities for big sources will suffer loss of signal because of resolving out structure as discussed above .",
    "_ spitzer _ images are so sensitive to diffuse emission at low surface brightness levels that it could be necessary to seek uncontaminated sky at greater distances from the source than for msx .",
    "this could lead to underestimated sky backgrounds , hence somewhat enlarged source fluxes for _ irac _ , and relatively reduced fluxes for msx .",
    "both effects could inflate the ratio of _ irac_/most .",
    "consequently , we chose matching sky regions for both _ irac _ and msx to mitigate this problem . our best estimate for these ratios will clearly come from the sample of the 18 most compact entities , excluding the cometary source .",
    "from this set we find msx / most has a median of 25@xmath25 , in excellent accord with cg s median of 24 .",
    "the corresponding empirical ratio ( i.e. with no flux correction factor applied ) for sst is 36@xmath213 .",
    "figures  [ msxmedtyp ] and [ msxdim ] seek correlations between mir / radio flux densities and the type of hii region , and its characteristic size , respectively .",
    "these figures are derived from the data presented in table  2 .",
    "it is sufficient to explore any trend with the ratio msx / most , because we know sst and msx fluxes are linearly correlated .",
    "a weak trend toward larger median ratios in less compact sources is suggested by fig .",
    "[ msxmedtyp ] and explored in fig .  [ msxdim ] in which we have attempted to quantify the size of the different morphology types , using the square root of the median of the areas in each category . for ultracompact and compact regions we have measured the full width at half maximum ( above the surrounding sky ) of the bright cores at 8.0@xmath0 m and have used this as the characteristic dimension for these objects .",
    "the median size of these 18 compact regions is 25@xmath24arcsec ( standard error of the median ) , or 0.42arcmin .",
    "the 15 regions whose ratio of msx / most exceeds the median plus 3 standard errors of the median ( a value of 40 ) consist of 3 compact , 2 shell , 7 diffuse , and 2 filamentary sources ( excluding the self - absorbed g312.77 + 0.06 ) .",
    "each of these 3 compact regions also contains filaments , or shell structure or has a mir halo .",
    "therefore , this trend probably reflects the onset of the loss of radio signal with increasing apparent size .",
    "it might instead indicate that compact regions other than g312.77 + 0.06 are dense enough to suffer self - absorption of free - free emission .",
    "alternatively the trend might arise because the high density of dust in physically small sources leads to stronger mir thermal continuum emission at the expense of fluorescent pah bands .",
    "however , this would also increase the dust emission from small grains ( pah clusters with hundreds of carbon atoms ) observed as a broad plateau of emission in the 8.0-@xmath0 m _ irac _ band , underlying the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.7-@xmath0 m bands .",
    "this would offset some of the lost pah emission .",
    "detailed modeling of specific regions is required to explore this alternative hypothesis , incorporating both the formation and destruction rates of pahs and small grains , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "there is significant scatter in figs .",
    "[ hiimsx ] and [ hiisst ] but one might have predicted even more than is observed because variations in excitation parameter and in 843-mhz optical depth from source to source would affect the radio spectral shape and turnover frequency .",
    "however , as cg concluded , most of the hii regions in this field are not optically thick at 843mhz ; even the compact regions . the very fact",
    "that most detected so many regions argues that the old criterion , that below 1ghz hii regions are optically thick , is not sufficient . the general absence of optically thick regions at 843mhz in the _ l_=312@xmath1 field is also borne out by figs .",
    "[ msxmedtyp ] and [ msxdim ] .",
    "the small mir / radio ratios among compact objects implies there is little loss of 843-mhz signal . by comparison with the median of 25 for msx",
    "/ most for compact regions plotted in these figures , the cometary g312.77 + 0.06 has a ratio of 250 , illustrating plausibly how these ratios would be affected by significant optical depth .    among the many hii regions in this field",
    "is one object that would be defined as ultracompact , namely g310.69@xmath100.31 .",
    "the sst 8.0-@xmath0 m image has all the characteristics of a minimally resolved bright source ; a size between 1.5@xmath9 and 2@xmath9 ( slightly in excess of the point spread function s fwhm ) and the hexagonal pattern of sst diffraction spikes .",
    "the residual image ( with the suitably scaled psf subtracted ) shows a central hole at the core but has a saturated ring immediately around this hole to a radius of roughly 1@xmath9 .",
    "its ratio of _",
    "irac_/msx is 1.16@xmath20.08 , exactly as predicted for a source with the sed of an hii region that we have presented in fig .",
    "[ diffcfn ] .",
    "this result also confirms that _ irac _ photometry of a region dominated by a pointlike core ( although we can not exclude the existence of a very faint halo of emission ) is essentially correctly assessed .",
    "inspection of the basic calibrated data images sugests that the object is at or near saturation at 8.0@xmath0 m , but not severely saturated .",
    "therefore , we believe there is no major loss of flux in integrating its image and the _ irac_/msx ratio is credible . however , the source is too faint to have been detected by the lrs instrument .",
    "the ratios of both msx / most ( 5 ) and _ irac_/most ( 6 ) are the lowest of any source in table  1 , perhaps because dust competes more effectively for stellar uv photons than do pahs .",
    "we present monochrome sst images of twelve objects that span the range of mir morphologies of hii regions in this field .",
    "these are chosen to highlight the structural mir characteristics that can be associated with various radio types . although the printed paper presents black and white renditions of the _ irac _ images , the electronic version shows them as 3-colour pictures in which 4.5-@xmath0 m ( blue ) , 5.8-@xmath0 m ( green ) , and 8.0-@xmath0 m ( red ) images have been combined .",
    "our reasons for this particular trio are as follows .",
    "firstly , 3.6@xmath0 m shows too many stars and clutters the diffuse structure .",
    "msx was often unable to provide the requisite confirmation of pahs by the test of matching morphologies in its 8.3 and 12.1-um bands ( both of which include pah band emission ) because the sensitivities of all its other bands were so much lower than that of the 8.3-@xmath0 m band .",
    "by contrast , _ irac _ offers two sensitive bands capable of sampling pah emission . in order to confirm the existence of pahs , that are widely believed to be the dominant spectral features in diffuse hii regions",
    ", we wished to see the same morphology emerge in _",
    "s 5.8 and 8.0-@xmath0 m bands .",
    "one can also seek subtle changes in pah populations through spatial variations in intensity ratios or , equivalently , in false colour across regions .",
    "for example , pah emission from pdrs generally appears yellow or orange in our false - colour gallery because both 5.8 and 8.0-@xmath0 m bands contain comparably strong fluorescent pah emission features . with _ irac _",
    "we still have a probe for h@xmath18 lines through the 4.5-@xmath0 m band too .",
    "although colour differences across a single hii region have relative significance , note that variations between colour images of different regions do not necessarily indicate any spectral differences between the objects .",

    "the mir appearance of the cometary region in our sample ( g312.77 + 0.06 , ch : fig .",

    "some are well separated from the surrounding ism ( g311.42 + 0.60 , cs : fig .",
    "[ 31142 ] ) , but there are often associated multiple centres of emission , intersecting filaments ( g311.59@xmath100.59 , cf : fig .",

    "g310.89 + 0.01 ( cs : fig .",

    "g312.60 + 0.06 , ( ch : fig .",
    "[ 31260 ] ) is a particularly clear case of a halo around a compact source .",
    "it is associated with a small white core ( implying mir thermal continuum ) but it is flanked by quite extensive and relatively bright diffuse emission . the haloes could be emitting in pah bands , h@xmath18 lines or simply be due to continuum from warm ( @xmath7350k ) dust grains heated by starlight .",
    "the cores of compact hii regions are generally yellow ( pahs ) but some are white , indicative of the role played by thermal emission from hot dust rather than pahs or any specific fine structure or h@xmath18 emission lines .",
    "most shell - type hii regions consist of bounded ionized zones in the radio and in h@xmath20 emission .",
    "their mir counterparts are filamentary pdrs that enclose the ionized gas .",
    "some may include dominant , bright cores ( g311.48 + 0.37 , cs : fig .",
    "[ 31148 ] ) .",
    "our sample contains relatively few shell sources .",
    "g312.68 + 0.04 ( type si : fig .",
    "[ 31268 ] ) is the north - western of a pair of interacting bubbles .",
    "the second object is g312.71 + 0.02 ( si ) , south - east of the bright pdr that arises from the interaction of the shells blown by the winds from the two exciting stars .",
    "the odd structure , g312.67@xmath100.12 ( s ) ( fig .  [ 31267 ] ) consists of a bundle of filaments with contiguous diffuse emission , suggestive of a partial shell . as noted by cg , even at the resolution of msx , the shell comprising the pdr of g310.99 + 0.42 ( s : fig .",
    "[ 31099 ] ) is entirely composed of overlapping filaments .",
    "these are very well shown at the higher resolution of sst ( see also fig .  [ mira1 ] ) .",
    "diffuse regions are the second most numerous morphology in the mir .",
    "truly diffuse emission ( no filaments , shell , or core ) is associated with g311.50@xmath100.48 ( type d : fig .  [ 31150 ] ) .",
    "most of their mir emission is diffuse and purple , a colour that might indicate that h@xmath18 lines dominate both the 4.5 and 8.0-@xmath0 m bands . its _ iras _ lrs spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ lrs ] ) is both too noisy and at too poor a spectral resolution to be capable of showing any of these molecular lines .",
    "diffuse regions may contain filaments , such as g313.07 + 0.32 ( df : fig .  [",
    "31307 ] ) .",
    "its mir emission is red because it is detected only at 8.0-@xmath0 m .",
    "[ 31307 ] is a fine example of an object with so much diffuse pah emission that it would be almost impossible to determine where the real sky background occurs within this box , in order to set it to a black level .",
    "g312.45 + 0.08 ( fig .",
    "[ 31245 ] ) is a spectacular network of filaments over 1@xmath1 in length , containing a pair of braided filaments as if two very large bubbles have come into contact without disruption .",
    "the interaction is apparently not vigorous but has led to a warping of the interface between them ( cg ) .",
    "hii regions with compact mir morphology all have compact ( or ultracompact ) radio morphology .",
    "filamentary mir regions are likewise filamentary radio regions .",
    "but shells and diffuse regions show no unique relationship between radio and mir morphologies , most likely because the resolution of the sst is so much higher than that of the most , but also because pahs arise in the neutral zones that surround hii regions , giving them complementary , rather than identical , structures .",
    "sst s high resolution implies that one could characterize hii regions solely using their mir structure .",
    "kurtz et al . ( 1999 ) demonstrated that , in the sample of 15 hii regions they studied in the radio continuum , extended emission is found in 12 objects .",
    "the dynamic range required to detect these haloes can be assessed from their maps given that their contour levels correspond to factors of 2 , the lowest levels are given , as are the rms noise values in their very large array ( vla ) maps .",
    "typical dynamic ranges are between 60 and 500 , calculated as the ratio between the compact peak level and the 3 - 4 rms contour .",
    "the integrated extended emission in a 5arcmin square centred on the compact components ranges from 1 to 15 times that of the peak intensity , in those objects for which kurtz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) regard a physical association between halo and compact sources to be possible .",
    "one third ( six regions ) of our mir compact sources show extended emission . the dynamic range in surface brightness from each 8.0-@xmath0 m peak to the faintest extended emission clearly detected with _ irac _ ( all quantities are measured above the sky emission ) ranges from 8 to 50 .",
    "the integrated 8.0-@xmath0 m brightness of these haloes , compared with a point source matched to the compact peaks surface brightness levels , lies between 10 and 140 .",
    "thus , the mir dynamic range probed by the glimpse survey is about 10 times smaller than that at 3.6 cm ( the wavelength used by kurtz and his colleagues ) .",
    "if associated with the compact regions , the mir haloes would contribute 10 times more flux relative to their compact peaks than at 3.6 cm .",
    "if the mir haloes radiated thermally then the expected 843-mhz continuum from these haloes would be 36 times smaller than that seen by sst ( using our median ratio of _",
    "irac_/most without recalibration ) .",
    "the 3.6 cm radio emission would be 47 times smaller than at 8.0@xmath0 m , with the frequency dependence of the gaunt factor for a typical hii region .",
    "the average rms noise in the vla survey fields ( kurtz et al .",
    "1999 , their table  2 ) is 0.5mjybeam@xmath21 so the 3 rms level is about 1.5mjybeam@xmath21 , equivalent to 38mjysr@xmath21 at 8.0@xmath0 m .",
    "the average of the 8.0-@xmath0 m sky - subtracted halo brightnesses for the six regions with mir type  ch \" is 35@xmath210mjysr@xmath21 .",
    "therefore , glimpse at 8.0@xmath0 m provides comparable sensitivity to extended mir emission around compact hii regions to that afforded by vla surveys such as that by kurtz and colleagues .",
    "are there mir haloes akin to the extended weakly ionized radio haloes ? within the ionized gas of an hii region pahs suffer photodestruction by uv photons .",
    "if any survived , the wind of the central star would rapidly sweep them away into the pdr .",
    "allain , leach & sedlmayr ( 1996a ) have shown that small pahs ( those with fewer than 50 carbon atoms ) are destroyed by photodissociation on a timescale of a few years in those places in which the characteristic mir bands are seen , specifically for hii regions .",
    "cations and partially hydrogenated pahs may survive for only about a year ( allain , leach & sedlmayr 1996b ) because they are less stable than the parent molecules .",
    "consequently , small pahs must be made in abundance in locations in which the mir bands are emitted , for example in shocks with speeds between 50 and 200 kms@xmath21 where shattering and fragmentation create pah molecules , pah clusters , and small grains ( jones , tielens & hollenbach 1996 ) .",
    "pahs with more than 50 carbon atoms may survive the uv radiation field and even small pahs might last as long as 1000 years in the diffuse ism . therefore , pahs might exist for significant periods in extended haloes that were only weakly ionized and far from the dominant source of destructive uv photons .",
    "if all the mir halo emission were due to pahs then it would be plausible to associate weak diffuse pah emission with extended radio haloes in which low fluxes of uv photons leaking from dense ionized cores excite rather than destroy pahs .",
    "mir spectroscopy of such haloes would be definitive .",
    "fig .  [ dragon ] presents the point - source - subtracted image of a most unusual structure in this field , weakly detected by msx , but clearly present in all four _ irac _ bands .",
    "its spine consists of a series of segments that strongly suggests that a rayleigh - taylor instability might be responsible . if so then the mean wavelength of the segments is 38@xmath23@xmath9 ( standard error of the mean ) .",
    "however , lacking any estimate of distance and optical forbidden - line spectroscopy , we are unable to use this information on what is surely the fastest growing rayleigh - taylor mode to derive a consistent set of physical parameters for the nebula .",
    "843-mhz radio emission was detected by the most and is displayed by white contours over the sst 8.0-@xmath0 m image .",
    "the object s ratio of msx8.3-@xmath0 m integrated flux to that from the most at 843  mhz is 27@xmath22 , entirely consistent with thermal radio emission and pdrs associated with pahs .",
    "the presence of pahs is confirmed by the identical morphologies in the _ irac _ 5.8 and 8.0-@xmath0 m bands .",
    "the radio emission has two peaks , one within the  bay \" of mir emission to the east , and a second comparable peak west of the centre .",
    "a physical association with the east peak is morphologically stronger .",
    "if the source represented a structure blown and ionized by a stellar wind then one would expect the hot star to betray its presence by a radio continuum peak and by mir or far - infrared emission .",
    "a search of the region indicates only a single plausible external source that might be a star with a wind , namely _",
    "iras_14028@xmath106103 , a 25-@xmath0m - only object .",
    "nothing definitive can be gleaned from the _ iras _ photometry or its low resolution spectrum .",
    "no counterparts appear in either the 2mass images or those of the southern h@xmath20 survey ( parker et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting high extinction toward the putative mir and radio source .",
    "glimpse at 8.0@xmath0 m offers a survey three orders of magnitude deeper than msx at 8.3@xmath0 m .",
    "this enables us to probe the mir / radio ratios for sources other than hii regions .",
    "all five of the suspected background galaxies in the _ l_=312@xmath1 field , described by cg , were detected by the sst at 8.0@xmath0 m .",
    "all appear as point sources and so require no aperture correction",
    ". the ratios of _",
    "irac_/most for g310.86 + 0.01 , g311.54@xmath100.02 , g312.11@xmath100.20 , g313.25 + 0.32 , and g313.42 + 0.09 are 0.080 , 0.009 , 0.081 , 0.019 , and 0.034 , respectively .",
    "the average ratio for these galaxies is 0.04@xmath20.01 , 900 times smaller than the empirical ratio for thermal emission .",
    "if we interpret the extended 8-@xmath0 m structure that is associated with radio thermal emission as due to pahs then it is interesting that even diffuse radio regions in this field have 8-@xmath0 m emission .",
    "this implies that these patchy zones are not optically thin to ionizing radiation because they apparently have pdrs . seemingly the only environment in this field that shows a deficit of pahs ( as traced by 8-@xmath0 m imagery ) is toward snrs .",
    "very few snrs were detected by msx ( cohen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) present an msx image of cas - a ) and nonthermal emission regions are very faint below 9@xmath0 m , compared with thermal zones .",
    "when one might suspect that a nonthermal region was detected it is invariably the case that msx observed a mixture of thermal and nonthermal filaments but only thermal structures were detected .",
    "two ( g310.65@xmath100.29 , g310.80@xmath100.41 ) of the four snrs in this field are so confused by diffuse and filamentary thermal emission that no useful measurements or even upper limits can be made of their purely nonthermal portions .",
    "the snr g312.44@xmath100.36 is very large ( 40arcmin ) and its interior includes a considerable amount of diffuse emission , probably thermal , and a considerable number of point and compact sources .",
    "these circumstances render it a poor candidate for determining the ratio of nonthermal mir / radio emission .",
    "however , the radio - bright young remnant g311.52@xmath100.34 , discovered by green ( 1974 ) , is detected by glimpse .",
    "[ snr2 ] overlays the 4.5-@xmath0 m residual _ irac _ image by 13-cm continuum contours ( atca data kindly provided by josi gelfand ) .",
    "the spatially integrated , sky - subtracted 8.0-@xmath0 m flux density of this snr can be compared with the integrated radio continuum .",
    "the empirical 8.0-@xmath0 m to 843-mhz ratio is 0.19 , or 0.14 after aperture correction .",
    "wcl list one other nonthermal object , g313.45@xmath100.13 , but this too lies amidst bright thermal filaments .",
    "combining the ratios for the five galaxies with the aperture - corrected ratio for snr g311.52@xmath100.34 yields an average irac / most ratio of 0.06@xmath20.02 , over 600 times smaller than the thermal ratio . on this basis ,",
    "the mir / radio ratio is a sharp discriminant between thermal and nonthermal emission .",
    "the electronic version of our paper carries a 3-band false colour image ( fig .",
    "[ snr3 ] ) in which 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8-@xmath0 m emission are coded blue , green and red , respectively and the remnant can be traced around its complete shell .",
    "we have sampled the four brightest areas of mir emission ( roughly one in each quandrant around the elliptical ring ) to derive four estimates of _ irac _ colours for the snr .",
    "the mean values that we calculate yield observed ratios of integrated flux densities at 3.6 and 5.8@xmath0 m of 0.17@xmath20.06 , and at 4.5 and 8.0@xmath0 m of 0.43@xmath20.06 . after applying the ssc aperture corrections",
    "these become 0.21@xmath20.07 and 0.55@xmath20.08 , respectively .",
    "reach et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that shocked gas contributes the _ irac _ emission from this snr .",
    "our colours , within their uncertainties , overlap the predicted colour - colour box presented by reach et al .",
    "( 2006 : their fig .",
    "2 ) for ionized gas that has suffered a fast shock .",
    "the mir emission is most obvious at 4.5@xmath0 m , and somewhat less bright at 5.8@xmath0 m , due dominantly to br-@xmath20 and [ feii ] lines , respectively , according to fig .  1 of reach et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "we present evidence that the absolute diffuse calibration of sst at 8.0@xmath0 m is too high by about 36percent .",
    "all measured _ irac _ surface brightnesses of any diffuse emission region should be scaled down by a multiplicative factor of 0.74@xmath20.07 , based on the absolutely calibrated msx images .",
    "this provides a totally independent confirmation of the separate analyses of _ irac _",
    "s diffuse calibration that are based upon the fundamental calibration of the instrument ( 0.737 : reach et al .",
    "2005 ) and detailed modeling of the light distributions of elliptical galaxies ( 0.74@xmath20.07 : jarrett 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , the recommendation of the ssc that one should scale down 8.0-@xmath0 m diffuse bcd flux densities by a multiplicative factor of 0.74 should indeed produce the best absolute estimate of any extended 8.0-@xmath0 m emission .",
    "we find that mir and radio fluxes are linearly related from our regression analysis .",
    "these correlations reflect the intimate association between ionized zones and their surrounding pdrs in which polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon band emission arises . our median analysis for hii regions of f@xmath22/s@xmath23 yields 25@xmath25 ( standard error of the median ) , confirming cg s original derivation .",
    "this ratio of mir / radio integrated fluxes is independent of morphology of the ionized region but is valid only for radio structures smaller than @xmath724arcmin .",
    "aperture synthesis by most implies that the telescope is progressively less sensitive to structure on scale sizes @xmath2415arcmin , diminishing the estimated fluxes of larger sources .",
    "compact hii regions below @xmath73 arcmin in size tend to have somewhat smaller mir / radio ratios , which might be attributed to absorption by dust grains of uv photons in some of these small , dense regions .",
    "the only cometary region in our sample appears to suffer substantial thermal self - absorption of its radio flux .",
    "we find an equivalent correlation for hii regions between observed 8.0@xmath0 m and 843-mhz fluxes , albeit with more scatter than for msx . with the sst pipeline and calibration that were applied to the glimpse images released to the community , we find an observed value of f@xmath25/s@xmath23  =  36@xmath213 best represents this relationship . removing the 36percent absolute calibration problem this corresponds to an aperture - corrected ratio for _ irac_8.0/most of 27@xmath210 , very similar to the msx / most criterion for radio thermal emission regions .",
    "supernova remnants studied with glimpse images ( reach et al .",
    "2006 ) show that none has appreciable mir synchrotron radiation and the dominant post - shock cooling is usually through h@xmath18 lines .",
    "this leads to much smaller mir intensities compared with the radio continuum than for thermal sources , which are intimately associated with pdrs and their bright and broadband pah emission features .",
    "the mir / radio flux ratio discriminates between thermal and nonthermal regions . for the latter , the ratio is 0.06@xmath20.02 , some 600 times smaller than for hii regions .",
    "the mir morphology of hii regions does not match their radio structure one - to - one .",
    "this is most readily seen by examination of table  1 where the new homogeneous radio and mir morphologies appear side by side .",
    "a diversity of mir characteristics can be associated with individual radio types .",
    "there is clear evidence for extended mir emission surrounding even compact and cometary hii regions .",
    "either filaments or diffuse emission may be found around the cores of compact regions , though some appear truly isolated on the sub - arcminute scale . when diffuse mir structure is found outside the cores of compact hii regions it has the colour of pah emission .",
    "consequently , compact hii regions may indeed have mir counterparts to the postulated weakly ionized radio haloes . a valid question after examination of these glimpse images",
    "is whether there are any compact hii regions in the mir without shells , filaments , and haloes . given the high - resolution of the sst with _",
    "one might wish to develop new quantitative criteria for hii regions , in addition to our mir morphological characterization .",
    "the seds of all the hii regions in our sample show little variation in the wavelength range seen by the four _ irac _ bands .",
    "well - defined colours have been determined from this sample , and diagnostic boxes proposed for two _ irac _ colour - colour planes .",
    "there is good separation in these plots between the colours of diffuse thermal emission and those of the plethora of mir point sources encountered in the galactic plane .",
    "the colours of known pointlike or ultracompact hii regions are also sharply distinguished from those of diffuse thermal regions in these plots .",
    "the advantages of combining mir and radio aspects of particular sources are illustrated by the unique mir structure of g311.70 + 0.31 in this field .",
    "_ irac _ s two longest bands offer a highly sensitive tool for testing for pah emission by comparing morphologies at different wavelengths that are each dominated by these molecular bands .",
    "false colour imagery of g311.70 + 0.31 shows the excellent match between the mir configurations of the source at 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 m , strongly suggestive of the dominance of pah spectral features in these two images .",
    "the flux ratio , msx / most , is exactly what one expects for the combination of thermal radio continuum and 8.3-@xmath0 m emission from pah features .",
    "cg emphasized the value of msx s filters in which pah structure detected at 8.3@xmath0 m would be mimicked in the 12.1-@xmath0 m image .",
    "msx had a large disparity in responsivity between the 8.3-@xmath0 m band and all others , whereas _",
