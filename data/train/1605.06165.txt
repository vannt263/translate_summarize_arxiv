    "the major obstacles in the proof of theorem [ thm : h : vtilde ] are the following :    a.   on the hyperplane @xmath108 , the matrix @xmath109 becomes degenerate ( if @xmath110 ) or singular ( if @xmath111 ) .",

    "* theorem 2 ) , which is essential for the weak - harnack inequality in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) ) can not be applied to .",
    "c.   also , since @xmath113 becomes degenerate or singular , the solvability of the dirichlet problem for @xmath114 in can not be taken for granted and then the argument from @xcite used to prove the critical - density estimate ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ) can not be carried out for .",

    "we show that , despite the degeneracy or singularity of @xmath113 and under the hypothesis @xmath50 only , a critical - density estimate for @xmath94 ( theorem [ thm : cd ] below ) can be established , for _ some _ @xmath117 , in terms of the @xmath118-norm of the normal derivative @xmath119 .",
    "that is , a suitable control on the normal derivative will allow for a critical - density estimate in the absence of the hypothesis of continuous second - order derivates and positive - definite hessian .",

    ", mean - value inequalities ( see theorems [ thm : lb : q=1 ] and [ thm : lb ] ) can be obtained by fairly standard arguments , as described in section [ sec : lb ] .",

    "as mentioned , the methods from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections  2  and  3 ) are not applicable .",
    "instead , we rely on the variational side of the linearized monge  ampre equation .",

    "however , in section [ sec : ls = lls ] we prove that , modulo a change of variables ( more precisely , a change in the extension variables @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) , the equality @xmath126 does hold true .",
    "a key consequence of this equality is the energy estimate for @xmath81 given by in remark [ rmk : finite : e ] . although @xmath81 solves the pde in which can also be written in divergence form , we were able to arrive at the energy estimate only by going through @xmath127 .    with this insight on the variational side of @xmath81 , in section [ sec : pi : f ]",
    "we develop a weak poincar inequality associated to @xmath128 .",
    "one advantage of working in the variational context ( which is based on energy estimates ) is that the pointwise singularity of @xmath129 will become inconsequential because @xmath130 for every @xmath49 . in turn , in section [ sec : every : cd ] we use the poincar inequality to prove a critical - density estimate for _ every _ @xmath131 ( see theorem [ thm : every : cd ] ) . in section [ sec : weak : h ] we use the fact that the critical density can be taken small enough and combine it with a covering lemma to prove a weak - harnack inequality for @xmath94 ( see theorem [ thm : weak : h ] ) . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : proofs : main ] we bring all the previous results together to prove theorems [ h : nondiver ] and [ thm : h : vtilde ] .",
