    "studies of the nuclear structure for nuclei lying away from the @xmath16-stable valley of the nuclear chart has been a challenging situation of late , due to new phenomena being observed such as the shell - quenching@xcite of the so - called magic shell gaps , and the onset of exotic deformations leading to the existence of the so - called `` island of inversion''@xcite . improved experimental technology and increased accuracy of the necessary tools have provided the desired boost making feasible for such discoveries .",
    "more or less , such issues are associated with the onset of increased collectivity@xcite leading to possible occurrence of large deformations of those nuclei lying in the exotic regions of the nuclear chart . in this connection values of the physical quantities such as",
    "the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability @xmath0 for the transition from the ground state to the first @xmath1 state and the corresponding excitation energy @xmath2 of even - even nuclei play very decisive role@xcite in identifying such occurrences of increased collectivity .",
    "particularly the resulting quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath3 and the ratio of @xmath3 to the weisskopf single - particle @xmath4 derived from them significantly help in this regard . over the years host of such experimental data for these two physical quantities have led raman et al .",
    "@xcite to undertake the well - known oak - ridge nuclear data project @xcite to make a comprehensive analysis of all such data leading to compilation of the desired adopted data table in the year 1987@xcite and 2001 @xcite .",
    "more recently pritychenko et al .",
    "@xcite have continued the same oak - ridge program in compiling the newly emerging data for even - even nuclei near @xmath17 28 .",
    "thus the study of these two physical quantities @xmath0 and @xmath2 has been under constant investigation both by experimentalists and theorists .",
    "several theoretical study of these quantities have been the epitome of various models and authors [ see for instance raman et al.s @xcite comprehensive analysis ] .",
    "global systematics particularly by grodzins@xcite , bohr and mottelson @xcite and wang et al .",
    "@xcite were quite useful in the past .",
    "however for local systematics of these quantities , models in terms of difference equations developed by ross and bhaduri @xcite and by patnaik et al .",
    "@xcite were found to be successful to some extent . in this",
    "regard our recently developed differential equation model@xcite for the physical quantity @xmath18 has been found to be quite successful .",
    "in fact we could later on succeed in extending @xcite the same model to include its complementary physical quantity , namely the excitation energy @xmath2 . according to this model which we may term it as the generalized differential equation ( gde ) model",
    ", the value of both these quantities for a given even - even nucleus is expressed in terms of their derivatives with respect to the corresponding neutron and proton numbers n , z. the same differential equation in the model has been further exploited to generate two recursion relations , which are mainly responsible for the success@xcite of the model not only for fitting the known data , but also for predicting the unknown when compared with the recently compiled experimental data of pritychenko et al .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath17 28 region . in passing",
    ", we may note that we@xcite could visualize such a differential equation for these quantities on the basis of their close similarity in reflecting the shell - structure with the so - called local energy of the infinite nuclear matter ( inm ) model@xcite of atomic nuclei developed over the years primarily based on the generalized@xcite hugenholtz - van hove theorem@xcite of many - body theory .",
    "it may be of interest to note that the form of the differential equation in the gde model as well as for the local energy in the inm model are exactly similar to that of the generalized@xcite hvh theorem of many - body theory .",
    "we may further stress here that any relation in the form of a differential equation for any physical quantity is intrinsically sound enough to possess the desirable feature of good predictive ability .",
    "in fact this was found to be true behind the success@xcite of the inm model as a mass formula and also with the presently considered gde model@xcite",
    ".    here in the present work , we are particularly interested to focus possible occurrence of increased collectivity leading to identification of exotic deformations for the nuclides lying mostly in the neutron- and proton - rich ( n - rich and p - rich ) regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "this is achieved from our analysis of the widely predicted data made in our model for the two physical quantities @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and from the deformation parameters calculated from them .",
    "accordingly we used our model first , in predicting their values for most of the even - even isotopes lying in the nuclear chart from z=8 to 100 ( o to fm ) confined to the known data - set region of raman et al .",
    "@xcite , and then to the adjacent isotopes for which such values are not yet experimentally available .",
    "then in the second step , we utilized these predicted values in calculating the relevant deformation parameters , namely the quadrupole deformation @xmath3 , the ratio of @xmath3 to the weisskopf single - particle @xmath4 , and the intrinsic electric quadrupole moment @xmath5 following the usual model - dependent formalism , in which nuclei are treated as having uniform charge distributions .",
    "these calculations provide us the necessary tools to analyze our data in a better way in identifying possible occurrence of increased collectivity and the resulting exotic deformations .    in the following section 2 ,",
    "we first of all discuss our model in brief for sake of continuity and fruitful analysis of the resulting data .",
    "section 3 deals with the usual details of calculation .",
    "subsequently we present our results and discuss them in section 4 .",
    "finally we highlight our main findings in the concluding section 5 .",
    "general features along with the details of the model has been well described elsewhere first@xcite for @xmath0 and secondly@xcite for @xmath2 . since our main interest here is to analyze the model predictions for identifying exotic deformations , we simply highlight its basic equations and features .",
    "the principal equation of the model valid for both @xmath0 and the corresponding excitation energy @xmath2 is given by @xmath19,\\ ] ] where n , z and a refer to the neutron , proton and mass numbers of the given nucleus .",
    "@xmath16 is the usual asymmetry parameter ( n - z)/a of the nucleus . the variable @xmath20 represents both the physical quantities @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "as we can see , the relation ( [ c ] ) connects both @xmath0 and @xmath2 of a given nucleus to their partial derivatives with respect to the neutron and proton numbers n and z. we may state here for sake of a comprehensive understanding , that the very basis behind its proposition goes to a similar equation being satisfied by the local energy component of the ground - state energy of a nucleus , specifically simulating its shell and deformation behavior in the infinite nuclear matter ( inm ) model @xcite of atomic nuclei primarily built on the basis of the generalized@xcite hvh theorem@xcite of many - body theory . even though its proposition for these two physical quantities @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath2 has been made on close similarity with the local energy term of the inm model , it can be treated as a semi - empirical equation as it has been found@xcite to be satisfied by them by virtue of their slow variation with neutron and proton numbers n and z locally .",
    "hence the differential eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) for these two physical quantities may be better termed as localized semi - empirical equation like the difference equations of ross and bhaduri@xcite and pattnayak et al.@xcite .",
    "we further like to highlight the interesting fact that the form of the differential equation ( [ c ] ) for these two physical quantities , for the local energy @xmath21 of the inm model and the generalized hvh theorem concerning energy per nucleon of the asymmetric nuclear matter are all exactly similar in nature .",
    "of course the genesis of the local energy relation in the inm model owes its origin to the generalized hvh theorem , whereas formulation of the differential equation for the two physical quantities @xmath0 and @xmath2 simulating the local energy @xmath21 obviously got the same form . at the same time",
    "however we should note that while the hvh theorem is an exact theorem of the many - body theory , the differential equation ( [ c ] ) for all the physical quantities concerning the finite nucleus can be termed as model - dependent .    then using the usual forward and backward definitions pair - wise for both the derivatives given by @xmath22-c    [ n , z]\\bigr ] , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "one may further note that the choice of either forward or backward definitions for both the two derivatives occurring in the eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) facilitate derivation of the close - knit first order recursion relations ( [ b2f ] and [ b2b ] ) , each connecting three immediate neighboring even - even nuclei with neutron , proton and mass numbers differing at best by two units in the nucleon space as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , a fact which is of our primary concern .",
    "in contrast , mixed definitions , i.e , one forward and the backward for the derivatives would lead to second order relations connecting nuclei having mass numbers differing up to four units as can be seen in fig . 1(b ) and hence are ignored .",
    "it is essential to stress here that these recursion relations not only connect isotopes of the same element but also different neighboring elements having proton numbers z , z-2 and z+2 .",
    "therefore these recursion relations should not be interpreted as interpolation and extrapolation formulas .",
    "moreover one should also note that since these relations connect isotopes of the neighboring elements , they facilitate prediction of the hitherto unknown data for the desired isotopes of a given element using the existing data of the relevant isotopes of the neighboring elements , even if its own data for the neighboring isotopes are either not available or scantly available .",
    "even these interconnections connecting the isotopes of the neighboring elements provide possible means of bridging sharply changing isotopic variations of these two physical quantities across the isotopes of a given element .    in actual practice , we use the known available data in the neighborhood of a given nucleus in the two recursion relations ( [ b2f ] ) and ( [ b2b ] ) separately to generate its all possible values for @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "since each of these relations can be rearranged in three different ways by shifting the three terms occurring in them from left to right and vice - verse , in principle one can generate up to six alternate values at best for a given nucleus .",
    "this is however subject to availability of the corresponding data .",
    "again each of them being equally probable , the predicted value is then obtained by the arithmetic mean of all those generated values so obtained .",
    "we would like to comment here that this method of taking the arithmetic mean of the equally - probable generated values for a given isotope in a way , achieves some sort of uniqueness in the model predictions and at the same time automatically takes care of all possible local connections in a given locality . that is why this scheme has been found to be successful@xcite in our limited predictions made earlier for both the physical quantities @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , our actual calculation procedure uses the available experimental data in predicting values of these two physical quantities both for the known as well as for the hitherto unknown even - even nuclides .",
    "the predictions made in the first generation thus obtained for the unknown , are again used along with the known data in the second step to generate the next generation predictions and so on .",
    "this procedure is continued to reach out more and more neighboring regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "however we must mention here , that although this scheme in principle can be continued as widely as we please in the nuclear chart , in practice , it is terminated to avoid accumulation of errors .",
    "nevertheless , we find that three to four generations are sufficient enough to reach out a large number of isotopes on either side of the normal @xmath16-stable valley for our present study .",
    "following the procedure laid down in the previous section , we have carried out the prediction scheme in the model using the combined data set of both raman et al .",
    "@xcite and pritychenko et al .",
    "@xcite near @xmath24 as the input experimental data .",
    "accordingly the total number of @xmath0 input data comprises altogether 330 even - even nuclides spread over the entire nuclear landscape ranging from o to fm ( z=8 to 100 ) , while the same for @xmath2 is 557 . since our main interest in the present study is to identify possible occurrence of exotic regions of deformation in the n- and p - rich regions adjacent to the already known data valley , we have confined our calculations up to three to four generations of our prediction scheme . as a result ,",
    "our present calculations have yielded hitherto unknown @xmath0 data of 278 adjacent isotopes and @xmath2 values of 175 isotopes apart from for those of the known data set .    in the next step",
    ", we used these predicted data for calculating the standard deformation parameters such as the quadrupole deformation @xmath3 and the ratio of @xmath3 to the weisskopf single - particle @xmath4 , termed here as @xmath25 for simplicity .",
    "we would like to stress here that the value of the quadrupole deformation @xmath3 more or less reflects the nature of collectivity of a given nucleus .",
    "its zero value would mean no deformation at all while its finite value would otherwise indicate increasing deformations or collectivity of a given nucleus .",
    "in general , its value up to 0.1 more or less reflects spherical nuclei while that of in the range 0.1 - 0.2 usually correspond to normal deformations . on the contrary",
    "its value in the range 0.3 - 0.5 has been shown@xcite to reflect strong deformations in nuclei while its value of @xmath260.55 - 0.65 has been considered@xcite to indicate super deformation .",
    "therefore any such value beyond 0.3 for a given nucleus may be considered as to reflect large deformation .",
    "apart from @xmath3 , we would also consider a supplementary quantity namely @xmath25 as referred above .",
    "we may point out here that the ratio @xmath25 has been considered@xcite more significant in reflecting possible occurrence of the collective effects in nuclei .",
    "the expressions for these quantities can be obtained in a model - dependent formalism , in which nuclei are treated as to have uniform charge distributions out to distance @xmath27 and zero charge beyond .",
    "the defining equation for the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath3 is as usual given by @xmath28 , \\label{rth}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 corresponds to the radius of a constant density undistorted nucleus and @xmath30 is the usual axially - symmetric spherical harmonics .",
    "then the well - known relation that has been widely used in the literature@xcite for computing the deformation parameter @xmath3 from the model - independent physical quantity @xmath0 simply follows as [ see for instance",
    "roy & nigam@xcite ] @xmath31)[b(e2)\\uparrow / e^2]^{1/2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the usual nuclear radius parameter , the value of which is usually taken for compilation of such data as 1.2 fm and @xmath0 is in units of @xmath33 .",
    "we would like to make a note here that the above expression for @xmath3 [ notations may vary ] has been widely used invariably by most of the groups see for instance raman et al @xcite for extracting its value from the experimental @xmath0 data .    for calculating the weisskopf single - particle @xmath4 value ,",
    "its expression can be derived by substituting the corresponding weisskopf single - particle @xmath0 value given by    @xmath34    in eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "then the expression for @xmath4 simply follows as @xmath35)\\times \\sqrt{0.297},\\ ] ] which numerically can be simplified as 1.59/z as has been done by raman et al.@xcite .",
    "thus one can calculate the ratio @xmath25 using eqs .",
    "( [ b2 ] and [ bs ] ) .",
    "apart from these two quantities , we also calculate another useful physical quantity , namely , the intrinsic electric quadrupole moment @xmath5 in units of @xmath36 given by    @xmath37^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    thus we see that using these eqs .",
    "( [ b2 ] , [ bs ] and [ q ] ) , all the relevant deformation parameters can be calculated from @xmath0 .    before ending this section",
    "it is worth mentioning the fact that @xmath4 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) remains a fractional constant for all the isotopes of a given element , and hence simply acts as a constant dividing factor for the quantity @xmath25 for all those isotopes .",
    "thus the numerical values of the deformation parameter @xmath25 effectively gets enhanced for all those isotopes having large deformations by virtue of their larger @xmath3 values compared to those lying in the normal @xmath16-stable valley for a given element . as a result there can not exist a definite value for this quantity to decide whether a particular isotope has a larger or a smaller deformation .",
    "therefore the nature of deformation for a given isotope can only be ascertained by comparing its @xmath25 value with those of its already known neighboring isotopes .",
    "as per the details laid down above , we have first carried out the predictions of @xmath2 and @xmath0 data for the desired isotopes lying both in the known and the hitherto unknown regions of the nuclear chart . then using these predicted data we subsequently calculated the deformation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath25 by using the formulas ( [ b2],[bs ] ) .",
    "our calculations have yielded @xmath0 values of altogether 608 nuclides which include the input data of 330 . similarly our @xmath2 predictions have yielded 732 nuclides that include input data of 557 . since our main interest being the identification of the possible exotic deformations in the hitherto unknown data regions , we present here in table 1 only such data that are confined to those regions .",
    "we also present in the same table the calculated values of the deformation parameters @xmath3 , @xmath25 and @xmath5 .    in general",
    ", one can easily identify possible occurrence of the increasing collectivity and the consequent exotic deformations specially from the relatively larger values of @xmath3 and @xmath25 from table 1 . as stated earlier any value of @xmath3 larger than 0.3",
    "more or less reflects higher deformation and increasing collectivity of the given nucleus .",
    "such observations can be further supplemented by the increasing values of @xmath25 . however , for sake of conveying better visual display of such occurrences as scrutinized from the tabulated values , we graphically present values of these two deformation parameters for the isotope series as isolines only for those elements in the figs . 2 - 7 .",
    "accordingly the graphs displayed in these figures correspond to such elements having proton number z=10 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 36 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 60 , 62 , 64 , 66 and z=92 .",
    "we would like to again stress here that our choice of these elements purely follows from our primary interest of identifying any possibility of exotic deformation in the exotic n- and p - rich regions of the nuclear chart . consequently our close scrutiny of table 1 shows increasing trends in the values of the deformation parameters for either in the n - rich or p - rich or both for the isotopes of the stated elements except however for z=66 .",
    "for instance the @xmath3 value increases from 0.075 to 0.513 with increasing neutron number from n=32 to 38 , while @xmath25 values increase from 1.043 to 7.116 for the element z=22 .",
    "we have intentionally chosen to include the isoline for z=66 just to highlight how such cases need not be considered due to the uninteresting nature of variation of the deformation parameters in the exotic n- and p - rich regions .",
    "for sake of comparative analysis and continuity in the graphical presentations , we have also included in these graphs our predictions in the known - data regions along with the adopted experimental values@xcite to help us to compare the relative values of both @xmath3 and @xmath25 in our endeavor for identification of possible exotic deformations .",
    "inclusion of the adopted experimental values in these graphs on the other hand would testify the goodness of the model predictions .",
    "in fact one can easily identify hitherto unknown - data isotopes from these graphs having large values of @xmath3 ( @xmath38)and relatively larger values of @xmath25 both in the n- and p - rich regions .",
    "such relatively large values of these parameters obviously signify possible occurrence of exotic deformations for those isotopes .    now coming to analyzing the individual cases , we find [ see figs .",
    "2 ( a ) and table 1 ] the values of the deformation parameter @xmath3 as 0.59 and 0.63 respectively at n=20 and 22 for ne ( z=10 ) . despite n=20 being",
    "a magic number and n=22 is close to it , both these two n - rich isotopes are found to have such large values of @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath25 values of these isotopes are respectively 3.73 and 3.99 , which are definitely larger than those of its own known neighbors as can be seen from fig . 5 ( a ) .",
    "thus such increase is a clear indication of the possible occurrence of higher deformations in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "fortunately this finding of ours is well - supported by the recent experimental observation of enhanced collectivity for @xmath41 and the resulting disappearance of n=20 shell - closure by yanagisawa et al.@xcite .",
    "the authors of this experiment have attributed such occurrence of strong collectivity by breaking of the n=20 shell - closure by the intruder states from the pf - shell and hence are in favor of its inclusion in the `` island of inversion '' @xcite .",
    "even the neighboring nuclide @xmath42 has been also found to be highly deformed as its @xmath3 value is 0.50 [ see table 1 ] in agreement with the experimental finding by iwasaki et al .",
    "incidentally this nuclide has also the same neutron number n=22 as that of @xmath43 .    our close scrutiny",
    "[ see fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ] also lead us to find possible occurrence of large collectivity for @xmath7 as its @xmath3 value is 0.51 , which is almost close to that of super deformation . its @xmath25 value has been found to be 7.11 which is again much larger compared to its neighboring known isotopes [ see fig . 7 ( a ) ] . accordingly",
    "this n - rich isotope of @xmath44 is most likely be heavily deformed despite its neutron number 38 is very close to the semi - magic number 40 and its proton number is also very close to the magic number 20 , thereby clearly supporting the possible manifestation for the occurrence of another `` island of inversion '' caused by the intruder states from gd - shell@xcite .",
    "similarly such occurrences are also seen in case of @xmath45 and @xmath46 [ see figs .",
    "2(b - d ) , 5(b - d ) for @xmath3 and @xmath25 respectively ] .",
    "the @xmath3 values for all these nuclei lie in the range 0.29 - 0.41 signifying large collectivity .",
    "we also see that the @xmath25 values for all these nuclei lying in the range 4.96 - 6.13 are well above the corresponding values of their neighboring known isotopes .",
    "incidentally these predictions of ours are again well - supported by the recent experimental observation of increased quadrupole collectivity in @xmath47 and @xmath48 in a coulomb - excitation experiment by crawford et al .",
    "it is further interesting to find more support from another experimental observation of strong deformation by sorlin et al @xcite for the isotopes @xmath49 . in all these n - rich isotopes",
    "including @xmath7 as stated above , the n=40 sub - shell closure most possibly gets broken due to the intruder orbitals @xmath50 and @xmath51 leading to strong collectivity in agreement with the conclusions arrived at by sorlin et al .",
    "@xcite .    concerning isotopes of kr , sr and zr ( z=36 , 38 and 40 ) , we find the exotic isotopes @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 to have values of @xmath3 lying in the range 0.40 - 0.49 [ see figs .",
    "2(e - f ) , 4(b ) ] , while those of @xmath25 lie in the range 10.3 - 11.6 [ see figs .",
    "5(e - f ) , 7(b ) ] .",
    "obviously such values of @xmath3 for these isotopes are quite large enough to signify high deformations in them .",
    "it is quite satisfying to note here that our present finding of large deformation with a @xmath3 value of 0.4 for @xmath55 in fact has been well - corroborated by lister et al.@xcite long back experimentally .",
    "one can also see that the n - rich isotope @xmath56 [ see figs .",
    "4(b ) and 7(b ) ] can also be treated as highly deformed as its @xmath3 and @xmath25 values are almost close to the above ranges . for the neighboring element",
    "mo , we also find relatively larger values of @xmath3 lying in the range 0.39 - 0.46 [ see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] for the isotopes @xmath11 . whereas their @xmath25 values lying in the range 10.3 - 12.2 are quite large enough compared to their known neighbors qualifying them to have large deformations",
    "[ see fig .",
    "6(a ) ] . prediction of such strong collectvity for the exotic isotopes @xmath57 and @xmath58 may be again connected to the possible existence of another `` island of inversion '' by breaking of the n=70 sub - shell closure by the intruder states from hfp- shell .",
    "thus the existence of two `` islands of inversion '' already detected experimentally with the breaking of shell - closures at n=20 and n=40 , and our present prediction of another one at n=70 sub - shell closure appears to be a general feature of nuclear dynamics in the exotic n - rich regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "similarly for the isotopes of te , xe and ba ( z=52 , 54 and 56 ) , we see relatively higher than normal deformations for the nuclides @xmath12 and @xmath59 as their @xmath3 values range from 0.25 to 0.33 [ see fig .",
    "3(b - d ) ] . the same feature is well reflected with the wide - ranging values of @xmath25 from 7.5 to 11.7 [ see fig .",
    "6(b - d ) ] .",
    "we would like to further add here that our calculation also shows the p - rich isotope @xmath60 to be well - deformed [ see fig .",
    "3(d ) and 6(d ) ] in agreement with the experimental findings by morikawa et al.@xcite .",
    "concerning the isotopes of ce , nd , sm and gd ( z=58 , 60 , 62 and 64 ) , we find the values of @xmath3 to lie in the range 0.36 - 0.46 [ see figs .",
    "3(e - f ) , 4(c - d ) ] , thereby indicating possible occurrence of exotic deformations for the isotopes @xmath61 and @xmath15 .",
    "these findings are once again well supported by the values of @xmath25 lying in the range 14.2 - 17.5 [ see figs .",
    "6(e - f ) , 7(c - d ) ] . as usual",
    "these values are larger than the corresponding values of their respective known neighboring isotopes .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we have also shown @xmath3 and @xmath25 isolines for z=66 in the figs .",
    "4 ( e ) and 7 ( e ) just to highlight the border cases that we have ignored .",
    "we see that both the deformation parameters almost remain unchanged with increase of neutrons and even show decreasing trends .",
    "this is perhaps a clear indication of no substantive change in nuclear structure .",
    "hence such variation in the deformation parameters for the isolines of other elements that we have not included in our present study may not be of much interest .    finally coming to the case of uranium ( z=92 ) in the very heavy - mass region as shown in the figs .",
    "4 ( f ) and 7 ( f ) , we find slight increasing trends in the values of the deformation parameters with the increasing neutron number from n=146 to 154 .",
    "we see that @xmath3 value increases monotonically from 0.29 to 0.30 and those of @xmath25 from 16.73 to 18.62 .",
    "therefore we are of the view that the tendency for higher deformation possibly exists , but without having any dramatic change in the nuclear structure .",
    "thus , in general the regions in the nuclear chart corresponding to the said isotopes discussed above as well as some in the immediate neighborhood could be possible regions of large scale exotic deformations , as the values of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath62 are closer to and even greater than 0.3 .",
    "as usual the values of @xmath25 are are relatively larger than their respective known neighboring isotopes .",
    "expectedly such behavior is well supported by the values of the other physical quantity namely the intrinsic electric quadrupole moment @xmath5 , which we have plotted for all the isotope series against the neutron number n in figs .",
    "the increasing value of @xmath5 for those isotopes as seen from these figures clearly corroborate our findings .    even more importantly , all these findings of exotic deformation listed above have been well borne out with our predicted values of the other physical quantity , namely , the excitation energy @xmath2 as can be seen from table 1 .",
    "graphical presentations as shown in figs .",
    "11 - 13 also bear out the same features more convincingly",
    ". we should remember that unlike the deformation parameters derived from the values of @xmath0 , values of @xmath2 are determined completely independent of the former .",
    "hence the nature of the isotopic behavior of @xmath2 is expected not only independent but at the same time opposite to that of the @xmath0 .",
    "this is exactly the case as it should be with @xmath2 , as we see from the complementary nature of the graphs displayed in the figs .",
    "11 - 13 in contrast to those of the deformation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "we find that the @xmath2 values of the concerned isotopes claimed to have large deformations are almost increasingly small as they lie on the peripheral portions of the graphs , in contrast to the opposite behavior in case of @xmath0 and the deformation parameters derived from it such as @xmath3 , @xmath25 and @xmath5 .",
    "numerically our predicted e2 values for almost all the isotopes of ne , ti , cr , fe , ni and kr in the low- and medium - mass regions claimed to have large deformations lie in the range 0.35 - 1.4 mev .",
    "even experimental e2 values of some of these isotopes also lie in the range 0.7- 1.1 mev [ see for instance fig .",
    "11 for the isotopes @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . whereas both predicted and experimental e2 values of the claimed isotopes having high deformations in the heavy - mass region almost lie in the range 0.07 - 0.5 mev .",
    "thus our predicted e2 values convincingly support possible existence of exotic high deformations perceived from the predicted @xmath66 values and the deformation parameters calculated from it .    before ending this section , we just want to highlight here regarding the nature of agreement of our model predictions with the adopted @xmath67 and e2 data , which of course has been well - demonstrated while developing@xcite the model . here",
    "the goodness of agreement is once again borne out from the close agreement of the derived quantities @xmath68 and @xmath5 , and @xmath2 itself as seen from the figs . 2 - 13 .",
    "it is rather remarkable to see the nature of good agreement of the sharply changing isotopic variations of our model predictions with those of experiment in almost all the cases as seen from the figs . 2 - 13 , vindicating our assertion made earlier about the recursion relations ( [ b2f ] and [ b2b ] ) that they should not be treated as interpolation or extrapolation formulas .",
    "the data of the isotopes of the neighboring elements play decisive role in this regard as the recursion relations connect nuclei having proton numbers z , z-2 and z+2 .",
    "thus such remarkable agreement with the experimental data @xcite throughout and particularly the nature of sharply changing isotopic variations in most cases bear clear testimony of the goodness of the gde model .      having identified possible regions of exotic deformation with our predicted data , it would be of interest to compare our predicted values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 against any new experimental data if available , which we have not included in our prediction scheme .",
    "this would be highly desirable as they would provide the test of reliability of our predictions and establish our model for good . in this connection , we happened to come across a recent arxive article by pritychenko et al .",
    "@xcite of their latest data compilation for some of the neighboring nuclides adjacent to the already known data set .",
    "obviously this new adopted data set at least would give us a good opportunity to test our model predictions for some if not for all . from our close scrutiny of our predicted data given in table 1 and",
    "those of the latest experimental data @xcite , we find that hitherto unknown data of 77 nuclides in case of @xmath0 and 65 nuclides in case of of @xmath2 are available for this comparative analysis . with this view we followed raman et al s @xcite prescription of comparing in terms of the order of agreement of our predicted data with these new experimental data .",
    "accordingly we have presented the ratio of the predicted values with those of the newly adopted data for @xmath2 and @xmath0 respectively in figs .",
    "14 and 15 .",
    "one can easily see that 60 out of 65 data points for @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "14 ) lie within the box indicating the percentage of agreement as 92% .",
    "such an agreement can be termed excellent as per the yardstick stipulated by raman et al @xcite .    similarly in case of @xmath0 predictions",
    ", we see that 62 data points out of 77 lie within the box ( see fig .",
    "15 ) with the resulting percentage of agreement as 81% . compared to @xmath2 the degree of agreement for @xmath0 is somewhat less .",
    "however on close scrutiny we find , that most of the 14 cases that lie outside the box ( see fig .",
    "15 ) have relatively larger experimental uncertainty@xcite to the tune of 40 to 109% .",
    "just to cite few examples , the adopted @xmath0 value of @xmath69 is 0.2279 @xmath70 , while the same for @xmath71 is 0.35@xmath72 and that of @xmath73 is 0.0642@xmath74 .",
    "all these values quoted here are in the usual units of @xmath33 . thus such large experimental uncertainty would obviously affect the actual experimental value .",
    "secondly for some of these 14 cases , the adopted @xmath0 values are themselves negligibly small , and accordingly any good agreement in such cases may not be feasible to achieve . just to cite few such examples for which the adopted @xmath0 values being very small are 0.0096@xmath75 , 0.00373@xmath76 and 0.060@xmath77 in case of @xmath78 , and @xmath79 respectively . in view of these two aspects",
    "we can very well say , that the quality of agreement of our model predictions for @xmath0 with the newly adopted data is rather excellent .",
    "thus , more or less we see that our predictions made in our gde model both for @xmath2 and @xmath0 very well stand the test of reliability and thereby support once again the goodness of the gde model .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to say that our main concern in the present work is to identify possible occurrence of large deformations for some of the even - even nuclides lying in the n- and p - rich regions of the nuclear chart from our extensive predictions for the reduced quadrupole transition probability @xmath0 and the complementary excitation energy @xmath2 .",
    "we have made these predictions using our recently developed generalized differential equation model for these two physical quantities .",
    "these predictions include the hitherto unknown data for the nuclides lying adjacent to the already known data - regions of raman et al .",
    "@xcite for most of the even - even isotopes of oxygen to fermium ( z=8 to 100 ) . for sake of facilitating our desired task ,",
    "we have also included in our calculation values of the model - dependent deformation parameters such as @xmath3 , the ratio of @xmath3 to the weisskopf single - particle @xmath4 and and the intrinsic electric quadrupole moment @xmath5 using the predicted values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in this regard , our critical analysis of the resulting data convincingly support possible existence of large collectivity and the consequent exotic deformations for the nuclides @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath3 for all these nuclei mostly exceeds 0.3 and even lies in the range 0.45 - 0.55 for some of them like @xmath80 , @xmath7 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "such large collectivity is well supported by the corresponding relatively smaller values of the supplementary physical quantity , namely , the excitation energy e2 .",
    "the e2 values mostly lie in the range 0.35 - 1.4 mev for these nuclei in the low- and medium - mass region , while the same in heavy - mass region lie in the range 0.07 - 0.5 mev .",
    "even some of the available experimental data in this regard do lie in the range 0.7 - 1.1 mev .",
    "our prediction of strong deformation in case of @xmath84 and @xmath42 in fact are in close agreement with the experimental observation by yanagisawa et al.@xcite and iwasaki et al .",
    "@xcite respectively leading to the existence of the `` island of inversion '' caused by breaking of the n=20 shell - closure by the intruder states from the pf - shell@xcite .",
    "similar predictions in case of @xmath85 , @xmath86 also agree with the experimental findings@xcite again leading to the existence of another `` island of inversion '' caused by the breaking of the n=40 sub - shell closure by the intruder states from the gd - shell .",
    "thus such agreement with the experimental findings in the medium - low and medium mass nuclei in the exotic n - rich regions have made us to conjecture the existence of another `` island of inversion '' in the heavy - mass region possibly caused by breaking of the n=70 sub - shell closure by the intruder states from the hfp - shell as we find strong deformation for the nuclides @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus it appears that the existence of such `` islands of inversion '' in the exotic n - rich regions of the nuclear chart may be a general feature of nuclear dynamics waiting for to be explored by future experiments .",
    "in fact analysis@xcite of two two - neutron separation energy systematics derived from mass predictions in the inm model of atomic nuclei supports the existence of such islands in the heavy - mass n - rich region of the nuclear chart apart from the ones in the lower- and medium - mass regions .    apart from serving the primary purpose of the present work in predicting exotic deformations in the exotic regions of the nuclear chart as highlighted above",
    ", we also observe rather good agreement of our predictions with the adopted experimental data .",
    "even our model could reproduce the sharply changing isotopic variations of the two physical quantities @xmath0 and e2 in agreement with those of experiment , vindicating our assertion that the recursion relations ( [ b2f ] , [ b2b ] ) derived in the model should not be treated as interpolation or extrapolation formulas . in this regard",
    "the interconnecting relations connecting the neighboring elements having proton number z , z-2 and z+2 facilitate achieving this .",
    "this supplements our earlier observation of good agreement with experiment while developing@xcite the model .    even to our satisfaction",
    ", we could further succeed in establishing the goodness of the model in comparing some of our predictions with the latest experimental data @xcite which we have not included in our prediction process . in this respect",
    "it is quite remarkable to find , that the quality of agreement of our predictions for both these two physical quantities @xmath0 and @xmath2 is rather excellent .",

    "<S> we identify here possible occurrence of large deformations in the neutron- and proton - rich regions of the nuclear chart from extensive predictions of the values of the reduced quadrupole transition probability @xmath0 for the transition from the ground state to the first @xmath1 state and the corresponding excitation energy @xmath2 of even - even nuclei in the recently developed generalized differential equation model exclusively meant for these physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> this is made possible from our analysis of the predicted values of these two physical quantities and the corresponding deformation parameters derived from them such as the quadrupole deformation @xmath3 , the ratio of @xmath3 to the weisskopf single - particle @xmath4 and the intrinsic electric quadruplole moment @xmath5 , calculated for a large number of both known as well as hitherto unknown even - even isotopes of oxygen to fermium ( z=8 to 100 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our critical analysis of the resulting data convincingly support possible existence of large collectivity for the nuclides @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whose values of @xmath3 are found to exceed 0.3 and even 0.4 in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> our findings of large deformations in the exotic neutron - rich regions support the existence of another `` island of inversion '' in the heavy - mass region possibly caused by breaking of the n=70 sub - shell closure .     </S>",
