    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite which postulates a remarkable duality between large @xmath0 quantum field theories and gravitational dynamics , provides a useful theoretical laboratory to address questions underlying the dynamics of these systems . not only has it proven useful to obtain quantitative information about the dynamics of strongly coupled field theories , but it also provides a unique perspective into the geometrization of field theoretic concepts .    since the early days of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence it has been known that the radial direction of the bulk spacetime encodes in some sense the energy scale of the dual field theory @xcite .",
    "while the nature of this map is not terribly precise outside of the simple example of pure geometry ( dual to the vacuum state of the field theory ) , it nevertheless provides valuable intuition about certain basic aspects of effective field theory dynamics @xcite , and has led to the idea of the holographic renormalisation group @xcite , which relates the radial ` evolution ' in ads to rg flows in field theories .",
    "more recently this idea has been exploited to geometrize wilson s concept of integrating out momentum shells to generate field theory effective actions , in terms of integrating out regions of the bulk geometry which in turn lead to effective multi - trace boundary conditions on the cut - off surface , a fixed radial slice ( in some preferred foliation ) in ads @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of this holographic wilsonian approach was the emergence of multi - trace deformations of the field theory even in the planar limit , consistent with field theory expectation .",
    "a natural question in this context is what does this rg flow mean for the gravitational equations of motion ?",
    "more precisely , consider the problem of integrating out radial geometric shells in einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant ( which is a consistent truncation of string theory / supergravity ) .",
    "one anticipates based on the standard dictionary which relates the bulk metric to the boundary energy momentum tensor to obtain a scale dependent effective action for the energy momentum tensor , containing arbitrarily high multi - traces of the stress tensor .",
    "the reason for the generation of these multi - traces is clear , once one factors in the intrinsic non - linearity of gravity .",
    "the basic equations in this context are of course easy to write down ; as explained in @xcite the flow is driven by the radial adm hamiltonian and one can in principle solve the resulting hamilton - jacobi like equation for the effective action on the cut - off hypersurface . despite the conceptual simplicity of the formulation of wilsonian rg in terms of geometric effective actions",
    ", the point still remains that gravity s intrinsic non - linearity makes explicit solutions hard to come by .",
    "one can ask whether there is a tractable sector of the gravitational flow equations which leads to new insight . a natural avenue for exploration",
    "is suggested by the long - wavelength regime where we restrict attention to fluctuations of low frequency in the field theory directions . as evidenced by the fluid / gravity correspondence",
    "@xcite there is an essential simplification in this regime ; bulk einstein s equations can be explicitly solved order by order in a long - wavelength expansion along the boundary . as such one should be able to use this framework in conjunction with the fluid dynamical expansion to derive an effective action for the low frequency degrees of freedom which live on a cut - off surface in the interior of the ads spacetime . rather than tackle this problem directly we will take a slightly different tack in this paper , one which we believe clarifies some aspects of evolution in the radial direction and its possible connection to rg flows .",
    "one of our main conclusions will be that imposing rigid cut - offs in ads is more naturally viewed in terms of perturbing the cft by some non - local deformation or equivalently by introducing explicit state - dependent sources in the boundary theory .",
    "a second motivation is the recent work @xcite which derives an explicit map between solutions of vacuum einstein equations ( with no cosmological constant ) and those of incompressible navier - stokes equations , thereby making direct contact with some of the ideas of the black hole membrane paradigm in asymptotically flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "this problem , which has been further generalized in @xcite , is the zero cosmological constant analog of the problem we consider ( see also @xcite for another approach and @xcite for related work ) . the idea is to consider a fixed timelike hypersurface with dirichlet data enforcing a flat metric on the slice .",
    "given these boundary conditions one wants to solve vacuum einstein equations so as to obtain a solution which has a regular future horizon .. the boundary conditions chosen in @xcite are such that no disturbance propagates into the bulk spacetime from @xmath1 . ] by explicit construction which involves long wavelength fluctuations around flat space in a rindler patch the authors of @xcite construct solutions to vacuum einstein s equations order by order in a perturbation expansion in gradients along the hypersurface directions .",
    "the resulting geometry has a regular rindler horizon , and one obtains a regular solution to einstein s equations contingent on the fact that dynamics of the induced stress tensor on the hypersurface satisfies the incompressible navier - stokes equations .    while this development is fascinating , one is hampered from a first principles understanding of the physics from a holographic viewpoint , owing to the rather poorly understood concepts of flat space holography .",
    "moreover , given the connection between fluid dynamics ( albeit relativistic and conformal ) and einstein s equations with negative cosmological constant as described by the aforementioned fluid / gravity correspondence @xcite(and its non - relativistic extension in @xcite ) , it is interesting to ask whether the construction in @xcite can be obtained as a limit of the fluid / gravity map .",
    "if this is possible , one can then look for the field theoretic interpretation of the flat space problem .",
    "motivated by these issues , we consider a region of the ads spacetime bounded by a timelike hypersurface @xmath2 at some radial position , say @xmath3 in the supergravity limit of ads / cft .",
    "we are interested in solving for the bulk dynamics where will give ourselves the freedom to specify boundary conditions on @xmath2 . the second boundary condition ( which is necessary to zero - in onto a unique solution )",
    "will be specified by demanding regularity in the interior of the spacetime .",
    "we have schematically depicted the set - up in . in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "the specification of the problem thus is tantamount to solving classical partial differential equations ( pdes ) in ads with a dirichlet boundary condition imposed on various fields at the hypersurface @xmath2 .",
    "the question we would like to know the answer to is simply : `` what is the problem that we are solving in the cft language ? ''     where we impose boundary conditions on the fields .",
    "the solutions will further be constrained by requiring that they be regular on any putative horizon @xmath4 ( shown in the figure ) or the origin .",
    "the question we are after is what is the boundary image of this dirichlet data ? ]    ( 0,0 ) ( -4.8,1.36)@xmath2 ( -8.4,2.3)@xmath4 ( -5.24,-0,36)data = @xmath5 ( -1.7,-0.36)data = @xmath6    as we have reviewed above , various results exist in literature that suggest that solving such a dirichlet problem is analogous to some kind of rg from the cft point of view . despite the strongly suggestive nature of this holographic rg point of view , it is also not very clear what kind of an rg is one speaking of within a cft .",
    "a - priori , for one , it does not seem like the rg flow that arises from cutting off a cft a la wilson is the correct way to dualize the dirichlet problem . hence , our question - what is the cft dual of a bulk dirichlet problem ? to infinity , we will soon see that the bulk dirichlet problem induces different boundary conditions at infinity when the surface @xmath2 is retained at a finite position and it therefore pays to maintain the distinction . ]    as a warm - up we first consider the bulk dirichlet problem for linear pdes , using the simple setting of a klein - gordon field propagating in a cut - off ads spacetime . in this case",
    "it is not hard to see that one is deforming the field theory by a non - local double - trace operator , whose precise form , we argue , can be extracted by suitable convolution of appropriate bulk - to - boundary propagators .    we then turn to the issue of setting up the problem in a gravitational setting , outlining it in general before moving on to the tractable setting of the fluid / gravity regime . in the long wavelength regime",
    "we will argue that the bulk dirichlet problem reduces to a particular forcing of the fluid on the boundary of the asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "the fluid / gravity correspondence was generalized to fluids propagating on curved backgrounds with slowly varying curvatures in @xcite and the most general solutions which will prove to be of interest to us were presented in @xcite . using these results",
    "it transpires that we can immediately write down the solution to the bulk dirichlet problem in the long wavelength regime .",
    "the logic is the following : we wish to prescribe on the hypersurface @xmath7 a lorentzian metric which we denote as @xmath8 .",
    "this is arbitrary subject to the requirement that its curvatures be slowly varying so that we can treat it with the fluid / gravity perturbation scheme .",
    "we then solve einstein s equations demanding regularity in the interior of the spacetime . using standard intuition from the ads / cft correspondence",
    "it can be argued that the seed geometry which we need to set up the gradient expansion should simply be a black hole geometry which has a regular future event horizon , which furthermore satisfies the prescribed dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "it is not hard to see that such a seed solution is obtained by simply performing a coordinate transformation of the well known planar schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "but this is precisely the set - up of @xcite , the only difference being the fact that in these works the dirichlet data is imposed on the boundary at @xmath9 .",
    "let s call this boundary metric @xmath10 , which is also by definition slowly varying etc .. the solution to the asymptotic dirichlet problem is characterized by the boundary metric @xmath10 , a distinguished velocity field @xmath11 ( which is unit normalized ) and a scalar function @xmath12 ( determining the temperature or equivalently the local energy density ) .",
    "let us denote these variables collectively as @xmath6 .",
    "the boundary brown - york stress tensor ( up to counter - terms ) takes the fluid dynamical form and is built out of the data contained in @xmath6 .",
    "now given the space of solutions to the asymptotic dirichlet problem , we can reparametrize that space of solutions appropriately to obtain the solutions of the new bulk dirichlet problem .",
    "the only condition we have to satisfy is that the induced metric on @xmath2 in the solutions obtained this way which is being adjusted so as to agree with the dirichlet boundary conditions . ]",
    "be equal to @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we can extract the stress tensor on @xmath2 .",
    "we will argue that there is a corresponding velocity field @xmath13 ( normalized with respect to the hypersurface metric ) and a scalar function ( the hypersurface temperature ) , which parameterize the stress tensor of the hypersurface , which not surprisingly takes the fluid dynamical form .",
    "the main novelty is that the stress tensor does not however correspond to that of a conformal fluid .",
    "the introduction of an explicit scale by way of the dirichlet surface s location engenders a non - vanishing trace , which curiously evolves in a highly suggestive manner under change of cut - off surface position , see .",
    "calling the totality of the data on the hypersurface @xmath14 we further show that within the gradient expansion there is a one - to - one correspondence between the hypersurface data and the boundary data ; @xmath15 is bijective .",
    "this then has the advantage that we can immediately understand the boundary dual of the bulk dirichlet problem as a conformal fluid which is placed on a and @xmath16 , as in .",
    "this is a pre - specified constitutive relation for the boundary metric in terms of the fluid variables , not unlike the constitutive relation for the energy momentum tensor .",
    "we will call such a constitutive relation coming from bulk dirichlet problem as the dirichlet constitutive relation .",
    "the fluid at the boundary , therefore , sees a dynamic metric background but no new degrees of freedom are introduced and hence for example , there are no boundary einstein s equations that need to be solved . ] ` dynamical background ' whose metric depends on the same set of variables that characterizes the fluid itself ( in addition to the prescribed hypersurface metric ) .",
    "so from the boundary viewpoint there is a complete mixing between intrinsic and extrinsic data , which is the long - wavelength non - linear analog of the double trace deformation seen for the scalar toy model .",
    "moreover , this solution allows us to see that the dynamics of the fluid on the dirichlet surface , as given by the conservation equation on @xmath2 , ` emerges ' as collective dynamics of the boundary cft . in particular , the boundary fluid lives on a ` dynamical background ' , and the effects of the background can be suitably subsumed into the fluid description .",
    "this suggests that the correct way to think about the hypersurface physics is in terms of a ` dressed fluid ' living on an inert geometry .",
    "thus , the effective description of a fluid on this dynamical background is geometrically encapsulated in terms of the dirichlet hypersurface dynamics .    examining the resulting dynamics on @xmath2 we find that the hypersurface or effective fluid suffers from a possible pathology for @xmath17 smaller than some critical value @xmath18 . at @xmath18 the sound mode of the effective",
    "fluid starts to propagate outside the inert background @xmath2 s light - cone .",
    "we suggest that in the cft , this effect is due to the extreme forcing of the fluid on the boundary by the ` dynamical ' metric , and moreover propose that one can obtain sensible dynamics by projecting out the sound mode .",
    "this involves looking at the fluid at a scaling limit and this can be formalized as taking the incompressible non - relativistic limit of the fluid on the hypersurface in a manner entirely analogous to the scaling limit described in for generic relativistic fluids in @xcite .",
    "having understood the dirichlet problem for generic @xmath2 away from the horizon @xmath4 , we then proceed to push this surface deeper into the spacetime and ask what happens as we approach the horizon . in this",
    "regime @xmath2 dynamics continues to be described by incompressible navier - stokes equations in the limit , though with some slight differences from the bmw limit mentioned above .",
    "zooming in onto the region between @xmath2 and the horizon , we provide an embedding of the construction of @xcite into the fluid / gravity correspondence @xcite .",
    "further , we demonstrate that in this limit both the bulk metric in the region between @xmath2 and the boundary , and the boundary metric degenerate from metrics on a lorentzian manifold to newton - cartan like structures .",
    "this raises interesting questions about the natural emergence of the galilean structures in the ads / cft correspondence which we postpone for future work .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in we first address the dirichlet problem for a scalar field propagating in using this linear problem to build intuition . in",
    "we pose the bulk dirichlet problem for gravity in spacetime and solve it in the long wavelength approximation borrowing heavily on the results from the fluid / gravity correspondence .",
    "the remainder of the paper is then devoted to understanding the physics of our construction in various regimes : demonstrates how the dirichlet surface dynamics , as governed by the conservation equation , arises from the boundary physics .",
    "aided by this we argue that the dirichlet dynamics is probably pathological past a critical radius and propose a non - relativistic scaling of the resulting fluid a la bmw in to cure this possible pathology . finally , in we study the near - horizon dirichlet problem and make contact with the recent work on the flat space dirichlet problem ( and its connection with navier - stokes equations ) .",
    "we end with a discussion in .",
    "various appendices contain useful technical results .",
    "in particular , to aid the reader we provide a comprehensive glossary of our conventions and key formulae in . this",
    "is followed by a complete ` dirichlet dictionary ' relating hypersurface variables to boundary variables in for ready reference .    _",
    "note added : _ while this work being completed we received @xcite which has partial overlap with the results presented in .",
    "these authors also attempt to solve for bulk geometries with prescribed boundary conditions on @xmath2 in the long wavelength regime and interpret their results in terms of a rg flow of fluid dynamics .",
    "_ note added in v2 : _ in the first version of the paper the non - relativistic metrics quoted in and in were incorrect ; the metrics as presented do not solve the bulk einstein s equations to the desired order .",
    "these are now corrected in the current version .",
    "however , the full set of terms that we need to include in order to see the naiver - stokes equation on the boundary is quite large .",
    "hence in the main text we only report the results for the case where the non - relativistic fluid moves on a ricci flat spatial manifold in and present the general results in a new appendix .",
    "we note that the results of also correct the expressions originally derived in @xcite .",
    "to set the stage for the discussion let us consider setting up the bulk dirichlet problem for linear pdes in an asymptotically spacetime . as a canonical example we will consider the dynamics of a probe scalar field @xmath19 of mass @xmath20 . generalizations to other linear wave equations such as the free maxwell equation are straightforward .",
    "we will let this scalar field propagate on a background asymptotically geometry with spatio - temporal translational symmetries so that the background metric can be brought to the form @xmath21 the boundary of the spacetime is at @xmath22 and we will assume that the boundary metric is the minkowski metric on @xmath23 for simplicity , so that asymptotically @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( as @xmath26 ) .",
    "the dynamical equation of motion for the scalar is the free klein - gordon equation which can be written as an ode in the radial direction for the fourier modes @xmath27 of @xmath19 @xmath28 and takes the form @xmath29 as a second order equation we need to specify two boundary conditions .",
    "we are going to restrict attention to the finite part of the geometry as illustrated in and impose dirichlet boundary conditions for the field at some hypersurface @xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "the second boundary condition in general can take the form of a regularity boundary condition in the interior of the spacetime . if we were working in a spacetime with a horizon",
    "this would demand that the mode functions of interest are purely ingoing at the future horizon .",
    "the question we wish to pose is the following : usually in an asymptotically spacetime we know that the solution to the scalar wave equation above has two linearly independent modes with power - law fall - off characterized by the source @xmath30 and vev @xmath31 of the dual boundary operator @xmath32 ( which we recall is a conformal primary ) .",
    "we wish to ask what is the characterization of the boundary data as a functional of the dirichlet hypersurface data . in this simple linear problem",
    "it is easy to see that there is a one - one map between the two sets of data .",
    "essentially we are asking how to tune @xmath30 and @xmath31 so that the value of the scalar field on the dirichlet hypersurface at @xmath33 takes on its given value .    while it is possible to derive a formal answer to the above question , it is useful to first visit the simple setting of pure spacetime where we have the luxury of being able to solve the scalar wave - equation explicitly to see an explicit answer to the question .",
    "we specialize our consideration to the pure geometry where @xmath34 and @xmath35 and one has enhanced lorentz symmetry on the constant @xmath36 slices .",
    "the wave equation simplifies to @xmath37 this is well known to have solutions in terms of bessel functions , but we will proceed to examine the behavior in a gradient expansion to set the stage for the real problem of interest later .",
    "the translationally invariant solution of the massive klein - gordon equation in the bulk is @xmath39 where the dual primary has a scaling dimension @xmath40 obeying @xmath41 along with a source @xmath30 and a normalized vev where @xmath42 is the gravitational constant in ads@xmath43 . ]",

    "for simplicity , we will assume @xmath47 and choose @xmath20 such that @xmath48 to avoid complications with logarithms .",
    "extension to @xmath49 $ ] with the lower end of the interval saturating the unitary bound is possible with the added complication of taking proper account of the necessary boundary terms .",
    "we will begin by rewriting this solution in terms of the quantities on the dirichlet surface which we denote with a hat to distinguish them from the boundary data : @xmath50_{r\\to r_d}=j_\\phi+ \\frac{\\phi}{(2\\nu)\\,r_d^{2\\nu } } \\ , \\label{j0}\\ ] ] @xmath51_{r\\to r_d } = \\phi \\ . \\label{ph0}\\ ] ]    since the transformation between the data on the boundary @xmath52 and that on the hypersurface @xmath53 is linear it is a simple matter to write the bulk solution in terms of the hypersurface variables .",
    "one simply has @xmath54 this is the answer we seek and all that remains is to interpret this result .",
    "it is now easy to notice that the imposition of the dirichlet condition on a hypersurface inside the bulk is equivalent to making the boundary source a specific function of the vev . from",
    "we can read off the specific deformation of the boundary cft action to be given by @xmath55 which happens to be an irrelevant double - trace deformation @xcite of the boundary cft .",
    "hence , at least in this simple setup the dual of the dirichlet problem is to make the source of a primary @xmath32 a particular joint function of the vev of the primary in the given state and another fixed ( state - independent ) auxiliary source .",
    "having seen the result for the translationally invariant case @xmath38 , we now proceed with @xmath58 .",
    "it is well known that general solution to the wave equation is given in terms of bessel functions which we parameterize as .",
    "results for time - like momenta follow from replacing @xmath59 by @xmath60 and using the bessel relations",
    "@xmath61\\gamma(-\\nu+1 ) x^{\\nu}j_{\\nu}(2x)\\\\ \\frac{\\gamma(\\nu)}{2(ix)^{\\nu}}\\ , i_{\\nu}(2ix ) & = \\frac{\\gamma(\\nu)}{2x^{\\nu}}j_{\\nu}(2x)\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] ] @xmath62 note that our previous result for @xmath38 follows from just keeping the leading @xmath63 terms in the expansions @xmath64 for a general @xmath59 , we can repeat the analysis of the previous section . while this can be done generally at all orders in @xmath59 with some work , for simplicity we will resort to derivative expansion keeping terms upto order @xmath57 .",
    "not only will this allow us to see some of the structures emerging explicitly , but it also sets the stage for our gravitational computation in later sections .",
    "using the expansion above , we have @xmath65 with the ellipses representing order @xmath66 terms and higher .",
    "the source at the intermediate surface is as before easily determined @xmath67_{r\\to r_d}\\\\ & =   ( j_\\phi)_k \\left(1-\\frac{1}{(2\\nu-2 ) } \\frac{k^2}{2\\,r_d^2}+\\ldots + \\frac{\\gamma(-\\nu)}{\\gamma(\\nu)}\\left(\\frac{k}{2r_d}\\right)^{2\\nu}\\left\\{1 + \\frac{1}{(2\\nu+2 ) } \\frac{k^2}{2\\,r_d^2}+\\ldots\\right\\}\\right)\\\\ & \\qquad \\qquad + \\frac{\\phi_k}{(2\\nu)\\ , r_d^{2\\nu}}\\left(1 + \\frac{2\\nu}{(2\\nu+2)^2 } \\frac{k^2}{2\\,r_d^2}+\\ldots \\right )   \\end{split } \\label{j2}\\ ] ] while the normalized vev of the primary to this order in derivative expansion can be determined after subtracting an appropriate counter - term as terms and higher , one needs to subtract appropriate counter - terms at that order .",

    "the key feature to note from the above analysis , is that the expression for the boundary source @xmath30 is non - analytic in @xmath59 and hence non - local when fourier - transformed back to position space .",
    "hence , we see that in general we have a map between the non - local double trace deformation on the boundary and the dirichlet data on @xmath2 ( similar non - local double - trace deformations were explored earlier in @xcite ) .      from the analysis of the free scalar wave equation in the picture",
    "is rather clear . in the cft ,",
    "in general one can make the source a non - local functional of the vev of the primary operator .",
    "usually such a function can be fed into the holographic dictionary via a ` state - dependent ' boundary condition , which whilst somewhat unnatural from a field theory is a perfectly sensible boundary condition to consider .",
    "for some special classes of functionals , this state - dependent boundary condition has a very simple bulk interpretation as a dirichlet boundary condition imposed on an intermediate surface , implying that we can trade the non - locality of the boundary sources into local behavior at some lower radius .",
    "we just have one further question to answer before we declare victory : how do we in practice determine this special set of sources in various holographic setups ?",
    "for the general backgrounds we can formally write the solution to the wave equations in terms of integrals over the dirichlet data convolved with suitable ` dirichlet bulk to boundary propagators ' , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the former propagates the information contained in @xmath77 to the boundary source , while the latter allows determination of the contribution from the vev @xmath78 on @xmath2 , i.e. , formally @xmath79 note that implicit in our definition of these dirichlet bulk to boundary propagators is the information of the boundary condition in the interior of the geometry and the necessary counter - terms .",
    "while it is possible to work this out in more specific geometries , such as a schwarzschild - ads@xmath43 spacetime to see the interplay of these ir boundary conditions , we will leave this toy problem for now , and proceed to analyze the more interesting case of gravitational dynamics in wherein we do have to face - up with non - linearities of the equations of motion .",
    "close to the poincar horizon ; in this limit it seems natural to expect that the asymptotically we obtain a a neumann boundary condition .",
    "we thank don marolf for emphasizing this to us . ]    before proceeding to the gravitational setting , however , let us make a few pertinent observations relevant to the motivation mentioned at the beginning of .",
    "the result we have obtained is quite intuitive ; demanding that our fields take on the desired value at @xmath2 entails a linear relation between the two pieces of data at infinity , thereby leading to the observation about the source depending on the vev .",
    "we also see that despite some superficial resemblance to the wilsonian rg flow where too one encounters multi - trace operators there is a crucial distinction in the physics . in the formulation of",
    "@xcite one finds that for fixed asymptotic data , upon integrating out the region of the geometry between the boundary and a cut - off surface ( which we can for simplicity take to be @xmath2 for the sake of discussion ) one obtains an effective action for a cut - off field theory living on @xmath2 with scale dependent sources .",
    "these are irrelevant double traces ( which are the only terms generated in a gaussian theory which the linear models under discussion are ) , and one obtains the @xmath80-functions for the double trace couplings along the flow . in the present context",
    "however what we have is a situation wherein we are forced to engineer a specific double trace deformation on the boundary so as to ensure that we satisfy the dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath2 .",
    "this is conceptually different from usual notions of rg , where one does not conventionally consider state dependent boundary conditions in the uv .",
    "however , there is a sense in which renormalisation of sources takes place which will become quite clear when we look at the gravitational problem .",
    "having understood the boundary meaning of the dirichlet problem for probe fields in a fixed background , we now turn to the situation where we consider dynamical gravity in the bulk .",
    "while we could consider other matter degrees of freedom in the bulk whose backreaction we now have to take into account , we choose for simplicity to restrict attention to the dynamics in the pure gravity sector which , as is well known , is a consistent truncation of the supergravity equations of motion . from a field theory perspective , we are going to work in the planar limit and focus on the dynamics of a single operator , the stress tensor and its source , the cft metric @xmath10 .",
    "first of all one should ask what does it mean to consider the dirichlet problem at a fixed hypersurface in the bulk when gravity is dynamical .",
    "we will take the view that the location of the hypersurface @xmath2 is specified by a scalar function on the bulk manifold @xmath81 .",
    "we want to determine the metric on this spacetime by solving the dynamical equations of motion subject to the boundary condition on the prescribed hypersurface . to wit , we demand that @xmath81 be endowed with a lorentzian metric @xmath82 which solves einstein s equations with a negative cosmological constant",
    ". the equations of motion are ( in units where @xmath83 ) @xmath84 we will adapt coordinates @xmath85 to the hypersurface @xmath2 and take this distinguished surface to be at @xmath3 with intrinsic coordinates @xmath86 . we impose the boundary condition @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the dirichlet data we wish to specify . to complete the specification of the problem",
    "we should impose some boundary condition in the interior of the spacetime , which we will canonically take to be a regularity condition .",
    "the scaling by @xmath89 above whilst unconventional from the bulk perspective , is more natural in the ads / cft context for it makes it easy to compare with the case where we push the hypersurface to the boundary .",
    "the general problem as stated above is quite hard . for one",
    "it is not clear that for generic choices of dirichlet data one obtains a solution compatible with regularity in the interior of the spacetime .",
    "while a local solution in an open neighbourhood of @xmath2 can presumably be obtained by adapting a fefferman - graham like expansion , one is unlikely to be able to gain much insight using this procedure .",
    "moreover , given that the map between @xmath2 and the boundary is expected to be non - local ( borrowing intuition from the linear problem ) one wonders whether there are causality issues as well .",

    "as we will see this limit has the added advantage that it naturally allows us to make contact with the metric derived in @xcite .",
    "the idea as explained beautifully in @xcite is the following : every relativistic fluid has a scaling limit where we freeze out the propagating sound mode , which drives the fluid into a non - relativistic regime , while simultaneously making it incompressible .",

    "so far in our discussion the dirichlet hypersurface @xmath2 has been located at some radial position @xmath17 that is finite .",
    "we now want to investigate what happens as we push this surface closer towards the horizon , i.e , @xmath266 via @xmath267 . to understand the resulting physics we first have to realize that we are doing something strange : the horizon is a null surface and has therefore a degenerate metric .",
    "@xmath2 on the other hand is constrained to be a timelike surface with a non - degenerate metric .",
    "so it is clear that demanding a well - behaved metric is going to result in an infinite scaling by the red - shift factor @xmath151 ; the main question is whether one can implement the scaling while retaining interesting dynamics .",
    "we will now proceed to show that there exists a scaling of parameters such that the near - horizon geometry makes sense .",
    "furthermore , we argue that this allows us to embed the flat space constructions of @xcite into our ads set - up .",
    "we outline the construction in a couple of stages to guide intuition : firstly in we will examine the conservation equation on the hypersurface and from there infer the scaling of parameters . this is the only sensible thing to do for us , since the entire dynamical system of the boundary cft fluid has been converted into that of the hypersurface fluid living on an inert background .",
    "we then examine the consequences of the scalings we derive in focussing on the region close to the horizon ; this amounts to blowing up the region of spacetime between @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "this blown up region bears close resemblance to the solution of the vacuum einstein s equations dual to the incompressible navier - stokes system discussed in @xcite .",
    "indeed one should anticipate this based on the usual intuition that near any non - degenerate horizon one encounters a patch of the rindler geometry .",
    "however , we will also encounter differences owing to the fact at the end of the day we are solving with a non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "there is also the further question of what the geometry between the dirichlet surface and the asymptotic ads region looks like and moreover what is the boundary physics of our scalings ?",
    "we argue in that the near horizon scaling regime renders the bulk metric viewed as a lorentzian metric on a spacetime manifold nonsensical . however , it turns out that there is a nice language to describe the geometry in terms newton - cartan structures and we show that the bulk co - metric ( which in usual lorentzian geometry is the inverse metric ) is well behaved as is the boundary co - metric .",
    "the result is quite satisfying from the physical perspective : the near horizon limit demands a drastic modification of the boundary metric , which forces one into a non - relativistic or galilean regime .",
    "consequently , rather than describing geometry in terms of lorentzian structure , we are forced to use the less familiar but equally effective geometrization of the idea of a galilean spacetime , in terms of newton - cartan geometry ( see @xcite for a nice account of this subject and @xcite for a more recent review ) .      to understand the behavior of the fluid on the dirichlet surface as we push @xmath2 closer to the horizon , we first look at the conservation equation in this limit .",
    "it turns out that demanding non - trivial dynamics on the dirichlet surface forces one into a scaling regime of the fluid , effectively making it non - relativistic .",
    "however , the scaling we encounter is not quite the bmw scaling @xcite discussed earlier in but a slightly modified version of the same .",
    "ignoring for the moment the fact for @xmath268 we are supposed to be projecting out the sound mode to ensure subluminal propagation on the dirichlet hypersurface , let us write the relativistic conservation equations and examine them as we zoom in towards the horizon .",
    "consider then the conservation equation on the dirichlet hypersurface ; we have analyzed this from a generic viewpoint in but for now we will focus on the truncated equations to second order by setting @xmath269 ( cf . , ) .",
    "projecting these conservation equations parallel and transverse to the velocity we get ( using @xmath135 as given in ) @xmath270 we are going to try to analyze these equations in the limit when @xmath271 .    from it is clear that if we insist on leaving the hypersurface data independent of @xmath151 then we find that we have contributions at different orders that need to be independently cancelled .",
    "the most constraining equation is the @xmath272 term from the transverse equation which demands that the spatial gradients of @xmath12 vanish .",
    "then at @xmath273 we have to kill the acceleration and have a non - trivial equation from the longitudinal part . at order @xmath274",
    "we would need to kill all terms that show up with the shear viscosity .",
    "the upshot is that we are left with vacuous dynamics on the dirichlet hypersurface should @xmath12 and @xmath275 be @xmath276 as @xmath271 .",
    "while this sounds a bit strange , a moments pause reveals that this is indeed what one should expect on physical grounds .",
    "the horizon of a black hole is a null surface ( it is generated by null generators ) and in the process of moving the dirichlet hypersurface to the horizon , we are effectively doing an infinite rescaling ( hence @xmath271 ) to bring the dirichlet metric @xmath90 to be timelike and non - degenerate . before we do such a rescaling however , we are in the ultra - relativistic regime as far as the horizon goes  in such a regime it is natural to expect that there is no dynamics , the fluid streams along the null generators and is effectively frozen into a stationary flow .",
    "it is then clear that in order to obtain non - trivial dynamics on the dirichlet surface one has to scale the fields @xmath12 and @xmath275 in some fashion .",
    "the crucial question is whether there is any scaling that retains non - trivial dynamics ; operationally demanding that we obtain an ` interesting ' non - linear equation .",
    "consider the following scaling : but we refrain from doing so for simplicity ( see end of ) . ]",
    "@xmath277 where the functions with subscript @xmath278 have specific functional form with anisotropic scaling of their spatial and temporal gradients .",
    "specifically , @xmath279 where we assign gradient weight @xmath280 to the spatial derivatives and @xmath281 to temporal derivatives .",
    "this is inspired of course by the non - relativistic bmw scaling discussed in and as discussed there the @xmath282 part of the velocity field is fixed by normalization .",
    "of ; this is the overall parameter that will organize for us the hierarchy necessary in the near horizon limit . ]",
    "however , there is a crucial difference from the bmw scaling ; the leading term in the expansion of @xmath283 is growing with @xmath284 , which seems to be an issue . nevertheless , it is easy to check that under this scaling ( which admittedly is obtained by demanding a sensible @xmath273 equation from the longitudinal part ) one finds that the equations can be reduced to : @xmath285 where we have specified to a flat minkowski background metric for specificity ( @xmath251 ) and to make the equations more familiar .",
    "these are of course , the unforced ( by background ) navier - stokes equations which we have earlier described via the bmw scaling in .",
    "the incompressibility condition as in that case arises from the longitudinal conservation equation at @xmath286 while the navier - stokes equation itself appears at @xmath287 .",
    "a similar scaling can be done for the forced navier - stokes system , we simply use the bmw scaling for the fluctuating part of the hypersurface metric .      how do we reconcile this scaling derived here for the relativistic fluid with that derived by bmw @xcite ?",
    "firstly , let s note that the rationale of our scaling up the background value of @xmath288 is that shear term survives the scaling . from the second equation of",
    "we clearly see that this is required in order to retain the shear term in the limit . on the other hand",
    "the non - relativistic pressure in the bmw limit is proportional to @xmath289 and in the near horizon limit both @xmath290 and @xmath291 diverge .",
    "the extra scaling down of @xmath292 ( over and above the scaling by @xmath293 ) is necessary to offset this divergence and ensure that the pressure gradient term contributes at the same order as the convective derivative @xmath294 and the shear .",
    "the effective pressure that enters into the equation is @xmath295 using the scaling of @xmath151 in so that the first term of the navier - stokes equation in is essentially @xmath296 .",
    "so the final equations of motion on the near horizon region for the hypersurface dynamics are simply : @xmath297 with kinematic viscosity @xmath298 we have here glossed over the fact that since we scale @xmath299 we potentially have a problem .",
    "the limit seems to suggest that we are taking the zero temperature limit of the black hole geometry since the hawking temperature ( which is seen on the boundary ) is @xmath300 .",
    "this naively sounds like we are outside the long wavelength regime and as a result should not be using the fluid / gravity map to describe the dirichlet problem .    a different way to say this from a dynamical equation of motion perspective",
    "is that the scalings were derived by demanding that the equations remained non - trivial , which operationally means that different terms appear to have inhomogeneous weights .",
    "hence by suitable fiddling of amplitudes and derivatives we engineered that terms which originally scaled as @xmath151 to various powers all contribute homogeneously .",
    "however , we have not analyzed the higher order contributions to the equations of motion .",
    "is it possible that relativistic two derivative terms in the stress tensor , which show up as the corrections to viscous relativistic hydrodynamics equations of show up at the same order ?",
    "note that this is not a problem for the case discussed in @xcite for they engineered their scalings about a fixed background temperature , and there were no stray factors of @xmath207 ( equivalently @xmath301 ) in ( in front of @xmath302 ) to augment higher order contributions .    for us to make the argument that the higher order terms are suppressed requires knowledge of the transport coefficients at second order on the dirichlet hypersurface .",
    "this is in principle calculable by extending the dirichlet fluid / gravity map of to one higher order in gradients .",
    "however , we will now argue that there is an essential simplification which allows us to make the statement boldly without computation .",
    "the rationale is simply that the enhanced scaling of the zero mode part of @xmath12 is compensated by the suppressing the corresponding fluctuation term @xmath303 so as to ensure that @xmath304 is finite .",
    "since the overall value of @xmath302 scales out in the non - relativistic regime ( we will see this clearly from implementing the scalings in the next subsection ) it can not affect the resulting equations .",
    "so we conjecture that accounting for higher order corrections as well , one will obtain as the leading order equations in the @xmath301 expansion ( all further corrections are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath301 ) .",
    "one physical way to motivate the correction is to first note that while the boundary temperature is being scaled to zero in the limit the hypersurface temperature can indeed be maintained to be finite : @xmath305",
    "so from the dirichlet observer s point of view there is still scope for a non - relativistic scaling , and in fact this is how the dirichlet observer would carry out the bmw regime .",
    "what is clear is that due to the extra red - shifting in translating to the boundary , the asymptotic observer is going to have trouble reconciling this near horizon scaling regime in his variables .",
    "we will return to this issue in .    in summary ,",
    "the non - relativistic incompressible navier - stokes equations determine the dynamics of the hypersurface fluid as @xmath2 approaches the horizon ; we will now proceed to investigate what this means for the various metrics : first we look at the bulk metric first and then examine what is the effect on the boundary .      from the discussion at the end of it seems natural that we should try to ask the question as to whether we can satisfy the constraints of the dirichlet problem in the region between @xmath2 and the horizon ( for the moment forgetting about the asymptotic region ) .",
    "clearly we have @xmath2 approaching the horizon , so we will be forced to consider a double - scaling regime where we zoom in close to the horizon and expand out the spacetime region in - between .",
    "let us temporarily ignore the consequences of this on the equations of motion and formally take the limit of the bulk metric given in , .    to zoom into the region between the horizon and @xmath2 , realizing that @xmath306 in the limit , we take : @xmath307 from which it follows that @xmath308    similarly we parametrize the position of our dirichlet hypersurface via @xmath309 both @xmath310 and @xmath311 are a measure of how close we are to the horizon after one has zoomed into the near horizon region . to relate them , we subtitute @xmath17 into the expression for @xmath151 and do a large @xmath301 expansion . identifying the leading term as @xmath311",
    ", we get @xmath312 we see that @xmath310 is same as the kinematic viscosity - hence , the @xmath313 limit is identical to the inviscid limit in hydrodynamics .    implementing this change of variables and the scaling in the bulk metric we obtain the near - horizon metric .",
    "in fact , the fastest way to derive the metric in is to utilize the fact that the near horizon limit is essentially the non - relativistic limit together with a particular form of the pressure fluctuations ; essentially we substitute @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 into along with the identification @xmath317 to ensure that we have the correct scalings .",

    "thus while the metric description might break down the co - metric description with its associated galilean structures continue to describe the bulk and the boundary geometry .",
    "now we present the co - metric as a function of the dirichlet data .",

    "contrast this with the bulk metric ( see ) whose large @xmath151 limit seems dubious .",
    "this supports our contention that there is a completely sensible description of the bulk and the boundary geometry in terms of co - metrics everywhere when we take the near - horizon dirichlet problem along with an incompressible limit on the dressed fluid .",
    "our exercise of rewriting the near - horizon bulk metric in terms of the non - relativistic variables can be repeated in the case of co - metric and we can easily convince ourselves that this goes through without any new subtleties .",
    "in fact , most terms in the above expression are sub - dominant in the @xmath301 expansion introduced in the previous subsections .",
    "in fact , at the zeroth order the spatial part of the co - metric is just that of vacuum ads ; with the temporal part contributing only at a higher order . the horizon structure encoded in @xmath359 is completely invisible until quite high orders in @xmath301 expansion , which is to be expected since the boundary temperature is being scaled to zero . to be specific using the scaling we find @xmath360 basically we seem to find that the co - metric description is mostly oblivious to the near - horizon geometry (",
    "which as we have seen is well - described in the metric description ) .",
    "hence , we are naturally led to an effective description where there are two regions of the geometry : one well - described by a metric , and another by a co - metric .",
    "the interesting question is to see whether there is an overlap region where the two descriptions are valid and the metric is just the inverse of the co - metric .",
    "having detained the reader for so long , we will leave the detailed answer of this question to future work .",
    "however , we would like to draw the attention of the reader to the following fact  the near - horizon limit of the dirichlet problem naturally seems to lead to novel geometric structures closely associated with the galilean limit .",
    "these galilean structures evidently call for more detailed studies especially since they might hold valuable lessons for non - relativistic holography ( as previously pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk dirichlet problem in , which we defined as the gravitational dynamics in a spacetime with negative cosmological constant , subject to dirichlet boundary conditions on a preferred timelike hypersurface @xmath2 , is interesting in the ads / cft context for several reasons .",
    "for one , it allows us to investigate questions in a cut - off ads spacetime which might be dual to a field theory with a rigid uv cut - off via the usual ads / cft dictionary .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to touch upon the ideas involving holographic renormalisation and the implementation of the wilsonian rg ideas in the gravitational description .",
    "the main motivation behind our work was to ask , what is it that one is doing on the dual field theory living on the boundary of the ads spacetime that ensures these dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath2 , and whether such a problem is always well - posed .    for linear systems in ads",
    "it is easy to see that there is a simple map between data on the hypersurface and that on the boundary . in particular ,",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath2 translate into non - local multi - trace deformations of the dual field theory .",
    "one can think of the boundary theory being deformed by some ` state dependent ' sources .",
    "such a boundary condition while seemingly bizarre from standard field theoretic perspective , has an effective description in terms of a much simpler and local source , which is the dirichlet data on @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we have further argued that such bulk dirichlet problems for full non - linear gravitational dynamics in are also amenable to solution in a certain long wavelength regime . using results from the fluid / gravity correspondence @xcite we have constructed the bulk spacetime resulting from the specification of a hypersurface metric on @xmath2 .",
    "the solution is contingent upon the hypersurface dynamics , as determined by the conservation of the stress tensor induced on @xmath2 , be conserved . in the long wavelength regime",
    "this stress tensor can be written as that of a non - conformal fluid propagating on the fixed geometry of @xmath2 .",
    "armed with such a solution we can examine the dual cft to determine how one is achieving the dirichlet dynamics .    in the long wavelength regime",
    "the boundary theory is described by fluid dynamics with what we term as dirichlet constitutive relations . in particular , while the stress tensor of the boundary fluid is of the conventional conformal fluid form , it lives on a background geometry whose metric is ` dynamical ' in the following sense : the boundary metric depends on the dynamical fluid degrees of freedom .",
    "one should think of this in terms of a fluid being subject to a gravitational potential well which is furthermore carried along with the fluid . a useful analogy is to think of a charge carrier in a polarizable medium .",
    "the medium or more precisely in our case the ` dynamical ' background exerts a force on the fluid .",
    "however , one can subsume the ` dynamical ' background s effect on the fluid , and rewrite the dynamics as that of a ` dressed fluid ' on a fixed background .",
    "this ` dressed fluid ' is a collective effect and moreover from the geometry we know what its description should be  it is simply the non - conformal fluid on the dirichlet surface .",
    "this can be independently verified by starting with the boundary fluid and the ` dynamical ' boundary metric and showing that the boundary conservation equation can be rewritten as the hypersurface conservation equation , thus deriving the non - conformal fluid stress tensor on @xmath2 .",
    "we also note that in the long wavelength regime because one is working order by order in boundary gradients , the boundary fluid is deformed locally  at any spacetime point the source @xmath10 depends only on the fluid degrees of freedom ( velocity and temperature ) at that point .",
    "this is what allows us to think of the fluid as carrying around with it a local gravitational cloud . from a formal point of view , the gravitational dirichlet problem involves turning on local multi - trace deformations for the field theory .    from the above discussion one is then tempted to say that the bulk geometry provides a way to repackage non - local deformations into a local perturbation at a lower radius or scale .",
    "this is highly suggestive of some sort of renormalisation of sources as one propagates boundary conditions into the bulk .",
    "let us compare this picture with the recent discussion of the holographic wilsonian rg flow idea of @xcite",
    ". in these works starting with a field theory with given sources for say just single trace operators in the planar theory , one derives an effective action containing not just renormalized single trace sources , but also multi - traces on some chosen cut - off surface .",
    "the flow equation governing the radial evolution of such sources was argued to arise by effectively integrating out a part of the bulk geometry between the boundary and the cut - off surface .",
    "it was also important for that discussion given the particularization to the wilsonian perspective that one does not prejudice oneself with the boundary conditions in the interior of the spacetime below the cut - off ( the infra - red of the field theory ) .",
    "in the current context we see that by transferring the boundary conditions onto the dirichlet surface we have shifted the burden of multi - traces onto the boundary  as described above there is a suitable set of non - local multi - trace deformations on the boundary which ` renormalizes ' into a single trace source on the cut - off . whilst this is not totally surprising for linear systems such as the scalar problem discussed in the text ,",
    "it is satisfying that a similar statement can be made for non - linear gravitational dynamics by invoking the long wavelength gradient expansion .",
    "we should however note that our discussion explicitly assumes knowledge of the interior ( infra - red ) boundary conditions ; in the fluid / gravity solutions constructed herein we have demanded that there be a regular future event horizon to single out a sensible solution .",
    "having obtained the effective dynamics on the hypersurface , we learnt that the conservation equations result in a sound mode which travels outside the light - cone of the fixed hypersurface metric once one pushes the surface too far into the interior . past this sonic threshold , it is probably not sensible to maintain a relativistic fluid description on @xmath2 .",
    "we argued that we should pass over into a non - relativistic regime , by a suitable scaling of fluid variables ( a la bmw @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the acausality manifesting itself in the sound mode of the hypersurface dynamics can be discerned ( without invoking the ` dressed ' picture ) from the boundary .",
    "more importantly , one wonders whether the gravitational dirichlet problem suffers from such pathologies in general .",
    "does one encounter any acausal behavior the moment the hypersurface is inside the bulk outside the long wavelength regime ?",
    "what about their validity where say stringy effects are taken into account ?",
    "can we engineer such a boundary condition consistently using objects like orientifolds in string theory ?",
    "what happens once we go beyond large n ? does the field theory with these non - local deformations make sense beyond large n for at least some subclass of these deformations ?",
    "what is the field theory interpretation of other kinds of boundary conditions other than dirichlet boundary conditions ( say if we fix the mean extrinsic curvature as proposed in @xcite ) ?",
    "these are fascinating questions which deserve to be explored further .    finally , by examining the dirichlet problem in the vicinity of the event horizon of the fluid / gravity solutions we made contact with the recent constructions of flat space gravitational duals to incompressible navier - stokes flows on a cut - off hypersurface @xcite , deriving in effect the membrane paradigm from the boundary field theory .",
    "focussing on a tiny sliver of the geometry between the horizon and @xmath2 leads to the long wavelength solution around the rindler horizon found in these works .",
    "this is reminiscent of the penrose limit ; while in the latter we focus on the geometry close to a null geodesic and blow it up , here we zoom close to a null surface and blow up the spacetime in its vicinity ( perhaps a better analogy is the near horizon limit of black d3-branes without any statement about decoupling ) .",
    "the process of blowing up the near horizon region dilutes away the cosmological constant ; hence rather than obtaining a solution to einstein s equations with negative cosmological constant we end up with a geometry that solves vacuum einstein s equations at leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "however , starting at higher orders we start to see the effect of the cosmological constant , revealing the throat region between the near - horizon rindler geometry and the asymptotic ads spacetime .    from our embedding of the construction of @xcite into the fluid / gravity correspondence @xcite",
    "we learn that the boundary fluid lives on a manifold with galilean / newton - cartan like structure in the near horizon limit .",
    "this degeneration of the lorentzian structure into an effective galilean one is what enforces the incompressible navier - stokes scaling from the viewpoint of the cft .",
    "one can simply say that the membrane paradigm is a particular galilean limit of the field theory .",
    "this perspective also clarifies the universality of the membrane paradigm  since we are zooming down to the rindler region in the vicinity of a non - extremal black hole horizon , we should expect the same geometry for any non - degenerate horizon",
    ". hence the dual description should always be in terms of an incompressible navier - stokes fluid as long as we deal with systems carrying only conserved charges @xcite . in the presence of other light degrees of freedom , as happens in systems with spontaneously broken symmetries , say the holographic superfluids discussed in @xcite we would have to project out all linearly dispersing modes to achieve the same .    in the near horizon limit we find that both the bulk metric and the boundary metric degenerate into a newton - cartan time - metric , but the co - metric is spacelike and well behaved .",
    "we speculate that the bulk spacetime in this limit should be described in two patches : the region between the horizon and the dirichlet hypersurface enjoys a description in terms of a conventional metric while the region between @xmath2 and the boundary requires use of the co - metrics and newton - cartan structures .",
    "we conclude that the language of galilean geometries is what is necessary to implement the membrane paradigm in the ads / cft correspondence .    the idea of implementing a galilean limit of ads / cft correspondence was proposed recently in @xcite who were also motivated by considerations involving the incompressible navier - stokes equations , which turn out to enjoy an enhanced symmetry algebra @xcite .",
    "it was argued there based on this algebra that appropriate newton - cartan manifold should correspond to an slice of the bulk spacetime . here in contrast",
    "we are retaining the entire manifold , not just the two dimensional slice .",
    "however , we achieve this at the expense of discarding the lorentzian metric structure , and work with a co - metric and a time co - vector .    clearly",
    "the role of galilean / newton - cartan structures in the context of ads / cft requires further investigation .",
    "the bulk geometries we construct here seem to provide an interesting interpolation between lorentzian and galilean structures somewhat reminiscent of the galilean limit procedure described in @xcite .",
    "it is also tempting to contemplate the possibility that apart from the context discussed herein , these structures could also provide useful clues on how to work with the gravity duals of non - relativistic field theories . in the context of schrdinger spacetimes which were proposed as duals to non - relativistic conformal field theories @xcite the galilean limit is usually implemented as a dlcq limit which can naturally be studied in the newton - cartan language .",
    "there are many directions in which the constructions we have described here can be generalized . for one",
    "it would be very useful to understand the gravitational dirichlet problem outside of the long wavelength regime and to investigate its well - posedness .",
    "further it would be useful to flesh out in precise detail the connections ( if any ) between the ideas around holographic rg flows and the dirichlet problem and ask whether one can use the ideas developed here to implement the wilsonian holographic flow of @xcite in the non - linear gravity context .",
    "even within the long - wavelength regime there are tantalizing similarities with the blackfold approach @xcite , where one considers hypersurfaces which have intrinsic as well as extrinsic dynamics .",
    "freezing out the extrinsic dynamics should lead one to the gravitational dirichlet problem ( for instance in the analysis of the black string and membrane instabilities @xcite the extrinsic dynamics was frozen and the blackfold equations are precisely those of fluid dynamics ) . while the blackfold analysis is generically well suited for co - dimension three of higher hypersurfaces , it appears that one could recover some of the results discussed herein by extrapolating the equations to a co - dimension one hypersurface .    of more immediate interest",
    "is to complete the derivation of the hypersurface dynamics from that on the boundary to higher orders in the gradient expansion . in particular , while we have shown that the ideal fluid equations on @xmath2 arise from those on the boundary , moving to second order in gradients in the conservation equation will allow us to show at the non - linear level that the shear viscosity of the hypersurface fluid is the same as that on the boundary .",
    "this statement would establish the non - linear version of the non - renormalisation of @xmath135 ( or equivalently @xmath361 since we know that the entropy density being associated with the horizon remains unchanged ) complementing the earlier analysis of @xcite who showed this in the regime of linearized hydrodynamics using a flow equation .",
    "one would hope to also understand by this study why the bulk viscosity term on the hypersurface vanishes despite the fluid being non - conformal and having a non - vanishing trace for the stress tensor . at the same time it would be interesting to understand how the higher order transport coefficients evolve from the boundary to @xmath2 which should be possible to examine within our framework with a little bit of work .",
    "another interesting avenue for exploration is to ask about the gravitational dirichlet problem in the presence of degenerate horizons .",
    "all of the discussion in the present paper and indeed in the fluid / gravity correspondence has focussed on situations of thermal equilibrium at non - zero temperature and hence one naturally studies spacetimes with non - degenerate horizons .",
    "degenerate horizons pose an intriguing challenge and it would be useful to understand how the boundary theory ( which should be more than just a fluid dynamical system ) reorganizes itself as we pass over to the hypersurface description .",
    "it would also be interesting to extend our considerations to stationary black holes where it would be useful to understand the dirichlet dynamics when the hypersurface is inside the ergorsurface ( as defined by the asymptotic observer ) .",
    "finally , another interesting avenue for contemplation is whether the ideas discussed herein can be ported to the context of brane - worlds , where we have gravity induced on a cut - off surface in ads .",
    "recently @xcite attempts to derive the brane gravitational equations by working on a hypersurface near the boundary of ads and invoking the fefferman - graham expansion .",
    "it is clear from our discussion that no matter what boundary condition we choose on the hypersurface , it is most likely to involve non - local deformations on the dual boundary field theory .",
    "what this implies for induced gravity scenarios is an issue that deserves further study .",
