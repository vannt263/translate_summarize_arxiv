    "about 12% ( @xmath0 ) of known planetary systems contain more than one planet .",
    "now that radial - velocity precision at the 1 - 2  level is being achieved by several planet search programs @xcite , neptune - mass planets are becoming detectable .",
    "recent discoveries of `` super - earths '' ( m  sin  @xmath1 10 @xmath2 ) by the high - accuracy radial velocity planet search ( harps ) instrument @xcite suggest that super - earths may be common .",
    "the presence of close - in giant planets ( `` hot jupiters '' ) inferred by precision radial - velocity surveys has emphasized the importance of post - formational dynamical evolution processes such as planetary migration .",
    "the core - accretion model of planetary formation @xcite posits that rocky cores form in the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk and experience runaway gas accretion once they reach a mass of @xmath310 earth masses .",
    "these giant planets then migrate inward to become hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the disk - instability model suggests that such planets form by direct gravitational collapse of the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "multi - planet systems can be formed by this method @xcite , though subsequent evolution can easily eject planets , resulting in a wide variety of system end - states @xcite .",
    "the discovery of additional multi - planet systems will provide valuable added constraints to these two models of planet formation .",
    "@xcite have proposed that gas giant planets migrating inward can overflow their roche lobes and be stripped of their gaseous envelopes . under the core - accretion model of planet formation , a neptune - mass rocky core would then remain in a close orbit , and the detection of such objects would lend support to that theory .",
    "alternatively , the nondetection of close - in , low - mass ( @xmath4 ) planets would tend to favor the disk - instability model , in which gas giant planets have no solid cores .",
    "hence , an intensive effort to characterize the population of detectable planets around nearby stars will be extremely valuable for understanding the processes of planet formation and evolution .",
    "the architectures of multi - planet systems can shed light on their formation and dynamical history .",
    "@xcite performed simulations of systems with three giant planets and found that at least one planet would be ejected before the system stabilised .",
    "when two planets remained ( 80% of cases ) , their median eccentricities were @xmath50.4 .",
    "similarly , randomly generated planetary systems simulated by @xcite typically retained 2 - 3 giant planets after @xmath6  yr .",
    "that all five planets @xcite in the 55  cancri system have relatively low eccentricities ( @xmath7 ) suggests that systems with inactive dynamical histories ( i.e.  free of major perturbation events ) may be able to retain several giant planets in nearly circular orbits .",
    "the final configuration of a planetary system is dependent on the post - formation migration and dynamical interaction processes .",
    "@xcite showed that the migration of a jupiter - mass planet through a disk of planetesimals can result in the formation of an interior terrestrial - mass planet .",
    "simulations of known multi - planet systems by @xcite and @xcite suggest that planetary systems are `` packed ''  that is , they contain the maximum number of planets that is dynamically possible .",
    "@xcite investigated the dynamically stable regions of the hd  74156 system .",
    "those authors used the results to predict that an additional planet , between planets b and c , could be present .",
    "the detection by @xcite of such an object lends support to the `` packed planetary systems '' hypothesis @xcite , which would imply that multiple - planet systems are common . however , our own results ( see   3 ) do not support this hypothesis .",
    "a series of papers by ida & lin @xcite predicts a paucity of planets of 10 - 100 earth masses within @xmath8  au ( the `` planet desert '' ) .",
    "their core - accretion simulations also predict an abundance of close - in ( @xmath90.1  au ) planets with masses below about 10 @xmath2 .",
    "ida and lin further suggest that the distribution of planetary mass vs. semimajor axis will constrain the dominant formation processes of planets . in a subsequent paper , @xcite",
    "show that the frequency of giant planets depends sensitively on the type  i migration rate , which must be slowed by a factor @xmath100.03 - 0.1 in order to reproduce the distribution of detected planets .",
    "in this work , we describe an intensive three - year radial - velocity campaign to search for additional planets in known planetary systems (   2 ) .",
    "section  3 gives the results of the orbit fits and the search for new planets , with discussion about a few of the interesting systems .",
    "section  4 describes the dynamical simulations used to determine the regions in each system where additional planets could reside in stable orbits .",
    "the detection limits , which determine the sensitivity of this survey , are presented in ",
    "5 . finally , section  6 assesses the impact of these new data and analyses on the theories of planet formation and the population - level statistics of extrasolar planets .",
    "this work thus presents a three - fold approach to the question of planetary system architecture : 1 ) are additional planets present in these known planetary systems ?",
    "2 ) where could additional objects reside in stable orbits ?",
    "3 ) what limits can be placed on such objects ?",
    "twenty - two targets were chosen for this project from the list of @xmath3150 planet hosts known in 2004  september .",
    "a majority of the observational data were obtained at mcdonald observatory with the 9.2  m hobby - eberly telescope ( het : ramsey et al .",
    "1998 ) using its high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @xcite .",
    "the targets were selected according to the following criteria : 1 ) het observability , with declination between -11@xmath11  and + 72@xmath11 , and 2 ) either a long - period ( @xmath121 yr ) planet such that inner planets may be dynamically stable , or a very short - period ( @xmath1310 days ) hot jupiter which would allow for previously undetected outer planets , and 3 ) the orbital solution for the known planet in each system has rv residuals of 10 - 20 m s@xmath14 , so that an additional planet may be present but undetected .",
    "the targets and their stellar parameters are listed in table  [ stellarparms ] . except where noted ,",
    "masses are obtained from @xcite , [ fe / h ] , @xmath15 , and v  sin  @xmath1 from @xcite , and the chromospheric emission ratio log @xmath16 @xcite computed from measurements of the ca  ii s - index obtained with the 2.7 m telescope using the techniques developed by @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on the stellar masses given in @xcite are asymmetric about the central value ; for the purposes of table  [ stellarparms ] and the determination of planetary parameters , the adopted stellar mass uncertainty was taken to be the larger of the two .",
    "all of the het observations for this program were performed at a spectral resolution of 60,000 , with the 316 gr / mm cross - disperser and a central wavelength of 5936 .",
    "an iodine cell temperature - controlled at 70  c was used as the velocity metric @xcite .",
    "this setup , identical to that used for the ongoing planet search program @xcite , places the iodine region ( @xmath35000 - 6000  ) almost entirely onto the blue ccd , which is cosmetically superior to the red ccd . for each target",
    ", an iodine - free template spectrum was obtained near the beginning of the first season in which is was observable .",
    "we determined precise radial velocities following the general recipe outlined by @xcite , using an advanced version of our own code `` austral '' @xcite .",
    "we observed each target with the het in queue mode using a random observing interval of 2 - 10 days between visits .",
    "each visit consisted of one spectrum , except for seven bright targets ( hd  3651 , hd  19994 , hd  38529 , hd  74156 , 47  uma , hd  128311 , hd  136118 ) for which 3 consecutive spectra were obtained in each visit .",
    "het data consisting of multiple exposures per visit were binned using the weighted mean value of the velocities in each visit .",
    "we adopted the quadrature sum of the rms about the mean and the mean internal error as the the error bar of each binned point .",
    "this procedure was done for hd  3651 , hd  19994 , hd  38529 , hd  74156 , 47  uma , hd  128311 , and hd  136118 .",
    "targets were observed with the het from 2004  december through 2007  november . during the three years of this study ,",
    "supplemental observations were also made using the 2.7 m harlan j.  smith telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "all available published radial - velocity data were also gathered from the literature for the purpose of fitting orbits to the known planets .",
    "those data are summarized in table  [ rvdata1 ] .",
    "all radial - velocity data obtained from mcdonald observatory are given in tables  [ 3651vels]-[hjs190228 ] .",
    "available published data were combined with velocities from the het and the 2.7 m to fit keplerian orbits using gaussfit @xcite , which is a generalized least - squares program used here to solve a keplerian radial - velocity orbit model .",
    "the gaussfit model has the ability to allow the offsets between data sets to be a free parameter .",
    "this is important because the radial velocities cited in published works , and those computed from het and 2.7 m data , are not absolute radial velocities , but rather are measured relative to the iodine - free stellar template .",
    "the geneva planet - search group , however , makes use of a simultaneous thorium - argon calibration rather than an iodine absorption cell @xcite .",
    "each data set thus has an arbitrary zero - point offset which must be accounted for in the orbit - fitting procedure .",
    "the best - fit keplerian orbital solutions and planetary parameters are shown in table  [ planetparms ] .",

    "were used .",
    "the addition of a large amount of new data and the use of multiple independent data sets in fitting keplerian orbits have generally improved the precision of the derived planetary parameters by a factor of 2 - 4 over the published results summarized in the catalog of nearby exoplanets @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the precision of the orbital periods have been improved by the addition of new data , due to the increased number of orbits now observed .",
    "our parameters generally agree within 2@xmath18 of previously published estimates . in this section ,",
    "we highlight interesting results from the combined fits .    for each object",
    ", we searched for periodic signals in the residuals to the known planet s orbit using a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite . to assess the statistical significance of those periods , the false alarm probabilities ( fap ) were calculated using the bootstrap randomization method detailed by @xcite .",
    "the bootstrap method randomly shuffles the velocity observations while keeping the times of observation fixed .",
    "the periodogram of this shuffled data set is then computed and its highest peak recorded . in this way",
    ", we can determine the probability that a periodogram peak of a given power level will arise by chance , without making any assumptions about the error distribution of the data .",
    "all bootstrap fap estimates result from 10000 such realizations .",
    "those results are shown in table  [ faps ] .",
    "_ hd 20367_. a planet orbiting hd  20367 was first announced in a conference proceedings @xcite , but has not yet appeared in a refereed journal .",
    "the geneva planet search group websiteudry / planet / hd20367.html ] lists the planet s period as 469.5  days , with an eccentricity of 0.32 and m  sin  @xmath1=1.17 .",
    "eighty - one observations of hd  20367 were obtained with the het over three observing seasons , as well as 19 observations from the 2.7 m , but period searches of these data give no indication of such a signal .",
    "figure  [ 20367pgrams ] shows the radial - velocity data from het and the 2.7 m telescopes , and the periodogram of those data .",
    "the geneva group s solution has been overplotted .",
    "the highest peak , at 5.58 days , has a bootstrap fap of 8.5% .",
    "the dominant periodicity of 5.58 days , which was evident early in the observation campaign , prompted a photometric investigation to search for transits and to rule out stellar rotation .",
    "we obtained 132 observations of hd  20367 from 2006 september to 2007 january with the t10 0.8 m automated photometric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "the t10 apt and its precision photometer are very similar to the t8 apt described in @xcite .",
    "the precision of a single observation is typically around 0.001 mag .",
    "the results indicate a stellar rotation period of 5.50@xmath190.02 days , with a photometric amplitude of 0.0055@xmath190.0003 mag ( figure  [ 20367phot ] ) . from these observations",
    ", we conclude that the 5.6-day radial - velocity periodicity is caused by starspots rotating into and out of view .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of @xmath206 days reported by @xcite , and the high level of chromospheric activity for this star ( log @xmath21 ) .",
    "the literature contains conflicting age estimates for hd  20367 : @xcite estimate an age of 4.4@xmath22  gyr , whereas @xcite report an age of 0.9  gyr .",
    "based on the rapid rotation rate , and the high level of chromospheric emission , the younger age estimate is favored .",
    "the lack of any keplerian signal in the 100 observations presented here leads us to conclude that there is not convincing evidence for the existence of hd  20367b .    _",
    "hd 74156_. for hd  74156 , we fit the two planets at 51 and 2473 days using elodie and coralie data from @xcite , and 82 independent het visits .",
    "this system warrants closer scrutiny in light of the report by @xcite of a third planet , with a period of 346  days and a radial - velocity semi - amplitude @xmath23  .",
    "that result was obtained using the same het spectra as considered in this work , but velocities were derived using an independent method described in @xcite . here",
    ", we further investigate the possibility of an additional planet in the hd  74156 system .",
    "applying our orbit - fitting methods as described above to the velocities for hd  74156 given in @xcite , a periodogram peak is evident near 346 days , and we obtain a three - planet keplerian orbit fit which is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the fitting method used here is not responsible for our non - detection of hd  74156d .",
    "it is possible that the het velocities derived by @xcite are of superior quality to those presented here .",
    "however , the rms of the het data about a two - planet fit reported by @xcite is 8.5 , whereas we obtain an rms of 8.3  for those data .",
    "these results suggest that there is no significant difference in quality between the two extant sets of het velocities for hd  74156 .",
    "the uncertainties quoted by @xcite are generally smaller than ours by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "we repeated the fitting procedure , reducing the het uncertainties by a factor of 2 and 3 , but there was no significant change in the residuals : no signal is evident at periods near 346 days .",
    "since the total rms scatter about our two - planet fit is 11.5 , and the semi - amplitude of planet  d is @xmath23 , it is possible that a third planetary signal may have been lost in the noise . to test this possibility , we performed the following monte carlo simulations . from each of the two data sets considered in the fits described here",
    ", we generated 1000 simulated sets of velocities consisting of three keplerian signals plus a gaussian noise term .",
    "this noise was equivalent to the mean uncertainty of each data set ( elodie+coralie : 10.8 , het : 8.3 ) added in quadrature to a stellar jitter of 4  ( the jitter estimate used in bean et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the parameters of the three simulated planets were those from @xcite .",
    "these simulated datasets retained the times of observation and the error bars of the originals .",
    "we then fit the simulated data with a two - planet model exactly as described above , and examined the residuals of the two - planet fit by the periodogram method , to determine whether the signal of planet  d was recovered .",
    "the criteria for recovery were that the period of the second planet had to be detected correctly and with a fap of less than 0.1% .",
    "this fap was computed using the analytic fap formula of @xcite .",
    "of the 1000 trials , only 11 did not result in a successful recovery of the signal of the second planet .",
    "the correct period was recovered 995 times , and the fap exceeded 0.1% only 6 times ; the worst fap was 0.3% .",
    "these results indicate that our method should have been able to detect the signal of hd  74156d , had it been present with the parameters given by @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the iodine - free stellar template spectrum was obtained at a resolving power of @xmath24120,000 , rather than the @xmath2460,000 which is standard for targets in this paper .",
    "we obtained an @xmath24120,000 template spectrum on 2007  nov  12 , but the velocities computed using this template resulted in a 2-planet fit with a slightly higher rms ( het : 8.9 ) than the original @xmath2460,000 template ( het : 8.3 ) .",
    "all analysis for hd  74156 in this paper refers to velocities obtained using the @xmath2460,000 template .",
    "a periodogram of the residuals to our 2-planet fit is shown in the left panel of figure  [ 346phase ] , and those residuals are phased to the 346.6  day period in the right panel .",
    "the window function ( grey dotted line ) has a broad peak near 346 days due to the 1-year observing window .",
    "the phase gaps ( right panel ) are expected since the trial period is close to 1  year .",
    "no clear keplerian signal is evident despite the large number of data points ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we conclude from these data that there is not sufficient evidence for a third planet in the hd  74156 system .    _",
    "47 uma ( = hd  95128)_. in @xcite , we performed these fits to an earlier set of data from mcdonald observatory .",
    "those results did not provide convincing evidence for the outer planet reported by @xcite at p@xmath32594 days ; rather , we obtained a best - fit 2-planet model with @xmath266900 days . here",
    "we include an additional 14 epochs from het , and the best - fit 2-planet model now calls for @xmath279660 days . as in previous attempts to fit a second planet , the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 needed to be held fixed , at the values proposed by @xcite : @xmath30 and @xmath31127@xmath11 .",

    "the data considered in @xcite were of insufficient duration to establish a solution for the outer planet , but the combination of data allows for a keplerian fit to converge .",
    "although a 2-keplerian model can be fit to these data , it is of limited utility : the outer planet has a 50% uncertainty in period ( @xmath33 days ) .",
    "our results support those of @xcite , that a second object is likely present , although there is not yet a sufficient time baseline of observations to establish its nature .",
    "the 1-planet fit was used to derive the parameters given in table  [ planetparms ] , and was also used for the detection - limits determination in   5 .",
    "_ hd 128311_. the inner planet ( @xmath34450 days ) in the hd  128311 system was first discovered by @xcite , who noted a linear trend in the residuals to the fit , as well as the extremely high activity level .",
    "those authors estimated the stellar jitter at 30 , and expressed concern that the planetary signal may have its origin in the stellar velocity jitter .",
    "additional data proved that the inner planet was indeed real , and @xcite reported a second planet at the 2:1 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) .",
    "they published a solution consisting of two superposed keplerian orbits , noting that preliminary dynamical tests showed the system to be unstable , and that the system was likely in a protected 2:1 resonance .",
    "@xcite , in their dynamical analysis of available radial - velocity data , suggested that the observed signal could be attributed to a 1:1 resonance , i.e.  a pair of trojan planets . in this work ,",
    "we fit a double keplerian model to the combined keck and het data .",
    "convergence is achieved , with a total rms of 16.9  about both data sets ( keck15.8 , het17.9 ) .",
    "the residuals show a strong periodicity near 11.5  days , with bootstrap fap less than 0.01% .",
    "photometry of hd  128311 by g.  henry in @xcite indicates a stellar rotation period of 11.53  days with a photometric amplitude of 0.03  mag .",
    "hence , it is quite clear that the residual signal is caused by stellar rotation in this highly active star .    _",
    "hd 130322_. hd  130322 is host to a hot jupiter in a 10.7-day period , discovered with the coralie observations of @xcite .",
    "four data sets are available for this object : coralie @xcite , keck @xcite , het , and 2.7 m .",
    "fitting all four sets together results in a total rms of 14.8 , but removing the coralie data drops the rms to 9.3 .",
    "in addition to the large scatter about the fit , a highly significant periodicity remains at 35 days ( fap@xmath350.01% ) , which vanishes when the coralie data are removed . due to these irregularities ,",
    "we elect to exclude those data from the fits .",
    "the precision of the derived orbital parameters is not significantly affected by this removal , since the coralie data span only 167 days . for all further analysis in this work",
    ", we refer to the fit which excluded the coralie data . as given in table  [ faps ] , a residual period is present at @xmath34438 days ( fap=0.16% ) .",
    "however , the het velocities obtained using a second iodine - free template spectrum show no such periodicity .",
    "those results show a residual period at 2.518 days , with a bootstrap fap of 0.35% .",
    "a second planet can be fitted at this shorter period , and preliminary dynamical tests show that it would remain stable for at least @xmath36  yr ; however , the disagreement between the two templates makes it imprudent for us to claim a detection at this time .",
    "with the increasing availability of computing power and planetary systems , many investigators have undertaken n - body simulations of known planetary systems in an effort to characterise regions in which additional bodies could be found .",
    "@xcite performed a comprehensive test - particle analysis of 85 systems to determine the extent of the habitable zones in the presence of the known planet(s ) . due to disruptions from the known giant planet s `` zone of influence",
    ", '' they found that only one - fourth of the systems had dynamical habitability comparable to our own solar system .",
    "in addition to test particles , massive `` test planets '' have also been used to test observational claims for new planets and to probe known multiple - planet systems for additional regions of stability @xcite .",
    "likewise , in this section we perform test - particle and massive - body simulations on the systems targeted by the intensive radial - velocity monitoring described in   3 .",
    "we performed test particle simulations using swifthal / swift.html . ] @xcite to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low - mass planets in each of the systems considered here .",
    "swift is a numerical integration package which is designed to solve the equations of motion for gravitational interactions between massive bodies ( star , planets ) and massless test particles .",
    "neptune - mass planets can be treated as test particles ( 1 neptune mass = 0.054 ) since the exchange of angular momentum with jovian planets is small .",
    "we chose the regularized mixed - variable symplectic integrator ( rmvs3 ) version of swift for its ability to handle close approaches between massless , non - interacting test particles and planets .",
    "this version is most efficient when the gravitational interactions are dominated by a single body ( the central star ) .",
    "a symplectic integrator has the advantage that errors in energy and angular momentum do not accumulate .",
    "particles are removed if they are ( 1 ) closer than 1 hill radius to the planet , ( 2 ) closer than 0.01  au to the star , or ( 3 ) farther than 10  au from the star . a planetary - mass object passing within 1 hill radius of another planet , or within 0.01",
    "au ( 2 ) of the star s barycenter , is unlikely to survive the encounter .",
    "since the purpose of these simulations is to determine the regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits , we set the outer boundary at 10  au because the current repository of radial - velocity data can not detect objects at such distances .",
    "for each planetary system , 390 test particles were placed in initially circular orbits , spaced every 0.005  au in the region between 0.05 - 2.0  au .",
    "we have chosen to focus on this region because the duration of our high - precision het data is currently 3 - 4 years for the objects in this study .",
    "the test particles were coplanar with the existing planet , which had the effect of confining the simulation to two dimensions .",
    "the initial orbital positions of the particles were randomly distributed in orbital phase with respect to the existing planets .",
    "the method used here are the same as @xcite , in which we performed test - particle simulations for six highly eccentric planetary systems .",
    "input physical parameters ( table  [ planetparms ] ) for the known planet in each system were obtained from our keplerian orbit fits combining published velocity data and new observations from mcdonald observatory .",
    "the planetary masses were taken to be their minimum values ( sin  @xmath37 ) . by choosing the minimum mass for the planets ,",
    "the regions of dynamical stability shown by the test - particle results are larger .",
    "since the system inclinations are almost certainly not edge - on , and hence the true planetary masses are higher , we expect the actual regions of stability to be smaller than shown here .",
    "the systems were integrated for @xmath36 yr , following @xcite and allowing completion of the computations in a reasonable time .",
    "we observed that nearly all of the test - particle removals occurred within the first @xmath38 yr ; after this time , the simulations had essentially stabilized to their final configurations .",
    "the results of the test - particle simulations are shown in figures  [ tp1]-[tp10 ] .",
    "the survival time of the test particles is plotted against their initial semimajor axis .",
    "two systems targeted by the radial - velocity observations were not included in these simulations : hd  20367 , because there is no evidence for a planet , and hd  128311 , since the keplerian orbit solution obtained in ",
    "3.1 results in an unstable system .",
    "as shown in figure  [ tp1 ] , the short - period planet hd  3651b sweeps clean the region inside of about 0.5  au . however , a small number of test particles remained in low - eccentricity orbits near the 1:3 and 2:1 mean - motion resonances ( mmr ) .",
    "since these regions lie within the orbital excursion of hd  3651b , these appear to be protected resonances .",
    "the eccentricity of the test particles in the region of the 1:3 mmr oscillated between 0.00 and 0.31 with a periodicity of about @xmath39  yr , while those in the 2:1 resonance remained at @xmath400.07 throughout the simulation .",
    "all particles beyond about 0.6  au also remained in stable orbits , which is not surprising given the low mass of the planet . in simulations by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a migrating jupiter - mass planet captured planetesimals into low - order resonances , and these accreted into terrestrial planets during the 200  myr run .",
    "the architecture of the hd  3651 system , with a 0.2  planet at 0.3  au , is similar to the configuration modeled by @xcite . given the stable regions evident near the 1:3 and 2:1 resonances for hd  3651b , it is possible that terrestrial - mass planets were captured into these regions during the migration process .",

    "for the two cases in which the test planets exhibited irregular variations in eccentricity , the simulations were continued for @xmath36  yr , anticipating the eventual destruction of the system .",
    "the test planet at 0.45  au in the hd  3651 system caused the ejection of hd  3651b after 1.8@xmath50  yr .",

    "in @xcite , we described a detection - limits algorithm implemented on the sample of constant stars from the long - term planet search at mcdonald observatory .",
    "this approach was based on that used by @xcite to derive detection limits from their survey with the eso coude echelle spectrometer . in brief",
    ", we add a keplerian signal to the existing velocity data , then attempt to recover that signal using a lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the mass of the simulated planet is increased until 99% of the injected signals are recovered with fap@xmath350.1% . for the constant stars in @xcite ,",
    "the null hypothesis is that no planets are present , and so the detection - limit algorithm can be applied directly to the velocity data . in the case of the known planet hosts , this null hypothesis no longer applies , and it would not do to `` pre - whiten '' those data by removing the known planet s orbit as if its parameters were known perfectly .",
    "the presence of an additional planet will act to modify the fitted parameters of the known planet .",
    "if two or more planets are present , and only one has been fitted , then part of the signal from the additional planets can be absorbed into the orbital elements of the 1-planet fit . to approach this task with the maximum rigor",
    ", these effects must be accounted for .",
    "hence , the detection - limit algorithm was modified in the following way : the test keplerian signal was added to each of the _ original data sets _",
    ", then these modified data sets were fitted for the known planet(s ) using gaussfit .",
    "a residuals file was generated and then subjected to the periodogram search as described above .",
    "this process of fitting and removing the known planet occurred for _ every _ injected test signal .",
    "this method has the advantage of being essentially identical to the planet - search method described in   3.1 .",
    "all data used in the fits for each planet host were subjected to the limits - determination routine , using 100 trial periods at even steps in the logarithm between 2 days and the total duration of observations .",
    "the results are plotted in figures  [ limits1]-[limits11 ] ; planets with masses above the lines were recovered in 99% of trials ( solid and dotted lines ) , or 50% of trials ( dashed lines ) , and hence can be ruled out by the data at those confidence levels , respectively . to match the parameter space specifically targeted in this study , and to match that of the test - particle simulations , the detection - limits plots show the inner 2  au only . for the eccentric trials ( solid lines ) ,",
    "the eccentricity of the injected test signals was chosen to be the mean eccentricity of the surviving test particles from the n - body simulations described in   4.2 .",
    "this approach was chosen because the dynamical simulations demonstrated that objects placed in circular orbits do not stay that way ; the eccentricity of an undetected low - mass planet is expected to be influenced to nonzero values by the known giant planet .",
    "it is important to note that the limits presented here represent the companions that can be ruled out by the data with 99% confidence .",
    "lower - mass planets could have been detected in this survey , but not necessarily at all ( or 99% of all ) possible configurations .",
    "it is likely that a particular combination of parameters for a simulated planet makes that signal fiendishly difficult to recover by this method , owing to the known planet s radial - velocity signal and the sampling of the data .",
    "this is particularly important for simulated eccentric planets , where the velocity signal becomes markedly non - sinusoidal .",
    "the 50% limits are also shown to illustrate the effect of relaxing the recovery criteria in order to reduce the impact of especially unfortunate configurations .",
    "table  [ masslimits ] summarizes the results of the detection limits computations .",
    "the mean detection limits shown in table  [ masslimits ] show that we could have detected 99% of planets with m  sin  @xmath521.6 neptune masses at 0.05  au , and m  sin  @xmath522.4 neptune masses at 0.1  au .",
    "the tightest limits were obtained for hd  3651 , hd  108874 , and 47  uma , in which we are able to rule out neptune - mass planets within 0.1  au at the 99% level .",
    "for all of the systems , the limits shown in figures  [ limits1]-[limits11 ] exhibit some `` blind spots '' evident where the periodogram method failed to recover the injected signals with fap@xmath350.1% .",
    "typically this occurs at certain trial periods for which the phase coverage of the observational data is poor , and often at the 1-month and 1-year windows .",
    "using this method of fitting the known planet for each injected trial signal , such regions of ignorance are also present at periods close to that of the existing planet .",
    "the aim of this project has been to intensively monitor known planetary systems in search of additional planets .",
    "however , in the sample of 22 planet hosts , the results have been quite the opposite .",
    "these new data cast doubt on the existence of two of the previously known planets , hd  20367b and 47  uma  c @xcite .",
    "the announcement by @xcite of a third planet in the hd  74156 system , one of the targets of this study , prompted a detailed investigation ; at present we can not confirm this object .",
    "these results suggest that systems with multiple giant planets are considerably more rare , or harder to detect , than anticipated at the outset of this project .    in this section",
    ", we will explore some reasons why no new multiple - planet systems were detected .",
    "four possibilities are : 1 ) biases in the target selection conspire against detection of weak signals , 2 ) there exist fundamental physical differences between single- and multiple - planet systems , 3 ) we did not obtain a sufficient quantity of high - quality data , and 4 ) apparent single - planet systems may contain terrestrial - mass planets below the detection threshold .      as with any scientific experiment , it is important to determine whether the sample selection resulted in unforeseen biases which affected the results . the target - selection process for this study , described in   2 , included an intentional bias in favor of planet hosts with `` large '' ( 10 - 20 ) radial - velocity scatter about the orbital solution .",
    "the reasoning for this choice is straightforward : if a single planet can be fit with minimal scatter , there is little room for additional undetected planets to hide in the residuals .",
    "an unintended consequence of this selection criterion is that the excess scatter may be intrinsic to the star rather than indicative of additional planets .",
    "the achievable velocity precision improves with the number and strength of photospheric lines @xcite .",
    "stars with higher temperatures or lower metallicities would have fewer and weaker lines , and result in lower velocity precision .",
    "in rapidly rotating stars , the spectral lines are broadened , which also degrades the radial - velocity precision .",
    "@xcite showed that the probability of a given star hosting a planet is positively correlated with its metallicity .",
    "in addition , those authors suggested that among planet host stars , metal - rich stars are more likely to host multiple planets . to check for these sorts of biases",
    ", we can perform a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to determine the probability that two samples are drawn from the same distribution . comparing our sample of 22 planet host stars with other planet hosts",
    "not targeted ( @xmath53 ) , the k - s test shows no significant differences in @xmath15 ( @xmath54 ) , [ fe / h ] ( @xmath55 ) , or v  sin  @xmath1 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "a comparison of the mean and median values of these quantities is shown in table  [ stars ] .",
    "the uncertainties are too large to make statistically meaningful comparisons , but the k - s test results suggest that there are no significant differences between the 22 planet hosts targeted here and those planet hosts not chosen .      in this section ,",
    "we ask the question , `` is there something special about the multi - planet systems '' ?",
    "physical differences between single and multiple planet systems could arise either from the host star or from the processes of formation and dynamical evolution .",
    "table  [ stats ] gives statistics on the planetary and stellar parameters for single and multiple - planet systems .",
    "only those planets detected by radial - velocity with m  sin  @xmath5713  were considered in the compilation of these statistics .",
    "table  [ kstest ] shows the results of k - s tests on the planetary and stellar characteristics listed in table  [ stats ] .",
    "none of the parameters tested showed statistically significant differences between single and multiple planet systems .",
    "there are hints from the data in table  [ stats ] , and the k - s test results in table  [ kstest ] that planets in multiple systems have larger @xmath17 and smaller m  sin  @xmath1 than those in single - planet systems",
    ". both of these trends would work against the radial - velocity detection of planets in multiple systems .",
    "as the semimajor axis @xmath17 increases by a factor of @xmath58 , the velocity semiamplitude @xmath59 decreases by @xmath60 , and as the planet mass decreases by a factor of @xmath58 , @xmath59 also drops by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "it is also possible that a tendency toward lower mass and larger semimajor axis in multi - planet systems is the result of a selection effect .",
    "once a single planet is found , follow - up observations may reveal longer - period ( larger @xmath17 ) planets , and intensive monitoring programs such as this work may then find lower - mass planets .",
    "we can test whether a selection effect is at work by computing the statistics in table  [ stats ] for the _ first _ planet discovered in the known multi - planet systems .",
    "these results are also given in table  [ kstest ] ; by comparing only the first planet found in the multiple systems with single planets , any significant difference between the distributions vanishes .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented a detailed investigation of multiple - planet systems , and they find that planets in multiple systems tend to have lower eccentricities than single planets .",
    "we discuss this possibility in   6.5 .",
    "@xcite also note that the orbital distances of planets in multiple systems are more evenly distributed in log - period , whereas single planets are more frequent at @xmath430.05  au and near 1  au .      in considering whether there are important differences between the objects targeted in this work and known multi - planet systems",
    ", we can focus the comparison on the type of planetary system this survey was aimed at finding . the original motivation for this work was to investigate the possibility that systems containing a jovian planet also contain neptune - mass planets ( 1 neptune mass=0.054 ) . at this writing , there are four such systems : 55  cnc , gj  876 , @xmath61  ara ( = hd  160691 ) , and gj  777a ( = hd  190360 ) . with a sample size of only four ,",
    "a meaningful statistical comparison of the host stars is not possible , but one can look at the characteristics of the body of radial - velocity data for these systems . in so doing ,",
    "we ask whether those data are of exceptional quality or quantity which facilitated the detection of the additional low - mass planets in those systems .",
    "the recent detection of a fifth planet in the 55  cnc system by @xcite used 636 measurements , binned into 250 lick visits and 70 keck visits .",
    "the detection of the fourth planet by @xcite used 138 het observations combined with 143 lick data points @xcite and 48 data points from @xcite . for @xmath61  ara",
    ", the neptune - mass planet was discovered using the harps spectrograph , which consistently delivers velocity precision of @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the fourth planet in the @xmath61  ara system @xcite was discovered using a total of 86 harps measurements combined with data from coralie and the aat .",
    "the 18m@xmath62 planet gj  777ac was discovered by @xcite using 87 keck velocities , and @xcite found the 7.5m@xmath62 gj  876d after 155 keck observations .",
    "all four of these systems appear to have required an unusually large amount of the highest - quality data from keck and harps , with a mean of 107 data points .",
    "by contrast , the targets in this work each received an average of 53 het visits .",
    "it is possible that the number of visits required to detect a hot neptune was underestimated .",
    "another possibility is that multiple - planet systems are indeed common , but , like our own solar system , contain many terrestrial - mass objects which are undetectable by current radial - velocity surveys .",
    "core - accretion simulations by @xcite predict a preponderance of 1 - 10m@xmath62 planets inside of 1  au , and a `` planet desert '' in the range of 10 - 100 m@xmath62 , arising due to rapid gas accretion by cores once they reach about 10 m@xmath62 .",
    "the current survey is not sensitive to the terrestrial - mass objects , but planets within the `` desert '' could have been detected .",
    "interestingly , @xcite show that the presence of the planet desert could be confirmed by a radial - velocity survey with 1  precision and @xmath3700 observations , which is similar in scope to the present work .",
    "of course , many more than 22 systems need to be studied before conclusions can be made , but the characterization of hundreds of new systems by the _ kepler _ spacecraft @xcite will help to define the upper and lower mass boundaries of the planet desert .",
    "@xcite note that the lower mass boundary would indicate the core mass required for rapid gas accretion , while the upper mass boundary would give insight into the mechanism by which gas accretion stops .",
    "_ kepler _ discoveries of short - period super - earths with masses 1 - 10m@xmath62 would lend further support to the core - accretion mechanism .    simulations of planetesimal formation and migration also provide support for the existence of terrestrial - mass planets in systems with a gas giant planet .",
    "the gj  876 system @xcite , which contains two giant planets and an interior `` super - earth '' ( m  sin  @xmath1=7.5 m@xmath62 ) , is thought to have originated by the shepherding of material as the giant planets migrated inward @xcite .",
    "200  myr simulations by @xcite and @xcite resulted in the formation of planets with 1 - 5 earth masses interior and exterior to the migrating hot jupiter .",
    "those models included only type  ii migration , in which the migrating giant planet opens a gap in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the models of @xcite consider the effects of type  i migration , in which the giant planet does not open a gap in the disk and inward drift is driven by differential torques on the planet .",
    "inclusion of type  i migration did not alter the general outcome , that planets of several earth masses are shepherded inward by the hot jupiter , and some remain exterior to it .",
    "these models indicate that the inner regions of planetary systems may be populated with terrestrial - mass planets which would remain wholly undetectable by current radial - velocity surveys .",
    "although this work achieved detection limits of 15 - 30 earth masses , rocky planets in the range of 1 - 5 earth masses could easily have been missed .",
    "we now take a step back and look at the bigger picture of planetary system formation and evolution .",
    "based on the target selection and the resulting detection limits , this survey was most sensitive to systems with two giant planets ( larger than saturn mass ) .",
    "more specifically , our `` key demographic '' is a system with a `` cold '' jupiter ( @xmath431  au ) and a close - in planet with m  sin  @xmath631 - 2 neptune masses ( 0.05 - 0.1 ) .",
    "the detection limits given in   5",
    "exclude such configurations at the 99% level for all of the planetary systems considered here .",
    "systems containing a long - period , massive planet could also have been detected by trends or curvature in the velocity residuals ; no such trends were present for any of the targets .",
    "this survey was much less sensitive to planetary systems like our own , with multiple terrestrial - mass planets and long - period giants , for the reasons discussed in   6.4 .",
    "planetary systems with architectures like our own solar system may yet be common , but we will need to wait for the results from _ kepler _ to begin making quantitative statements .",
    "the results of this work are most useful in assessing the frequency of planetary systems in which extensive migration has occurred , to bring two gas giant planets interior to the `` snow line . '' in the core - accretion theory of giant planet formation @xcite , surface - density enhancement by ices facilitates the formation of @xmath310 - 15 m@xmath62 cores .",
    "the snow line , beyond which ices are present in the protoplanetary disk , has been estimated to lie at 1.6 - 1.8  au in a minimum - mass solar nebula @xcite .",
    "perhaps the extensive migration required to construct systems with multiple giant planets with @xmath92  au is uncommon ; the typical timescale in which a system is undergoing migration may be short . in other words , migration may be fast , a hypothesis which has led to theoretical scenarios in which the observed planets are the last of many `` batches '' of planets which migrated onto the host star @xcite .",
    "type  i migration , in which a net viscous torque on the protoplanet changes its orbit @xcite , results in very fast migration with a timescale proportional to @xmath64 . when a planet is massive enough ( 0.3 - 1.0 : armitage  2007 ) to clear a gap in the disk , the slower type  ii migration begins .",
    "the results of this work , showing a deficit of systems with multiple giant planets inside of 2 - 3  au , suggest that they are dominated by type  i migration and rapidly accrete onto the star .",
    "@xcite showed that the type  i migration timescale is inversely proportional to the disk mass : planets in more massive disks migrate faster .",
    "if we make the reasonable assumption that multiple giant planets form from unusually massive disks , then type  i migration works against these planets surviving the migration if they remain below the gap - opening mass . to generate systems with multiple giant planets inside of 2 - 3  au , migration should then be rapid enough to bring them there , but not so fast as to send the planets into the star .",
    "the results presented here suggest that such a scenario is uncommon .",
    "in addition to migration , the dynamical history of planetary systems is an important factor in producing the observed architectures .",
    "the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets suggests that dynamically active histories are common .",
    "interactions between giant planets can result in the ejection of one while imparting a significant eccentricity on the remaining planet @xcite .",
    "systems containing a single giant planet on a moderately eccentric orbit may be the result of such encounters , and thus less likely to host the sort of planets this survey was seeking .",
    "the median eccentricity of the planets targeted in this work is 0.29 , compared to a median @xmath65 of 0.15 for all other planets .",
    "comparing the distributions by the k - s test gives a probability of 0.048 , indicating a marginally significant difference between the two .",
    "@xcite use the relatively low eccentricities ( @xmath7 ) of the five 55  cnc planets to suggest that a benign dynamical history allowed so many planets to remain . the gj  876 , hd  37124 , hd  73526 , and gj",
    "581 systems also have multiple planets with @xmath7 , but counterexamples are found in hd  160691 , hd  74156 , and hd  202206 ( @xmath66=0.57 , 0.64 , and 0.44 , respectively ) .",
    "an uneventful dynamical history contributes to a planetary system s observed end state , but comprises only a part of the picture in combination with its formation history .",
    "a primary goal of the search for extrasolar planets is to estimate how common the architecture of our own solar system might be .",
    "if the processes of planet formation and migration form many systems similar to our own , it becomes more likely that earth - like planets may be present . the results of this work indicate that planetary systems like our own may be common if 1 ) terrestrial - mass planets are present but undetected , or 2 ) type  i migration timescales are so short that multiple giant planets rarely end up within 2 - 3  au .",
    "conversely , our solar system may be rare if the dynamical history of most planetary systems results in many ejections and high eccentricities .",
    "we have carried out an intensive radial - velocity campaign to monitor 22 known planetary systems for additional planets .",
    "no new planets were found , and these new data do not support the proposed planets hd  20367b , hd  74156d , and 47  uma  c. we have used test particles and saturn - mass bodies to probe 20 planetary systems for regions in which additional planets could exist .",
    "the massive - body results are consistent with the test - particle results : each of these systems has regions , sometimes quite large , where additional planets may remain in stable orbits .",
