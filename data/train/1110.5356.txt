    "radiatively inefficient accretion onto black holes can occur in the limits of both low and high accretion rates . although black holes can hypothetically absorb the gravitational energy liberated during accretion ( begelman 1979 ) , in the realistic case of a rotating accretion flow the accretion tends to be strongly inhibited , with much less gas reaching the black hole than is supplied at large distances .",
    "the reason for this is that the outward transport of angular momentum also involves the transport of energy , which causes the gas far from the black hole to become unbound ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "there is ample observational evidence that black holes can be  fussy eaters . \"",
    "the galactic center black hole appears to be accreting at a rate orders of magnitude below the bondi rate ( melia & falcke 2001 , and references therein ) , as are the black holes in some elliptical galaxies with weak x - ray sources ( di matteo et al .",
    "2000 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; baganoff et al .",
    "these systems are believed to be radiatively inefficient because their densities are low enough to inhibit cooling . at the other extreme",
    ", cooling is suppressed in hypercritical ( super - eddington ) accretion flows because radiation is trapped by the large optical depth .",
    "hyperaccreting sources such as the galactic binary ss433 ( king , taam & begelman 2000 ; begelman , king & pringle 2006 ) , galactic microquasars during outburst ( mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) , and possibly ultraluminous x - ray sources ( king 2008 ; gladstone , roberts & done 2009 ) all appear to produce powerful outflows",
    ". numerical simulations of nonradiative accretion onto black holes also show this inhibition , either through the development of a zonal structure with inflowing gas near the rotational equator , sandwiched between outflowing zones at high latitudes , or through convective motions internal to the flow ( e.g. , stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; igumenschev & abramowicz 1999 , 2000 ; stone & pringle 2001 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ; mckinney & gammie 2002 ; igumenshchev , narayan & abramowicz 2003 ; de villiers , hawley & krolik 2003 ; yuan & bu 2010 ) .",
    "blandford & begelman ( 1999 , 2004 ; hereafter bb99 and bb04 ) proposed a simple model for radiatively inefficient accretion flows , dubbed the ",
    "adiabatic inflow - outflow solution \" ( adios ) . in their steady state ,",
    "self - similar formulation , there are inflowing and outflowing zones with equal and opposite mass fluxes that vary with radius according to @xmath0 with @xmath5 . in addition , there is presumably a small constant mass flux that reaches the black hole and is accreted  but this need not be modeled in detail . in the one - dimensional , one - zone models developed in bb99 ( and presented using a different parameterization in bb04 ) , the vertically averaged conservation laws and dynamical constraints  applied only to the inflowing zone  impose well - defined relationships among the parameters describing the model , such as the specific angular momentum of the gas , its effective binding energy ( characterized by the bernoulli function ) , and the mass flux index @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath4 is not determined by these relations , but can take on any value between 0 and 1 .",
    "in addition to analyzing some of the two - dimensional characteristics of the inflow zone ( and showing that the 1d models provide an excellent first approximation ) , bb04 considered the outflow zone in some detail .",
    "in particular , they showed that outflowing streamlines can be self - consistently patched onto the inflow zone at each radius . by assuming that the streamlines are adiabatic , laminar , and inviscid , they produced a family of self - similar wind models to represent the outflow zone .",
    "while the bb04 models provide a  proof of concept \" for adios , they do not necessarily provide an accurate depiction of even the qualitative features of a realistic zonal flow .",
    "in particular , the assumption of a wind with adiabatic , inviscid streamlines leads to very different kinds of flows in the inflow and outflow zones .",
    "while the inflow models depict a highly turbulent , well - mixed flow , the outflow models consist of a well - ordered flow pattern , with streamlines at higher latitudes reflecting conditions much closer to the black hole than streamlines close to top of the inflow zone .",
    "for example , since the terminal velocity along each streamline scales with the escape speed at its footpoint , the outflow models of bb04 exhibit large shears in the vertical direction , with the speed approaching  infinity \" near the evacuated cone that defines the wind s centrifugal barrier ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "6 of bb04 ) .",
    "numerical simulations that show the generic characteristics of an adios ( e.g. , stone et al .  1999 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ) often seem to exhibit much messier outflows than the bb04 models .",
    "the outflow region appears to be as chaotic as the inflow , with the typical speeds at each radius reflecting the local keplerian velocity .",
    "moreover , in adiabatic simulations one does not see a range of values for @xmath4 , but rather ( where this is measurable ) a tendency for the effective value of @xmath4 to be close to 1 .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new formulation of adios in which the inflow and outflow zones are treated on an equal footing . given the success of the 1d inflow model as demonstrated in bb04 , we adopt a one - dimensional model for each zone and mainly consider self - similar flow .",
    "we show that the introduction of a relatively simple two - zone model has a dramatic effect on the character of the solutions : instead of obtaining solutions for any value of @xmath4 in the range @xmath6 , we find that non - radiative solutions must have @xmath1 .",
    "such flows are regulated by a conserved , outward flux of energy through the flow  ignored in the bb99 and bb04 models  and in fact require the presence of such a flux for self - consistency .",
    "the source of this flux must be the energy liberated by the residual accretion onto the black hole .",
    "the inflows associated with these solutions can range from marginally bound to nearly keplerian , depending on how large the net energy flux is and how it is partitioned between the inflow and outflow zones .",
    "outflow solutions come in two varieties : powerful winds with speeds of order the keplerian speed and gentle , subsonic",
    " breezes \" driven by viscous stresses .    flows with self - similar radiative losses have mass flux indices @xmath7 that depend on the rate of energy loss .",
    "these flows also depend on the existence of a central energy flux , but the net flux in this case is gradually eroded by radiative losses . taking the limit as the radiative loss rate goes to zero , we find that these solutions also approach @xmath1 .",
    "the inflows in these cases are always relatively tightly bound .    finally , we present two - zone adios models for hyperaccretion , i.e. , super - eddington accretion , in which the radiative losses are tied closely to the geometrical and dynamical structure of the flow .",
    "the special form of the energy loss rate destroys self - similarity on large scales , but at sufficiently small radii we can model the radiative effects as small corrections to nonradiative flows . by extrapolating these effects to scales where they become nonlinear",
    ", we develop an approximate picture for the flow patterns , luminosities and accretion rates of hyperaccreting systems .",
    "we suggest that there may be two modes of hyperaccretion , corresponding to the wind and breeze solutions mentioned above .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the one - zone adios model of bb99 and bb04 , introduce the equations for the two - zone model , and show that two - zone models without a net energy flux are not self - consistent . in section 3 ,",
    "we explore the parameter space for perfectly non - radiative two - zone models and in section 4 we consider the effects of ( self - similar ) radiative losses . in section 5",
    "we examine the constraints associated with dissipative heating .",
    "we present our model for hyperaccretion in section 6 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and summarize our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "we first review the ",
    "one - zone \" adios model proposed by bb99 and bb04 , referring readers to section 2.1 of bb04 for further details . adopting the conventions",
    "that the local accretion rate @xmath8 and outward viscous couple @xmath9 are positive ( where @xmath10 is used in bb04 to represent the viscous couple per unit mass ) , we obtain the following equations expressing the conservation of mass , angular momentum and energy in a steady state : [ angmom1 ] ddr(g - m l ) = - ( 1 + ) l dmdr [ energy1 ] ddr(g - m b ) = ( -1 ) b dmdr , where @xmath11 is the specific angular momentum , @xmath12 is the angular speed , and [ bernouilli ] b = l^22r^2 - 1r + h is the bernoulli function when @xmath13 ( where we use a roman typeface for the gravitational constant to avoid confusion with the viscous couple ) and @xmath14 is the specific enthalpy ( @xmath15 for an ideal gas with adiabatic index @xmath16 ) .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of equations ( [ angmom1 ] ) and ( [ energy1 ] ) represent the rates at which angular momentum and energy are lost to the outflow , per unit radius . for power - law solutions with @xmath0 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ,",
    "these forms for the angular momentum and energy loss are fully general with the appropriate choice of the constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to the conservation laws , the inflow is subject to a dynamical equilibrium condition based on the radial component of the momentum equation .",
    "given the self - similar scalings for pressure and density , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( bb99 ) , and assuming that the inflow is very subsonic , we obtain @xmath23 eliminating @xmath24 in favor of @xmath25 , one finally obtains a three - parameter family of adios models .",
    "the independent parameters may be taken to be @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , or @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , or any combination of these .",
    "bb04 show that solutions can be found for any value of @xmath4 in the interval @xmath5 . in this interval ,",
    "the constants of integration for the conservation equations may be neglected and one obtains simple relations among the various quantities . in particular , one can show that the bernoulli function satisfies [ bg ] b = glm r^2 1-n 1 - n . since all quantities on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) are positive with the possible exception of @xmath29 , we must have @xmath30 in order for @xmath25 to be negative and the inflow to be bound .",
    "but one can also show that @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "the sign of @xmath25 therefore appears to be undefined in this limit .",
    "indeed , if one integrates the energy conservation equation in the limit @xmath32 , one finds that the left - hand side must integrate to a constant , whereas the right - hand side diverges logarithmically if @xmath33 .",
    "we conclude that the constant of integration  which physically represents a conserved radial energy flux through the disk  can not be neglected in this limit .",
    "let us now generalize the one - dimensional adios formulation to include the outflow as well as the inflow . in bb04 ,",
    "the outflow was treated in a fundamentally different way from the inflow . by patching an adiabatic ,",
    "inviscid streamline onto the inflow at every radius , bb04 showed how the outflowing gas could carry away the required amounts of angular momentum and energy .",
    "however , the resulting flow patterns exhibit enormous shear in the poloidal ( @xmath34 ) direction and large angular gradients of temperature and density . this is because each streamline reflects the conditions prevailing at the radius where it was launched : streamlines launched near a given radius will lie close to the inflow - outflow boundary and have speeds close to the escape speed at that radius , whereas streamlines closer to the axis will have come from smaller radii and have correspondingly larger speeds and higher specific entropies",
    ".    simulations , however , suggest that this view of independent , inviscid streamlines may not be accurate .",
    "they suggest that the outflow is as chaotic as the inflow and is much better described as being ",
    "well - mixed . \"",
    "this suggests that it might be better to treat the mean properties of the outflow at each radius , rather than trying to keep the properties of the individual streamlines separate . in this spirit",
    ", we treat the outflow using the same parametrization as the inflow . denoting the inflowing ( outflowing ) zones by subscripts 1 ( 2 ) , and keeping the sign conventions from section 2.1 ( and bb99 , bb04 ) we write down a set of coupled conservation equations : [ angmom2 ] ddr(g_1 - m_1 l_1 ) = - g_12 , [ angmom3 ] ddr(g_2 + m_2 l_2 ) = g_12 , [ energy2 ] ddr(g_1 _ 1 - m_1 b_1 ) = - q_12 - _ 1 , [ energy3 ] ddr(g_2 _ 2 + m_2 b_2 ) = q_12 - _ 2 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the fluxes of angular momentum and energy per unit radius , respectively , transferred from zone 1 to zone 2 , and",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 represent net radiative losses from each zone . by mass conservation",
    ", the mass fluxes in zones 1 and 2 must be related according to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant representing the flux of gas that reaches the central object .",
    "we can therefore drop the subscript on @xmath41 and write @xmath42 .",
    "the angular momentum and energy fluxes transferred between zones cancel when the pairs of conservation equations are summed .",
    "we can integrate the summed pairs of equations , to obtain [ fl ] m ( l_1 - l_2)= g_1 + g_2 + f_l - m_0 l_1 , [ fe ] m ( b_1 - b_2)= g_1 _ 1 + g_2 _ 2 - f_e + ^r_r_0 ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) dr - m_0 b_1 , where the constants of integration @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent outward fluxes of angular momentum and energy , respectively , and we assume that the viscous stresses vanish at the innermost radius @xmath45 . since we are interested in radii far outside the inner boundary , where @xmath46 , we can neglect the terms containing @xmath40 in both equations . since @xmath47 is an increasing function of @xmath48 , we can neglect @xmath49 as well . since the viscous stress is assumed to be directed outward , eq .",
    "( [ fl ] ) then implies that @xmath50 , i.e. , that the inflow is spinning more rapidly than the outflow at each radius .    in the one - zone adios model , bb99 and bb04",
    "neglected @xmath44 as well , which is justifiable for self - similar solutions with @xmath7 .",
    "in the two - zone case , however , this assumption yields the curious result that @xmath51 , i.e. , that the inflowing gas is _ less _ bound than the outflowing gas . since the motivation for considering adios models is the tendency of accreting gas to become unbound if it has no way to give up energy or angular momentum , this result seems suspect .",
    "indeed , we shall show below that it is also incompatible with the condition of dynamical equilibrium .      to assess the self - consistency of the two - zone models , we introduce a generalized version of the dynamical equilibrium condition .",
    "we need to include inertial forces in the outflow zone , where the speed ( @xmath52 ) may be close to sonic .",
    "we continue to assume that the inflows are driven by viscous stresses at ( presumably ) very subsonic speeds .",
    "when mass is being transferred from the inflowing zone to the outflowing zone , the introduction of slowly moving gas emulates a drag force in the outflow region . for a power - law model with @xmath0 ,",
    "the resulting deceleration is given roughly by [ inertial ] - v_2 2r _ 2 mr = -n v_2 ^ 2r , where we ignored the speed of the inflowing gas .",
    "the radial momentum equation for zone 2 then takes the form @xmath53 where we have defined an isothermal sound speed @xmath54 .",
    "the radial momentum equation for zone 1 takes the form @xmath55 similar except for the neglect of dynamical terms . as in bb04",
    ", we ignore the angular correction terms associated with the finite scale height of each zone , effectively assuming that each zone is geometrically thin .",
    "this will lead to errors of order @xmath56 , where @xmath14 is the scale height . by comparing the one - dimensional models to two - dimensional ( gyrentropic ) models",
    ", bb04 showed that the 1d models provide an excellent approximation , at least for the inflow zones .",
    "since the outflow zones sandwich the inflow , we are also implicitly assuming that the @xmath57 is substantially larger than @xmath58 .",
    "as in the one - zone models , we can eliminate one of the variables in each zone in favor of the bernoulli function .",
    "we modify the bernoulli function for zone 2 to include the radial kinetic energy : [ ber2 ] b_2 = v_2 ^ 2 2 + l_2 ^ 22 r^2 - 1r + -1 a_2 ^ 2 , with a similar expression ( absent the dynamical term ) for zone 1 .",
    "if we subtract eq .",
    "( [ mom2 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ mom1 ] ) and eliminate @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath60 since the coefficient multiplying @xmath61 is always negative , eq .",
    "( [ delb1 ] ) shows that @xmath62 and @xmath63 must have _ opposite _ signs if dynamical terms are negligible .",
    "this contradicts the conservation laws , equations ( [ fl ] ) and ( [ fe ] ) , which demand that these quantities have the same sign in the zero - flux ( @xmath64 ) limit .    in order to change the sign of @xmath62 , the term proportional to @xmath65 must be sufficiently positive and large .",
    "a necessary condition is [ nlimit ] n < 5 - 32 ( + 1 ) , which restricts @xmath4 to values between 0 ( for @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 ( for @xmath68 ) . to check whether consistency is possible",
    "even for such low values of @xmath4 , we use the momentum equation to eliminate @xmath65 in favor of @xmath59 .",
    "we obtain @xmath69 since @xmath70 , the coefficient of @xmath61 is still negative , implying that the other term must be positive .",
    "but in the coefficient of @xmath59 both the numerator and denominator are positive , implying that @xmath71 .",
    "this would mean that the outflow must be  colder \" than the inflow , which seems unlikely given that it lies on top of the inflow , is in vertical pressure balance with it , and must have a higher specific entropy since it consists of adiabatic gas that has already passed through the inflow and has suffered dissipative heating in the process .",
    "thus , it appears that the constraints of _ dynamical _ equilibrium in a two - zone adios are incompatible with the constraints of energy and angular momentum conservation , if the net energy flux passing through the system is negligible .",
    "this bolsters our original argument , based on the implausibility of @xmath62 being positive on energetic grounds .",
    "how is this paradox resolved ?",
    "the only reasonable conclusion seems to be that @xmath72 and that a two - zone adios model requires a substantial flux of energy passing through the system from small radii .",
    "if radiative losses are negligible , this flux is conserved .",
    "but in the presence of radiative losses , this flux must be large enough to both change the sign of @xmath62 at small radii and compensate for the integrated radiative losses further out . in the limit of negligible radiative losses",
    ", this implies that @xmath73 is independent of radius and @xmath4 is not a free parameter , but must instead be @xmath74 .",
    "we first consider the case in which radiative losses can be neglected , and therefore set @xmath75 . compared to the one - zone adios model ( bb04 )",
    ", the two - zone model would appear to be more restrictive since @xmath1 and @xmath76 .",
    "however , two - zone adios models still form a three - parameter family because the energy flux @xmath44 is split into a portion that travels through the inflow and a portion that travels through the outflow . defining [ g12 ] g_12 = ( 1 + ) l_1 d m d r",
    ", we can take @xmath19 to be a third parameter representing the  lever arm \" associated with angular momentum transfer , with a permissible range @xmath77 . on physical grounds ,",
    "we expect values of @xmath78 to apply if organized magnetic fields mediate the transfer of angular momentum ( bb04 )",
    ".    denote the dimensionless energy flux by [ mudef ] ( where we recall that @xmath79 ) and let @xmath80 be the fraction of the flux that propagates through the outflow .",
    "if we define the dimensionless variables [ dimensionless ] g ; = r^3/2 ; br b , with subscripts 1 or 2 as appropriate , then the integrated conservation equations ( [ angmom2])([energy3 ] ) become @xmath81 we therefore have four conservation equations relating the 6 dimensionless variables @xmath82 , and @xmath83 note that @xmath8 is not an independent variable , since solutions are invariant under transformations that keep @xmath84 and @xmath85 fixed .",
    "in addition , we have two dynamical equilibrium conditions , which we can cast in terms of the bernoulli function by eliminating the sound speed @xmath86 and introducing a dimensionless radial speed @xmath87 : @xmath88 \\\\ \\label{dimlesseqn2 } b_2 & = & { 3 - \\gamma \\over 3 ( \\gamma -1 ) } \\left [ 1 - { 3 + \\gamma \\over 2 ( 3 - \\gamma ) } \\ell_2 ^ 2 \\right ] + { 5\\gamma - 3 \\over 6 ( \\gamma - 1 ) } u_2 ^ 2 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we thus have 6 equations for the 7 variables ( including @xmath89 ) , which formally define a line through the @xmath90 parameter space",
    ". however , we can make the assumption that the viscous stress , in either zone , is capable of driving only very subsonic radial velocities .",
    "therefore , if @xmath91 is non - negligible , then @xmath89 is negligible ; conversely , a dynamically significant outflow speed implies that @xmath92 , for our purposes .",

    "if the actual accretion efficiency is @xmath257 , so that the energy flux is @xmath258 , then the accretion rate is [ mdotzero ] m_0 = 1- .",
    "a larger value of @xmath106 merely means that equality between @xmath173 and @xmath259 const",
    ".  occurs farther from the black hole . in this case",
    ", there would be a wide radial zone in which @xmath40 dominates the mass flow .",
    "such a region would resemble a unidirectional accretion flow ( similar to the early advection - dominated accretion flow [ adaf ] models of narayan & yu [ 1994 , 1995 ] ) , rather than an inflow - outflow system , and would therefore develop a positive bernoulli function ( bb99 ) .",
    "for this reason , we expect that two - zone adios models are restricted to values of @xmath260 or 3 .",
    "because our model is self - similar , we can not treat boundary conditions in detail .",
    "however , we suspect that the value of @xmath106 ( and therefore the accretion rate into the black hole ) and possibly the value of @xmath80 can adjust in response to the energetic demands of the system .",
    "a couple of our results suggest this .",
    "first , when weak radiative losses are introduced into the model in a self - similar way , the mass flux index @xmath4 drops below 1 by an amount that depends on the fractional energy loss per decade of radius .",
    "the effect of this is that @xmath40 determines the energy flux through the flow at small radii , but that the flow gradually  forgets \" about the inner boundary with increasing @xmath48 , i.e. , as the centrally injected energy is radiated away .",
    "the case of hypercritical accretion provides a more dramatic example , since solutions with a large ratio of outer - to - inner radius must have @xmath261 .",
    "apparently , matter supplied to a black hole at a highly super - eddington rate will also be accreted at a highly super - eddington rate , in order to supply enough energy to match radiative losses in addition to powering the flow .",
    "nevertheless , both @xmath106 and @xmath80 must fall into fairly narrow ranges in order for the flows to be self - consistent .",
    "( the parameter @xmath20 , which describes energy transfer from inflow to outflow , must also self - regulate to @xmath74 for @xmath1 ) .    despite the highly constrained parameter space",
    ", our solutions display a striking range of behaviors from gentle breezes , governed by viscous stress , to transsonic winds .",
    "such bimodal behavior extends to hypercritical accretion , where the dependence of radiative losses on flow geometry and dynamics breaks self - similarity close to the trapping radius .",
    "we note that shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) foresaw the possibility of both powerful winds and gentle outflows in their pioneering discussion of hypercritical accretion .    both breezes and winds",
    "are unbound , in the sense that the bernoulli function is positive , but any significant radiative losses near the outer radii of the adios could quench the weaker outflows .",
    "it is possible that breeze solutions represent large - scale circulations rather than genuine mass loss , in which case the total mass of the system would grow with time if matter continues to be introduced from outside .",
    "the strength of the adios approach is that it relies on simple conservation laws and dynamical equilibrium conditions , which impose clear constraints on the space of possible flows .",
    "thus it can provide a useful framework against which numerical models or observations can be analyzed . beyond the application of conservation laws and dynamical relations , the adios idea relies on the assumption that some physical mechanism exists to bifurcate the available energy and to launch an outflow that is spatially distinct from the inflowing gas . in the case of the two - zone models presented here",
    ", it also assumes that the inflow and outflow zones are both well - mixed .",
    "these assumptions may not be valid , or may apply only in certain types of systems ( e.g. , depending on boundary conditions , magnetic field structures [ see , e.g. , beckwith , hawley & krolik 2008 , 2009 ] , or the relative importance of magnetic and radiative stresses ) .",
    "but the two - zone conservation laws and dynamical relations are very general and can be adapted to treat alternative assumptions about the flow pattern . for example , one can devise a two - fluid model that might capture the physics of a radiatively inefficient flow dominated by nonlinear convection , with the inflow and outflow zones interpenetrating one another .",
    "such a model could represent a  convection - dominated accretion flow \" ( cdaf : narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "we will present such a model , and compare its properties to those of the two - zone adios model , in a forthcoming paper .",
