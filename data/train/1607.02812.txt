    "[ introduction ]    heavy - light mesons composed of one heavy quark and one light quark act as the hydrogen atoms of hadron physics and are the ideal laboratory for the understanding of strong interactions in the non - perturbative regime@xcite . in the past several years",
    ", significant progress has been achieved in studying the charmed and charmed - strange states exerimentally@xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the ground charmed and charmed - strange mesons such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 have been established@xcite , and some candidates for higher radial and orbital excitations have also been reported , which have stimulated many theoretical investigations on these excitations@xcite .",

    "unlike the prosperity of charm sector , experimental information on excited bottom and bottom - strange mesons is scarce .",

    "some theoretical predictions on masses and widths of bottom and bottom - strange mesons have been performed in different approaches such as constituent quark model@xcite , chiral quark model@xcite , @xmath25 model@xcite , heavy meson effective theory@xcite and other approaches@xcite .",
