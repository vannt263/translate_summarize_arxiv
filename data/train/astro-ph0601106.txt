    "starting with the three level 1 event lists that make up this unusual dataset ( see table 1 in paper i ) , we performed several custom data processing steps to filter and improve the individual event lists , as described in paper i. source detection was then performed on the merged data using _ wavdetect _ @xcite with a threshold of @xmath18 due to the presence of diffuse emission @xcite .",

    "the acis data suffer from source confusion in this region .",
    "since this cluster was placed at the aimpoint of the acis - i array , r136 sources have sharply - peaked , sub - arcsecond point spread functions ( psfs ) , so our knowledge of the x - ray emission of those sources might benefit from super - resolution techniques . pursuant to this idea , we applied acis sub - pixel resolution software to the photon events @xcite , formed several high - resolution images of the r136 region from those events , reconstructed those images using a simple maximum likelihood algorithm ( described below ) , and used the reconstructions to identify additional x - ray point sources in r136 .",

    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations are better - suited to the analysis of these sources .      to elucidate the source population in r136 and in the subgroup r140 @xcite , we performed maximum likelihood image reconstructions on these fields using the idl routine _ max_liklihood.pro _ in the idl astronomy user s library maintained by wayne landsman .",

    "psf varies substantially with off - axis angle , we chose to reconstruct the neighborhoods around two sources in r136 separated by @xmath24 in order to cover the entire region suffering from source confusion using appropriate psfs .",
    "our goal was to supplement the candidate list of point sources in very crowded parts of the field , where both _",
    "wavdetect _ and visual examination fail to provide a good census of sources .    while the r140 reconstruction did not reveal any new point sources in that cluster , the r136 reconstruction separated the unresolved emission in this region into many peaks , hinting that many more x - ray point sources were present in this region than the @xmath25 that _ wavdetect _ revealed ( see  [ sec : ptsrcs ] ) .",
    "we quantified peaks in the reconstructed image using the idl astronomy user s library routine _ find.pro_ , an idl version of the _ find _ routine in peter stetson s daophot package @xcite .",
    "this routine gives the centroid position of each peak and a measure of its shape and brightness .",
    "peaks that were clearly associated with single events in the data were filtered out using these shape and brightness criteria . then using _",
    "saoimage ds9 _ , we overlaid apertures representing the 90% on - axis psf contour onto an image of the acis data , placed at the locations of reconstruction peaks . only those peaks that contained at least two acis events within the 90% aperture",
    "were kept for further consideration .",
    "this list of potential sources from maximum likelihood reconstruction was merged with that from _ wavdetect _ , yielding 288 candidate sources on the acis - i array .",
    "we then performed a preliminary event extraction for these candidate sources using _ acis extract _ , which includes a calculation of the probability that the events contained in a given extraction region are due solely to poisson variations in the local background ( a quantity that we will later call @xmath26 in tables  [ tbl : sourcelist ] and [ tbl : tentative ] ) .",
    "note that we did not allow reconstruction peaks that were generated from single isolated x - ray events to be considered x - ray point sources , regardless of their statistical likelihood , due to the presence of diffuse emission in the region .",
    "this probability provides an objective estimate of source validity ; at this stage of the analysis , we required that each candidate source have no more than a 1% likelihood of being a background fluctuation in order to be considered valid .",
    "this resulted in a final list of 180 acceptable potential sources often can not be judged without consideration of the full catalog of sources .",
    "the validity of @xmath27 depends on the local background estimate for @xmath27 which must obviously exclude regions thought to contain other point sources .",
    "thus members of the catalog must be chosen before their final source validity is calculated , and source validity estimates are an obvious way to judge membership in the catalog .",
    "we have not attempted to define a source identification and local background estimation process that results in a completely unique solution .",
    "the initial set of 288 potential sources was extracted and then cut at the threshold of 1% likelihood of being a background fluctuation .",
    "this trimmed list of 180 potential sources was then re - extracted , resulting in different local background estimates and different source validity metrics @xmath26 .",
    "thus some @xmath26 values in table  [ tbl : tentative ] are @xmath14 1% ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "] , ranging in brightness from 1.3 to 6187 net counts .",
    "since this source validity test relies on local background estimates , extremely faint sources can be reliably detected in regions of very low background ; such conditions exist in the r136 core . given the extraordinarily high source density in r136 , though , even the reconstructed sources may actually be source blends .",
    "local background estimates , hence @xmath26 used in an absolute sense , are subject to substantial uncertainty in our sparse datasets . in 30  dor",
    "this is complicated by the extensive , highly - structured diffuse emission in the field ; to get a reasonable number ( @xmath29 ) of background counts one must travel far ( @xmath30 for our on - axis sources ) from the source , making the background estimate not as `` local '' as one might wish .",
    "we use @xmath26 as a way to make reasonable distinctions between our primary sourcelist ( table  [ tbl : sourcelist ] , in which we have substantial confidence ) , our tentative sourcelist ( table  [ tbl : tentative ] , containing sources still quite likely to be real ) , and failed candidate sources .    to test the stability of the primary sourcelist definition criterion ( @xmath31 ) to changes in the local background , we deleted the 33 sources in table  [ tbl : tentative ] with @xmath32 ( leaving 30 tentative sources ) and re - extracted the remaining 147 sources , re - calculating @xmath26 for each source .",
    "most of the deleted sources were in r136 ; when they were removed from the input sourcelist , _ acis extract _ treated their photons as background .",
    "we wanted to test whether this added background substantially altered the detection significance of the remaining r136 sources , as a way to test the fidelity of using image reconstruction to nominate sources for the _ acis extract _ process .",
    "after this second extraction , 32 of the 147 sources had @xmath33 and would be considered tentative ; of those 32 , 15 had @xmath32 . a few sources with @xmath26 near the cut - off value of 0.003 changed tables : four primary sources ( acis # 33 , 94 , 106 , and 116 ) moved to the tentative table and two tentative sources ( acis # 97 and 123 ) moved to the primary table .",
    "all other primary sources continued to have @xmath31 ; this demonstrates that our method of selecting high - quality point sources using _ acis extract _ is stable to changes in the tentative sourcelist and local background .",
    "thus we retained the original 180 potential x - ray point sources for further analysis , divided into primary and tentative sourcelists based on @xmath26 from the first extraction .",
    "obviously , users of these data should view tentative sources with appropriate caution based on the value of @xmath26 for each source .      with the caveats of the last section in mind",
    ", we extracted a final set of source characteristics for our trimmed list of 180 sources .",
    "positions for the sources derived from reconstructions were unaltered ; positions for _ wavdetect _ sources were recomputed during the preliminary extractions .",
    "isolated sources were assigned extraction regions corresponding to the 90% contours of their psfs .",
    "crowded sources were assigned extraction regions corresponding to smaller ( down to 40% ) psf fractions to ensure that virtually no photons were included in more than one source .",
    "note however that properties of crowded sources may still be affected by the psf wings of their neighbors .",
    "source spectra , arfs , and rmfs were constructed by _ acis extract _ , which uses standard ciao tools .",
    "spatial masking was applied to the event data and exposure map in order to eliminate most point source light prior to extraction of local background spectra for each extracted source .",
    "such masking and background computations necessarily involve a tradeoff between the competing goals of eliminating all the light from the point sources and making the background spectra as `` local '' as possible .",
    "we chose a relatively sophisticated iterative approach which seeks to mask all regions where the expected surface brightness from the point sources is larger than one half the observed background level .",
    "an expected surface brightness image is computed using the exposure map and source flux estimates from preliminary extractions .",
    "a smooth background image is iteratively computed by smoothing the masked event data and exposure map .",
    "the resulting mask always covers all the source extraction regions , and extends beyond them for bright sources .",
    "local background spectra for each source were extracted from the masked event data and exposure map by searching for a circular aperture centered on the source that contained at least 100 counts and included an unmasked area at least 4 times that of the source region .",
    "the background spectra were scaled appropriately using the masked exposure map pixels found in the background and source regions .",
    "typically the scaled full - band background level in on - axis spectra is @xmath34 count .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate rigorously the reliability of this sourcelist .",
    "since this region may contain diffuse emission from the surrounding superbubbles or from r136 itself , some of the reconstructed sources may be spurious or may be source blends .",
    "this is undoubtedly true for the x - ray source coincident with the cluster core r136a .",
    "we have assessed the validity of these sources by using _",
    "acis extract _ to calculate the probability that any of them is a background fluctuation , as described above .",
    "the 117 sources with less than a 0.3% likelihood of being a background fluctuation constitute our primary sourcelist ( table  [ tbl : sourcelist ] ) , while the 63 sources that have more than a 0.3% chance of being spurious background fluctuations but otherwise appear legitimate are listed as tentative sources in table  [ tbl : tentative ] .",
    "these tables are described in detail in  [ sec : ptsrcs ] .",
    "we note that 33 of the 63 tentative sources have @xmath35% ; those sources in particular should be treated with caution .",
    "all images of the acis data shown in this paper show primary source extraction regions outlined in red , while tentative sources are outlined in purple .",
    "given the highly structured diffuse emission present in this field , a few of the sources remaining in our list may be knots in this diffuse emission rather than truly point - like sources .",
    "this is much more likely to happen far from the center of the field , where psfs are large . in a longer observation",
    ", sources could be further tested for validity by considering their spectra .",
    "_ acis extract _ performs a 2-sided kolmogorov - smirnov test that could be used to make sure that the spectra extracted from a source and its local background are not identical . for this dataset , however , most sources are too faint to use this test .",
    "we estimate the limiting sensitivity of the source list in the on - axis region around r136 using koji mukai s pimms tool . to avoid the x - ray eddington bias defined by @xcite",
    ", we consider a full - band countrate limit of 5 counts in 21870 sec ( the total for all observations on ccd3 ) . assuming @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 ( a rough average of the spectral fits in table  [ tbl : apec - spec ] ) , the observed x - ray flux for a range of thermal plasmas with @xmath38 13  kev is @xmath39@xmath40  ergs  s@xmath4  @xmath37 .",
    "this gives an intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) source flux of @xmath41  ergs  s@xmath4  @xmath37 , or a limiting full - band luminosity of @xmath42  ergs  s@xmath4 in the lmc .",
    "the observation is thus not sufficiently sensitive to detect individual low - mass pre - main sequence stars , as their x - ray luminosities rarely exceed @xmath43  ergs  s@xmath4 @xcite . from a _ rosat _ survey of early - type stars @xcite",
    ", this roughly limits our detection of individual stars on - axis to @xmath44o5 and earlier .",

    "this binned image of the acis - i array also shows some of the counterparts to our _ chandra _ sources : green circles indicate 2mass sources and cyan circles show some of the x - ray sources known from previous studies .",

    "we confirm their detections of x - ray sources except for their sources cx13 and cx16 , which did not pass our criteria to be legitimate sources .",
    "they note that their cx1 is a blend of the r136a core and that the source they find associated with r140 ( cx10 ) is extended .",
    "we confirm these statements and in fact find that all nine of the sources that they identify in r136 have faint neighbors that fall within the 90% psf contour of those sources .",
    "our spectral fitting is in rough agreement with their results for the sources that we have in common .",
    "basic properties of the 180 pointlike sources are given in table  [ tbl : sourcelist ] ( for the 117 primary sources ) and table  [ tbl : tentative ] ( for the 63 tentative sources ) .",
    "the format of these tables closely follows that of @xcite tables 2 and 4 ; details on how certain columns were derived are given there .",

    "the j2000 coordinates in decimal degrees are given in columns 3 and 4 .",
    "the formal @xmath45 radial positional uncertainty based on source counts is given in column 5 .",
    "it is calculated by _",
    "acis extract _ using the following steps : ( 1 ) assume the parent distribution of the extracted counts is the observatory psf within the source s extraction region ; ( 2 ) compute the standard deviations of that truncated psf along the sky coordinate axes ; ( 3 ) divide those standard deviations by the square root of the number of counts extracted ; ( 4 ) sum the resulting single - axis positional uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "the resulting radial positional uncertainties , converted to units of arcseconds , is reported in column 5 .",
    "positional uncertainties can also be estimated from the chandra orion ultradeep project ( coup ) , which provides a large collection of  1400 sources associated with young stars across the full acis - i field of view ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "source positions for coup are based on the same _ acis extract _",
    "algorithms used here and the coup observations were first registered to the 2mass astrometric reference frame .",
    "we examined @xmath46 coup sources with astrometric near - ir counterparts and fewer than 100 net counts for acis@xmath47star positional offsets . for sources lying within @xmath48 of the aimpoint where the _ chandra _ psf is excellent , we find average offsets of @xmath49@xmath50 for sources with @xmath51 .",

    "these coup positional uncertainties should apply to 30  dor sources as well and give a sense of the systematic errors that apply in addition to the formal position errors given in tables  [ tbl : sourcelist ] and [ tbl : tentative ] .    since the _ chandra _ psf is a strong function of radial distance from the aimpoint , the off - axis angle of each source",

    "sources are extracted with a nominal 90% psf fraction unless they are crowded ; thus a value substantially less than 90% in column 11 indicates that the source was crowded and that its properties may be influenced by nearby sources .",

    "observational anomalies are noted by a set of flags in column 14 . for this field ,",
    "the only anomalies noted were sources falling in the gap between the ccd chips or on the edges of the field ; both effects cause sources to have reduced exposure time and edge sources have poor position estimates due to truncated psfs .",

    "finally , an estimate of the source s background - corrected median energy in the full spectral band completes the table . to compute this statistic we first construct a cumulative energy distribution normalized to unity by integrating the background - corrected spectrum and dividing by net counts",
    "we then search for the lowest and highest energies at which the cumulative distribution crosses 50%  these energies may be different because the background - corrected cumulative energy distribution may not be monotonic ( faint sources may have channels with negative values because that channel contained no source counts but it did contain background counts ) .",
