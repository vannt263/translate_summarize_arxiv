    "the form of the electronic dispersion relation @xmath3 in the absence of interactions plays a fundamental role in how correlations drive the formation of ordered phases .",
    "qualitative pictures like the stoner criterion for ferromagnetism simplify the input from @xmath3 and focus on the density of states at the fermi level @xmath4 .",
    "more refined treatments like the random phase approximation ( rpa ) capture phenomena such as the degree of fermi surface nesting and provide insight into how the non - interacting susceptibility determines the renormalized response of the system .",
    "both density of states and nesting issues come into play in cuprate superconductity : near - neighbor hopping on a two dimensional square lattice such as that occupied by the copper atoms of the cuo@xmath5 sheets has a van hove singularity in the density of states at half - filling which was suggested to lead to an enhanced superconducting critical temperature@xcite .",
    "likewise nesting of the fermi - surface with wave vector @xmath6 provides a natural weak - coupling explanation for the antiferromagnetic phase of the undoped parent compounds , complementing the strong - coupling heisenberg picture .",
    "nesting can also further increase the pairing transition temperature@xcite .",
    "while the single band hubbard model on a square lattice has received the most attention in modeling the cuprates , considerable interest has also focussed on the more accurate three band picture which includes not only the square lattice of copper @xmath7 orbitals but also the intervening oxygen @xmath8 orbitals @xcite .",
    "if hopping is restricted to near - neighbors , this arrangement of sites is bipartite , with , however , unequal numbers @xmath9 . in such situations , lieb showed@xcite that , at half - filling and with repulsive interaction , the hopping hamiltonian @xmath10 has a ground state with non - zero spin , @xmath11 .",
    "the key element of the physics of such ` lieb lattices ' is that the spectrum of @xmath10 consists of @xmath12 eigenvalues in + /-",
    "pairs , separated by a flat electronic band @xmath13 with @xmath14 levels . fig .",
    "[ fig : cdwpatterns2]a shows an example of a lieb geometry ( @xmath15 ) . while this structure is similar to the cuo@xmath5 planes of the high temperature superconductors , in a realistic cuprate model there is an energy difference between the copper @xmath7 and oxygen @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "the zero energy modes of @xmath10 can be easily understood : a one particle state formed by creating fermions on the four oxygen sites surrounding the center of any copper plaquette , @xmath16 , satisfies @xmath17 because hops from the oxygens onto the coppers cancel .",
    "this ` topological ' localization was emphasized earlier by sutherland @xcite .",
    "the lieb lattice , as realized in cuo@xmath5 planes of the cuprate superconductors , was investigated by varma for possible staggered current phases which might explain pseudogap behavior @xcite .",
    "novel behavior tied to the presence of a flat band includes a quantum spin hall effect driven by spin - orbit coupling and topological phase transitions , e.g.  caused by next - near - neighbor hopping @xcite . other ` decorated ' geometries exhibit flat bands , e.g.  the kagome lattice , and are similarly under investigation @xcite , a key difference being the frustrated nature of the kagome lattice .",
    "we compare results obtained for the lieb lattice to the kagome lattice and show the results we find are not generic to arbitrary flat band systems .    in this paper",
    "we address two important questions left open by lieb s theorems : [ 1 ] what are the natures of the charge and superconducting response functions ? [ 2 ] what are the implications of the absence of a minimum in @xmath3 for superconductivity ( sc ) or bec in a flat band ? it has been suggested that the presence of interactions renormalizes the flat band and induces an effective minimum so that bec can still occur@xcite or that the infinite density of states in the flat band favours the emergence of sc or other kinds of order@xcite .",

    "the attractive fermion hubbard model ( ahm ) considered here develops superconducting phases at low temperatures- a bcs phase at weak coupling and bec pairing at strong coupling@xcite , with a crossover between these two extreme cases . on lattices which do not have special features in their densities of states@xcite , and in sufficiently high dimension",

    "this is closer to the bec limit , and hence to possible experiments on bosonic atoms .",

    "the absence of the sign problem in the attractive case , @xmath34 , allows simulations over a wide range of fillings .",
    "we focus our attention on the densities on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and on intra - unit - cell ( ie near - neighbor and next - near neighbor ) density - density correlations , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "we complement these dqmc calculation with mean field theory ( mft ) . in this approach , on each site , the attractive interaction is written in term of the operators @xmath47 the vector @xmath48 is obtained from the usual spin operator by a particle - hole transformation for the down spin .",
    "the mean field decoupling corresponds to approximating , on each site , the interaction term @xmath49 by @xmath50 , leading to three mean field parameters @xmath51 . for repulsive interaction , this decoupling is the analog of the usual su(2 ) decoupling in the spin channels  @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath52 are determined by minimizing the free energy .",
    "both techniques work in the grand canonical ensemble , which could cause a problem when trying to access a given density in the partially filled flat band .",
    "this is not the case as the flat band acquires a width due to interactions in the exact dqmc treatment and as the su(2 ) symmetry allows us to circumvent this problem in the mf approximation ( see below ) .",
    "we begin by showing the changes in the occupations @xmath53 and @xmath54 on the individual orbitals as the total density @xmath55 increases ( fig .  [",
    "fig : n0_n1_vs_rho ] ) . in the noninteracting limit , @xmath56 must be nonnegative , and we observe this",
    ". however , for @xmath57 we see that the @xmath7 occupation decreases with increasing @xmath55 .",
    "we interpret this in terms of a transition from the @xmath1 cdw ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cdwpatterns2]b ) to the @xmath2 cdw ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cdwpatterns2]c ) . @xmath58 favors doubly occupied sites , but to second order in perturbation theory such paired sites are lower in energy by @xmath59 for each empty adjacent site . at low densities ( double ) occupation of the four - fold coordinated @xmath7 orbitals is favored , but as @xmath55 exceeds 2/3 it becomes advantageous to occupy the more numerous @xmath8 orbitals and empty the @xmath7 band .",
    "we emphasize an important feature of cdw patterns on this lattice : because the @xmath7 and @xmath8 sites are inequivalent , there is a ` trivial ' difference in charge densities which does not reflect any spontaneous symmetry breaking . however , cdw order is also present due to correlations , and the fact that it is energetically favorable , @xmath60 , to have doubly occupied and empty sites adjacent .",
    "additional interest in the orbital occupation evolution concerns its possible implications for charge transfer processes in cuprate pairing .",
    "because they favor @xmath7 wave pairing symmetry , it is generally accepted that spin fluctuations provide the majority of the ` pairing glue ' in high @xmath61 materials @xcite .",
    "however , arguments have been made @xcite in favor of a possible role of charge fluctuations between the copper and oxygen orbitals driven by a repulsive interaction @xmath62 .",
    "such fluctuations would be reflected in a large response of @xmath63 to the orbital energy difference @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ fig : n0_n1_vs_rho ] emphasizes that , even in the absence of @xmath62 , there is nontrivial structure in the orbital occupations .",
    "thus , much as the large @xmath65 antiferromagnetic susceptibility highlights spin fluctuations on the square lattice , the observation of unusual charge transfer in the lieb lattice at @xmath66 might indicate a role for charge fluctuations there .    because it probes the double occupancy @xmath67 ( local pair formation ) the local moment",
    "can also provide interesting insight .",
    "@xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2_vs_rho_u-4 ] .",
    "it is evident that @xmath69 does not change as the density is increased in the range @xmath70 , _",
    "i.e. _  as the flat band is being filled .",
    "this result can be understood within mft : for chemical potential @xmath71 , the su(2 ) invariance implies that the mean field ground state energy is invariant under a global rotation of the mean field pseudo - spins @xmath52 .",
    "more precisely , in the ground state , @xmath52 shows a ferromagnetic order in the @xmath72 plane ( pairing order ) and an antiferromagnetic order along the @xmath73 axis ( cdw order ) .",
    "this su(2 ) symmetry implies , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the norm of the pseudo - spin .",
    "the maximum value for @xmath46 is @xmath78 and occurs at half - filling ; @xmath46 vanishes when the density reaches @xmath79 . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the numerical mft values are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "although the maximum value of @xmath46 depends on @xmath58 , we have found that the value of @xmath85 is always @xmath86 .",
    "hence , for @xmath71 , the mean field @xmath46 always vanishes at fillings @xmath87 , _",

    "[ fig : ps_vs_rho_u-4 - 8 ] . finally , one has @xmath88 . since , at the mean - field level , @xmath89 is independent of the density within the range @xmath90 , this explains the plateau in fig .  [",
    "fig : m2_vs_rho_u-4 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that this behavior is observed in the qmc results fig .",

    "this result is in agreement with the mean field results : for @xmath97 , the mean field pair structure factor is given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , in very good agreement with the qmc . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the mean field results also depict a dome - shape behavior , with a maximum around the centre , a behavior quite similar to a single band situation .",

    "@xmath46 decreases much more as the lattice size is increased than for @xmath95 , and a finite size scaling analysis ( inset ( b ) ) suggests the absence of lro at @xmath102 .",
    "we thus have local pair formation with no clear long range coherence .",
    "while lro pair order is likely to develop at a yet lower energy scale , it is suggestive that it is absent at temperatures for which superconductivity would be readily visible in dispersing band geometries like the 2d square lattice : the flat band appears to be impeding the bosons ( locally formed pairs ) from forming a bec . for @xmath101 ,",
    "pairing lro is well established at @xmath103 on a square lattice . in the flat band model considered here , @xmath102 is insufficiently cold .",

    "if these phenomena are generic to all flat band geometries , we compare our results with the case of the kagome lattice .",
    "we choose the sign of the hopping term so that the dispersionless band is the lowest of the three kagome bands .",

    "we see that the novel features that were observed in the lieb lattice ( figures [ fig : m2_vs_rho_u-4 ] and [ fig : ps_vs_rho_u-4 - 8 ] ) are no longer present .",
    "specifically , the local momemt @xmath105 is not constant , nor does the pair structure factor @xmath46 become zero at the edge of the flat band .",
    "this reflects the absence of competition between cdw and sc order in the kagome case .",
    "moreover , we do not observe a sharp change in the behavior of either of these observables when the system transitions from the first to the second band .",
    "there are , however , signatures as the density takes the fermi level from the second to the third band , both of which have non - zero width .",
    "this occurs at @xmath107 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath46 and @xmath105 at low density is not peculiar ; indeed it is the one observed in most cases , with @xmath46 and @xmath105 roughly proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "we observe a similar behavior in the low or high density limit for the lieb lattice ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : m2_vs_rho_u-4 ] and [ fig : ps_vs_rho_u-4 - 8 ] ) .",
    "this comparison between the lieb and kagome lattices emphasizes that peculiar behavior , like constant magnetization , observed in the lieb case can not be ascribed solely to a flat band . in the presence of interactions , there is no generic evolution of magnetic and pairing correlations within a flat band . instead",

    "charge and pair correlations in the ahm in the lieb lattice , which has a flat band , have been computed .",
    "as the flat band is filled , the density on the minority (  copper \" ) sites declines even though the total density grows , demonstrating a specific model in which charge transfer signatures are strong .",
    "such behaviour has attracted interest in the context of cuprate superconductivity and materials like bapbbio@xmath108 , where it has been proposed that the exchange of charge fluctuations can mediate pairing in a way analogous to the exchange of spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we have also presented detailed data on the competition between the pairing and cdw response as the density is tuned . at stronger values of the attraction , pairing correlations decrease significantly as the lattice size increases , suggesting that lro is inhibited by the flat band dispersion relative to strongly dispersing bands .",
    "finally we compared our results to the kagome lattice , another example of a flat band geometry , and showed that the phenomena observed are not generically present in all flat band systems .",
    "together , these results characterize ` traditional ' charge and pairing correlations , forming a useful context to attempts to explore more exotic topological phases in flat band systems .                                                  in a three band model of cuo@xmath5 planes ,",
