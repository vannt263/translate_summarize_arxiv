    "for tricritical phenomena , the highest dimension in which non - classical behaviour can be observed is @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "consequently , 2d tricritical phenomena has been the subject of a large number of previous investigations , employing a wide variety of techniques , including series expansions @xcite , mean - field theory @xcite , renormalisation group ( rg ) @xcite , transfer matrix @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite and monte carlo rg methods @xcite . to date",
    ", however , this interest has focused almost exclusively on lattice - based spin models such as the blume - capel model or the spin-@xmath1 next - nearest - neighbour ising model . in this paper",
    ", we report the first detailed simulation study of 2d tricritical behaviour in an off - lattice spin fluid model .    the model we consider is a simplified representation for a liquid of two - state molecules , and has been the subject of a number of previous studies in both its classical and quantum regimes @xcite . in the present work , however , we shall consider only the classical limit , for which the configurational energy is given by :    @xmath2    with @xmath3 and where @xmath4 is chosen to be a hard disk potential with diameter @xmath5 .",
    "the distance - dependent spin coupling parameter @xmath6 is assigned a square well form :    @xmath7    the phase diagram of this model is expected to correspond to the situation depicted schematically in figure  [ fig : pdschem ] . for high temperatures , there exists a line of ising critical points ( the so - called ` critical line ' ) separating a ferromagnetic fluid phase from a paramagnetic fluid phase .",
    "the particle density varies continuously across this line .",
    "as one follows the critical line to lower temperatures , however , the size of the particle density fluctuations grows progressively . precisely at the tricritical point ,",
    "the fluctuations in both the particle density and magnetisation are simultaneously divergent .",
    "lowering the temperature still further results in a phase separation between a low density paramagnetic gas and a high density ferromagnetic liquid .",
    "for subtricritical temperatures , the phase transition between these two phases is first order .",
    "owing to the interplay between the density and magnetisation fluctuations , the tricritical properties of the spin fluid system are expected to differ qualitatively from those on the critical line .",
    "general universality arguments @xcite predict that for a given spatial dimensionality , fluids with short - ranged interactions should exhibit the same tricritical properties as lattice - based spin systems .",
    "however , since fluids possess a continuous translational symmetry that lattice models do not , this proposal needs be checked .",
    "additionally , experience with ` ordinary ' ( ising ) critical behaviour in simple fluids such as the lennard - jones fluid @xcite , shows that the reduced symmetry of fluids can profoundly influence certain non - universal aspects of the critical properties .",
    "principal among these , are the directions of the relevant scaling fields associated with the fixed point , and the distribution functions of observables such as the particle density and energy .",
    "it is thus of interest to assess the extent of these ` field - mixing ' effects in the tricritical fluid and to compare it with the situation at the liquid - vapour critical point of simple fluids .",
    "an accurate determination of the universal forms of the tricritical scaling operator distribution is also of considerable value .",
    "such distributions are _ unique _ to a universality class and hence knowledge of their forms would be of considerable practical utility to future simulation studies of 2d tricriticality , serving as they do to simplify the computational task of locating the tricritical parameters .",
    "moreover , as we shall see , the forms of the scaling operator distribution functions can impart important physical insight into the nature of the tricritical fluctuations .",
    "our paper is broadly organised as follows . in section  [ sec : meth ] we describe the finite - size scaling methods and other computational techniques employed in the study .",
    "we then proceed in section  [ sec : res ] to detail the application of these techniques to monte carlo simulations of both the 2d spin fluid model described above , and the 2d blume - capel .",
    "the simulations yield accurate estimates of the location of the tricritical point for both models , as well as the universal forms of the tricritical scaling operator distributions and the directions of the relevant scaling fields . in the case of the spin fluid model , the estimates for the tricritical point parameters",
    "are compared with the results of a mean field calculation .",
    "finally section  [ sec : concs ] details our conclusions .",
    "the techniques we employ in this work have been previously developed in the context of simulation studies of ising critical phenomena in a variety of fluid models , including a decorated lattice gas model @xcite , a lattice model for polymer mixtures @xcite , and both the two and three - dimensional lennard - jones fluids @xcite . in common with the strategy pursued in these previous works",
    ", we have chosen to work within the grand canonical ensemble , use of which affords effective treatment of the particle density fluctuations which are a central feature of fluid critical behaviour .    let us assume our system to be contained in a volume @xmath8 , with @xmath0 in the simulations to be described later .",
    "the grand partition function is given by    @xmath9 } \\label{eq : pf}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the particle number , @xmath11 is the inverse temperature , @xmath12 is the chemical potential and @xmath13 is the uniform applied magnetic field .",
    "the observables of chief concern to the present study are the ( reduced ) particle density    @xmath14    the configurational energy density ( which we express in units of @xmath15 ) @xmath16 and the magnetisation .",
    "@xmath17    the coarse - grained behaviour of the system in the vicinity of the tricritical point is controlled by three relevant scaling fields @xcite which we denote @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in general these scaling fields",
    "are each expected to comprise linear combinations of the three thermodynamic fields @xmath20 and @xmath13 @xcite . for the spin fluid model considered in this work ,",
    "however , the configurational energy is invariant with respect to sign reversal of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this special symmetry implies that the tricritical point lies in the symmetry plane @xmath21 , and that the scaling field @xmath19 coincides with the magnetic field @xmath13 , being orthogonal to the @xmath22 plane containing the other two scaling fields , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus we can write    @xmath25    where the subscript @xmath26 signifies tricritical values and the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are system - specific ` field mixing ' parameters that control the directions of the scaling fields in the @xmath12@xmath29 plane .",
    "the scaling fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 are depicted schematically in figure  [ fig : pdschem](b ) .",
    "one sees that @xmath23 is tangent to the coexistence curve at the tricritical point @xcite , so that the field mixing parameter @xmath28 may be identified simply as the limiting tricritical gradient of the coexistence curve .",
    "the scaling field @xmath24 , on the other hand , is permitted to take a general direction in the @xmath12@xmath29 plane which does not necessarily have to coincide with any special direction of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "conjugate to each of the scaling fields are scaling operators , defined by the requirements    @xmath30    from which it follows ( utilising equations  [ eq : pf ] and [ eqn : scafldsa][eqn : scafldsc ] ) , that    @xmath31 \\\\ { \\cal e } & = & \\frac{1}{1-sr}[u - r\\rho ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    motivated by our experience with ordinary critical phenomena in simple fluids",
    "@xcite we make the following finite - size scaling _",
    "@xcite for the limiting ( large l ) near - tricritical distribution of @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a universal scaling function , the @xmath35 are non - universal metric factors and the @xmath36 are the standard tricritical eigenvalue exponents @xcite . precisely at the tricritical point ,",
    "the tricritical scaling fields vanish identically and the last three arguments of equation  [ eq : ansatz ] can be simply dropped , yielding    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is a universal and scale invariant function characterising the tricritical fixed point .    in what follows we",
    "shall explicitly test the proposed universality of equation  [ eq : ptri ] for the case of the spin fluid model , by obtaining the form of @xmath38 and comparing it with that for the tricritical 2d blume - capel model .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations of the spin fluid model were performed using a metropolis algorithm within the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "particle insertions and deletions were carried out using the prescription of adams @xcite . when attempting particle insertions the spin of the candidate particle was randomly assigned the value @xmath39 or @xmath40 with equal probability .",
    "spin flip attempts were performed at the same frequency as insertion / deletion attempts .    in order to facilitate efficient computation of interparticle interactions , the periodic simulation space of volume",
    "@xmath41 was partitioned into @xmath42 cubic cells each of side @xmath43 , corresponding to the interaction range of the interparticle potential ( cf .",
    "equation  [ eq : pot ] ) .",
    "this strategy ensures that interactions emanating from particles in a given cell extend at most to particles in the @xmath44 neighbouring cells .",
    "we chose to study three system sizes corresponding to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , containing , at coexistence , average particle numbers of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 system sizes , equilibration periods of @xmath50 monte carlo transfer attempts _ per cell _",
    "( mcs ) were utilised , while for the @xmath51 and @xmath52 system sizes up to @xmath53 mcs were employed .",
    "sampling frequencies ranged from @xmath54 mcs for the @xmath55 system to @xmath56 mcs for the @xmath52 system .",
    "production runs amounted to @xmath57 mcs for the @xmath55 and up to @xmath58 mcs for the @xmath52 system size . at coexistence",
    "the average acceptance rate for particle transfers was approximately @xmath59 , while for spin flip attempts the acceptance rate was approximately @xmath60 .    during the production runs ,",
    "the joint probability distribution @xmath32 was obtained in the form of a histogram . in order to increase computational efficiency ,",
    "the histogram extrapolation technique @xcite was employed .",
    "use of this technique permits histograms obtained at one set of model parameters to be reweighted to yield estimates appropriate to another set of model parameters .",
    "the method is particularly effective close to a critical point where , owing to the large fluctuations , a single simulation permits extrapolation over the entire critical region .    as an aid to locating the tricritical point ,",
    "the cumulant intersection method was employed @xcite .",
    "the fourth order cumulant ratio @xmath61 is a quantity that characterises the form of a distribution @xcite .",
    "it is defined in terms of the fourth and second moments of a given distribution    @xmath62    the tricritical scale invariance of the distributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , ( as expressed by equation  [ eq : ptri ] ) , implies that at the tricritical point ( and modulo corrections to scaling ) , the cumulant values for all system sizes should be equal .",
    "the tricritical parameters can thus be found by measuring @xmath61 for a number of temperatures and system sizes along the first order line , according to the prescription given below . precisely at the tricritical temperature",
    "the curves of @xmath61 corresponding to the various system sizes are expected to intersect one another at a single common point .      in seeking to confirm the proposed universality linking the tricritical point of the 2d spin fluid model to those of 2d lattice models , it is first necessary to determine the tricritical operator distribution functions for a simple lattice model . to this end",
    "we have also performed a simulation study of the blume - capel model on a periodic square lattice , the hamiltonian of which is given by    @xmath65    with @xmath66 . here @xmath13 is a uniform magnetic field and @xmath67 is the so - called ` crystal field ' . as with the 2d spin fluid model , the symmetry of the configurational energy under spin sign reversal implies that the tricritical point lies in the symmetry plane @xmath21 .",
    "previous mcrg @xcite investigations place the tricritical point of the 2d blume - capel model at @xmath68 , while a more recent transfer matrix study @xcite gives @xmath69 . using these estimates as an initial guide",
    ", we performed extensive monte carlo simulations of the model using a vectorised metropolis algorithm on a cray - ymp .",
    "four system sizes of linear extent @xmath70 were studied and following equilibration , runs ranging from @xmath71 monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) for the l=12 system , to @xmath72 mcs for the l=40 system were performed .",
    "the quantities measured in the course of these runs were    @xmath73    here we note that @xmath74 plays the same rle as the density in the spin fluid model , being discontinuous across the first order line but continuous on the critical line .",
    "this fact is most clearly evident in the lattice gas representation of the blume - capel model , where the crystal field @xmath67 appears as a chemical potential @xcite .    during the simulations ,",
    "the joint distribution @xmath75 was collected in the form of a histogram . to determine the locus of the first order line ( and",
    "hence locate the tricritical point in which it formally terminates ) , the coexistence symmetry criterion for the operator distribution @xmath76 was utilised .",
    "this criterion is the analogue for asymmetric first order transitions , of the order - parameter distribution symmetry condition applicable to symmetric first order transitions such as that of the subcritical simple ising model @xcite . for a given temperature @xmath29 , the first order transition point",
    "can thus be located by tuning the crystal field @xmath67 and the value of the field mixing parameter @xmath27 , within the histogram reweighting scheme , until the operator distribution @xmath76 is symmetric in @xmath77 .",
    "the first order line and its finite - size analytical extension @xcite was determined in this way for temperatures in the range @xmath78@xmath79 , and for each of the @xmath80 system sizes .",
    "the corresponding values of the cumulant ratio @xmath81 _ along _ this coexistence line are presented in figure  [ fig : bc_ul ] as a function of the temperature . to within numerical uncertainties",
    "the cumulant values for each system size intersect at a common temperature , which we estimate as @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding estimate for the tricritical field is @xmath83 .",
    "clearly these values are in excellent agreement with the aforementioned estimates of previous studies .    in the following subsection",
    "we compare the measured forms of the tricritical operator distributions @xmath84 and @xmath64 of the 2d blume - capel , with those of the 2d spin fluid model .",
    "the procedure for locating the tricritical point of the 2d spin fluid model followed the same pattern as that for the 2d blume - capel model described above , except that in the present case no prior estimates for the tricritical point were available .",
    "it was thus necessary to search for the approximate location of the tricritical point by performing a number of short runs in which a temperature was chosen and the chemical potential tuned .",
    "observations of the behaviour of the density from these short runs suggested that the tricritical point lay close to the parameters @xmath85 .",
    "having obtained an approximate estimate of the location of the tricritical point , long runs were carried out for each of the three system sizes @xmath86 . as with the blume - capel model , the coexistence symmetry condition",
    "was then applied to the operator distribution @xmath76 in conjunction with the histogram reweighting scheme , in order to determine the first order line and its analytic extension in the @xmath12@xmath29 plane .",
    "the locus of this line is shown in figure  [ fig : mu_t ] , while the measured values of @xmath87 along this coexistence line are shown in figure  [ fig : fl_ul ] for the three system sizes @xmath86 .",
    "clearly the curves of figure  [ fig : fl_ul ] have a single well - defined intersection point , from which we estimate the tricritical temperature as being @xmath88 .",
    "the associated estimate for the chemical potential is @xmath89 .",
    "typical near - tricritical configurations for the @xmath52 system are shown in figure    in figure  [ fig : collapse ] we present the forms of the operator distributions @xmath90 , @xmath76 and @xmath64 corresponding to the designated values of the tricritical parameters .",
    "the value of the field mixing parameter @xmath28 implicit in the definition of @xmath91 , was assigned the value @xmath92 , as obtained from the measured gradient of the phase boundary in the @xmath12@xmath29 plane at the tricritical point .",
    "the value of the field mixing parameter @xmath27 was assigned , as previously described , so that @xmath76 satisfied the symmetry condition .",
    "however , the resulting estimates of @xmath27 were found to exhibit a systematic finite - size dependence .",
    "this effect has also been previously noted ( albeit with much reduced magnitude ) in a recent study of critical phenomena in the lennard - jones fluid , and is traceable to the finite - size dependence of the average critical energy @xcite .",
    "for the three system sizes , @xmath86 , we found @xmath93 respectively .",
    "interestingly , these values are at least an order of magnitude smaller than those measured at the critical point of the 2d and 3d lennard - jones fluid , a finding which we discuss further in section  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "this smallness implies that the scaling field @xmath24 almost coincides with the @xmath12 axis of the phase diagram .",
    "also included in figure  [ fig : collapse ] are the measured tricritical operator distributions for the 2d blume - capel model . in accordance with convention",
    ", all the operator distributions have been scaled to unit norm and variance .",
    "clearly in each instance and for each system size , the operator distributions collapse extremely well onto one another as well as onto those of the tricritical blume - capel model .",
    "the measured scaling operator distributions also serve to furnish estimates of the eigenvalue exponents @xmath94 and @xmath95 characterising the three relevant scaling fields .",
    "these exponents are accessible via the respective finite - size scaling behaviour of tricritical distributions of @xmath90 , @xmath76 and @xmath64 .",
    "specifically , consideration of the scaling form  [ eq : ptri ] shows that the typical size of the fluctuations in a given operator @xmath96 vary with system size like @xmath97 .",
    "comparison of the standard deviation of a given operator distributions as a function of system size thus affords estimates of the appropriate exponents . from the measured variance of the spin fluid operator distributions , we find @xmath98 . as far as @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    "are concerned , these estimates are in excellent agreement with exact conjectures @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the situation regarding the eigenvalue exponent @xmath95 , on the other hand , is not so satisfactory , there being a sizable discrepancy with the exact value of @xmath102 .",
    "this discrepancy stems , we believe , from two sources .",
    "firstly , since the operator distribution @xmath64 is highly sensitive with respect to the designation of the value of the field mixing parameter @xmath28 implicit in the definition of @xmath91 , small uncertainties in the estimate of @xmath28 can lead to significant larger errors in the measured variance of @xmath64 .",
    "a similar effect was also previously observed at the liquid - vapour critical point of the lennard - jones fluid @xcite .",
    "secondly , and as we discuss in section  [ sec : concs ] , the near gaussian character of @xmath64 signifies the absence of strong fluctuations in the @xmath91 , in which case it is questionable whether a finite - size scaling can be reliable applied to @xmath64 at all .    in view of this problem",
    "we have adopted a rather different approach for measuring @xmath95 based on the scaling properties of @xmath81 , a quantity which does show strong fluctuations and which is also insensitive to the designation of the field mixing parameter @xmath28 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , that the maximum slope of the cumulant ratio @xmath103 near @xmath104 varies with system size like @xmath105 . using the histogram extrapolation technique ,",
    "we have obtained the temperature dependence of this slope for the spin fluid model .",
    "the results yield the estimate @xmath106 , which agrees to within error with the exact conjecture .",
    "turning now to the observables @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we plot in figure  [ fig : flbare ] the measured distributions of these quantities at the assigned tricritical parameters .",
    "here we note that as is the case with ordinary critical phenomena in the lennard - jones fluid @xcite , the energy distribution @xmath109 differs qualitatively in form from the operator distribution @xmath64 .",
    "this finding , the origin of which is explained in detail in reference  @xcite , reflects the coupling of the tricritical energy fluctuations to the density , the latter of which are stronger and thus dominate for large @xmath110 .",
    "the influence of this coupling is also discernible as a small asymmetry in the tricritical density distribution .",
    "for the average tricritical density we find @xmath111 , while for the average tricritical energy density we find @xmath112 .",
    "the average magnetisation is of course strictly zero on symmetry grounds .",
    "finally in this subsection , table  [ tab : uls ] summarises the measured values of the fourth order cumulant ratios @xmath113 for each of the three scaling operator distributions at the assigned values of the tricritical parameters .      in this section",
    "we describe a simple mean - field calculation of the tricritical parameters of the 2d spin fluid .",
    "let @xmath114 denote the pressure in the system for a given chemical potential @xmath12 and volume @xmath115 in the thermodynamic limit , where the equilibrium density @xmath116 is given by the ratio of the average number of particles @xmath117 and the volume @xmath115 , @xmath118",

    "two phase coexistence between a gas phase at density @xmath134 and a liquid phase phase at density @xmath135 is given by equal pressure in the two phases    @xmath136    this condition determines the mean  field chemical potential @xmath137 for phase coexistence via eq .",
    "( [ mf1 ] ) . implementing this criterion numerically",
    ", we find @xmath138 @xmath139 .",
    "clearly this estimate for @xmath140 seriously overestimates the measured tricritical temperature ( @xmath141 ) showing that mean field calculations of this type can not be relied upon to provide accurate tricritical data , at least for 2d systems .",
    "in summary we have demonstrated that the tricritical ordering operator distributions of the 2d spin fluid can be mapped into excellent correspondence with those of the 2d blume - capel model .",
    "the existence of such a mapping represents perhaps the most stringent test of universality .",
    "there can thus be little doubt that despite their very different microscopic character , the two systems do indeed share a common fixed point .    with regard to the scaling operator distribution themselves",
    ", we note that the form of @xmath142 is ( to within the precision of our measurements ) essentially gaussian , as evidenced by the very small value of the cumulant ratio @xmath143 .",
    "this guassian behaviour implies that the tricritical fluctuations in @xmath91 are extremely weak and is thus a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "this weakness is further manifest in the very small measured values of the field mixing parameter @xmath27 , as well as in the near absence of asymmetry in the tricritical density distributions , a situation which contrast markedly with that of the 2d and 3d lennard - jones fluids , where much stronger field mixing effects are observed in the density distribution @xcite .    finally , the tricritical form of @xmath144 merits special comment .",
    "we note that the _ three - peaked _ form of this distribution differs radically from the universal magnetisation distribution of the critical ising model , which is strongly _",
    "double_-peaked in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the existence of a three peaked structure for tricritical phenomena reflects the additional coupling that arises between the magnetisation and the density fluctuations .",
    "specifically , the central peak corresponds to fluctuation to small density , which are concomitant with an overall reduction in the magnitude of the magnetisation ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : config ] ) . were one , however , to depart from the tricritical point along the critical line , these density fluctuations would gradually die out and a crossover to a magnetisation distribution having the double - peaked ising form would be expected . in future work",
