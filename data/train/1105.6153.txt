    "the profound finding of the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite has provided a framework to describe the strongly coupled field theories in a weakly coupled gravitational system .",
    "recently , this correspondence has been applied to study the holographic model of superconductors in which a remarkable connection has been observed between the gravitational physics and the condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the bulk ads black hole becomes unstable and scalar hair condenses below a critical temperature .",
    "the instability of the bulk black hole corresponds to a second order phase transition from normal state to superconducting state which brings the spontaneous u(1 ) symmetry breaking . in the boundary dual cft",
    ", these properties exhibit the behavior of the superconductor @xcite . due to the potential applications to the condensed matter physics",
    ", the condensation in bulk ads black holes has been investigated extensively , for reviews , see refs . @xcite and references therein .    in additional to the bulk ads black hole spacetime ,",
    "recently it was found that a holographic model can be constructed in the bulk ads soliton background to describe the insulator and superconductor phase transition @xcite . adding the chemical potential to the ads soliton",
    ", a second order phase transition can happen when the chemical potential is over a critical value .",
    "this phase transition can be used to describe the transition between the insulator and superconductor , while it is different from the hawking - page phase transition between the ricci flat ads black hole and the ads soliton @xcite . taking the backreaction of the matter fields into account",
    ", it was argued that the order of the phase transition can be changed from the second to the first if the backreaction is strong enough @xcite . in the st@xmath0ckelberg mechanism , rich physics on the phase transition between the holographic insulator and superconductor in the ads",
    "soliton background has been observed @xcite .",
    "further investigations on various insulator and superconductor phase transitions in different theories of gravity have been carried out @xcite .    in most cases ,",
    "the holographic superconductors were studied numerically .",
    "ideally , one would like to have a full analytic description of the phase transition and condensation phenomena .",
    "in addition to back up numerical results , the analytic description can help to gain more insights , for example it may tell what properties of the action decide the mean - field behaviors etc .",
    "recently , there appeared two analytic approaches in parallel to the numerical calculation .",
    "one is the analytic matching method which was first proposed in @xcite and later refined in @xcite . with this method",
    ", we can calculate the critical temperature analytically within a few percent in the best case .",
    "this analytic approach has been extended to derive the upper critical magnetic field when the holographic superconductor is immersed in constant external magnetic fields @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "this analytic method can keep valid only when the matching point is chosen within an appropriate range @xcite .",
    "however the matching method is not effective to describe the ads soliton , neither can it be used to derive the critical exponents for the condensation near the critical temperature .",
    "the mean - field critical exponent @xmath1 at the critical temperature comes mostly from numerically solving the holographic systems and doing data fitting . in @xcite",
    ", the authors extended the variational method for the sturm - liouville ( s - l ) eigenvalue problem to analytically calculate the critical exponent near the critical temperature .",
    "this method was further applied to analytically study some properties of holographic superconductors in ads black hole backgrounds in einstein gravity @xcite and einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite in the probe limit , respectively .",
    "an analytic study by using the s - l method on the phase transition between the holographic insulator and superconductor was done in @xcite in the einstein gravity .",
    "it is of interest to further generalize the s - l method to study holographic superconductor developed in the ads soliton background in the gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the condensation phenomena and the phase transition between the s - wave holographic insulator and superconductor in the gauss - bonnet gravity were investigated numerically in @xcite .",
    "we will also extend the investigation of the p - wave holographic insulator and superconductor phase transition with gauss - bonnet correction in this work , which has not been constructed as far as we know .",
    "it is not trivial to analytically study the condensation and the phase transition by taking into account of the influence of the gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "besides to be used to check numerical computation , the analytic investigation can clearly disclose the critical exponent of the system at the critical temperature and the influence of the gauss - bonnet factor in the phase transition . in the ads soliton background ,",
    "we will compare two available analytic methods and argue that the s - l method is more effective for the analytic study of the condensation .",
    "the plan of the work is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the ads soliton background in the gauss - bonnet gravity . in sec .",
    "iii we explore the s - wave insulator and superconductor phase transition with gauss - bonnet correction . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the p - wave case .",
    "we conclude in the last section with our main results .",
    "in order to study the superconducting phase dual to the guass - bonnet ads soliton configuration in the probe limit , we start with the five - dimensional ads soliton in the gauss - bonnet gravity in the form @xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the tip of the soliton which is a conical singularity in this solution , @xmath5 is the gauss - bonnet coupling constant and @xmath6 is the ads radius .",

    "we will apply the s - l method @xcite to analytically investigate the properties of the s - wave holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition in the gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we will calculate the critical chemical potential to accommodate the phase transition and analytically derive the critical exponent of condensation operator .",
    "in addition , we will derive the relation between the charge density and the chemical potential near the phase transition point and examine the effect of the gauss - bonnet factor .      introducing a new variable @xmath41 , we can rewrite eqs .",
