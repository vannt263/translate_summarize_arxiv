    "a staple of fantasy and science fiction , cloaking devices allow the cloaked magician , wizard , or spaceship to move about undetected .",
    "the ideal cloaking device would hide an object from the view of any observer when illuminated by any source , and would itself be invisible to any external observer .",
    "we argue here that such a cloak must unfortunately remain forever within the realm of fantasy and fiction , and that the more prosaic reality of invisibility devices is fundamentally limited by special relativity .",
    "the scientific study of cloaking devices began with the mathematical manipulations of what has become known as transformation optics or transformation electromagnetics @xcite . in this approach",
    ", maxwell s equations are manipulated through a suitable mathematical operation ( transformation ) such that the path of propagating light is diverted around a region and continues on the other side as if the region were not there ; as if it were invisible .",
    "this operation simultaneously derives the required properties of the cloak .",
    "one quickly runs into difficulty when trying to build a cloaking device .",
    "if the transformation is purely spatial , as in @xcite and many subsequent papers , then the resulting mathematical description of the cloak lives up to the fictional standard ; light avoids the cloak cavity and emerges on the other side at the same position and time as would light traveling through vacuum .",
    "in such a cloak , both the amplitude and phase of light passing through the cloak are preserved relative to uncloaked light irrespective of light frequency , and we refer to this as a `` full - spectrum perfect cloak . ''",
    "but since the spatial path through the cloak is longer than the uncloaked distance , the speed of light through the cloak must be larger than the vacuum speed of light @xmath0 , and thus in reality the full - spectrum perfect cloak can not cloak signals without violating causality @xcite .",
    "in other words , the trajectory of light in the cloak becomes space - like , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4dcloak ] .    .",
    "inside the cloak their paths vary from time - like to space - like ( indicating regions of faster than light propagation ) but their average behavior is null . throughgoing rays exit the cloak at the same space - time events as would uncloaked , unobstructed rays . ]    there is an exception to causality violation : the indistinguishability of wavefronts in a pure single - frequency wave implies its speed is not restricted by causality , but it also can not carry a signal .",
    "such single - frequency cloaks @xcite are physically realizable through the use of resonant metamaterials @xcite , but by causality and the kramers - kronig relation such single - frequency cloaks are heavily dispersive @xcite .",
    "we refer to them as `` single - frequency perfect cloaks '' because any such cloak perfectly cloaks both the amplitude and the phase of light carrying the right frequency  the operational frequency of this cloak  in its inertial frame .",
    "one may attempt to circumvent causality violation by allowing light to take extra time to get through the cloak , which is equivalent to including a time transformation in addition to a spatial transformation @xcite . in this case a light ray exits the cloak at the same spatial position as would light traveling through vacuum , but at a later time relative to an uncloaked ray .",
    "such a cloak preserves the amplitude of throughgoing light but does not preserve the phase , and we refer to such cloaks as `` amplitude cloaks . ''",
    "the trajectories of light through an amplitude cloak are time - like , so causality is respected and the cloak may have broadband operationality . since the phase is irrelevant for incoherent natural light ,",
    "amplitude cloaking is an attractive solution .",
    "thus there are two reasonable , if not mathematically ideal , options for physically realizable cloaks : single - frequency perfect cloaks and amplitude cloaks .",
    "the next question is whether either type of cloak functions as desired by allowing a cloaked wizard to move about undetected .",
    "it turns out that both categories of cloaks are betrayed by simple physical effects of special relativity in the presence of relative motion between cloak and source or detector .    for single - frequency perfect cloaks , detailed investigations",
    "have recently shown that the doppler shift between source and moving cloak may expose the cloak s presence @xcite .",
    "simply put , the single - frequency perfect cloak will not work if the doppler - shifted frequency is not equal to the operational frequency , and the amount of scattering increases in proportion to the relative velocity between reference source and cloak .",
    "however , one may fine tune the source frequency , cloak speed , and ray direction such that the doppler - shifted frequency is equal to the operational frequency of the cloak in the cloak frame @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cloak becomes fundamentally non - reciprocal in the sense that light entering the cloak may be red(blue)-shifted to the cloak s operational frequency and pass through as desired , but if that light is subsequently retroreflected and passes through the cloak in the opposite direction it will be blue(red)-shifted even further away from the operational frequency .",
    "we show here that fresnel - fizeau drag @xcite of light by amplitude cloaks in relative motion causes fundamental image distortions . while a single - frequency perfect cloak in motion can be fine tuned by adjusting the operational or source frequency , fine tuning an amplitude cloak to compensate for fresnel - fizeau drag would , if at all possible , require a complete redesign of the cloak to such an extent that it would no longer function as desired in the rest frame of the cloak , nor in any other frame .",
    "image distortions induced by an amplitude cloak in relative motion are therefore unavoidable in all but a single frame of reference .",
    "this same conclusion immediately lends itself to non - cloak invisibility devices , such as the invisible sphere @xcite , and to other broadband transformation - optics - based devices .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : fresneldrag ] we show that fresnel - fizeau drag in an amplitude cloak introduces image distortions , except for the special case of light propagation parallel to cloak velocity , for all but a single choice of inertial observer . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] we illustrate the extent of such distortions for a range of velocities by ray tracing both the cylindrical cloak @xcite and the invisible sphere @xcite . we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .     and the the light spatial wave vector @xmath1 share the same direction along the @xmath2-axis in the laboratory frame .",
    "however , the same deterioration in cloaking would occur even if the cloak were traveling in the opposite direction . ]",
    "to illustrate the fresnel - fizeau drag @xcite of light passing through a cloaking device , we consider a cloak moving with speed @xmath3 in the positive @xmath2-direction relative to the coordinate frame of laboratory observer @xmath4 .",
    "initialize the system in frame @xmath4 , where light rays are emitted from the points @xmath5 and propagate with wave vector @xmath6 until they are detected at some later event on the imaging or detection plane @xmath7 .",
    "we therefore imagine shining a light source at the surface @xmath7 and ask how the image on the plane is shifted or distorted as a cloak passes by , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : movingcloak ] .",
    "these rays are to be understood as the geometric optics limit description of the path traversed by a wavefront . in broadband systems , such as vacuum or inside the amplitude cloak",
    ", we may also think of the ray as the trajectory of a spatially confined multifrequency pulse of light , such as a laser pulse .",
    "our analysis makes no assumption on the direction of light propagation nor on the details of the cloak geometry or construction , but we assume that the combination of wave four - vector and cloak motion satisfies the conditions elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite to ensure that the frequency in the cloak frame falls within the cloak s operational bandwidth .",
    "in particular , if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the wave four - vector of incident light and four - velocity of the cloak , relative to the laboratory frame , then the frequency @xmath10 measured in the cloak frame must lie within the operational bandwidth of the cloak @xmath11 $ ] @xmath12 for a given source frequency and operational bandwidth one may always find wave vectors such that this is true , by satisfying the condition @xmath13 in the ray tracing simulations of sec .

    "let light propagate with wave four - vector @xmath6 . in vacuum ,",
    "the tangent four - vector @xcite of the associated ray is @xmath15 where @xmath16 measures the affine time of the ray rather than the coordinate time of an observer ( as defined here , the affine time is a dimensionless parametrization of the curve ) , @xmath17 is the minkowski metric of flat spacetime , and the condition @xmath18 gives a relationship between the frequency @xmath14 and spatial wave vector @xmath1 .",
    "the location of the wavefront after a duration of affine time @xmath19 is subsequently found by integrating the tangent four - vector @xmath20    consider now an observer @xmath21 moving with speed @xmath3 in the positive @xmath2-direction of the laboratory frame , and let the origins of @xmath4 and @xmath21 momentarily coincide .",
    "lorentz transforming the tangent vector from @xmath4 to @xmath21 we find the position of the pulse after affine time @xmath19 as measured by @xmath21 is related to the position measured by @xmath4 through the standard lorentz transformation @xmath22 as expected @xcite : @xmath23    keeping in mind the goal of analyzing the outcome when a cloaking device moves through the scene , let us break up the duration of affine time into three parts @xmath24 corresponding to the duration of affine time @xmath25 required for the pulse to get from the emission point to the point where it would enter the cloak ; the affine time @xmath26 required for the pulse to traverse the region that will become occupied by the cloak ; and the affine time @xmath27 required for the pulse to traverse the final distance from where it would exit the cloak to the imaging plane , as depicted in fig .",

    "( dashed line ) .",
    "the image of the cloaked ray on imaging plane @xmath28 is shifted in time relative to the uncloaked ray ( dotted line ) .",
    "this time delay manifests as a combined time delay and spatial shift in any other inertial frame . ]",
    "now consider a cloaking device passing through the laboratory setup .",
    "the defining characteristic of a cloaking device is that the outgoing ray continues in the same spatial direction as the ingoing ray , so the outgoing tangent four - vector is identical to the ingoing tangent four - vector .",
    "thus by the fundamental theorem of calculus we may ignore the detailed behavior of the integrated tangent four - vector through the cloak and replace it with the integrated behavior of an average tangent four - vector @xmath29 , thereby connecting the entry and exit events with a straight line representing the average behavior of the ray inside the cloak , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 + 1cloak ] .",
    "relative to the entry point , the spacetime event of the exit point is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the amount of affine time required for the light to traverse the cloak .    integrating the tangent four - vector in the cloak frame from the point of emission , through the cloak , to the imaging plane , the new imaging event is @xmath32 the imaging event as described in the laboratory frame is obtained with the lorentz transformation @xmath33    thus the imaging event of the cloaked ray may differ from the imaging event of the uncloaked ray , and if it differs in one frame it will differ in all frames . if the cloak behaves as an amplitude cloak in its rest frame then",
    "@xmath34 is simply a time delay , but since the lorentz transformation mixes time intervals with space intervals , the laboratory observer will measure a spatial shift unless @xmath35 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : comovingdetection ] ) we see that the condition @xmath36 can be satisfied if and only if @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in other words , the average tangent four - vector through the cloak",
    "must be the same as vacuum , and the time it takes for light to pass through the cloak is the same as that of an uncloaked ray , which is the condition for perfect cloaking .",
    "thus we see that the only way to have no image shift or distortion in both the cloak frame and the laboratory frame is if the cloak is perfect . for all purposes the detector can not differentiate between a wavefront passing through a perfect cloak and a wavefront passing through vacuum .",
    "an amplitude cloak preserves the amplitude and spatial direction of throughgoing rays in the cloak frame , but introduces a phase or time delay relative to uncloaked rays traversing the same region . in this case",
    "the average tangent four - vector is actually time - like ; the light pulse travels through the cloak slower than an uncloaked pulse , and the duration of affine time required to traverse the cloak is longer than that of an uncloaked pulse , @xmath39 .    inside impedance - matched dielectric media ,",
    "the tangent four - vector is no longer related to the wave four - vector by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacuumtangent ] ) . instead ,",
    "in the rest frame of the cloak we may relate the average tangent and wave four - vectors by an effective optical metric @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the amplitude cloak s effective index of refraction along the ray as determined by an observer in @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that the affine time required to cross the cloak is @xmath42 and that @xmath43 from which it follows that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spatial length of the ray transect through the cloak .",
    "more specifically , @xmath46 is the coordinate time in the cloak frame that would be required for light to transit a comparable vacuum region , and for a ray transect of spatial length @xmath45 , then @xmath47 .",
    "what this result says is that in the cloak frame the ray arrives to the same spatial coordinate point but with a time delay @xmath48 , which agrees with our expectation for the operation of an amplitude cloak in its rest frame .",
    "however , since the cloak is moving with respect to the laboratory frame , a late arrival to a spatial coordinate point in the cloak frame corresponds to a spatial offset in the laboratory frame in addition to a late arrival .",
    "indeed , boosting to the laboratory frame we find that the detection event has been fresnel - fizeau dragged to @xmath49 where the displacement is @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "what we find therefore is that in the rest frame of the amplitude cloak , a throughgoing ray ultimately reaches the same spatial coordinate point as an uncloaked ray , albeit at a later time .",
    "but when the cloak is in relative motion , the ray is fresnel - fizeau dragged to a different spatial coordinate point compared to an uncloaked ray , and the displacement depends on the amplitude cloak s effective index of refraction , its speed , and the proper spatial transit length of the ray through the cloak .",
    "therefore , in any frame but the rest frame of the cloak , image distortions due to fresnel - fizeau drag will betray the presence of the cloak .    furthermore , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lorentztransformeddisplacement ] ) that for the displacement to be zero in any frame it must be zero in all frames , and that the displacement will be zero if and only if the effective index of refraction along the ray transect is @xmath52 . in other words",
    "that the cloak is effectively vacuum , which is only true for the single - frequency perfect cloak .      for single - frequency perfect cloaks , an infinite number of special combinations of wave four - vector , cloak four - velocity , and cloak operational frequency satisfying eq",
    "( [ eq : dispersioncondition ] ) exist @xcite , but this is not possible for an amplitude cloak .",
    "suppose we want to fine tune a moving device such that it functions as an amplitude cloak according to the laboratory observer @xmath4 .",
    "by the definition of an amplitude cloak , a cloaked light pulse in @xmath4 should reach the detection event @xmath53 where now @xmath54 is merely a time delay proportional to the transect length @xmath55 and effective index of refraction @xmath56 along the transect as measured by @xmath4 .",
    "lorentz transforming to frame @xmath21 comoving with the cloak we now find @xmath57 where @xmath58 now has a spatial displacement in addition to just a time delay , meaning the ray does not end up at the same spatial point as would an uncloaked ray in this frame .",
    "such a device , that deflects throughgoing rays to compensate for the relative motion , could surely be built but would not be interpreted as a cloak in the device rest frame because its presence would be exposed by the distortions introduced by such deflections .",
    "furthermore , lorentz transforming again to any third inertial frame @xmath59 would clearly not recover the cloak functionality , and we conclude that amplitude cloaking is possible in only one choice of inertial frame and that the cloak must be tailored specifically for the choice of inertial frame and relative cloak motion .",
    "there does exist one exception .",
    "when the light rays and cloak velocity are colinear it is clear that the spatial shift is in the same direction as the light propagation and therefore manifests as only a time delay on the imaging plane .",
    "of course it is possible to select different , more complicated imaging planes and directions of cloak motion .",
    "such choices will obviously change some details of the calculated shift , but the generic feature of an image shift emerges for all non - colinear combinations of light ray and cloak velocity .",
    "we now numerically illustrate the effect of fresnel - fizeau drag on invisibility using the invisible sphere @xcite as an example , while also simulating the moving free - space single - frequency perfect cylindrical cloak @xcite for comparison . in this section",
    ", we shall drop the prime notation , even though we are in the cloak frame , for the sake of brevity and notational convenience . for light at its operational frequency ,",

    "the ray tracing of this cloak is implemented following the hamiltonian formulation of light propagation @xcite where one integrates hamilton s equations taking @xmath64 as the hamiltonian of light .",
    "the invisible sphere is not a cloak , but the concept is still the same , as our formalism is general for any kind of invisibility device .",

    "this device is very dispersive , and therefore has a very narrow bandwidth .",
    "however , once light is tuned in its direction of propagation and frequency such that eq .   is satisfied , the invisible sphere behaves similarly to an amplitude cloak for the incident light , preserving its amplitude but not its phase . for the ray tracing of the invisible sphere , we use the newtonian formulation of light propagation in isotropic inhomogeneous media @xcite according to the equation of motion    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the ray velocity in the medium .",

    "however , the full - spectrum perfect cloak violates causality and is therefore physically unrealizable . single - frequency perfect cloaks and amplitude cloaks are two causality - respecting methods to physically realize an invisibility device .",
    "a single - frequency perfect cloak preserves both amplitude and phase of a ray by allowing superluminal ray velocity of a single frequency at the expense of heavy dispersion , while an amplitude cloak can allow finite broadband operation by preserving only the amplitude of light and not its phase , at the expense of a time delay for light propagation through the cloak relative to an uncloaked ray .",
    "it has been previously shown that the functionality of a single - frequency perfect cloak may be compromised by the relativistic doppler effect , but that the cloaking effect holds for all inertial observers for an infinite number of special combinations of wave four - vector and cloak four - velocity such that the doppler - shifted frequency coincides with the cloak s operational frequency . however , even for these special rays the single - frequency perfect cloak is fundamentally non - reciprocal in the sense that a special ray undergoing retroreflection after passing through the cloak will no longer satisfy the necessary condition and will be scattered instead @xcite .    for a finite - bandwidth amplitude cloak , we have now demonstrated that even if the incident wave four - vector and cloak four - velocity satisfy the condition found for single - frequency perfect cloaks , unavoidable image distortions emerge for all but a single choice of inertial observer .",
    "these image distortions are caused by another aspect of special relativity : fresnel - fizeau drag by the cloak introduces a spatial offset of throughgoing rays .",
    "it should be noted that the cause of this shift is completely unrelated to the kind of spatial offsets that result from additional structures , such as impedance - matching layers , that are sometimes imposed during the construction of cloaks @xcite .",
    "as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : cc_blue ] , [ fig : cc_red ] , [ fig : is_blue ] , and [ fig : is_red ] , the magnitude of the image distortion grows with relative velocity and only becomes pronounced at about 10% of the speed of light .",
    "but in principle the presence of an amplitude invisibility device is exposed at any relative velocity and would be detectable with sufficiently sensitive detectors .",
    "it is fascinating that these kinds of relativistic effects can have a potentially strong impact on the functionality of cloaks and invisibility devices , and while small , it is possible that such effects may need to be accounted for in high - precision applications , even those beyond the domain of invisibility .    finally , we can state that light cloaked in one inertial frame can be cloaked in any other inertial frame if and only if the cloaking device is a single - frequency perfect cloak as perceived by this light , which in turn means that the amplitude and phase of this light is preserved by the cloaking device in all inertial frames .",
    "as discussed , such a cloaking device would have to be single - frequency in order to not violate causality .",
