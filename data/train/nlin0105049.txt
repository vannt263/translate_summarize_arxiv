    "we consider only symmetric spatial response functions that are positive definite and ( without loss of generality ) obey the normalization condition @xmath6 thus we exclude asymmetric effects , such as those generated by asymmetric temporal response functions ( with @xmath2 being time ) , as in the case of the raman effect on optical pulses @xcite",

    "nonlocality also accompanies the propagation of waves in plasma @xcite , and a nonlocal response in the form ( [ generalnls ] ) appears naturally as a result of many body interaction processes in the description of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",

    "we assume that @xmath136 @xmath137 for @xmath138 where @xmath102 is the number of mi bands .",

    "the bifurcation equation ( [ bifurcational condition1 ] ) reads @xmath149 in this case , and by means of ( [ critical value ] ) with @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) , we find the critical values @xmath152 moreover , one finds that @xmath153 , from which it follows that new mi bands are excited at the bifurcation points .",

    "the expression ( [ velocity1 ] ) ( with @xmath133 replaced with @xmath156 , @xmath157 and ( [ a])-([c ] ) show that the higher order mi gain bands move towards lower wavenumbers as the width @xmath46 increases .",

    "the function @xmath71 given by @xmath158 in the defocusing case . here",
    "the number of zeros of @xmath71 , denoted by @xmath99 , is _ even _ , i.e. @xmath159 @xmath160 and there are @xmath102 mi bands .",

    "a typical situation revealing stability occurs when @xmath164 for all @xmath165 , irrespective of the value of @xmath46 .",
    "the spectrum of the gaussian ( [ gaussf ] ) satisfies this property .",
    "the same holds true for the exponential response function @xmath166 for which the fourier - transform is given by @xmath167    when @xmath168 changes sign , the picture is somewhat more complicated .",
    "first of all , we will still have stability if @xmath169 for all @xmath29 provided the control parameter @xmath15 is below certain threshold @xmath170 . the threshold value @xmath170 and the corresponding value of @xmath29",
    "can be found by requiring the bifurcation condition ( [ bifurcational condition ] ) to be fulfilled .",
    "secondly , if @xmath15 belongs to the complementary regime , i.e. , @xmath171 we have @xmath172 for certain wavenumber intervals , and hence we may have one or more mi gain bands , whose growth rate @xmath173 is given by ( [ normalized growth rate ] ) and ( [ defocusingphi ] ) .",
    "even in this case one can prove the existence of a unique maximum growth rate within each unstable band in the same way as in the focusing case .",
    "again we use the square pulse function ( [ square pulse ] ) - ( [ square pulsef ] ) as an example .",
    "the bifurcation problem is solved by means of ( [ bifurcationalsq ] ) - ( [ critical value ] ) with @xmath174 and hence the extra constraint that @xmath175 here we also find that @xmath176 , which means that new mi bands are excited through the bifurcation process . the table below displays the bifurcation values of @xmath15 for the lowest order excitations .",
    "@xmath177    the number of mi bands increases when the width increases . by ( [ generic condition ] ) each mi band has a maximum growth rate . finally , by using the expression for the velocity of the zeros @xmath178 and @xmath179 of @xmath71 @xmath180 in the defocusing case @xmath181 and ( [ a ] ) - ( [ c ] ) with @xmath71 given as ( [ defocusingphi ] ) and @xmath182 and @xmath183replaced with @xmath178and @xmath184respectively",
    ", it can be shown in a the same way as in the focusing case that @xmath185 and hence the mi bands move to the low wavenumber regimes as the width increases .",
    "the latter analytical result is also in accordance with the numerical results obtained in @xcite . in fig.3 .",
    "the mi result for the square pulse ( [ square pulse ] ) in the defocusing case is displayed .",
    "now , let us consider a localized response function @xmath7 which can be written as a convex combination of @xmath99 response functions @xmath186 whose properties are known i.e. the weighted mean @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 is parametrized by a typical lengthscale @xmath190 , i.e. @xmath191 with @xmath192 as the scaling functions . from now on we refer to the functions @xmath189 as  building blocks  .",

    "to summarize , the stability properties depend on the weight @xmath214 of each fourier - transform @xmath195 and length scale @xmath203 .",
    "let us consider some special cases .",
    "assume that the fourier transforms @xmath215 of all the building block functions @xmath216 are monotonically decreasing positive functions , such as the exponential and gaussian response functions .",
    "the sum @xmath217 will now be a decreasing and positive function of @xmath29 . in the defocusing case",
    "@xmath4 we will have modulational stability in this case , while we get mi with one gain band about @xmath218 in the focusing case ( @xmath9=1 ) , which has a unique maximum growth rate . in fig .  4 .",
    "we display this phenomenon for the case when the total response function is a sum of a gaussian and an exponential response function .    in fig .",
    "5 we show what happens for a focusing nonlinearity when the response function is a 3-component combination of a gaussian , an exponential , and a square response function . in fig .",
    "5 two mi gain bands are revealed .",
    "a typical feature of the fundamental band is that the growth rate exhibits a more complex behavior with several local extrema , as opposed to the single - maximum generic situation defined by ( [ generic condition ] ) .",
    "the linear stage of the mi for the nonlocal nls equation is conveniently studied in terms of the spectrum of the response function . from the dispersion relation ( [ generaleigenvalue ] ) it appears that the crucial point in this discussion is the location of the spectrum of the response function relative to the parabola in @xmath29-space .",
    "the following features complement and extend the results obtained in @xcite :    * the mi is of the finite bandwidth type .",
    "it consists of a finite number of well - separated gain bands .",

    "this property holds true for the gaussian , the exponential and the square response functions .",
    "it resembles the structure of the mi bands in the focusing local nls equation . * in the focusing case we always find at least one mi gain band centered about @xmath218 .",
    "it is verified analytically that the width of this mi band , as well as the corresponding growth rate , decreases when increasing the width of the response function , provided the spectrum of the response function is decreasing in this mi band .",
    "furthermore , additional mi bands are excited at higher wavenumbers when the width parameter exceeds a certain threshold , i.e. when the nonlinearity becomes sufficiently nonlocal .",
    "the latter phenomenon is a unique feature of the nonlocal nonlinearity and has no equivalent in the local case and the weakly nonlocal limit .",
    "* in the defocusing case we can either have stability or mi of the finite bandwidth type .",
    "the latter situation can only occur in the high wavenumber regime , and only if the width of the response function exceeds a certain threshold , i.e. when the nonlinearity becomes sufficiently nonlocal .",

    "it is possible to study mi for more complicated multiscale scenarios where the response functions decompose into a weighted mean of  building blocks  , where each  building block  has a characterized width . in this case",
