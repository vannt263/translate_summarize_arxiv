    "a basic problem for a given shimura variety is to define a reasonable model for the variety over the ring of integers of its reflex field . in @xcite ,",
    "rapoport and zink define natural models for certain pel shimura varieties with parahoric level structure at @xmath0 over the ring of integers in the completion of the reflex field at any place dividing @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , they reduce many aspects of the study of these models to the associated _ local models ; _ these give tale - local neighborhoods of the rapoport - zink models which are defined in terms of purely linear - algebraic moduli problems , and thus  at least in principle  are more amenable to direct investigation .",
    "there has been much study of local models in various cases since the appearance of rapoport and zink s book ; see , for example , work of pappas @xcite , grtz @xcite , haines and ng @xcite , pappas and rapoport @xcite , krmer @xcite , arzdorf @xcite , and the author @xcite . beginning with pappas s paper @xcite , it has come to be understood that when the group defining the shimura variety is _ ramified _ at @xmath0  that is , the base change of the group to @xmath1 splits only after passing to a ramified extension of @xmath1  then the associated model and local model need not satisfy one of the most basic criteria for reasonableness , namely they need not be flat .",
    "in such cases , the models and local models defined by rapoport and zink have come to be renamed _ naive _ models and local models , respectively , with the true models and local models defined as the scheme - theoretic closures of the generic fibers in the respective naive models and local models .",
    "sparked by pappas s observation , it has become an important part of the subject to better understand local models in the presence of ramification ; see @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is an interesting problem to obtain a _ moduli - theoretic description _ of the local model in such cases , ideally by refining the moduli problem that describes the naive local model .",
    "this is the problem of concern in this paper and its sequel @xcite , in one of the basic cases in which ramification arises : a unitary similitude group attached to an imaginary quadratic number field ramified at @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath5 be a ramified quadratic extension of discretely valued , non - archimedean fields of residual characteristic not @xmath6 .",
    "endow @xmath7 , @xmath8 , with the @xmath5-hermitian form @xmath9 specified by the values @xmath10 on the standard basis vectors @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and consider the reductive group @xmath13 over @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we consider exclusively the case that @xmath3 is odd ; the case of even @xmath3 will be treated in @xcite . in the odd case , every parahoric subgroup of @xmath15 can be described as the stabilizer of a self - dual periodic lattice chain in @xmath7 , and the conjugacy classes of parahoric subgroups can be naturally parametrized by the nonempty subsets of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ; see or , for more details , @xcite*1.2.3(a ) .",
    "identifying @xmath18 , let @xmath19 denote the cocharacter @xmath20 of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the standard maximal torus of diagonal matrices in @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are nonnegative integers with @xmath26 .",
    "in the special case that @xmath27 and @xmath28 is isomorphic to the @xmath1-localization of a hermitian space @xmath29 with @xmath30 an imaginary quadratic number field , the pair @xmath31 denotes the signature of @xmath29 and @xmath19 is a cocharacter obtained in the usual way from the shimura datum attached to the associated unitary similitude group , as in @xcite .    for nonempty @xmath32",
    ", we may then consider the _ naive local model @xmath33 _ in the sense of @xcite ; this is a projective @xmath34-scheme whose explicit definition we recall in [ ss : naive_lm ] .",
    "as @xcite observes , the naive local model fails to be flat over @xmath34 in general . in response ,",
    "the papers @xcite attempt to correct for non - flatness by adding new conditions to the moduli problem defining @xmath33 : first pappas adds the _ wedge condition _ to define a closed subscheme @xmath35 , the _ wedge local model _ ( see [ ss : wedge_cond ] ) ; and then pappas and rapoport add a further condition , the _ spin condition _ , to define a third closed subscheme @xmath36 , the _ spin local model _ ( see [ ss : spin_cond ] ) .",
    "the schemes @xmath33 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the honest local model @xmath39 all have common generic fiber , and pappas and rapoport conjecture the following .",
    "@xmath38 coincides with the local model @xmath39 inside @xmath33 ; or in other words , @xmath38 is flat over @xmath34 .",
    "although the conjecture remains open in general , pappas and rapoport have obtained a good deal of computer evidence in support of it .",
    "the main result of this paper is essentially a preliminary form of the conjecture , which we state precisely as follows .    the schemes @xmath38 and @xmath37 are topologically flat over @xmath34 ; or in other words , the underlying topological spaces of @xmath38 , @xmath37 , and @xmath39 coincide",
    "see and ; recall that a scheme over a regular , integral , @xmath40-dimensional base scheme is _ topologically flat _ if its generic fiber is dense .",
    "the theorem notwithstanding , the scheme structures on @xmath37 and @xmath38 really can differ , and it is only @xmath38 that is conjectured to be flat in general ; see @xcite*7.4(iv ) .",
    "we shall show in @xcite that the spin local models @xmath38 attached to _ even _ ramified unitary groups are also topologically flat ; here the schemes @xmath37 and @xmath38 usually do not even agree set - theoretically .",
    "following grtz @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the key technique in the proof of the main theorem is to embed the special fiber of @xmath33 in an appropriate affine flag variety , where it and the special fibers of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 become stratified into finitely many schubert cells .",
    "pappas and rapoport show that the main theorem follows from showing that the schubert cells in the special fibers of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are indexed by the _",
    "@xmath19-admissible set ; _ see [ ss : top_flat ] .",
    "we solve this problem by translating it into an equivalent one for @xmath41 , which in turn boils down to obtaining a concrete description of the admissible set for the cocharacter @xmath42 of @xmath41 .",
    "here we make key use of a result of haines and ng @xcite that describes admissible sets for @xmath41 in terms of _ permissible _ sets for @xmath43 . as a byproduct of our considerations ,",
    "we show that the notions of @xmath42-admissibility and @xmath42-permissibility for @xmath41 are equivalent .",
    "finally , we remark that failure of flatness of the models in @xcite is not a phenomenon related solely to ramification : as observed by genestier , the local models in @xcite attached to split even orthogonal groups also fail to be flat in general .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we now outline the contents of the paper .",
    "sections [ s : loc_mod][s : afv ] consist almost entirely of review from @xcite : in [ s : loc_mod ] we review the definitions of the various local models , in [ s : gu ] we review some group - theoretic aspects of ramified @xmath2 , and in [ s : afv ] we review the embedding of the special fiber of the local model into an appropriate affine flag variety attached to @xmath2 . in [ s : schub_cells ] we obtain combinatorial descriptions of the schubert cells contained in the special fibers of @xmath44 and @xmath45 inside the affine flag variety , and we reduce the main theorem to showing that these cells are indexed by the @xmath19-admissible set . in [ s : combinatorics ] we solve this last problem , as described above .",
