    "nearly four years have elapsed since the start of the fukushima dai - ichi nuclear power plant accident  @xcite , which began in march , 2011 .",
    "because of the large amounts of radionuclides deposited on soil and water in fukushima prefecture and surrounding regions of japan , the risk of serious internal radiation exposure for residents was of great concern initially , but most data accumulated and disseminated so far have consistently shown that the internal contamination for the overwhelming majority of residents has fortunately been so low as to be undetectable  @xcite .",
    "the data include , for example , whole - body - counter surveys  @xcite , duplicate - diet studies  @xcite , the inspection of `` all rice in all rice bags '' harvested in fukushima ( 2012 - 2014 )  @xcite .     a map of the air dose rate ( @xmath4sv / h ) estimated from airborne monitoring , as of november 19 , 2013  @xcite .",

    "the locations of the fukushima dai - ichi nuclear power plant ( fdnpp ) , the town of miharu , fukushima city , koriyama city , and hirata central hospital ( hirata ch ) are indicated.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this does not mean that the lives of fukushima residents have returned to normal , however . a survey conducted by fukushima city in may , 2013",
    ", @xcite indicated that about 80% of fukushima city residents are still concerned about the risk of internal radiation exposures from food .",
    "another study showed that about three quarters of the parents of minamisoma school children buy only non - fukushima produced foodstuffs at the grocery store , out of fear of radioactive contamination  @xcite .    in this regard ,",
    "the results of the whole - body - counter surveys of miharu - town school children , conducted for four consecutive years ( 20112014 ) with high ( @xmath5 ) coverage provide valuable sampling - bias - free information , are worth reporting , particularly because the majority of the children are regularly consuming local / home - grown foodstuffs , as will be shown later .",
    "the town of miharu ( population @xmath6 ) , located about 50  km west of fukushima dai - ichi , is in the suburbs of koriyama city ( population @xmath7 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , the soil contamination level , inferred from the airborne radiation monitoring results ( november 2013 ) is moderate in the southern part of the town , and is slightly higher in the northern part .",
    "the percentage of agricultural households is about 20% .",
    "there are six municipally - operated primary schools , attended by approximately 800 children in all , and two secondary schools , with about 500 children in total . in the fall of 2011 ,",
    "the miharu - town school board decided to have all the school children tested for internal radiation exposures .",
    "this was continued in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 .",
    "the results of the 2011 - 2013 internal - contamination surveys have been reported in ref .",
    "although the results of the questionnaires of 2012 - 2013 indicated that approximately 60% of the children had been regularly eating local or home - grown rice , in 2012 and 2013 no child was found to exceed the @xmath3cs detection limit of 300 bq / body .",
    "this present paper reports the results of the 2014 internal - contamination surveys , in which we used a newly - developed whole - body counter called babyscan  @xcite , having a detection limit of @xmath1  bq / body , for children with a height of less than 130  cm .",
    "the study was endorsed by the miharu - town school board , and was approved by the ethics committee of the university of tokyo .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     as shown , about 75  % of miharu families drink tap and well water , 80  % eat fukushima rice , and 75  % eat fukushima vegetables ( some 10% regularly eat home - grown or local vegetables that have not been tested for radioactivity ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation in the city of minamisoma , where about 3/4 of families answered that they avoid local / fukushima produce  @xcite .",
    "the current study supports previous ones which have suggested that the risk of significant internal radiation exposures among the population of fukushima remains small , even among people who consistently eat locally - grown produce .",
    "figure [ fig : waterricevegetable ] shows that about 20% of the families buy bottled water , and about 15% avoid fukushima produce , which appears to suggest that the choice of bottled water and avoidance of fukushima produce may be correlated .    in order to confirm this",
    ", we performed a correspondence analysis  @xcite using a standard mathematical procedure of row principal scoring  @xcite , the result of which is graphically displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottledwater ] .",
    "black circles are for the choice of drinking water and red circles are for the choice of rice and vegetables . in this graph ,",
    "the area of the red circles are proportional to the entries in the last row of table  [ tab : cross ] .",
    "the solid line drawn through the `` bottle '' circle represent the principal axes for those who buy bottled water , and the intersection of the dotted lines drawn perpendicular to the solid line indicate the relative `` distance '' of the choice of rice / vegetable to the choice of bottled water .",
    "as shown , those who buy bottled water tend to avoid fukushima rice / vegetables .",
    "in conclusion , comprehensive whole - body counter surveys of miharu town school children have been conducted for four consecutive years , in 20112014 .",
    "this represents the only long - term , sampling - bias - free internal contamination study conducted after the fukushima dai - ichi accident . for the first time , in 2014 , the babyscan , which has a low @xmath0cs mda of @xmath1  bq / body , was used to screen children shorter than 130  cm .",
    "no child in this group was found to have detectable level of radiocesium . using the mdas ,",
    "the upper limits of daily intake of radiocesium were estimated for each child .",
    "for those screened with the babyscan , the upper limits were found to be @xmath2  bq / day for @xmath3cs , which is consistent with the results of other studies , such as the duplicate diet study conducted by co - op fukushima  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the questionnaire filled out by the parents of the children regarding their families food and water consumption revealed that the majority of miharu children regularly consume local or home - grown rice and vegetables .",
    "this has not resulted in an increased body burden , however , compared to children who consume only non - fukushima food .",
    "this however does not increase the body burden .",
    "correspondence analysis of the questionnaire results indicated that families which buy bottled water also tend to avoid fukushima produce .",
    "differences in risk perception clearly exist among populations living in different parts of fukushima .",
    "similar correspondence analysis conducted for different fukushima communities may provide useful information for clarifying concerns related to food and other perceived risks , and planning appropriate interventions .",
