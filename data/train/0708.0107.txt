    "the presence of primordial magnetic fields in the early stages of the evolution of the universe has been discussed by several authors ( misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite ; asseo and sol @xcite ; pudritz and silk @xcite ; kim , tribble , and kronberg @xcite ; perley and taylor @xcite ; kronberg , perry and zukowski @xcite ; wolfe , lanzetta and oren @xcite ; kulsrud , cen , ostriker and ryu @xcite ; barrow @xcite ) .",
    "melvin @xcite , in his cosmological solution for dust and electromagnetic field suggested that during the evolution of the universe , the matter was in a highly ionized state and was smoothly coupled with the field , subsequently forming neutral matter as a result of universe expansion .",

    "there are significant observational evidence for the detection of einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath0 or a component of material content of the universe that varies slowly with time and space to act like @xmath0 .",
    "a wide range of observations now compellingly suggest that the universe possesses a non - zero cosmological term @xcite . in the context of quantum field theory",
    ", a cosmological term corresponds to the energy density of vacuum .",
    "the birth of the universe has been attributed to an excited vacuum fluctuation triggering off an inflationary expansion followed by the super - cooling .",
    "the release of locked up vacuum energy results in subsequent reheating .",
    "the cosmological term , which is measure of the energy of empty space , provides a repulsive force opposing the gravitational pull between the galaxies . if the cosmological term exists , the energy it represents counts as mass because mass and energy are equivalent .",
    "if the cosmological term is large enough , its energy plus the matter in the universe could lead to inflation . unlike standard inflation",
    ", a universe with a cosmological term would expand faster with time because of the push from the cosmological term @xcite .",
    "some of the recent discussions on the cosmological constant `` problem '' and on cosmology with a time - varying cosmological constant by ratra and peebles @xcite , dolgov @xcite and sahni and starobinsky @xcite point out that in the absence of any interaction with matter or radiation , the cosmological constant remains a `` constant '' .",
    "however , in the presence of interactions with matter or radiation , a solution of einstein equations and the assumed equation of covariant conservation of stress - energy with a time - varying @xmath0 can be found .",
    "this entails that energy has to be conserved by a decrease in the energy density of the vacuum component followed by a corresponding increase in the energy density of matter or radiation ( see also weinberg @xcite , carroll , press and turner @xcite , peebles @xcite , padmanabhan @xcite and pradhan et al .",
