    "notwithstanding simple underlying physics , percolation transition are _ bona fide _ second order phase transitions , with all of usual the hallmarks of singular behavior at a critical point  @xcite .",
    "percolation transitions , phase transitions mediated by a disordering influence such as the random removal of sites or bonds on a regular lattice geometry , are amenable to numerical study in the context of monte carlo calculations used to treat disorder .",
    "however , while the critical behavior in discrete systems may be characterized to a high level of precision in this manner , there are salient examples of percolation phenomena which can not be reduced to discrete lattices .    in realistic porous media ,",
    "the flow of liquid on a macroscopic basis typically entails the passage of liquid around irregularly shaped granules which comprise the material and represent barriers to fluid flow . for the movement of fluid or charge in porous materials ,",
    "there is a dichotomy for volume concentrations of barrier particles above and below a critical concentration @xmath2 .",
    "if inclusions are sufficiently sparse , voids join together in a macroscopic connected network spanning the entire system , allowing for the transmission of fluid at the bulk level . on the other hand , for large enough concentrations of randomly placed barrier particles ,",
    "contiguous navigable voids are limited in size to a finite length scale @xmath3 , barring the transmission of fluid at a system wide level ; the critical density @xmath2 of inclusions which separates the two scenarios is thus of practical significance .    for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we rescale coordinates in such a way that the spherical inclusions are each of unit radius .",
    "although in principle one may record the critical density @xmath2 where the percolation transition occurs , a more frequent practice in discussing percolation through voids is to report instead the excluded volume  @xcite , given by @xmath4 .",
    "determining if voids may be traversed at the macroscopic level is a continuum percolation problem for which a topologically equivalent discrete counterpart is in general not readily accessible , a condition very distinct from that of a complementary percolation problem ( with the permeability pattern reversed ) where the flux occurs through networks formed of overlapping included particles with interstitial regions impervious to fluid flow .",
    "the geometry of the randomly placed barriers , known _ a priori _ , facilitates the calculation of characteristics related to percolation when the flow is through included particles instead of the interstitial spaces . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the shapes of voids between barrier particles are only evident _ a posteori _ hampers a rigorous identification of networks formed by connected voids and enhances the challenge of finding the percolation threshold . nevertheless , with the aid of a finite size scaling analysis , we determine not only the critical volume fraction @xmath5 , but also the critical exponent @xmath6 associated with the correlation length @xmath3 .",
    "previous theoretical studies include calculations which use an approximate discrete scheme and extrapolate to the continuum case  @xcite . in a related effort",
    ", the discretization scheme has been applied to randomly placed ellipsoids  @xcite and oblate spheroids  @xcite . in particular cases , such as systems comprised of randomly placed spheres , discrete networks equivalent to void spaces  @xcite may be constructed .",
    "voronoi tessellations , and the appropriate generalizations have been applied  @xcite to systems comprised of randomly located spheres . in a recent set of calculations , there is no discretization scheme and the simulation entails following tracer particles in an effectively infinite sized system  @xcite ; the percolation threshold is identified by determining the density of spheres for which the tracers cease to move diffusively . in this work , we use a dynamical approach where systems of finite size are examined . in this way",
    ", we are able to apply standard machinery of finite size scaling analysis while providing rigorous treatment to the geometric intricacies of voids between barriers which serve as conduits for fluid or charge in the percolative regime .",
    "an order parameter , an intensive thermodynamic variable finite when the phase is intact , and decreasing continuously to zero at a phase boundary ( e.g. magnetization per unit volume in the case of ferromagnetism disrupted by thermal fluctuations above the curie temperature and nonzero below it ) , may be pressed into service as a tool to locate second order phase transitions and thereby determine the phase diagram . in percolation phenomena where connected navigable clusters are readily identified ,",
    "the `` strength '' of the spanning cluster , or the number of sites in the lattice it encompasses relative to the total number of sites in the system , is conveniently sampled in monte carlo simulations using techniques such as the hoshen - kopelman algorithm for the identification and characterization of connected clusters  @xcite .    in the scenario of interest , where percolation occurs through",
    "irregularly shaped interstices among randomly placed barrier particles of a prescribed shape , the connectivity of void volumes to adjacent navigable regions may be difficult to establish in more general situations ( e.g. non - spherical inclusions such as tetrahedra , cubes , or octahedra ) . to address this challenge",
    ", we use dynamical simulations to probe and determine the extent of voids .",
    "although stochastically driven exploration is validated in the case of randomly placed spheres , the approach may be used in scenarios where variants of voronoi tessellation are more difficult to apply .    in the spirit of a _ gedanken _ experiment ,",
    "we envision applying a reflective coating to exposed surfaces of overlapping spheres such that light striking the included particles is reflected with no penetration of the incident rays .",
    "whereas the transmission of light through the matrix of inclusions would signal that the system would admit the flow of fluid or electrical charge , a configuration which blocks the transmission of incident light also lacks a percolating path .",
    "dynamical trajectories are initiated with an unbiased choice for the point of origin in the interior of a void and exterior to all barrier particles . to select a void point ,",
    "randomly chosen candidate locations are accepted only if the point is exterior to all neighboring spheres .",
    "some economy is gained in partitioning the 3d system into a cubic grid , where the unit cell size is slightly greater than the radius @xmath7 of the spheres .",
    "the subdivisions reduce the task of checking for penetration into nearby spheres to simply checking the cubic unit cell occupied by the prospective ( randomly chosen ) starting point as well as each of the adjacent cubes . to set the virtual ray in motion , a `` velocity '' vector @xmath8 is randomly chosen in a spherically symmetric way to eliminate any directional bias , with @xmath8 of unit length since `` speed ''",
    "has no physical or computational significance in the context of the order parameter calculation .",
    "the ray trajectory is @xmath9 with the starting point @xmath10 and the orientation of the velocity vector @xmath8 stochastically determined .",
    "the path of the ray must be traced until contact is made with the nearest sphere ; with a barrier particle centered at @xmath11 , the condition for intersection with a sphere of radius @xmath7 is @xmath12 .",
    "standard geometric arguments lead to @xmath13 for the distance to a point of intersection , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 . choosing the negative sign corresponds to the closer point of entry and the positive sign to the more distant point of departure as the ray propagates through and exits from the sphere . finding the closest included",
    "particle intersected by the ray is tantamount to minimizing @xmath16 , the shortest distance to a sphere along the trajectory .    to reduce computational overhead ,",
    "the system is subdivided into a cubic grid in the same fashion as used to determine if a randomly chosen point is located in a void ; rays are propagated from one small unit cell to the next until a collision with a barrier particle is recorded . at the site of a collision @xmath17 , to avoid penetration of the impermeable particles comprising the matrix , the direction of motion must change in such a way that the incident ray is projected away from the interior of the barrier particle .",
    "specular reflection is implemented by reversing the component of the velocity in the direction of @xmath18 , the radius vector extending from the sphere center to the site of the collision .",
    "although mirror reflection encapsulates the physics of geometric optics appropriate to a ray of light moving in a matrix of silvered spheres , propagation by simple specular reflection may be improved on , particularly in the case of neck - like voids where many collisions may be required to traverse the narrow corridor if the ray is directed normal to the primary axis of the void . to improve the efficiency of navigation by roughly an order of magnitude , we incorporate moves where , instead of mirror reflection , the ray trajectory shifts by a right angle . in 3d ,",
    "even with a perpendicular shift imposed , there remains a degree of freedom , which is selected at random to provide stochastic input at each collision .",
    "the balance of the moves is such that stochastically infused right angle moves outnumber specular moves two to one .    to interrogate the system and determine whether a void is part of a spanning cluster , we calculate the excursion parameter @xmath19 , structured to allow for the incorporation of statistical information gleaned from traversals along each of the three cartesian axes . in calculating the rms deviations , special consideration",
    "must be given the periodicity of the system .",
    "when the density of randomly placed spheres is high enough to block percolation , where @xmath20 , the scale @xmath3 of contiguous void networks is in most cases small relative to the system size , and accordingly , @xmath21 .    on the other hand , if inclusions are sparse enough that @xmath22 , system wide traversal becomes feasible .",
    "moreover , with periodic boundary conditions imposed the rms deviations along one or more axes could in principle grow without bound as the ray propagates from one replica of the system to the next .",
    "in such situations , the result would be an unrealistically large order parameter , a circumstance which may be remedied by truncating @xmath23 and counterparts along other axes at the system size @xmath24 .",
    "thus , in the extreme case of a system devoid of inclusions , @xmath25 would attain its maximum value of 1 .",
    "the excursion quantity @xmath25 , which saturates at unity in the absence of obstacles and falls to zero at the percolation threshold for bulk systems , serves as an order parameter giving a measure of the size of a randomly selected void . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the configuration averaged @xmath25 also gives the probability that a randomly selected void is a system spanning cavity .    in a diffusive excursion , though the disorder and time averaged vector displacement vanishes , the root mean square distance traveled scales as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of ray interactions ( and concomitant trajectory deflections ) with barrier particles . unless one is precisely at the percolation threshold with rms deviations from the trajectory starting point scaling as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 in the non - diffusive critical regime  @xcite , configuration averaged ray excursions will scale diffusively with the number of sphere interactions , if the system is sufficiently large .",
    "if the void is small in size , a ray which propagates in the cavity will probe its extent relatively quickly , yielding a finite @xmath25 value . on the other hand , with a system spanning void scaling as the system size @xmath24",
    ", the ray traversal time varies as @xmath30 on average .",
    "hence , to avoid a spuriously low result for the percolation threshold @xmath5 , trajectories are propagated with collisions accumulating until @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an integer prefactor . by successively doubling @xmath32 , a saturation point",
    "is eventually found ( i.e. for @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) where statistically significant changes in critical quantities cease to occur .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath25 parameter entails averaging over many realizations of disorder ( i.e. at least @xmath35 ) to suppress statistical fluctuations and permit the observation of finite size scaling trends , which are exploited to calculate critical quantities such as @xmath5 and the correlation length exponent @xmath6 . to generate disorder configurations ,",
    "we sample the grand canonical ensemble as described in the appendix to determine the number of spherical barriers encompassed in the simulation volume .",
    "the mersenne twister algorithm , which generates high quality random numbers with a modest computational cost , is used for stochastic input .",
    "( color online ) the excursion order parameter @xmath25 is plotted with respect to excluded volume @xmath36 for various system sizes ; the inset is a magnified view of the intersection of the @xmath25 curves . ]",
    "percolation transitions , whether in the context of continuum or in discrete cases , are second order transitions with singular behavior in thermodynamic variables at the phase transition .",

    "an important implication is the crossing of @xmath25 curves at @xmath5 for different system sizes , provided the system size is large enough .",
    "similar intersections are seen in the case of the binder cumulant  @xcite at the curie temperature @xmath40 in the context of ferromagnetic transitions , and the crossing phenomena in both the former and the latter represent a robust avenue for locating second order phase transitions .    fig .",

    "although in the thermodynamic limit crossings would occur exactly at @xmath5 , the locations of intersections for finite size systems [ e.g. @xmath46 differ slightly from @xmath5 due to finite size effects , and must be considered pseudocritical points  @xcite .",

    "the result for the correlation length critical exponent @xmath6 is compatible with the critical behavior of discrete 3d counterparts .",
    "to sample realizations of disorder from the appropriate statistical distribution , it is important to generate random configurations of spherical inclusions in an unbiased way ; since we operate in the grand canonical ensemble , the number @xmath59 of spheres in the simulation volume must in general vary from one sample to the next due to statistical fluctuations . the integer value closest to the mean occupancy @xmath60 is a convenient initial choice , and random variations in the number of spheres in the system are taken into consideration with a sequence of stochastically driven attempts either to raise or lower @xmath59 .",
    "the latter are part of an importance sampling scheme similar to that used to derive the metropolis criterion  @xcite at the heart of monte carlo simulations that sample the boltzmann distribution in the calculation of equilibrium thermodynamic variables .    to determine the probability of having @xmath59 spheres in the simulation volume @xmath61",
