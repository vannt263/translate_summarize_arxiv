    "finite - size effects in critical phenomena have been the object of theoretical studies for a long time.@xcite finite - size scaling ( fss ) describes the critical behavior around a critical point , when the correlation length @xmath0 of the critical modes becomes comparable to the size @xmath1 of the system . for large sizes , this regime presents universal features , shared by all systems whose transition belongs to the same universality class . although formulated in the classical framework , fss also holds at zero - temperature quantum transitions,@xcite in which the critical behavior is driven by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the fss approach is one of the most effective techniques for the numerical determination of the critical quantities . while infinite - volume methods require that the condition @xmath2 is satisfied , fss applies to the less demanding regime @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , fss theory provides the asymptotic scaling behavior when both @xmath4 keeping their ratio @xmath5 fixed .",
    "however knowledge of the asymptotic behavior may not be enough to estimate the critical parameters , because data are generally available for limited ranges of parameter values and system sizes , which are often relatively small . under these conditions ,",
    "the asymptotic fss predictions are affected by sizable scaling corrections .",
    "thus , reliably accurate estimates of the critical parameters need a robust control of the corrections to the asymptotic behavior .",
    "this is also important for a conclusive identification of the universality class of the quantum critical behavior when it is _ a priori _ uncertain .",
    "an understanding of the finite - size effects is also relevant for experiments , when relatively small systems are considered , see , e.g. , ref .  , or in particle systems trapped by external ( usually harmonic ) forces , as in recent cold - atom experiments ,",

    "in this paper we study fss at quantum transitions ,  @xcite within the framework of the renormalization - group ( rg ) theory .",
    "we generalize wegner s scaling ansatz  @xcite to quantum systems .",
    "this allows us to characterize the corrections to the asymptotic fss behavior .",
    "we predict nonanalytic scaling corrections due to the irrelevant rg perturbations and analytic contributions which are due to regular backgrounds and to the expansions of the nonlinear scaling fields in terms of the hamiltonian parameters .    to verify the rg predictions , we consider the quantum xy chain in a transverse field , which represents a standard theoretical laboratory for the understanding of quantum transitions .",
    "its hamiltonian can be rewritten as a quadratic hamiltonian of spinless fermions.@xcite using this representation , several quantities can be computed either exactly or very precisely by numerical methods .",
    "this allows us to check the fss predictions for the scaling corrections of several observables .",
    "we consider the free energy , the energy differences between the lowest - energy levels , and the correlation functions of the order parameter , confirming the rg results in all cases .",
    "finally , we discuss the fss behavior of the bipartite entanglement entropies of one - dimensional systems with an isolated critical point with @xmath6 .",
    "we perform a detailed study in the xy model , verifying the presence of further peculiar corrections ,  @xcite beside those associated with the usual bulk and boundary rg irrelevant perturbations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ generalfss ] we discuss the general rg approach to the study of fss at quantum transitions , considering , in particular , the case of isolated quantum critical points between different quantum phases . in sec .",

    "[ entang ] is devoted to a fss analysis of the bipartite entanglement entropy at the quantum transition of the quantum xy chain , focusing again on the nature of the scaling corrections . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we summarize our main results and draw some conclusions .",
    "a few appendices report some formulas which are used in the paper .",
    "in this section we summarize the main rg ideas behind fss , providing the framework to analyze critical finite - size effects in continuous quantum transitions . as their classical counterparts ,",
    "they are characterized by a diverging length scale @xmath0 and show universal scaling properties , which can be analyzed in the framework of rg theory .",
    "guided by the quantum - to - classical mapping , we generalize wegner s scaling ansatz  @xcite to quantum systems , and then use it to predict the type of subleading corrections that are expected in finite systems and/or at finite @xmath7 , close to a continuous transition .",
    "we consider the standard case in which the quantum zero - temperature transition of a @xmath8-dimensional system is characterized by two relevant parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , defined so that they vanish at the critical point .",
    "therefore , the quantum critical point is at @xmath11 we assume the presence of a parity - like @xmath12 symmetry , as it occurs , for instance , in ising or o@xmath13 transitions which separate a paramagnetic phase with @xmath14 from a ferromagnetic phase with @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is coupled to a rg perturbation that is invariant under the symmetry , while @xmath10 is associated with the leading odd perturbation , generally related to the order parameter of the transition . as usual , we express the rg dimensions of the perturbations associated with @xmath9 and @xmath10 in terms of the critical exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dynamic critical exponent associated with time and temperature . at the critical point",
    "the low - energy scales vanish : the gap @xmath20 behaves as @xmath21 at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the length scale @xmath0 associated with the critical modes diverges as @xmath24 at @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and as @xmath25 at @xmath26 and @xmath23 .      under the quantum - to - classical mapping",
    ", the inverse temperature corresponds to the system size in an imaginary time direction .",
    "thus , the temperature scaling at a quantum critical point in @xmath8 dimensions is analogous to fss in a corresponding @xmath27 classical system .",
    "if @xmath6 , which holds for transitions described by 2d conformal field theories ( cfts )  @xcite and for paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transitions in @xmath8-dimensional o(@xmath28 ) symmetric spin systems  @xcite ( ising systems correspond to @xmath29 ) , the quantum transition corresponds to a classical @xmath30-dimensional equilibrium transition , in which @xmath31 plays the role of an additional spatial dimension .",
    "there are also interesting cases in which @xmath32 .",
    "for instance , superfluid - to - vacuum and mott transitions of lattice particle systems described by the hubbard and bose - hubbard models have @xmath33 when driven by the chemical potential.@xcite in this case , the classical system is strongly anisotropic since @xmath34 , @xmath35 under a rg rescaling .",
    "also for this class of transitions , which include many dynamic off - equilibrium transitions,@xcite fss is quite well established .",
    "we can , therefore , extend those results to the quantum case .    according to rg ,",
    "close to a continuous transition the free energy satisfies a general scaling law . extending the classical fss ansatz ,",
    "@xcite we generally write the free - energy density as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a nonuniversal function which is analytic at the critical point , and @xmath38 bears the nonanalyticity of the critical behavior and its universal features . the arguments of @xmath38 are the so - called nonlinear scaling fields . @xcite they are analytic nonlinear functions of the model parameters , which are associated with the eigenoperators that diagonalize the rg flow close to the rg fixed point .",
    "the scaling fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the relevant scaling fields related to the model parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the scaling fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 are also relevant , with rg dimensions @xmath43 respectively , and are associated with the finite spatial size @xmath1 ( @xmath44 ) and with the temperature ( @xmath45 ) .    beside the relevant scaling fields",
    ", we should also consider an infinite number of irrelevant scaling fields with negative rg dimensions . we distinguish them into two families , the bulk scaling fields @xmath46 and the surface scaling fields @xmath47 , with rg dimensions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the first set is the only one that occurs in the infinite - volume limit and whenever there are no boundaries in the system , for instance , for periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "they are responsible for the scaling corrections to the leading critical behavior in the infinite - volume limit . using standard notation , assuming that they are ordered so that @xmath50 in the presence of a surface , an additional set of boundary rg perturbations should be included .",
    "their rg dimensions depend on the type of boundary conditions and , in particular , on the type of surface critical behavior one is considering . as before , we set @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the dimension of the leading boundary operator .    the singular part of the free energy is expected to satisfy the scaling equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is arbitrary . in the fss case it is useful to take @xmath55 , obtaining @xmath56 . \\label{scalsing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an important question concerns the universality of the function @xmath57 .",
    "since scaling fields are arbitrarily normalized , universality holds apart from a normalization of each argument and an overall constant .",
    "therefore , given two different models , if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the corresponding scaling functions , we have @xmath60 where all constants @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , are nonuniversal",
    ".    to go further we must discuss how the nonlinear scaling fields depend on the control parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath1 , and @xmath7 .",
    "first , it is natural to assume that the bulk scaling fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath65 do not depend on the temperature and the size of the system , i.e. they do not mix with @xmath66 and @xmath7 .",
    "this hypothesis is quite natural for systems with short - range interactions . under a rg transformation",
    ", the transformed bulk couplings only depend on the local hamiltonian , hence they are independent of the boundary . taking into account",
    "the assumed @xmath12 symmetry and the even / odd properties of @xmath9/@xmath10 , close to the critical point the relevant scaling fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be generally expanded as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are nonuniversal constants . as for the irrelevant scaling fields",
    ", they are usually nonvanishing at the critical point .",
    "let us now discuss the scaling fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which are associated with the size of the @xmath30 dimensional system .",
    "for classical systems in a box of size @xmath70 with pbc and , more generally , for translation - invariant boundary conditions , it is usually assumed that @xmath71 , exactly .",
    "this assumption , which has been verified in many instances  for instance , in the two - dimensional ising model  and extensively discussed in ref .",
    ", can be justified as follows .",
    "consider a lattice system and a decimation transformation which reduces the number of lattice sites by a factor @xmath72 . in the absence of boundaries and for short - range interactions ,",
    "the new ( translation - invariant ) couplings are only functions of the couplings of the original lattice and are independent of @xmath1 , while @xmath73 .",
    "since the flow of @xmath1 is independent of the flow of the couplings , we expect @xmath74 this condition does not generally hold for non - translation invariant systems .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath41 is an arbitrary function of @xmath66 . for @xmath75 it can be expanded as @xmath76 note",
    "that , if we define an effective size @xmath77 the scaling field becomes @xmath78 hence , by using @xmath79 , all subleading corrections due to @xmath80 are eliminated in _ any _ observable .",
    "of course , this does not imply that @xmath66 corrections are absent in _ any _ observable , as such type of corrections may have other sources ( we will come back to this point in sec .",
    "[ iii.e ] ) .",
    "such an observable - independent shift is often considered in fss studies of systems with boundary conditions that differ from the periodic ones , see , e.g. , refs .  , which also provide some evidence of the presence of @xmath81 , @xmath82 corrections in the scaling field @xmath41 .",
    "let us now consider the thermal scaling field @xmath42 . to clarify the issue ,",
    "let us first assume that @xmath6 , so that the quantum system is equivalent to a classical @xmath30-dimensional system .",
    "the classical system is , however , weakly anisotropic : couplings in the thermal direction differ from those in the spatial one .",
    "moreover , the anisotropy depends on the model parameters . in classical weakly anisotropic systems universality",
    "is obtained only after transforming to an isotropic system by means of a scale transformation , see refs .   and references therein .",

    "more precisely , if @xmath88 is the dispersion relation of the model , which is assumed to be spatially isotropic , we define @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the value of @xmath91 where the energy has an absolute minimum .",
    "relation ( [ utt ] ) is expected to hold also when @xmath32 , although in this case the rescaling factor is not related to the sound velocity .",
    "the scaling variables @xmath92 and @xmath93 , corresponding to the irrelevant scaling fields , vanish for @xmath75 since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are negative .",
    "thus , provided that @xmath38 is finite and nonvanishing in this limit , we can expand the singular part of the free energy as @xmath94 where we retain only the contributions of the dominant ( least ) irrelevant bulk and surface scaling fields , of rg dimensions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "note that the expansion ( [ fsing - rg ] ) is only possible below the upper critical dimension.@xcite above it , @xmath38 is singular and can not be expanded as in eq .",
    "( [ fsing - rg ] ) .",
    "the breakdown of this expansion causes a breakdown of the hyperscaling relations and allows us to obtain the mean - field exponents .    the scaling functions @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are expected to be universal , apart from multiplicative normalizations and normalizations of the scaling fields .",
    "this implies that , within the given universality class , they are independent of the microscopic features of the model .",
    "however , they depend on the nature of the boundary conditions .",
    "note also the presence of the variable @xmath100 , which corresponds to the so - called shape factor in classical transitions : the universal scaling functions depend on the shape of the finite system that is considered .",
    "finally , we should also take into account the regular part @xmath101 of the free energy , see eq .",
