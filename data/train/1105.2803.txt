    "this technical note is a supplement to the manuscript @xcite . in that work the dynamics of cells in a cell cycle",
    "were considered when cells are subjected to feedback from other cells in the cell cycle and the response to the feedback is also dependent on the cells location within the cell cycle .",
    "we refer the reader to that manuscript for the biological motivation for this study and for background on the model we study .",
    "we consider a piecewise affine model for the dynamics of cell populations along the cell cycle .",
    "let a population of @xmath4 cells be organized in @xmath5 equal clusters ( @xmath5 divides @xmath4 ) labeled by a discrete index @xmath6 .",
    "for the cluster @xmath7 , the progression along the cycle is represented by the periodic variable @xmath8 which evolves in time according to the entire population status .",
    "more specifically , the variables follows the deterministic flow associated with a real vector field @xmath9 , _ i.e. _ @xmath10 , that is the same for each @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath11 are two parameters respectively governing the length of the _ signaling _ @xmath12 and of the _ responsive _ @xmath13 regions",
    ". let @xmath14 represent the fraction of cells in the signaling region @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 then we will consider the case that @xmath9 assumes a simple expression @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the floor function . in short terms , clusters in the responsive region are accelerated by a fraction equal to the proportion of cells in the signaling region .",
    "in @xcite we consider systems in which the feedback experienced by cells @xmath19 is a general monotone increasing or decreasing function of @xmath14 .",
    "relabeling , integer translation of coordinates , and time translation are symmetries of the dynamics .",
    "thus , one can assume that all coordinates @xmath20 are initially well - ordered and belong to the same unit interval , _",
    "i.e. _  we have @xmath21 the definition of the vector field @xmath9 implies that the coordinates can not cross each other as time evolves ; thus this ordering is preserved under the dynamics .",
    "moreover , the first coordinate @xmath22 must eventually reach 1 ( not later than at time 1 ) , _ i.e. _  there exists @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , and more generally , it must reach any positive integer as time runs .",
    "thus the set @xmath25 defines a poincar section for the dynamics and the mapping @xmath26 defines the corresponding return map .",
    "we rely on the following considerations . starting from @xmath27 ,",
    "compute the time @xmath28 that @xmath29 needs to reach 1 and compute the location of the remaining cells at this date . define @xmath30 to be this mapping .",
    "( we assume first that @xmath31 for simplicity , but we will relax this soon . ) @xmath32 notice that @xmath33 by assumption on @xmath34 .    now",
    "the time @xmath35 that @xmath36 needs to reach 1 , together with the population configuration at @xmath37 , follow by applying @xmath30 to the configuration @xmath38 . by repeating the argument",
    ", the desired return time @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and the desired return map is @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , to understand the dynamics , one only has to compute the first map @xmath30 .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that we may regard @xmath30 as a continuous piecewise affine map of the @xmath42-dimensional simplex @xmath43 into itself .",
    "( although the boundaries 0 and 1 are identified in the original flow , in the analysis here , we consider them as being distinct points for @xmath30 . )    on the edges of the simplex , @xmath30 has a relatively simple dynamics . indeed",
    "if , initially , all coordinates are equal , then they must all reach the boundary 1 simultaneously .",
    "in other words , on the diagonal ( @xmath44 for all @xmath7 ) , we have @xmath45 where @xmath28 depends on @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( for @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 independently of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "moreover , starting with @xmath52 implies @xmath53 which yields @xmath54 whatever the remaining coordinates @xmath55 are . as a consequence , the edge @xmath56\\right\\}\\ ] ]",
    "is mapped onto @xmath57\\right\\}\\ ] ] which is mapped onto @xmath58\\right\\}$ ] and so on , until it reaches the edge @xmath59 which is mapped back onto the diagonal ( after @xmath5 iterations ) .",
    "a particular orbit on the edges is the @xmath5-periodic orbit passing the vertices , and which corresponds to the single cluster of velocity 1 in the original flow , namely @xmath60 from a direct analysis in the original system @xcite , we know that this orbit must be asymptotically stable for positive feedback and unstable for negative .",
    "since there are two points of a periodic orbit at each boundary of every edge ( which are themselves globally @xmath5-periodic 1-dimensional sets ) , by the intermediate value theorem , there must be at least one other @xmath5-periodic orbit on the edges with coordinates comprised between 0 and 1 . whether this orbit is unique",
    "might depend on parameters .    finally , since the simplex is a convex and compact invariant set under @xmath30 and the boundary can not contain any fixed point , the brouwer fixed point theorem implies the existence of a fixed point in its interior . from the definition of @xmath30 this corresponds to a solution satrisfying : @xmath61 we call this type of solution a @xmath5-cyclic solution @xcite .",
    "we will study the dynamics of the linear model only for a limited subset of parameter space . it will become clear to the reader that the analysis could be reproduced for the entire parameter space , but doing so would require a prohibitive amount of time and space .      when @xmath0 , @xmath30 is defined in the triangle @xmath62 and maps the pair @xmath63 into @xmath64 , _",
    "i.e. _  not only the hitting time @xmath28 needs to be computed now , but also the location of @xmath65 at this instant has to be specified .",
    "there are numerous cases to study depending on @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "to list them , we primarily use the location of @xmath66 .",
    "* @xmath67 . as for @xmath68 , in this case @xmath66 moves with velocity 1 , even when lying in @xmath19 .",

    "its acceleration depends on the location of @xmath65 at this date , whether @xmath65 belongs to @xmath15 or not .",
    "this alternative is given by the relative sizes of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "considering also the possible cases of acceleration for @xmath65 we get the following sub - cases . * for simplicity , we assume that @xmath77 and @xmath78*. * * @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in this case , @xmath65 is still in @xmath15 when @xmath66 enters @xmath19 .",
    "the assumption @xmath78 implies that both @xmath22 and @xmath65 get out of @xmath15 before @xmath66 reaches 1 ( existence of the third line in the expression below ) . we then have @xmath81 which implies @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , the assumption @xmath77 forces @xmath83 to be out of @xmath15 when @xmath84 enters @xmath19 ( if it does ) .",
    "then @xmath85 in this case .",
