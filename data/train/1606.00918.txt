    "metallic phases that can not be described within landau s fermi liquid framework have been observed in various strongly correlated electron materials , such as cuprate and pnictide superconductors above @xmath4 , or heavy fermion compounds.@xcite one widely discussed theoretical approach leading to non - fermi liquid behavior is to couple electrons to gapless fluctuations of an order parameter close to a quantum critical point ( qcp).@xcite    in this work we focus on the experimentally relevant example of the so - called ising - nematic qcp in two spatial dimensions.@xcite here electrons on a square lattice are coupled to an ising order parameter , which describes a pomeranchuk transition where the four - fold rotational symmetry of the fermi surface is broken down to two - fold rotations .",
    "nematic correlations have been observed in various correlated electron systems , such as underdoped cuprates,@xcite and iron - based compounds.@xcite properties of metals close to a nematic qcp , as well as closely related problems such as electrons coupled to a @xmath5 gauge field , have been extensively discussed in the theory literature.@xcite    our main quantity of interest is the nematic susceptibility ( i.e.  the retarded propagator of order parameter fluctuations ) at small but finite temperatures . within the hertz - millis approach it takes the well known form @xcite @xmath6 which holds for isotropic systems in the regime @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are momentum and frequency , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the fermi velocity ( energy ) , @xmath12 is the temperature ( t ) dependent boson mass ( or inverse correlation length ) and @xmath13,@xmath14 are temperature independent constants .",
    "the characteristic landau damping term @xmath15 arises from the coupling to particle - hole excitations at the fermi surface .",
    "note that it comes with an angular dependence @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the polar angle of @xmath18 , because the coupling between electrons and order parameter fluctuations vanishes by symmetry along the nodal directions @xmath19 . at the qcp where @xmath20 vanishes",
    ", the susceptibility obeys scaling with a dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 , i.e.  it is invariant under rescaling @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    at zero temperature eq",
    ".   also holds beyond the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in higher order perturbation theory , as well as within a self - consistent eliashberg - type approximation , where bare propagators are replaced with full propagators.@xcite more recent works focusing on the critical properties at zero temperature realized that the hertz - millis rpa approach has conceptual problems , however .",
    "while it was previously believed that the rpa can be justified in a large @xmath23 limit,@xcite where @xmath23 is the number of fermion flavors , it has been realized that such large @xmath23 expansions break down due to intricate quasi one - dimensional scattering processes in certain subsets of feynman diagrams.@xcite subsequently several approximation schemes have been developed where controlled expansions in a small parameter can be performed , such as a combination of small @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 fixed,@xcite an expansion in a large number of boson flavors @xmath27,@xcite or performing an epsilon expansion in the co - dimension of the fermi surface.@xcite    despite these problems , the structure of eq .   is compatible with renormalization group results where bosons and fermions are treated on equal footing .",
    "the dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 remains unchanged up to three loops,@xcite even though more recent four - loop results indicate that anomalous scaling appears at higher loop order.@xcite it is important to note that these rg approaches typically deal with the zero temperature problem .",
    "finite temperature results are usually inferred by assuming @xmath28 scaling in the vicinity of the qcp .",
    "this assumption can be potentially dangerous , however . for example",
    ", it has been shown that the electron scattering rate at the fermi surface is dominated by contributions from _ classical _ fluctuations at low temperatures , which do not obey @xmath28 scaling.@xcite    substantial progress towards a numerical solution was made by schattner _",
    "et al._,@xcite who realized that the ising - nematic problem is amenable to unbiased monte carlo simulations avoiding the infamous fermion sign problem .",
    "surprisingly , the finite temperature form of the nematic susceptibility found in this work is consistent with a dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 , rather than @xmath1 obtained in previous field theoretical approaches at @xmath29 .",
    "it remains to be seen if the temperatures in the numerical simulations are low enough to probe the scaling regime of the qcp , or if something is missing in the field theoretical approaches .    here",
    "we investigate finite temperature properties of the nematic susceptibility in the quantum critical regime above the qcp .",
    "we focus on the important interplay between bosonic and fermonic excitations at finite temperature using an eliashberg - type approach , where the boson and fermion self - energies are computed in a self - consistent one - loop approximation . at finite temperature",
    "the eliashberg approach is shown to give qualitatively different results compared to rpa , in contrast to the zero temperature case .",
    "in particular , the nematic susceptibility takes the form @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the temperature dependent electron scattering rate and @xmath10 is the fermi velocity .",
    "this result suggests that at any finite temperature there is always an energy window where the order parameter fluctuations are characterized by a dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 , rather than @xmath1 at zero temperature @xcite . in the zero temperature limit where @xmath3 vanishes we recover eq .  .",
    "a potential shortcoming of the result in eq .",
    "is that the frequency dependent term does nt vanish in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "this is a particularly severe problem for the closely related problem of electrons at a ferromagnetic qcp , where the order parameter is conserved .",
    "indeed , the eliashberg approach is an uncontrolled approximation where potentially important vertex corrections are neglected , which can lead to violations of ward identities .",
    "however , in the important limit @xmath34 the boson velocity is small compared to the fermi velocity and standard arguments in analogy to migdal s theorem should apply , which ensures the smallness of vertex corrections , at least in the zero temperature limit.@xcite    at finite temperature the situation is different , because classical ( frequency independent ) fluctuations - which are not present at zero temperature - dominate the vertex correction .",
    "consequently , our problem is seemingly similar to the disordered electron gas , where vertex corrections are large and the vertex develops a diffuson pole .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that in the quantum critical regime both classical and quantum fluctuations are equally important .",
    "in fact , we argue that the vertex does not develop a diffuson pole if quantum fluctuations are taken into account and the results of the eliashberg approximation remain qualitatively valid .",

    "note that for large enough couplings @xmath44 this intermediate @xmath0 regime can be found at arbitrary low temperatures .",

    "in order to support our analytical considerations , we present results from a full numerical solution of the eliashberg equations and in the following .",

    "in order to assess the validity of the eliashberg approximation we compute the leading one loop vertex corrrection shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] at finite temperature , using the approximate form of the propagators obtained in sec",

    "since the important scattering processes involve electrons in the vicinity of the fermi surface with small momentum transfer , we only consider the vertex at vanishing external boson momentum @xmath43 and external electron momentum on the fermi surface @xmath127 , as well as take the limit of a vanishing incoming electron frequency @xmath128 in the following .",
    "furthermore , realizing that the momentum integral in eq .",
    "is dominated by small momenta , we expand the d - wave form factors in small @xmath129 and only retain the leading order term @xmath130 .    for the following discussion it is convenient to split the vertex correction into a classical and a quantum part @xmath131 .",
    "the classical part comes from the zero frequency term in the matsubara sum in eq .  , whereas the summands with non - zero frequencies describe contributions from quantum fluctuations of the boson mode and constitute the quantum part of the vertex .",
    "while classical fluctuations do nt exist at zero temperature ( where the matsubara sum becomes an integral and the zero frequency term is a set of measure zero ) , they are actually dominant at non - zero temperatures , as we ll show in the following .",
    "the computation of the classical part of the vertex correction is analogous to the problem of the disordered electron gas and the largest contribution comes from the term where one electron propagator is retarded and the other one is advanced . using the approximations mentioned above and performing the analytic continuation @xmath132 and @xmath133 as well as taking the limit @xmath128 , the classical part of the vertex correction takes the form    @xmath134    where the dots denote higher order terms in @xmath9 .",
    "the classical contribution to the leading vertex correction at zero external frequency is temperature independent and equal to the bare vertex @xmath135 .",
    "consequently it is not negligible and vertex corrections need to be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory . performing a ladder resummation of the classical vertex correction and neglecting the quantum contribution ,",
    "the vertex would be given by @xmath136 note that the classical vertex develops the well known diffuson pole , familiar from the theory of the disordered electron gas .",
    "the presence of a diffuson pole would invalidate the eliashberg approximation and change the scaling properties of the boson self - energy drastically .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that the problem of the ising - nematic quantum critical metal at finite temperature differs from the disordered electron gas in one crucial aspect : in the quantum critical regime at finite temperature both classical and quantum fluctuations are equally important and it is not permissible to neglect the contribution from quantum fluctuations , even though the classical fluctuations dominate . in order to estimate the quantum correction to the vertex",
    ", we simply compute the one loop diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] at zero temperature using the approximate zero temperature form of the propagators ( i.e.  set @xmath137 , @xmath138 and use @xmath139 instead of @xmath140 in eq .  ) . at vanishing external frequencies",
    "we obtain @xmath141 note that the quantum correction comes with a negative sign . again performing a ladder resummation of the vertex correction taking into account both classical and quantum contributions",
    ", the vertex now takes the form @xmath142 the crucial difference to eq .",
    "is that the quantum correction gaps out the diffuson pole of the classical vertex .",
    "more importantly , using this form of the vertex to compute the boson self energy beyond the eliashberg approximation does nt alter the scaling properties of the imaginary part derived in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] as long as @xmath143 is small compared to the quantum vertex correction .",
    "consequently we expect that the eliashberg approximation gives qualitatively valid results at finite temperature and small frequencies .",
    "in this work we considered two dimensional metals in the vicinity of an ising - nematic quantum critical point and discussed properties of the nematic susceptibility at finite temperature based on an elisahberg - type approach .",
    "our results have some similarities to the monte carlo results by schattner _",
    "et al._,@xcite who find a nematic susceptibility consistent with @xmath0 scaling in the quantum critical regime and no angular dependence on momentum .",
    "however , in order for our results to be consistent with their data , the electron scattering rate has to be of order @xmath11 even at the the lowest temperatures , otherwise the crossover to @xmath144 behavior should be visible in the monte carlo data at large momenta @xmath145 . in our numerical solution of the eliashberg equations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the scattering rate is always substantially smaller than @xmath11 , even at relatively high temperatures , and the crossover to the standard landau damping form is always visible .",
    "it thus remains to be seen if the phenomenology discussed here is indeed responsible for the behavior observed in the monte carlo data .",
    "we are grateful for very helpful discussions with d.  chowdhury , a.  chubukov , and e.  berg .",
    "furthermore we d like to thank an anonymous referee for drawing our attention to the analogy between classical vertex corrections and the disordered electron gas .",
