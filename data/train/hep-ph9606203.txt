    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a plausible candidate as an origin of the hierarchy between the weak scale and higher scales , say the grand unification ( gut ) and/or the gravitational scales .",
    "it must be broken at low energy so that the observed particles do not have their superpartners with the same masses .",
    "we consider dynamical susy breaking ( dsb ) as the mechanism of susy breaking at low energy since dsb gives a complete solution to the hierarchy problem  it can induce a very tiny scale compared with the gravitational scale without any fine - tunings of parameters in the theory .",
    "in particular , low - energy models of dsb ( so - called visible sector models ) are attractive also in that they can give a natural solution to the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem through the mass degeneracy of the squarks and sleptons @xcite .",
    "there are two methods to mediate the low - energy susy breaking in the dsb sector to the susy standard - model sector .",
    "one is to identify a global symmetry in the dsb sector as gauge groups in the standard model .",
    "vector - like gauge theories of dsb proposed in ref.@xcite , since the anomaly - free condition for the standard - model gauge interactions is manifestly satisfied without introducing additional fields . ] this approach , however , has difficulty that the su@xmath0 gauge coupling constant tends to blow up at too low an energy scale .",
    "the other is to introduce a messenger sector which couples to the both sectors .",
    "the phenomenological models with low - energy dsb proposed so far @xcite share the common structures : dsb is realized in chiral gauge theories and susy - breaking effects are mediated to the susy standard - model sector by an additional messenger gauge interaction which is introduced only for that purpose .",
    "the additional gauge interaction is needed since the dsb and the standard - model sectors are both chiral .    in this paper we investigate a model with a vector - like gauge theory as the susy - breaking sector .",
    "we adopt vector - like models of dsb proposed recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "we see that it is not necessary to introduce the messenger gauge interaction , whose coupling threatens to blow up .",
    "note that this may largely reduce complication in the model building .",
    "we also consider various other ways of susy - breaking transmission .",
    "let us consider a susy su(2 ) gauge theory with four doublet chiral superfields @xmath1 and six singlet ones @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the flavor indices ( @xmath5 ) . without a superpotential , this model has a flavor su(4)@xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the tree - level superpotential of the model @xcite is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote generic coupling constants with @xmath9 .",
    "susy remains unbroken perturbatively in this model .",
    "the exact effective superpotential of the model , which takes into account the full nonperturbative effects , may be written in terms of gauge - invariant low - energy degrees of freedom @xmath10 as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an additional chiral superfield , @xmath13 denotes the pfaffian of the antisymmetric matrix @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a dynamical scale of the su(2 ) gauge interaction .",
    "this is none other than a superpotential of the oraifeartaigh type .",
    "namely , this effective superpotential yields conditions for susy vacua @xmath16 which are incompatible as long as @xmath17 .",
    "therefore we conclude that susy is dynamically broken in this model @xcite .",
    "let us impose a flavor sp(4)@xmath6 symmetry on the above model to make our analysis simpler , where we adopt the notation @xmath18 .",
    "then the effective superpotential can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are singlets and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are five - dimensional representations of sp(4)@xmath6 , respectively , in @xmath14 and @xmath24 , which constitute six - dimensional representations of su(4)@xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote coupling constants which are taken to be positive .",
    "when the coupling @xmath26 is small , the effective superpotential @xmath28 implies that we obtain the following vacuum expectation values : @xmath29 then the low - energy effective superpotential may be approximated by and @xmath22 form massive multiplets with mass of order @xmath30 and they are integrated out . ]",
    "@xmath31    on the other hand , the effective khler potential is expected to take a form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a real constant of order one .",
    "then the effective potential of the scalar @xmath21 ( with the same notation as the superfield ) is given by @xmath34 when @xmath35 , this leads to @xmath36 .",
    "otherwise , we suspect that @xmath37 is of order @xmath38 since the effective potential is expected to be lifted in the region far from the origin ( @xmath39 ) , as is the case for the oraifeartaigh model @xcite . in any event",
    ", the dsb scale is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the @xmath42 component of the superfield @xmath21 , and the mass @xmath43 of the scalar @xmath21 is seen to be of order @xmath44 except for the potential massless @xmath45-axion .",
    "we henceforth assume @xmath35 for definiteness .",
    "the messenger sector consists of chiral superfields @xmath46 , which are all singlets under the strong su(2 ) and the global sp(4)@xmath6 .",
    "@xmath47 is also a singlet under the standard - model gauge group . as for @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "we tentatively assume that they transform as the down quark , the anti - lepton doublet and their antiparticles , respectively .",
    "the interactions between the dsb and the messenger sectors are described by a superpotential @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote su(2 ) gauge indices and the couplings @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are taken to be positive . in the following ,",
    "we set @xmath57 for simplicity , which approximately holds in susy - gut s .    in view of eqs.([vevs ] ) and ( [ effpot ] ) , the full effective superpotential of the dsb and messenger sectors is obtained as @xmath58 where we have used @xmath59    the khler potential of @xmath21 and @xmath47 is expected to have the following form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a real constant of order one .",
    "we notice that non - anomalous @xmath45 and discrete symmetries with the coupling @xmath54 as an external field charges of @xmath62 read @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the discrete symmetry amounts to a transformation @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 . ]",
    "may be utilized to see that there are no trilinear terms such as @xmath68 in the above khler potential .",
    "as we will see below , we obtain vanishing @xmath42 component of @xmath47 , @xmath69 , in a limit @xmath70 . in that case , the susy breaking is not transmitted to the standard - model sector by means of the singlet @xmath47 .",
    "typical feynman diagrams generating @xmath54-dependent corrections to the khler potential in eq.([kahler ] ) are shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "we obtain an effective potential from eqs.([messpot ] ) and ( [ kahler ] ) @xmath71 where we have taken into account only the leading corrections in the coupling @xmath53 .    we restrict ourselves to the vacua with @xmath72 in the following consideration since ,",
    "otherwise , the standard - model gauge group would be broken by their vacuum expectation values .",
    "notice that the above vacua is realized when the coupling @xmath73 is large enough .",
    "then the potential eq.([fullpot ] ) yields a vacuum given by @xmath74 the messenger quarks and leptons have masses @xmath75 of order @xmath15 in this vacuum : @xmath76 since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are non - vanishing , the susy breaking is mediated to the standard - model sector as seen in the next section .",
    "the standard - model gauginos obtain their masses from radiative corrections through loops of the messenger quarks and leptons @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 denote the standard - model gauge couplings .",
    "the masses of the squarks and sleptons are given by @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 or @xmath83 and @xmath84 or @xmath85 , whose non - vanishing values are the quadratic casimir invariants for the fundamental representations of su(3)@xmath86 and su(2)@xmath87 , respectively , and @xmath88 denotes the corresponding hypercharges squared .",
    "namely , the squarks and sleptons have the masses of the same order as the gaugino masses .",
    "notice here that the squarks and sleptons with the same quantum numbers of the standard - model gauge group degenerate in mass , which leads to the suppression of fcnc as noted in the introduction .",
    "we now proceed to consider phenomenological constraints on the parameters in the potential eq.([fullpot ] ) .",
    "first , the gluino mass should be ( @xmath89 ) gev to maintain the weak scale of order @xmath90 gev .",
    "this is because growth of the gluino mass increases the stop mass ( see eq.([scalarm ] ) ) and the large stop mass raises the higgs masses which determine the weak scale .",
    "thus we demand @xmath91    second , the gravitino mass @xmath92 should be less than about 1 gev to keep the mass degeneracy of the squarks and sleptons explaining the required suppression of fcnc @xcite : due to supergravity effects . ]",
    "@xmath93 where @xmath94 is the gravitational scale , that is , @xmath95 gev .    in terms of the parameters , @xmath96 , for instance",
    ", we get @xmath97 from eq.([gluinomass ] ) . by means of eq.([fcnc ] ) , this gives @xmath98 for @xmath99 we get @xmath100 the gravitino mass is given by @xmath101 in the case of @xmath102 kev , the reheating temperature @xmath103 after inflation should be very low as @xmath104 gev to avoid the overclosure of the universe @xcite .",
    "thus , we must invoke a late - time baryogenesis like in the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite .",
    "in this final section , we deal with a few remaining aspects of our model .",
    "first we consider the polonyi problem on the singlet @xmath21 .",
    "the mass of @xmath21 is given by @xmath105 this shows that the singlet causes no cosmological problem @xcite .",
    "second we argue a naturalness problem in the messenger sector .",
    "the relevant superpotential is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the right - hand side in eq.([spsinglet ] ) .",
    "we can consistently impose u(1)@xmath108 symmetry symmetry is anomalous and there is no light @xmath45-axion . ] with the charges of @xmath109 as @xmath110 .",
    "however , this @xmath45 symmetry allows additional terms such as @xmath111 . in order for our susy - breaking vacuum to be ( meta)stable",
    ", the coupling @xmath112 should be extremely small .. the fact that @xmath113 may originate from the charge difference between the two terms @xmath114 and @xmath111 . ]",
    "third we comment on the @xmath115-problem .",
    "let us consider an interaction @xmath116 as a direct source for the @xmath115-term @xmath117 in the superpotential : @xmath118 then we also obtain a soft mass term @xmath119 in the potential with @xmath120 together with eq.([gauginomass ] ) , these yield @xmath121 which implies that the value @xmath122 is too large .",
    "thus we should give up the direct generation of the @xmath115-term .",
    "when we obtain an appropriate @xmath115-term by some way or others @xcite , the su(2)@xmath123 u(1)@xmath124 breaking may be induced by radiative corrections .",
    "we note that even the messenger singlet @xmath47 may be unnecessary if an appropriate mass terms for the messenger quarks and leptons @xmath125 are generated like the @xmath115-term",
    ". then the susy breaking may be mediated by introducing a messenger gauge interaction for the messenger quarks and leptons as well as @xmath1 .",
    "finally we comment on hidden sector models of dsb with vector - like gauge theories .",
    "since susy - breaking is communicated by gravity in hidden sector models , we need to introduce no messenger sector ( no fields such as @xmath46 ) , which enables us to respect naturalness thoroughly .",
    "sizable gaugino masses stem from terms of the form @xmath126 , which is compatible with u@xmath127-charge assignments of @xmath21 and @xmath107 as zero and two , respectively .",
    "then we get an effective superpotential @xmath128 we expect a susy - breaking local minimum at @xmath129 for the effective potential corresponding to eq.([hidden ] ) in supergravity @xcite in view of section 2 . when @xmath130 gev and @xmath131 , the gravitino mass turns out to be @xmath132 gev ( see eq.([fcnc ] ) ) , which characterizes the susy - breaking scale in the standard - model sector .",
    "note that @xmath133 gev in this case so that the singlet @xmath21 causes no cosmological problem .",
    "however , in contrast to the visible sector models , the fcnc problem is not automatically resolved in the hidden sector models .",
