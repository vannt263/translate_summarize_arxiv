    "recent revelations of massive surveillance programs @xcite have emphasized the necessity of secure communication systems that do not just protect the content of the user s message from being decoded , but prevent the detection of its transmission in the first place .",
    "indeed , encrypted data or even just the transmission of a signal can arouse suspicion , and even the most theoretically robust cryptographic security scheme can be defeated by a determined adversary using non - computational methods such as side - channel analysis .",
    "covert , or _ low probability of detection / intercept _ ( lpd / lpi ) communication capability is thus very important in extremely sensitive situations ( e.g. , during military operations or for organization of civil unrest ) .    in the covert communication scenario ,",
    "alice transmits a message to bob over a noisy channel while the adversary , warden willie , attempts to detect her transmission .",
    "the channel from alice to willie is also subject to noise .",
    "thus , while alice transmits low - power covert signals to bob , willie attempts to classify these signals as either noise on his channel or signals from alice .",
    "we recently showed that the _ square root law _ ( srl ) governs covert communication : provided that alice and bob pre - share a secret of sufficient length and alice can tolerate a small probability of being detected by willie , she can reliably transmit @xmath0 bits to bob in @xmath1 uses of an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel while keeping ineffective any detector employed by willie .",
    "conversely , attempting to transmit more that @xmath0 either results in detection by willie with probability one or non - zero decoding error probability at bob as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "follow - on work has addressed the size of the pre - shared secret @xcite , the optimal constant hidden by the asymptotic ( big-@xmath7 ) notation @xcite , network aspects of covert communication @xcite , extensions of srl to bosonic channels where the adversary is only limited by the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite , and , finally , practical limitations on the adversary that improve the covert throughput to beyond the srl limit @xcite .    here",
    "we explore another limitation on the adversary s capabilities .",
    "studies of covert communication up to now assume that willie knows when alice may start to transmit ( if she does ) . however , there are many practical scenarios where this assumption can be relaxed and alice s communication start time is unknown to willie .",
    "for example , a possible transmission time can be pre - arranged in advance .",
    "alice s message may also be much shorter than the total time available to transmit it ( e.g. ,  a few seconds out of the day when both alice and bob are available ) .",
    "thus , since willie does not know when alice may transmit , he has to monitor a much longer time period than the duration of alice s transmission .",
    "here we show how alice can leverage willie s ignorance of her transmission time to transmit significant additional information to bob .",

    "<S> the recent _ square root law _ ( srl ) for covert communication demonstrates that alice can reliably transmit @xmath0 bits to bob in @xmath1 uses of an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel while keeping ineffective any detector employed by the adversary ; conversely , exceeding this limit either results in detection by the adversary with high probability or non - zero decoding error probability at bob . </S>",
    "<S> this srl is under the assumption that the adversary knows _ when _ alice transmits ( if she transmits ) ; however , in many operational scenarios he does not know this . </S>",
    "<S> hence , here we study the impact of the adversary s ignorance of the time of the communication attempt . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a slotted awgn channel model with @xmath2 slots each containing @xmath1 symbol periods , where alice may use a single slot out of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> provided that alice s slot selection is secret , the adversary needs to monitor all @xmath2 slots for possible transmission . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this allows alice to reliably transmit @xmath3 bits to bob ( but no more ) while keeping the adversary s detector ineffective . to achieve this gain over srl , bob does not have to know the time of transmission provided @xmath4 , @xmath5 . </S>"
