    "let us start with a brief description of the continuous wavelet transformation ( wt ) .",
    "the wt of function @xmath2 is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a normalization constant subject to the choice of wavelet .",
    "the decomposition described by equation ( [ g1 ] ) is performed by convolution of the function @xmath2 with a bi - parametric family of self - similar functions generated by dilatation and translation of the analyzing function @xmath5 called a wavelet , @xmath6 where the scale parameter @xmath7 characterizes the dilatation , and @xmath8 characterizes the translation . it is a kind of `` window function '' with a non - constant window width .",
    "high frequency wavelets are narrow due to the factor @xmath9 , while low frequency wavelets are much broader .",
    "the function @xmath5 should be well localized in both time and fourier space and must obey the admissibility condition , @xmath10 .",
    "this condition requires @xmath5 must be an oscillatory function and , if the integral ( [ g1 ] ) converges , the completeness of the wavelet functions provides the existence of inverse transformation , @xmath11    in contrast to fourier analysis , the wt depends both on @xmath12 and the frequency providing an optimal compromise with the uncertainty principal .",
    "one of the advantages of wavelet analysis is a fairly low sensitivity of the restored signal to any physically reasonable continuation of the function @xmath2 outside the interval @xmath13 where the data are known . to fill in gaps between the experimental points",
    "we use a linear interpolation ( different interpolations lead to minimal difference in the restored signal ) . note that since the average value of any wavelet is zero , the mean value of the wt is zero , so that @xmath14 must be added to the reconstructed signal to restore the mean value of the original signal .",
    "wavelets with good localization and a small number of oscillations are commonly used to recognize the local features of data , and to find the parameters of dominating structures ( location and scale / width ) . in this work",
    ", we use one of the most popular wavelets of this type , the so - called `` mexican hat '' , @xmath15 this wavelet is plotted in figure 1 for three values of the scale parameter , @xmath16 , 2 and 0.5 .    .",
    "solid line @xmath17 @xmath5 , dashed line @xmath17 @xmath18 , dotted line @xmath17 @xmath19 . ]",
    "our first goal is to use wavelet methodology to compare the qcd prediction of @xmath0 to experimental data in the center of mass energy range up to about 7 gev . in zeroth order in the strong coupling constant @xmath20 , the ratio @xmath0 is given by    @xmath21    where the summation extends over the quark flavors @xmath22 available up to the center of mass energy @xmath23 .",
    "the qcd @xmath20 corrections to @xmath24 can be presented in different forms . to be specific",
    "we adopt the form of reference [ 1 ] , @xmath25 ,        \\label{e6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm v}_q = \\left [ 1 - 4m_q^2 / q^2 \\right ] ^{1/2 } , \\ ; \\ ; t({\\rm v } ) = { \\rm v } \\left ( 3-{\\rm v}^2 \\right ) /2 , \\nonumber\\\\ g({\\rm v } ) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3 } \\left [ \\frac{\\pi}{2{\\rm v } } - \\frac{3 + { \\rm v}}{4 } \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{2 } - \\frac{3}{4\\pi } \\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the summation in ( [ e6 ] ) is over all quark flavors whose masses @xmath27 are less than @xmath28 . for this analysis we use the quark masses , the form of the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 calculated in [ 3 ] and the energy dependence of @xmath31 from [ 2 ] .",
    "it is very hard to determine the role of these qcd corrections by comparison with experimental data for @xmath32 due to the large statistical errors and plethora of overlapping and interfering resonances in this region .",
    "an additional complicating factor is that the qcd perturbative approach exhibits sharp quark - antiquark thresholds .",
    "however , a meaningful comparison can be made by applying some type of `` smearing '' procedure , which has the effect of smoothing out rapid variations in both the theoretical and experimental values of @xmath0 .    before describing our wavelet analysis of this data",
    "it is worth considering the methodology developed in references [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] to compare experimental data and qcd predictions .",
    "the smearing procedure used in these analyses calculates a smeared ratio @xmath0 as follows , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the square of the center of mass energy and @xmath35 is the `` smearing '' parameter . in references",
    "[ 1 ] and [ 2 ] to evaluate the integral ( [ e7 ] ) , it was necessary to exclude sharp resonances , such as the @xmath36 and the much wider @xmath37 peak .",
    "in addition , a term is added to account for the contribution from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , assuming that @xmath0 remains constant above @xmath40 .",
    "originally , the smearing procedure in reference [ 1 ] supposes a global constant value @xmath41 in ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "however it was found in reference [ 2 ] that for different energy regions it would be better to use different values of @xmath35 .",
    "note that the use of an energy dependent @xmath35 in ( [ e7 ] ) reflects the necessity for different treatment of different energy scales .",
    "the wt methodology provides an alternative , model independent , smearing method , which does not require different treatment in differing energy scales . under wt to separate the signal from the background noise , wavelet reconstruction is performed for scales greater than a certain scale @xmath42  the boundary , or cut - off , scale [ 4 ] . in deciding on the appropriate boundary scale that will separate the noise - like high frequency components of the data",
    "we take a pragmatic line of reasoning .",
    "that is , the best choice for @xmath42 is the smallest value which will smooth out any rapid variations in the data enabling us to reproduce stable results for low frequencies ( resonance area ) .",
    "a similar pragmatic strategy was applied in the analyses of [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] in choosing the parameter @xmath35 of equation ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "the best value of @xmath35 is large enough to compare the smeared @xmath0 with qcd models , but not so large that all the fine detail of the data is smoothed away .    .",
    "dashed and solid bold curves correspond to wavelet reconstruction of the experimental data with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . dashed and solid thin curves correspond to wavelet reconstruction of qcd calculations ( [ e6 ] ) with the same @xmath42 values . ]",
    "figure 2 displays wavelet reconstructed ( smeared ) experimental data with cut - off values @xmath43 ( bold dashed curve ) and @xmath44 ( bold solid curve ) .",
    "the data is a compilation of measurements from many different experiments obtained from the particle data group ( pdg ) [ 5 ] .",
    "in contrast to the analyses of [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , under the wt approach there is no need to remove sharp resonances ( @xmath36 etc . ) by hand , they effectively become part of the high frequency noise and the wavelet analysis smears them out . the thin dashed line and thin solid line are wavelet reconstructed qcd curves with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the two curves with @xmath44 , representing experiment and theory , are in good agreement .",
    "it should be noted that the contribution to all of the restored data curves in figure 2 from the data region above 6.5 gev is negligible .",
    "detailed information on the charmonium resonances @xmath1 above the @xmath46 threshold at 3.73 gev comes primarily from the measurement of @xmath47 .",
    "this data , provided by the particle physics data group ( pdg ) [ 5 ] , comes from the work of many experimental collaborations over a period of more than 30 years .",
    "several broad vector resonances are observed with varying degrees of clarity .",
    "the current best estimate of the masses and widths from the pdg are presented in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the main difficulty encountered by each of the collaborations in making these measurements is large statistical errors and hence the difficulty of separating resonance `` signal '' from noise .",
    "there is significant disagreement between the collaborations on many of the resonance parameters .",
    "therefore , due to the possibility of systematic errors we do not combine measurements from different experiments , but choose to base this initial analysis on data from the bes collaboration which exhibits clear evidence of four broad resonances above the @xmath46 threshold .",
    "in addition to the pdg values , table 1 shows the masses and widths of these resonances from the most recent bes analysis [ 6 ] .    before analyzing the charmonium resonances parameters",
    ", we first determine the non - resonant background contribution using a wt followed by wavelet reconstruction .",
    "this methodology , with its excellent scaling property , allowing the analysis of data with varying resolution , is ideally suited to separate resonances from noise , background and each other .",
    "a very helpful representation of the wt revealing all the features of the complete spectrum of the signal is the `` time- frequency '' plane ( figure 3(a ) ) .",
    "this is a multi - resolution spectrogram , which shows the frequency ( scale ) contents of the signal as a function of energy .",
    "each pixel on the spectrogram represents @xmath48 for a particular @xmath7 ( scale ) and @xmath12 ( in our case @xmath12 is energy , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the location of spots on the vertical axis ( scale axis , @xmath7 ) corresponds to the width of the maximum .",
    "the intensity of dark spots shows the amplitudes of maxima . the wt image ( wavelet plane ) of the bes charmonium data obtained with the `` mexican hat '' wavelet",
    "is shown in panel ( a ) of figure 3 .",
    "the wt localizes the structures in a fashion that allows us to estimate the masses of the resonances and their widths  all four @xmath45 resonances are clearly seen on the wavelet plane .",
    "the straight horizontal line corresponds to the boundary scale @xmath42 , which can be chosen to cut off small scale structures , which in this case corresponds to experimental noise . by choosing a larger value of @xmath42 it is possible to also cut out the resonances , leaving only the background .",
    "the background curves for three substantially different choices of @xmath42 ( 0.15 , 0.25 and 0.35 ) are displayed in figure 3(b ) . in the following analysis",
    "we show that the charmonium resonance parameters are not sensitive to the choice of @xmath42 .",
    "$ ] ; ( b ) background for @xmath50 ( solid line ) , @xmath51 ( dashed line ) , @xmath52 ( dotted line ) . ]    for each value of @xmath42 we subtract this `` wavelet background '' from the raw experimental data leaving only the contribution from the broad charmonium resonances .",
    "we then perform a least squares fit of the `` signal '' in this energy range to the sum of four breit - wigner resonances of the form , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are , respectively , the mass , total width , leptonic branching fraction and hadronic branching fraction of the resonance .",
    "each breit - wigner has three fitted parameters , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and the product of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is worth noting that since these resonances partially overlap , if their decay channels are specified , we can improve their resolution by using the multi - channel unitary scheme described in reference [ 7 ] .",
    "we defer this investigation to a future analysis .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters for each of the four breit - wigner resonances for backgrounds obtained with three different values of @xmath42 are presented in tables 2 - 4 .",

    "if instead of the wavelet fitted background we fit the data with four breit - wigners and a parabolic ( or linear ) background , including the four highest energy data points , we see that the fourth resonance is not `` well - shaped '' and the last few data points appear to be associated with the background rather than the 4th resonance , see figure 5 .",

    "we believe the fact that the masses and widths were accurately reproduced , despite the fitted background being very different from the input background , is largely due to the clean nature of the simulated data .",
    "real experimental data is clearly more complex , in which case the inability of the standard parabolic background least squares fit to extract an accurate background could lead to less reliable resonance parameters .",
    "experimental measurements of the ratio , @xmath0 , comprise a wide range of structures with large statistical errors , making direct comparison with the predictions of qcd very difficult .",
