    "in this paper , we consider a method for fast numerical computation of the fourier transform @xmath0 with given accuracy in given ranges of the frequency @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we mainly focus on a function @xmath2 in with slow decay as @xmath3 .",
    "the fourier transform is a fundamental tool in various areas such as optics , signal processing , probability theory , and theoretical or numerical methods for differential equations @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , in mathematical finance , option pricing by the fourier transform is an active research topic @xcite . particularly in this area , fast numerical computation of the fourier transform",
    "is required . on the other hand",
    ", it is usually needed to compute the values of @xmath4 in   for many @xmath1 s in some ranges .",
    "then , it is preferable to use some methods to accelerate the computation such as the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .    since the fourier transform   is a definite integral for fixed @xmath1 , we may apply some standard quadrature formulas to   such as newton - cotes type or gauss type formulas .",
    "these formulas can yield accurate approximate values for @xmath4 if the function @xmath2 in   is sufficiently smooth and decays rapidly as @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath5 with slow decay , however , less accurate values are generated by these formulas .",
    "moreover , we may also use double exponential ( de ) formulas by takahasi and mori  @xcite for the computation .",
    "the de formulas are formed by some special variable transformations @xmath6 as @xmath7 for a function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a width between sampling points .",
    "the transformations @xmath6 are called double exponential ( de ) transformations .",
    "the de formulas are very accurate for a reasonably wide class of definite integrals  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , known that the de formulas do not yield so accurate results for oscillatory integrals such as   with slowly decaying  @xmath5 .",
    "several highly accurate formulas for the fourier transform of slowly decaying functions are proposed by ooura and mori  @xcite@xcite and ooura  @xcite . in  @xcite@xcite ,",

    "then , to compute @xmath4 for another @xmath1 , we need to change the parameters in these formulas . in @xcite ,",
    "another de formula is proposed to compute @xmath4 for a certain range of @xmath1 with constant parameters in the formula .",
    "this formula , however , has some restriction for the setting of the range , and direct application of the fft to the formula is not straightforward . on the other hand ,",

    "accuracy of these formulas and applicability of the fft to them are already shown .",
    "it is , however , also reported that errors of them become large for @xmath1 with large @xmath13 or for @xmath1 around points of discontinuity of @xmath14 when @xmath10 and the parameters in @xmath12 are independent of @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the formula in  @xcite with @xmath12 defined by   later .",

    "let @xmath15 be defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 ooura @xcite introduced a continuous euler transform of @xmath14 in   defined by @xmath18 as shown later by lemma  [ lem : e_w ] , this function @xmath19 approximates @xmath14 on some assumptions . then , applying the trapezoidal formula to the integral in   yields a numerical formula : @xmath20 where @xmath10 is a positive real number and @xmath21 is a positive integer . using the approximation  ,",

    "we point out that the function @xmath55 is not an analytic function of @xmath56 in @xmath39 .",

    "it is possible to use another weight function @xmath57 analytic in @xmath39 which realizes a similar formula to  . in this paper",
    ", however , we analyze the formula   to show theoretically that even the non - smooth function @xmath55 can achieve the exponential convergence rate shown in lemma  [ lem : discerr ] .",
    "using lemmas  [ lem : e_w ] , [ lem : discerr ] and  [ lem : trunerr ] , we show in theorem  [ thm : formulaparaerr ] below that appropriate choice of the parameters enables the formula   to compute the fourier transform @xmath4 with given accuracy in given ranges of  @xmath1 .",
    "[ thm : formulaparaerr ] let assumptions  [ assump : f_anal_etc ] and  [ assump : f_l^2 ] be satisfied .",
