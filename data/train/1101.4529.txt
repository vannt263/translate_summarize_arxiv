    "recent high - throughput experiments demonstrate a high level of multi - specific and non - specific binding in protein - protein  @xcite , protein - dna @xcite , and protein - rna  @xcite interactions in a living cell .",
    "these observations challenge a conventional approach of molecular biology usually focusing on just a single pathway or function , or a single binding partner for a protein .",
    "this suggests that in order to predict correctly the properties of molecular interaction networks , one needs to take into account the effect of multiple binding , essentially computing the free energy of the system rather than the energy of individual states .",
    "the latter statement is quite intuitive as any protein in a cell interacts with thousands of proteins ( or dna binding cites ) , and even if one ( or few ) of its interaction partners have stronger binding affinity than others , still weaker interactions are not negligible and they may become even dominant . yet the complexity of biological molecules and a lack of knowledge of accurate inter - molecular interaction potentials hamper computational efforts to predict the free energies of protein - protein , protein - dna , and protein - rna binding .",
    "a key question is how to estimate the binding free energy based on the partial knowledge of the binding energy spectrum .",
    "each energy in the binding energy spectrum is defined here as the inter - molecular interaction energy of a particular bound state of interacting molecules ( e.g. , particular binding configuration of protein - protein or protein - dna complex ) .",
    "it was recently shown that global symmetry properties of proteins , both on structural and sequence levels , generically define the properties of their binding energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown analytically in  @xcite that the probability distribution for the interaction energies of homodimers , @xmath0 , is always wider as compared to heterodimers , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dispersion of @xmath0 .",
    "this statistical law was also confirmed computationally , using one of the most advanced methods for computing protein - protein interactions applied to a large dataset of protein complexes from the protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite .",
    "it was also predicted that proteins possessing a higher level of structural correlations ( clustering ) of amino acids in their interfaces , demonstrate a wider binding energy spectrum , as well  @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently that protein sequences with enhanced strength of diagonal correlations of amino acid positions demonstrate a similar property @xcite .",
    "intuitively it means that the clustering of amino acids of the same type statistically enhances the dispersion of the binding energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "sequences with a higher level of such clustering will possess a larger dispersion than sequences with a lower level of clustering  @xcite .",
    "we have recently analyzed the properties of the energy spectrum of nonspecific protein - dna binding  @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of protein - protein interactions , we also observed that the width of the protein - dna binding energy spectrum depends on the correlation properties of dna , such as the symmetry and the length - scale of dna sequence correlations  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in all of those examples the average interaction energies of the compared spectra are always identical , and only the dispersions of the energy spectra are different , fig . [ fig_gaussian ] .",
    "the predicted effects are thus essentially governed by the fluctuations of energy , and go beyond the mean field .",
    "the case where the average energies are not equal is also discussed below .",
    "we assume here that the probability distribution , @xmath0 , is gaussian .",
    "this is an accurate assertion since , practically , the binding energy , @xmath3 , is a sum of thousands of binary inter - atomic interactions , and this sum is normally distributed according the the central limit theorem  @xcite .    here",
    ", we estimate the relative free energy of two interacting systems characterized by the same average binding energies , @xmath4 , but different dispersions , @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig_gaussian]a .",
    "we show that the free energy , @xmath6 , of the system possessing a wider binding energy spectrum , is always shifted towards lower free energies compared to the system possessing a narrower @xmath0 , even if a finite number of energy levels is known , fig .",
    "[ fig_gaussian]a .",
    "in particular , we show that the partition function , @xmath7 , is almost surely larger than @xmath8 , with the probability , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a finite constant , and @xmath11 is the number of the energy levels used to compute the partition function .",
    "we note that in his seminal work @xcite , derrida has established that in the random energy model , where the energy spectrum of the system , @xmath0 , is gaussian , and the partition function , @xmath12 , for each realization of @xmath0 with @xmath11 energy states , @xmath13 , the quenched average of the free energy , @xmath14 , is equal to the annealed average , @xmath15 , in the thermodynamic limit of large @xmath11 : @xmath16 if the temperature @xmath17 is above some critical temperature , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 @xcite , and @xmath2 is the standard deviation of @xmath0 . using an example from the rosetta docking simulations of protein - protein interactions , we show below that eq .",
    "( [ eq : derrida ] ) provides an accurate estimate for the relative free energy , when @xmath11 reaches only few thousands .",
    "we stress that our model is applicable to interacting systems without a pronounced low - energy ( ground ) state in their energy spectra .",
    "the existence of such a ground state corresponds to a strong , specific binding . on the contrary , a large class of weakly interacting biomolecules in a living cell , such as nonspecific protein - protein , protein - dna , or protein - rna binding , represents the systems where our model is operational . such relatively weak , nonspecific interactions , often called `` promiscuous interactions '' ,",
    "have been shown to play an important role in different cellular processes , and in many cases , the effect of such weak interactions becomes the dominant factor in a living cell @xcite .",

    "we consider the ensemble of the interaction energies , @xmath26 , of two interacting biomolecules , where each energy , @xmath13 , corresponds to a given conformation ( i.e. , a given interaction state ) , @xmath27 , of these molecules .",
    "we begin with the definition of the free energy of the system , @xmath28 , where the partition function , @xmath29 , and we assume for simplicity that @xmath30 , and the energy , @xmath3 , is represented in the units of @xmath21 ; here @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath17 is the absolute temperature .",
    "we also assume that the energy , @xmath3 , obeys the gaussian distribution , @xmath0 , with zero mean , @xmath32 , and standard deviation , @xmath2 .",
    "the set of @xmath11 energy values , @xmath13 , is obtained as a statistical realization of @xmath0 . in what follows",
    "we compare the statistical properties of @xmath33 computed based on the realizations drawn from two distributions with different values of standard deviation , @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig_gaussian]a .",
    "since @xmath34 is a lognormal random variable , it is well - known  @xcite and can be readily verified that the expectation , @xmath35 , and the variance , @xmath36 , of @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : derrida ] ) simply follows from @xmath40 .    for a large number @xmath11 ,",
    "let @xmath41 be independent random variables , so that each of them is distributed identically to @xmath37 . since @xmath42 , by linearity of the expectation , @xmath43 .",
    "also , since @xmath41 are independent , it follows that @xmath44 and the standard deviation of @xmath33 , @xmath45 .",
    "consider now two normal independent random variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 , both having zero mean .",
    "we assume further that the standard deviation @xmath48 of @xmath46 is greater than the standard deviation @xmath49 of @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the corresponding lognormal random variables .",
    "next we show that asymptotically almost surely it holds that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 , @xmath57 , be two positive constants .",
    "then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a positive constant that depends only on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "chebyshev s inequality ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , p.43 ) states that for any random variable @xmath60 with expectation @xmath61 and standard deviation @xmath62 , and any @xmath63 , @xmath64 by the preceding argument ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : variance ] ) ) , for @xmath65 , @xmath66 let @xmath67 hence @xmath68 denote @xmath69 and @xmath70 . observe that since @xmath71 , both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are positive . consequently , @xmath74 . also , by chebyshev s inequality ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cheb ] ) ) , @xmath75    it follows that @xmath76 analogously , @xmath77 hence , by union bound , @xmath78 finally , @xmath79    since the right - hand side of the inequality ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) ) tends to 1 as @xmath11 grows , it follows that the event @xmath80 occurs asymptotically almost surely .",
    "this argument generalizes directly to the scenario when @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are ( not necessarily equal ) large integers .",
    "the generalized inequality is @xmath85 it is easy to understand the obtained results intuitively . in the calculation of the partition function , @xmath29 , @xmath11 energies @xmath13",
    "are drawn from the gaussian distribution .",
    "however , only a subset of _ lowest _ energies provides the dominant contribution to @xmath33 .",
    "the contribution from high energies is small , @xmath86 .",
    "since this dominant subset is localized in the low energy tail , the distribution with a larger standard deviation will obviously deliver the larger partition function .",
    "the major practical implication of our result is the ability to estimate the relative free energy of biomolecular interactions without performing the actual calculations of the free energy .",
    "we establish that a simple , direct relationship between the average free energy difference and the standard deviations of the energy spectra , eq .",
    "( [ eq : derrida ] ) , @xmath87 is accurate for a system where only a finite number of energy levels is known .",
    "we note that our analytical definition of the average free energy relies on the _ annealed _ definition of the average , @xmath88 . in systems without frustration",
    "the latter definition is known to be in excellent agreement with the _ quenched _ averaging , @xmath89 , unlike the case of highly frustrated systems such as spin glasses @xcite or proteins below the glass transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the quenched averaging performed numerically is in excellent agreement with the analytical result , fig .",
    "[ fig_gaussian]b .",
    "the error bars in this plot represent the magnitude of the free energy fluctuations . yet , our central result in this paper is stronger than the statement described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : free_en ] ) . here",
    "we predict for two systems , that even if a single calculation of the free energy is performed for each system , using a single realization of the probability distributions , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and it is known that @xmath5 , then we guarantee that @xmath92 with the probability approaching one , provided that the number of measured energy levels , @xmath11 , in each realization is sufficiently large .",
    "finally we note that if one of the distributions , @xmath90 , is shifted from zero mean by the energy , @xmath93 , the free energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : free_en ] ) gets trivially shifted exactly by this magnitude , @xmath94 .",
