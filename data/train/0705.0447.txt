    "two decades ago , @xcite detected an infrared excess around the da white dwarf g2938 as part of their search for cool companions to white dwarfs . @xcite and @xcite convincingly ruled out the presence of a low - mass stellar companion , and @xcite suggested that the observed infrared excess is caused by a ring of circumstellar dust around the white dwarf , a model further developed by @xcite , and underpinned by spitzer observations @xcite .",
    "another four single white dwarfs with infrared excesses have since then been discovered ( gd362 , @xcite ; gd56 , @xcite ; wd1150 - 153 , @xcite ; wd2115560 , von hippel et al .",
    "2007 ) , plus one additional candidate ( g1678 , @xcite ) .",
    "two common characteristic of all those white dwarfs with circumstellar dust discs are their low temperatures , @xmath2k , and their substantial abundances of photospheric calcium @xcite .",
    "no evidence for the presence of dusty discs has been found around white dwarfs hotter than @xmath3k @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite detected emission lines of caii@xmath08498,8542,8662 in the da white dwarf sdssj122859.93 + 104032.9 , which has a temperature of 22000k , much hotter than the five white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess .",
    "the double - peaked shape of the caii emission lines unambiguously identifies the presence of a rotating ring of gas around sdss1228 + 1040 .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations of sdss1228 + 1040 ruled out the possibility of it being a close binary system where an accretion disc would form from material lost by the companion star .",
    "the detection of a strong mgii@xmath14481 absorption line identifies sdss1228 + 1040 as a daz white dwarf , and indicates a photospheric magnesium abundance close to the solar value .",
    "given that the gravitational sedimentation time scales in the radiative atmosphere are very short @xcite and radiative levitation is negligible @xcite , it is clear that sdss1228 + 1040 is accreting from the circumstellar gas disc .",
    "the absence of hydrogen or helium emission lines from the ring , along with the absence of helium absorption lines from the photosphere of the white dwarf , indicates that the circumstellar disc must be depleted in volatile elements , and @xcite concluded that the most likely origin of this disc is a tidally disrupted asteroid .",
    "sdss1228 + 1040 with its circumstellar gas disc appears hence as the hot counterpart to g2938 and the other cool daz harbouring dust discs .",
    "@xcite identified sdssj104341.53 + 085558.2 ( henceforth sdss1043 + 0855 ) as a good candidate for being the second white dwarf with a circumstellar gaseous metal disc .",
    "we present here follow - up observations that confirm this suggestion .",
    "intermediate resolution spectroscopy of sdss1043 + 0855 was obtained at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) in service mode on 2007 , february 3 , using the double - arm spectrograph isis .",
    "the blue arm was equipped with the r1200b grating and a 4k@xmath42k pixel eev detector , providing a spectral coverage of @xmath5  at a resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath6 . in the red arm ,",
    "the r600r grating was used along with the low - fringing 4k@xmath42k pixel redplus detector , providing a spectral coverage of @xmath7  at a resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "a total of 4 pairs of blue / red spectra with individual exposure times of 20min were obtained under poor seeing ( @xmath9 ) conditions . in june 2006",
    ", we also obtained wht spectroscopy of gd362 , which is one of the cool ( @xmath10k , @xcite ) daz white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess @xcite , and the hotter daz wd1337 + 705 ( grw+70 5824 ) , with an identical setup , except for using the 4.5k@xmath42k pixel marconi detector in the red arm , which is subject to noticeable fringing in the red end of the spectrum .",
    "all data were reduced in a standard way using ` starlink ` software and the ` pamela / molly ` packages .    as anticipated from its sdss spectrum , sdss1043 + 0855 displays double - peaked caii@xmath08498,8542,8662 lines ( fig.[f - caii ] , right panel ) , though at substantially lower strengths compared to sdss1228 + 1040 .",
    "the relatively low quality of the @xmath11-band spectra prevents a dynamical analysis of the disc emission , but the morphology of the line profiles in sdss1043 + 0855 is fairly similar to those observed in sdss1228 + 1040 @xcite , suggesting broadly similar parameters .",
    "no significant trace of caii emission is found in wd1337 + 705 , within the limitations imposed by the ccd fringing .",
    "the red spectrum of gd362 contains caii in absorption from the white dwarf photosphere .",
    "the spectra from the blue arm reveal the presence of photospheric mgii@xmath14481 absorption in sdss1043 + 0855 and wd1337 + 705 ( fig.[f - caii ] , left panel ) .",
    "gd362 is too cold @xcite to exhibit significant mgii@xmath14481 absorption .",
    "the absence of zeeman splitting in the ca triplet limits the magnetic field strength in gd362 to @xmath12 kg ( see @xcite for the weakly magnetic dz g1657 ) .",
    "we have used a grid of model spectra calculated with tlusty / synspec @xcite to analyse the sdss and wht spectra of sdss1043 + 0855 .",
    "the model atmospheres were computed assuming a pure hydrogen composition and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , and sequences of synthetic spectra were subsequently calculated for a variety of mg abundances . in order to determine the temperature and surface gravity of the white dwarf , we fitted both the entire spectrum , as well as the normalised h@xmath13 to h@xmath14 lines .",
    "the balmer lines reach their maximum equivalent widths around @xmath15k for @xmath16 , or @xmath17k higher ( lower ) for @xmath18 @xmath19 , and consequently a fit to the normalised balmer line profiles results usually in a `` hot '' and a `` cold '' solution of comparable quality .",
    "we use the fit to the entire data , continuum plus lines , to choose the solution which better agrees with the slope of the spectrum .",
    "our fit includes h@xmath13h@xmath14 .",
    "the higher balmer lines , even though more sensitive to the surface gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are of too poor a quality in the sdss data to be useful . the best - fit @xmath20 and @xmath21 and their 1-@xmath22 errors are obtained from a bicubic spline interpolation to the @xmath23 values on the @xmath24 grid covered by our model spectra .",
    "the parameters from the best fit to the normalised line profiles are @xmath25k and @xmath26 ( fig.[f - opt_fit ] ) . using an updated version of the evolutionary sequences in @xcite , a white dwarf mass of @xmath27 ,",
    "a radius of @xmath28 cm as well as a cooling age of @xmath29y are derived .",
    "the flux scaling factor between the observed and model fluxes implies a distance of @xmath30pc . while we find good agreement with the surface gravity determined by @xcite with their ` autofit ` procedure , @xmath31 .",
    "our effective temperature is hotter by @xmath32k compared to their value of @xmath33 , suggesting that differing details in the fitting procedure cause systematic uncertainties that can be somewhat larger than the statistical errors .",
    "we have determined the photospheric mg abundances of sdss1043 + 0855 and wd1337 + 305 by fitting tlusty / synspec models with the best - fit @xmath20 and @xmath21 but variable mg abundances to the normalised mgii@xmath14481 line profile observed in the wht spectra .",
    "the widths of the observed mgii lines are consistent in both cases with very low rotational velocities , @xmath34 .",
    "we find for sdss1043 + 0855 a mg abundances of @xmath35 times the solar value , or @xmath36 . for wd1337 + 705 , our fit results in a mg abundance of @xmath37 times the solar value , or @xmath38 , which is in good agreement with the measurement of @xcite .",
    "both our and zuckerman s mg abundance measurements are somewhat lower than that of @xcite , @xmath39 , which was determined from a rather noisy spectrum .",
    "we have measured the equivalent widths of the combined caii triplet in out wht spectra of sdss1043 + 0855 , sdss1228 + 1040 ( from @xcite ) , and wd1337 + 705 . for wd1337 + 705 ,",

    "@xmath42 this paper .",
    "@xmath43 the white dwarf parameter differ very slightly with respect to those in @xcite due to improvments in our fitting procedure .",
    "the discovery of gaseous discs around the two moderately hot white dwarfs sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss1043 + 0855 and dust discs around white dwarfs with @xmath44k indicates that the white dwarf temperature plays a crucial role in determing the phase state of circumstellar debris discs .",

    "@xcite show that the 5 confirmed white dwarfs with dusty discs have accretion rates at the upper end of what is observed in cool daz , and our observations give some evidence that the strength of the caii emission correlates with the the photospheric mg abundance ( fig.[f - mgline ] ) .",
    "it may hence be that the white dwarfs with clearly visible discs represent only the `` tip of the iceberg '' .",
    "the caii emission lines detected in sdss1228 + 1040 and sdss1043 + 0855 offer substantialy dynamical insight into the structures of the circumstellar discs , and long - term monitoring of these line profiles appears worthwhile to probe for evolution of the disc radii and eccentricities .",
