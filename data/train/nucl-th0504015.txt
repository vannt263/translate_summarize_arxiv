    "the physics of hyperfine structure ( hfs ) is driven by magnetic interactions .",
    "this physics has a short - range nature , and is more complicated and challenging than `` softer '' regimes in atomic physics .",
    "this is especially true of the nuclear contribution to hyperfine structure , because the nuclear current density is more complicated than the nuclear charge density and less well understood@xcite .    until very recently hyperfine splittings in light hydrogenic atoms were by far the most precisely measured atomic transitions .",
    "many of these very accurate experiments date back nearly half a century .",
    "theoretical predictions are far less accurate , but have improved considerably in recent years .",
    "non - recoil and non - nuclear contributions@xcite are known through order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermi hyperfine energy ( viz . , the leading - order contribution ) and @xmath2 is the fine - structure constant . because the hadronic scales for recoil and certain types of nuclear corrections are the same ,",
    "recoil corrections are treated on the same footing as nuclear corrections@xcite , and we will call both types `` nuclear corrections . ''",
    "it is very likely that the uncalculated qed terms of order @xmath3 in light atoms contribute less than 0.1 ppm .",
    "although much larger than the experimental errors , this is still significantly smaller than the nuclear corrections .",
    "we restrict ourselves to hydrogenic s - states in this work , because these states maximize nuclear effects .    .",

    "because hyperfine splittings are dominated by short - range physics , we expect the splittings in the @xmath8 s - state to be proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the non - relativistic wave function of the electron .",
    "forming the fractional differences ( in parts per million ) between @xmath11 and @xmath12 leads to the tabulated results .",
    "these large differences reflect neither experimental errors nor uncertainties in the qed calculations ; they directly reflect large nuclear contributions .",
    "one complication in performing the nuclear calculation is obtaining a final result that is tractable for numerical calculations .",
    "a framework fortunately exists for performing systematic expansions@xcite of nuclear matrix elements in powers of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a typical nuclear momentum scale that can be taken to be roughly the pion mass ( @xmath15 140 mev ) , and @xmath16 is the large - mass qcd scale ( @xmath17 1 gev ) typical of qcd bound states such as the nucleon , heavy mesons , nucleon resonances , etc .",
    "this framework , called power counting , also extends to nuclei , where @xmath18 specifies a typical correlation length ( and a reasonable nearest - neighbor distance ) in light nuclei ( @xmath17 1.4 fm ) .",
    "this expansion in powers of @xmath19 should converge moderately well .",
    "for the purposes of this initial work , we restrict ourselves to leading - order terms in the nuclear corrections .",
    "this restriction eliminates nuclear corrections of relativistic order , which we will briefly discuss later .",
    "there have been relatively few relativistic calculations in light nuclei because of the complexity of the nuclear force . the calculations that exist",
    "are known to generate rather small corrections@xcite , and they are especially small in the deuteron case because of its weak binding@xcite .",
    "few calculations exist for the much more complicated three - nucleon systems@xcite .",
    "most nuclear physics knowledge and lore in light nuclei is non - relativistic in nature .    in processes that involve virtual excitation of intermediate nuclear states ( each state @xmath20 with its own energy , @xmath21 , relative to the ground - state energy , @xmath22 )",
    "the excitation energy @xmath23 is of order @xmath24 and typically is a correction to the leading order@xcite .",
    "consistency therefore demands that we drop such terms .",
    "the nuclear recoil energy @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the nuclear mass , has the same scale and can also be dropped .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the deuteron contribution in leading order as carefully as possible , and to use the impulse approximation to evaluate the @xmath5he and @xmath5h results .",
    "this restriction should be accurate to within the 10 - 15% uncertainty of our leading - order approximation and adequate for a first calculation of the trinucleon sector .",
    "this level of accuracy does require the inclusion of the intrinsic hyperfine structure of the nucleons .",
    "we will see that the calculated results are good for deuterium and tritium and fairly good for @xmath5he@xmath6 .",
    "our goal is to present a simple and compelling picture of the nuclear hyperfine structure in @xmath27 , @xmath5h , and @xmath5he@xmath6 , using a unified approach for all . to accomplish this",
    "we invoke a simple and intuitive model of trinucleon structure based on su(4 ) symmetry that is sufficiently accurate to explain the patterns in table  i.",
    "the hyperfine interactions that interest us are simple ( effective ) couplings of the electron spin to the nuclear ( ground - state ) spin : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electron ( pauli ) spin operator and @xmath30 is the nuclear spin ( i.e. , the total angular momentum@xcite ) operator .",
    "other couplings of the electron spin are possible and either generate no hyperfine splitting , none in s - states , or higher - order ( in @xmath2 ) contributions .",
    "coupling of the electron spin to the electron angular momentum ( i.e. , the electron spin - orbit interaction , which vanishes in s - states ) is one example .",
    "we begin with a sketch of the fermi hyperfine splitting in order to establish our notation and conventions .",
    "the electron charge operator ( @xmath31 ) is a space scalar , and by itself does not generate a term of the desired form because nuclear - spin information can not be transmitted via the exchange of the appropriate component of the virtual photon s propagator .",
    "the leading - order term in the hyperfine energy shift consequently has the ( usual ) form of a current - current interaction . @xmath32",
    "where @xmath33 is the current density of the ( dirac ) electron and @xmath34 is the nuclear ( ground - state ) current density . ignoring higher - order ( in @xmath2 ) terms",
    "this expression can be manipulated into the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electron mass and @xmath10 is the usual non - relativistic atomic @xmath37 s - state wave function .",
    "the restriction to atomic s - states limits the current to the magnetic - dipole part , which can be written in terms of the magnetic - dipole operator , @xmath38 , as @xmath39 and @xmath38 can be written in terms of the nuclear ground - state magnetization density @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 defines the nuclear magnetic moment .",
    "we finally obtain the fermi hyperfine energy in the limit @xmath44 : @xmath45 where the factor of @xmath46 leads to a hyperfine splitting of @xmath47 .",

    "( 1 ) leads to an atomic matrix element @xmath49 ( in the standard dirac notation ) that can be evaluated analytically for higher - order coulomb corrections@xcite to the leading contribution of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the nuclear charge .",
    "note that @xmath1 is independent of nuclear structure .    naively calculating higher - order ( in @xmath2 ) corrections from the first part of eqn .",
    "( 4 ) fails because only that part of @xmath10 inside the nucleus ( i.e. , within the magnetic `` size '' , @xmath52 ) contributes to the integral , and that is the ( only ) part of the electron s wave function significantly modified by the nuclear charge distribution , @xmath53 , whose radius , @xmath54 , is nearly the same as @xmath52 . in other words",
    "a proper calculation@xcite must take into account modifications of @xmath55 by @xmath56 , and that necessarily involves one order in @xmath2 higher than @xmath1 .",
    "thus we need to perform a consistent second - order ( in @xmath2 ) calculation of the electron - nucleus interaction , depicted in fig .",
    "these graphs are constructed from the direct , crossed , and nuclear seagull contributions to the nuclear compton amplitude .",
    "only the forward - scattering part of this amplitude is required for the @xmath57 corrections to @xmath1 , and this generates a short - range atomic operator that samples the ( upper - component ) s - state wave functions only near the origin .",
    "the resulting energy shift is then given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the lepton compton amplitude and @xmath60 is the corresponding nuclear compton tensor , both of which are required to be gauge invariant .",
    "the lepton tensor can be decomposed into an irreducible spinor basis ; we can ignore odd matrices and spin - independent components , since they do not contribute to the hyperfine structure at @xmath61 .",
    "we also ignore ( with one exception treated later ) terms that couple two currents together .",
    "it is easy to show that since the nuclear current scales as @xmath62 ( the conventional components of the current have explicit factors of @xmath63 ) , two of them should scale as @xmath64 and generate higher - order ( in @xmath62 ) terms .",
    "this leaves a single term representing a charge - current correlation @xmath65 } { ( q^2 + i \\epsilon)^2 ( q^2 - 2 m_e q_0 + i \\epsilon)}\\ , .",

    "although the term @xmath69 is of non - relativistic order , it does not contribute in conventional approaches because of crossing symmetry .",
    "the explicit form for @xmath70 ( suppressing the nuclear ground - state expectation value , but including all intermediate states , @xmath71 ) is @xmath72 which greatly simplifies eqn .",
    "( 6 ) in the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 , leading finally in this limit to a very simple form when closure is used @xmath75 which is infrared divergent . using @xmath76 and @xmath77 together with @xmath78 , and a lower - limit ( infrared ) @xmath79cutoff , @xmath80 ,",
    "we find @xmath81 where there is an implied ( nuclear ) expectation value . the constant term does not contribute because of the derivative , the @xmath82-term contributes a term proportional to @xmath83 , and the last term is the term we are seeking .",
    "the remaining singular ( second ) term must be treated more carefully .",
    "the part proportional to @xmath84 leads ( because of the integral over @xmath85 ) to a contribution proportional to @xmath51 , the total nuclear charge , and @xmath86 , the nuclear magnetic moment .",
    "since this contribution is already part of @xmath87 , keeping this term would amount to double counting , and we therefore ignore it .",
    "the @xmath85-term on the other hand generates ( unretarded ) dipole transitions , and the singularity @xmath88 arises from neglecting @xmath89 and @xmath36 terms .",
    "theorem@xcite for unretarded electric dipole transitions ( @xmath90 ) generates an additional factor of @xmath91 ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) so this singular term is actually of the form @xmath92 and requires a careful calculation . a rather tedious evaluation of this term in eqn .",
    "( 6 ) leads to @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 in intermediate states .",
    "a similar term arises in the product of two currents mentioned above eqn .",

    "these contributions are completely unimportant , as we now demonstrate .",
    "the constant terms ( including @xmath98 ) are proportional to @xmath99 , which vanishes for non - relativistic dipole operators because they commute .",
    "replacing @xmath91 by a constant ( viz . , the closure approximation ) similarly vanishes .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the nuclear matrix element also vanishes in zero - range approximation , where one neglects the deuteron d - state and the potential in intermediate states ( the structure of the dipole operator weights the tails of the wave functions , and this minimizes the effect of the intermediate - state nuclear potential ) . in perturbation",
    "theory it is possible to show that only the spin - orbit combination of potentials in intermediate states contributes ( i.e. , central and tensor terms cancel ) , and this small potential is of relativistic order @xmath100 , which we have previously agreed to ignore .",
    "one can also show that the non - vanishing deuteron contribution is proportional to @xmath101 , the square of the d- to s - wave asymptotic normalization constant @xmath102 , which is extremely small .",
    "a recent brute - force numerical calculation confirms these estimates@xcite .",
    "the terms @xmath103 and @xmath104 are therefore numerically negligible and can be ignored .",
    "our final result in leading order is a relatively simple expression originally developed in a limiting case by low@xcite for the deuteron , as sketched by bohr@xcite for the same system : @xmath105 where both an atomic and nuclear expectation value is implied , but has been ignored in eqn .",
    "( 11a ) and subsequent equations for reasons of simplicity .",
    "a more convenient representation of this result is obtained by dividing both sides by the expression for the fermi hyperfine energy given by eqn .",
    "since the wigner - eckart theorem guarantees that the resulting form of eqn .",
    "( 11a ) must be proportional to @xmath106 ( which cancels in the ratio ) , we arrive at a simple but powerful expression for the leading - order contribution : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and an expectation value is required of the z ( or `` 3 '' ) component of the vector @xmath109 in the nuclear state with maximum azimuthal spin ( i.e. @xmath110 ) .",

    "( 11c ) in units of fm .",
    "the results of table  i therefore suggest ( correctly ) that low moments are on the order of a few fermi in light nuclei , which is quite sensible .",
    "we predicate our discussion with the deuteron in mind .",
    "other nuclei can and will be treated _",
    "mutatis mutandis_. the isospin of the deuteron ( @xmath113 ) makes it a useful first case .",
    "we note that the nuclear physics in eqn .  ( 11 ) involves the correlation between the nuclear charge operator , @xmath114 , and the nuclear current operator , @xmath115 .",
    "if one inserts a complete set of states between these operators , there will be both elastic contributions ( i.e. , ground - state expectation values ) that are called zemach corrections@xcite , and inelastic contributions ( called nuclear polarization corrections ) .",
    "although we will calculate ( or estimate ) both types , it is much easier to calculate the sum of the two .",
    "the nuclear charge operator contains both isoscalar and isovector pieces , and is non - relativistic in leading order .",
    "we ignore relativistic corrections , as we discussed earlier .",
    "we therefore write the charge operator in the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 and @xmath119 this decomposes the i@xmath120 nucleon s charge operator into proton plus neutron parts .",
    "the densities @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the intrinsic charge densities of the proton and neutron , respectively , while @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the proton and neutron isotopic projection operators , respectively .",
    "the coordinate @xmath125 is the distance of the i@xmath120 nucleon from the nuclear center of mass . we expect that the neutron charge density should play a very minor role , and we will find ( later ) that its contribution is only a few percent of that of the proton .",
    "rather sophisticated models exist for the fourier transform ( i.e. , the form factor ) of @xmath121@xcite .",
    "the nuclear current operator is more complicated , even if we ignore relativistic corrections ( which we will ) .",
    "the problem is the mechanism underlying the nuclear force ( viz .",
    ", the exchange of charged mesons ) , which can also contribute to the nuclear current in the form of meson - exchange currents ( mec ) . these currents largely vanish for isoscalar transitions ( such as the deuteron ground state ) because there is no net flow of charge , but they can be sizable ( 10% - 20% ) for isovector transitions .",
    "one can show that their contribution to the deuteron in eqn .  (",
    "11 ) almost entirely vanishes , and we will henceforth ignore these currents below eqn .",
    "we formally expand the current into convection , spin - magnetization , and meson - exchange parts @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the nuclear convection current , @xmath128 is the i@xmath120 nucleon s momentum in the nuclear center - of - mass frame , @xmath129 is the impulse - approximation magnetic - moment operator , @xmath130 is the nuclear meson - exchange current , and @xmath131 is the nucleon magnetization density for the i nucleon expressed in terms of protons and neutrons separately .",

    "thus their product can be decomposed into single - nucleon plus two - nucleon operators .",
    "these forms are particularly convenient to evaluate .",
    "we first write in an obvious notation that @xmath138 note that the quantity @xmath139 was not part of low s original work , nor was there any evidence at that time that such a term might be significant .",

    "shifting the variables @xmath85 and @xmath84 by @xmath125 leads to @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 determine the proton and neutron parts of the one - body current .",

    "( 18a ) we use @xmath151 @xmath152 , which reproduces this value for the dipole case ( see appendix a for moments and correlation functions determined by this choice of form factors ) .",
    "the r.m.s . radius determined by this @xmath153 is 0.86 fm , which is slightly smaller than the proton charge radius@xcite but slightly larger than its magnetic radius@xcite and thus represents an average value .",

    "these numbers lead to @xmath157 fm , which we will use below .",
    "because this value is such a small fraction of the proton result , the uncertainty in the neutron value plays no significant role .    equation ( 17 ) is still a nuclear operator , and its expectation value depends on the nucleus .",
    "we begin with the deuteron ( which has @xmath158 ) and this eliminates the @xmath159 terms in @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "the number of components in the order discussed is ( 4 ) + ( 4 + 8 + 8) + ( 4 + 16 ) = 64 , as expected . ignoring the tiny s@xmath282-state , very small isospin impurities , and the negligible p - states ,",
    "we can therefore write in an obvious but schematic notation for the trinucleon wave functions @xmath283 it was shown many years ago@xcite that expectation values of the su(4 ) generators for the trinucleons have very simple forms . @xmath284 and @xmath285 where a spin - isospin expectation value of the nuclear spin and isospin operators is still required .",
    "as expected , the spatially symmetric s - state dominates the trinucleon ground states @xmath286 because it minimizes the kinetic energy .",
    "the mixed - symmetry s@xmath170-state is much smaller @xmath287 , while the very strong nuclear tensor force generates a relatively large d - state component @xmath167 .",

    "the mixed spin - isospin generator @xmath288 has the very useful and simple property for the s - state @xmath289 which follows ( except for the factor of @xmath290 ) from the wigner - eckart theorem and the properties of the @xmath291 $ ] state .",
