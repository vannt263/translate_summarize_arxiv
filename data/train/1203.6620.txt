    "it was found that the entanglement entropy in superconducting phase is always less than the one in the metal phase .",

    "let us start with the einstein - maxwell - complex scalar theory with a negative cosmological constant in five - dimensional spacetime @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radius of ads spacetime , field strength @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "moreover , the compactification @xmath20 needed to avoid a conical singularity at @xmath21 gives a dual picture of a three - dimensional field theory with a mass gap , which resembles an insulator in the condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the geometry in the @xmath22 sector just looks like a cigar with its tip at @xmath21 .",
    "the temperature associated with the soliton background is zero .    in order to mimic the superconductor phase ,",
    "we need the soliton solutions with nonvanishing @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the back reaction of the matter fields must be taken into account in order to see the difference of the holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "so we choose the ansatz as follows @xmath24 here we have set @xmath25 without lose of generality .",
    "we require that @xmath26 vanishes at the tip of the soliton . and in order to obtain a smooth geometry at the tip @xmath27 , @xmath28 should be made with an identification @xmath29 the independent equations of motion under this ansatz are given as @xmath30 where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath11 and @xmath39 are the corresponding chemical potential and charge density in the dual field theory , respectively .",
    "there are only four independent parameters at the tip , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "however , the above equations of motion have two useful scaling symmetries  @xcite @xmath41 @xmath42 these two symmetries allow us to pick any values for the position of the tip @xmath27 and @xmath43 . in our numerical calculations , we will simply choose @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , to recover the pure ads boundary , we also need @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in general , a solution will have a nonvanishing @xmath47 . in this case",
    "we will use the scaling symmetry   to shift @xmath47 to zero .",
    "from the discussion in section [ sect : background ] , for given @xmath48 , we can solve the equations of motion for the system by choosing @xmath49 as a shooting parameter .",
    "after solving the coupled equations , we can obtain the condensate @xmath50 from and read off the chemical potential @xmath11 and charge density @xmath39 through .",
    "in this paper we only focus on the case @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is well known that in five - dimensional spacetime , when @xmath53 , the scalar field admits two different quantizations related by a legendre transform  @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 can either be identified as a source or an expectation value . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath54 and consider @xmath55 acting as the vacuum expectation value of the operator @xmath56 .",
    "it is convenient to make a coordinate transformation from @xmath57coordinate to @xmath58coordinate by defining @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the infinite boundary is now at @xmath60 and the soliton tip sits at @xmath61 .",
    "figure exhibits a typical solution , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are two metric functions , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the scalar field and static electric potential , respectively .",

    ", we can use the symmetry to set the boundary geometry the same .",

    ", we can accomplish our purpose easily . as in our units setup , the identification length @xmath69 in the pure soliton is @xmath74 , we scale all @xmath69 for each solution to be @xmath75 from now on",
    ". we should stress here that after the scaling transformation , the tip @xmath27 will be no longer at @xmath76 .",
    "figure reproduces the results in ref .",
    "@xcite by a slightly different manner .",
    "it shows the condensate and the charge density as functions of chemical potential .",
    "it is clear from the figure that as the chemical potential @xmath11 exceeds a critical value @xmath77 for given mass and charge , the condensation of the operators emerges .",
    "this can be identified as a superconductor ( superfluid ) phase . however ,",
    "when less than @xmath77 , the scalar field is vanishing and this can be thought of as the insulator phase , since this system has a mass gap @xmath78 due to the identification in @xmath28 direction .",
    "the condensate of operator @xmath79 ( left plot ) and the charge density @xmath39 ( right plot ) versus chemical potential @xmath11 respectively . here @xmath80 and @xmath69 is scaled to be @xmath74 .",
    "the critical chemical potential in this case is @xmath81 .",
    "it is a typical second order phase transition which can be seen clearly from @xmath82 plot.,title=\"fig : \" ]   the condensate of operator @xmath79 ( left plot ) and the charge density @xmath39 ( right plot ) versus chemical potential @xmath11 respectively . here @xmath80 and @xmath69 is scaled to be @xmath74 .",
    "the critical chemical potential in this case is @xmath81 .",
    "it is a typical second order phase transition which can be seen clearly from @xmath82 plot.,title=\"fig : \" ]    note that it is a second order phase transition in our choice of parameters .",
    "in addition , let us mention that in the theory described by the action ( [ action ] ) , except for the ads soliton solution ( insulator ) and hairy soliton solution ( superconducting soliton ) mentioned above , there do exist another two solutions : the black hole solution without hair ( metal phase ) and black hole solution with hair ( another superconducting phase ) .",
    "the complete phase diagram has been drawn in @xcite .",
    "the details depends on the coupling constant @xmath83 . in this paper",
    "we just focus on the case with zero temperature insultor / superconductor phase transition .",
    "as shown in @xcite , with our choice of parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the phase transition from the insulator to the superconductor always happens .",
    "in particular , for any values of chemical potential beyond the critical one , the superconducting phase always exists .",
    "after finding the gravitational soliton solution with full back reaction of matter fields , we are now ready to calculate the holographic entanglement entropy in this holographic model . due to the fact that the choice of the subsystem @xmath0 is arbitrary , we can define infinite entanglement entropies accordingly . in this paper",
    "we first consider a simple case where @xmath0 is chosen to be a half of the total boundary space .",
    "we assume that the subsystem is defined by @xmath84 and extended in the @xmath85 and @xmath28 directions , where @xmath86 .",
    "then the entanglement entropy can be deduced from the formula as @xmath87 for the pure ads soliton solution , @xmath88 and we can read @xmath89 from metric that @xmath90 .",
    "so the entropy can be easily calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath91 where @xmath92 is the uv cutoff .",
    "note that in our units setup @xmath93 .",
    "the first term is divergent ( @xmath94 ) and represents the  area law \"  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the second term does not depend on the cutoff and thus is physical important .",
    "in fact , this finite term is the difference between the entropy in the pure ads soliton and the one in the pure ads space , because in both cases the divergent part of the entanglement entropy is the same .",
    "the result in ( [ eq18 ] ) implies that the entropy in the ads soliton is less than the one in the pure ads space .",
    "note that the uv behavior of @xmath95 will not change after the operator condensation .",
    "thus the divergent part of the entropy known as the area law will not change because this part is only sensitive to uv quantities .",
    "this can be understood from the gravity solution side , the new solution after the operator condensation still asymptotically approaches to ads space near the ads boundary .",
    "we can write the entanglement entropy in general in the half embedding case as @xmath96 where @xmath97 has no divergence and @xmath98 corresponds to the pure ads soliton .",
    "the value of @xmath97 as a function of chemical potential @xmath11 in the superconductor phase is presented in figure  .",
    "the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential in the half embedding .",
    "the solid red curve denotes the entropy in the superconductor phase , while the dashed blue line is for the pure ads soliton solution .",
    "the entropy rises as the chemical potential @xmath11 is increased after the phase transition , arrives at its maximum at a certain @xmath11 , and then decreases monotonously . ]",
    "one can see from the figure that the entanglement entropy is a constant in the insulator phase .",
    "after condensate , the entropy first rises and arrives at its maximum as the chemical potential @xmath11 increases , then it decreases monotonously .",
    "thus , from @xmath77 to a certain value of @xmath11 , there exits a region where the entropies in the superconductor phase are larger than the one in the insulator phase .",
    "this behavior of entanglement entropy is quite different from the one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the case for the holographic metal / superconductor phase transition has been studied in detail .",
    "it is shown that the entanglement entropy after condensate is always lower than the one in the metal phase and decreases monotonously as temperature is lowered , and the entropy as a function of temperate is found to have a discontinuous slop at the transition temperature @xmath99 , which indicates a reduction in the number of degrees of freedom after condensate .",
    "similarly , we here also find a discontinuity in the slope of the increasing entropy at the critical chemical potential @xmath77 indicated by the vertical dotted black line in figure , which may be considered as a significant reorganization of the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "furthermore , this discontinuity can be regarded as the signature of the second order phase transition .",
    "we next consider a more nontrivial geometry which is a straight belt with a finite width @xmath12 along the @xmath100 direction .",
    "the subsystem @xmath0 sites on the slice @xmath92 and expends in @xmath85 and @xmath28 directions . the holographic dual surface @xmath7 is defined as a three - dimensional surface @xmath101 @xmath102 is the regularized length in @xmath85 direction .",
    "the holographic surface @xmath7 starts from @xmath103 at @xmath92 , extends into the bulk until it reaches @xmath104 , then returns back to the ads boundary @xmath92 at @xmath105 .",
    "it is easy to obtain the induced metric on @xmath7 as @xmath106 using the proposal , we need to minimize the following functional @xmath107=\\frac{r\\gamma}{2g_n}\\int_{r_*}^{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}re^{\\frac{a(r)}{2}}\\sqrt{1+r^4b(r)(dx / dr)^2}dr.\\ ] ] we can deduce the equation of motion for the minimal surface from @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a constant .",
    "we are interested in the case that the surface is smooth at @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath110 .",
    "this condition ensures that @xmath111 .",
    "the width @xmath12 of the subsystem @xmath0 and @xmath112 are connected by the relation @xmath113 finally , we obtain the entanglement entropy as @xmath114 where the uv cutoff has been taken into consideration .",
    "however , there is also a disconnected solution describing two separated surfaces that are located at @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "this configuration is just two copies of the half embedding solution that we discussed above .",
    "so the entanglement entropy of the disconnected configuration is trivially twice of the half embedding case .",
    "the entanglement entropy as a function of strip width @xmath12 for @xmath116 .",
    "the dashed magenta and solid red curves come from the connected solutions , while the solid blue one comes from the disconnected one .",
    "the lowest curve is physically favored compared with others because it has minimal entropy . ]    we find the behaviors of the entanglement entropy as a function of the belt width @xmath12 are quite similar for various chemical potential @xmath11 or condensation @xmath117 .",
    "the result for @xmath116 is shown in figure   as a typical example .",
    "when @xmath118 , there does not exist connected surface .",
    "the physically favored solution is replaced by the trivial disconnected one in this case . on the other hand , when @xmath119 , we have three different branches of entropy for a given @xmath12 , i.e. , the upper connected branch ( dashed magenta curve ) , the lower connected branch ( solid red curve ) and the middle disconnected branch ( solid blue line ) . the physical entropy is determined by the choice of the lowest one . as we can see from figure  , for small @xmath12 , the lower connected branch is favored . however , there is a critical value @xmath120 above which the lower connected branch is not a physical one since its entropy is larger than the one for the disconnected solution .",
    "thus , when @xmath12 increases , a phase transition occurs as belt width @xmath121 .",
    "this is just the so - called  confinement / deconfinement \" phase transition discussed intensively in refs .",
    "the transition can be understood as the fact that no correlation could be contributed among a distance larger than @xmath69 due to the mass gap @xmath78 .",
    "the entanglement entropy as a function of belt width @xmath12 for different chemical potential @xmath11 .",

    "on the contrary , it is governed by the disconnected configuration and is independent of @xmath12 for @xmath123 .",
    "the fact that the phase transition always appears at critical length @xmath120 is observed for all values of @xmath11 matches the prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite that this  confinement / deconfinemnet \" phase transition must be exhibited in any consistent gravity dual of a confining theory .",
    "we find that @xmath124 and @xmath125 for various chemical potentials up to @xmath126 in our numerical calculation .",
    "if the belt width is large enough ( @xmath127 ) , the disconnected branch is always favored for all values of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the behavior of @xmath97 as a function of @xmath11 for fixed @xmath12 is the same as the one shown in figure  .",
    "it is helpful to slice the data in superconducting phase differently .",
    "we first study how the entropy of the system changes with chemical potential @xmath11 for fixing belt width @xmath12 , which is presented in the left plot of figure  .",
    "it can be seen clearly that the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential for fixed @xmath12 has similar behavior as in the half embedding case .",
    "in particular , the purple curve in the confined phase is the same as that in figure  , in which @xmath128 . as the chemical potential @xmath11 increases , the entropy first rises and reaches its maximum at a certain value of chemical potential denoted as @xmath129 ,",
    "then it decreases monotonously .",
    "the curve will flatten out as we decrease the belt width @xmath12 .",

    "the condensate emerges .",
    "thus , a new kind of charge carriers ( some quasi - particles like cooper pairs ) that can move unconstrained make contribution to the degrees of freedom , which leads to the increase of the entanglement entropy . when the chemical potential is enough large , however , all bounded carriers are condensed to form cooper pairs .",

    "the above argument may account for the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy in the insulator / superconductor phase transition .    to further understand the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy in the insulator / superconductor phase transition",
    ", it might be helpful to recall the microscopic model presented in @xcite , where the authors wanted to compare the holographic insulator / superconductor transition with high-@xmath99 cuprates , in particular with the rvb ( resonating valence bond ) scenario of high-@xmath99 electron doped cuprates ( e.g. , nd@xmath145ce@xmath146cuo@xmath147 ) .",
    "the phase diagrams for both systems are quite similar .",
    "the high-@xmath99 cuprate at @xmath148 ( in the under - doped region , here @xmath100 stands for the electron doping ) is the antiferromagnetic insulator . by doping holes ,",
    "one frustrates the antiferromagnetic order and eventually destroys it . beyond some critical doping @xmath149",
    ", the superconducting ground state emerges .",
    "the physics of the under - doped cuprates is well - described by the t - j model  @xcite . in the slave - boson ( su(2 ) slave - boson )",
    "approach , the electron operators can be decomposed into bosonic and fermionc parts , called holons and spinons , respectively . in the confined insulator phase",
    ", spinons and holons are completely glued together . at the beginning of phase transition ,",
    "the holons get condensed and the degrees of spinons might be released .",
    "this might be the reason that the entanglement entropy increases compared to the case in the insulator phase .",
    "when the electron doping continues to increase ( chemical potential gets large enough in the holographic insulator / superconudctor phase transition ) , the spinons will form cooper pairs and the degrees of freedom associated with spinons get condensed . in that case , the entanglement entropy of the system is even less than the case in the insulator phase .",
    "this model might explain the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy .",
    "but one caveat should be stressed here that in the gravity setup of the holographic insulator / superconductor model , an extra scalar field which is dual to the fermion bilinear in the field side does not included  @xcite .",
    "but one expects that including the extra scalar field to the model will not change the background geometry very much , so that the entanglement entropy keeps the same behavior . of course ,",
    "the above discussions are just some speculations , further more deep understanding for the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy is called for .",
    "by using entanglement entropy as a probe , in this paper , we investigated the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition in a five dimensional einstein - maxwell - complex scalar theory with a negative cosmological constant , we calculated the entanglement entropy of dual field theory with two kinds of geometry in the ads boundary : one is a half space , and the other is a belt geometry with width @xmath12 . in the former case , we found that there does exist a discontinuity of the slop of the entropy with respect to the chemical potential at the phase transition point .",
    "this discontinuity could be thought of as a significant reorganization of the degrees of freedom of the system and a signature of the phase transition . beyond the critical chemical potential",
    ", we found that the entanglement entropy is not monotonic in the superconductor phase : at the beginning of the transition , the entropy increases and arrives at its maximum at a certain chemical potential , and then decreases monotonically .    in the belt geometry case , the so - called  confinement / deconfinement phase transition \" happens in both the insulator and superconductor phases . as @xmath122",
    "the connected surface is favored and the entropy depends on belt width @xmath12 non - trivially , while as @xmath123 the disconnected surface is favored and the entropy is @xmath12 independent .",
    "the results enhance the prediction made in ref .",
    "@xcite that this phase transition must happen in any consistent gravity dual of a confining theory .",
    "thus , as a result , there do exist four different  phases \" characterized by chemical potential @xmath11 and belt width @xmath12 , in the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition .",
    "the complete  phase diagram \" is drawn in figure  .    we observed the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy with respect to the chemical potential @xmath11 in both the  confinement / deconfinement superconductor phases .",
    "the entanglement entropy firstly rises and reaches its maximum at a certain chemical potential and then decreases monotonically ( see figure ( [ halfen ] ) and figure  ) .",
    "although the entanglement entropy and entropic c - function depend on the belt width , it does not play any essential role in the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy could be thought of as a key characteristic of difference between the holographic insulator / superconductor transition and the metal / superconductor transition . in the latter case ,",
    "the entanglement entropy as a function of temperature near the critical transition point always monotonically decreases as temperature is lowered  @xcite .",
    "clearly it would be of some interest to check whether the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy is universal in other holographic insulator / superconductor model , for example , the p - wave case  @xcite .",
    "in addition it is worth stressing here that we did not have a clear microscopic interpretation for the non - monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy , but we did present some arguments which try to give a physical picture for this behavior . needless to say , it is quite necessary to deeply understand this behavior further .    in this paper",
    ", we have limited ourselves to the choice of parameters as @xmath54 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "note that the additional complications appear for sufficiently small charge @xmath83 .",
    "it is worthy studying the cases with other ( @xmath150 ) s and the case at finite temperature .",
    "it is also interesting to study entanglement entropy in other holographic superconductor models , such as the holographic p - wave superconductor  @xcite .",
    "what s more , it is of some interest to see the effect on the entanglement entropy of the magnetic field in the holographic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "we will leave them for future studies .",
