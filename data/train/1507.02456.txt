    "in description logics ( dls ) a concrete domain is a construct that can be used to define new classes by specifying restrictions on attributes that have literal values ( as opposed to relationships to other concepts ) .",
    "practical applications of dls usually require concrete properties with values from a fixed domain , such as strings or integers , supporting built - in predicates . for dls that are extended with concrete domains",
    ", there exist partial functions mapping objects of the abstract domain to values of the concrete domain , and can be used for building complex concepts .",
    "concrete domains can be used to construct complex concepts as for instance , the axiom @xmath2 defines a teenager as a person whose age is at least 13 and at most 19 . in dls , concrete domains are also known as _",
    "datatypes_. several probabilistic extensions of dls opt to exclude datatypes while , in fact , it is an essential feature as several knowledge extraction tools produce weighted rules or axioms that contain concrete data values .",
    "reasoning over these data either to infer new knowledge or to verify correctness is indispensable .",
    "additionally , recent advances in information extraction have paved the way for the automatic construction and growth of large , semantic knowledge bases from different sources .",
    "however , the very nature of these extraction techniques entails that the resulting knowledge bases may contain a significant amount of incorrect , incomplete , or even inconsistent ( i.e. , uncertain ) knowledge , which makes efficient reasoning and query answering over this kind of uncertain data a challenge . to address these issues ,",
    "there exist ongoing studies on probabilistic knowledge bases .",
    "the study of extending dls to handle uncertainty and vagueness has gained momentum recently . there have been several proposals to add probabilities to various dls .",
    "probabilistic dls can be classified in several dimensions .",
    "one possible classification is on the reasoning mechanism used : markov logic networks ( mlns ) , bayesian networks , and probabilistic reasoning .",
    "there exist some studies that employ mlns to extend various dls .",
    "the study in @xcite extends @xmath1 with probabilistic uncertainty based on the annotation of axioms using mlns .",
    "the main focus of this work is ranking queries in descending order of probability of atomic inferences which is different from the objective of this paper .",
    "another study in @xcite , presents a probabilistic extension of the dl @xmath1 without nominals and concrete domains in mln in order to find the most probable coherent ontology . in doing so",
    ", they have developed a reasoner for probabilistic owl - el called elog @xcite . in this study , we extend this work in order to deal with concrete domains in addition to nominals and instances . in databases",
    ", mlns have been used to create a probabilistic datalog called datalog@xmath3 .",
    "it is an extension of datalog that allows to express ontological axioms by using rule - based constraints @xcite .",
    "the probabilistic extension of datalog@xmath3 uses mlns as the underlying probabilistic semantics .",
    "the focus of this work is on scalable threshold query answering which is different from that of this work .",
    "other literatures extend dls with bayesian networks .",
    "some notable works include : an extension of @xmath4 with bayesian networks called @xmath5 is presented in @xcite .",
    "they study the complexity of reasoning under @xmath5 to show that reasoning is intractable .",
    "however , their work does not discuss probabilities in the abox and concrete domains are excluded . on the other hand , in @xcite , they added uncertainty to dl - lite based on bayesian networks . additionally , they have shown that satisfiability test and query answering in probabilistic dl - lite can be reduced to satisfiability test and query answering in the dl - lite family .",
    "further , it is proved that satisfiability checking and union of conjunctive query answering can be done in logspace in the data complexity .",
    "consequently , as discussed above , most of the studies that involve extending description logics to deal with uncertainty by using either bayesian or mlns often excluded concrete domains .",
    "this is partly due to either the lack of supporting features or the difficulty in dealing with them . in this paper",
    ", we study a novel way of dealing with uncertainty involving concrete domains .",
