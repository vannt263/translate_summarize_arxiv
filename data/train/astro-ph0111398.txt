    "even the grandest of grand - design spiral galaxies abound with substructure overlying and interlaced with the dominant twin - armed global pattern .",
    "this substructure may take the form of feathering between the main arms , or of spurs or larger branches jutting nearly perpendicularly from the primary arms , then sweeping back in the same sense at larger radii ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondary structures often appear in combination ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and are sometimes associated with chains of interarm regions @xcite .",
    "these intermediate - scale features occur in multiple - armed spirals as well as grand design types , but blend more unobtrusively into the complex overall structure .",
    "even at quite small ( circumnuclear ) scales , special image processing techniques can reveal regular substructure in spiral arms @xcite . from morphological evidence in multiple colors combined with kinematic arguments",
    ", @xcite concluded that many spurs represent long - lived wavelike phenomena .",
    "although spurs have long been recognized as characteristic features from ground - based studies , the higher resolution afforded by space - based platforms opens possibilities for observing these structures in exquisite and unprecedented detail .",
    "in particular , the recently - released hubble heritage image of the whirlpool galaxy m51 @xcite stunningly reveals that spurs project , at quasi - regular intervals , from essentially the whole length of the two main arms .",
    "these spurs are defined by narrow dust lanes , and are dotted with regions both near the main arms and well into the interarm regions .",
    "what is the origin of all these feathers , spurs , and branches ?",
    "do they represent a stochastic , localized phenomenon , or does the global spiral pattern play a role in their formation ?",
    "small - scale , irregularly - oriented and -separated feathering could in principle arise in many ways .",
    "proposals include gravitational induction of quasi - steady trailing responses to orbiting local mass condensations @xcite , transient swing amplification of `` shearing bits and pieces '' from a near - uniform interarm background @xcite , shocking of the interstellar medium ( ism ) produced by ballistic clouds traversing spiral arms @xcite , and percolation in a shearing environment of self - propagating star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "large - scale interarm branches that lie in relative radial isolation could be associated with ultraharmonic resonances of the primary pattern s potential @xcite .",
    "in addition to structural features for which the large - scale spiral pattern is irrelevant , and those for which it is crucial ( via a resonance ) , there may be features that are organized in a spatially - coherent plan by the spiral arms , yet which develop similarly to local , self - gravitating , shearing wavelets .",
    "we believe that the spurs recently observed in m51 ( and likely to show themselves in other galaxies upon high - resolution examination ) represent this sort of hybrid phenomenon .",
    "the idea that spiral arms may trigger the growth of smaller - scale , self - gravitating structures  particularly in the gaseous medium  is long established , and supported by both observational and theoretical studies .",
    "observational evidence includes the consistency with characteristic jeans - unstable values of observed masses and separations of superclouds @xcite and giant molecular associations @xcite .",
    "in addition , regions and star complexes are often distributed along arms in a `` beads on a string '' pattern , with a separation of roughly 3 times ( @xmath3 kpc ) the full arm thickness , independent of pitch angle and galactocentric radius @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that this spacing of giant regions is attributable to gravitational collapse of _ magnetized _ gas within spiral arms .",
    "an origin of spur formation with gravitational instability in spiral arms is natural because it relies only upon the fundamental physical agents known to be present : galactic differential rotation , compression by the spiral pattern , and self - gravity ; we shall show that well - developed spurs may require magnetic fields as well . two barriers to gas condensations on a large scale are insufficient surface density and excessive shear ; because both of these impediments are reduced simultaneously in spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , these regions are prone to self - gravitating instabilities that can produce nonaxisymmetric structure .",
    "condensations may also grow inside spiral arms under the combined action of the parker and gravitational instabilities , subsequently being carried downstream by galactic differential rotation to appear as spurs . in this paper , however , we isolate and concentrate only on local gravitational instability occurring in two - dimensional ( 2d ) , razor - thin disks ; the effects of the parker instability will be studied in future work .",
    "several previous studies have considered self - gravitating growth of perturbations within spiral arms in the _ linear _ regime .",
    "@xcite analyzed local stability of quasi - axisymmetric disturbances ( i.e.  @xmath4 perpendicular to the local spiral arm ) , and showed that in the linear regime growth is intrinsically transient , stabilized by the expanding , shearing flow as the medium leaves the arm region .",
    "* hereafter b88 ) analyzed local amplification of shearing wavelets with arbitrary initial local wavenumber , allowing for a varying background shear profile self - consistent with the varying ism compression in the arm / interarm regions .",
    "@xcite incorporated effects of magnetic fields in a wkb analysis of instantaneous growth in a spiral arm region , without explicitly taking into account the expansion and varying shear flow downstream ( relevant to the swing mechanism ; see b88 ) .    of previous work ,",
    "the most detailed study relevant to the problem of spiral arm spur formation is that of b88 .",
    "he showed that transient gravitational instabilities within compressed regions have two preferred directions for initial wavenumbers : nearly parallel and nearly perpendicular to the arm .",
    "he also suggested that closely - spaced periodic spurs may naturally develop from the former , while the latter could produce ( non - periodic ) spurs under certain conditions for the background velocity field .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate _ nonlinear _ evolution of local self - gravitating perturbations in the magnetized , gaseous ism as they interact with the spiral potential in a differentially - rotating galaxy .",
    "our study extends the work of b88 by including the effects of magnetic fields and nonlinearity .",
    "it extends our own previous nonlinear study of self - gravitating evolution in shearing , magnetized , featureless disks @xcite to incorporate the strong density and velocity gradients in the equilibrium gas profile driven by a stellar spiral arm potential . for thin , featureless disks ,",
    "there are two different mechanisms that grow density structure : the magneto - jeans instability when shear is weak or magnetic fields are strong ; and the magnetically - modified swing amplifier when shear is strong and the magnetic field is moderate or weak . here , we study the modifications of these mechanisms by the presence of the spiral arm .",
    "we proceed technically by considering a local patch of an infinitesimally thin gaseous disk subject to an external ( stellar plus dark matter ) potential .",
    "the model disk is assumed to be isothermal and initially magnetized parallel to the spiral arms .",
    "we adopt @xcite s coordinate system having two orthogonal axes parallel and perpendicular to the gradient in the local external spiral potential .",
    "we first obtain one - dimensional ( 1d ) density and velocity profiles with variation only in the direction perpendicular to the arm .",
    "we then apply small perturbations and follow their development with 2d direct numerical simulation . for comparison with these simulations",
    ", we also integrate the magnetized equivalent of the linear shearing - wavelet equations of b88 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we introduce the roberts coordinate system , present the vertically integrated , 2d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in these spiral - arm coordinates , and describe our simulation model parameters and numerical method . in  3 ,",
    "we pursue 1d spiral shock equilibria under the given background conditions , and study quasi - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "we present in  4 a set of mhd simulations with zero , sub - equipartition , and equipartition magnetic fields , to explore 2d structure formation .",
    "we analyze density and velocity structures of the spurs that we find form , and compare these structures with analytic predictions .",
    "we present density snapshots from late stages of evolution for several models , showing that spurs frequently fragment to produce dense knots with masses comparable to giant clouds or massive young stellar associations .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the conclusion of present work in  5 . in appendix",

    "we study the nonlinear response of a self - gravitating , magnetized , differentially rotating , razor - thin , gaseous disk to an externally - imposed spiral potential .",

    "the induced radial velocities are generally only a few percent of @xmath10 , but enough to compress gas into a highly nonlinear state .",
    "we investigate the gravitational instabilities that may develop in these highly - compressed spiral - arm regions .",
    "following @xcite and b88 , we construct a local cartesian frame whose center lies at a galactocentric distance @xmath11 and rotates at @xmath6 about the galactic center .",
    "the two coordinates correspond to radial @xmath12 and angular ( @xmath13 ) displacements with respect to the center of our moving frame .",
    "we then tilt our frame by an angle @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the directions perpendicular and parallel to the local spiral arm , respectively , and consider a local rectangular box with size @xmath17 , as depicted in figure [ arm_coord ] .",

    "h2 and h3 , with a realistic arm - interarm contrast in surface density of @xmath156 and 11.5 , respectively , the nonaxisymmetric growth of density is so mild that no gravitationally bound structure forms within the simulation interval .",
    "the two main mechanisms that can produce local growth of perturbations in unmagnetized , razor - thin disks are quasi - axisymmetric instability and swing amplification ( see b88 , who refers to the quasi - axisymmetric modes as jeans instability ) .",
    "since our chosen initial conditions for nonaxisymmetric simulations are already stable to 1d quasi - axisymmetric instability , one can only expect perturbations to grow as wave crests swing from leading to trailing configurations .",
    "figures [ hdevol]@xmath97 shows that swing amplification in models h2 and h3 is in fact very weak , producing only small - amplitude fluctuations in the density .",
    "this is because the high density compression in spiral arm regions produces reversed shear ( see eq .  [ [ loc_shear ] ] with @xmath114 and figs .",
    "[ 1dshock10]@xmath115 , [ 1dshock1]@xmath115 ) under which condition classical swing amplification is essentially shut off .",
    "another viable mechanism within spiral arms is _ divergence _ swing amplification that allows growth of leading wavelets in expanding background flows ( b88 ) .",
    "it is , however , very difficult to supply leading perturbations to spiral arms in a natural way , because the perturbations carried in from interarm regions are preferentially trailing . in interarm regions where @xmath157 so background shear is in the same sense as epicyclic motion , on the other hand",
    ", @xmath123 is high enough to suppress the classical swing mechanism .",
    "for example , model h3 has @xmath158 at @xmath159 .    because of its smaller @xmath74 and flatter density distribution , model h1 experiences stronger swing amplification than models h2 and h3 . with smaller @xmath81 , self - gravity smears out the spiral shock and makes the equilibrium profile more symmetric .",
    "lower @xmath160 implies the sense of shear is `` normal '' in the major portion of a disk .",
    "still , as can be seen in figure [ hdevol]@xmath97 , growth of perturbations occurs so slowly that it requires four successive passages through spiral arm regions to amplify them significantly .",
    "had we begun the evolution with higher perturbation amplitudes , less time would be required to attain a fully nonlinear state . as a result of swing amplification ,",
    "model h1 forms three ( weak ) spurs in the direction perpendicular to the spiral arm , with an average separation of @xmath161 kpc . when allowed to evolve further , they fragment and collapse .    the spurs that form in model h1 are shown in figure [ hdimage ] , where we plot the density at @xmath162 , and for comparison the density in the stable model h3 at @xmath163 . warped by the nonlinear background shear and expansion flow off the arm ,",
    "the local wavefronts defining the spurs in model h1 are well described by the kinematic formula provided by b88 .",
    "namely , the local tangent to the wavefront is given by @xmath164 with @xmath165,\\ ] ] where @xmath166 is the local surface density expansion factor , @xmath167 is a dimensionless elapsed time that is measured from the shock location ( or density peak ) , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , where @xmath143 is the spur spacing , and @xmath170 is the local @xmath45-wavenumber at @xmath171 .",
    "the function @xmath172 is defined in terms of the unperturbed state . from mass conservation , we can write the time element in terms of the expansion factor @xmath173 as @xmath174 so that @xmath172 only depends on the variation of surface density with @xmath45 via @xmath175 . using equation ( [ tele ] ) , one can show that the second term in the square brackets in equation ( [ wfront ] ) is directly proportional to @xmath176 ; the first term , from the definition of @xmath177 , equals @xmath178 .",
    "the curves whose local gradient is defined by @xmath179 with @xmath180 are overlaid on the spurs in figure [ hdimage ] , showing excellent agreement with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "our numerical evidence of the relative stability of purely hydrodynamic systems to nonaxisymmetric perturbations might seem in conflict with b88 s conclusion from linear theory that nonaxisymmetric wavelets can grow rapidly within @xmath181 orbital times .",
    "in fact , our results are entirely consistent with the predictions of b88 s general framework , but our numerical models explore a different part of the parameter space of background conditions  especially @xmath0  from that explored by b88 .",
    "in particular , b88 considered a very soft polytropic equation of state ( @xmath182 ) , such that he could easily achieve @xmath183 from solar neighborhood conditions , while our isothermal ( @xmath184 ) models have @xmath185 as table [ tbl-1 ] indicates .",
    "as figure 5 in b88 shows , amplification factors are very sensitive to @xmath0 , dropping by about one order of magnitude as @xmath0 increases from 0.52 to 0.67 .",
    "naive extrapolation of this result suggests that models with @xmath185 may remain stable ; we have indeed verified that the solutions of the corresponding linear equations ( see appendix a for magnetized versions ) show very low amplifications for our background models . because our 2d simulations require an initial equilibrium profile ( rather than an arbitrary shape for the surface density , as is permissible for linear analyses ) , and because such 1d equilibria do not exist for very small @xmath0 , our 2d simulations do not cover the parts of parameter space in which @xmath0 is small studied by b88 .",
    "our hydrodynamic models are by no means exhaustive , and the uncertainties in defining a realistic background model leave open many possibilities .",
    "nevertheless , both the models shown here and others we have studied support the conclusion that without magnetic effects , it is difficult to form large - scale spur - like structures in a gaseous arm that is not violently unstable to quasi - axisymmetric modes , and hence unlikely to represent a realistic equilibrium in the first place .      for simulations with mean magnetic field strength below thermal equipartition",
    ", we select three @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath186 ) models that are stable to quasi - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the critical @xmath74 values for @xmath90 are 1.58 , 1.78 , and 1.89 , for @xmath155% , 2% , and 3% , respectively .",
    "figure [ mhd10evol ] shows the initial density distributions and the evolution of maximum surface densities for model ms1@xmath84ms3 .",
    "compared to figure [ hdevol ] , figure [ mhd10evol ] demonstrates magnetic destabilization of modes with @xmath4 along the arm : perturbations in all three models grow very rapidly , leading to the formation of spurs that will eventually fragment and collapse .",
    "this destabilization in spiral arms may be understood in relationship to the nonaxisymmetric instabilities present in shearing , featureless disks .",
    "in addition to swing amplification , for which magnetic fields play a stabilizing role , magnetized thin disks are also subject to magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) , in which tension forces from embedded magnetic fields resist the stabilizing coriolis force @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the mji depends on the local field strength and the local shear rate . even with weak magnetic fields , significant growth of perturbations",
    "can occur , provided that their azimuthal wavelength is less than the local jeans wavelength and the local shear rate is not too large ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "although swing amplification may also contribute at a lower level , background spiral - arm conditions in models ms2 and ms3 provide fertile ground for growth of the mji , such that the models evolve quickly into self - gravitational runaway , within 2 orbits .",
    "the evolution of model ms1 is similar to that of h1 , in which perturbations grow primarily via swing amplification , although magnetic fields and stronger gravity expedite the instability in ms1 .    in figure [ mhd10pat]@xmath94",
    ", we plot a snapshot of model ms3 at @xmath187 in the frame comoving with the spiral pattern ( that is , the frame of the simulation ) .",
    "surface density in logarithmic color scale shows the structure of spurs forming almost perpendicularly to the shock , with an average spacing of @xmath188 .",
    "the velocity field clearly shows the background shear of galactic rotation across the box , the streaming motion of fluid elements within the arm , and the reversal of shear in the region of high density compression . since it amounts to only @xmath189 of the amplitude of background velocity , however , the perturbed velocity associated with spur formation is difficult to see in this representation .",
    "the spurs move in the @xmath46-direction with @xmath190 with respect to the global spiral pattern , which implies that they follow the background galactic rotation very closely ( since @xmath191 ) . to see the shape of spurs clearly",
    ", we transform to a frame in which spurs remain stationary and the left @xmath45-boundary corresponds to the initial shock front location .",
    "the evolved density structure ( color scale ) and streamlines ( dotted lines ) in this frame are shown in figure [ mhd10pat]@xmath97 .",
    "we also show the wavefront formed by spurs ( solid line ) drawn from equation ( [ wfront ] ) , with @xmath192 chosen to match the shape of spurs . note that except in the region very close to the shock front , the streamlines in the stationary - spur frame follow the kinematic wavefronts of spurs fairly well .",
    "figure [ mhd10image ] displays snapshots of density and field configurations of models ms1 at @xmath163 and ms2 at @xmath193 .",
    "the late - stage evolution of ms3 is similar to that of ms2 .",
    "our simulation resolution is insufficient to follow the evolution of these models further .",
    "when spurs reach high enough density , they begin to fragment along their length .",
    "each of these fragments has an average mass of about 2.0% and 1.5% of the total for models ms1 and ms2 , respectively , which correspond to @xmath194 .",
    "notice that this clump mass is roughly equal to the local jeans mass , @xmath195 , at the spiral arm density peak @xmath196 from table [ tbl-1 ] , one can see that @xmath195 ranges @xmath197 for our magnetized models .",
    "since the spur spacing is @xmath198 , and the surface density has large gradients across the arm width of @xmath199 , one should however not think of the clumps as being gathered isotropically from uniform density regions .",
    "some fragmentation occurs within the spiral arm ( and fragments subsequently climb out of the potential well ) , while some fragments that form off the arm are rapidly carried away deep into the interarm region .",
    "although the mass conversion efficiency in clustered star formation is uncertain , the collapsing fragments of our models may represent the entities that develop into prominent regions , as observed in both arm and interarm locations in spiral galaxies . note that as table [ tbl-1 ] lists , the spacing along the arm of spurs in models ms2 and ms3 are about @xmath200 times the arm width , which is consistent with observed separation of regions and star complexes in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure [ mhd1evol ] shows the initial density distributions and the evolution of maximum surface densities for mhd simulations with @xmath121 ( i.e. , @xmath201 ) . since magnetic fields exert pressure as if they were adiabatic gas with an `` effective '' index of two for one - dimensional compression ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , they potentially can reduce the density compression greatly even in an isothermal shock . the maximum densities in the resulting steady - state shock profiles in models me1@xmath84me4 are less than 3 , and the maximum to minimum density ratios are smaller than 6 as well .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath202 is @xmath203 . with the corresponding values @xmath204 for the existence of equilibrium configurations , the chosen models having @xmath205 are quite far from the margins of susceptibility for quasi - axisymmetric instability .",

    "figure [ mhd1pat]@xmath94 clearly shows that nine spurs , whose density is displayed in logarithmic color scale , grow out of the spiral arm .",
    "velocity vectors measured in the spiral arm frame show the background shear , reversed shear , and streaming motions associated with passage through the spiral arm , but as for model ms3 ( fig .",
    "[ mhd10pat]@xmath94 ) they do not readily evidence the perturbed velocity components that create spurs .",

    "imagine a spiral galaxy whose local disk can be identified with model me3 at @xmath207 .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to be inclined arbitrarily by 50 degrees with respect to the plane of sky . for fictitious observations , we select two viewing angles : parallel to the spiral arm and 40 degrees off the arm . in both cases ,",
    "the target areas are rotating away from the observer . the resulting line - of - sight velocities ( color scale ) and `` deprojected '' column density ( contours )",
    "are presented , respectively , in figures [ mhd1pat]@xmath115 and [ mhd1pat]@xmath105 .",
    "the numbers in the color bars are in the units of km s@xmath215 . when viewed along the spiral arm , the line - of - sight velocity is equal to @xmath216 ( where @xmath217 is the angle of the disk plane with respect to the plane - of - sky ) . with this observer position angle ,",
    "the signature of nonuniform streaming motions influenced by the external potential is evident , as manifested by the small change in color gradient across the arm in figure [ mhd1pat]@xmath115 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity has no discontinuities in this case . when the line - of - sight is oblique to the arm , on the other hand , the line - of - sight velocity is a mixture of the velocities both parallel and perpendicular to the arm . correspondingly , the signature of parallel streaming motion in the line - of - sight velocity is suppressed relative to the signature of the large discontinuity in @xmath101 across the shock , as shown in figure [ mhd1pat]@xmath105 . a careful examination of figures [ mhd1pat]@xmath115 and [ mhd1pat]@xmath105 reveals that the line - of - sight velocity is correlated with spurs , with high - density regions having negative gradients in the velocity ( @xmath218 ) , indicative of converging flow . the amplitude of the variation in the line - of - sight velocity along the arm is typically @xmath219 km s@xmath215 in the spur regions , which is almost comparable to the variation of streaming motion ( i.e. , shear in @xmath45 of @xmath220 ) in the arm .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the primary mechanism for structure formation in @xmath121 models is the mji , in which threaded near - azimuthal magnetic fields transport angular momentum out of growing perturbations .",
    "time evolution of the linear mji in a disk with uniform density , uniform magnetic fields , and normal linear shear has been studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and very recently by @xcite  in which nonlinear evolution was also studied . in previous works , however , the effects of varying shear and background compression and expansion across a spiral shock were not taken into account . because of the evidence from our simulations of the importance of mjis , it is valuable to generalize the analytical work of b88 on hydrodynamical self - gravitating instabilities in spiral arms to include magnetic effects .",
    "this will enable us to make direct comparisons between the linear evolution of mjis in non - uniform media and the results of our numerical simulations .    in appendix",
    "a , we present the linearly perturbed mhd equations in the lagrangian frame moving with the unperturbed background flow through a spiral arm . in order to integrate the governing set of equations , we need to prescribe an equilibrium density configuration . for an exemplary run , we adopt that of model me3 ( with @xmath92 , @xmath121 , and @xmath91 ) as shown in figure [ 1dshock1 ] .",
    "just as in b88 , we follow the growth of a disturbance assumed to maintain phases of an initial locally plane - wave form @xmath221 , where @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the initial position of a fluid element .",
    "we are free to choose @xmath224 and @xmath225 of any input perturbations .",
    "taking @xmath226 and @xmath227 as initial conditions at the shock front , and varying @xmath224 and @xmath225 , we directly integrate equations ( [ ppcon])@xmath84([ppind ] ) over time . for a given wavelet",
    ", we measure the total amplification factor and the time @xmath228 when maximum amplification occurs , and plot these values in figure [ mhd_con ] as solid and dotted contours , respectively .",
    "overall , modes with @xmath229 are favored for growth , in sharp contrast to mjis in a uniform medium where dominant modes have @xmath230 .",
    "this is because @xmath146 used in the definition of @xmath225 is in fact the maximum possible value in the medium .",
    "the value of @xmath231 averaged over the arm is lower , rendering the `` average '' value of @xmath232 larger than @xmath233 .",
    "since mjis generally require the wavenumber of perturbations to be less than the local jeans wavenumber for instantaneous growth , the total amplification factor depends on how long the kinematics of the background flow can keep @xmath234 small such that @xmath235 is smaller than the local @xmath236 ( which itself decreases as the surface density drops outside the spiral arm ) .",
    "while @xmath234 is a linearly increasing function of time in a normal , uniform - shear case , the evolution of @xmath234 in the spiral arm is not generally monotonic , determined instead by equation ( [ wfront ] ) .",
    "it turns out , as figure [ mhd_con ] shows , that the mjis associated with the spiral arm prefer wavelets that are initially slightly trailing at the shock front ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "this is because the shear reversal inside the spiral arm produces an interval in which @xmath234 initially decreases , followed by the return of normal shear downstream which then increases @xmath234 .",
    "the expansion effect also tends to reduce @xmath234 if it is initially positive . starting a wavelet as trailing thereby extends the time span during which mjis operate efficiently , and thus yields maximum amplification .    in figure",
    "[ mhd_con ] , we also indicate the parameters ( @xmath238 and @xmath212 ) determined from the numerical simulation for model me3 ( see fig .",
    "[ mhd1pat ] ) as a rectangular box . the ambiguities in determining @xmath239 from an _ integral _ number of spurs and in finding @xmath224 that gives the best fit for the shape of spurs are represented by the box size .",
    "the corresponding amplification factor and growth time from the linear - theory integration are @xmath240 and @xmath241 , respectively . while the largest predicted linear amplification available for the system is attained at the same @xmath212 , but at a larger length scale with @xmath242",
    ", this mode ( having @xmath243 ) would take longer to achieve the maximum growth .",
    "it appears that the nonlinear system `` compromises '' between maximum amplification and earliest growth , in selecting the mode that dominates the evolved state of the simulation .    in figure",
    "[ bc_comp ] , we compare the variation in the perturbed surface density distribution within the spurs with the prediction of amplification from the linear analysis . in doing this , we use the equivalence between the spatial variable @xmath45 in the simulation and the lagrangian distance traveled downstream by a fluid element in the background state , in the linear analysis .",
    "linear evolution of the perturbed surface density with @xmath238 and @xmath212 is plotted as a function of the dimensionless lagrangian time variable @xmath213 , and the corresponding downstream distance from the shock front .",
    "note that @xmath213 varies from 0 to @xmath244 for @xmath245 , corresponding to @xmath246 for two - armed spirals with @xmath247 .",
    "we select three prominent spurs in figure [ mhd1pat]@xmath97 and plot with various curves their perturbed surface densities measured along their length .",
    "although densities near the shock front fluctuate with small amplitudes due to the interactions with spurs trailing tails , the overall density distribution and the positions where spurs achieve maximum densities are in remarkably good agreement with the results of linear analysis .",
    "the growth of perturbations depends sensitively on @xmath74 .",
    "for instance , model me4 with @xmath248 takes about one more orbital time than model me3 with @xmath92 to be fully nonlinear , although initial density distributions are quite similar to each other ( see fig .  [ mhd1evol ] ) .",
    "this is not because the linear analysis for @xmath248 predicts a larger value of @xmath228 than for @xmath92 , but because the perturbations keep growing as they pass successively through spiral arms .",
    "as @xmath74 increases further , linear amplification factors become smaller , so that higher-@xmath74 models need even longer time for development .",
    "we found that a model with @xmath249 , and @xmath91 ( not listed in table [ tbl-1 ] ) becomes only moderately nonlinear at @xmath250 , while models with @xmath251 and the same @xmath80 and @xmath81 remain linear until the end of simulations ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "finally , figure [ mhd1image ] displays developing and fragmenting spurs for models me3 at @xmath253 and me4 at @xmath254 .",
    "the separation between two neighboring spurs is about @xmath255 kpc , which is very close to the most unstable jeans wavelength at the spiral density peak ( @xmath256 ; see table [ tbl-1 ] ) , showing that the stabilizing contribution from epicyclic motions is almost negligible when the magnetic field is strong .",
    "compared to @xmath90 models , spurs in the @xmath121 models are stronger and extend farther away from the spiral arm .",
    "fragmentation of spurs when the magnetic field is stronger thus occurs mostly in the interarm region . for these runs , we find that each collapsing fragment has an average mass of about 1.5% ( @xmath257 ) of the total mass , which is again very close to the local jeans mass @xmath195 at the peak density of spiral arms ( see eq .",
    "[ [ m_jsp ] ] and table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "one can not resist speculating that bright , interarm regions , as seen for example in the optical image of m51 , could have originated as condensations in spur structures very like those found by our simulations and analyses .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamical interaction of a magnetized , 2d shearing flow  representing a local patch of the height - integrated ism  with an external gravitational potential  representing a local portion of a spiral stellar arm .",
    "our primary interest was in exploring the ways in which self - gravity leads to growth of intermediate - scale structure , and how these intermediate - scale structures subsequently fragment .",
    "we show that in magnetized systems , the characteristic structures that grow are spur - like features that jut out at regular intervals from the spiral arms ; within these spurs , dense condensations may grow and travel out into the interarm region .",
    "the spur structures in our models bear remarkable resemblance to the conspicuous features branching out of spiral arms in recent high - resolution hst images of the whirlpool galaxy , and also apparent ( less spectacularly ) in other grand - design spirals .",
    "the technical centerpiece of our work is a set of time - dependent , numerical mhd simulations .",
    "the model disks are infinitesimally thin and maintain a constant isothermal sound speed @xmath38 . in the absence of stellar spiral - arm forcing , the disks are assumed to have uniform velocity shear , uniform surface density characterized by the toomre @xmath74 parameter ( see eq .",

    "we do not allow for spacetime variations of the magnetic scale height .",
    "in addition to its own self - gravity , the gaseous flow is subject to an explicitly - introduced sinusoidal external potential ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ ext_p ] ] and [ [ f_arm ] ] ) , modeling a local stellar spiral arm . the back reaction of stars to the gravitational field of gas is not , however , included in the present study .",
    "the spiral arm is assumed to be tightly wound and rigidly rotating at half the local orbital rate .",
    "we evolve the ideal mhd equations in the local frame comoving with the stellar arm , with two orthogonal axes corresponding to the directions perpendicular and parallel to the arm ( see @xcite ) .    imposing translational symmetry along the arm ,",
    "we first construct one - dimensional equilibrium spiral shock configurations and examine their stability to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "even if the spiral perturbation is only a tiny fraction of the background axisymmetric field , induced radial velocities are generally supersonic , easily forming a shock front .",
    "we find that larger amplitude background spiral arms ( larger @xmath81 ) result in stronger shocks , while the shock - forming tendency of gas decreases as the relative importance of self - gravity to spiral forcing increases ( cf .",
    "self - gravity enhances the arm - interarm density contrast , while magnetic pressure reduces it .",
    "when @xmath74 is sufficiently small , no equilibrium profiles can be found from our time - dependent integrations , because either the structures become gravitationally unstable ( when magnetic fields and/or stellar spiral perturbations are weak ) , or because the given background conditions and adopted spiral pattern speed do not allow stationary shocks to exist ( when fields and/or spiral arms are strong ) .",
    "critical values of @xmath123 at the density peak are found to be @xmath259 0.5 , and 0.4 for @xmath132 , 10 , and 1 , respectively .    for our two - dimensional simulations ,",
    "we start with one - dimensional equilibrium density profiles calculated as above , apply low - amplitude white - noise perturbations , and monitor their nonlinear growth .",
    "we find that gaseous spurs naturally form as a consequence of gravitational instabilities inside spiral arms with input modes having @xmath4 nearly along the spiral arms growing preferentially .",
    "the chief physical mechanism for spur formation is the magneto - jeans instability , in which the magnetic tension force breaks the loop of stabilizing epicyclic motions @xcite . although swing amplification can also play a role in forming spur structures when the magnetic field is weak and the arm - interarm density contrast is moderate , purely hydrodynamic systems that are stable to quasi - axisymmetric perturbations are generally also found to be stable to nonaxisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we thus suggest that magnetic effects are key for producing the gaseous spurs observed in real galaxies .",
    "when the mean magnetic field is in thermal equipartition ( @xmath121 ) , we find that the separation of spurs is more - or - less consistent with the most unstable jeans wavenumber at the density peak , while with a sub - equipartition magnetic field ( @xmath90 ) , the formation of spurs requires larger - scale perturbations to enhance self - gravity ( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the characteristic scale of spurs formed in our simulations is about @xmath260 ( or @xmath261 pc for our model parameters ) for the models that are unstable to the magneto - jeans instability , where @xmath262 is the local jeans wavelength at the spiral - arm density peak .",
    "the corresponding ratio of the spacing to the arm thickness is @xmath263 and 1.5 , respectively , for @xmath90 and 1 models .",

    "the shape of the spurs sculpted by the shearing and expanding background flow in our models is in excellent agreement with equation ( [ wfront ] ) , originally derived by b88 .",
    "reversed shear within the strongly compressed region tends to decrease the @xmath45-wavenumber of the perturbations , so that slightly trailing waves entering the spiral shock are preferred as having the longest growing phase under mjis .",
    "entering waves first shear around and expand to create nearly - radial wavefronts as they exit the arm . far into the interarm region , where shear returns to the `` normal '' ( slower - outside ) sense , the wavefronts become strongly trailing .    in the nonlinear stage of evolution , spurs experience fragmentation to form gravitationally bound clumps , the typical mass of which corresponds roughly to the local jeans mass at the density peak inside spiral arms ( or @xmath264 for our model parameters ) .",
    "the positions where the fragmentation occurs include interarm regions as well as within spiral arms themselves .",

    "given the nominally low surface density and high shear conditions in interarm regions , the presence of numerous interarm regions requires an explanation . from our model simulations",
    ", we suggest that massive self - gravitating clumps resulting from nonlinear fragmentation of spurs can develop in both arm and interarm regions .",
    "this implies that interarm star formation may be engendered by the same dynamical process , namely large - scale gravitational instabilities initiated in spiral arms , as arm star formation .",
    "indeed , there is no significant observational difference in the sizes and electron densities of the regions between spiral arm and interarm regions @xcite .",
    "the fact that the shape of spurs , reflecting the background flow characteristics , is well described by equation ( [ wfront ] ) may provide an independent way to determine global spiral pattern speeds .",
    "the pitch angle , angular velocity of galactic rotation , and epicyclic frequency are observable quantities , and @xmath239 can be determined from the mean separation of observed spurs .",
    "provided that the surface density distribution is known , therefore , @xmath170 and @xmath6 ( see eq .  [ [ tele ] ] ) can be determined simultaneously by finding a best fit of @xmath172 to the observed overall shape of spurs .",
    "if we can further constrain @xmath224 for example from the linear theory as the dominant mode , or from high resolution observations that allow determination of the slope of spurs near the density maximum ( @xmath273 ) , then @xmath6 can be uniquely determined .",
    "conversely , if we know the pattern speed by other means , equations ( [ wfront ] ) and ( [ tele ] ) can be used to predict the variation of surface density in spiral arms , as a consistency check of direct determinations .    for model simulations presented in this paper",
    ", we took a patch of a galactic disk inside the corotation radius of a steady spiral pattern , and showed that spurs jut outwards from the arms and become increasingly trailing at larger radii .",
    "we have also run spiral - arm interaction simulations for regions outside the pattern s corotation ( not listed in table [ tbl-1 ] ) and found that the induced spurs jut _ inwards _ from the local arm segments and become trailing at smaller radii .",
    "these morphological differences in spurs between inside and outside corotation could help to locate corotation radii of spiral patterns in spiral galaxies .",
    "the present lack of evidence for spurs on the insides of arms ( b.  elmegreen , personal communication ) could be because the arms are generally relatively weak outside corotation , or perhaps because resolution is insufficient .",
    "of course , it is possible that when other galaxies are observed at resolution comparable to the recent m51 image , and when larger areas are surveyed , inward - jutting spurs might be detected .      in this paper ,",
    "the 2d simulations of purely hydrodynamic flow passing through spiral arms show comparatively stable behavior , largely because the hydrodynamic models chosen for these runs have relatively large @xmath185 at the density peak .",
    "@xcite argued that for flows with pressure - density relation @xmath274 , the values of the toomre parameter at the point of maximum compression , @xmath275 , is the most important parameter for characterizing the system s gravitational response ( here @xmath67 and @xmath74 are the equivalent parameters for a uniform disk ) . since @xmath0 is the smallest local value in a non - uniform medium , @xmath134 does not always ensure quasi - axisymmetric instability will occur , because for local instability @xmath123 must be smaller than unity over at least a radial distance @xmath276 .",
    "our results for quasi - axisymmetric stability indicate that critical @xmath0 values are @xmath277 for unmagnetized cases ( see  3 and fig .",
    "[ qcrit ] ) .",
    "it seems that at least one additional parameter , @xmath144 , which describes arm width ( or the gradient in the background density profile ) , combines with @xmath0 to determine the system s response to two - dimensional ( spur - forming ) perturbations .",
    "for example , models h2 and h3 having smaller @xmath0 remain stable ( with fluctuating density ) , while model h1 with larger @xmath0 ( but smaller @xmath74 ) is subject to ( mild ) swing amplification . for a given @xmath0 , models with larger @xmath144  and thus a smaller arm - to - interarm density contrast and @xmath74",
    " are usually more susceptible to swing amplification . in part , this is because excessive compression in the spiral arm reverses the normal direction of shear ( see eq .",
    "[ [ loc_shear ] ] ) , which tends to suppress the swing mechanism .",
    "for wavelets that enter the spiral shock with leading orientation ( @xmath278 ) , b88 showed that the tendency for `` normal '' rotation of leading wavefronts driven by expansion ( see eq .  [ 3.15 ] of b88 ) can compensate somewhat for locally - reversed shear .",
    "we find that for cases where quasi - axisymmetric modes are stable , however , amplification from `` natural '' perturbations ( mostly trailing ) does not produce strong spurs in unmagnetized systems .    from b88 s results with @xmath182",
    ", @xmath279 appears to be required in order for _ nonaxisymmetric _ perturbations to grow significantly enough to form nonlinear structures . with a small value of @xmath280",
    ", moderate compression factors easily produce @xmath0 as low as 0.6 from mean ism conditions . however , _",
    "quasi - axisymmetric _ modes may be unstable as well when @xmath0 is very small . by adopting an isothermal equation of state ,",
    "we obtain larger values of @xmath0 for a given compression factor than with a softer pressure - density relation . in addition , because our 2d models are initiated with 1d profiles that are quasi - axisymmetrically stable , we were limited to a range of @xmath185 for our hydrodynamic models .",
    "although introduced to some extent to achieve numerical stability in our computations , the requirement of quasi - axisymmetric stability is likely to appear in nature as well .",
    "since we observe gaseous spiral arms and associated dust lanes in spiral galaxies , the compressed gaseous regions are probably quasi - axisymmetrically stable ; otherwise , these arms would not be long - lived  compressed gas would turn quickly into stars .",
    "the question , then , of whether spurs could form from purely hydrodynamic ( swing - like ) instabilities within arms is reduced to finding a self - consistent density distribution that is quasi - axisymmetrically stable yet with @xmath0 small enough for 2d instabilities to grow .",
    "the real ism is multiphase and turbulent , in which hot , warm , and cold phases coexist ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although optically thin gas can be described by polytropic relations between density and thermal pressure , this is only in a piecewise sense with a fairly uncertain @xmath280 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the turbulent motions of cold clouds , although often treated as an effective pressure , may actually have a rather different dynamical response to compression .",
    "a realistic assessment of hydrodynamic instabilities on spur and cloud formation , therefore , will require a more accurate treatment of the small - scale thermal and dynamical properties of the medium . an important direction for future research ,",
    "thus , will focus on determining whether better treatment of `` microphysics '' renders the purely - hydrodynamic ( swing ) mechanism competitive with the mhd mechanism ( mji ) for forming spurs and condensing clouds .    in the present paper ,",
    "we have studied the formation and fragmentation of spurs due to self - gravitating instabilities within spiral arms , with magnetic fields parallel to the galactic plane abetting the process .",
    "since they are restricted to a thin - disk geometry , the present models do not capture the potential dynamical consequences of magnetorotational instabilities ( mris ) and the parker instability in themselves or in connection to mjis .",
    "mris ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which exist only in 3d systems , are known to generate mhd turbulence , which may make an important contribution to the amplitude of ism random motions in galactic disks @xcite as well as exciting density perturbations , and may also provide angular momentum transport within disks  possibly affecting the growth of condensations .",
    "the @xcite instability has long been thought to be important in the formation of ob associations , giant regions , and giant molecular clouds along spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , because it is able to grow condensations at lateral wavelengths comparable to the disk scale height  as required for clouds of mass @xmath281 .",
    "recent numerical studies indicate that the parker instability _ alone _ can not be the main formation mechanism for giant clouds in general galactic disks , because the column density enhancement is only a factor of three ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the coupling of the parker instability with other dynamical processes could produce significant effects on structure formation in galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggested that nonlinear triggering of the parker instability by spiral shocks could enhance density enough to form giant cloud complexes , and the nonlinear simulations of @xcite ( neglecting shear ) evidence this sort of behavior .",
    "extension of the current work into three dimensions has the potential to show how `` seeds '' sown by the parker and/or mri modes in spiral arms may grow and condense into self - gravitating giant molecular clouds .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge stimulating conversations and communications with b.  elmegreen , j.  stone , s.  vogel , f.  shu , n.  scoville , and k.  sheth .",
    "we are also grateful to an anonymous referee for constructive comments .",
    "this work was supported by nasa grants nag 53840 and nag 59167 .",
    "in this appendix , we provide the perturbed equations to be integrated to obtain the linear - theory solutions shown in figures [ mhd_con ] and [ bc_comp ] .",
    "these solutions represent examples of the evolution of low - amplitude , nonaxisymmetric perturbations ( specifically , initial local plane waves ) in a magnetized , non - uniform disk , subject to a background flow containing compression and expansion , and varying shear , as imposed by the self - consistent equilibrium response to an external spiral potential .",
    "local dynamical instabilities in _ unmagnetized _ disks with similar background flow properties have been studied by @xcite for quasi - axisymmetric modes and by b88 for two - dimensional perturbations . here",
    ", we extend b88 s work to include the effect of magnetic fields .",
    "we begin by considering a steady - state equilibrium configuration represented by density @xmath26 , velocity @xmath282 , and magnetic field @xmath283 ( see for example  3 ) , in the spiral - arm coordinates built in  2.1 .",
    "the equilibrium is quasi - axisymmetric in the sense that flow quantities vary only along @xmath284 , the coordinate axis perpendicular to the arm , which lies at an angle @xmath14 with respect to the local radial direction . imposing small amplitude eulerian perturbations represented by @xmath44 , we linearize equations ( [ con])-([eos ] ) : @xmath285 @xmath286 @xmath287 @xmath288 @xmath289 where the lagrangian time derivative following the background flow is denoted by @xmath290 and the perturbed vector potential @xmath291 is defined through @xmath292 .",
    "following b88 , we now consider a lagrangian frame comoving with the background flow @xmath30 , allowing for the local normal or reversed shear and expansion velocity fields .",
    "the frame is initially located at the postshock density peak .",
    "we adopt the ansatz that an applied plane - wave disturbance locally preserves sinusoidal variations , so that the stability of a local patch can be assessed by following the temporal evolution of wavelets of arbitrary initial local @xmath293 . strictly speaking",
    ", this sort of analysis should be applied only when the initial wavelength is small compared to the width of the spiral arm .",
    "formally , however , we can choose @xmath293 freely . since the background variables are independent of @xmath46 , the @xmath46-wavenumber @xmath239 of the perturbations remains fixed throughout the linear evolution , but the @xmath45-wavenumber @xmath234 changes in response to the background flow .",
    "in particular , normal / reversed shear tends to increase / decrease @xmath234 , and expansion / contraction tends to decrease / increase @xmath294 .",
    "the net result of these various effects on the local value of @xmath234 was derived by b88 ; our equation ( [ wfront ] ) reproduces his formula for the local value of @xmath295 as a function of the elapsed time since entering the shock ( or , correspondingly the perpendicular @xmath45-distance traversed ) .    for consistency with other `` local '' simplifications",
    "we have made , we shall assume that spatial variations of the perturbed variables are much more rapid than those of the background state , so that we can ignore the last term in each of equations ( [ pcon])@xmath84([pmomy ] ) .",
    "the validity of this approximation can easily be demonstrated by computing @xmath296 ; if @xmath297 , we can safely ignore the terms containing the gradients of @xmath26 and @xmath298 in equations ( [ pcon])@xmath84([pmomy ] ) ( recall that @xmath299 from flux conservation ) .",
    "since @xmath300 , where @xmath144 is the arm width ( cf",
    ".  table [ tbl-1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath301 where @xmath302 , with the jeans wavenumber @xmath146 at the density peak defined by equation ( [ k_jsp ] ) . using the background parameters listed in table [ tbl-1 ] with the identification of @xmath303 , corresponding to the most unstable modes , we find @xmath304 for the @xmath121 models and @xmath305 for the @xmath90 models .",
    "this implies that the wkb approximation we make here is somewhat marginal for the @xmath121 models , and probably breaks down for the @xmath90 models .",
    "for this reason , we shall apply the results of the linear analysis only for the @xmath121 models , particularly model me3 .    defining the dimensionless variables , @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , and @xmath310 , and applying the wkb approximation ,",
    "we now rewrite equations ( [ pcon])-([ppos ] ) in dimensionless form ( omitting the tilde ) as @xmath311 @xmath312\\delta\\sigma - \\alpha \\beta_0^{-1 } \\sigma_{\\rm max } k_y^2 ( 1+\\mathcal{t}^2)\\delta m,\\ ] ] @xmath313\\delta\\sigma,\\ ] ] @xmath314 where @xmath315 , @xmath316 , and @xmath317 .    for temporal integrations of equations ( [ ppcon])@xmath84([ppind ] )",
    ", we need to specify @xmath318 and @xmath319 from a given background flow model : we adopt those of model me3 shown in figure [ 1dshock1 ] . for initial conditions , we take @xmath320 , and @xmath321 .",
