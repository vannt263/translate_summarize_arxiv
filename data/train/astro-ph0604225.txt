    "scalar fields are one of the key ingredients in modern cosmology .",
    "they play an important role during inflation and certain phase transitions ; they feature in the preheating and quintessence scenarios ; and they are pervasive in all sorts of alternative theories ( eg . string theory and scalar - tensor theory ) which are likely to be relevant in the high curvature phase of the early universe . in such scenarios ,",
    "it is often assumed that scalar fields dominated the energy of the universe at some stage of its evolution .",
    "this could have profound implications for the formation and evolution of any primordial black holes ( pbhs ) that may have formed in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "it would also modify the constraints on the number of pbhs provided by various observations  @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting example of this arises if the dark energy which generates the cosmic acceleration observed at the present epoch is associated with a quintessence field . in this context , it has recently been claimed  @xcite that pbhs could grow enough through accreting quintessence to provide seeds for the sort of supermassive black holes thought to reside in galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this claim is based on a simple newtonian analysis , in which a pbh with size comparable to the cosmological particle horizon appears to grow in a self - similar manner  @xcite , i.e. its size is always the same fraction of the size of the particle horizon .",
    "this suggests that pbhs may accrete surrounding mass very effectively if their initial size is fine - tuned .",
    "however , this analysis neglects the cosmological expansion  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a general relativistic analysis of this problem has been applied for a black hole accreting dark energy and phantom energy  @xcite , as well as a ghost condensate  @xcite . however , the cosmological expansion is still neglected in these analyses .    the possibility of spherically symmetric self - similar pbh solutions was first studied more than 30 years ago for a fluid with a radiation equation of state ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "this study was also prompted by the newtonian analysis and demonstrated analytically that there is no self - similar solution which contains a black hole attached to an exact friedmann background via a sonic point ( i.e. in which the black hole forms by purely causal processes ) .",
    "the newtonian analysis is therefore definitely misleading in this case .",
    "there are self - similar solutions which are _ asymptotically _ friedmann at large distances from the black hole",
    ". however , these correspond to special initial conditions , in which matter is effectively thrown into the black hole at every distance ; they do not contain a sonic point because they are supersonic everywhere .",
    "similar results were subsequently proved for all perfect fluid systems with equation of state of the form @xmath1 with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "indeed it was shown that the only physical self - similar solution which can be attached to an external friedmann solution via a sonic point is friedmann itself ; the other solutions either enter a negative mass regime or encounter another sonic point where the pressure gradient diverges  @xcite .",
    "later numerical relativistic calculations have confirmed that pbhs can not accrete much for these perfect fluid systems  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the asymptotically friedmann self - similar solutions with black holes are not strictly friedmann at infinity , because they exhibit a solid angle deficit which could in principle show up in the angular diameter test  @xcite .",
    "the limiting values of @xmath3 require special consideration . in the @xmath4 case",
    ", there is no sonic point , so the uniqueness is trivial ; again there are asymptotically friedmann self - similar solutions with pbhs but only for special initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "the stiff fluid case ( @xmath5 ) is more complicated and has an interesting history .",
    "it was originally claimed by lin et al .",
    "@xcite that there _ could _ exist a self - similar black hole solution in this case but subsequent calculations by bicknell and henriksen  @xcite showed that this solution does not contain a black hole after all because the alleged event horizon is timelike .",
    "the only way to avoid this conclusion would be if the fluid turned into null dust at this timelike surface , but this seems physically implausible .",
    "it therefore appears that there is no self - similar solution containing a black hole in an exact friedmann background for any value of @xmath3 in the range [ 0,1 ] .    in view of the prevalence of scalar fields in the early universe ,",
    "it is clearly important to know whether the non - existence of a self - similar solution extends to the scalar field case .",
    "one might expect this from the stiff fluid analysis , since a scalar field is equivalent to a stiff fluid provided the gradient is everywhere timelike  @xcite .",
    "this is supported by recent numerical studies of the growth of pbhs in a scalar field system , which - for a variety of initial conditions - give no evidence for self - similar growth  @xcite .",
    "however , it is very difficult to determine through numerical simulations whether self - similar growth is impossible for any specific initial data .",
    "one therefore needs an _",
    "analytic _ proof that there is no self - similar black hole solution if the cosmological expansion is taken into account .",
    "this paper presents such a proof and also provides the basis for studying the growth of black holes in an expanding universe containing more general matter fields .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the stiff fluid case , with particular emphasis on the earlier work of lin et al .",
    "@xcite and bicknell and henriksen  @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we consider the massless scalar field case , using brady s formulation of the self - similar equations as an autonomous system  @xcite and making a detailed comparison with the stiff fluid case .",
    "we prove that there is no self - similar solution unless the behaviour of the matter is very contrived . in section",
    "iv we extend the analysis to the case of a scalar field with an exponential potential ( as applies in the quintessence scenario ) and show that the proof applies in this case also .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section v. various technical issues are relegated to appendices , including a comparison with previous literature , a discussion of the global characteristics of these solutions , and an analysis of the behaviour of solutions at the similarity horizon .",
    "we use geometrised units with @xmath6 throughout this paper .",
    "first , we show how a stiff fluid description of a scalar field can give insight into the fluid - field correspondence for self - similar solutions  @xcite .",
    "a stiff fluid is a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath7 and stress - energy tensor @xmath8 if @xmath9 is vorticity - free , one can show that this matter field is equivalent to a massless scalar field @xmath10 , for which the stress - energy tensor is @xmath11 and the gradient @xmath12 is timelike .",

    "providing @xmath42 remains finite .",

    "this requires that the potential have a specific shape , which is not in fact of the form ( [ eq : potential ] ) required by self - similarity .",
