    "over the past decade considerable effort , both observational and theoretical , has been directed towards a more accurate determination of the stellar lower main sequence , down to the edge of the sub - stellar domain .",
    "such a determination bears important consequences for our understanding of a wide variety of astrophysical problems , from star formation and stellar structure to galactic formation and evolution .",
    "although the lower main sequence of the disk is relatively well determined since the survey of monet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , the situation is less well defined for the galactic halo , primarily because of the greater difficulties involved in identifying the halo stars .",
    "the task of detecting halo low - mass stars ( lms ) and measuring their magnitude is of formidable difficulty with ground - based telescopes .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) have always presented a particular interest for the study of the stellar halo since we can more easily determine their main sequence than for field halo stars .",
    "most of the observations of gcs focussed on the _ upper _ main sequence , i.e. the turn - off point , and the red giant branch , for a comparison of this region with theoretical isochrones yields a determination of the age of the clusters , and thus a lower - bound for the age of the galatic halo .",
    "thanks to the tremendous progress in deep photometry realized recently with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , which reaches unprecedented magnitude and spatial resolution , the lower main sequence of gcs is now observed nearly down to the hydrogen burning limit . thanks to the high angular resolution achievable with the hst , accurate photometry is feasible to levels about 4 magnitudes fainter than with ground - based observations , allowing photometry of very faint stars .",
    "several hst observations of globular clusters are now available , spanning a large metallicity - range from solar value to substantially metal - depleted abundances , as will be presented in the next section . the lower main sequence of these clusters is well defined and offers a unique possibility to probe low - mass star evolutionary models for various metallicities down to the hydrogen - burning limit .    in spite of considerable progress in stellar theory - internal structure , model atmospheres and evolution - all the lms models so far failed to reproduce accurately the observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of disk or halo stars below @xmath2 k , i.e. @xmath3 , depending on the metallicity .",
    "all the models predicted too hot an effective temperature for a given luminosity , i.e. were too blue compared to the observations by at least one magnitude ( see e.g. monet , 1992 ) .",
    "such a disagreement stemed essentially from shortcomings both in the physics of the interior , i.e. equation of state ( eos ) and thus mass - radius relationship and adiabatic gradient , and in the atmosphere , since all models were based on grey atmospheres and a diffusion approximation .",
    "important progress has been made recently in this field with the derivation of an appropriate eos for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( saumon , chabrier & van horn 1995 ; see chabrier and baraffe 1997 ) , non - grey model atmospheres for m - dwarfs ( allard and hauschildt 1995 , 1997 ; brett 1995 ) and evolutionary models based on a consistent treatment between the interior and the atmosphere profile ( baraffe , chabrier , allard & hauschildt 1995 ; chabrier , baraffe & plez 1996 ; chabrier & baraffe , 1997 ) .",
    "these models now reach quantitative agreement with the observations , as shown in the afore - mentioned papers and presented in  4 .",
    "globular clusters offer the great advantage of all stars having the same metallicity , determined relatively accurately from bright star spectroscopic measurements .",
    "moreover they are old enough for all the stars to have reached thermal equilibrium , so that age effects do not affect the luminosity of the objects near the bottom of the ms . for these reasons",
    ", the mass - luminosity relationship is well determined along the entire ms of gcs , from the turn - off down to the brown dwarf limit , with no dispersion due either to age or metallicity . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "these properties restrain appreciably the degrees of freedom in the parameter space , so that globular clusters provide a very stringent test to probe the validity of low - mass star evolutionary models and of the related mass - luminosity relationships for various metallicities .",
    "agreement between these models and observations is a _ necessary condition _ ( but not sufficient ! ) to assess the validity of these mass - luminosity relationships , a cornerstone to derive _ reliable _ mass - functions .    in this paper",
    ", we present new evolutionary models for metal - depleted ( @xmath4\\le -1 $ ] ) low - mass stars ( @xmath5 ) , based on the most recent non - grey model atmospheres .",
    "we compare the results with the observed cmds of three globular clusters , namely @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for which hst observations are available .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the observations are summarized in  2 whereas the theory is outlined in  3 , where comparison is made with other recent lms models .",
    "comparison between theory and observation is presented in  4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "the extension of the present calculations to more metal - rich clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 -0.5 ) and field stars , which require more extensive calculations , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( allard et al .",
    "1997b ) , as well as the derivation of the mass function for globular star clusters and halo field stars , from the observed luminosity functions ( chabrier & mra , 1997 ) .",
    "the decreasing luminosity of stars with mass ( @xmath10 for low - mass stars ) renders the observation of the lower main sequence almost impossible from ground - based telescopes . despite these difficulties ,",
    "a number of clusters have been investigated with large telescopes by several groups worldwide to determine the bottom of the main sequence . to our knowledge ,",
    "the most extensive study was conducted by richer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who determined accurately the ms of six gcs up to a magnitude @xmath11 , i.e. a mass @xmath12 .",
    "although intrinsically interesting , these observations do not provide any information about the very bottom of the ms , and the shape of the luminosity function near the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "moreover , for metal - depleted abundances , the afore - mentioned limit magnitude and mass correspond to a temperature @xmath13 k ( see  4 ) . above this temperature , the physics of the stellar interiors and atmospheres is relatively well mastered , so that these observations put little constraint on the models , and the related mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "a recent breakthrough in the field has been accomplished with the deep photometry of several gcs obtained with the refurbished space telescope .",
    "several observations are now available for @xmath6 ( paresce , demarchi & romaniello , 1995 ; cool , piotto & king , 1996 ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) ( demarchi & paresce 1995 ; piotto , cool & king , 1996 ) and @xmath16 ( elson , gilmore , santiago & casertano , s. , 1995 ) .",
    "observations for these clusters reach @xmath17 , @xmath18 , almost the very bottom of the main sequence , and thus provide a unique challenge to probe the validity of the lms models down to the brown dwarf regime",
    ".    @xmath19 _ metallicity_. all the afore - mentioned clusters are substantialy metal - depleted . before going any further",
    ", it is essential to define what we call `` metallicity '' in the present context , for different definitions are used in the literature .",
    "what is observed in globular clusters is the iron to hydrogen ratio @xmath20 .",
    "the continuous production of oxygen in type ii supernovae during the evolution of the galaxy has led to the well observed enhancement of the oxygen to iron @xmath21 $ ] abundance ratio in old metal - poor stars with respect to the young disk population .",
    "since our basic models assume a solar - mix composition , i.e. @xmath22=0 $ ] , the afore - mentioned oxygen - enhancement must be taken into account to make consistent comparison between theory and observation .",
    "we use the prescription derived by ryan and norris ( 1991 ) for halo subdwarfs , i.e.    @xmath23 = [ o / fe]\\,+\\ , \\feh \\eqno(1)\\ ] ]    with    @xmath24\\,=\\,+0.35\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,{\\rm for}\\,\\,\\ , \\feh\\le -1\\ ] ] @xmath24\\,=\\,-0.35\\times \\feh \\,\\,\\,\\,{\\rm for}\\,\\ , -1\\le\\feh\\le 0\\ ] ]    thus a cluster with an observed @xmath25 , for example , corresponds to a model with a metallicity @xmath26=\\log(z / z_\\odot)=\\mh\\sim -1.0 $ ] , certainly not @xmath27 .",
    "this latter choice does not take into account the enhancement of the @xmath28elements - elements include @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32,@xmath33,@xmath34,@xmath35,@xmath36,@xmath37,@xmath38,@xmath39 and @xmath40 and yields inconsistent comparisons , especially at the bottom of the ms where the stellar optical spectra and colors are shaped by h@xmath41 , mgh , cah and tio opacities .",
    "the ryan & norris correction is based on the spectroscopically - determined abundance of 370 kinematically selected halo stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "although this procedure is not as fully consistent as calculations conducted with the exact mixture , it certainly represents a fairly reasonable correction for the metal - poor star oxygen enrichment .",
    "the accuracy of this prescription will be demonstrated in  3.4 , where calculations with the appropriate @xmath1-enhanced mixture are presented .",
    "@xmath19 _ photometric conversion_. the afore mentioned clusters have been observed with the _ wide field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) _ of the hst , using either of the @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 filters , where @xmath45 refer to the standard ( johnson - cousins ) filters .",
    "thanks to the courtesy of a. cool , i. king , g. demarchi , f. paresce , g. gilmore and r. elson , we have been able to use the data in these filters , in the so - called wfpc2 _ flight _ system for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath16 . for these clusters ,",
    "comparison between theory and observations is made directly in the _ flight _ system , thus avoiding any possible uncertainties in the _ synthetic _ flight - to - ground photometric transformations of holtzman et al .",
    "the model magnitudes were calculated using the filter transmissions curves and the _ observed _ zero points prescribed by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the conversion of apparent @xmath46 ( observation ) to absolute @xmath47 ( theory ) magnitudes requires the knowledge of the distance modulus ( @xmath48 ) , corrected for the interstellar extinction in each filter . in order to minimize the bias in the comparison between theory and observation , we have used the analytical relationships of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) to calculate the extinctions from the m - dwarf synthetic spectra of allard & hauschildt ( 1997 ) over the whole frequency - range , from the reddening value @xmath49 quoted by the observers , and we have compared the observed data with the theoretical models _ corrected for reddening _ in the wfpc2 filters , when available .",
    "the extinction in each filter was found to depend very weakly on the spectral type ( @xmath50 mag ) , and thus to be fairly constant over the whole considered temperature range .",
    "we believe these determinations , based on accurate synthetic spectra , to yield the most accurate extinction and reddening corrections and the most consistent comparison between theory and observation .",
    "these values are given in table i , for each cluster , and compared to the values quoted by the observers .",
    "table i also summarizes the characteristics adopted for the three clusters of interest . note that some undetermination remains in the distance modulus of @xmath6 , yielding a difference in the magnitude of @xmath51 mag , as will be shown in  4 .",
    "this stresses the need for a more accurate determination of this parameter .",
    "we have derived recently evolutionary models aimed at describing the mechanical and thermal properties of lms .",
    "these models are based on the most recent physics characteristic of low - mass star interiors , equation of state ( saumon , chabrier & vanhorn 1995 ) , enhancement factors of the nuclear rates ( chabrier 1997 ) and updated opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ; opal ) , the last generation of non - grey atmophere models ( allard & hauschildt 1997 , ah97 ) and accurate boundary conditions between the interior and the atmosphere profiles .",
    "this latter condition is crucial for an accurate description of lms evolution , for which any diffusion approximation or grey treatment yield inaccurate results ( baraffe , chabrier , allard & hauschildt 1995 ; chabrier , baraffe and plez 1996 ; chabrier & baraffe , 1997 ) . a complete description of the physics involved in these stellar models is presented in chabrier and baraffe ( 1997 ) and we refer the reader to this paper for detailed information .    below @xmath52 , the stellar interior becomes fully convective : the evolution of lms below this limit is rather insensitive to the mixing length parameter @xmath53 , and thus the models are not subject to _ any _ adjustable parameter . from this point of view",
    ", vlms represent a formidable challenge for stellar evolution theory .",
    "comparison with the observations is straightforward and reflects directly the accuracy of the physics and the treatment of the ( self - consistent ) boundary conditions involved in the calculations . any vlms model including an adjustable parameter or a grey atmosphere approximation in order to match the observations",
    "would reflect shortcomings in the theory and thus would lead to unreliable results . from this point of view , it is important to stress that , although agreement with the observation is a _ necessary _ condition to assess the validity of a stellar model , it is not a _ sufficient _ condition .",
    "this latter requires the assessment of the accuracy of the input physics and requires _",
    "parameter - free , self - consistent _ calculations .",
    "the first generation of the present models ( baraffe et al .",
    "1995 ) were based on the `` base '' grid of model atmospheres of allard and hauschildt ( 1995 ; ah95 ) .",
    "these models improved significantly the comparison with the observed pop i and pop ii m - dwarfs sequences ( monet et al .",
    "1992 ) , down to the bottom of the main - sequence , w.r.t .",
    "previous models ( baraffe et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the ah95 models have been improved recently by including ( i ) a pressure broadening treatment of the lines , ( ii ) more complete molecular line lists , and ( iii ) by extending the _ opacity - sampling _ technique to the treatment of the molecular line absorption coefficients .",
    "this yields the so - called `` nextgen '' models ( allard and hauschildt 1997 ) .",
    "the `` nextgen '' synthetic spectra and colors have been compared with population - i m - dwarf observations by jones et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) , schweizer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , leggett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , viti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and have been used for the analysis of the brown dwarf gl229b by allard et al .",
    "the present work is the first application of the `` nextgen '' model atmospheres to observations and evolutionary calculations of metal - poor populations .",
    "a first ( preliminary ) set of the present improved stellar models has been shown to reproduce accurately the observed mass - magnitude ( henry & mc carthy 1993 ) and mass - spectral type ( kirkpatrick & mc carthy 1994 ) relationships for solar - metallicity lms down to the bottom of the main sequence ( chabrier , baraffe and plez 1996 ; baraffe & chabrier 1996 ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the comparison between theory and observation to metal - depleted abundances , characteristic of old disk and halo populations .    for this purpose",
    ", we have calculated evolutionary models for masses @xmath5 down to the hydrogen - burning limit , based on the `` nextgen '' model atmospheres , for different low metal abundances characteristic of old globular clusters , namely @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this low - metal grid represents a first step towards a complete generation of models covering solar metallicities .",
    "a major source of absorption in vlms arises from the presence of @xmath56 and @xmath57 molecular bands in the optical and the infrared , respectively .",
    "although tremendous progress has been accomplished over the past few years in this type of calculations , some uncertainty remains in the absorption coefficients of these molecules , which affect not only the spectrum , i.e. the colors , but also the profile of the atmosphere , and thus the evolution of late - type m dwarfs ( see allard et al .",
    "1997a for a review of vlm stellar atmospheres modeling ) .",
    "furthermore , the onset of grain formation , not included in the present models , may also affect the spectroscopic and structural properties of metal - rich vlms below @xmath58  k ( tsuji et al .",
    "1996a , b ; allard et al .",
    "we expect these shortcomings in the models to be of decreasing importance with decreasing metallicity .",
    "strong double - metal bands ( @xmath56 , @xmath59 ) , for example , are noticeably weaker in the spectra of metal - poor subdwarf ( see e.g. leggett 1992 ; dahn et al .",
    "1995 ) , whereas they would dominate the spectrum of a solar metallicity object at this temperature .",
    "for this reason it is important to first examine the accuracy of the models for low - metal abundances and its evolution with increasing metallicity .",
    "the observed ms of the three afore - mentioned hst gcs represent a unique possibility to conduct such a project .    in some cases",
    ", comparison is made with the first generation of models ( baraffe et al .",
    "1995 ) , based on the `` base '' model atmospheres .",
    "this will illustrate the effect of the most recent progress accomplished in the treatment of lms atmospheres .",
    "all the basic models assume a mixing length parameter , both in the interior and in the atmosphere , @xmath60 .",
    "since the value of the mixing length parameter is likely to depend to some extent on the metallicity , there is no reason for the value of @xmath1 in globular clusters to be the same as for the sun .",
    "although the choice of @xmath1 is inconsequential for fully convective stars , it will start bearing consequences on the models as soon as a radiative core starts to develop in the interior . for metallicities",
    "@xmath61 , this occurs for masses @xmath62 @xmath0 ( see chabrier & baraffe 1997 for details ) . in order to examine the effect of the mixing length parameter for masses above this limit , we have carried out some calculations with @xmath63 , both in the interior and in the atmosphere ( see  3.2 below ) .",
    "all the models assume a solar - mix abundance ( grevesse & noels 1993 ) . as discussed in the previous section , oxygen - enhancement in metal - poor stars",
    "is taken into account by using the eqn.(1 ) as the correspondence law between solar - mix and @xmath1-enhanced abundances . in order to test the accuracy of this procedure , a limited set of calculations with the exact @xmath1-enriched mixture",
    "have also been performed (  3.4 ) .",
    "the adopted helium fraction is @xmath64 for all metallicities .",
    "the effect of helium abundance will also be examined below .",
    "all models have been followed from the initial deuterium burning phase to a maximum age of 15 10@xmath65 yr .    before comparing the results with observations ,",
    "we first examine some intrinsic properties of the models .",
    "comparison is also made with other recent lms models for metal - poor stars , namely dantona & mazzitelli ( 1996 ; dm96 ) and the teramo group of dr .",
    "castellani ( alexander et al . 1997 ) .",
    "although the eos used by the teramo group is the same as in the present calculations ( scvh ) , both groups use grey model atmospheres based on a @xmath66 relationship , and match the interior and the atmosphere structures either at an optical depth @xmath67 ( dm96 ) or at the onset of convection ( teramo group ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the mass - effective temperature relationship for two metallicities , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) ( solid line ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath71)(dash - dot line ) .",
    "we note the two well established changes in the slope at @xmath72 4500 k and 3800 k , respectively , for these metallicities .",
    "the first one corresponds to the onset of molecular formation in the atmosphere , and the related changes in the opacity ( see e.g. copeland , jensen & jorgensen 1970 ; kroupa , tout & gilmore 1990 ) .",
    "the second reflects the overwhelming importance of electron degeneracy in the stellar interior near the hydrogen burning limit ( dm96 ; chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) .",
    "as expected , the enhanced pressures of lower metallicity mixtures yield larger effective temperatures for a given mass ( see chabrier & baraffe , 1997 ) .",
    "also shown on the figure are comparisons with dm96 and the teramo group , for comparable metallicities .",
    "the dm96 models ( dotted line ) overestimate substantially the effective temperature , by up to @xmath73 k below 0.5 @xmath0 .",
    "this will yield substantially blue - shifted sequences in the cmds .",
    "this is a direct consequence of using a @xmath66 prescription ( and a different eos , and adiabatic gradient ) , which implies a grey atmosphere and radiative equilibrium , two conditions which become invalid under low - mass star characteristic conditions , as demonstrated in previous work ( chabrier , baraffe & plez 1996 ; chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) .",
    "the krishna - swamy ( 1966,ks ) formula used by the teramo group is known to slightly improve this shortcoming . as shown in the figure",
    ", we reproduce the teramo results ( dashed line ) when using the ks @xmath66 relationship ( filled circles ) .",
    "though smaller , the departure of the mass-@xmath74 relationship in that case is still significant , in particular near the brown dwarf domain , where it becomes too steep and predicts too large hydrogen burning minimum masses ( see chabrier & baraffe , 1997 ) .",
    "a detailed examination of these different prescriptions is given in chabrier & baraffe ( 1997 ) .",
    "these comparisons show that , even though some improvement can be reached w.r.t .",
    "the basic eddington approximation , _ any _ atmosphere - interior boundary treatment based on a prescribed @xmath66 relation yields incorrect , substantially overestimated , effective temperatures for @xmath75 k , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "conversely , they underestimate the mass for a given temperature ( luminosity ) below this limit , i.e. at the bottom of the ms .",
    "this illustrates the unreliability of any grey - like treatment to describe accurately the non - grey effects and the presence of convection in optically thin layers of vlm stars .",
    "this bears important consequences for the cooling history and thus the evolution in general , and for the mass - luminosity relationship and thus the mass calibration in particular .      in this section",
    ", we examine the effect of the mixing length parameter @xmath77 on the stellar models , for a given metallicity .",
    "we must distinguish the effect of this parameter in the stellar _ interior _ and in the _",
    "atmosphere_. both effects reflect the importance of convective transport in two completely different regions of the star , namely the envelope and the photosphere , and thus do not necessarily bear the same consequences on the models .",
    "we first examine the effect of the mixing length parameter in the _ atmosphere _ , by conducting evolutionary calculations with non - grey model atmospheres for [ m / h]=-1.5 , calculated with @xmath78 and 2 , while the value is kept unchanged in the interior .",
    "we have selected a range of effective temperatures and gravities ( @xmath79 = 4000 - 5800 k , log g = 4.5 - 5 ) corresponding to masses @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "the atmosphere profiles corresponding to both situations are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the onset of convection and the location of the optical depth @xmath82 = 1 are indicated .",
    "as seen on the figure , the atmosphere profile is rather insensitive to a variation of @xmath1 in the _ optically - thin _",
    "region , as expected from the rather shallow convection zone in the atmosphere at this metallicity and effective temperature .",
    "the main consequence is that the spectrum , and thus the colors and magnitudes at a given @xmath79 , remain almost unaffected ( less than 0.04 mag in the afore - mentioned range ) .",
    "below @xmath83 k , the effect of the mixing length in the atmosphere is inconsequential ( see also brett 1995 ) .",
    "the evolutionary models calculated with both sets of model atmospheres in the selected range of effective temperatures differ by less than 50 k in @xmath74 .",
    "the effect of the mixing length in the atmosphere thus bears no consequence on the evolution .",
    "we now examine the effect of convection in the stellar _ interior _ , by conducting calculations with @xmath78 and 2 in the interior , keeping the fiducial value @xmath78 in the atmosphere .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3a by comparing the solid line ( and empty circles ) , which corresponds to @xmath78 in the interior , with the dashed line ( triangles ) , which corresponds to @xmath84 , for @xmath85 gyr . as expected",
    "the effect is null or negligible for convection - dominated interiors , i.e. @xmath86 . above this limit , a larger mixing parameter , i.e. a more efficient convection , yields slightly hotter ( bluer ) models ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ; chabrier & baraffe , 1997 ) , about 200 - 300 k for @xmath87 k , i.e. @xmath88 , for the metallicity of interest , @xmath68 .    in summary ,",
    "the effect of the variation of the mixing length parameter on the stellar models remains weak for the lower ms and is essentially affected by the value in the stellar interior .",
    "a variation of @xmath78 to 2 yields variations @xmath89 on the effective temperature in the upper ms , for masses above @xmath90 , while the luminosity remains essentially unaffected .",
    "we will examine in section 4.1 whether comparison with the observed ms of gcs can help calibrating this value .",
    "the effect of the age in a color - magnitude diagram is shown on figure 3a , for @xmath68 for ages @xmath85 and 15 gyr .",
    "the time required to reach the zero - age main sequence is much smaller than the age of gcs over the entire stellar mass range so that _ all",
    "_ hydrogen burning objects do lie on the ms and the bottom of the gc ms is unaffected by age variation . on the other hand ,",
    "metal - poor stars are significantly hotter and more luminous than their more metal - rich counterparts . therefore , for a given mass , they burn more rapidly hydrogen in their core , and thus evolve more quickly off the ms .",
    "the more massive ( i.e. hotter ) the star , the larger the effect .",
    "this defines the turn - off point , i.e. the top of the ms . for fixed metallicity , the turn - off point",
    "will thus be reached for lower masses , i.e. fainter absolute magnitudes , as the age increases .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3a where we compare the 10 gyr and 15 gyr isochrones calculated for different mixing length parameters , for the same metallicity .",
    "while the position in the hr diagram of masses below @xmath91 remains unchanged , larger masses become substantially bluer and more luminous with age as they transform more central hydrogen into helium . the resulting increase of molecular weight",
    "yields further contraction and heating of the central layers , and thus an increase of the radiative flux ( @xmath92 ) and the luminosity .",
    "eventually they evolve off the ms for a ( turn - off)-mass @xmath93 for @xmath68 and @xmath94 at t=10 gyr and @xmath95 at 15 gyr .",
    "as shown on the figure , the upper ms is sensitive to age and mixing length variations .",
    "the calibration of the mixing length parameter on the turn - off point is then altered by age uncertainties .",
    "the _ precise _ determination of the turn - off point thus requires more detailed calculations , which are out the scope of the present study .",
    "as mentioned above , the fiducial calculations have been conducted with a helium abundance @xmath64 .",
    "figure 3b compares these results ( solid line ; circles ) , for @xmath68 , with calculations done with @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the corresponding variations of the temperature ( color ) and the luminosity ( magnitude ) are negligible over the entire mass range , except near the turn - off point .    in order to examine the accuracy of the ryan & norris prescription ( eqn.(1 ) ) , we have conducted calculations using model atmospheres computed with an @xmath1-element abundance enrichment of @xmath98=0.3 $ ] for a @xmath25 ( @xmath99=-1.0 $ ] ) mixture . since the spectra of vlms near the bottom of the ms",
    "are governed by @xmath1-elements , we expect this mixture to yield equivalent results to those obtained with the scaled - solar abundance mixture of [ m / h]= -1.0",
    ". this test will also determine whether neglecting a relative under - abundance of @xmath100 and other non-@xmath1 elements in the scaled - solar abundances does affect or not the shape of the ms .",
    "we have computed model atmospheres with the afore - mentioned modified abundances for several temperatures and gravities in the range @xmath101 k and @xmath102 .",
    "we find that the atmosphere density and temperature profiles and the colors are essentially undistinguishable from the ones calculated with @xmath103=0.0 $ ] , @xmath104 , i.e. a scaled solar - mix , throughout the entire atmosphere .",
    "we have also examined the effect of @xmath1-enriched abundances in the _ interior _ opacities ( opal ) , thanks to appropriate opacities kindly provided by f. rogers for @xmath105=-1.0 and @xmath98=0.3 $ ] . here",
    "too we find that the effect is negligible and does not modify noticeably the isochrones .",
    "this assesses the validity of the ryan & norris procedure to take into account the @xmath1-element enrichment for metal - poor stars , and demonstrates the consistency of our prescription , i.e. comparing solar - mix models with @xmath99=\\mh=-1.0 $ ] to observations with @xmath25 .",

    "<S> we show that the expected signature of the stellar to substellar transition in color - magnitude diagrams is a severe blueshift in the infrared colors , due to the increasing collision - induced absorption of molecular hydrogen with increasing density and decreasing temperature .    at last , we apply these calculations to the observed halo field stars , which yields a precise determination of their metallicity , and thus of their galactic origin . </S>",
