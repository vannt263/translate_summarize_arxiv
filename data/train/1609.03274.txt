    "evidence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) have essentially come from two discoveries : the existence of non - zero neutrino masses and cosmological evidence for the existence of the dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "although it is not established whether the dm is of astrophysical origin , or of particle physics , many models have been proposed as an extension of sm to accommodate a stable weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) which can satisfy dm constraints .",
    "similarly , several models of neutrino mass generation have been proposed to satisfy the observed neutrino masses and mixing",
    ". however , to bring them under one umbrella seems harder if not impossible @xcite . the main incentive for addressing such",
    "a cause is that both neutrinos and dms necessarily have to be coupled weakly to the sm .    in this note",
    "we try to address both the issues of neutrino masses and dm together with a minimal possible extension of the sm .",
    "the simplest way of accommodating dm is to assume the existence of a singlet scalar ( @xmath0 ) which is coupled to the sm through higgs portal coupling .",
    "the stability of such a dm is ensured with imposing a @xmath1 symmetry under which the dm is odd , while the sm is even .",
    "the phenomenology of such a case have been discussed in different contexts for the simplicity and predictability @xcite .",
    "however , non - observation of dm in direct search experiments is pushing this model under tight constraints . excepting for higgs resonance ( @xmath6 ) region , the singlet scalar dm",
    "is essentially ruled out from the direct detection constraints @xcite .",
    "however , we demonstrate here that scalar singlet dm with higgs - portal interaction can still survive without incorporating semi - annihilation @xcite , or multi - component feature @xcite if we can think of additional interactions of such dm to produce right amount of relic density as observed by wmap @xcite or planck @xcite .",
    "in such a situation the effective dm - sm portal coupling required to generate correct density is _ reduced _ and so is the direct search cross - section ; keeping the dm alive after strong bounds of lux @xcite , xenon100 @xcite .",
    "while we know that neutrino masses can effectively be generated though the existence of additional ew quadruplet scalar ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , the singlet scalar @xmath0 can couple to it and can annihilate to them whenever the mass of the dm is larger than @xmath3 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this effectively then reduces annihilation cross - sections for @xmath8 and keeps the model alive in a much larger region of parameter space from direct search experiment .",
    "we also point out that constraints coming from neutrino masses do not affect too much to the dark sector .    after the sad demise of the 750 gev diphoton excess at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , we point out the modified bound on the ew quadruplet and the dm in absence of any signal beyond sm coming from the lhc experiments",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we discuss the extensions beyond sm to accommodate dm and neutrino masses . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] , we analyze the constraints on the model from relic density and direct detection searches of the dark matter .",

    "our model is based on the sm symmetry group @xmath9 supplemented by an unbroken discrete @xmath1 symmetry . in the fermion sector ,",
    "in addition to the sm fermions , we add two vector - like @xmath10 triplet leptons , @xmath11 and @xmath5 . in the scalar sector , in addition to the usual sm higgs doublet , @xmath12 , we introduce an isospin @xmath2 scalar , @xmath3 , and an ew singlet , @xmath0 .",
    "the singlet scalar , @xmath0 is odd under @xmath1 , while all other particles in the model are even under @xmath1 .",
    "let us mention that the extra particles @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are introduced to generate tiny neutrino masses via the dimension seven operators @xcite .",
    "we will discuss more on this after we introduce the scalar potential .",
    "this model can explain neutrino masses for reasonable choice of parameters , and can accommodate both normal and inverted hierarchy for the neutrino masses .",
    "the singlet scalar , @xmath0 along with the @xmath1 symmetry introduced in this framework , provides with a viable candidate for dm , and is one of the major motivations of this work .",

    "the additional singlet s that we have introduced gets no vev ( @xmath23 ) to keep the @xmath1 symmetry intact .",

    "as can be seen from the above equation , this mass splitting is arbitrary depending on the value of @xmath33 .",

    "the yukawa interactions involving @xmath0 and the sm fermions are also forbidden by the ew as well as @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "scalar singlet extension of sm to accommodate dm through higgs portal interaction is under tension as the allowed region of relic density space has mostly been ruled out excepting for the higgs resonance by direct search experiment , especially the lux data @xcite .",

    "<S> we propose a simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) which has a viable dark matter ( dm ) candidate , as well as can explain the generation of tiny neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> the dm is an electroweak ( ew ) singlet scalar @xmath0 , odd under an imposed exact @xmath1 symmetry , interacting to sm through ` higgs - portal ' coupling , while all other particles are even under @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model also has an ew isospin @xmath2 scalar , @xmath3 and a pair of ew isospin vector , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , responsible for generating tiny neutrino mass via the effective dimension seven operator . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the additional interactions with @xmath3 , the scalar singlet dm @xmath0 survives a large region of parameter space by relic density constraints from wmap / planck and direct search bounds from updated lux data . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the model from large hadron collider ( lhc ) has also been discussed . </S>"
