    "this poses the question of how ballistic _ transport effects _ observed in many supposedly ballistic experiments actually are . to illustrate this",
    "let us examine the two sections of magnetoresistance curves from two different samples fabricated to the exact same specifications shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ( details will be given below ) . in an ideal ( i.e. ballistic ) sample patterned in this specific layout ( depicted in the inset ) electrons emitted from point contact c@xmath17 are deflected by a magnetic field and for a certain value @xmath13 will be directed towards the second point contact c@xmath18 .",

    ", our new magnetic focusing device allows us to explain why these consequences of branching have not been seen in previous magnetic focusing geometries .",
    "we prelude the detailed presentation of our results by an illustrative explanation of the mechanism of branch formation , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a and b. an initially homogeneous particle flow or plane wave front ( restricted source in momentum space ) is propagated along the @xmath2-direction through a two - dimensional disorder potential . a color rendition ( from green to white ) of the disorder potential",
    "is plotted in the background of panel a. for the sake of simplicity , only the electrostatic force exerted by the disorder potential in the @xmath7-direction is considered . the force in @xmath2-direction",
    "is ignored , so that the longitudinal velocity @xmath20 stays constant and the wave front remains a vertical line in coordinate space .",
    "this model makes the principles of branching particularly easy to understand and yet captures all of its important features @xcite .",
    "later on , an extension of the model will also allow us to study the statistics of the formation of branches in a magnetic field analytically .",
    "the particle or flow density @xmath9 is shown in panel [ fig:1]a using a gray scale .",
    "while @xmath9 is initially homogeneous or independent of @xmath7 , it develops features at later times as illustrated in panel b where @xmath21 is plotted at selected times . at a time between @xmath10 and @xmath22",
    ", a strong peak develops in @xmath9 .",
    "this heralds the first branch . in the phase space ( @xmath7,@xmath8 )",
    ", the wave front develops a pair of initially coalescing turning points , which subsequently separate ( panel a bottom ) . here",
    ", the classical ray density in coordinate space diverges and also the quantum mechanical wave intensity would peak nearby . in between the turning points , the wave front folds in phase space and covers the same spatial coordinate three times . as a result",
    ", the local density is enhanced .",
    "the path traced by a turning point constitutes a fold line or caustic .",
    "a branch is referred to as the spatial region in between two such random caustics .",
    "figure  [ fig:2]a illustrates another instance of caustic formation and branching when particles are emitted from a point source ( restricted source in coordinate space ) . in this example , no approximation concerning the electrostatic force associated with the disorder potential is made and the full two - dimensional particle dynamics is considered .",
    "branches appear on similar length scales as for the simplified plane wave case due to the same basic mechanism .",
    "this setup can be implemented straightforwardly in a gaas based 2deg on which a quantum point contact ( qpc ) is patterned either by etching or the split gate technique @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to oppose the appearance of branches due to the disorder induced formation of random caustics to the focusing of two - dimensional electrons emitted from a point source in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath23 in the absence of disorder .",
    "we do this , because also in the magnetic focusing problem caustics play an important role @xcite . in a magnetic field ,",
    "the electrons execute circular cyclotron orbits with a radius @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron density .",
    "when emitted from a point source , the electron trajectories converge at a distance of one cyclotron diameter away from the point source and a caustic forms .",

    "when enforcing zero net current flow through this qpc and measuring the voltage drop across , the enhanced local density can be detected as a voltage or resistance peak @xcite .",
    "one may anticipate that disorder induced branching also produces resistance peaks when sweeping the magnetic field .      in order to search for evidence of branching in dc ballistic transport we have chosen the corner shaped device depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c , which , as we will show , can distinguish between deterministic magnetic focusing at the collecting qpc and random focusing caused by branching .",
    "the left panel shows trajectories in the absence of disorder at the field @xmath1 for which @xmath28 .",
    "the flow density along the bottom boundary is plotted and forms a broad peak centered around the collecting point contact opening for this magnetic field .",
    "it is not caused by magnetic focusing since a caustic has not yet developed .",
    "rather it results from the collimating properties of the emitting point contact from which electron trajectories leave with a cosinusoidal angular distribution .",
    "one may anticipate that it produces a first resistance peak @xcite . at the field @xmath29 ( right panel of figure  [ fig:2]c ) , the particle flow converges first into the device corner where",
    "a caustic has formed due to magnetic focusing .",
    "the corner was chamfered to have well defined reflection .",
    "after specular reflection the electron trajectories refocus at the collecting qpc giving rise to another resistance maximum .",
    "figures  [ fig:2]c and d illustrate how the disorder potential affects the particle flow for both values of the magnetic field . while at @xmath29 the influence of disorder is weak , the flow density has been drastically altered for @xmath13 and now exhibits multiple maxima of comparable size .",
    "the magnetic focusing feature at @xmath29 remains largely unaltered and is more robust against disorder induced branching .",
    "these conclusions can be generalized and also hold at higher magnetic fields . in the absence of disorder , the flow density reaches a maximum at the collecting qpc for @xmath30 , where @xmath31=1,2,@xmath5 .",
    "collimation and focusing are responsible for these maxima at odd and even values of @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the collimation features are prone to disorder induced splitting , while the focusing features are generally more resilient . as opposed to the conventional transverse magnetic focusing geometry @xcite , in this corner device deterministic focusing and collimation",
    "are separated on the magnetic field axis and hence this geometry lends itself particularly well to confirm the theoretical predictions .",

    "to corroborate our assertion that the splitting of the collimation features comes from disorder induced branching , we have numerically calculated resistances for different disorder potential realizations . we simulate transport in the corner device by following classical trajectories from the emitting qpc until they either reach the collecting qpc and contribute to the transmission , or until they leave the system to the right of the collector . within the landauer - bttiker - formalism , we approximate the resistance @xmath43 measured in a four - terminal setup to be proportional to the transmission probability from emitter to collector .",
    "the qpc is tailored as a sum of variable - depth hyperbolic tangents , and we assume the presence of a saddle potential inside the qpc .",
    "soft wall effects due to depletion are modeled by using a quadratic potential @xcite . in the simulations , it is assumed that the particles enter the qpc from a lead with a cosinusoidal angular distribution .",
    "the saddle potential then has the effect of collimating the flow .",
    "we find that to obtain a collimation peak which is consistent with the experimental results , a saddle potential of approximately 80@xmath44@xmath45 is needed .",
    "the precise functional form of the saddle potential is given in [ ] , and is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "we note that the results presented here do not depend significantly on the parameters which describe the electrostatic walls .",
    "the weak disorder potential used in the simulations is modeled as a gaussian random field with zero mean and standard deviation of the amplitude of the disorder potential v@xmath38 = 2@xmath44e@xmath46 , and a gaussian correlation function @xmath47  =  @xmath48 , with correlation length @xmath49 = 180  nm .",
