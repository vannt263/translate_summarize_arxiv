    "normal state transport in high-@xmath0 superconductors remains a controversial subject .",
    "there are two broad classes of theoretical approaches : the ( generalized ) fermi liquid , in which the basic current carrying entities are electrons , and the non fermi liquid in which the basic entities are more exotic objects , e.g. spinons and holons @xcite , phase fluctuations of a superconducting order parameter @xcite or fermions with definite charge conjugation symmetry @xcite . in fermi - liquid based approaches one must invoke an anomalous scattering mechanism .",
    "various models have been proposed @xcite ; a central concept is the `` hot spot '' , a small region on the fermi surface ( typically taken to be near the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points ) where the electron lifetime is unusually short and has an anomalous temperature dependence .",
    "hot spots arise e.g. in models involving antiferromagnetic fluctuations strongly peaked at a particular momentum transfer .",
    "models involving hot spots have had some successes , but have not led to complete and generally accepted descriptions of cuprate physics @xcite .",
    "in this paper we argue that the data are better described in terms of _ cold spots _ : small regions which we take to be near the zone diagonal and in which we assume the lifetime is much _ longer _ than elsewhere on the fermi surface a somewhat similar model was recently put forward by zheleznyak et . al.@xcite and the idea bears an intriguing resemblance to the fermi segments appearing in a phenomenological model of preformed pairs @xcite and found in recent @xmath3 gauge theory calculations @xcite    we do not at present have a controlled calculation from a microscopic model which produces cold spots ; we suggest however that they might arise from strong @xmath4 pairing fluctuations of the type proposed in @xcite , and we present a leading order estimate along these lines in section iv below .",
    "there are four phenomenological justifications .",
    "one is the apparently successful description of transport and most aspects of magnetotransport to be discussed at length below .",
    "a second justification comes from photoemission .",
    "experiments @xcite on optimally doped curprates show that for momenta parallel to @xmath5 the electron spectral function exhibits a reasonably well - defined quasiparticle peak , suggesting relatively weak scattering .",
    "however , for momenta near @xmath6 or @xmath2 , there is no discernible peak ( at @xmath7 ) : the spectral function is very broad , suggesting relatively strong scattering .",
    "thus photoemission implies a lifetime which is generically short but has a pronounced angular dependence .",
    "a third justification comes from c - axis transport . in",
    "optimally doped materials the observed @xmath8 is large , and only weakly temperature dependent , while @xmath9 is small , and strongly temperature dependent .",
    "the anisotropy @xmath10 increases strongly as t is decreased . within a fermi liquid picture",
    "this is explicable only if the two quantities are controlled by different parts of the fermi surface .",
    "band theory calculations have shown that this may occur in high @xmath0 materials : the calculated between - planes hopping @xmath11 is strongly momentum dependent , vanishing for momenta parallel to @xmath12 and being maximal for momenta parallel to @xmath6@xcite .",
    "therefore the observation of very different temperature dependences of @xmath9 and @xmath8 implies that @xmath13 must be controlled by carriers with momentum nearly parallel to @xmath14 and that these carriers must have a much longer lifetime than do carriers on other parts of the fermi surface .",
    "a fourth argument concerns the anomalously small vortex viscosity measured by parks _",
    "et al _ @xcite or inferred from resistivity data @xcite .",
    "this , it has been argued , can only be explained by a strongly anisotropic scattering rate .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model and derive an approximate solution . in section iii",
    "we compare the solution to data and present new experimental tests . in section",
    "iv we discuss a possible microscopic origin .",
    "section v is a conclusion .",
    "to motivate the model , we consider the c - axis conductivity @xmath15 . in very anisotropic systems such as high - tc superconductors",
    "an adequate theoretical expression is    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the interplane hopping , @xmath18 is the fermi function and @xmath19 are the retarded and advanced in - plane green functions evaluated at the chemical potential , which in our conventions is @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath25 is the quasiparticle renormalization factor , @xmath26 is the ( renormalized ) fermi velocity and @xmath27 is a scattering rate . in a conventional fermi liquid at low t , @xmath28 with @xmath29 an impurity scattering time . evaluating eq .",
    "[ sigma_c ] using eq .",
    "[ gfl ] and neglecting the incoherent part yields    @xmath30    here @xmath31 denotes an integral along the fermi line .",
    "the main temperature dependence in this formula comes from @xmath32 , so in a conventional fermi liquid in which quantities depend only weakly on position on the fermi surface , @xmath33 would have the same temperature dependence as @xmath34 .",
    "to explain the observed t - dependence of @xmath10 one must either assume @xmath35 ( i.e. non fermi liquid behavior ) or invoke a strong angular dependence in @xmath36 . in this paper we study the consequences of the latter assumption . because @xmath8 is large and has only a weak t - dependence in optimally doped materials , over most of the fermi surface @xmath32",
    "must be large and have only a weak temperature dependence .",
    "because @xmath9 is small and temperature dependent @xmath32 must be small and temperature dependent in the parts of the fermi surface where @xmath17 vanishes .",
    "therefore we assume that @xmath32 has a large , angular dependent part which vanishes quadratically for momenta parallel to @xmath5 and has negligible frequency and temperature dependence .",
    "we parametrize the fermi surface by a magnitude @xmath37 and angle @xmath38 , with @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath40 along the zone diagonal and write @xmath41 near the diagonals we approximate @xmath42 the fermi - liquid scattering rate , @xmath43 , is taken to be the sum of an impurity part and a @xmath44 part ; explicitly @xmath45 here @xmath46 is an energy scale which in conventional fermi liquid is of the order of the fermi temperature but which we take as an adjustable parameter ; we will find that it is small of the order of @xmath47 for optimally doped @xmath48 , suggesting that even the diagonal scattering is stronger than in a usual fermi liquid .",
    "note that @xmath49 may in pronciple have @xmath50 dependence as well but we assume that it is weak because fluctuations causing the scattering are slow",
    ".    the parameter @xmath51 may be estimated from photoemission experiments .",
    "in optimally doped cuprates in the normal state one observes near the @xmath52 point a very broad weakly dispersing feature with an energy half - width @xmath53 ( see e.g. fig 6 of ref @xcite ) , suggesting @xmath54 . for our numerical estimates",
    "we take @xmath55 because it fits the optical data well .    to study the effects of this unusual scattering on the electrons we write a relaxation - time boltzmann equation for the quasiparticle distribution function @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57f_p = -\\gamma ( f_p - f^0 )   \\label{boltzmann}\\ ] ]    because of the strong variation of @xmath58 we shall be mainly interested in states near the zone diagonal .",
    "we therefore introduce coordinates along and perpendicular to the diagonal ; only the dependence perpendicular is non - trivial .",
    "the boltzmann equation becomes    @xmath59\\delta f(\\theta,\\omega)=-e\\vec{e}\\cdot\\vec{v}(\\theta)\\frac{\\partial f } { \\partial \\epsilon_p }   \\label{boltztheta}\\ ] ]    this equation may be solved . because it turns out that the physics is dominated by @xmath60 near the zone diagonals we may approximate @xmath61 and @xmath62 by their values @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath65 . then in the first quadrant and for @xmath66 parallel to the zone diagonal",

    "we have chosen the electric field to be parallel to the zone diagonal so we have    @xmath69    @xmath70    at @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74    eq .",
    "( [ sigma_xx ] ) predicts that if @xmath75 then @xmath76 , as observed in optimally doped cuprates .",
    "qualitatively this behavior occurs because the conductivity is dominated by a small patch ( width @xmath77 ) of weakly scattered ( lifetime @xmath78 ) electrons .",
    "similarly , the weak field hall conductivity is @xmath79    and , expanding to @xmath80 , @xmath81    as we shall see in the next section , all of these formulas agree quantitatively with experiment except for the magnetoresistance .",
    "if the leading term in eq ( [ delta_rho_xx ] ) were absent , it would agree also .",
    "these expressions apply in the weak field limit , in which an electron is scattered many times before the magnetic field bends its orbit appreciably . in the present context ",
    "appreciably  means that the electron leaves the small patch of size p near the diagonal which dominates conduction , in contrast to the usual case in which  appreciably  means  completes of order one cyclotron orbit .",
    " the criterion for the weak field limit @xmath82 is    @xmath83    in the high field , @xmath84 limit one may calculate by dropping the linear terms in the argument of the exponential . then calculations give @xmath85 and @xmath86    so @xmath87 .",
    "this result may be understood as follows : one expects @xmath88 ; here the effective number of carriers is the size of the conducting patch which in the high field limit is of order @xmath89 .",
    "we now discuss the applicability of our results to data . we begin with clean , optimally doped @xmath90 . in one sample of this material",
    "the resistivity at @xmath0 was about @xmath91@xcite ; the mean interplane spacing of @xmath92 implies @xmath93 per plane .",
    "photoemission measurements @xcite yield a zone - diagonal velocity @xmath94 and @xmath95 ; use of these values and the observed @xmath96 per plane implies @xmath97 .",
    "our rough estimate @xmath98 then implies @xmath99 at @xmath100 and therefore @xmath101 , although the uncertainties are substantial .",
    "the observed linearity of the resistivity then implies @xmath102 at @xmath103 .",
    "we next use eq ( [ sigma_xx ] ) to fit the observed frequency dependent conductivity .",
    "calculation and data @xcite are shown in fig 1 for @xmath104 .",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath105 , very close to the @xmath106 estimated from dc transport .",
    "we have also fit @xmath107 and @xmath108 data ; agreement is comparatively good and leads to a @xmath109 dependence of @xmath110 .",
    "optical conductivity , @xmath111 , at @xmath103 in the units of @xmath112 plotted versus frequency ( @xmath113 ) : data from ref @xcite ( shown as dots ) and fit to eq .",
    "( [ sigma_xx ] ) with @xmath114 shown as solid line .",
    "drude fit with @xmath115 shown as dashed line .",
    "the agreement between model and data is very reasonable ; we note especially the narrowness of the drude peak and the fact that upward concavity persists down to a very low frequency .",
    "many authors have argued that the observed @xmath116 should be interpreted in terms of a frequency dependent scattering rate @xmath117 defined as @xmath118 in the dc limit @xmath119 is supposed to be proportional to @xmath77 , with constant of proportionality determined from the requirement that @xmath120 reproduce the london penetration depth . in the @xmath121 samples of @xcite this implies @xmath122 . in the inset to fig .",
    "1 we compare the data to the naive ansatz a frequency independent scattering rate @xmath123 . as can be this leads to seen in the inset , this leads to a conductivity which has too little upward concavity at low frequencies , in contrast to eq ( [ sigma_xx ] ) which fits well over the entire frequency range .",
    "the observed upward concavity implies that the intrinsic low - frequency scattering rate is much smaller at @xmath103 than @xmath124 obtained from the naive analysis .",
    "the discussion of @xmath125 to be presented below will show that the intrinsic rate varies as @xmath109 , not as @xmath77 .",
    "both of these facts follow directly from our model but seem otherwise difficult to understand .",
    "we now turn to the high frequency behavior .",
    "the deviation between data and naive drude model visible in fig .",
    "1 has been previously been attributed to an anomalous frequency dependent scattering although a generally accepted microscopic derivation has not been found .",
    "one difficulty is that many mechanisms for producing a @xmath77-linear resistivity involve scattering off quasistatic fluctuations ; such scattering leads to a too weak frequency dependence of the scattering rate and therefore to a too rapid decrease of @xmath126 .",
    "for example , in the gauge theory approach one finds @xmath127 with @xmath128 or @xmath129 depending on whether spinons or holons dominate the transport @xcite .",
    "another difficulty is that in most models the @xmath130 and @xmath77 dependences add , leading to a @xmath77 dependence of the high frequency @xmath131 which is inconsistent with the data .",
    "by contrast , in the present approach the frequency dependence is essentially a phase space effect and there is therefore only little @xmath77 dependence at large @xmath130 . an alternative model which gives the correct high @xmath130 behavior is the luttinger model of anderson @xcite .    to further characterize the conductivity we consider the conductivity phase angle , @xmath132 . in fig .",
    "2 we show data for this quantity for @xmath90 at @xmath133 that have been provided to us by basov _ et al _ and data at @xmath134 that we extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite .    before proceeding with a more detailed analysis",
    "it should be noted that basov _ at al _ conductivity data were obtained on untwinned crystals with the light polarized in the direction perpendicular to the chains and so this conductivity does not include contributions from the chains in contrast to the data of ref @xcite obtained on twinned samples .",
    "this is why the absolute magnitude of @xmath135 at @xmath136 obtained by basov _",
    "et al _ are smaller in magnitude than those reported by orenstein _",
    "et al _ by a factor of 2 at @xmath137 .",
    "this makes a detailed comparison difficult .",
    "qualitatively , however , we see that the phase angle tends to a value of the order of unity at high frequencies , and that the crossover from the high frequency limit occurs at a relatively low frequency .",
    "the fact that phase angle tends to a constant implies that the real and imaginary parts of the conductivity vary as @xmath138 ; that the constant is near unity imples that @xmath139 ( in general if @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) consistent with our form eq  ( [ sigma_xx ] ) .",
    "we also note that high frequency limit @xmath142 is in a reasonable agreement with the empirical observation @xcite that for many high-@xmath0 materials the high frequency conductivity obeys a scaling @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "we further note that the widespread practice @xcite of plotting @xmath145 is not very informative in such cases , the constant high frequency limit of the ratio guarantees an apparently linear  scattering rate  . despite the uncertainties we have fit the observed frequency dependence of the phase angle to our theoretically expected form @xmath146 $ ] ; the results are shown in fig . 2 along with the data .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath110 used in these fits agrees well in magnitude with that determined from the dc conductivity or the data of @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that one sees directly from the data in fig .",
    "2 that there is an intrinsic frequency scale in the problem which varies more nearly as @xmath109 than as @xmath77 at low temperatures .",
    "this frequency scale occurs naturally in our model .",
    "optical conductivity phase angle @xmath147 plotted versus frequency ( @xmath148 ) : data at @xmath149 from @xcite and at @xmath150 from @xcite ( thick dashed curve ) and fit to eq ( [ sigma_xx ] ) with @xmath151 , ( thin curve ) and @xmath152 ( thin dashed curve ) .",
    "we now turn to the weak - field hall conductance .",
    "we have @xmath153    \\label{cot_h}\\ ] ] thus the model yields the @xmath154 law found experimentally .",
    "more interestingly , it implies that over a wide frequency range @xmath155 and @xmath156 . precisely this behavior has been observed experimentally ( see fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from these data",
    "we may infer that at @xmath100 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , consistent with @xmath160 inferred from the @xmath96 conductivity .",
    "thus at @xmath161 the scattering rate determined from the ac hall effect is numerically the same as that determined from the zero field ac conductivity .",
    "ac hall data at other temperatures are not available but the observed @xmath109 dependence of the dc hall angle suggests to us that all temperatures the `` hall scattering rate '' is identical to our @xmath162 , and is not an independent quantity .",
    "extension of the optical hall angle data to higher temperature and frequencies would be of great interest : the present model predicts the frequency dependence should persist to high frequencies until the @xmath163 term in @xmath164 becomes important ; a hint of this behavior may be discerned in the data of ref .",
    "@xcite although the measured @xmath165 is constant within error bars . further , the only temperature dependence should be a @xmath44 variation of @xmath166 .",
    "an interesting question concerns the thermopower , which is also anomalous in high-@xmath167 materials .",
    "the anomalies in the thermopower have been argued to scale in the same way as the cotangent of the hall angle @xcite however , we do not have a reliable calculation of thermopower in our model .",
    "we turn now to the magnetoresistance , where a troubling discrepancy exists between model and data . assuming the magnetic field does not affect the scattering mechanism we find @xmath168",
    "thus in this model the weak field magnetoresistance is very large compared to the square of the tangent of the hall angle and has an additional temperature dependence .",
    "these results strongly contradict available data @xcite which suggest that @xmath169 is about @xmath170 at all temperatures in optimally doped and underdoped @xmath171 and optimally doped and underdoped @xmath172 .",
    "the observed ratio @xmath173 is much larger in @xmath174 but because this is a very resistive material and we do not know how to interpret these data within our model .",
    "we regard the @xmath171 and @xmath172 as more representative of the intrinsic behavior of high @xmath0 materials .",
    "there are two possible resolutions of this discrepancy .",
    "either the model is simply inapplicable , which seems unlikely in the view of the photoemission results and the successes of the optics , or the anomalous scattering rate is itself field dependent in such a way as to cancel the @xmath175 term in eq .",
    "( [ delta_rho_xx ] ) . because it is likely that the anomalous scattering rate is related to pairing fluctuations a strong @xmath176 dependence of the scattering rate is possible .",
    "we briefly discuss impurity dependence .",
    "we expect @xmath177 with the impurity scattering rate @xmath178 linearly dependent on the defect density @xmath179 .",
    "( [ sigma_xx ] ) for @xmath180 then predicts strong violations of matthiesson s rule : the @xmath181 residual resistivity is predicted to go as the square root of the defect density and the difference @xmath182 in resistivity between two otherwise identical samples with different defect density should be temperature dependent , decreasing as @xmath77 is increased .",
    "neither of these predictions is consistent with available data @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the data mostly involve doping on the @xmath183 site .",
    "such doping is known to drastically change the local environment ( e.g. by inducing magnetic moments on nearby @xmath184 sites @xcite ) .",
    "further , we note that in all available data , doping increases the slope @xmath185 , presumably because the doping changes an effective carrier number .",
    "these effects can not be modelled by simply a @xmath186 to a theory ; therefore we do not regard the inconsistency between the predicted and observed doping dependence of @xmath187 as a definitive disproof of the model we have proposed .",
    "in this section we present a qualitative discussion of a possible origin for the unusual lifetime we proposed .",
    "the angular dependence is reminiscent of that of the @xmath4 superconducting gap ; we therefore propose that the lifetime is caused by interaction of electrons with nearly singular @xmath188 pairing fluctuations .",
    "similar ideas have been proposed by chubukov@xcite . as an example of an interaction which yields the desired behavior we consider @xmath189 with the pair fluctuation propagator @xmath190 given by @xmath191}{% q^{2}+\\xi ^{-2 } }   \\label{d}\\ ] ]    here",
    "@xmath32 is an energy scale , @xmath192 is the usual d - wave form factor and @xmath193 is a scaling function .",
    "the form of @xmath194 is not important ; it is however necessary to assume @xmath195 is convergent and indeed of order unity .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath196 scaling .",
    "this is a nontrivial ( but widely made ) assumption for which we do not have a theoretical justification .",
    "we may construct a one - loop self - energy from the interaction @xmath58 in the usual way .",
    "we have ( here @xmath197 and @xmath198 represent both momentum and frequency )    @xmath199    we are interested in momenta near the zone diagonal where the self energy is small .",
    "we assume @xmath200 .",
    "we may therefore approximate @xmath201 by its weak coupling form @xmath202 .",
    "after integration over the magnitude of @xmath203 we obtain for the imaginary part @xmath204 as a function of position @xmath38 on the fermi line @xmath205    now @xmath206 is peaked at @xmath207 and vanishes as @xmath208 ; thus the integral is dominated by @xmath209 . for @xmath210",
    "we find @xmath211 while for @xmath212 we get @xmath213 .",
    "further the @xmath214 scaling implies @xmath215 .",
    "thus the interaction leads to a scattering rate which is roughly of the form @xmath216 with @xmath217 and @xmath218 as required for the previous analysis .",
    "the empirically determined @xmath219 and @xmath220 implies @xmath221 .",
    "therefore the one - loop approximation may be justified by the usual migdal arguments . within the one - loop approximation the frequency dependence of @xmath222 may be determined ; it is very weak ( logarithmic ) , justifying its neglect in the phenomenological analysis .",
    "the crucial features of the interaction are ( i ) it must be rather sharply peaked about @xmath223",
    "so as not to mix different parts of the fermi surface too strongly , ( ii ) it must be a singular function of @xmath50 , so as to produce a large , essentially @xmath77-independent scattering rate for @xmath38 away from the zone diagonal and ( iii ) the basic scale ( set by @xmath224 ) is @xmath77 .",
    "we expect these assumptions to apply for optimally doped materials . for underdoped materials",
    "we conjecture that the system is closer to an instability , i.e. @xmath225 implying a more singular interaction which leads among other things to a pseudogap in the density of states ( see @xcite for a similar calculation ) .",
    "for overdoped materials we expect at low @xmath77 that @xmath226 ; in this case the analysis leads to a scattering rate proportional to @xmath227 , i.e. one which is @xmath44 everywhere on the fermi surface but is very anisotropic .",
    "here we have also made the additional assumption that this interaction exists in the pairing channel , i.e. it is due to multiple scattering with virtual cooper pairs .",
    "these virtual cooper pairs will lead to a paraconductivity ; we now show that this paraconductivity is negligible in comparison to the normal carrier conductivity found in the previous section .",
    "the paraconductivity @xmath228 is @xmath229 evaluation and restoration of dimensional factors leads to @xmath230 with @xmath231 and @xmath232 if @xmath233 and @xmath234 if @xmath235 ; because we expect @xmath236 this paraconductivity is small compared to the quasiparticle conductivity calculated previously , @xmath237 .",
    "we have considered a model based on `` cold spots '' ; i.e. the idea that the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath238 is unusually short everywhere on the fermi line except near the zone diagonals .",
    "direct evidence for this behavior is found in photoemission experiments . using a boltzmann equation analysis",
    "we have shown that the ansatz @xmath239 with @xmath240 and @xmath241 reproduces quantitatively the observed dc and ac , longitudinal and hall conductivities of optimally doped materials .",
    "we regard it as particularly significant that the model reproduces the non - drude form of the observed optical conductivity ( both the upward curvature at low frequencies and the roughly @xmath242 behavior of @xmath243 and @xmath244 at @xmath245 ) and the difference between longitudinal and hall scattering rates .",
    "there are two differences between model predictions and the data .",
    "the effects of impurity scattering are different than predicted ; however a comparison is difficult because published doping studies have involved substitution on @xmath184 site which produces many confusing changes in the material .",
    "electron damage or light doping on sites away from the @xmath246 planes in _ very clean _ samples would provide a more definite test .",
    "a more troubling discrepancy is the magnetoresistance which is predicted to have a much larger magnitude and stronger temperature dependence than is observed .",
    "we do not at present have a resolution , but the other successes of the phenomenology lead us to believe one may be found .",
    "we also showed that the anomalous lifetime could arise from the exchange of virtual cooper pair fluctuations .",
    "if this is the case , then the anomalous scattering would get weaker in an applied magnetic field , perhaps reducing magnetoresistance .    finally",
    ", we comment on the energy scale , @xmath46 , characterizing the  fermi liquid",
    " scattering rate @xmath247 .",
    "the data imply @xmath248 , a surprisingly small value corresponding to strong scattering even along the diagonals .",
    "( note that the ac hall measurements of ref . @xcite",
    "combined with the observed @xmath44 hall angle dependence directly implies the existence of such small energy scale in the material ) thus for @xmath77 of order room temperature @xmath249 is of the order of the smallest fermion matsubara frequency , @xmath250 , suggesting that even along the diagonals fermi liquid behavior breaks down for @xmath251 .",
    "the small value of @xmath46 implies that even the  fermi liquid ",
