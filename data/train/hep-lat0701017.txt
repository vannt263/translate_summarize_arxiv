    "among its many other applications , finite temperature lattice qcd is a useful tool to study the modification of quark - anti - quark forces n a hot medium .",
    "recent progress in large - scale simulations allowed us to address this problem in qcd with realistic quark masses .",
    "this study is based on a ongoing rbc - bielefeld joint research effort which is fully described in ref.@xcite . here",
    "we will note that calculations are performed at physical strange quark mass and two light quark masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the strange quark mass ; two cutoffs , corresponding to temporal extent @xmath3 were used .",
    "we discuss here the asymptotic large distance behavior of @xmath4 renormalized free energies .",
    "this is a gauge invariant observable .",
    "however , it is most suitable to extract it from a @xmath4 singlet free energy , which is gauge variant and thus has been calculated by us in coulomb gauge @xcite . to extract singlet contribution to the free energy one uses a correlation function of two static quarks , represented by temporal wilson lines , one representing a static quark at @xmath5 and another - a static anti - quark at distance  @xmath6 ,    @xmath7    this is , of course , not the full free energy of the system but the excess free energy which is generated by adding a @xmath8-pair to the hot bath . in the zero temperature limit the singlet free energy defined above coincides with the well known static potential , as demonstrated in e.g. ref . @xcite . at finite temperature @xmath9 gives information about in - medium modification of inter - quark forces and color screening .",
    "both the singlet free energy and the zero temperature static potential are defined up to an additive constant @xmath10 which depends on the lattice cutoff .",
    "our renormalization scheme consists of using the zero temperature potential as normalization at short distances , where the effect of the medium is negligible . in the transition region",
    "we used a cornell - type ansatz for the potential ,    @xmath11    which gives a good parametrization of the lattice data for the zero temperature static potential calculated in ref.@xcite . at much higher temperatures , however , as we probe the free energy at increasingly shorter distances , where the effects of the running coupling can become important , we calculated @xmath12 explicitly at every temperature and used them for normalization .",
    "our results for the singlet free energy and the scaling study have been presented in ref.@xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the large - distance quantities .",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop , the trace of temporal wilson line , @xmath13 , is the order parameter for the deconfining transition in pure gauge theories . in qcd",
    "dynamical quarks the relevant @xmath14 symmetry is broken explicitly and @xmath15 thus is no longer an order parameter .",
    "still it remains an interesting quantity to study the deconfinement transition as it shows a rapid increase in the crossover region @xcite and is one of the ways which can be used to determine the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the unrenormalized polyakov loop defined above strongly depends on the lattice cutoff and has no meaningful continuum limit . on the other hand",
    "a correlator of polyakov loops is a physical quantity and corresponds to the color averaged free energy up to a normalization constant .",
    "due to the cluster decomposition of correlation functions we have , @xmath16 here the normalization constant @xmath10 is the same as in eq.[f1def ] .",
    "moreover , at large distances the relative color orientation of the @xmath4-pair is not important and thus the color singlet free energy and the color averaged free energy approach the same constant value @xmath17 .",
    ", @xmath18 lattices for different quark masses ( left ) and in the entire temperature range ( right),title=\"fig:\",width=313 ] , @xmath18 lattices for different quark masses ( left ) and in the entire temperature range ( right),title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    therefore , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the renormalized polyakov loop as @xmath19 first , in order to check the scaling behaviour , let us concentrate on the transition region . as one can see from fig.[fig : lren_sum ] @xmath20 shows an almost universal behavior as function of @xmath21 for all quark masses studied by us , including the case of three degenerate flavors .",
    "this suggests that in the region of the small quark masses studied here , the flavor and quark mass dependence of the free energy can almost entirely be absorbed in the flavor and quark mass dependence of the transition temperature @xmath22 .",
    "note that the results obtained on @xmath18 lattice are in remarkably good agreement with the results obtained on @xmath23 lattices , indicating again that cutoff effects are small .",
    "for comparison with results obtained using different simulation techniques we refer to ref.@xcite .",
    "for higher temperatures we simulated a large ensemble of @xmath18 ( finite temperature ) . here",
    "results obtained for the static potential at @xmath24 on @xmath25 ( zero temperature ) lattices where used for the normalization .",
    "results for the renormalized polyakov loop are presented on fig.[fig : lren_sum ] ( right ) .",
    "as one can see it shows a rapid change in the temperature region from approximately 180mev to 230mev and almost reaches a plateau at about 400mev .",
    "lattices for @xmath0,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   lattices for @xmath0,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ] [ fig : thermo ]    the excess free energy obviously has a behaviour similar to that of the renormalized polyakov loop through which it was defined .",
    "its variation with temperature defines the excess energy and entropy , respectively , derived from standard thermodynamic relations . as one",
    "can see from fig.[fig : thermo ] the entropy and internal energy have sharp peaks in the transition region .",
    "this can be intuitively understood in a following way : while qcd with non - zero quark masses does not undergo phase transition the crossover is rapid enough to share some important properties , such as enhancement of the long distance correlations .",
    "therefore , adding a @xmath4-pair to such a system would require very large , possibly overlapping , gluonic clouds to screen the color charges , which , in turn , gives rise to the aforementioned peak in the internal energy .    as a phenomenological consequences of this calculation we note that potential models which make use of our data(refs.@xcite,@xcite ) fail to reproduce more rigorous results obtained in ref.@xcite , namely charmonia survival till about @xmath26 with simultaneous dissolution of the @xmath27 .",
    "this shows the need for more refined phenomenological approaches .",
    "we have calculated the singlet free energy of a static @xmath4-pair in qcd with realistic quark masses . we have found that this and related quantities show little cut - off dependence and can be calculated reliably on relatively coarse lattices .",
    "the renormalized polyakov loop derived from the large distance limit of the singlet free energy has been calculated and shown to be in the scaling regime .",
    "the free energy experiences rapid drop in the transition region , which leads to sharp peaks in the excess entropy and internal energy .",
