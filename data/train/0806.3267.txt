    "the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe  @xcite has led to an explosion of interest in the underlying physics responsible for this acceleration .",
    "a favored model characterizes the acceleration by an unknown energy density component , dubbed the dark energy . while there exist a variety of probes to explore the nature of this dark energy , one of the most compelling entails the use of type ia supernovae ( sne henceforth ) to map the expansion history of the universe .",
    "several present and future sn surveys are aimed at constraining the dark energy equation - of - state ( eos ) to better than 10% . with increasing sample sizes",
    ", sn distances can potentially provide multiple independent estimates of the eos of dark energy when binned in redshift @xcite .",
    "given the importance of dark energy measurements , it is then useful to quantify various systematics that impact sn cosmology @xcite .",
    "recently , suggestions have been made that the sn population consists of two components , with a `` prompt '' component proportional to the instantaneous host galaxy star formation rate , and a `` delayed '' ( or `` extended '' ) component that is delayed by several gyrs @xcite .",
    "the former is expected to be more luminous , and thus , prompt sn lightcurves are broader than those of the delayed population . by classifying sne by host galaxy type",
    ", @xcite found a _",
    "pre_-calibration intrinsic luminosity difference of @xmath2% between the two components , based on a difference of @xmath3 in the width of lightcurves . since the sn lightcurves are used to calibrate the intrinsic luminosity @xcite , a systematic difference in intrinsic luminosity",
    "could conceivably be calibrated out , if the sn lightcurve calibration relation is the same for both populations .    however , it is unclear whether the full intrinsic difference in luminosity between the two populations is captured by a calibratable difference in the lightcurves .",
    "a residual in the calibrated luminosity could potentially remain , leading to a redshift - dependent shift in the hubble diagram , and systematic errors in the best - fit cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , it is likely that the intrinsic colors of type ia sne are not uniquely determined by light - curve shape  @xcite .",
    "even if this is not the case , differences in intrinsic color between the populations might introduce systematic differences in post - calibration luminosity ( e.g. , through differences in the extinction corrections ) .",
    "we model the two - population systematic , constraining the magnitude of the effect with current data . with large sn samples",
    "it may be possible to estimate the magnitude of the systematic directly from the data ( e.g. , by correlating observed sn brightnesses with properties of the host galaxies @xcite ) .",
    "we quantify the level of calibration required to avoid significantly degrading the determination of the dark energy eos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in @xmath42 we discuss a model for incorporating a two - population systematic residual luminosity into the hubble diagram . in @xmath43",
    "we investigate the possibility of detecting this systematic from both current and future sn data , and the impact on dark energy parameter estimation .",
    "the use of sne as standardizable candles to constrain the dark energy eos is based on the fundamental assumption that the lightcurves of all individual sne can be calibrated .",
    "the lightcurve shape - intrinsic luminosity relation is derived using low-@xmath5 samples of sne , and it is assumed that this relation is applicable to the higher-@xmath5 population . however ,",
    "if the sn population is non - uniform with redshift , the potential for systematics must be considered  @xcite .    according to the two - population model of @xcite ( henceforth sb ) , the prompt sne track the instantaneous star formation rate , @xmath6 , and dominate the total sn rate at early times ( high redshifts ) when star formation is more active .",
    "the rate of the delayed component scales proportionally to the total stellar mass at a given instant , @xmath7 , and thus delayed sne dominate at late times ( low redshifts ) .",
    "the total sn rate can be written as @xmath8 + b \\left[\\frac{\\dot{m_{*}}(t)}{10^{10}m_{\\sun } \\mbox{gyr}^{-1}}\\right ] \\label{eqn : twopop}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are dimensionless constants .",
    "we take the star formation rate proportional to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this model is likely to be a simple approximation to a true , smooth underlying distribution of delay times  @xcite . for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the two - population model ,",
    "although in  [ s : future_data ] we discuss sensitivity to this assumption .",
    "we allow for a redshift - independent residual difference ( @xmath12 ) in the calibrated absolute luminosities of the prompt ( @xmath13 ) and delayed ( @xmath14 ) sne : @xmath15 .",
    "we take the delayed and prompt fractions of the total sn population to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the average of the distance moduli of all the sne in a given redshift bin can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the reference luminosity corresponding to the reference absolute magnitude @xmath21 given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the redshift - average of @xmath24 over the low redshift range where the calibration is done .",
    "the residual systematic correction to @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the two - population bias .",
    "note that one can also express @xmath28 relative to the prompt component , using @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 , and @xmath31 instead of @xmath32 .",
    "this involves an overall sign change , but the final results are unaltered .    using the @xmath33-statistic , we fit the hubble diagram with a modified form of the distance modulus which includes a possible residual : @xmath34 we have absorbed the redshift - independent term in @xmath28 into the  nuisance parameter \" , @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath36 is incorporated into @xmath37 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "the redshift - dependent factor @xmath16 can be determined based on our knowledge of the star - formation history , and @xmath30 must be estimated directly from the sn data .",
    "this residual systematic must now be marginalized over , and will affect cosmological parameter estimates .",
    "to study the extent to which existing data may be affected by a residual systematic in the luminosity difference between prompt and delayed sne , we model fit a combined data set of 192 sne @xcite .",
    "we also include two baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) distance estimates at @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite , and the dimensionless distance to the surface of last scattering @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we take a flat @xmath41cdm cosmological model and marginalize over @xmath35 , with _",
    "wmap _ priors of @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "these priors are independent of the sn data . for simplicity we do not incorporate the correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath36 .",
    "such a correlation will not qualitatively alter our results , but will need to be taken into account once precision data becomes available .",
    "the distribution function for @xmath30 from existing data has a positive mean value ( @xmath45 ) , implying that the post - calibration luminosity of the delayed population is dimmer than the prompt population by @xmath465% .",
    "the standard deviation of this @xmath30 is @xmath47 , which suggests that current sn data is consistent with the absence of a two - population bias .",
    "the @xcite result of @xmath46 @xmath48% difference in the intrinsic luminosity is a _ pre_-calibration difference .",
    "we find a @xmath49% difference in the _ post_-calibration luminosity between the two types of sne .",
    "while this uncertainty is larger than the pre - calibration value , it is estimated directly from the hubble diagram , and is independent of the empirical stretch - luminosity relation .",
    "this important consistency check will improve as the sn sample sizes increase .",
    "to study the impact of a potential luminosity difference on the measurement of the dark energy eos , we also fit the same data ( sn+bao+cmb ) assuming a @xmath50cdm model , and take the corresponding _ wmap+hst",
    "_ priors @xmath51 and @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "we first consider two extreme cases : ignoring the two - population systematic ( @xmath53 ) , and allowing for a completely unconstrained systematic ( @xmath30 with no priors ) . with @xmath30 free , our analysis yields a best - fit time - independent eos parameter @xmath54 , with a best - fit @xmath55 .",
    "if we set @xmath53 , the same data provides a constraint of @xmath56 . by incorporating a two - population effect in the fit ,",
    "the errors on the best - fit eos degrade by a factor of @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , we note a shift in the best - fit value of @xmath50 between the two cases . _",
    "the evolution in the ratio between prompt and delayed sne , as a function of redshift , can mimic dark energy . _",
    "if there is a residual difference in the calibrated luminosity , ignoring @xmath30 might bias the dark energy estimate . as we show in the left panel of figure  1 , the increase in the error of the best - fit eos is due to the degeneracy between dark energy ( @xmath50 ) and the two - population systematic ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "following @xcite , it may be possible to calibrate out the luminosity difference between the two components with large samples of sne ( e.g. , by looking for characteristic properties in the sn spectra , or by correlating sn luminosities with host galaxy types ) .",
    "this will lead to a prior constraint on @xmath30 , although uncertainties will still remain on the redshift evolution ( as estimated by @xmath16 ) .",
    "assuming the two - population fraction , and its redshift evolution , is perfectly known , we analyze the same sn data assuming a gaussian prior on @xmath30 . taking this prior to have zero mean and @xmath58 , the errors on @xmath50 are ( @xmath59 ) , with the best - fit value of @xmath50 being approximately the same as was found for the @xmath53 case .",
    "thus , by including a two - population systematic in the fit , with a prior on @xmath30 centered at 0 with a 0.05 mag dispersion , we recover the same best - fit @xmath50 , but with @xmath60 degradation in the error bars .",
    "we now turn to proposed sn surveys , and investigate how uncertainties in a possible two - population systematic impact measurements of @xmath50 .",
    "we generate mock sn catalogs with 300 sne uniformly distributed at @xmath61 , and 2000 sne in the range @xmath62 , similar to a _ jdem_-like survey @xcite .",
    "we incorporate an intrinsic gaussian scatter of 0.1 mag for each sn , and take the relative fraction of delayed and prompt sne , @xmath16 , given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : twopop ] with sb values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we assume different values ( 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.1 mag ) for the underlying two - population bias ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we fit each mock data set of 2300 sne , along with the 2 existing bao measurements , to a @xmath50cdm model , with the corresponding @xmath50cdm _",
    "wmap+hst _ priors as before . when fitting the data we consider two extreme cases : @xmath53 , and @xmath30 completely unconstrained .",
    "our results for @xmath65 , from 200 separate mocks , are summarized in the right panel of figure  1 .",
    "the hatched histogram , which peaks at -0.974 , depicts the case where @xmath53 was assumed in the fit .",
    "this corresponds to a systematic being present in the data , but ignored in the fit . with an average error on the eos of 0.029 from mcmc , the resulting bias in the best - fit eos value is @xmath1 from the underlying value ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the shaded histogram in the right panel of figure  1 , having a peak at -0.991 with a @xmath67 width of 0.071 , shows the distribution of the best - fit @xmath50 with 200 mocks , where we let @xmath30 vary freely while fitting the data to eq .",
    "[ eq : dist_mod_fid ] . in this case",
    "we find no significant bias ( @xmath66 is recovered within @xmath68 ) , but the width of the distribution and mcmc results for each mock sample show that the errors in the best - fit @xmath50 increase by a factor of @xmath69 . when the underlying two - population bias is @xmath70 mag , we find @xmath71 ( assuming @xmath53 in the fit ) and @xmath72 ( assuming @xmath30 unconstrained ) based on 50 monte - carlo realizations . generating data with @xmath73 , and neglecting the systematic in the fit , we find @xmath74 ( 50 realizations ) . as a rough rule , if the two - population systematic is neglected , the resulting bias in the best - fit @xmath50 is on the order of the magnitude of the underlying @xmath30 .",
    "thus far we have assumed no prior knowledge on the values of @xmath30 , although it may be possible to adduce _ a priori _ constraints on @xmath30 through sn population statistics combined with correlations to galaxy properties .",
    "we model - fit 200 separate sn mocks ( with intrinsic @xmath65 mag ) with two different priors : @xmath75 and @xmath76 mag .",
    "the former case represents knowledge of the true underlying systematic ( with a @xmath67 uncertainty of 0.025 mag ) , while for the latter case the central value is incorrectly assumed to be zero ( with a @xmath77 mag uncertainty ) . with",
    "the @xmath30 prior peaked on the correct value ( 0.025 ) , the distribution of @xmath50 peaks at @xmath78 with a @xmath67 width of 0.034 ( the gaussian with dot - dashed line in the right panel of figure  1 ) . with the prior centered on the wrong value ( 0 instead of 0.025 ) , the distribution peaks at @xmath79 ( showing a small bias of @xmath80 ) , with the same @xmath67 uncertainty of 0.034 . in both cases the errors in @xmath50 increase by @xmath81 , when compared to the equivalent dataset with no two - population effect in either the mock data or the fit .",
    "thus far we have assumed that we know @xmath16 perfectly . even if the two - population model is correct , uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , or equivalently uncertainties in the star - formation history , lead to a redshift - dependent uncertainty in @xmath16 . to test the effect of these uncertainties on parameter estimation ,",
    "we generate mock data sets with @xmath65 , and @xmath16 taken to be the canonical two - parameter form given in eq .",
    "[ eqn : twopop ] .",
    "we then fit these data assuming different forms for @xmath16 obtained by accounting for uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath10 from sb .",
    "we also consider an estimate of @xmath32 from @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath32 curves are shown in the left panel of figure  2 . in the right panel",
    "we show the resulting bias in dark energy eos measurements , as a result of the uncertainty in @xmath32 .",
    "the uncertainties in the population fraction lead to biases in the resulting eos parameters . to control this bias to the percent level",
    ", the underlying distribution must be characterized to @xmath82 .    in summary , we have found that a post - calibration shift in the standard - candle brightness between delayed and prompt sne can introduce bias in the best - fit dark energy parameters . by controlling the magnitude of any resulting two - population difference to better than 0.025 mag",
