    "numerous transport calculations indicate that in central heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies significant compression and heating of nuclear matter occur in the initial stage of the reaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the expansion of initially hot and compressed matter is thought to result in the development of dynamical instabilities leading to the multifragmentation , i.e. to the formation of a large number of intermediate - mass fragments as it is observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "traces of the pre - equilibrium processes in the disassembling source and the flow energy initially stored in the compressed mode are expected to appear in the fragmentation patterns .",
    "the formed composite system may , in particular , have a non - spherical or even a non - compact configuration which will affect the later stages of the decay process .",
    "such configurations can be the result of a transparency , i.e. of an incomplete stopping of the colliding system , as reported for heavy - ion reactions at intermediate @xcite and high @xcite energies .",
    "the composite system disintegrates into fragments before complete equilibrium has been attained .",
    "although the collision dynamics plays an essential role , general features of the multifragmentation process , especially the fragment partitions , have been successfully described using the equilibrium statistical models @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the system is allowed to explore the phase space of possible partitions into light particles and fragments within an expanded volume . in their standard versions ,",
    "a spherical breakup volume is used which causes the fragment distributions to be isotropic .",
    "while isotropy has been reported for fragmentations initiated with relativistic projectiles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) it is not necessarily a generic property of multifragmentation . in the heavy symmetric collision systems at intermediate energies studied in the present work , non",
    "- isotropic distributions are found to prevail in central collisions if standard methods are used for their identification @xcite .",
    "a selection of subclasses of central events that fulfill the demand of isotropic emission patterns requires additional conditions for global event properties or for specific observables @xcite .",
    "the resulting cross sections are rather small .",
    "angular anisotropies in fragment distributions and kinetic energies are usually considered as an indication for genuine non - equilibrium effects . indeed , dynamical models are able to account for these anisotropies @xcite but it is difficult with these models to assess the degree of equilibration that is otherwise reached at the fragmentation stage of the reaction @xcite . in a general statistical description , on the other hand , the shape degrees of freedom of the emitting sources will have to be included . fluctuations around an average shape and isotropic orientations are expected in the unconstrained case while a preference for non - spherical shapes and non - isotropic orientations may result from dynamical effects .",
    "spherical or near - spherical shapes can still be part of such dynamically constrained ensembles .    in the present paper ,",
    "starting from the observed characteristics of central collisions , an effective deformation of the expanding fragmenting source is considered as a result of an incomplete shape relaxation .",
    "apart from this dynamical imprint , the system is assumed to have attained equilibrium in all other degrees of freedom . the possibility of collective flow , decoupled from the statistical degrees of freedom , is furthermore included . in statistical analyses for the present and similar systems , an additional collective flow component has been shown to be essential for reproducing the fragment kinetic energies @xcite .",
    "customarily , it is superimposed without considering its potential correlation with the partition degree of freedom , an assumption that finds its justification in the successful description of the experimental data that it permits @xcite .    in this framework",
    ", we shall analyze various manifestations of anisotropy in fragment observables from central collisions of + at 50  amev and + at 60 , 80 and 100  amev , measured at gsi with the indra multidetector .",
    "the analysis is performed with the metropolis multifragmentation monte - carlo ( mmmc ) model @xcite which has been extended to non - spherical ( ns ) sources  @xcite , a version referred to in the following as mmmc - ns model .",

    "the experimental data have been obtained during the indra campaign performed at the gsi laboratory in 1998 and 1999 .",
    "beams of and , delivered by the heavy ion synchrotron sis were directed onto @xmath1sn and au targets with areal densities of 1.05  mg/@xmath2 and 2.0  mg/@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the reaction products were detected and identified with the @xmath3 multidetector indra described in detail in @xcite .",
    "for the present campaign , the first ring of the multidetector , covering the polar angles between 2@xmath4 and 3@xmath4 , has been modified in order to improve the energy and charge resolution and to permit the mass identification of light products in the range @xmath5 = 1 to 4 . without changes of the ring geometry ,",
    "the previously used phoswich detectors have been replaced by 12 si - csi(tl ) telescopes , each consisting of a 300-@xmath6 m si detector and a 14-cm - long csi(tl ) scintillator viewed by a photomultiplier .",
    "these new detectors have the same characteristics as those used in the neighbouring indra rings .    in order to verify that the sis beams are properly focused into the 12-mm - diameter entrance hole of indra , annular plastic detectors were placed upstream of the indra detection system , and their signals recorded for vetoing halo events in the off - line analysis .",
    "measurements with empty target frames have also been performed .",
    "the event triggering condition was set to a hit multiplicity greater than 2 over all csi detectors .",
    "this was sufficient to exclude elastic scattering and to suppress other background generated by cosmic rays and natural or induced radioactivity near the detectors .",
    "the energy calibration of @xmath7  particles for the 192 csi(tl ) detectors of the 9 forward - most rings of indra has primarily been derived from a detector - by - detector comparison of spectra obtained in the reaction + at 50  amev with those measured for the same reaction at ganil . there",
    ", calibration data had been obtained by scattering a variety of primary and secondary beams from thick targets @xcite .",
    "the remaining 144 csi(tl ) detectors of rings 10 - 17 have been calibrated using the standard method @xcite based on the silicon calibration telescopes ( one per ring ) : the spectra of @xmath7  particles obtained for each scintillator have been adjusted to those measured simultaneously by the telescopes during an experiment .",
    "the validity of these calibration procedures has been verified for part of the detector by analyzing the spectra of recoil protons from @xmath8h + @xmath9c scattering , obtained with @xmath9c beams of 30  amev and a polyethylene target  @xcite .    in order to calibrate the energies of heavier fragments ( from li to au ) with the use of the calibration parameters obtained for @xmath10-particles for all indra modules ( rings 1 - 17 ) , the light emission from the csi(tl ) scintillators",
    "has been parameterized according to ref .",

    "inclusive spectra of these quantities for the reactions + at 50  amev and + at 60  amev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_etrans12_2 ] .",
    "the hatched areas indicate the groups of central collisions accepted in the present analysis .",
    "they correspond to 1% of the recorded reaction cross section or to reduced impact parameters @xmath14  @xmath15 if a monotonic relation with the impact parameter is assumed .",
    "it is obvious , in particular from the @xmath13  spectra , that these high thresholds favour the tails of the distributions which may be partly caused by the fluctuation widths of @xmath12  and @xmath13  in central collisions rather than by a significant variation of the impact parameter up to the highest values of these variables .",
    "the monotonic relation between @xmath12  and the reduced impact parameter @xmath14  resulting from the geometrical prescription @xcite is linear to a good approximation , with @xmath14  decreasing with increasing @xmath12 .",

    "the multiplicity of intermediate - mass fragments ( @xmath16 ) , represented by the shadings in the figure , is more strongly correlated with @xmath13  than with @xmath12 . for a given total multiplicity @xmath13  or multiplicity of fragments ,",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath12  are rather large .",
    "there is even the indication of a weak anti - correlation between the multiplicity of fragments and @xmath12 ; the largest number of fragments is observed for the region of largest @xmath13  but , at a given bin of @xmath13 , at the smallest @xmath12 .",
    "this observation may reflect the fact that the production of fragments is governed by the amount of energy that is left available in the system and , apparently , subject to a competition with the energy used for light - particle emission .",
    "the figure , furthermore , shows that the central event classes selected with the two criteria are to a large extent mutually exclusive .",
    "the global characteristics of central collisions of + at 50  amev , identified on the basis of either @xmath12  or @xmath13 , are shown in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "they are largely independent of the chosen selection criterion , except for the charged - particle and fragment multiplicities which are higher for the @xmath13  selected event class .",
    "the difference of about 20% reflects the autocorrelation introduced by gating on the multiplicity itself ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mc_etrans12 ] ) . in order to illustrate the effect of the incomplete acceptance of the detector ,",
    "the same observables are also evaluated for the subclass of events for which at least 80% of the system charge has been recovered in the form of detected charged particles and fragments ( values given in parentheses ) .",
    "this additional condition has a slightly larger effect on the @xmath12  selected than on the @xmath13  selected event class . a high multiplicity of charged particles , @xmath17 , and a fraction of about 50% of the system charge bound in fragments characterize this multifragmentation mode .",
    "correspondingly , even the biggest fragments of the partition ( @xmath18 to 15 ) are relatively small , with the next largest fragments rapidly decreasing in charge .",
    "the sum of the transverse kinetic energies of charged particles reaches up to 1.0  gev , of which about two thirds are carried away by light charged particles with @xmath7  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_etrans12_2 ] ) . this dissipation amounts to about one third of a total of 3.1  gev incident energy in the center of mass and , even though neutrons and the separation energies are not included , may be taken as a first hint that the projectile is not completely stopped in these most central collisions .",

    "the calculated alpha - particle correlation function remains also flat in accordance with the measurement ( fig .",

    "were obtained , respectively .",
    "they are caused by the geometrical acceptance of indra ( @xmath37 ) , by thresholds , and by multihits that can not be resolved with the coherency analysis , in the majority multihits of light charged particles in a single detector module .",
    "accordingly , the fragment multiplicity ( @xmath16 ) for @xmath12   selected central events , corrected for instrumental effects , is 6.6 ( @xmath38 for 80% completeness , cf .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the source parameters were determined by adjusting the calculations in a step - wise procedure to the measured mean characteristics of the fragment partitions .",
    "the obtained results were found to be independent of whether the additional condition of @xmath39 charge detection , in both data and filtered calculations , had been requested . in a first step ,",
    "the excitation energy of the source , @xmath40  amev , has been determined by requiring the mean value of the largest fragment charge @xmath20 of the event to be reproduced .",

    "the difference observed for light particles ( @xmath7  ) is presumably caused by pre - equilibrium emissions during early phases of the reaction ( cf .",
    "[ sec : s_elong ] ) .    while the system mass obtained from the mmmc analysis agrees with the smm estimate  @xcite , the excitation energy is slightly lower .",
    "this can at least partly be traced back to the freeze - out volume which in the mmmc - ns model has twice the value used in the smm .",
    "the coulomb energy is correspondingly lower , by about 0.8 amev for the present system , so that the thermal components of the excitation energy which determine the fragment partitions are about equal .",
    "a collective radial flow of the constituents of the source was incorporated into the mmmc - ns code with the parameterization @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the position vector in coordinate space with respect to the center of mass , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53  denote the strength , the scaling radius and the exponent of the flow profile , respectively .",

    "it was found necessary to either permit @xmath53  to differ from unity , i.e. to deviate from the standard hubblean self - similar flow profile @xcite , or to consider non - isotropic strength parameters @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the collective energy is not included in the energy balance , and the flow is thus decoupled from the equilibrium .",
    "this assumption is , e.g. , justified in a quasi - static - expansion approximation in which the expansion is slow as compared to the equilibration time .",

    "in contrast , with the @xmath12  selection , the sideward multiplicities of light particles increase noticeably and become equal to the forward multiplicities .",
    "this is obviously an auto - correlation produced by the selection method . comparing the experimental multiplicities for @xmath7  to the mmmc - ns calculation which are supposed to account for the equilibrium phase",

    ", the strong forward - backward focusing of the heaviest fragments originates from their particular location in the freeze - out volume .",
    "this is a consequence of the minimization of the coulomb energy on an event - by - event basis which favours a concentration of large fragments near the tips of the source and reduces the weight of partitions with high coulomb energy , as , e.g. , with heavy fragments compactly distributed near the center of the freeze - out volume . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rp_maps ] ( middle panels ) , the transversal and longitudinal projections of the yields of heavy fragments ( @xmath72 ) for slices in the coordinate space show that the interior of the source is strongly depleted .",
    "heavy fragments are emitted predominantly from the tips of the ellipsoid close to the surface .",
    "this focusing is enhanced for larger fragment charges but is absent for light charged particles .",
    "since the radial collective flow is directly correlated with the spatial fragment distribution ( see eq .  [ eq : vcoll ] ) , the geometry of the source and its ring structure in the transversal cut are reflected in the velocity space , as shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rp_maps ] .",
    "depending on the relative strengths of the thermal and collective components , this space - momentum correlation is partly smeared out by thermal motion .",
    "an illustration of the decisive role of the coulomb energy is given in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rp_maps ] .",
    "if the coulomb interaction is artificially switched off , heavy fragments are found to be much more homogeneously spread over the freeze - out volume .",
    "there is still a slight concentration near the surface , caused by the geometrical advantage it gives for placing the other fragments of the partition . in this case",
    ", the resulting angular distribution of heavy fragments becomes much flatter and does no longer agree with the experimental observation .      the collective motion is not included in the energy balance of the mmmc - ns model .",
    "therefore , the yield and charge distributions primarily discussed up to now are only weakly dependent on the strength of the included flow ( via the applied filter ) .",
    "because of the radial form of the velocity profile ( eq .  [ eq : vcoll ] ) , also the fragment emission into a given angular interval and the fragment angular distribution are hardly affected .",
    "this is no longer valid if the fragment kinetic energies are considered since they depend directly on the strength of the considered flow .",
    "the observed anisotropies of the kinetic energy distributions may be accounted for with either an angle - dependent strength parameter @xmath54 or , for a non - spherical source , also by adjusting the exponent @xmath53 .",
    "the latter statement is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_dep ] ( left and middle panels ) .",
    "the calculated mean kinetic energy as a function of @xmath5 for the forward and sideward angular regions depends significantly on the exponent @xmath53  of the velocity profile while the angle - independent @xmath51 , adjusted to reproduce the experimental @xmath27 , varies little with @xmath53 .",
    "the anisotropy of the kinetic energy , caused by the source elongation , is strongly enhanced with larger @xmath53 .",
    "the same property is also reflected by the angular dependence of the mean kinetic energy of the largest fragments ( fig .  [",

    "these fragments are mostly placed far from the center of the source and , therefore , have the highest sensitivity to the exponent of the flow profile .",

    "naturally , the forward - backward enhancement of the kinetic energies may also be very satisfactorily accounted for with a non - isotropic strength parameter . for + at 50 amev",

    "the required elongation in velocity space is smaller , as expected . with the same source elongation 0.70:1 that was obtained for the coordinate space ( table  [ tab : table2 ] , prolate+e.f . ) , an equivalent reproduction of the kinetic energies is obtained , even though the values for the largest @xmath5 may be slightly overpredicted ( fig .",

    "the tensor @xmath90 can be represented as an ellipsoid to be described by three axes and by an orientation defined by three angles in the three - dimensional momentum space .",

    "the flow angle is most useful for prolate shapes for which it describes the degree of alignment with respect to the beam axis ( @xmath99 for complete alignment ) .",

    "the coplanarity distribution allows to exclude an oblate source only and does not discriminate between a spherical form and a prolate one : both give close values of the coplanarity @xmath24 . on the other hand , the sphericity distribution can exclude all shapes except the prolate one .",
    "this is valid even for the spherical shape with non - isotropic flow , even though the latter properly describes the kinetic - energy anisotropy . a similar analysis for different values of the exponent of the flow profile , presented for the prolate shape in fig .",
    "[ fig : sph_copl_alpha ] , confirms that @xmath53  =  2 best describes the distributions of fragment momenta in the present reaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath53  has quite a strong effect on the sphericity distribution , because it enhances ( for @xmath100 ) or reduces ( for @xmath101 ) the elongation of a system in the momentum space , as compared to the standard hubblean radial flow .",
    "in contrast , as expected , @xmath53  influences only weakly the coplanarity which measures the azimuthal asymmetries of the prolate events .",
    "a similar comparison has been done for the flow angle distribution ( fig .",

    "it is strongly concentrated at small angles , corresponding to the forward - backward enhancement of heavy fragments ( fig .",

    "the yield at high @xmath80 is slightly too low but can be expected to increase if fluctuations around the mean source deformation are included .",
    "the spherical configuration with anisotropic flow also reproduces the general trend but the agreement with the experiment is only qualitative .",
    "like in the experimental data , mmmc - ns prolate simulations produce , with a small probability , events having high values of @xmath80 .",
    "they correspond to rare partitions with the heaviest fragment being emitted sidewards or to compact arrangements of fragments with near - spherical energy - flow distributions .",

    "the sensitivity to @xmath53  is not very strong but the general trend that the forward - backward focusing of the momentum tensor increases with @xmath53  can , nevertheless , be clearly seen .",
    "given the possibility that the forward - backward enhancement observed for the fragment emission in + might be related to a lack of mutual stopping of the collision partners , an investigation of the mass dependence seems strongly suggested .",
    "a more efficient stopping may result from the larger nuclear radii and masses in even heavier systems .",
    "the present study has , therefore , been extended to the + system at the similar beam energy of 60  amev that was measured as part of the same experimental campaign of indra at gsi @xcite .",
    "the same methods were used for selecting central event samples ( @xmath14  @xmath15 ) according to either @xmath12  or @xmath13  ( cf .",

    "the mean sphericity @xmath103 for + is larger than the corresponding value @xmath104 for + .",
