    "the interplay between statistical mechanics and combinatorics has always been of great interest both for physicists and for mathematician .",
    "the observations of razumov and stroganov in their seminal papers @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and the body of work that followed , exemplifies an instance of such an interplay . what razumov and stroganov found was that the properly normalized components of the ground state of the dense @xmath2 model enumerate classes of so called fully packed loop ( fpl ) configurations of given topology .",
    "the boundary conditions on the @xmath2 model are reflected on the symmetries of the fpl ( see @xcite for further explications ) .",
    "an approach to these problems , that has revealed to be particularly powerful , was initiated by di francesco and zinn - justin @xcite .",
    "they used the integrable structure of the dense @xmath2 model and generalized it by introducing spectral parameters , still preserving integrability .",
    "the advantage in dealing with a more complicated problem was at the beginning a technical one : one could exploit the richer structure coming from the polynomial nature of the ground state of the generalized model to better handle it .",
    "later it was realized that the idea of di francesco and zinn - justin opened new perspective on the problem by relating it to the study of so called qkz equations @xcite and affine hecke algebras @xcite , to algebraic geometry of certain affine varieties @xcite and allowing to push forward some further intriguing conjectures ( in part already proved @xcite ) relating the homogeneous specialization of the solution of certain qkz equation to refined enumeration of plane partitions .    in the present work , we will study the qkz equations related to the so called two boundaries temperley lieb algebra @xcite . when specialized at @xmath3 the solution of such a system of equations is the ground state of the inhomogeneous @xmath2 loop model with so called open boundary conditions . for generic @xmath4 instead",
    ", the problem is related to the study of certain laurent polynomial representations of the affine hecke algebras @xmath5 of type @xmath6 and of the doubly affine hecke algebras of type @xmath7 .",
    "the main difficulty we encounter in dealing with two open boundaries is the absence of a completely factorized component .",
    "the presence of such a component in the cases with other boundary conditions , previously studied , allowed to fix the unknown factor in the recursion relations which in turn allowed to derive the sum rule at the combinatorial point @xmath8 .",
    "here we adopt the opposite strategy , we derive first the recursion relations by a method that circumvent the full knowledge of a component and then we use such recursions to fix the simplest component from which all the other can be derived .    still we will show that at @xmath3 the recursion relations are not sufficient to derive the sum of the components",
    ". therefore we must resort to a different derivation of the whole eigenstate , based on mappings to systems with a single open boundary . this way",
    "we show that the degree is preserved and we compute the sum rule , which is given by the product of four symplectic characters , correcting some recent claims @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ algebra ] we introduce the two boundaries temperley lieb algebra and the representation of this algebra on extended link patterns .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 matrices based on baxterization of the two boundaries temperley lieb algebra , solution of the yang - baxter equation and of the boundary yang - baxter equation , is presented in section [ scatt_matr ] .",
    "then , in section [ qkz - section ] we introduce the qkz equations and explain some of the properties of their solution . in particular in section [ affine_sectio ] we explain the relation between our qkz equations and the representation theory of the ( doubly ) affine hecke algebras of type @xmath11 and in section [ app_rec_bulk ] we derive the recursion relations . in section [ sol_section ]",
    "we concentrate on the case where the parameter @xmath12 of qkz assumes the value @xmath0 , we use in such a case the recursion relations to construct the solution of qkz . the specialization @xmath3 is studied in section [ specialization ] , where we explain how to derive the full solution of the qkz equations with open boundaries from the solution with mixed boundary conditions , by defining certain mappings of representations .",
    "the problem we are going to consider is based on a boundary extension of the well known temperley - lieb algebra , called @xmath13 boundaries temperley lieb algebra @xcite .",
    "the temperley lieb algebra @xmath14 can be defined as the free algebra with generators @xmath15 , for @xmath16 , and relations @xmath17 @xmath18 this algebra has an appealing graphical representation in terms of non crossing link patterns connecting @xmath19 points on the the top and @xmath19 points on the bottom of a finite strip , with the graphical rules        a first extension of the tl algebra is obtained by adding to the generators of @xmath14 a so called boundary operator @xmath20 with the following commutation rules @xmath21 this algebra , which is sometimes called 1btl ( one boundary temperley - lieb algebra ) , appeared for the first time in the paper @xcite where it was called blob algebra , then it was studied in different contexts ( for example @xcite ) . here",
    "we call it @xmath22 since it is naturally related to certain statistical mechanics loop models having closed boundary condition on one side and open boundary conditions on the other side .",
    "graphically the generator @xmath20 can be represented as        and the commutation rules correspond to the following graphical relations        the algebra obtained by adding to the generators of the temperley - lieb algebra a generator @xmath23 `` to the left '' , with commutation relation @xmath24 will be called @xmath25 .",
    "the graphical representation of the generator @xmath23 is similar to the one of @xmath20 and the commutation rules look as follows        in the statistical mechanics model the boundary conditions are now exchanged with respect to the case with @xmath25 .    finally we define the algebra corresponding to open boundary conditions on both sides @xmath26",
    "if we add to @xmath14 both @xmath20 and @xmath23 and require them to commute among themselves . while the algebras @xmath14 , @xmath25 and @xmath22 are finite dimensional , this is not the case for @xmath26 .",
    "it is quite easy to understand why by looking at the graphical representation : the commutation rules given above do not allow to erase the lines connecting the two boundaries .",
    "this means that for example all the element in the following picture have to be considered as distinct .",
    "however it has been proved @xcite that all finite dimensional irreducible representations come from a further the quotient of this algebra which consist in giving a weight @xmath27 to the lines going from one boundary to the other .",
    "algebraically one has to distinguish the case @xmath19 odd and the case @xmath19 even , then introduce the following elements    * * @xmath28 :*   @xmath29  @xmath30 * * @xmath31 : *   @xmath32  @xmath33    and take the quotients over @xmath34 in the rest of the paper we will moreover restrict to the case @xmath35 .",
    "the reason will be explained in appendix [ recursion_bound ] .",
    "the representation of @xmath26 we will be interested in acts on the space @xmath36 with basis labelled by _ extended link patterns_. this is the hilbert space corresponding to open - open boundary conditions .",
    "we call `` extended link pattern '' a diagram with @xmath19 points on a line , numbered from left to right , and two more points , the first called @xmath37 is situated on the left of point @xmath38 ; the second called @xmath39 is situated on the right of point @xmath19 .",
    "the point @xmath40 are either connected in pairs , or they are connected to the point @xmath37 or @xmath39 , by non intersecting curves .",
    "here is an example        the action of the generators @xmath26 is almost obvious from the graphical representation , for simplicity we restrict to the case @xmath41 .",
    "in such a case each time we close a loop in the bulk we remove it and multiply the link pattern by @xmath42 . if instead we close a loop touching one of the two boundaries we simply remove it .",
    "these rules are supplemented by the requirement that a line joining the two boundaries can be removed at the cost of multiplying the obtained link pattern a weight .",
    "we call the weight of the removed line @xmath43 .",
    "graphically this looks as follows        in section [ projection ] we will consider also the representations of @xmath25 on the space of left extended link patterns that we call @xmath44 .",
    "this space is the subspace of @xmath36 consisting of link patterns having no lines connected to the point @xmath39 and is the hilbert space for open - closed b.c .",
    "considered in @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the following @xmath45-matrix 1truecm [ rcheck ]  =  _ i(z , w ) =    ( 0,0 ) ( 85,-5 )    where @xmath46 is the identity operator and @xmath47 ( recall that @xmath48 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 satisfies the yang - baxter equation @xmath50        in a model with boundaries , integrability is assured by the presence of boundary scattering matrix which satisfies the so called boundary yang baxter equation @xcite @xmath51        in the present case the nontrivial boundary conditions on the right are given by a right boundary scattering matrix @xmath52 of a baxterized form @xmath53 .",
    "the nontrivial solutions of the right boundary yang baxter equation form a one parameter family , which in the case of generic @xmath54 reads [ boundary_scatt ] k_r(_r|z ) = . with @xmath55 in the case @xmath56 , which turns out to be the most interesting one for us and to which we restrict from now on , we have @xmath57 and the boundary scattering matrix reduces to k_r(_r|z ) = .",
    "we consider left boundary scattering matrices as well but , in order to formulate the qkz equations , we require them to satisfy a modified boundary yang baxter equation in which we have a new parameter @xmath12 @xmath58 the explicit form of the left scattering matrices when @xmath59 is k_l(_l|z ) = .",
    "given the representation of @xmath26 on the space of extended link patterns , let us consider a function @xmath60 from @xmath61 to this space .",
    "the boundary qkz equations are the following set of equations for @xmath62 [ qkz1 ] _ i(z_i+1,z_i)(_l;z_1 ,  , z_i , z_i+1 ,  , z_n;_r ) = ( _ l;z_1 ,  , z_i+1 , z_i ,  , z_n;_r ) ; [ qkz2 ] k_r(_r|z_n)(_l;z_1 ,  , z_n;_r ) = ( _ l;z_1 ,  , 1/z_n;_r ) ; [ qkz3 ] k_l(_l|z_1)(_l ; z_1 ,  , z_n_r ) = ( _ l;s / z_1 ,  , z_n_r ) ; we expand now these equations on the natural basis of extended link patterns .",
    "therefore we write @xmath63 where the sum runs over all the extended link patterns .",
    "since given an extended link pattern , the notion of an arc opening or closing at a point is well defined , we will parameterize it by the location of open and closing arcs and use the following notation @xmath64 , each @xmath65 or @xmath66 standing for `` opening '' or `` closing '' .",
    "a concrete example of our notation is 1truecm @xmath67    ( 0,0 ) ( 70,-5 )    it is useful to introduce the following operators on the space of laurent polynomials of @xmath19 variables @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 these operators allows us to rewrite the qkz equations for the components of @xmath60 in the extended link patterns basis as follows .    * from eq.([qkz1 ] ) it follows that if @xmath71 then we have @xmath72 otherwise , if @xmath73 then @xmath74 where the coefficients @xmath75 are defined by @xmath76 and can be either @xmath43 if in applying @xmath15 to @xmath77 we form a line joining the two boundaries or @xmath38 in case we do not form a line joining the two boundaries . * from eq.([qkz2 ] ) it follows that if @xmath78 then @xmath79 if @xmath80 there is only one preimage under @xmath20 different from @xmath81 itself , i.e. there is only one @xmath82 such that @xmath83 and the components of this preimage is given by @xmath84 the coefficient @xmath85 now is either @xmath43 if by applying @xmath20 to @xmath77 we form a line joining the two boundaries , or otherwise it is equal to @xmath38 . * finally from eq.([qkz3 ] ) it follows that if @xmath86 then @xmath87 if @xmath88 its preimage under @xmath23 , different from @xmath81 itself is unique @xmath89 the coefficient @xmath90 now is either @xmath43 if by applying @xmath23 to @xmath77 we form a line joining the two boundaries , or otherwise it is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "it is known , from the seminal papers @xcite , that the qkz equations are related to the representation theory of affine hecke algebras .",
    "this has been rediscovered recently in the context of the razumov stroganov conjecture @xcite .",
    "let us explain this observation in our case ; this will lead us to consider the laurent polynomial representations of affine hecke algebras of type c introduced by noumi @xcite .",
    "we start from eq.([qkz1 ] ) , and introduce different generators of the @xmath91 algebra @xmath92 . by recombining the terms of eq.([qkz1 ] ) we can rewrite it as @xmath93 where the operator @xmath94 acts on the polynomial part of @xmath95 .",
    "we proceed in the same way for the other two qkz equation , by introducing two generators @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 .",
    "then we can rewrite eqs.([qkz2],[qkz3 ] ) as @xmath99 the operators @xmath100 and @xmath101 , like the @xmath102 , act on laurent polynomials and are given by @xmath103 @xmath104 it is now a matter of some straightforward computations to show that the operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 satisfy separately the commutation relations of the generators of the affine hecke algebra @xmath107 of type @xmath6 @xmath108 indeed the representation of @xmath107 given by @xmath109 is well known and goes under the name of noumi representation ( actually in the noumi representation the parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath4 are independent ; see for example proposition 2.2 of @xcite ) . by adding also the operators @xmath112 , whose action on a polynomial is the multiplication by @xmath113 we obtain a representation of the doubly affine hecke algebra of type @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "in the qkz equation , we are considering the action of two copies of the @xmath107 , one acting on @xmath36 , the other acting on a space of polynomial that for the moment we call @xmath115 .",
    "then the vector @xmath95 can be interpreted as a map from @xmath36 to the dual of @xmath116 @xmath117 and the qkz equations simply state that it intertwines between the two representation .",
    "therefore , since the representation on @xmath36 is irreducible @xcite , we conclude that @xmath118 .",
    "this means that solving the qkz equations amounts first to find the irreducible representation of @xmath107 on laurent polynomials , dual to @xmath36 , and then to find the basis dual to the extended link pattern basis of @xmath36 .      from eq.([qkz1comp1 ] ) it follows that a component in which the points @xmath119 and @xmath120 are not connected , will have the following form @xmath121 where @xmath122 is symmetric under exchange @xmath123 . in general if the consecutives points @xmath124 are not connected among themselves then @xmath125 and @xmath126 is symmetric in @xmath127 .",
    "analogously , from eq.([qkz2comp1 ] ) , it follows that if the point @xmath19 is not connected to the right boundary @xmath39 then one has @xmath128 where @xmath129 is invariant under @xmath130 .",
    "an analogous statement relative to the left boundary is true , namely if the point @xmath38 is not connected to the left boundary @xmath37 then the component can be written as @xmath131 where now @xmath132 is invariant under @xmath133 .",
    "one can combine the previous remarks in order to extract more trivial factors .",
    "for example the components having all the bulk points connected to the right boundary @xmath134 or to the left boundary @xmath135 have the following form @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a function symmetric under exchange @xmath139 and invariant under @xmath140 , while @xmath141 is a function symmetric under exchange @xmath139 and invariant under @xmath142 .      as a consequence of the analysis in the previous section",
    ", it follows that if we set @xmath143 , all the components of the solution of the qkz equation at length @xmath19 that do not lie in the image of @xmath15 are zero .",
    "the subspace of @xmath26 with an arc between points @xmath119 and @xmath120 is isomorphic to the space @xmath144 .",
    "more precisely , if we call @xmath145 the map @xmath146 which consists in adding an arc between @xmath147 and @xmath119 ( and renumbering the points ) , then @xmath145 is an isomorphism between @xmath144 and @xmath148 . since @xmath149 we can consider its preimage under @xmath145 .",
    "we show now that such a preimage , @xmath150 , satisfies a set of modified qkz equations . in order to work this out",
    "let us restrict for the moment to the case @xmath151 , i.e. when we add a small arc at right the end of our strip .",
    "it is easy to show that the map @xmath152 intertwines the operators @xmath153 and @xmath154 acting on @xmath144 and the ones acting on @xmath148 ( by abuse of notation we do not adopt a different notation for operators acting on different spaces ) @xmath155 then let us consider the following matrix @xmath156 when this matrix acts on configurations in the image of @xmath157 , it can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 .",
    "moreover if we notice that @xmath160        we obtain that @xmath152 intertwines between @xmath161 and @xmath162 @xmath163 therefore @xmath164 satisfies a modified set of qkz equations where eq.([qkz2 ] ) is substituted by the following equation [ qkz2modif ]    c k_r(_r|z_n-2 ) p^-1_n-1_n (  , z_n-2,z_n-1 , z_n = q^2 z_n-1 ,  ) + = p^-1_n-1_n (  , 1/z_n-2,z_n-1 , z_n = q^2 z_n-1 ,  )    now let us suppose that we can find a function @xmath165 which is invariant under @xmath166 and such that @xmath167 then we have that @xmath168is a solution of the unmodified qkz equations ( [ qkz1],[qkz2],[qkz3 ] ) of length @xmath169 and .",
    "therefore , apart from a factor independent from all the @xmath170 , it must be equal to @xmath171 @xmath172    since we are searching for laurent polynomial solutions of the qkz we require the function @xmath165 , solution of eq.([rel_rec ] ) , to be also a laurent polynomial .",
    "this fixes the possible form of @xmath12 as function of @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , in order to cancel the pole at @xmath173 in eq.([rel_rec ] ) , the function @xmath165 must be of the form @xmath174 the product must be such that the last term cancels the pole at @xmath175 .",
    "this happens only if @xmath176 .",
    "in section [ sol_section ] we will argue that the lowest value of @xmath177 for which it is possible to find a solution of the qkz equations is @xmath178 or @xmath0 .",
    "in such a case the recursion relation takes the form @xmath179 with @xmath180 this is the recursion relation we were searching for",
    ". it will be very important in the next section when we will construct a solution of the qkz equations .",
    "actually we will need as well an analogous formula when we set @xmath181 for @xmath182 . of course we could repeat almost word by word the same derivation using this time a modified left boundary scattering matrix .",
    "however , in doing so we would not be able to keep track of the normalization choice of the wave function @xmath95 , which is implicit in the function @xmath183 . we can avoid this problem by deriving the recursion relation when @xmath143 from the case @xmath151 .",
    "the idea is simply to use eq.([qkz1 ] ) to move the spectral lines .",
    "if we act on @xmath184 with the operator @xmath185 we obtain        @xmath186 @xmath187 @xmath188 where the second equality follows from the recursion relation proved above . then we notice that when we act with @xmath189 on @xmath190 we have @xmath191 with @xmath192 this property can be restated in terms of intertwinings , just by substituting @xmath157 with @xmath152 in the l.h.s . and @xmath193 with @xmath194 in the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([transport1 ] )",
    ". therefore we arrive at @xmath195 we can continue this way and move the lines @xmath196 and @xmath19 to the position @xmath119 and @xmath120 . by shuffling the indices we obtain therefore @xmath197 where the hats in the right hand side mean that the variables are removed .",
    "we search for a solution of the qkz equations ( [ qkz1],[qkz2],[qkz3 ] ) , in the simplest situation , i.e. when we have only two internal points ( @xmath198 ) . for the moment",
    "we leave the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath199 free and we will see whether they will be fixed by the solution .",
    "let us start from the components @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "we have seen in section [ trivial_factors ] that they have the form reported in equation eqs.([factor - right ] , [ factor - left ] ) .",
    "some tedious but straightforward calculations show that if we demand the laurent polynomials @xmath202 and @xmath203 to be constant in the @xmath113 , then there are no solutions of the qkz equation . if instead we allow the @xmath204s to be of degree width @xmath38 , we see that the requirement that @xmath205 determines @xmath0 and fixes completely ( except of course for an irrelevant global constant normalization ) both @xmath206 and @xmath207 @xmath208 @xmath209 we find @xmath210 by applying @xmath211 to @xmath212 @xmath213 then the qkz equations close if we have @xmath214 these conditions are satisfied only if @xmath215 .",
    "armed with this simple solution we try to construct the solution at @xmath216 .",
    "we notice that the representation of @xmath26 on extended link patterns at @xmath217 and @xmath218 is irreducible , therefore the discussion in section [ affine_sectio ] tells us that if we know a component of @xmath219 , then using the qkz equations as in @xcite we can reconstruct all the other components .",
    "it turns out that making some minimal assumptions we are able to construct @xmath220 . for this",
    "we have to come back to the bulk recursion relations of section [ app_rec_bulk ] . in order for them to be really useful",
    "we need to determine as much as possible the unknown factor @xmath221 .",
    "first of all using the qkz equation ( [ qkz1 ] ) we have @xmath222 moreover if we specialize at @xmath223 we have @xmath224 applying the bulk recursion relation to the left hand side and comparing it to the right hand side ( where we use eq.([factor - right ] ) ) we find a factor of @xmath225 @xmath226 repeating the same argument using @xmath227 and the recursion relation for @xmath228 we obtain a further factor @xmath229 then we assume that @xmath221 is only given by the product of the two factors above . with this expression for @xmath221 ,",
    "the recursion relation for @xmath230 reads @xmath231 where @xmath232 the further assumption that we make is that these recursion relations completely fix @xmath230 . in section [ reconstruction ] we will show how to construct the solution of our qkz equation in the special case @xmath233 , using the known solution of the problem with mixed boundary conditions .",
    "the solution we will found has a degree width @xmath234 in each variables @xmath113 , which means that the degree width of @xmath230 in each variables @xmath113 is @xmath235 .",
    "if we suppose that the same remains true for generic @xmath4 at @xmath0 then the bulk recursion relations allow to fix @xmath230 completely .",
    "indeed thanks to its symmetries , once given eq.([ref_phi ] ) , we know the values of @xmath230 for @xmath236 .",
    "we have constructed @xmath230 , using lagrange interpolation in @xmath237 , up to @xmath238 .",
    "it is actually quite remarkable that the interpolating formula turns out to be a laurent polynomial in the other variables even though it does nt look of this form .",
    "this is also the case for all its expected symmetries .",
    "once @xmath239 known , we have checked up to length @xmath238 that the qkz equations hold .",
    "we believe that some representation theoretical argument should prove that the construction is valid for generic @xmath19 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , when the parameter @xmath240 assumes the value @xmath241 , the solution of the qkz equation is also an eigenvector of the transfer matrix of the dense @xmath2 loop model with open boundary conditions .",
    "let us recall this fact here briefly .",
    "let us consider the lattice in the following picture        the strip has horizontal length @xmath19 and vertically it extends to infinity .",
    "each face in the bulk of the lattice is filled with the following configurations        with probabilities @xmath242 and @xmath243 , while the boundary faces can be in the following configurations        with probability @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "the end points of the lines on the bottom boundary are labelled from @xmath38 to @xmath19 .",
    "we are interested in the probability of the connectivity patterns of such boundary points : a point @xmath119 is connected by a line either to another point @xmath248 or to the left boundary or to the right boundary .",
    "therefore these connectivity patterns are encoded by the extended link patterns defined in the section [ extended ] . the standard way to deal with the question of finding the probability of a link pattern is trough a transfer matrix approach .",
    "if one adds to the bottom a further double row as in the picture        the probabilities of the different link patterns must be preserved .",
    "this means that the vector @xmath249 of probabilities is an eigenvector of the double row transfer matrix defined above , with eigenvalue equal to @xmath38 .",
    "one can show the integrability of this model by constructing a family of commuting transfer matrices @xmath250 , depending on a `` horizontal '' spectral parameter .",
    "for this one need to introduce introduce the r and k matrices , which parametrise the probabilities by means of the spectral parameters , as in done for example in @xcite .",
    "the existence of a family of commuting transfer matrices is a consequence of the yang - baxter and boundary yang - baxter equations .",
    "this remains true even if we consider different bulk and boundary spectral parameters on each vertical spectral line @xcite and the double row transfer matrix depends on such parameters : @xmath251 .",
    "when we restrict to the homogeneous problem ( all the vertical spectral parameters equal to @xmath38 ) it is not difficult to show that the following hamiltonian @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath254 , commutes with the transfer matrix .",
    "this is consequence of the fact that apart from a constant term one has @xmath255    the vector of probabilities is an eigenvector of @xmath256 with eigenvalue equal to zero , i.e. is the stationary measure of the stochastic matrix @xmath257 .",
    "closed boundary conditions , for example to the right , are obtained by sending the boundary spectral parameter @xmath258 . if we consider systems with mixed boundary conditions ( closed - open or open closed ) or with closed bcs on both sides we can perform also only a partial homogeneous specialization .",
    "for example if we have open bcs on the right and closed on the left we can take all the spectral parameters equal to 1 except the boundary one and the last bulk one .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian ( i.e. the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix in @xmath259 ) assumes again a simple form @xmath260 where @xmath261 .",
    "this remark will be important in the following when we will prove certain mappings between the vectors @xmath95 with different boundary conditions and different size .",
    "the general problem of finding the stationary measure in presence of different spectral parameter is strictly related to the qkz equations ( see @xcite for an extended discussion ) .",
    "indeed the eigenvector of the transfer matrix @xmath262 can be normalized in such a way it is a polynomial in the spectral parameters .",
    "moreover as a simple consequence of the ybe and of the bybe , at @xmath233 we have @xmath263 @xmath264 @xmath265 this means that ( by slightly changing the normalization , which makes it a laurent polynomial ) @xmath262 satisfies the qkz equations .",
    "notice that at @xmath233 all the loops have weight @xmath38 .      at the special point @xmath233 we can compute the sum rule for the components in the basis of extended link patterns . at this special point",
    "each operator @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 has an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath38 in the dual representation on @xmath266 , given by @xmath267 , where the sum extends to all the the link patterns .",
    "this means that we have @xmath268 the sum of the components of @xmath95 is given by @xmath269 as a consequence of the qkz equation and of eq.([lefteigen ] ) we have @xmath270 @xmath271 and analogously @xmath272 therefore @xmath273 is a symmetric laurent polynomial invariant under @xmath274 of degree width @xmath234 in each variable , hence it determined by the values at @xmath275 distinct values of say @xmath237 .",
    "the bulk recursion relations ( combined with the symmetry of the polynomial under exchange @xmath276 ) provide us with the value of @xmath277 at @xmath278 , which means only at @xmath279 points .",
    "but this is not enough to construct @xmath273 by lagrange interpolation .",
    "moreover it is also possible that at @xmath233 there could be some accidental simplifications leading to the appearance of a common factor in the solution of qkz for @xmath4 generic .",
    "such a common factor should be canceled if one consider the lowest degree solution .",
    "the aim of the following sections is to explain how to determine @xmath273 following a different path and will be the consequence of a stronger result . the idea will be to reconstruct the full vector @xmath219 from the knowledge of the solution of the qkz equations with a closed boundary conditions on the left and open on the right . for this",
    "we need to construct certain intertwining maps which is done in the next subsection .      from its definition",
    "one can think for example at the algebra @xmath25 as a subalgebra of @xmath26 . however in the case",
    "@xmath280 we can think at it as a quotient of @xmath26 or of @xmath281 .",
    "indeed one obtains @xmath25 from @xmath26 by quotienting the relation @xmath282 , or from @xmath281 by relabelling @xmath283 and quotienting over the missing relation i.e. @xmath284 . in the present section",
    "we want to implement this idea at the level of representations .",
    "we construct a map : @xmath285 , which intertwines between the representation of @xmath25 and the one of @xmath26 with @xmath286    at a graphical level the map @xmath287 is obtained as follows : starting from the right remove the first two lines connected to @xmath39 and connect the unmatched points with an arc .",
    "if the initial number of lines emanating from @xmath39 was even , repeat this procedure with the remeaning lines joining @xmath39 until the lines from @xmath39 are exhausted .",
    "if the number of lines from @xmath39 was odd repeat the procedure until there is a single line connected to @xmath39 then remove this line and connect the unmatched bulk point with the left boundary @xmath37 .",
    "here is an example        the map @xmath287 is easier to visualize if we use a different diagrammatic representation of the components , in terms of doubly - blobbed arcs @xcite , then @xmath287 simply consists in removing the right blobs .",
    "the other map we want to define is @xmath288 , which intertwines @xmath20 and @xmath157 @xmath289 at the diagrammatic level the map @xmath290 goes as follows : change the name of the the point the right boundary point @xmath291 .",
    "if there are no lines connected to @xmath292 draw a line from it to @xmath37 .",
    "if there are more than two lines connected to @xmath292 remove the second and the third one starting from the right and draw an arc connecting the unmatched bulk points . repeat this procedure until there are either one or two remaining lines . in the former case do nothing , while in the latter case remove the left most line and connect the unmatched bulk point with the left boundary @xmath37 .",
    "here is an example        the proof of eqs.([quoz1 ] , [ quoz2 ] ) is a tedious but strightforward graphical case by case analysis .",
    "now we use the maps @xmath287 and @xmath290 to reconstruct @xmath219 from the known form of the solution of qkz with mixed boundary conditions @xcite and gain information on the sum rule .",
    "first of all we notice that ( with a slight abuse of notation ) @xmath293 therefore we find that @xmath294 satisfies the qkz equations with mixed closed - open boundary conditions",
    ". therefore it must be @xmath295 where @xmath296 is a symmetric polynomials in the @xmath113s invariant under @xmath297 and @xmath298 is the known solution of the qkz equations with mixed b.c .",
    "@xcite . moreover since we have @xmath299 , where @xmath300 and the sum runs over all right extended link patterns , we obtain for the sum rule @xmath301 in @xcite it is proven that @xmath302 , this means that we have found two factors of the sum rule @xmath303 where @xmath304 is the symplectic character @xmath305 in order to find the other factors , we use the map @xmath290 . as done above with @xmath306 one can prove that @xmath307 where now @xmath308 is solution of the qkz equations with mixed boundary conditions at size @xmath292 and the parameter @xmath309 plays the role of a bulk spectral parameter .",
    "we have also @xmath310 , and using again the results of @xcite we obtain for the sum rule @xmath311 to conclude the derivation we notice that these four factors exhaust the degree of @xmath273 ( and do not have common factors ) , therefore @xmath312 let us notice that eqs.([part_sum1],[part_sum2 ] ) provides us also with a way of finding all the components of @xmath313 without the need of solving the qkz equations for generic @xmath4 .",
    "let us show this in a concrete example at @xmath216 .",
    "component wise eq.([part_sum1],[part_sum2 ] ) read @xmath314 @xmath315",
    "@xmath316 @xmath317 this system of equations is immediately solved @xmath318 @xmath319 @xmath320 giving an alternative way of computing the components of the ground state of the dense @xmath2 model with open boundary conditions .",
    "we do not have a proof that this method allows to reconstruct the full ground state for a generic system size @xmath19 , but we have checked it up to @xmath238 , checking as well that the result coincide with the ones found by solving the qkz equation and then taking the limit @xmath321 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the qkz equations related to the baxterization of the two boundaries temperley lieb algebra . by deriving a recursion relation satisfied by their solution we have been able to construct it explicitly . at the combinatorial point",
    "@xmath322 the solution of the qkz equations is also the ground state of the dense @xmath2 loop model with open boundary conditions .",
    "we have shown how to reconstruct this ground state starting from the ground state of the same model with mixed boundary conditions known from @xcite . in doing that we have also been able to prove the sum rule . in section [ affine_sectio ]",
    "we have briefly discussed the relations between our problem and the theory of representation of ( doubly ) affine hecke algebras of type @xmath323 .",
    "it would be interesting to develop further this observation , in particular making contact with a recent work of kasatani @xcite and hopefully with the theory of non symmetric koornwinder - macdonald polynomials",
    ". it would be also interesting to find integral formulae as already done in the case of other boundary conditions @xcite in this paper we have only tangentially touched problems related to the combinatorics behind the homogeneous limit of the ground state of the @xmath2 model . in facts",
    "it is not difficult to see that , making use of the mapping between model with different boundary conditions , one can easily explain certain observation reported in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "we plan to come back to such matters and to generalization to even more exotic boundary conditions in the immediate future .",
    "it is a pleasure for us to thank p. zinn - justin for many fruitful discussions .",
    "we thank also the lptms ( umr 8626 du cnrs ) universit paris sud , where part of this work was done .",
    "we acknowledge the financial support of the anr programs `` gimp '' anr-05-blan-0029 - 01 and `` sle '' anr-06-blan-0058 - 01 .",
    "in this appendix we want to derive a boundary recursion relation similar to the bulk one , the motivation being twofold .",
    "on one side we show that leaving the boundary weight @xmath54 free , the boundary recursion relation maps the solution of qkz at size @xmath19 to a solution of qkz at size @xmath196 and @xmath324 .",
    "this provides a motivation to restrict to the case @xmath56 ( and similarly @xmath59 ) . on the other side",
    "the recursion we find provides the most convenient way to write the laplace interpolation formula giving the unknown factor @xmath325 of @xmath326 . from the analysis of section [ trivial_factors ] adapted to the case @xmath327",
    ", it follows that if @xmath328 or @xmath329 then all the components in which the point @xmath19 is not connected to the right boundary @xmath39 are zero .",
    "the other components , namely the ones having an arc going from @xmath19 to @xmath39 are in one to one correspondence with the extended link patterns with one bulk point removed .",
    "one simply removes the point @xmath19 and the arc from it to @xmath39 .",
    "we call this map @xmath330 . in this section",
    "we show that @xmath331 satisfy a modified qkz equation .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the case @xmath332 , the other one being completely analogous .",
    "first of all we notice that @xmath333 satisfies the qkz eqs.([qkz1 ] ) for @xmath334 and eq.([qkz3 ] ) , these properties being a trivial consequence of the fact that @xmath335 satisfies the same equation .",
    "then let us consider the following operator @xmath336 we see easily that @xmath337 as one expected , @xmath338 preserves the image of @xmath20 ( which are the components not identically zero when @xmath339 ) therefore if we let it act only on such a subspace we see that it assumes the following form @xmath340 where @xmath341 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 and @xmath344 is the same as @xmath345 in which we substitute @xmath54 with @xmath346 .",
    "apart from the multiplicative factor in front of it , this has just the same form of the scattering matrix in eq.([boundary_scatt ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the algebra of operators @xmath23 , @xmath347 and @xmath348 is a @xmath349 with boundary loop weight @xmath350 . from now on we will restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath35 .",
    "this implies in particular @xmath351 and we can write @xmath352 we conclude therefore that @xmath333 satisfies the following set of equations _",
    "i < n-1(z_i+1,z_i ) p_r_n (  , z_i , z_i+1 ,  , z_n = q/_r ) = p_r(z_i+1 , z_i ,  , z_n = q/_r ) ; k_r(q^3/_r|z_n-1 ) p_r_n(",
    " ,z_n-1,z_n = q/_r;_r ) = p_r_n(  ,1/z_n-1,z_n = q/_r;_r ) ; k_l(_l|z_1 ) p_r_n(_l;z_1, ",
    ",z_n = q/_r;_r ) = p_r_n(_l ,",
    "s / z_1  ,z_n = q/_r;_r ) ; where @xmath353 . now let us suppose that we can find a function @xmath354 which is invariant under @xmath166 and such that @xmath355 then it is straightforward to see that @xmath356 is solution of the unmodified qkz equation with boundary parameter @xmath357 .",
    "if we require that the solution @xmath165 of eq.([rel_rec1 ] ) is a laurent polynomial in @xmath358 , then we find that the parameter @xmath12 must be of the form @xmath359 and it is easy to check that the solution is @xmath360 therefore , calling @xmath361 we can rewrite eq.([rec1 ] ) as follows @xmath362 where @xmath363 is an unknown function of @xmath364 and @xmath309 , that we can fix for @xmath0 to be@xmath365 by using minimality arguments similar to the ones employed in section [ sol_section ] .",
    "now we want to change a bit perspective on the role of the boundary parameter @xmath309 ; as a consequence of the bulk recursion relations , it follows that the function @xmath366 is a laurent polynomial in @xmath309 , invariant under @xmath367 and degree width @xmath368 .",
    "this means that we can use the boundary recursion relation in order to construct @xmath369 by using lagrange interpolation in @xmath309 and the symmetries of @xmath369 under exchange of the @xmath113s .",
    "forgetting a constant normalization factor that we can not fix , the result reads @xmath370 it is remarkable that this expression turn out not only to be a laurent polynomial in the spectral parameters @xmath113 , but it is also endowed with all the symmetry properties expected for @xmath371 .",
    "we have checked for that for systems up to size @xmath238 , starting from the above expression one gets a solution of the qkz equations .",
