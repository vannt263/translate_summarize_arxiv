    "pion polarizabilities are the fundamental structure parameters characterizing the behavior of the pion in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "dipole polarizabilities arise as @xmath14 terms in the expansion of the non - born amplitudes of compton scattering in powers of the initial and final photon energies @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in terms of the electric @xmath17 and magnetic @xmath18 dipole polarizabilities , the corresponding effective interaction has the form : @xmath19    the dipole polarizabilities measure the response of the hadron to quasistatic electric and magnetic fields . in",
    "what follows , these parameters are given in units @xmath20 .",
    "the values of the pion polarizabilities are very sensitive to the predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "therefore , an accurate experimental determination of them is very important for testing the validity of such models .    at present , the value of the difference of the charged pion dipole polarizabilities found from radiative @xmath21 meson photoproduction from protons @xcite is equal to @xmath22 and close to the value obtained from scattering of high energy @xmath23 mesons off the coulomb field of heavy nuclei in serpukhov @xcite and equal to @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "these values differ from the prediction of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) ( ( @xmath25 ) @xcite ) .",
    "the experiment of the lebedev physical institute on radiative pion photoproduction from protons @xcite has given @xmath26 .",
    "this value has large error bars but nevertheless shows a large discrepancy with regard to the chpt predictions , as well .",
    "the preliminary result of the compass collaboration @xmath27 has been found by studying the @xmath23 meson scattering off the coulomb field of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "this result is more close to the chpt prediction .",
    "however to obtain this result the authors used very big values of momentum transfer @xmath28(gev / c)@xmath29 . in this region an interference between the coulomb and nuclear amplitudes should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the authors of work @xcite chose @xmath30 ( gev / c)@xmath29 to guarantee that the contribution of the strong interaction below the coulomb peak is negligible .",
    "the charged pion polarizabilities can be also found by studying the process @xmath1 .",
    "investigation of the process @xmath31 at low and middle energies was carried out in the framework of different theoretical models and , in particular , in the frame of dispersion relations ( dr ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the processes @xmath2 and @xmath1 using drs with subtractions for the invariant amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 without partial - wave expansions .",
    "the subtraction constants have been uniquely determined in these works through the pion polarizabilities .",
    "the values of the polarizabilities have been found from the fit of the experimental data of the processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 up to 2500 mev and 2250 mev , respectively . as a result , we have found @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the result for @xmath11 is in good agreement with the values obtained in ref.@xcite whereas it is at variance with the chpt prediction .    in the works @xcite the dipole polarizabilities of charged pions",
    "have been determined from the experimental data of the process @xmath1 in the full energy region @xmath36 mev , ( where @xmath37 is the square of the total energy in @xmath38 c.m . system ) .",
    "the results obtained in these works are close to chpt predictions @xcite .",
    "however , the values of the experimental cross section of the process @xmath1 in this region @xcite are very ambiguous , and , as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , even changes of these values by more than 100% are still compatible with the present error bars .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider other additional possibilities of the @xmath11 determination .",
    "such an information could be obtained from the dispersion sum rules ( dsr ) for these parameters .",
    "however , the main contribution to dsr for @xmath11 is given by the @xmath3 meson , which is very wide and this causes additional uncertainties in the dsr calculation .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider the dsr for the difference between the charged and neutral meson polarizabilities @xmath39 , then the contribution of mesons with isotopic spin @xmath0 in the @xmath37 channel to this difference would be equal 0 @xcite , when the masses of charged and neutral @xmath40 mesons are equal each other . as a result , a model dependence for @xmath11 should be decreased essentially .    in the present work we investigate dsr for @xmath41 as a function of the decay width of @xmath42 , when the masses of the charged and neutral @xmath40 mesons are not equal each other . as will be shown , the contribution of the @xmath43 meson is small in this case too , and we can find a realistic limit on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "it has been shown that the value of the decay width of the @xmath9 meson into @xmath10 can be found if the value @xmath41 is reliably determined from experiment .",
    "we will consider the helicity amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these amplitudes have no kinematical singularities or zeros @xcite . the relations between the amplitudes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the ones with isotopic spins @xmath0 and @xmath44 read f_c&=&(f^0 + f^2 ) , + f_n&=&(f^0 - f^2 )",
