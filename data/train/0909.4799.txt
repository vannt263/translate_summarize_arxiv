    "@xcite frequently accompany the description of the unusual electronic @xcite , thermal @xcite , and mechanical properties of graphene @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising _ graphene dreams _ is its application to a new generation of nanoelectronic devices @xcite . to that effect ,",
    "a number of systems have already been experimentally investigated , namely : single - electron transistors @xcite , quantum interference devices @xcite , and graphene dots @xcite .",
    "the presence of coulomb oscillations in graphene quantum dots was also identified by different groups @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the first investigations in this context focused on the transport properties of short ( and wide ) ribbons @xcite . for long graphene ribbons @xcite , it was shown that the low bias current flowing through the bulk of the ribbon is very robust with respect to a variety of constriction geometries and edge defects , a result also confirmed for disordered armchair nanoribbons @xcite . as in the case of short ribbons @xcite ,",
    "evanescent waves were seen to play an important role in the electronic transport through graphene quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the role of magnetic fields in the electronic levels of graphene quantum dots has been investigated by several authors .",
    "of particular interest for transport properties is the fact that optical properties can be tuned by the size and edge type of the dot @xcite",
    ". the shape and symmetry @xcite of the dots also play an important role on energy level statistics and charge density . for the special case of triangular quantum dots @xcite ,",
    "the existence of `` ghost states '' was revealed , when these dots have armchair edges , whereas for triangular dots with zigzag edges the well known surface states are present . of particular importance was the demonstration of large insensitivity of the electronic structure to the edge roughness @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for research in graphene quantum dots and ribbons is related to the need of producing a graphene - based system with an energy gap , which is not present in bulk graphene .",
    "this fact is a recognized shortcoming of bulk graphene , in what concerns applications relying on current electronic operation .",
    "gaps can be induced by electronic quantum confinement in narrow armchair ribbons @xcite , a result confirmed by _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , and experimentally @xcite .",
    "first principle calculations further show that zig - zag ribbons can support magnetic ground states which leads to a gapped spectrum @xcite .",
    "spin polarized ground states are also present in small graphene derivative molecular systems @xcite .",
    "this finding opens a new line of research : the study of spin polarized ground states of graphene quantum dots of different geometries . in both single @xcite and bilayer @xcite zig - zag ribbons",
    ", it was found that opposite edges align antiferromagnetically , with the magnetization rapidly decaying towards the bulk of the ribbon .",
    "hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations are specially suited for this type of study , since one can study the effect of different values of the coulomb interaction on the magnetic structure .",
    "an interesting effect emerges from such studies @xcite : graphene ribbons have no critical hubbard interaction , @xmath0 , and thus the hf ground state is always magnetic .",
    "this result is at odds with the behavior of bulk graphene @xcite and bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "this richness of different behaviors suggests studying the formation of magnetic ground states in graphene dots , a line a research we carry on in this paper from an hf point of view .",
    "interest in magnetism of sp@xmath1 carbon systems was greatly spurred by experiments with proton - irradiated graphite @xcite , and with the experimental evidence that the measured magnetism might stem from @xmath2-orbital physics alone @xcite .",
    "proton irradiation induces spatially disordered vacancies in the system @xcite .",
    "the magnetism found experimentally is supported theoretically by hartree - fock and _ ab - initio _ studies @xcite .",
    "recent experimental developments addressed the intrinsic ferromagnetism in hopg graphite , originating from the naturally occurring grain boundaries , where zig - zag edges develop and local magnetic moments are formed .",
    "typical hysteretical curves of a ferromagnetic material are seen in a temperature range from 5  k up to 300  k @xcite .",
    "hence , disorder , such as those line defects studied recently , is a possible route for ferromagnetism in carbon - based materials .",
    "however , disorder is not a necessary condition for magnetism in sp@xmath1 systems .",
    "it is by now well established theoretically that graphene systems with zig - zag edges can support magnetic moments and , in a system with perfect edges , this leads to magnetic ground states .",
    "an argument widely used against this result is based on the fact that the atoms at the edges are , essentially , gigantic free radicals , which would be impossible to realize in a true graphene system .",
    "this argument ignores , however , the fact that such _ gigantic free radicals _ can be chemically passivated with other chemical species , notably hydrogen .",
    "it is found _ ab - initio _ that the long range magnetic order is robust , even under passivation of the edges @xcite , confirming early predictions @xcite .    in small graphene structures ( triangles and hexagons )",
    ", magnetism has been thoroughly investigated @xcite both using _ ab - initio _ and hartree - fock methods , but generally for small dot sizes .",
    "the interplay between transport and magnetism has also been addressed @xcite , as well as magnetism induced by vacancies @xcite ( which can be seen as a three site zig - zag edge ) .",
    "another topic of experimental research that has recently seen a considerable upsurge , is the study of interplay between the mechanical properties of graphene and its electronic structure .",
    "the motivation for these studies is the possibility of tailoring the transport properties of graphene by means of externally induced strain @xcite .",
    "naturally related is the question of how can the above mentioned magnetic properties of graphene ribbons and dots be modified by external stress . in a previous work @xcite , some of the present authors showed that the electronic spectrum of graphene can be strongly modified by external stress .",
    "in particular , stress along the zig - zag edges of the system might eventually lead to the opening of a gap at large deformations .",
    "in addition to studying the magnetic properties of quantum dots in equilibrium , here we will also address how their magnetization is affected by external stress .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "the existence of magnetic ground states in graphene dots of nano to mesoscopic sizes depends on their geometry , and not only on the existence of zig - zag portions along their edges . within a hartree - fock framework",
    ", the existence ( or not ) of a minimum on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath3 , for the onset of magnetism depends critically on the dot geometry and symmetry .",
    "when strain is applied , the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals are naturally modified .",
    "this leads to a modification of the local magnetic moments found in the ground state , in a way which is much stronger than one would expect just by calculating the isotropic renormalization of the critical coulomb repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "our results show that magnetism is enhanced under uniaxial strain , and causes a reduction of @xmath3 , for the dots which exibith finite @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , we find that , under strain , the local magnetic moments associated with zig - zag edges in rectangular dots can drift from the zig - zag to the armchair edges .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "our study of magnetism in graphene quantum dots and antidots relies on the hubbard model with on - site interaction , an approach used by other authors in the study of graphene ribbons @xcite .",
    "since dots have no translation symmetry , the problem is solved in real space . to that end , we need to set up the hamiltonian in a matrix form , which requires a convenient algorithm to build such a matrix for the different type of dots . in what follows",
    "we describe the model , together with the physically relevant values of the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the study of magnetism in condensed matter physics is traditionally , and frequently , based upon the hubbard model , which can be written as @xmath4 for graphene the hopping integral is @xmath5 ev ( used as the energy unit in this work ) , @xmath0 is the on - site coulomb repulsion energy , and @xmath6 [ @xmath7 is the electronic creation operator at site @xmath8 [ site @xmath9 of the unit cell @xmath10 in the honeycomb lattice ( see fig . [",

    "the coulomb term is treated at the mean - field level @xcite by making the replacement of the quartic interaction by @xmath11 such that , when @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 . after this transformation ,",
    "the quantum problem becomes bi - linear in the electronic operators , and can be solved by diagonalization of two matrices of dimension @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total number of lattice sites in the dot .",
    "the electronic density has to be determined self - consistently and the mean - field equations read @xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mean electronic densities of spin @xmath19 at the @xmath8 and @xmath20 sites of the unit cell @xmath10 , respectively .",

    "we now discuss the importance of more general interactions @xcite .",
    "we first note that , at the mean - field level , a nearest neighbor coulomb interaction does not contribute to the existence of a ferromagnetic phase in the case of a system with translational invariance and a single orbital per unit cell @xcite .",
    "if in graphene we consider a coulomb term of the form @xmath41 it remains true that such interaction will not contribute ( at the hartree - fock level ) to the existence of a magnetic ground state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the situation is different , though , in a system without translational invariance , since the spin density in neighboring carbon atoms is not necessarily equal .",
    "this is of special relevance near the edges of the system .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian has the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 in eq .",

    "we shall assume that the leading overall effect of these three interactions can be captured by a renormalized hubbard interaction , @xmath0 , in the mean field calculations .",
    "thus the value of @xmath0 should reflect this effective interaction , rather than the bare on - site coulomb repulsion in graphene .",
    "we now proceed to study the ground state of dots and their magnetization as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "a natural question immediately arises : what value of effective @xmath0 should one take to be consistent with the magnitude of the real coulomb interactions in the material . for the benzene molecule @xmath0 was seen to be as large as 16  ev @xcite . in a recent study of magnetism in disordered graphene and irradiated graphite @xcite , the value of @xmath0 was considered to be in the interval 3 - 3.5 ev , based on the value accepted for _ trans-_polyacetylene , a one - dimensional bipartite sp@xmath1 carbon system ( although this value of @xmath0 for _ trans-_polyacetylene has been subject to controversy @xcite ) .",
    "other two recent studies @xcite took @xmath562 ev and @xmath57 ev , values that reproduce the lda gap in graphene ribbons @xcite and the homo - lumo gap in small graphene based structures .",

    "this choice is justified because there are almost no visible finite - size effects , as we explicitly show below by studying dots of different sizes .",

    "in this paper we have studied magnetism in graphene quantum dots of particular geometries , with and without zig - zag edges .",
    "similarly to what has been proposed in the context of graphene nanoribbons , the magnetism displayed by these systems may be used in spin filters .",
    "we have not studied the effect of leads on the ferromagnetic order , but the broadening of the quantum dot levels due to coupling to the leads ( a system with a continuous spectrum ) , will have an impact on the magnetic properties of the dot . in the case of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle ,",
    "a theoretical description has already been developed @xcite , but no such model exists for graphene to our best knowledge .",
    "this study will be the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
    "another aspect we have not considered in our study is the effect of the substrate on the magnetic properties of the dot .",
    "since graphene dots are meant to be used as nanoelectronic devices , they will always interact with some substrate , which can reduce thermal fluctuations , and favor magnetism at finite temperatures .",
    "it is worth stressing again the main reason for magnetism at the edges of some graphene systems .",
    "thinking about graphene ribbons or dots as a bulk system , that is by looking at the total density of states , leads immediately to the objection that magnetism should not be present for any finite @xmath0 value .",
    "however , by looking at our results for magnetism in these systems it is clear that this is a property of the edges .",
    "therefore the relevant quantity is not the bulk density of states , but rather the local density of states , and this latter quantity , near the edges , does become very large at the fermi energy ( @xmath82 ) , thus leading to very small critical @xmath0 values ( eventually indistinguishable from zero ) .",
    "this shows that the total density of states is not a relevant quantity for this problem .",
    "_ ab - initio _ calculations have shown that very small benzene - based systems , such as bisanthrene , have ferromagnetic ground states , and therefore we expect that magnetism will also be present in small quantum dots of graphene , as hinted by our hartree - fock results .",
    "we have also seen how stress might affect the magnetic ground states . when applied along the zig - zag edges",
    ", stress seems to promote a spatial rearrangement the magnetization distribution throughout the dot .",
    "this , combined with the transport response of these systems , may allow mechanical control over spin - polarized currents flowing inside the dot .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that stress along zig - zag edges leads to the formation of dimers weakly coupled between them , suggests that the system may prefer to form a sort of spin liquid .",
    "investigations of whether the ground state will be truly magnetic or a spin liquid are required .    in our calculations including strain , we have resorted to linear elasticity to describe the lattice deformations , as reported in reference .",
    "we now wish to justify its validity , since it is an important point an deserves a careful explanation .",
    "we do not expect linear theory to remain valid for deformations as high as the 20% used in some of our calculations above .",
    "however , since we are interested solely in the influence of strain in the electronic structure , and not on the detailed elastic response , the relevant detail is not the validity of the linear theory itself , but rather how a certain amount of strain changes the hoping values . in our calculations we combined linear theory with the widespread parameterization of the dependence of the @xmath138 on the carbon - carbon distance @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the length of the stretched ( or compressed ) carbon - carbon distance , in units of that undeformed distance",
    "from the above equation what matters really is the quantity @xmath141 , which is determined by the amount of strain , and its prefactor in the argument of the exponential .",
    "since there might be legitimate doubts with respect to the use of linear elasticity for determining @xmath140 in the above equation , this issue was addressed in another publication @xcite . there , first principles calculations were used to study the effect of strain on the nearest - neighbor hopping values . by their nature , first principles calculations make no use of any elastic approximation , being valid for arbitrary deformations , in principle .",
    "it was found that the combined use of linear theory and of the above formula for @xmath138 gives accurate results for the hoping values .",
    "moreover , as discussed in reference subsequent _ ab - initio _ calculations have shown good quantitative agreement with the use of linear elasticity combined with the parameterization ( for example the merging of the two dirac points for tension along the zigzag direction is predicted to occur at the same values of strain , around 25% , both _",
    "ab - initio _ and within tight - binding with linear elasticity ) .",
    "therefore our approach to the calculation of the hopping variation upon strain , and its consequences for the @xmath2-bandstructure is accurately captured by the linear theory .",
    "the impact of edge roughness on the magnetic properties of the dots also deserves some considerations . in graphene nanostructures",
    "prepared with current fabrication techniques , the edges are invariably rough and disordered .",
    "this can hinder the stability of long range magnetic order . however much is still unknown with respect to the nature of edge reconstruction in real graphene nanostructures .",
    "it is expected that the chemical bonds at the edges be under ( surface ) tension , which leads to edge reconstruction as a means of relieving elastic energy .",
    "this reconstruction could lead to self - organization of the edge , reducing the roughness and allowing for long range magnetic order .",
    "moreover , the recent advances in tailoring , at the atomic level , sub - nanostructures by transmission electron microscope @xcite , might allow unprecedented control over the edge profiles .",
    "having such control will certainly add greater tangibility to the prospect of tailoring magnetic states in graphene nanostructures .    finally , we point out that the experimental observation of ferromagnetism arising from grain boundaries with zig - zag edges in graphite strongly suggests that dimensionality is not a paramount issue in carbon - based systems , as long as some mechanism for quenching the thermal and quantum fluctuations is present .",
    "besides the anisotropy in the interaction between the local magnetic moments @xcite , the fact that graphene is generally deposited onto a substrate could provide an extra quenching mechanism , in the same way that it suppresses the fluctuation - induced crumpling of the two - dimensional graphene membrane .",
