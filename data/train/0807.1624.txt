    "<S> a significant fraction of @xmath0 collisions at the lhc will involve ( quasi - real ) photon interactions occurring at energies well beyond the electroweak energy scale . hence , the lhc can to some extend be considered as a high - energy photon - photon or photon - proton collider . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a unique possibility for novel and complementary research where the available effective luminosity is small , relative to parton - parton interactions , but it is compensated by better known initial conditions and usually simpler final states . </S>",
    "<S> this is in a way a method for approaching some of the issues to be addressed by the future lepton collider . </S>",
    "<S> such studies of photon interactions are possible at the lhc , thanks to the striking experimental signatures of events involving photon exchanges , in particular the presence of very forward scattered protons .    </S>",
    "<S> photon - induced processes , and in particular the two - photon production , have not been so far a subject of intense research at proton colliders . in 1973 the measurement of two - photon exclusive production of lepton pairs , @xmath1 , at the cern intersecting storage ring was proposed as means of a precise , absolute luminosity measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it did not materialize then , since at the isr energies it required detection of leptons at very small transverse momenta to obtain significant event statistics . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , first such events have been observed at much higher energies , in @xmath2 collisions at tevatron @xcite and in ion - ion collisions at rhic  @xcite , with a little background and very striking signature  only two opposite charge tracks , identified as muons or electrons , without any other activity in the central detectors . </S>",
    "<S> two tracks are back - to - back to an unusual degree , and have very little total transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> these two features are very characteristic of the two - photon production , due to the very small photon virtualities involved . on the one hand , it results in very forward scattering of incident protons , almost at zero - degree angle , on the other hand the dilepton system is produced by almost exact head - on collisions of quasi - real photons . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the dilepton exclusive production in @xmath0 collisions has been proposed to measure absolute lhc luminosity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been discussed also in the context of ion collisions at the lhc @xcite , as well as of new dedicated detectors capable to measure leptons at small transverse momenta @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> corrections due to the strong interactions have been studied in detail and were found to be negligible , therefore the qed calculation of the cross section should give sufficient accuracy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these features make this process a perfect calibration candle for the two - photon processes at the lhc , and the cdf measurement can be regarded as a proof - of - principle experiment for photon physics at hadron colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> when the invariant mass of the system @xmath3 produced in the two photon process , @xmath4 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , is not too small , one can factorize the amplitudes for the two photon exchanges and for the photon interaction , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for introducing equivalent photon fluxes , which play similar role to the parton density functions for the hadron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this is the basis of the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) , which allows the calculation of the proton cross - section as a product of the photon cross - section and two equivalent photon fluxes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the huge center - of - mass energy at the lhc , @xmath6  tev the photon fluxes are significant at large energies , well above 100  gev , and drop with energy approximately like @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fraction of the incident proton energy carried by the exchanged photon .    , at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> two incoming protons are scattered quasi - elastically at very small angles , and the produced system @xmath3 can be detected in the central detectors . ]    in elastic proton scattering , when the proton survives the photon exchange , the virtuality @xmath9 of the exchanged photon is limited from below by a kinematical limit , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the proton mass . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal photon virtuality is then due to the presence of the proton electromagnetic form factor , and of the finite spatial distribution of the proton charge , which cuts off completely the equivalent photon flux above @xmath12  gev@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the photon flux drops with virtuality approximately like @xmath14 , therefore for small @xmath15 the photon virtuality is on average very small , and one can usually treat these sub - processes as due to quasi - real photon collisions </S>",
    "<S> . this might be not true for inelastic production when at least one of the two incident protons dissociates into a low mass state . </S>",
    "<S> both minimal and maximal photon virtualities are much higher than for the elastic case at the same energy .    the photon - photon center - of - mass energy @xmath16 is approximately given by @xmath17 , and assuming the epa one can introduce the two - photon luminosity spectrum in @xmath16 , defined as a convolution of the two photon fluxes ( integrated over @xmath9 ) for fixed @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> such a luminosity spectrum drops approximately like @xmath18 , and its inelastic part is about two times bigger than the elastic one @xcite . by integrating the luminosity spectrum above some minimal center - of - mass energy </S>",
    "<S> , one can introduce the relative photon - photon luminosity @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> effectively , @xmath19 gives a fraction of the proton - proton luminosity which is available for @xmath20 collisions , and is especially useful if a given photon - photon cross - section is approximately constant as a function of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the elastic relative photon - photon luminosity at the lhc is equal to 1% for @xmath21  gev ( i.e. for @xmath22  gev ) , and 0.1% for @xmath23  gev @xcite . given the very large lhc luminosity , this leads to significant event rates of high - energy processes with relatively small photon - photon cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> this is even more true for the photon - proton interactions at the lhc , where both energy reach and effective luminosities are much higher than for the photon - photon case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high luminosity and the high c.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> energy of photoproduction processes offer interesting possibilities for the study of electroweak interaction and for searches beyond the standard model ( sm ) up to tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can extend studies at hera of the single w boson photoproduction , or of the searches of anomalous flavor changing neutral current top quark couplings , to much higher energies @xcite , effectively converting the lhc into a super - hera collider for this class of processes . </S>",
    "<S> some of the photoproduction cross - section are so large that become a significant part of the total inclusive cross - section at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the associated photoproduction of wh is about 5% of the total inclusive cross - section for @xmath24 at the lhc @xcite !    ) at the lhc @xcite ; @xmath25 is the invariant mass of the centrally produced system @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> other curves show the corresponding spectra for the inclusive diffraction . ]    </S>",
    "<S> one needs however to consider corrections beyond the epa due to a possibility of strong interactions between protons , or the so - called rescattering effects . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting suppression , or the non 100% probability of proton survival , of the cross sections weakly depends on the invariant mass of the exclusively produced state @xmath3 . for the production of pairs of massive particles , as @xmath26 , the proton survival probability is estimated to be about 85% @xcite . in photoproduction , the proton survival probability is still high , though in general is slightly lower than in the photon - photon case . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is about 70% for the single w boson photoproduction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the measurements of photon - induced processes were proposed for verification of the models describing such soft , non - perturbative strong interactions , which occur at large impact parameter in @xmath0 collisions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one should discuss the potentially dangerous background due to the central exclusive diffraction ( ced ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , the elastic photon - photon luminosity is compared to the luminosity of the ced , both including the proton survival probability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the proton survival probability is in general much smaller in diffraction due to smaller impact parameters involved , or in other words due to smaller range of gluon exchanges with respect to the photon ones . </S>",
    "<S> plots in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 show that for the invariant masses of the produced system above 200 gev the @xmath20 luminosity takes over , so the systems exclusively produced at the lhc and of the largest invariant mass are due to photon - induced interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it means also that the ced is heavily suppressed for production of massive non strongly - interacting particles and can be safely neglected . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the gluon mediated exclusive production of w boson pairs , is about 100 times smaller than the two - photon production at the lhc @xcite .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , the exclusive two - photon production , @xmath4 , provides clean experimental conditions , and well defined final states can be then selected , and precisely reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , detection of the final state protons , scattered at almost zero - degree angle , in the dedicated very forward detectors ( vfds ) , provides another striking signature , effective also at high luminosity and with large event pile - up @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a set of vfds at 220  m or 420  m from the lhc interaction points will be capable of tagging photon interactions within the wide photon energy range of @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the photon energies can be then well measured with 15% relative resolution and used for the event kinematics reconstruction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse momenta of the scattered protons , or equivalently the photon virtualities , are more difficult to measure , but providing the high resolution vfds and precise detector alignment the absolute @xmath28 resolution of about 0.3  gev / c could be achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this then allows for some additional control of the diffractive background , which in general results in proton scattering at larger @xmath28 @xcite . as was mentioned , the photon tagging allow to suppress very effectively , the inclusive backgrounds , in particular it is true for double tagging of the exclusive two - photon processes , which is equivalent to a triple coincidence  the detection in the same beam crossing of the system @xmath3 in the central detectors and of two protons scattered in opposite directions </S>",
    "<S> this technique should be effective even at the highest lhc luminosity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , special picosecond resolution time - of - flight detectors are proposed to provide yet another , direct control and suppression of the backgrounds due to accidental coincidences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on measuring the longitudinal position of event vertex using the _ z - by - timing _ technique , and comparing it with the event vertex z - position as determined by the central detectors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , measurements of the forward proton scattering angles provide offers also a unique possibility for determination of the cp parity of the produced system @xmath3 by measuring the azimuthal asymmetry of the outgoing protons , especially interesting in case of observation of new states , beyond the sm @xcite .    in the center of interest in the high energy two - photon interactions at </S>",
    "<S> the lhc lies , very naturally , the exclusive production of non strongly - interacting pairs of charged particles . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed as a possible , novel and original way of detecting supersymmetric charginos , sleptons and the charged higgs bosons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but is is also an excellent test - ground for the sm , in particular in the case of the two - photon w boson pair production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> detection of new , massive and quasi - stable charged particles , as predicted in some variants of supersymmetry @xcite , is very unambiguos in two - photon exclusive production , allowing for clear interpretation . assuming the possibility of measuring such events at the highest luminosity and negligible backgrounds </S>",
    "<S> , this type of search for new states could reach sensitivity to very interesting masses up to 250300  gev .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , photon physics can be studied also in ion collisions at the lhc , where the lower ion luminosities are largely compensated by the high photon fluxes due to the @xmath29 enhancement ( for each nucleus ) , where @xmath30 is the ion charge . for example , the two - photon exclusive production of the sm higgs boson in ion collisions was considered as a discovery channel for a very light @xmath31 @xcite . however , for the mass of the exclusively produced system above 100  gev , the coherent enhancement is not effective  the exchanged photons prefer to couple to protons in an ion rather than to the total ion charge @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that at the not too high energy , where the strong electromagnetic enhancement is still effective one can profit from an improved significantly signal - to - background ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for studies of wide range of processes and new phenomena , involving in particular high parton density , nuclear and strong field effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth adding , that in ion collisions , though in more limited range , the proton ( and/or neutron ) forward tagging technique can also be applied at the lhc .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the photon - induced processes offer a rich and exciting field of research at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> it shoud provide complementary and interesting results for tests of the standard model as well as for search of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> one can not afford to miss it  on the contrary , dedicated forward detectors should be installed if one wants to get out the best of the lhc . </S>"
