    "empirically the literature reports several behaviors for the income and wealth distributions in different countries .",
    "a century ago , the italian social economist pareto suggested a power - law  @xcite distribution in the high - income range , namely , in terms of cumulative distribution : @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the pareto index  @xcite . on the other hand montroll",
    "@xcite suggested a lognormal distribution with power law tail for the usa personal income .",
    "more recently , wealth and income distributions in the usa and in the united kingdom have been described by an exponential distribution with power law high - end tails  @xcite . whereas , the japanese personal income distribution appears to follow lognormal distributions also with power law tails  @xcite . in some recent papers zipfs law",
    "has also been proposed  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we add to the above empirical investigations an analysis of the income distribution in australia ( figure  [ f.income ] ) .",
    "> from the theoretical side , it has been shown that pure multiplicative stochastic ( msp ) processes can explain the lognormal income distribution but they fail to explain the power law tails  @xcite .",
    "power law tails can be obtained extending msp processes by including -for instance- additive noise and boundary constraints  @xcite .",
    "these models explain well the emergence of power law distributions , but they are incomplete , neglecting interactions between agents . hence , msps with interacting agents connected through a network have been developed  @xcite .",
    "these models retrieve power law tails with exponents @xmath1 which are related to the network properties .    in this paper",
    ", we show that distributions with power law tails can emerge also from additive stochastic processes with interacting agents . in this case , we show that the network of connections among agents plays a crucial role .",
    "indeed , the resulting wealth distribution is shaped directly by the degree distribution of the network .",
    "the original purpose of the present work was not to construct any realistic model for the wealth distribution .",
    "our aim was simply to demonstrate the possibility to obtain ` fat ' tails also without the use of multiplicative stochastic processes .",
    "rather surprising we find out that the results from such an additive process are in good qualitative agreement with the empirical data for the income distribution in australia .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown that a mechanism of wealth exchange with additive gaussian noise can produce distributions with power - law tails when the network which connects the agents is of a scale - free type . although the original purpose of this work was not to produce a realistic model for the wealth evolution",
    ", we find a good qualitative agreement between the empirical data and the theoretical prediction .",
    "more realistic models will be proposed in future works by introducing also multiplicative stochastic terms and a dynamical evolution in the network connectivity .",
