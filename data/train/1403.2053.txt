    "it has been established that the higgs boson has been found at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the measured properties of the higgs boson are best described by the standard - model ( sm ) higgs boson @xcite , which was proposed in 1960s @xcite .",
    "the study @xcite showed that the gauge - higgs coupling @xmath4 is very close to the sm value , but the top- and bottom - yukawa couplings can not be determined as precise as @xmath5 by the current data . in particular , since the higgs boson can not decay into a top - quark pair , the top - yukawa coupling can only be determined as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) in the fit that allows ( disallows ) additional loop contributions to @xmath8 and @xmath9 couplings . and @xmath9 couplings are allowed , the top - yukawa coupling is only loosely bounded due to a very small contribution of associated higgs production with a @xmath10 pair to the current higgs data . ]",
    "this is easy to understand because the top - yukawa coupling only appears in the loops of @xmath8 and @xmath11 in the gluon fusion process , and also because the top contribution is much smaller than the @xmath12-loop contribution in the @xmath8 coupling .",
    "some other methods to determine the top - yukawa are desired .    in literature ,",
    "the most studied process of probing the top - yukawa is associated higgs production with a top - quark pair @xmath13 , which can directly determine the absolute value of the top - yukawa coupling .",
    "however , the sign can not be determined in this process . on the other hand ,",
    "associated higgs production with a single top quark has the potential of measuring the sign of the top - yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "just take an example of one of the processes that contribute to a single top quark and a higgs boson in the final state , @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "diagram ( a ) is proportional to the gauge - higgs coupling and the diagram ( b ) is proportional to the top - yukawa coupling .",
    "there is another diagram with the higgs boson attached to the bottom - quark leg but is very small proportional to the bottom - yukawa coupling .",
    "the interference between the top - yukawa diagram and the gauge - higgs diagram was shown to be significant and induces large variations in the total cross section with the size and the relative sign of the higgs couplings to the gauge boson and the top quark . therefore ,",
    "if in the future the production cross section of a single top quark and a higgs boson can be measured with sufficient accuracy , one can determine the size and the relative sign of the top - yukawa coupling .",
    "in this work , we study associated higgs production with a single top quark and the potential of measuring the size and the sign of top - yukawa in the presence of backgrounds , with full detector simulations .",
    "this is the main objective of this work .",
    "in addition to the above process , there are other processes that a single top quark and a higgs boson can appear in the final state : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "since additional or different particles appear in the final state , all these processes can be specifically identified , although the first process @xmath14 has the largest cross section .    in this work ,",

    "perhaps , one can look into the substructure in the fast - moving @xmath172 jet .",
    "if one can achieve better efficiencies , it will enhance the probe of the single top associated higgs production",
    "the @xmath146 has a very small branching ratio , and so the detection of single top associated higgs production requires an extremely high luminosity .",
    "one should pursue the @xmath174 mode , which has about one order of magnitude larger in event rates , but different backgrounds . 7 .",
    "we do not attempt the @xmath29 mode in this work , simply because the higgs boson peak can not be reconstructed in this mode , unless we go for the @xmath175 mode .",
    "if the top - yukawa is close to the sm value , the best chance to observe associated higgs production with a single top quark is via the @xmath162 channel . however , it requires an integrated luminosity more than 1000 fb@xmath155 .    in summary , we have studied the effects of varying the top - yukawa coupling in the higgs associated production with a single top quark , with full detector simulations , we found that the @xmath2 mode with the semileptonic decay of the top quark has the highest potential in observing the process and the effects of top - yukawa coupling , especially the sign of the top - yukawa coupling can be determined .",

    "<S> associated production of the higgs boson with a single top quark proceeds through feynman diagrams , which are either proportional to the @xmath0 , top - yukawa , or the bottom - yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in literature that the interference between the top - yukawa and the gauge - higgs diagrams can be significant , and thus the measurement of the cross sections can help pin down the sign and the size of the top - yukawa coupling . here </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed study with full detector simulations of such a possibility at the lhc-14 within the current allowed range of @xmath0 and top - yukawa couplings , using @xmath1 modes . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the lhc-14 has the potential to distinguish the size and the sign of the top - yukawa coupling . among the channels the @xmath2 mode provides the best chance to probe the signal , followed by the @xmath3 mode , which has the advantage of a narrow reconstructed mass peak . </S>",
    "<S> we also pointed out that the spatial separation among the final - state particles has the potential in differentiating among various values of the top - yukawa coupling .    </S>",
