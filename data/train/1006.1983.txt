    "one of the reasons spinel oxides ab@xmath9o@xmath10 have been of interest is the various spin structures they show at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite cubic spinels _",
    "_ m__cr@xmath0o@xmath1 ( _ _ m__=mn , co ) have drawn much attention recently in relation with multiferroics since it was found that their spin configuration leads ferroelectric .",
    "@xcite the magnetic phase of _ _ m__cr@xmath0o@xmath1 changes from paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic and from ferrimagnetic to spiral orders as the temperature decreases , even becoming glass - like at low temperatures .",
    "the complexity in the spin structure of cubic spinels results from geometrical frustration among the spins of b site ions , which form the lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "_ m _ ( cr ) ions occupy the a ( b ) sites that locate at the center of a tetrahedron ( octahedron ) in the oxygen lattice .",
    "both the _ m _ ions and cr ions are magnetic , and their magnetization directions are opposed in the ordered states .    the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath11 among the spins of the b site ions does not induce ordered states due to the aforementioned frustration .",
    "@xcite however , the addition of the exchange interaction @xmath12 between the a and b site ions can give rise to a magnetic order . the relative strength of @xmath12 to @xmath11",
    "is the key factor determining the state of the magnetic order , including the spin canting angle .",
    "the nel configuration , a collinear ferrimagnet , is expected to be the ground state when @xmath11 is much weaker than @xmath12 . as @xmath11 increases , both the _ m _ and cr spins become canted and the magnetic structure becomes complex .",
    "a classical theory predicts that the ground state of a cubic spinel is determined by the parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the spin magnitudes at the a and b sites , respectively .",
    "@xcite the nel configuration is the ground state when @xmath16 and the ferrimagnetic spiral is locally stable when @xmath17 .",
    "it becomes unstable when @xmath18 .",
    "an early neutron diffraction experiment showed that the ferrimagnetic spiral is the ground spin state of the cubic spinel mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite two different spin canting angle values were measured for the cr ions , while only one value was measured for the mn ions .",
    "the cone angles of the mn ions , cr(i ) , and cr(ii ) in the ferrimagnetic spiral were @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the approximate @xmath22 value estimated by these measurements is 1.6 , which predicts that the ferrimagnetic spiral is unstable .",
    "in contrast , the cone angle of mn ion spins measured by nmr was @xmath23 or @xmath24 , while those of cr(i ) and cr(ii ) spins were @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "@xcite theory poorly matches these numbers , but it predicts a very unstable spiral state in general .",
    "the question as to whether the ferrimagnetic spiral is the stable ground state in the cubic spinels was raised again by a recent neutron diffraction experiment involving @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite it was reported that the ferrimagnetic state is long - range ordered for all temperatures below @xmath28 k , and that the spiral component appears in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the ferrimagnetic order below @xmath29 k. however , it is only short - range ordered .",
    "the present study investigates the characteristics of the ordered spin state of @xmath30 at a low temperature by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "first , the cone angles of mn and cr ion spins , to which the previous nmr and neutron diffraction results gave different values , were measured .",
    "information pertaining to accurate cone angles is important to understand not only the ground state of the spin order but also the electrical polarization .",
    "@xcite we measured the nuclear spin - spin relaxation time @xmath31 as a function of the temperature to study the change in the spin fluctuation with temperature .",
    "the result indicates that the fluctuation of the spiral component increases rapidly as the temperature approaches the phase transition temperature of the spiral order @xmath32 , above which the fluctuation is too fast for the spiral component to be measured by even local probes such as neutron diffraction or nmr .",
    "the temperature - dependence of the nmr signal intensity reveals that the spiral phase is mixed with the ferrimagnetic phase at temperatures below @xmath32 .",
    "a polycrystalline mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 sample was synthesized by a solid - state reaction from a molar ratio mixture of mno and cr@xmath0o@xmath33 powders .",
    "the mixture was sintered at @xmath34c for 12 hours in an ar environment , for 12 additional hours at @xmath35c , and finally for 24 hours at @xmath36c .",
    "a single - crystalline sample was grown by the flux method using a mixture of mnco@xmath33 , cr@xmath0o@xmath33 , pbf@xmath0 and pbo ( molar ratio = 1:1:2:2 ) .",
    "nmr signals were obtained by the conventional spin echo method using a custom - made spectrometer in the temperature range of 4 to 20 k. to estimate the spin canting angle , the resonance frequency was measured for various magnetic fields up to 4 t. the nuclear spin - spin relaxation time , @xmath31 , was obtained by varying the time delay between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 pulses .",
    "the @xmath39cr nmr spectrum was measured in the frequency range from 60 to 70 mhz , and the @xmath40mn nmr spectrum was assessed from 530 to 560 mhz . as the spectral width was very broad , the signal intensity was measured as a function of the frequency after selective excitation .",
    "the magnetization versus the temperature curves show a discrepancy in the transition temperatures of the ferrimagnetic spiral and the collinear ferrimagnet of the polycrystalline and single - crystalline samples . in fig .",
    "[ magnetizationcurve ] , the thick solid and dashed lines represent the field cooling ( fc ) and zero field cooling ( zfc ) m(t ) curves of the polycrystalline sample , respectively , and the thin solid and dotted lines represent those of the single crystal .",
    "@xmath41 is relatively well defined by the abrupt increase in the magnetization in both samples of approximately 40 k for the polycrystalline sample and 50 k for the single - crystalline sample .",
    "@xmath32 of the polycrystalline sample is more clearly defined by the abrupt decrease in the magnetization at 20 k compared to that of the single - crystalline sample , whose magnetization decreases smoothly at approximately 12 k only in the zfc case .",
    "the m(t ) curves of our polycrystalline and single - crystalline samples are in good agreement with those in previous reports .",
    "@xcite one of the reasons for the difference in the characteristics of the two samples is the site disorder in the single - crystalline sample .",
    "x - ray absorption spectroscopy showed that the mn ions occupy only the a sites and the cr ions occupy the b sites in our polycrystalline sample , whereas both ions are found in both sites in the single - crystalline sample .",
    "@xcite all of the experimental data described below were obtained from the polycrystalline sample .",
    "figure  [ zerofield ] shows the @xmath39cr nmr spectrum obtained in a zero field at 6.5 k for several different echo times .",
    "the spectrum obtained at the echo time of @xmath42 shows a very well - defined single peak whose width is about 5 mhz .",
    "the single peak centered around 67 mhz at a short echo time of @xmath42 appears to split into a double peak as the echo time supasses @xmath43 .",
    "this is not a splitting but a suppression of the spectral intensity around the center due to the frequency - dependent nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate . in an ordered magnetic insulator containing a high concentration of identical magnetic nuclear spins , the suhl - nakmura ( sn ) interaction , in which nuclear spins are indirectly coupled by virtual magnons ,",
    "is expected to play a major role in the nmr relaxation at low temperatures .",
    "it is known that the sn interaction generates a field- and frequency - dependent @xmath31 with a minimum occurring in the center of the spectrum , as the majority of nuclear spins precess at this frequency .",
    "@xcite the double peak feature of the spectrum obtained at @xmath43 disappears in the spectrum obtained at the same echo time , however , in a magnetic field , as denoted by the open circles in the figure .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the spin - spin relaxation rate due to the sn interaction decreases as the field increases .",
    "the dependence of @xmath31 on the frequency and field confirms that the sn interaction is the main source of cr nuclear interaction in mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this most likely explains why a double peak was observed in the previous nmr work , rather than the difference in the sample quality .",
    "@xcite the difference of only 3 @xmath44 in the canting angles of the two cr spins associated with the two peaks in the previous nmr report supports this claim , because the experimental error of the canting angle as estimated by nmr is larger than this in general .",
    "the @xmath40mn nmr spectrum showed a well - defined single peak centered around 550 mhz in a zero field at the liquid - helium temperature .",
    "the spin canting angles of the mn@xmath45 and cr@xmath46 ions relative to the magnetization direction are determined by the shift of the spectrum with an external field .",
    "the nmr resonance frequency @xmath47 is proportional to the magnitude of the total field , which is the vector sum of the hyperfine field @xmath48 and external field @xmath49 .",
    "this is expressed as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath52 is the angle between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the direction of the hyperfine field is antiparallel to the local magnetization in most magnetic materials , providing the minus sign in the equation .",
    "as the hyperfine fields of the mn@xmath45 and cr@xmath46 ions in mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 are more than one order of magnitude larger than the external magnetic field used in the experiment , the first - order approximation of the total field can be taken .",
    "the slope of the frequency shift with external field is then determined as @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "[ coneangle ] , the center frequencies of the cr and mn nmr spectra obtained at 4.2 k are plotted as a function of the external field . both of the frequencies change linearly in the experimental field range , as expected .",
    "the resonance frequency of the mn spectrum decreases as the field increases , whereas that of the cr spectrum increases .",
    "this visually shows that the spin directions of the mn and cr ions are opposite to each other , because the signs of the hyperfine fields of the ions are identical . from the slope of the linear fit to the data ,",
    "the spin canting angles of the mn and cr ions were determined to be @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "this is contrary to the previous neutron diffraction or nmr experiments that reported two different values of spin canting angles for cr ions .",
    "the canting angle of the mn spin is identical to that in one of the previous nmr reports  @xcite but twice as large as the value of the neutron result  @xcite .",
    "the canting angle of the cr spin is consistent with the previous nmr measurement  @xcite and one of the values given by the neutron diffraction  @xcite . considering that no single value of @xmath22 can result in these cone angles",
    ", the classical theory fails to explain the result .",
    "however , both of the values corresponding to the mn and cr spin canting angles indicate that the ferrimagnetic spiral configuration is unstable in mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this reminds us of the fact that a long range order of the ferrimagnetic component accompanies a short range order of the spiral component below @xmath7 in mncr@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite    figure  [ t2 ] shows the nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath6 of cr ions at temperatures ranging from 6.5 k to 14.5 k. the relaxation rate increases relatively slowly with the temperature below 11 k , above which the slope becomes steep .",
    "the main interaction a cr ion nucleus experiences is the interaction with the electron spins of magnetic ions and the prominent relaxation source is sn interaction that is mediated by spin wave as mentioned above .",
    "the relaxation due to sn interaction is normally temperature independent .",
    "therefore , the weakly temperature dependent relaxation with the rate of @xmath56 near 7 k should be mainly due to sn interaction .",
    "the additional relaxation increasing with temperature indicates that the spin fluctuation becomes too large to be described in the framework of spin waves as the temperature approaches @xmath7 .",
    "the previous observation that the spiral component of the spin order is unstable and short ordered implies that it is the spiral component of the cr ion spins that fluctuates .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the saturation magnetization plotted together with the nuclear relaxation rate in fig .",
    "the value of the saturation magnetization stays at @xmath57 independent of temperature even when the temperature crosses @xmath7 , where the spiral component is generated or vanishes .",
    "this means that the component along the easy axis remains the same while the spiral component perpendicular to it is averaged out by fluctuation crossing @xmath7 , leaving only the ferrimagnetic order .",
    "the nmr signal intensity is in general a function of the temperature , @xmath31 , and the number of nuclei .",
    "the data points in fig .",
    "[ domain ] , where the cr nmr signal intensity vs. the temperature is plotted , were obtained from the raw experimental data after temperature and @xmath31 correction .",
    "thus , they represent the number of the nuclei producing the signal .",
    "the signal intensity obtained while warming the sample stays constant while that obtained while cooling it changes .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the nmr signal is observed not in the ferrimagnetic phase but only in the spiral phase of mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the corrected signal intensity in the figure is proportional to the volume of the ferrimagnetic spiral phase . upon warming ,",
    "the entire volume of the mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 sample maintains its ferrimagnetic spiral phase until the change to the ferrimagnetic phase at @xmath7 . upon cooling , however , mncr@xmath0o@xmath1 remains in the ferrimagnetic phase well below @xmath7 . in the temperature region where the signal intensity changes , the two phases coexist .",
    "depending on the temperature change history , the ferrimagnetic spiral phase is embedded in the matrix of the collinear ferrimagnet phase .",
    "this mixed phase might have caused some error in the measurement of various quantities in the previous neutron diffraction and nmr experiments .",
    "the temperature hysteresis in the volume of the ferrimagnetic spiral phase can be ascribed to a first - order transition at @xmath7 .",
    "an esr work on the similar cubic spinel cocr@xmath9o@xmath10 showed an abrupt shift of the frequency at @xmath32 , also indicating a first - order transition .",
    "@xcite the experimental evidence is in conflict to the second - order transition on which the classical theory is based .",
    "the mn nmr signal intensity also showed a similar temperature hysteresis .",
    "the spin canting angles of mn and cr ions and the nuclear spin - spin relaxation rates were measured in this study .",
    "only one canting angle of cr spins was observed , contrary to that observed in previous neutron and nmr experiments .",
    "the measured canting angles predict an unstable ferrimagnetic spiral state at a low temperature .",
    "this instability is consistent with the measurement of the spin - spin relaxation rate .",
    "the relaxation rate increases more rapidly as the temperature increases until it appears to diverge at @xmath7 .",
    "the rapid increase in the relaxation rate near @xmath7 can be explained by the fluctuation of the spiral component . the nmr signal is not observed due to this strong relaxation near @xmath7 .",
    "the nmr signal is unobservable above @xmath7 as well , where the magnetic phase is collinear ferrimagnetic .",
    "the magnetization remains the same , crossing @xmath7 , indicating that the canted spins in the ferrimagnetic spiral phase do not line up along one direction , entering the ferrimagnetic phase ; instead , the fluctuation of the spiral component averages out to leave only the magnetic component along the easy axis .",
    "the fluctuation accelerates as the temperature approaches @xmath7 , and past @xmath7 , it becomes fast enough to make the spiral component unobservable in neutron diffraction experiments but not fast enough to leave an averaged hyperfine field to nuclei in the time scale of nuclear spin precession , which is on the order of @xmath8 s. the temperature hysteresis of the spiral volume fraction indicates that the spiral and collinear ferrimagnetic phases are generally mixed below @xmath7 ."
