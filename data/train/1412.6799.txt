    "the counter - intuitive electrostatic effects produced by mobile multivalent counterions in the vicinity of charged macromolecular surfaces ( such as biopolymers like dna , membranes , colloids , nano - particles and virus - like nano - capsids ) have been studied extensively within the counterion - only models and in the case of non - disordered , homogeneous surface charge distributions ( see , e.g. , recent reviews in refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these effects include , most notably , the so - called like - charge attraction induced by multivalent counterions between charged surfaces of the same sign .",
    "the like - charge attraction phenomena stand at odds with the _ weak coupling _",
    "( wc ) paradigm based traditionally on the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory @xcite and requires the framework of the _ strong coupling _ ( sc ) theories @xcite that incorporate strong ion - surface correlations , to the leading order , and ion - ion correlations , to subleading orders , ubiquitous in the situation where electrostatic interactions are strong ; this is realized at low temperatures , solvents with low dielectric constant , and/or with highly charged macromolecular surfaces but , most prominently , with multivalent counterions . usually , however , charged bio - soft systems with multivalent counterions include also a finite amount of monovalent salt ions that couple weakly to charged surfaces .",
    "a few experimental examples of such systems are furnished by the condensation of dna by multivalent cations in the bulk @xcite or in viruses and virus - like nano - capsids @xcite , and formation of large aggregates ( or bundles ) of highly charged biopolymers such as dna @xcite , f - actin @xcite and microtubules @xcite . in these situations , one deals with a difficult problem in which neither the wc nor the sc limiting laws can be applied without reservations . for such asymmetric coulomb fluids , a generalized _ dressed multivalent - ion approach _ , that bridges the two limits in one single theoretical framework , has been introduced @xcite and tested against extensive explicit- and implicit - ion simulations @xcite .    in counterion - only systems and in the case of uniformly charged surfaces with surface charge density @xmath0 , the strength of the electrostatic interactions is described by the _ electrostatic coupling parameter _",
    "@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is the ratio of the rescaled bjerrum length , @xmath2 with @xmath3 , that measures the strength of electrostatic interactions between counterions of charge valency @xmath4 , and the gouy - chapman length , @xmath5 , that measures the strength of electrostatic interaction between a counterion and the surface charge in the units of thermal energy @xmath6 ( conventionally , we take @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) . in the wc regime , @xmath9 ,",
    "typically realized with monovalent counterions , thermal energy is dominant and , therefore , the counterions form a diffuse gas - like phase next to a charged surface that can be described by the mean - field pb theory . in the sc regime , @xmath10 ,",
    "typically realized with multivalent counterions , electrostatic interactions are large enough to reduce the three - dimensional ionic cloud above the charged surface to a quasi - two - dimensional , strongly correlated liquid layer , or even a 2d crystal @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies also revealed that the wc - sc paradigm can be generalized to more complicated and realistic situations usually encountered in experimental context , with an asymmetric coulomb fluid comprising a mixture of mono- and multivalent ions in the vicinity of charged macromolecular interfaces .",
    "neither the wc nor the sc paradigm can be consistently applied to this situation where the system is electrostatically part strongly and part weakly coupled . in this case",
    "_ dressed multivalent - ion theory _ , based on piecewise application of the wc and sc formalism , has been shown to posses a robust regime of validity @xcite .",
    "other cases demanding an extension and/or modification of the wc - sc framework have been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a separate issue , of the nature of the charge distribution on macromolecular surfaces ,",
    "has also received progressively more focused attention . in many cases ,",
    "these surfaces are not only inhomogeneous in terms of the surficial charge configuration , but exhibit a fundamentally disordered distribution of charges @xcite dictated either by the method of sample preparation and/or by the inherent structural properties of the surface materials @xcite .",
    "these disordered systems , with either thermalized , _ annealed _ surface charges @xcite or structurally disordered , _ quenched _ surface charges @xcite ( or even partially annealed or partially quenched ones @xcite ) have received a more rigorous attention , as it is becoming clear that the nature of charge disorder can interfere fundamentally with the behavior of the system approximated with fixed , homogeneous surface charges .    in the most realistic model of the interaction between charged macromolecules , one would thus need to consider not only an asymmetric confined coulomb fluid between macromolecular surfaces , with a mixture of mono- and multivalent salt ions , but also surface charges that exhibit a disordered component .",
    "while off hand this seems to be like a formidable task , detailed calculations have shown that the final results are rather intuitive and revealing @xcite .",
    "first of all , it became clear that , for _ quenched _ charge disorder , which is of interest in this paper , and in the absence of dielectric asymmetry between the solution subphase and the macromolecular surface , there is no disorder - induced effect in the wc regime @xcite .",
    "however , in the sc limit and in the same general regime of parameters , one finds a long - ranged , disorder - induced attraction , which must be added to the repulsive force between equally charged surfaces @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that in the linear wc regime with gaussian field - fluctuations around the mean - field solution , the quenched disorder would lead to repulsive or attractive interactions provided that the system has an inhomogeneous dielectric constant or monovalent salt distribution ( repulsion arises in this case when the medium is more polarizable than the surfaces and vice versa ) @xcite .    just as the coupling parameter @xmath11 quantifies the electrostatic interactions between mobile counterions and fixed , homogeneous surface charges , the _ disorder coupling parameter _",
    ", @xmath12 , quantifies the strength of the disorder - induced effects in the case of disordered surfaces with @xmath13 being the surface charge variance within the gaussian _ ansatz _ for its statistical distribution @xcite . obviously ,",
    "the two coupling parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath14 , are very similar but the latter depends in a noticeably less drastic manner on the valency of the counterions . just as the overall features of the behavior of a system with homogeneous charge distributions depend on the value of @xmath11",
    ", the behavior of a disordered system depends in a very fundamental manner not only on the exact value of @xmath14 , but also on the presence of salt ions and dielectric inhomogeneities (  image charges \" ) in the system @xcite .    here , we study the effective interaction mediated by strongly coupled coulomb fluids between dielectric surfaces carrying quenched , random monopolar charges with equal mean and variance , both when the coulomb fluid consists only of mobile multivalent counterions and when it consists of an asymmetric ionic mixture .",
    "we analyze the consequences that follow from the interplay between surface charge disorder , dielectric and salt image effects , and the strong electrostatic coupling that result from multivalent counterions on the distribution of these ions and the effective interaction pressure they mediate between the surfaces . in a dielectrically homogeneous system",
    ", the multivalent counterions are found to be attracted towards the surfaces with a singular , disorder - induced potential that diverges logarithmically on approach to the surfaces , creating a singular but integrable counterion density profile that exhibits an algebraic divergence at the surfaces with an exponent given by the disorder coupling parameter .",
    "this effect drives the system towards a state of lower thermal ` disorder ' , one that can be described by a renormalized effective temperature , exhibiting thus a remarkable antifragility @xcite reported in a previous work by the present authors @xcite .",
    "we thus find that , in this general context of strongly coupled , disordered systems , anti - fragile behavior is ubiquitous and stems from the interplay of structural and thermal disorder , with the former engendering a decrease in the _ translational entropy _ of multivalent counterions as a consequence of the fact that the disordered charge distribution generates a finite degree of ( non - thermal ) _ configurational entropy_. in the presence of an interfacial dielectric discontinuity , the singular behavior of the counterion density at the surfaces is removed but multivalent counterions are still accumulated much more strongly close to randomly charged surfaces as compared with uniformly charged ones .",
    "the interaction pressure between the surfaces displays in general a highly non - monotonic behavior as a function of the inter - surface separation with a prominent regime of attraction at small to intermediate separations .",
    "this attraction is caused directly by the combined effects from charge disorder and sc electrostatics of multivalent counterions , which dominate the surface - surface repulsion due to the ( equal ) mean charges on the two surfaces and the osmotic pressure of monovalent salt ions residing between them .",
    "these effects are quite significant even with a small degree of surface charge disorder ( variance ) relative to the mean surface charge .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we introduce our model in section [ sec : model ] and present our theoretical formalism in section [ sec : formal ] .",
    "the distribution of multivalent counterions in the disordered counterion - only case is studied in section [ subsec : ci - only ] and the effects of salt ions and dielectric inhomogeneities are considered in section [ subsec : density_salt ] .",
    "the behavior of the effective inter - surface pressure is studied in sections [ subsec : p]-[subsec : dis ] , followed by the conclusion and discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "it should be noted that , we develop the main formalism for an arbitrary shape of the charged boundaries , which we then apply to the specific example of the two planar slabs described above .    the slabs are assumed to be immersed in a solution of dielectric constant @xmath28 containing an asymmetric coulomb fluid composed of a monovalent @xmath29 salt of bulk concentration @xmath30 and a multivalent @xmath31 salt of bulk concentration @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the charge valency of multivalent counterions .",

    "the problem of an asymmetric coulomb fluid containing monovalent and multivalent ions next to charged macromolecular surfaces is a complicated one , mainly because different components of the coulomb fluid couple differently to the surface charges : multivalent counterions tend to couple strongly , and therefore generate non - mean - field effects , whereas monovalent anions and cations couple weakly , and are thus expected to follow the standard mean - field paradigms as they would in the absence of multivalent ions @xcite .",
    "strong coupling effects due to multivalent counterions within the counterion - only models can be described well using the recent sc theories that have been studied thoroughly over the last several years ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of an asymmetric coulomb fluid , although it is not _ a priori _ clear if a single approximation can be introduced in order to describe the hybrid nature of the electrostatic couplings in the presence of charged boundaries , it turns out that a simple generalization of the counterion - only sc theory @xcite , dubbed _ dressed multivalent - ion theory _ , provides a very good approximation in a large part of the parameter space as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "this approach is obtained by first tracing the partition function over the degrees of freedom associated with monovalent ions within a linearization approximation and then virial expanding it with respect to the fugacity of multivalent counterions .",
    "both these steps can be justified systematically @xcite only in the case of highly asymmetric mixtures with a sufficiently large counterion valency @xmath4 and provided that the bulk concentration of multivalent counterions is relatively small ( as is often the case in experimental systems containing asymmetric ionic mixtures @xcite ) ; because otherwise the different ionic species in the solution can not be treated on such different levels . the dressed multivalent - ion theory described and reviewed recently @xcite bridges",

    "this interaction pressure can be calculated from the standard lifshitz theory as ( in actual units ) @xcite @xmath226 where the first term comes from the zero - frequency mode of the electromagnetic field - fluctuations and the second term comes from the higher - order matsubara frequencies .",
    "@xmath227 is the so - called hamaker coefficient , which we take as @xmath228 ( upper bound for the non - zero matsubara modes in the case of hydrocarbon slabs interacting across an aqueous medium @xcite ) . for slabs of lower dielectric polarizability than the solvent , such as the cases considered here , the vdw interaction is attractive . in the figures ,",

    "these effects are however masked by the multivalent counterions contribution , @xmath187 .    if @xmath14 is increased further ( fig .",

    "]    we can thus conclude that the qualitative differences found between the interaction pressure curves in the non - disordered and disordered systems are closely connected with the behavior of the multivalent counterions contribution , @xmath187 , that becomes significantly more attractive and dominant at small to intermediate separations when the disorder strength is increased , which explains the trends observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : inf_pressure]a ) .",
    "we should emphasize that the increase in the strength of this attractive component is due to the fact that a larger amount of multivalent counterions are pulled into the slit region because of the stronger counterion - surface attractions in the presence of disorder , mediating also a stronger inter - surface attraction .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the effective interactions mediated by multivalent counterions between dielectric slabs that carry a quenched , random monopolar charge distribution on their juxtaposed , plane - parallel , inner surfaces .",
    "we have considered both a case in which the coulomb fluid in the slit between the slabs consists only of mobile multivalent counterions , and also a case in which the coulomb fluid is an asymmetric ionic mixture containing a @xmath31 salt ( with multivalent counterions of charge valency @xmath231 ) and a monovalent @xmath29 salt in equilibrium with a bulk reservoir .",
    "our goal has been to elucidate the effects due to the coupling between the charge disorder and electrostatic correlations in the so - called strong coupling ( sc ) regime , realized experimentally when the system contains mobile multivalent counterions , that give rise to strong surface - counterion correlations and also , to subleading orders , counterion - counterion correlations .",
    "the counter - intuitive phenomena in sc electrostatics , such as attraction between like - charged surfaces , have been well - studied in the case of non - disordered ( and , in most cases , uniformly charged ) macromlecular surfaces ( see , e.g. , recent reviews in refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the sc effects have , however , remained largely unexplored in the situation where the bounding ( macromolecular ) surfaces bear quenched , disordered charge distributions . in the weak coupling ( wc )",
    "regime , where , e.g. , all ions in the coulomb fluid are monovalent , the quenched charge disorder on bounding surfaces turns out to have either no or only very small effects and does not lead to any qualitatively new features in the behavior of the coulomb fluid @xcite . in the sc regime ,",
    "the interaction of quenched random charge distributions across a coulomb fluid has been considered only within the plane - parallel counterion - only model with no interfacial dielectric discontinuity @xcite .",
    "it was shown that quenched surface charge disorder leads to a renormalization ( reduction ) of the entropic contributions to the interaction free energy ( corresponding to a renormalized effective temperature ) , and that for sufficiently large disorder coupling parameter , i.e. , @xmath232 , the surfaces undergo a continuous transition to a collapsed state .",
    "in the present work , we have derived a generalized dressed multivalent - ion formalism that incorporates dielectric image effects as well as salt screening and salt image effects , being applicable to any arbitrary geometry of the bounding surfaces with disordered charge distributions .",
    "the charge disorder over the bounding surfaces is assumed to be gaussian , without any spatial correlations , with possible generalizations to be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the limiting case of this generalized model in the case of a single randomly charged dielectric slab has been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the prediction of the present theory in the specific example of two plane - parallel dielectric slabs with randomly charged inner surfaces immersed in an asymmetric coulomb fluids .",
    "we have shown that , in a dielectrically homogeneous system ( with or without additional salt ) , the multivalent counterions are attracted towards the surfaces with a singular , disorder - induced potential that diverges logarithmically in the vicinity of the surfaces ; this creates a singular but integrable counterion density profile that exhibits an algebraic divergence at the surfaces with an exponent that depends on the disorder coupling parameter , @xmath14 . remarkably , this behavior is in contrast with the contact - value theorem , which describes the behavior of counterions at uniformly charged surfaces and predicts a finite contact density @xcite .",

    "we thus show here that such a behavior follows as a result of the singular accumulation of counterions in the immediate vicinity of the two surfaces , resulting in a renormalized temperature for the system .",
    "this notion of a renormalized temperature should be used with caution because first , this particular form of the renormalization of the system entropy is found only in the sc limit of the two - surface counterion - only model , and secondly , one can show that the renormalization in fact originates from both energetic and entropic sources .",
    "nevertheless , the interplay between the translational entropy of strongly coupled counterions and the ( non - thermal ) configurational entropy , due to the averaging over different realizations of the quenched disorder , does result in the _ anti - fragile _ behavior @xcite of multivalent counterions .",
    "antifragility does not only result in a more ` ordered ' state , characterized by a diminished intrinsic thermal ` disorder ' induced by the externally imposed disorder , but also in a thermodynamically more stable state since quenched surface charge disorder engenders also a lower free energy as compared with a non - disordered system .",
    "the appearance of antifragility is possibly one of the most fundamental and perplexing features in the complicated coulomb world , whose ramifications we are only beginning to unravel .",
    "the singular behavior of the multivalent counterion density on approach to randomly charged surfaces persists also when the dielectrically homogeneous system contains an additional monovalent salt component .",
    "the mobile monovalent salt ions generate screening effects at intermediate to large distances ( comparable to the debye screening length ) , while at small to intermediate distances from the bounding surfaces , we find a narrow region where the multivalent counterions are partially depleted from the vicinity of the surfaces because of the salt image repulsions .",
    "this depletion effect arises because of the inhomogeneous distribution of the monovalent salt ions in the system ( as the slabs are assumed to be impermeable to these ions ) but its overall effect is quite weak and , when the surfaces are randomly charged , gives way to the singular attraction of counterions by disordered surface charges at small separations .",
    "this salt image ( or screening - induced ) depletion is in contrast with the depletion due to dielectric images , which in dielectrically inhomogeneous systems always dominates in the vicinity of the dielectric surfaces and creates an interfacial zone of complete depletion , even when the bounding surfaces of the slabs are randomly charged .",
    "the reason being the repulsive ion - surface potential generated by the dielectric images that diverges at a dielectric surface ( with @xmath216 ) in a way that overcomes the disorder - induced attraction experienced by the multivalent counterions at small distances from the surfaces . the amount of multivalent counterions accumulated at some short distance away the dielectric surface is , however , still overall enhanced because of the disorder - induced attraction .",
    "we have also analyzed in detail the consequences that result from the interplay between charge disorder , dielectric and salt images , and the sc effects on the effective interaction pressure between the slabs .",
    "the interaction pressure shows in general a highly non - monotonic behavior as a function of the separation distance between the inner surfaces of the slabs . at small to intermediate separations ( e.g. , typically within a few nanometers )",
    ", the sc effects can be quite significant .",
    "they contribute an attractive component to the net interaction pressure that opposes the repulsive osmotic pressure due to monovalent salt ions and the repulsive interaction between the mean surface charges on the two slabs . in the absence of disorder",
    ", this sc attraction between the two like - charged surfaces becomes dominant when the bulk concentration of multivalent counterions is increased and/or when the salt screening parameter or the dielectric discontinuity parameter are decreased .",
    "nevertheless , when the inter - surface separation decreases , the pressure at very small separations becomes repulsive once again since counterions are completely depleted from the slit due to dielectric image repulsions . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "counterions are attracted to the surface much more strongly than in the absence of disorder and a much larger number of counterions are sucked into the slab region from the bulk . as a result ,",
    "the sc attraction mediated by multivalent counterions between the disordered charged surfaces becomes increasingly more enhanced , especially as the disorder coupling parameter and/or the bulk concentration of multivalent counterions are increased .",
    "the repulsive regime at small separations , which could stabilize the surfaces in the absence of disorder , is thus squeezed down to zero due to extremely large attractive pressures acting on the slabs .",
    "we have presented our results in a rescaled ( dimensionless ) form , in terms of a few dimensionless parameters such as the rescaled screening parameter and the electrostatic and disorder coupling parameters .",
    "these parameters , for any given set of values , can be mapped to a wide range of values for the actual parameters , namely , the counterion and salt bulk concentrations , mean surface charge density , counterion valency , solvent dielectric constant , temperature , etc .",
    "a few typical examples of the physical parameter values that can correspond to some typical values of the rescaled parameters are shown in table [ table ] ; other sets of physical parameter values are conceivable , e.g. , by using divalent and trivalent counterions or other surface charge densities , etc . it should be noted that the range of values we have used for the disorder coupling parameter , i.e. , @xmath241 , corresponds to typically small degrees of charge disorder with disorder variances of around @xmath242 that can be achieved by relatively small surface density of impurity charges ( @xmath243 ) as compared with the mean number of surface charges ( typically @xmath244 ) . in other words",
    ", the effects due to the coupling between surface charge randomness and the sc electrostatics due to mobile multivalent counterions can be quite significant even at very small degrees of the surface charge disorder .",
    "the regime of applicability of the dressed multivalent - ion theory ( which can be justified strictly only in the case of highly asymmetric coulomb fluids @xcite ) has been discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite by making extensive comparison with implicit- and explicit - ion simulations in non - disordered systems , where it is found to be in the experimentally accessible parameter space .",
    "this includes the situations where electrostatic interactions are strong enough so that the effects of multivalent counterions next to an oppositely charged boundary is adequately included on the lowest order single - particle level @xcite .",
    "the higher - order effects of multi - particle interactions between counterions are assumed to be sufficiently weak for moderate to high salt concentrations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the present approach is expected to be applicable for relatively small ( a few mm ) bulk concentrations of the multivalent counterions , which is in fact the typical case in most experiments ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "we expect that the previously determined regimes of validity hold also for the present case with randomly charged surfaces , although this remains to be determined more systematically through extensive computer simulations that are still missing for the disordered systems .",
    "our results yield concrete predictions that can be tested against these future simulations . the fingerprints of disorder effects can show up in surface - force measurements as well ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein for charge disorder effects in the context of casimir force measurements and refs .",
    "@xcite for force measurement between surfactant - coated surfaces in aqueous media ) .",
    "one should , however , note that the precise statistical distribution of charge disorder in real systems can be sample and material dependent and it can vary depending also on the method of preparation .",
    "these points need to be addressed first if the theoretical predictions are to be compared against experiments .",
    "the present study is based on a primitive model of coulomb fluids and makes a few simplifying assumptions that have been discussed elsewhere in detail ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for instance",
    ", we have neglected the solvent structure ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) , the polarizability of mobile ions ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) , specific surface ion - adsorption effects @xcite , and the size and internal structure of the counterions @xcite . for multivalent counterions that can be modeled as spherical particles ,",
    "their finite size can be incorporated in our approach in a straightforward manner as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "it is important to note that most multivalent counterion possess an internal charge distribution that can introduce higher - order multipolar effects ; these effects can be quite significant especially for multivalent counterions that have an extended structure ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) , including rod - like polyamines such as the trivalent spermidine and tetravalent spermine that have chain lengths of up to 1 - 1.5  nm @xcite .",
    "we plan to address this issues in future publications .",
    "other cases that can be studied in the present context in the future include spatially correlated surface charge disorder @xcite as well as surfaces with annealed ( mobile ) disordered charges @xcite , surfaces with partially quenched or partially annealed charges @xcite , and also charge regulating surfaces @xcite .",
    "another point to be noted is that , in systems containing added monovalent salt , our theoretical approach may become invalid when the mean electrostatic potential near the randomly charged surfaces becomes large , in which case the validity of the underlying dh approximation used for the monovalent ions can break down @xcite .",
    "this can happen when the disorder strength is large and/or when the dielectric discontinuity parameter is small .",
    "other cases that goes beyond the present framework include the situation where nonlinear charge renormalization and/or bjerrum pairing effects become relevant ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . these latter effects , however , turn out to be negligible in the regime of parameters that is of interest here @xcite .",
