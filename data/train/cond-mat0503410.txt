    "in heavy - fermion systems , a magnetic instability can be reached by tuning a parameter @xmath4 such as pressure , magnetic field or doping .",
    "this instability is obtained at a critical value @xmath5 of the tuning parameter and it separates a paramagnetic ground state for @xmath6 from a magnetically ordered ground state for @xmath7 : a quantum phase transition ( defined at @xmath8 ) between those two states is thus induced at @xmath5 . while far from @xmath5 the paramagnetic state is well described by landau s fermi liquid theory with a strongly - renormalized effective mass @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the free electron mass ) , a non - fermi liquid behavior is generally reported at the magnetic instability . in this regime ,",
    "the specific heat , the susceptibility and the resistivity follow power or logarithmic temperature laws , which are different from the laws expected for a fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "this non - fermi liquid behavior is probably related both to the @xmath11-dependence of the excitation spectra and to the effects of temperature @xcite . however ,",
    "this regime is not yet explained for heavy fermions , its understanding being now one of the major stakes in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "recently , several inelastic neutron scattering studies of heavy - fermion systems at their quantum phase transition were performed with the aim to obtain scaling laws of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the energy transfer and @xmath14 the temperature @xcite . in those works",
    ", the imaginary part @xmath15 of the dynamical susceptibility was found to follow scaling laws of the form : @xmath16 down to @xmath8 , with @xmath17 .",
    "these laws were interpreted as a consequence of the divergence of the magnetic excitations when @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which is responsible for the non - fermi liquid behavior of these critical systems .",
    "for example , the study carried out by schrder et al .",
    "on cecu@xmath20au@xmath21 led to the conclusions that a general scaling law of the form ( [ scal ] ) is obtained down to @xmath8 with a unique exponent @xmath22 for each wavevector of the reciprocal space @xcite : this work motivated several new theoretical developments , such as models based on a local criticality @xcite .    in this letter , we show how it is possible to obtain artificial scaling laws of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility when the data are not carefully analyzed .",
    "we consider already published data corresponding to the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of the heavy - fermion system ce@xmath23la@xmath24ru@xmath2si@xmath2 at its magnetic instability @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we explain how erroneous scaling laws can be obtained in a low temperature regime where the dynamical magnetic susceptibility depends weakly on @xmath14 . in such a nearly t - independent regime , @xmath26 scaling laws are irrelevant .",
    "we recall here results concerning the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of the heavy - fermion compound ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these excitations are measured at a momentum transfer @xmath27 , which corresponds to a correlated signal with the wavevector @xmath28 = ( 0.31,0,0 ) .",
    "knowing that the scattered intensity is proportional to the scattering function @xmath29 , the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath30 is deduced using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath31 then , the susceptibility is fitted with a single quasielastic lorentzian shape : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the static susceptibility and the relaxation rate of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the variations with @xmath14 of those two parameters are plotted in figure [ largint ] .",
    "we obtain that the dynamical susceptibility depends weakly on @xmath14 for @xmath35 , with @xmath36 k. in this regime , the static susceptibility and the relaxation rate are given approximately by : @xmath37 for @xmath38 , the susceptibility becomes controlled by @xmath14 and we have : @xmath39 this is only in this high temperature regime that antiferromagnetic fluctuations follow a scaling law : using ( [ lor ] ) and ( [ ht ] ) , we obtain immediately : @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in figure",
    "[ scaling ] , this scaling behavior is plotted for temperatures @xmath38 and all the data collapse effectively on a single curve . this law does not enter the framework of usual quantum phase transition theories , where @xmath43 can not be smaller than 1 @xcite .",
    "the reason is that those theories do not consider the temperature dependence of the kondo local magnetic fluctuations . in the studies reported in references @xcite",
    ", we also showed that it is necessary to consider the spectra at different wavevectors corresponding respectively to antiferromagnetic fluctuations and to local magnetic fluctuations .",
    "several studies of heavy - fermion systems at their quantum phase transition report different kinds of scaling laws of the general form @xcite : @xmath44 in our study of ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 , each spectrum is analyzed separately at a given momentum transfer @xmath11 and at a given temperature @xmath14 .",
    "then , for the antiferromagnetic fluctuations measured at the wavevector @xmath45 , we deduced the exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the temperature dependance of the static susceptibility and of the relaxation rate . in the literature ,",
    "the scaling laws are often obtained as follows : @xmath43 is fixed to 1 and @xmath48 is chosen for the best collapse of the data on a single curve when @xmath49 is plotted against @xmath3 .",
    "we show here how such a method can lead to erroneous results and to contradictions with the real physics of the system .",
    "in fact , for each value of @xmath43 it is possible to obtain an optimal value of @xmath48 so that the data collapse in a single curve , this artificial scaling law being sometimes restricted to some ranges of temperatures and/or energies .",
    "+ let us consider the example of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 .",
    "figures [ scaling2 ] and [ scaling3 ] correspond to the plot of @xmath50 against @xmath51 , where @xmath43 is fixed and @xmath48 is chosen for the best collapse of the data on a single curve .",
    "we see in figure [ scaling2 ] that when @xmath52 , the best collapse of the data is obtained for @xmath46 and is followed for temperatures from 80 k down to 40 mk . in figure",
    "[ scaling3 ] , we fix @xmath53 and the best collapse of the data is found for @xmath54 , corresponding to temperatures from 16 k to 40 mk . in this second graph ,",
    "a collapse of the data on a single curve is not obtained for @xmath55 k. +    from the results summarized in section 2 , we know that the antiferromagnetic dynamical susceptibility is almost @xmath14- independent for @xmath35 , and consequently that this low temperature regime can not correspond to any scaling law in @xmath3 .",
    "the plots of figures [ scaling2 ] and [ scaling3 ] correspond thus to artificial scaling laws , the collapse of the low temperature data in a single curve coming not from some intrinsic physics .",
    "in fact , the regime @xmath56 is characterized by the nearly @xmath14-independent dynamical susceptibility : @xmath57 knowing that @xmath58 mev and that our data correspond to energy transfers @xmath59 mev , we can make the approximation @xmath60 , so that : @xmath61 the dynamical susceptibility can then be written as : @xmath62 which means that an optimal collapse of the data measured at the temperatures @xmath56 will be obtained for @xmath63 , when @xmath50 is plotted against @xmath51 . in a @xmath64-@xmath64 plot of @xmath65 as a function of @xmath13 , the almost @xmath14-independent spectrum which is obtained for @xmath35 corresponds to a segment of a straight line of slope -1 .",
    "when @xmath50 is plotted against @xmath66 , it leads to a shift of this segment on the same straight line .",
    "this simple geometric construction is the only origin of the artificial scaling .",
    "+ figures [ scaling2 ] and [ scaling3 ] correspond effectively to two cases of artificial scaling laws of the form ( [ lorquasielfit4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , those erroneous laws are not only obtained for the low temperature data , but also for parts of the high temperature data .",
    "indeed , figure [ scaling2 ] is characterized for @xmath38 by a collapse of the data in a single curve , since the values @xmath46 and @xmath52 are very close to the correct values @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in figure",
    "[ scaling3 ] , the exponents @xmath54 and @xmath53 are quite different from the correct values @xmath46 and @xmath47 . as a consequence ,",
    "the artificial scaling law is obtained only up to 16 k and for @xmath55 k , the data do not collapse any more in a single curve .",
    "we recall that the only @xmath51 scaling behavior of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 corresponds to the temperature regime @xmath38 , with the exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as explained in section 2 .",
    "+ other kinds of artificial scaling laws can also be obtained for non lorentzian spectra : at sufficiently small temperatures , when the dynamical magnetic susceptibility is nearly @xmath14-independent such as , instead of ( [ lorquasielfit3 ] ) : @xmath67 we obtain immediately : @xmath68 an artificial scaling law can thus be plotted with @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath43 is fixed , a collapse of the low temperature data in a single curve is consequently obtained for an exponent @xmath70 .",
    "this signifies that , when @xmath43 is fixed to 1 , an artificial scaling law of the form ( [ scal ] ) is obtained with the exponent @xmath71 .",
    "+ finally , depending on the temperature and energy ranges which are considered , but also on the shape of the spectra , several kinds of erroneous scaling laws can be plotted .",
    "equations ( [ lorquasielfit4 ] ) and ( [ lorquasielfit6 ] ) are just two examples of such artificial scaling laws .",
    "we illustrate the former case using the graphs of the figures [ scaling2 ] and [ scaling3 ] , where @xmath46 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "those two graphs could be taken as proofs of diverging fluctuations for @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , the plot of figure [ scaling3 ] could be abusively interpreted as a verification of quantum phase transition theories for an itinerant system @xcite .",
    "actually , for the spatial dimension @xmath74 and the critical exponent @xmath75 corresponding to ce@xmath23la@xmath24ru@xmath2si@xmath2 , such models predict i ) that the anomalous exponents of the scaling law ( [ scalgen ] ) are @xmath72 and @xmath76 , ii ) that the fluctuations should diverge for @xmath18 and iii ) that this law would not been verified for temperatures bigger than the kondo temperature , which is here equal to 18 k @xcite . however , we know that this is not verified in ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 since the fluctuations saturate below @xmath77 k and thus no scaling can be obtained in the low temperature regime of the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "this illustrates perfectly the dangers of a unique graphical determination of scaling laws of the form @xmath78 .",
    "in this letter , we used the specific example of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of ce@xmath0la@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 to show how erroneous @xmath3 scaling laws of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility can be plotted .",
    "such artificial scaling laws are obtained when the exponents @xmath48 and @xmath43 are only determined graphically , as done in section 3 , and come just from a simple geometric construction .",
    "this can lead to misunderstand the physics of the system ; the erroneous scaling laws shown here are plotted without any divergence of the fluctuations , while such @xmath3 scaling laws obtained down to @xmath8 should be associated to diverging fluctuations .",
    "we stress thus that a scaling behavior can only be established after a precise study of the temperature dependence of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility and of the parameters which characterize it , as shown in section 2 .",
    "a great care has also to be given to the @xmath79-dependence of those spectra and to the corresponding scaling laws @xcite .",
