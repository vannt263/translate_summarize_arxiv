    "we observed ngc  5383 in a broad band ( @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath1 1240  ) r - filter and a narrow band ( @xmath14 @xmath15 = 25  ) filter at the 1.5 m telescope at palomar on the night of 2 june , 1994 with a 2048 @xmath16 2048 ccd camera in direct imaging mode . in this mode",
    "the camera has a 12@xmath77 field of view with 0@xmath1737 pixels . using the r - band filter we obtained one 300 s and one 600 s exposures which were co - added to obtain a single r - band image .",
    "the image was a single 900 s exposure .",
    "the effective resolution was 1@xmath175 in the r - band image and 2@xmath174 in the image .",
    "for both images we divided by a normalized flat - field frame , subtracted the mean sky brightness , and removed cosmic rays using standard routines in the noao / iraf software package .",
    "we also corrected all images for atmospheric extinction .",
    "we used the standard stars bd+26.2606 and bd+17.4703 for absolute flux calibration using the absolute photometry by oke & gunn ( 1983 ) .",
    "finally , we registered foreground stars in each image with the hubble guide star catalog ( gsc ) and determined astrometric solutions for each image .",
    "the residuals in determining absolute positions are smaller than 0@xmath1703 ; however , systematic errors in the gsc prevent us from achieving an accuracy @xmath18 1@xmath13 .",
    "we used the r - band image to subtract the underlying continuum from the image .",
    "the final continuum - subtracted line image is shown in figure [ hafig ] .",
    "we observed ngc  5383 in the near - infrared j and k@xmath19 bands ( wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) on the nights of 1 , 4 march 1994 at the 1.3 m telescope on kitt peak using the cryogenic optical bench ( cob ) .",
    "the cob used a 256 @xmath16 256 insb detector with 0@xmath1795 pixels ( @xmath14@xmath20 field of view ) .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 24 minutes in the j band and 52 minutes in the k@xmath19 band .",
    "the effective resolution is 2@xmath174 in the k@xmath19 band image and 2@xmath13 in the j band image .",
    "the data were reduced via the procedure described by regan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . since the k@xmath19 band image traces light primarily from the old stars which are good tracers of the gravitational potential , figure [ kbandfig ] is shown to emphasize the bar potential in ngc  5383 .",
    "we observed the nucleus of ngc  5383 with the f160w filter on camera 2 of the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) in the hubble space telescope on 13 october 1997 .",
    "the f160w filter is an approximate match to ground - based near infrared h - band filters and has a central wavelength of 1.6 .",
    "our total integration time on source was 704 seconds .",
    "the detector on camera 2 is a 256@xmath16256 hgcdte detector with a plate scale of 0.075 arc seconds pixel  yielding a field of view of 192 . during the time period of the observations",
    "the pipeline data reduction for nicmos was still under development leading to output of the pipeline process that was not the best possible calibration of the data .",
    "therefore , we re - calibrated the images using the latest flat fields , darks , and non - linearity files .",
    "we observed co ( j=1 - 0 ) line emission in ngc  5383 with the bima ( berkeley - illinois - maryland association ) array in three different configurations of six dishes from february - june 1994 , and in a compact configuration of nine dishes from july - august 1996 .",
    "the phase and pointing center for these observations was @xmath0(j2000 ) = 13@xmath257@xmath304@xmath4.54 , @xmath21(j2000 ) = 41@xmath950@xmath19 46@xmath1700 .",
    "the correlator window was centered at v@xmath22 = 2245  with a total bandwidth of 424   and a resolution of 4.1 . in each case",
    "the line emission was observed in the upper sideband .",
    "the projected baselines ranged from 2.2 to 87.5 k@xmath15 and the single - sideband system temperatures ranged from 500 to 1100 k. we flagged the data with anomalous visibilities resulting from shadowing of an antenna at low elevation and spurious electronic spikes ( birdies and correlator window edges ) .",
    "the complex instrumental gain was calibrated using the quasars 1153 + 495 , 1419 + 543 or 1310 + 323 , observed every 20 - 30 minutes .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was determined from observations of uranus or mars and the structure of the if band pass was determined from observations of the quasars 3c273 or 3c279 .",
    "we imaged the calibrated data set into 10  channels using natural weighting to achieve maximum signal to noise ratio and then cleaned the dirty maps using the hogbm algorithm ( hogbm 1974 ) .",
    "next we employed an iterative phase - only self - calibration process ( thompson , moran , & swenson 1986 ; regan et al . 1995 ) which used the clean components as model inputs for the iterations .",
    "the self - calibration process did not significantly improve the results because our initial atmospheric phase calibration was good .",
    "in other words , our data are limited by thermal noise rather than the dynamic range .",
    "the synthesized beam in the maps is 4@xmath1762 @xmath16 4@xmath1723 at a position angle of 17 degrees .",
    "the final channel maps have a noise level of 50 mjy beam@xmath12 .",
    "we summed over all pixels in the data cube with @xmath23s@xmath24@xmath23 @xmath25 2@xmath26 to form a velocity - integrated total intensity map which is shown in figure [ cofig ] .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of the center of ngc  5383 in the co ( j=10 ) emission line with the single dish , 12 m nrao telescope on 01 december 1998 .",
    "the half - power primary beamwidth of the telescope is 53@xmath13 and the pointing accuracy is @xmath8 5@xmath13 .",
    "we used the spectral line beam position switching observing mode with a 4@xmath20 throw for the off position .",
    "the total on - source integration time was nine minutes with a system temperature of @xmath1350 k. the filter banks were configured in the 2 @xmath16 2 mhz series mode for a total bandwidth of 512 mhz .",
    "an unstable oscillation in one channel prevented us from using data from both channels .",
    "the measured rms noise in a 2 mhz channel is 19.5 mk .",
    "a zeroth order baseline was subtracted from each of the three scans before they were co - added ; the resulting spectrum is shown in figure [ cosdfig ] .",
    "co emission is detected in the central 3.5 kpc diameter region of the ngc 5383 .",
    "we find two prominent co peaks ( labeled ci , cii in figure [ cofig ] ) in the total intensity map , corresponding to the inner termini of the dust lanes .",
    "in addition to these two peaks , we see a third peak ( labeled ciii in figure [ cofig ] ) east - southeast of peak i. peak ciii lies along the northwestern dust lane after it has curved and is heading east across the nuclear region .",
    "there is co emission in an even weaker feature ( labeled iv ) 5@xmath13 north of ciii .",
    "this feature coincides with the most intense star forming region in the nucleus .    within the primary beam ( 53@xmath13 fwhm ) of the nrao 12 m telescope , the total co flux in the bima interferometer maps",
    "is @xmath1175 jy .",
    "this is about 60% of the flux ( 9 k ) measured from the nrao spectrum , assuming a conversion factor of 33 jy k@xmath12 for the 12 m telescope .",
    "most of the co detected by the interferometer is concentrated in the central 35@xmath13 of ngc 5383 . the co flux in this 35@xmath13 region ( 165 jy )",
    "can be converted to a total h@xmath27 mass using the standard equation m(h@xmath27 ) = 1.1 @xmath16 10@xmath28 d@xmath29 s@xmath30 ( kenney et al . 1992 ) , where d is in mpc and s@xmath30 is in jy . for the adopted distance of 32.4 mpc ,",
    "the total molecular gas mass is @xmath12 @xmath1610@xmath31 .",
    "we have divided the r and j band images into the k@xmath19 band image to form color maps ( see figure [ dustfig ] ) .",
    "prior to division , the images were registered against each other and the higher resolution images were smoothed to match the lower resolution ( 2@xmath174 ) of the k@xmath19 band image . in both maps",
    "the darker grey scale corresponds to redder colors ( higher extinction ) .",
    "although it is difficult to estimate the dust content in galaxies , it has been shown that optical - infrared colors such as r@xmath32k@xmath19 and infrared - infrared colors such as j@xmath32k@xmath19 can be used to estimate the amount of dust using multiple scattering radiative transfer models ( regan et al .",
    "1995 ) ; however , such models require images at multiple optical and infrared wavelengths to confidently parameterize the optical depth and the ratio of dust scale height relative to the stars . even though the lack of multiple images at different wavelengths prevents us from this quantitative analysis",
    ", we can still gain a qualitative understanding of the dust distribution from the two colors available to us .",
    "in both maps , the main bar dust lanes show up as regions of high extinction . in the r@xmath32k@xmath19 map ,",
    "the northwestern dust lane is relatively straight and narrow with at least two spurs ( indicated by arrows in figure [ dustfig ] ) , which merge into the dust lane , and end in areas with high levels of dust extinction . in the southeastern dust lane the spurs and the dust lane are difficult to distinguish from each other , and the dust lane characteristics are harder to describe .",
    "however , this dust lane is seen more clearly in the j@xmath32k@xmath19 color map , where its appearance and structure is similar to the northwestern lane .",
    "note that the northwestern dust lane , on the other hand , is not clearly visible in the j@xmath32k@xmath19 map .",
    "the differences between the two color maps could be due to a variety of reasons such as different dust lane thicknesses , geometry of the dust / star mixture ( witt 1992 ) , systematic reddening of the near side of a galaxy based on its orientation in the sky ( e.g. elmegreen & block , 1999 ) , or the more remote possibility that the stellar populations are different between the two sides of the bar .    at the inner terminus of the dust lanes where the dust lanes begin to curve , two red peaks mark locations of the highest dust extinction .",
    "these dust extinction `` twin peaks '' match the peaks seen in co emission .",
    "interior to these peaks , a s - shaped curve is traced in dust extinction similar to the curve seen in co emission . at the center of the s - shaped curve",
    "we find a peak with the reddest color in the map .",
    "since this central peak coincides with the peak of k@xmath19 band emission it probably reflects excess k@xmath19 band emission from either a change in the underlying stellar population ( excess red giant stars ) , or hot dust ( e.g. , thatte et al .",
    "1997 ; marco & alloin 1998 ) , instead of a large amount of dust extinction .",
    "the s - shaped structure , the dust lanes and the spurs , however , can not be due to k@xmath19 band emission excesses because the k@xmath19 band emission is much smoother ( figure [ kbandfig ] ) ; hence , these must be due to dust extinction .",
    "strong line emission ( figure [ hafig ] ) is detected in the nucleus , the bar ends and the spiral arms . in the nucleus",
    "the peak emission ( indicated by the label hp in figure [ hafig ] ) is located 3@xmath171 northwest of the radio - continuum peak .",
    "we can clearly trace the northwestern dust lane in absorption against the emission as it curves inwards , 3@xmath13 south of hp .",
    "we also see a bright elongated hii region , 5@xmath13 southwest of hp , along the southern edge of the dust lane .",
    "similarly , there is another bright hii region 11@xmath13 east of hp , near the inner terminus of the southeastern dust lane .",
    "hii regions are also observed at both bar ends and along the spiral arms near the bar ends .",
    "since it is unclear whether the observed hii regions belong to the bar end or the spiral arm , we use the term `` bar end / spiral arm hii regions '' to describe any hii regions in this area . the bar end / spiral arm hii regions mostly trail the bar , although there is at least one bright hii region on the leading side of the bar .",
    "the hii regions extend for about 4 kpc on the trailing side of the spiral arms and about half that distance along the leading side .",
    "the study of star formation activity in these regions is interesting because of the changing environment between the bar ends and spiral arms ( kenney & lord 1991 ) .",
    "however , in this paper , we limit the scope of our study and do not study the star formation activity in these regions .    instead , we choose to focus on the star formation activity in the bar .",
    "while the nuclear region and the bar ends have strong emission , the bar itself is comparatively weak ; this pattern is consistent with observations of other early - type barred galaxies ( garcia - barreto et al . 1996 ; koopmann & kenney 1996 ; phillips 1993 ) .",
    "most of this limited star formation activity in the bar of ngc  5383 is found in one or two bright star formation sites on each side of the bar , along its leading edges .",
    "these peaks are best seen in the contour image of emission in figure [ hadust ] and their significance is discussed in  [ stardust ] .",
    "modeling studies of gas flows in bars constitute an extensive subfield and we refer the reader to excellent reviews in sellwood & wilkinson ( 1993 ) , athanassoula ( 1992a , b ) , teuben ( 1996 ) and references therein .",
    "one can broadly categorize these modeling efforts into two main categories : a ) cloud - based / sticky particle simulations which treat the gas as a set of distinct particles which react to collisions based on some prescription for cloud collisions , and b ) hydrodynamic ( grid - based or smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ) simulations which treat the gas as an ideal fluid obeying the basic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "both classes of models have advantages and disadvantages and both can provide adequate frameworks in which observations can be interpreted .",
    "both classes of models produce dust lanes but the hydrodynamic models alone can produce the straight dust lanes seen in strongly barred galaxies such as ngc  5383 .",
    "both classes predict gas inflow of approximately the same order of magnitude but the exact route followed by the gas is very different in each class of models . in the hydrodynamic model ,",
    "the gas undergoes a shock at the dust lane and is forced to flow directly inwards in the dust lane ( rvt97 , athanassoula 1992b ) . in the cloud - based models ,",
    "the gas clouds in the dust lane behave like those found in galaxy spiral arms .",
    "the dust lane is formed because the clouds crowd together for a longer time . however , unlike the hydrodynamic models , they eventually cross and leave the dust lane on the leading side of the bar . in this model ,",
    "the clouds can collide , lose angular momentum and spiral down to the center in a few orbits ( combes & gerin 1985 ) .",
    "for strong bars , the hydrodynamic model gas flow is the best match to the observed velocity fields ( e.g. , ngc  1530 rvt97 ) .",
    "it is also particularly successful at producing the high shear and shock seen across the bar dust lanes ( athanassoula 1992 ) ; these can not be produced by the cloud - based / sticky particle models ( regan , sheth & vogel 1999 , hereafter rsv99 ) .",
    "moreover , a recent study of gas kinematics in seven barred spirals also shows that the observed gas kinematics are consistent with the hydrodynamic models and not with cloud - based simulations ( rsv 1999 ) .",
    "so even though the molecular ism is certainly not a diffuse , ideal fluid , it appears that the hydrodynamic models are better at reproducing observations than cloud - based / sticky particle models , especially for describing observations of gas kinematics and morphology in strong bars .",
    "hence we choose to compare the co and dust extinction morphology of ngc  5383 to a hydrodynamic model ; the model chosen is the pst95 standard model .      in order to compare the co emission and dust extinction distribution to the hydrodynamic model , we projected the pst95 model ( figure [ modmorph]a ) to match the orientation of ngc  5383 ( figure [ modmorph]b ) and smoothed the model to match the resolutions of the dust extinction and co emission maps ( figures [ modmorph]c , d respectively ) .",
    "the model gas distribution shows an extremely dense nuclear ring with two peaks along the ring near the bar major axis , consistent with pst95 .",
    "however , we emphasize that the location of these peaks varies in the simulations . over time",
    "additional peaks often appear and disappear in the ring , downstream of the dust lane terminus .",
    "the density contrast between the peaks and the dust lane is large ; in the unsmoothed model , the peaks have a column density which is @xmath1 25 to 120 times higher than that in the dust lane , and the average ring column density is @xmath1 25 to 60 times larger . smoothing the models reduces the average density contrast by @xmath150% at the resolution of the dust extinction maps and by @xmath160% at the resolution of the co emission maps .",
    "we also find that the gas density in the dust lane increases inwards along the dust lanes ; from the outer terminus to the inner terminus the density increases by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "the model also produces offset bar dust lanes and an outer , low density ellipsoidal feature .",
    "when we compare figure [ modmorph ] to figures [ cofig ] & [ dustfig ] , we find significant differences between the model gas morphology and the observations .",
    "the most striking disparity is the density contrast between the dust lane gas and the ring / peak gas .",
    "the contrast in the dust extinction maps between the dust lane and the twin peaks is 1.3 in the j@xmath32k@xmath19 map and 1.5 in the r@xmath32k@xmath19 map . at the same resolution ,",
    "the model column density contrast is an order of magnitude ( @xmath1 @xmath168@xmath3240 ) larger . since co is not detected in the dust lanes , only a lower limit to the co brightness ratio between the peaks and the dust lane can be calculated . in ngc  5383 , this ratio is @xmath120 , similar to that observed in ngc  3351 and ngc  6951 ( kenney et al .",
    "in other galaxies where co is detected in the dust lanes ( e.g. ngc 1530 , see figure 11 or table 3 in downes et al .",
    "1996 , or ngc  7479 , see figure 5 in quillen et al .",
    "1995 ) , the co brightness ratio between the ring / peak and the dust lane gas is only @xmath15@xmath3210 ; at the same resolution , the model density contrast is @xmath115@xmath3270 .",
    "one reason for the high co brightness ratio in ngc  5383 may be that the co emissivity per h@xmath27 molecule is enhanced in nuclear region ( regan et al . 1995 ) or at least at the twin peaks .",
    "since variations in co emissivity may determine the co brightness ratio , dust extinction is perhaps a better tracer of the gas column density because the gas to dust ratio is better constrained than the co to h@xmath27 conversion factor ( sodroski et al .",
    "1995 ; regan 2000 ) .",
    "conversion factor is an upper limit ] therefore comparing the dust extinction maps to the model , we conclude that the ratio of the ring to the dust lane gas surface density is an order of magnitude larger than seen in the observations .",
    "another striking difference between the model and the observations is the central morphology of gas and dust . in the pst95 study , a nuclear ring always formed whenever",
    "the bar had offset dust lanes ( i.e. had an ilr ) , and whenever the bar was thick ( axial ratio @xmath18 5 ) . in ngc  5383 both of these conditions",
    "are met , yet there is no sign of a nuclear ring ; instead , as described in  [ comorph ] and  [ dustmorph ] , the gas and the dust are distributed in a s - shaped pattern with three peaks . in some galaxies , e.g. ngc  1530 ( regan et al . 1995 ) , higher resolution co maps have resolved the twin peaks structure into a broken ring or partial spiral arms . in ngc  5383 , however , higher resolution uniform weighted maps ( not shown ) do not reveal a ring ; they show the same triple peak structure seen in the lower resolution co map .",
    "also , the dust extinction maps , which are at a higher resolution than the co maps , do not show a ring . in some other `` twin peak '' galaxies , e.g. ngc  6951 , ngc  3351 and m101 ,",
    "a nuclear ring of hii regions has been observed ( kenney et al .",
    ". however , we see no evidence of an ring in our data ; the emission is amorphous and is dominated by the bright peak north of the nucleus ( see figure [ hafig ] ) .",
    "while it is possible that an ring can be obscured by highly variable and patchy dust extinction in the nuclear region ( phillips 1993 ) , the dust distribution in ngc  5383 is not ring - shaped and can not hide an hii ring .",
    "at this point , it worthwhile to mention that the co morphology in the center of bars can have a rich variety of morphologies in addition to `` twin peaks . '' as kenney ( 1996 ) points out , there are spiral arms as in ngc  6951 ( kenney 1996 ) , filled exponential disks as in ngc  3504 ( kenney , carlstrom & young 1993 ) or ngc  4102 , and rings or partial rings as in ngc  4314 ( benedict , smith & kenney 1996 ) .",
    "so although we are only examining a single case , the failure of the hydrodynamic models to produce these morphologies in general is problematic .",
    "lastly , the models differ from the ngc  5383 observations because they produce a low density , ellipsoidal feature which encircles the bar region .",
    "the ellipsoid is present in the models throughout the simulation , and while its density varies , the density is always fairly low .",
    "this feature is not detected in our observations , and we are not aware of any barred galaxy with such a molecular gas feature ; this may be due to the lack of sensitivity of current millimeter wavelength interferometers .",
    "the ellipsoidal feature probably correspond to the inner ring seen in optical images of other galaxies presented in the review by buta & combes ( 1996 ) .",
    "the inner ring is usually a ring or ellipse of star formation which encircles the bar and may be associated with a 4:1 ultraharmonic resonance ( buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "good examples of this feature are seen in the continuum - subtracted images of ngc  3504 ( kenney et al .",
    "1993 ) and ngc  6782 , ugc  12646 , ic  5240 ( crocker , baugus & buta 1996 ) . before we can discuss the importance and relevance of this feature to gas flows in bars",
    ", we would need to obtain additional observations of molecular gas emission and dust extinction to identify the feature , and we would need to study the models more carefully to establish the role of the gas in this ellipsoidal feature .",
    "while there are many discrepancies between the model gas distribution and the observations , there are also some similarities .",
    "as already shown by a92 , both straight and curved bar dust lanes are reproduced as a function of the bar strength by the hydrodynamic model . in our study , the model ( figure [ modmorph ] ) predicts increasing gas density inwards in the dust lane ; this matches the observations of co emission and dust extinction ( figure [ cofig ] , [ dustfig ] ) .",
    "a similar trend is also seen in the barred spiral ngc  1530 ( see figure 2.10 in regan et al .",
    "1995 , or figure 11 in downes et al 1996 ) .    in summary",
    ", the hydrodynamic model reproduces the observed offset dust lanes and the observed increase in gas density inwards along the dust lane .",
    "but there are key differences between the model and the observations .",
    "the model predicts a nuclear ring morphology with an extremely high density contrast between the ring and the dust lanes , whereas observations show a s - shaped morphology with three peaks with a relatively low density contrast between the dust lanes and the peaks .",
    "one reason for the absence of the predicted morphology could be the presence of a nuclear bar which could drive gas inwards from the twin peaks .",
    "we searched for a nuclear bar in a high resolution , high dynamic range nicmos image ( figure [ nicfig]a ) .",
    "the image shows a relatively smooth nucleus with a collection of star forming regions north northwest of the nucleus .",
    "these correspond to the peak hp seen in the lower resolution image ( figure [ hafig ] ) .",
    "the main bar dust lane can also be seen in absorption as it travels inwards towards the nucleus .",
    "there is no evidence of a nuclear bar at the center of ngc  5383 .",
    "since the nucleus in ngc  5383 is quite bright , it is possible that weaker structure in this region may be difficult to discern . to investigate this possibility we applied the technique of unsharp masking where we subtracted a 14 pixel fwhm gaussian smoothed image ( figure [ nicfig]b ) from the original image ( figure [ nicfig]a ) .",
    "pioneered by malin & zealey ( 1979 ) , this technique allows one to distinguish weaker features from brighter ones by reducing the contribution of the bright background ; however , we caution that the unsharp masking technique is not perfect and detailed studies of nuclear structure may benefit from multiple techniques . for our purposes",
    "the unsharp masking technique is adequate ; the resulting image is shown in figure [ nicfig ] .",
    "it shows a well - defined two arm , trailing spiral pattern which starts from the main northwestern dust lane and winds its way down to an unresolved core ; there is no evidence of a nuclear bar .",
    "the observed trailing pattern is not unique to ngc  5383 ; central regions of other galaxies also show similar nuclear trailing spirals ( e.g. ngc  3982 , ngc  3032 , mkn 573 regan & mulchaey 1999 and references therein ) . this trailing spiral arm pattern may be a mechanism for transporting gas further inwards from the location of the inner lindblad resonance ( regan & mulchaey 1999 ) where the gas inflow is known to stall in modeling studies .",
    "models have not predicted this trailing spiral pattern .",
    "analytic solutions predict a leading spiral structure inside the inner inner lindblad resonance ( iilr ) ( combes 1996 ; yuan & kuo 1997 ) .",
    "although a trailing spiral pattern can be excited at the outer inner lindblad resonance ( oilr ) , only a leading spiral is excited by the iilr .",
    "it is unclear whether the oilr excited trailing spiral pattern can propogate inside the iilr .",
    "it is also unclear how the two spiral patterns interact and whether the relative amplitudes of the two patterns can appropriately account for these observations .",
    "these issues are under investigation ( yuan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the smoothed image used for the unsharp masking ( lower right hand corner in figure [ nicfig ] ) has a resolution and quality comparable to good ground - based images . in this image",
    ", we clearly see a nuclear bar - like feature at the center of ngc  5383 even though there is no bar in the original nicmos image and in the unsharped masked image .",
    "the bar - like feature is created by the smoothing of the light from the bright star forming regions north and south of the nucleus which leads to the roughly north - south elongation , i.e. the fake bar . smoothing the original image with a gaussian with fwhm of 7 pixels",
    ", one can even create a partial circumnuclear ring ( see figure [ nicfig]d ) .",
    "although this is more difficult to see than the bar , an oval encircling the fake nuclear bar is clearly visible in this image . in reality , these structures are simply artifacts of the various smoothing techniques applied to the original image .",
    "this result shows that study of the nuclear structures in a galaxy requires high resolution observations , and that ground - based images can be inadequate and worse , misleading in the identification of these structures .",
    "another important point of note is that even in the h - band , where the effects of dust extinction and star formation are supposed to be minimized , these nicmos images clearly show star forming knots and dust features .",
    "the smoothing experiments show how these contaminants can create false features .",
    "so although near - infrared observations are desirable compared to optical observations ( which are even more sensitive to these contaminants ) , the near - ir data also need to have high resolution to properly investigate nuclear features .",
    "thus , we conclude from this study of the nicmos image of the center of ngc  5383 that a nuclear bar is not responsible for the differences between the observations and the model predictions .",
    "we considered the possibility that the hydrodynamic models could produce offset dust lanes without producing a nuclear ring .",
    "the motivation for this search came from an examination of the bi - modal outcomes ( i.e. offset dust lanes with a ring versus centered dust lanes without a ring ) of the previous studies by a92 and pst95 . since these studies took rather coarse steps in parameter space , we considered the possibility of an intermediate scenario where offset dust lanes could exist without a ring or with some other nuclear gas morphology .",
    "we studied the parameter space by varying three of the four free parameters in the pst95 model ( the four parameters are the bar axial ratio , the central density , the lagrangian radius or equivalently the pattern speed , and the quadrupole moment or equivalently the bar mass @xmath32 see pst95 for details ) in such a way as to encompass the transition region between the two outcomes described above .",
    "though we found some new and interesting results from this experiment ( see appendix a ) , we did not find the intermediate scenario we were searching for ; in every case where offset dust lanes formed , we found that a nuclear ring also formed ( see figure [ modfig]a , b , c ) .",
    "hence , we come to the conclusion that gas hydrodynamic processes alone can not determine the nuclear region gas morphology .      initial parameters and the length of time over which the bar has evolved both determine the density of the ring in the model .",
    "since in the pst95 model the inflowing gas simply accretes in the nuclear ring over time , the density contrast between the ring and the dust lanes is destined to increase over time .",
    "the low density contrast in the observations of ngc  5383 might suggest that the bar in this galaxy is fairly young .",
    "however , similar low gas density contrast in several other barred spirals indicates that it is more likely that the gas is somehow being depleted from the ring .",
    "one way of depleting the gas would be to convert the gas into stars .",
    "kenney et al . ( 1993 ) showed that in the nuclear region of ngc  3504 , the toomre q parameter is close to its critical value ; they suggested that the ongoing nuclear star formation could be explained using a simple gravitational instability picture .",
    "elmegreen ( 1994 ) also showed analytically that at typical nuclear ring radii ( r @xmath1 1 kpc ) , star formation can occur via gravitational instability if the ring gas density is roughly 100 @xmath16 disk gas density ( at r @xmath1 10 kpc ) , assuming that the disk gas density is nearly critical . in the models ,",
    "the ring density is a factor of 50 - 200 @xmath16 initial disk density which is sufficiently high for star formation via gravitational collapse . indeed , in the nuclear region in ngc  5383 ( figure [ hafig ] ) , as in numerous other barred spirals ( phillips 1993 ; garcia - barreto et al .",
    "1996 ) , we observe vigorous , circumnuclear , massive star formation .",
    "the nuclear star formation rate in ngc  5383 is at least 7   (  [ starform ] ) .",
    "if continuous star formation is assumed , this rate sets a lower limit on the mass inflow rate .",
    "based on measurements in other barred spirals such as ngc  7479 and ngc  1530 , which are similar to ngc  5383 , it is likely that the mass inflow rate is lower ( quillen et al .",
    "1995 and rvt97 measure inflow rates of 14  ) .",
    "but the mass inflow rate is a difficult quantity to measure and these numbers are highly uncertain .",
    "still it is unlikely that the high nuclear star formation activity can be supported by a proportionally high mass inflow rate over an extended period of time ( for example , an inflow rate of 10  , would deplete the total gas reserve ( 10@xmath33 ) of a typical galactic disk in only a billion years ) .",
    "one can also compare the total gas mass in the center of ngc 5383 to the current star formation rate . using the standard co - h@xmath27 conversion factor ,",
    "the total molecular gas mass in the center of ngc 5383 is 2@xmath1610@xmath31 .",
    "given that the dust and the co intensities differ between the bar and the nuclear region , and given that the dust is probably a better tracer of the molecular gas mass , the total molecular gas mass calculated from the standard conversion factor is probably an upper limit to the total gas mass in the circumnuclear region .",
    "therefore at the observed star formation rate of 7  , the gas reservoir at the center of ngc 5383 can be depleted in less than 3@xmath1610@xmath34 yrs .",
    "so , as has been suggested before , circumnuclear star formation in ngc 5383 is probably an intense and episodic event ( shlosman 1992 ) .",
    "thus the observed low density contrast can be attributed to gas depletion via circumnuclear star formation .",
    "the simulations do not reproduce the observations because , although star formation can occur at the model densities , star formation is not modeled .",
    "we used the luminosity to estimate the star formation rate in various regions in ngc  5383 ( see table [ sfrtab ] ) .",
    "we measure an flux of 2.42 @xmath8 0.09 @xmath16 10@xmath35   in the central 3.5 kpc diameter region and a total flux in the galaxy of 4.37 @xmath8 0.36 @xmath16 10@xmath35 .",
    "we converted the observed flux to a star formation rate using the empirical equation derived by kennicutt ( 1983 ) , @xmath36 in deriving this equation kennicutt assumed an average intrinsic dust extinction of 1.1 magnitudes in a galaxy . since the dust extinction can vary dramatically in star forming regions ( phillips 1993 ) , the exact optical depth is difficult to determine ; hence , we use kennicutt s value to correct the observed fluxes for dust extinction . using an adopted distance of 32.4 mpc",
    ", we calculate the total star formation rate in ngc  5383 to be 12.6  , of which 7  , are formed in the nuclear region . for any single galaxy ,",
    "this type of calculation of the star formation rate is uncertain by a factor of 2 ( kennicutt 1983 ) .",
    "a previous calculation using a different technique and the h@xmath37 ionization line by duval & athanassoula ( 1983 ) resulted in a nuclear star formation rate of 8 ; our results are consistent with their value .",
    "the star formation rate at the northeastern and southwestern bar ends is 1.9 & 3.2  , respectively , smaller than the star formation rate in the nuclear region .",
    "lrrrr h - i & nuclear region & 1074 & 2.42 @xmath8 0.085 @xmath16 10@xmath35 & 7",
    "h - ii & ne bar end region & 1026 & 0.65 @xmath8 0.07 @xmath16 10@xmath35 & 1.9",

    "however , such a high star formation rate is not unusual for centers of barred spirals , and such activity is often classified as a starburst ( e.g. , jogee 1999 ; contini et al .",
    "the total mass of h@xmath27 ( 2 @xmath16 10@xmath31 ) calculated earlier is also not unusual and it places ngc  5383 in company of galaxies such as ngc  4536 and ngc  2782 ( jogee 1999 ) which are both gas rich in the nuclear region and hosts to high nuclear star formation activity .",
    "excluding the bar ends and the nuclear regions , early type barred spirals have very low star formation activity in the bar , even though the gas concentration is high in the bar dust lanes ( downes et al .",
    "1996 ) . as already shown in  [ hydromorph ] , the density contrast between the dust lanes and the center is small . yet",
    "the star formation activity in the bar is limited compared to the center ; several explanations have been put forth to account for this behavior .",
    "tubbs ( 1982 ) suggested that molecular clouds entering the dust lane could be dispersed due to their high velocities relative to dust lane gas .",
    "athanassoula ( 1992 ) argued that the high shear in the bar dust lanes prevents star formation .",
    "rvt97 pointed to the large divergence in gas streamlines prior to the dust lanes , which they argued could tear apart molecular clouds or prevent their formation . recently",
    ", reynaud & downes ( 1998 ) argued that a combination of the shear and shock in the dust lanes leads to the low star formation rate in the bar .",
    "these hypotheses argue effectively for the inhibition of star formation in the bar dust lanes . yet",
    "some star formation does occur in the bar . here",
    "we investigate precisely where and under what circumstances stars form in the bar .",
    "the star formation sites can be traced by emission , whereas the molecular gas can be traced by either co emission or dust extinction .",
    "the co emission in the bar dust lanes of ngc  5383 is too weak to be detected , so we assume that the dust extinction traces the molecular gas ( as suggested observations of ngc  1530 by downes et al .",
    "1996 and observations of ngc  3627 and ngc  2903 by rsv99 ) .",
    "figure [ hadust ] shows the overlay of the emission on the dust extinction in the bar on ngc  5383 . comparing the relative distribution of the star formation sites to the molecular gas distribution in this figure ,",
    "one immediately notices two important features .",
    "first , the peaks are all located on the leading side of the bar dust lane .",
    "second , these peaks occur preferentially near dust concentrations ( see arrows in figure [ hadust ] ) ; these peaks are found at the ends of dust spurs which are most clearly seen in the r@xmath32k@xmath19 ( figure [ dustfig ] ) image . the peaks and the dust peaks are roughly @xmath1 3@xmath13 , or @xmath1 470 pc apart .    in order to place these observations in the context of the hydrodynamic model gas kinematics , we reiterate the predictions of the gas flow in the models",
    "in these models , gas flows in elliptical streamlines until it encounters the main bar dust lane where the hydrodynamic shock redirects the gas inwards ( rvt97 ; rsv99 ) ; _ none _ of the gas encountering the dust lane crosses the dust lane .",
    "hence , the presence of emission on the leading side of the dust lane is surprising .",
    "this is because the recent massive star formation indicated by the emission is thought to occur only in areas of high gas concentration such as giant molecular clouds , or in larger complexes of such clouds called giant molecular associations ( blitz 1994 and references therein ; vogel , kulkarni & scoville 1988 ) ; the area on the leading side of the bar dust lane does not have high gas concentrations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these young stars must have formed elsewhere .    in the bar ,",
    "the only regions suitable for star formation , i.e. regions of high gas concentrations , are the dust lanes and the dust spurs .",
    "the dust lane , however , is thought to be an inhospitable environment for various reasons already outlined above ; the spurs are a plausible alternative .",
    "since there is a one to one correspondence between the peaks and the dust spurs with the peaks located directly across from the spurs , it is likely that the spurs are involved in star formation . in context of the hydrodynamic gas flow , stars forming in the spurs would continue to move along their original elliptical orbits .",
    "these stars would pass ballistically through the dust lane , travel to the leading side and ionize the low density gas there .",
    "this would be consistent with the peaks being located directly across from the dust spurs .",
    "another important reason for the spurs to be conducive to star formation is that , in addition to being regions of high gas density , the spurs are also located in a region of lower shear .",
    "although we do not have a full velocity field map for ngc 5383 which shows the lower shear environment , the lower shear can be clearly seen in the gas , prior to its encounter with the dust lanes , in the maps of other barred galaxies such as ngc  1530 ( rvt97 ) .",
    "the distance between the peaks and the dust concentrations at the end of the spurs puts a strong constraint on the velocity of the newly formed stars .",
    "if the stars form in the spurs , the stars must traverse @xmath1500 pc in 10@xmath38 years and therefore have velocities @xmath1 50  ( in the rotating frame of the bar ) ; indeed , velocities of this magnitude are present in the hydrodynamic model before the gas encounters the dust lane .",
    "so the distance between the peaks and the dust lanes is also consistent with star formation occurring in the spurs .",
    "thus we have addressed where and under what circumstances stars form in the bar , given the predictions of the hydrodynamic model gas flow .",
    "the observations presented here suggest the following scenario : at certain locations along the bar gas becomes highly concentrated and forms spurs .",
    "star formation occurs in the spurs because of the high gas density _ and _ low shear .",
    "the newly formed stars move ballistically through the dust lane , ionizing the low density gas on the leading side of the bar and appearing directly across from the spurs , whereas the gas is redirected inwards down the dust lane .    however , one difficulty in applying this scenario to ngc  5383 is the lack of emission in the spurs .",
    "the spurs are simply not dense enough to hide star formation and therefore one might expect to see emission from ongoing star formation in the spurs",
    ". the lack of such emission in ngc  5383 may be because we are observing very low levels star formation activity ( 2 - 3 peaks on each side ) in the bar of this galaxy .",
    "indeed , observations of other galaxies do show emission on both the leading and trailing sides of the bar dust lane ( e.g. , as in ngc 7479 , laine et al .",
    "1999 ) ; however , it is not known whether this emission is associated with dust spurs . in any case , the one - to - one correspondence between the emission and the spurs in ngc  5383 is unlikely to be completely coincidental and therefore it is highly likely that the spurs are involved in the star formation activity .",
    "another interesting aspect of this scenario is that it points out the need for including gas self - gravity in the hydrodynamic model .",
    "the presence of the spurs clearly indicates that gas is becoming highly concentrated along the bar . in the region of the spurs",
    ", the divergent gas streamlines should prevent cloud formation ( as pointed out by rvt97 ) but the presence of the spurs shows the importance of cloud self - gravity and cloud - cloud gravitational interactions .",
    "these effects are not modeled by the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "so although these models are highly successful at reproducing the velocity fields and the straight dust lane morphology in bars , and they provide an adequate context for interpreting the observations of emission and the spurs in the bar , these models lack the self - consistency necessary to fully explain the star formation process .",
    "the nuclear gas and dust distribution in the prototypical barred spiral ngc  5383 can not be reproduced by the hydrodynamic models . whereas the model always produces a high density contrast circumnuclear ring , the gas and dust",
    "are observed in a low density contrast s - shaped distribution .",
    "we have shown that the discrepancy can not be eliminated by fine tuning the model .",
    "the alternative possibility that a nuclear bar is responsible for the differences is eliminated by using a high resolution nicmos image . applying the unsharp masking technique , we find that the underlying nuclear structure is a trailing spiral pattern . we have also shown how coarser resolution data , such as that found in ground ",
    "based images , can lead to false identifications of nuclear bars and rings .",
    "we conclude that the discrepancy between the observed and modeled gas distribution is due to the absence of star formation in the models ; the vigorous 7  circumnuclear star formation , which can deplete the gas and lead to the observed low density contrast , is not modeled by the hydrodynamic simulations .    finally , we present an explanation for how stars may form in the bar between the bar ends and the circumnuclear region . in our scenario ,",
    "stars form in dust spurs before the gas encounters the dust lane .",
    "the spurs , unlike the high shear / high density dust lane , are more conducive to star formation because they are regions of low shear and high density .",
    "stars which form in the spurs travel ballistically through the hydrodynamic shock at the dust lane , ionizing the low density gas on the leading side of the dust lane , whereas the gas is redirected down the dust lane .",
    "thus , hii regions can even be found on the leading side of the main bar dust lanes .",

    "the gravitational potential used in this model consists of a kuzmin - toomre disk , a bulge and a bar described by a ferrer s ellipsoid .",
    "the model is completely determined by four independent input parameters : the bar axial ratio ( a / b ) , the central density ( @xmath39 , 10@xmath40 kpc@xmath41 ) , the lagrangian radius ( r@xmath42 , kpc , equivalently the pattern speed ) , and the quadrupole moment ( q@xmath43 , 10@xmath40 kpc@xmath44 , equivalently the bar mass ) ( see pst95 for details ) . we chose to set a / b = 4.0 and varied the other three parameters as follows : 1.0e4 @xmath18 @xmath39 @xmath18 7.4e4 , 5.0 @xmath18 r@xmath42 @xmath18 7.5 , 1.5e4 @xmath18 q@xmath43 @xmath18 7.5e4 . since any of these three free parameters can affect the transition between the two outcomes of the model , we varied one parameter at a time while setting the other two parameters to the `` standard '' model values used by pst95 .",

    "we find that the formation of the ring is indeed abrupt in all instances where an ilr exists .",

    "although this experiment failed in finding the intermediate scenario which may have explained the observations of ngc  5383 , we discovered other interesting results which add to our current understanding of gas distribution in the hydrodynamic models .",
    "first , when the ring exists , we find that the ring seems to be located at approximately the same distance and has approximately the same thickness growing only slightly thinner with higher central density concentration .",
    "since the commonly accepted explanation for the location of the nuclear ring is that it must exist between the outer ilr ( oilr ) and the inner ilr ( iilr ) , one can conclude that the ring location and thickness should be restricted to a certain range of radii .",
    "we find that in all 21 model runs ( table [ models ] ) which produce a ring , the ring peak is always located between the oilr and the iilr as shown in figure [ ilrs ] .",
    "interestingly , we also find that the location of the ring peak does not coincide with the location of the @xmath45-@xmath46/2 maximum ( figure [ ilrs ] ) as suggested by pst95 except for the standard model . in most cases",
    "the ring peak is close to the maximum of the @xmath45-@xmath46/2 curve , but its location seems to be determined by the location of the oilr for a given model . in other words the location of the ring peak and",

    "; at these distance , the gas is no longer on circular orbits and hence the classical definition of an oilr may not be relevant .",

    "<S> we have mapped the barred spiral ngc 5383 using the bima millimeter - wave array for observations of co ( j=10 ) , the palomar 1.5 m for h@xmath0  and optical broadband , and the kitt peak 1.3 m for near - ir broadband . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observed central gas and dust morphology to the predictions of recent hydrodynamic simulations calculated using the piner , stone , and teuben code . in the nuclear region , </S>",
    "<S> our observations reveal three peaks lying along a s - shaped gas and dust distribution : two of these are at the inner end of offset bar dust lanes at the presumed location of the inner lindblad resonance , and the other lies closer to the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the model predicts a circumnuclear ring , not the observed s - shaped distribution ; moreover , the predicted surface density contrast between the central gas accumulation and the bar dust lanes is an order of magnitude larger than observed .    </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies remain for all our simulations which produce offset bar dust lanes , and indicate that the model is missing an essential process or component . </S>",
    "<S> a small nuclear bar might account for the discrepancy , but we rule this out using a hst nicmos ] introduction ------------    barred spirals constitute a large fraction of all disk galaxies ( @xmath1 75% according to a near - ir survey by mulchaey , regan & kundu 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non - axisymmetry of a bar potential induces gas inflow which can lead to a number of dramatic evolutionary changes in a galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> 130@xmath84@xmath9 & ( 1 )    though a majority of these effects depend on the gas inflow , there is no consensus on the exact mechanism for the inflow . </S>",
    "<S> there are at least two classes of models : cloud - based / sticky particle simulations which treat the gas as a collection of discrete particles subject to `` sticky '' collisions ( combes & gerin 1985 ) and hydrodynamic simulations which treat gas as an ideal fluid ( athanassoula 1992b and references therein ; piner , stone & teuben 1995 , hereafter pst95 ) . </S>",
    "<S> both models form dust lanes along the leading edge of the bar , have mass inflow , and form circumnuclear rings ( combes & gerin 1985 ; pst95 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic models have been remarkably successful in explaining the shapes of the main bar dust lanes , the shock signature at the location of the dust lane ( athanassoula 1992 ) , and the overall gas kinematics in the bar ( rvt97 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we use the framework provided by this class of models to ask two important questions : can the nuclear gas and dust morphology in bars be explained by these models ? and can the gas flow predicted by these models provide a basis for explaining the star formation activity in the bar ?    to answer these questions , we use a multi - wavelength dataset for the barred spiral ngc 5383 ; the dataset includes maps of millimeter wave co ( j=10 ) emission to trace the molecular gas , emission to trace the ionized component , and broad - band optical and near - ir emission to trace the stellar distribution and dust extinction . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  5383 is a prototypical early hubble type ( sbb ) barred spiral galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the global characteristics of ngc  5383 are summarized in table [ global ] . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  5383 has been studied with optical images ( burbidge , burbidge & prendergast 1962 ; duval & athanassoula 1983 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) , long - slit spectra ( peterson et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1978 ; duval & athanassoula , 1983 ) , hi interferometric observations ( sancisi , allen & sullivan 1979 ) , and single - dish co observations ( ohta , sasaki & saito 1986 ) . the standard model for some of the seminal studies of gas flow in barred spirals has also used ngc  5383 as the prototype ( huntley 1978 ; sanders and tubbs 1980 ; tubbs 1982 ; duval & athanassoula 1983 ; a92 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we first present a comparison of nuclear gas and dust morphology in ngc  5383 to the model predictions in  [ hydromorph ] . </S>",
    "<S> the gas and dust distribution is a signature of the bar induced inflow and its subsequent evolution . </S>",
    "<S> if the hydrodynamic model can reproduce the observations , then it may be used as an adequate model for studying gas flow in the nuclear region of bars . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> even a failure of the model can refine our understanding by pointing out missing physics in the model s assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that while the model is consistent with the observations in some aspects , there are several striking differences between the two . </S>",
    "<S> possible reasons for these discrepancies are investigated in  [ understand ] where we consider presence of a nuclear bar , incomplete parameter space exploration of the model , or lack of star formation processes in the model . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the latter is at least partly responsible for the discrepancies .    in  [ stardust ] </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the sites of star formation with the molecular gas distribution in the bar and investigate where and under what circumstances stars form in the bar . </S>",
    "<S> this is important because bar star formation can affect the net mass inflow . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is novel because previous studies ( tubbs 1982 ; athanassoula 1992b ; reynaud & downes 1998 ) have only sought to explain the lack of bar star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first explanation of how stars may be forming in the bar , between the bar ends and the circumnuclear region . </S>"
