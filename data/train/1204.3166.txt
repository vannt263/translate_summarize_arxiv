    "one of the striking features in high-@xmath15 cuprates is an unusual impurity effect on the superconductivity , which has been studied extensively from experimental and theoretical points of view to elucidate the mechanism for high-@xmath15 superconductivity .",
    "as is well known , in conventional superconductors , whose superconducting ( sc ) order parameter is of the @xmath21-wave type , magnetic impurities strongly suppress @xmath15@xcite , whereas nonmagnetic ones do little@xcite . however , this is not the case for the impurity effect on high-@xmath15 superconductivity , whose order parameter is of the @xmath14-wave type . in high-@xmath15 cuprates ,",
    "a small number of in - plane impurities , such as nonmagnetic zn or magnetic ni impurities , which are partially substituted for cu sites within cuo@xmath22 planes , cause a large reduction of @xmath15 and a large increase of the residual density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath23 ) , whether they are magnetic or not.@xcite more interestingly , it has been demonstrated in @xmath24 ( lsco ) that a nonmagnetic zn impurity exhibits a stronger effect on the high-@xmath15 superconductivity than a magnetic ni impurity ; in particular , the recovery of the residual dos(@xmath23 ) is much more evident for the former impurity.@xcite the large recovery of the residual dos(@xmath23 ) due to a small amount of zn impurity has been explained well in terms of a model in which the sc gap is completely suppressed locally in areas with a diameter on the order of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlation length around the zn impurity , where the af correlation among cu spins is disturbed because there are no localized spins on the impurity sites.@xcite however , such a model gives no explanation for the large suppression of @xmath15 in the sc region outside the magnetically disturbed areas around zn impurities .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity in ni - doped lsco has not been clarified yet .",
    "it has been demonstrated in measurements of the @xmath6 dependence of magnetic susceptibility in pure and ni - doped lsco that a small amount of ni impurity , which has a localized spin , has little effect on the af correlation among cu - spins , as in the sc region outside the non - sc areas around zn impurities.@xcite therefore , the suppression of superconductivity in ni - doped lsco is expected to occur rather uniformly over the whole crystal , which is much simpler than that in zn - doped lsco .    in @xmath14-wave superconductors",
    ", it has been broadly thought that the presence of impurities gives rise to pair breaking in the vicinity of the nodes and leads to collapse of the sc gap there.@xcite however , in our recent study on the low - temperature ( @xmath6@xmath16@xmath15 ) electronic specific heat of ni - doped lsco , we pointed out that the sc gap around the nodes will be affected only slightly by a small amount of ni impurity.@xcite furthermore , recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments on @xmath25 ( @xmath26-bi2201 , @xmath26 : rare earth element ) reported that as interplane disorders , which are caused by the substitution of @xmath26 atoms for sr sites , are strengthened by replacing the @xmath26 atom la with eu , the @xmath15 is reduced from 33 k to 18 k at the optimal doping level , but the sc gap dispersion around the nodes remains almost unchanged .",
    "the suppression of superconductivity in eu - bi2201 has been discussed in terms of the shrinkage of a nodal part of the fermi surface ( fs ) , the so - called `` fermi arc '' , which consists of coherent electronic states and is responsible for an effective sc gap in determining @xmath15.@xcite on the other hand , it has been claimed in arpes experiments on @xmath27 ( @xmath28-bi2212 , @xmath28=ni or zn ) that the sc gap is collapsed in the vicinity of the nodes .",
    "however , its region around the nodes is only @xmath292% of the whole fs , corresponding to the region whose original gap size is smaller than @xmath291 mev , which would be too small to explain the observed reduction of @xmath15 ( @xmath30=5@xmath1710 k).@xcite thus , in high-@xmath15 cuprates , the impurity or disorder effect on the sc gap is still under debate even for the nodal region .",
    "one of the good ways to investigate the sc gap around the nodes in @xmath14-wave superconductors is to measure the electronic specific heat @xmath0 in the sc mixed state induced by the application of magnetic field @xmath8 along the lines of nodes . in the mixed state , the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath4 ( @xmath18@xmath13 ) at @xmath6=0 k , the residual @xmath4 value , @xmath7 , reflecting the residual dos(@xmath23 ) , increases with the increase of @xmath8 .",
    "this is because the residual dos(@xmath23 ) recovers in areas extending along the node directions from vortex cores , which is due to the doppler shift of the quasiparticle dispersion curve .",
    "the increment of @xmath7 , @xmath10 , follows the volovik relation , @xmath10=@xmath11 , where prefactor @xmath12 is inversely proportional to the slope @xmath31 of the gap dispersion around the nodes.@xcite the volovik relation has been confirmed in pure samples of @xmath32@xcite and lsco@xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the ni - impurity effect on the sc gap was examined from measurements of the electronic specific heat @xmath0 at @xmath6@xmath16@xmath15 under magnetic fields for @xmath1 ( lscno ) samples .",
    "first , we report that the residual @xmath4 value ( @xmath18@xmath13 ) at @xmath6=0 k , @xmath7 , increases under magnetic fields , following the volovik relation , in lscno as well as in pure samples .",
    "next we report that the sc part of @xmath13 , @xmath33@xmath17@xmath34@xmath18@xmath35 , under @xmath8=0 shows a sc anomaly exhibiting an abrupt increase at @xmath15 and @xmath6-linear dependence at @xmath6@xmath16@xmath15 , although the sc anomaly is largely suppressed as a whole with increases in ni - concentration @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 is reduced in proporion to the suppression of @xmath35 in lscno . on the basis of these observations ,",
    "we propose a scenario in which the sc gap of lscno will be predominantly suppressed not in the vicinity of the nodes but at the edges of the coherent nodal fs . such ni - impurity pair breaking leads to natural explanations for the marked suppression of @xmath15 and the sc condensation energy @xmath20 , evaluated from the data of @xmath35 , in lscno .",
    "specific heat measurements at low temperatures ( @xmath6@xmath3610 k ) under magnetic fields , whose directions were perpendicular to cuo@xmath22 planes , that is , along the @xmath9-axis , were carried out by a thermal relaxation method in single crystal samples of lscno . on the other hand , specific heat measurements in a wide @xmath6 range from 4 k to 60 k , sufficiently higher than @xmath15 , under a zero magnetic field were carried out by a conventional heat - pulse technique on ceramic samples of lscno . the way to determine",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the phonon term @xmath37 in a wide @xmath6 range is one of the important keys to extracting the change of @xmath38 in accordance with the sc transition from the total specific heat @xmath39 , including both the @xmath38 and @xmath37 terms .",
    "the partial ni substitution for cu sites makes it possible to determine the phonon term @xmath37 of the sc samples .",
    "this is because a small amount of ni substitution can destroy the superconductivity completely but has little effect on the phonon term , at least , in the optimal samples.@xcite this ni substitution effect is in sharp contrast with zn substitution , which modifies the phonon term significantly . in the present study",
    ", we obtained the electronic term @xmath38 by subtracting the phonon term @xmath40 , which was estimated in a ni - doped non - sc sample , from the observed , total specific heat @xmath39 ; @xmath38=@xmath39@xmath17@xmath40 .",
    "details of the estimations of @xmath40 and/or @xmath38 have been published elsewhere.@xcite    ceramic and single - crystal samples of lscno were prepared by using la@xmath22o@xmath41 , srco@xmath41 , cuo , and nio powders of 99.99 - 99.999% purity . for the ceramic samples , these powders were mixed well and then heat - treated in a furnace at a certain temperature under flowing oxygen .",
    "the heat - treated materials were reground well and pressed into pellets , and were sintered in flowing oxygen .",
    "the single crystal samples were grown by the traveling solvent floating zone method . for these ceramic and single crystal samples ,",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat @xmath0 have been systematically investigated in @xmath1 ( lscno ) in order to study ni - impurity effects on the superconducting ( sc ) gap . in lscno with @xmath2=0.15 and @xmath3=0.015 , the value of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) at @xmath6=0 k , @xmath7 , is enhanced under the magnetic field @xmath8 applied along the @xmath9-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the increment of @xmath7 , @xmath10 , follows the volovik relation @xmath10=@xmath11 , characteristic of the sc gap with line nodes , with prefactor @xmath12 similar to that of a pure sample . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 vs. @xmath6 curve under @xmath8=0 shows a @xmath14-wave - like sc anomaly with an abrupt increase at @xmath15 and @xmath6-linear dependence at @xmath6@xmath16@xmath15 , although the @xmath7-value in the @xmath13 vs. @xmath6 curve increases with increasing ni concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as the sc part of @xmath13 , @xmath13@xmath17@xmath7@xmath18@xmath19 , decreases in lscno , @xmath15 is reduced in proportion to the decrease of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings can be explained phenomenologically by a simple model in which ni impurities bring about strong pair breaking at the edges of the coherent nodal part of the fermi surface but in the vicinity of the nodes of the sc gap . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the sc condensation energy @xmath20 in lscno , evaluated from @xmath0 at @xmath6@xmath15 , is also understood by the same model . </S>"
