    "located at a distance of only @xmath3 kpc ( mateo 1998 ) , ngc6822 is , apart from the lmc / smc system , the most nearby dwarf irregular galaxy known .",
    "discovered by barnard ( 1884 ) , its strong resemblance to the lmc / smc led perrine ( 1922 ) to speculate that `` barnard s nebula '' might be an object located outside our galaxy .",
    "this was confirmed by hubble ( 1925 ) who determined its distance using cepheid measurements , making it `` the first object definitely assigned to a region outside the galactic system . ''    ngc6822 has no known companions and is not associated with the concentrations of galaxies surrounding m31 and the milky way ( see e.g.  van den bergh 1999 ) ; rather it belongs to the `` local group cloud '' , an extended cloud of dwarf irregulars ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "ngc  6822 has a total luminosity of @xmath4 ( hodge et al .",
    "1991 ) and a total hi mass of @xmath5 ( de blok & walter 2000 ) , making it relatively gas - rich .",
    "it is a metal poor galaxy , with an ism abundance of about 0.2 @xmath6 ( e.g. skillman 1989 ) .",
    "it has a low star formation rate of @xmath7 ( based on h@xmath8 and fir fluxes ; mateo 1998 , israel et al.1996 ) . in terms of these global properties",
    "ngc 6822 is a rather average and quiescent dwarf irregular galaxy . in the past little attention has been paid to the distribution of the neutral ism of ngc 6822 .",
    "this can partly be attributed to the fact that part of the hi emission of ngc6822 is at the same heliocentric velocity as strong foreground emission from our milky way .",
    "this `` galactic interference '' is hard to remove if only a coarse velocity resolution is employed , as was the case in the early hi studies .",
    "this confusion , as well as ngc6822 s large size , may be the reasons why to date only few hi  studies of this galaxy have appeared in the literature , even though its inclination , gas - richness and proximity make it an ideal candidate for studying the rotation curve , dark matter content and relation between the stellar population and gaseous ism .",
    "the earliest hi  study of ngc6822 is that by volders & hgbom ( 1961 ) who used the 25 m dwingeloo telescope to probe ngc6822 and its environs .",
    "they found evidence for neutral hydrogen rotating in ordered fashion around the optical center .",
    "later studies by davies ( 1970 ) and roberts ( 1970 ) , confirmed these results .",
    "follow - up interferometric studies by gottesman & weliachew ( 1977 ) and brandenburg & skillman ( 1998 ) ( see also hodge et al .",
    "1991 ) showed a structured and extended ism in and around the optical galaxy .",
    "here , we present the first results of a large project to map the entire hi disk of ngc  6822 in unprecedented detail .",
    "we used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in mosaicing mode and the parkes single dish telescope , mapping an area of @xmath9 ( @xmath10  kpc ) .",
    "a preliminary inspection of the data showed that , contrary to expectations ( based on the low sfr and its isolated position in the local group ) , the hi appearance is dramatic : it is dominated by a giant hi shell with extended , apparently tidal , features in the outer disk .",
    "this disturbed hi morphology and how it affects our view of the evolution of ngc 6822 is the subject of this letter .",
    "ngc6822 has been observed with the australia telescope compact array for @xmath11 hours in its 375 , 750d , 1.5a , 6a and 6d configurations over the period from june 1999 to march 2000 .",
    "a total of 8 pointings was observed covering the entire hi extent of the galaxy .",
    "we used a bandwidth of 4 mhz with a channel separation of 0.8 @xmath12 .",
    "additionally , ngc 6822 was observed with the parkes single dish radio telescope using the multibeam receiver in december 1998 .",
    "a full account of the observations will be presented elsewhere ( de  blok & walter , in prep . ) . in this letter",
    "we restrict ourselves to the medium resolution data which does not include the 6-km configuration , nor the single dish data .",
    "the data was reduced and mosaiced together using the miriad data reduction package .",
    "super - uniform weighting , reducing side lobes in individual pointings prior to mosaicing , was used .",
    "the resulting data cubes were cleaned with the miriad mossdi task . the clean synthesized beam of this medium resolution data set measures @xmath13 ( @xmath14 pc ) .",
    "the noise per channel is 8 mjy , resulting in a @xmath15 column density sensitivity of @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "figure 1 shows the integrated hi column density map .",
    "the map was produced by using a two times smoothed and clipped ( @xmath18 ) version of the data as a mask . also shown is the same map overplotted on an optical dss image .",
    "the hi is more extended than the optical distribution , extending out to radii of 40 arcmin ( @xmath19 kpc ) .",
    "we find a total hi  mass of @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "a comparison with the single dish parkes hi  mass of @xmath22 @xmath21  shows that we are missing very little flux due to missing short spacings .",
    "the hi  disk contains many holes and shells .",
    "three striking features that are the subject of this letter are marked in fig .  1 : the hole and arm in the se , and the cloud in the nw .      in the se a giant hi hole or",
    "shell dominates the appearance of the galaxy .",
    "its angular size size is @xmath23 ( as indicated in fig .  1 ) , corresponding to @xmath0 kpc , measured at a column density level of @xmath24 @xmath17 .",
    "we will adopt a mean diameter of 1.7 kpc .",
    "the deviation from a ( deprojected ) circle can probably be explained by shear in the outer disk of ngc6822 since the rotation curve flattens at large radii ( de blok & walter , in prep . ) .",
    "the giant hi shell is hinted at in earlier interferometer maps by gottesmann & weliachev ( 1977 ) of the centre of ngc 6822 and more clearly mapped in vla data presented in hodge et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and brandenburg & skillman ( 1998 ) . a major axis cut through the galaxy is shown in fig .  2",
    "note that the inner part of the hi hole seems to be completely evacuated .",
    "the hole does not seem to be expanding .",
    "the dispersion in this area ( @xmath25  @xmath12 ) is significantly lower than in the nw part of the galaxy ( @xmath26  @xmath12 ) where there are more signs of recent star formation ( fig .  2 , bottom ) .",
    "it is difficult to tell whether the hi complex in the extreme nw actually belongs to the main disk of ngc6822 or whether it is a companion at a similar heliocentric velocity .",
    "the hi mass of the nw complex is @xmath27 , i.e.  @xmath28 of the total hi mass of the total ngc  6822-system . at the ngc6822-cloud interface",
    "there is a sharp jump in velocity ( at @xmath29 in fig .",
    "2 ) which may indicate that it is indeed a separate system . in principle , the jump could have been created by an asymmetric blow - out due to star formation . however , the lack of stars , star - forming regions and the low dispersion ( fig .",
    "2 ) in that region make this unlikely .",
    "furthermore , the nw half contains 20% more hi than the se half ( a difference of @xmath30 ) , as measured with respect to a minor axis passing through the geometrical center . assuming that the disk of ngc 6822 is intrinsically symmetric , this asymmetry can be explained by assuming that the nw cloud ( with a mass of @xmath31 ) is a separate system contributing to the mass in the nw half .      a third , `` tidal arm '' feature is visible in the se .",
    "it is unlikely that it is a conventional spiral arm , due to the absence of star formation in this part of the galaxy , the absence of any spiral structure in the optical and the inner hi disk , and the overall asymmetric hi morphology . whether the material in this arm was stripped off ngc6822 s main disk or belonged to an interaction partner is difficult to tell based on our data .",
    "future numerical simulations may shed light on this situation .",
    "a search of a @xmath32 field surrounding ngc  6822 using hipass data did not yield unknown hi  companions .",
    "one important caveat is , however , that there is galactic and hvc emission present in this region of the sky between @xmath33 and @xmath34@xmath12 .",
    "this velocity range coincides with that of the se arm .",
    "possible companions of ngc6822 might be hidden in the strong galactic emission . as timescales for an interaction with a known local group galaxy",
    "are too large by an order of magnitude , another possibility is that the nw cloud is the interaction partner .",
    "an upper limit to the time scale for this encounter is of the order of half the rotation period at the radial distance of the cloud which is @xmath35 yr . a rough estimate for the timescale can also be derived from the tidal feature itself : the arm measures some @xmath36 or 2.8 kpc .",
    "an inspection of the @xmath37 diagram in fig .  2 suggests a relative velocity between arm and disk of 10 to 30 @xmath12 . using 20 @xmath12  we derive a kinematic age of @xmath38 yr ,",
    "but any number between 100 and 200 myr is probably reasonable .",
    "in the standard picture , hi shells and supershells are caused by the stellar winds of the most massive stars in a cluster as well as subsequent sn explosions ( for reviews see kulkarni & heiles 1988 , van der hulst 1996 and brinks & walter 1998 ) . at first glance",
    ", it seems unlikely that this caused the giant shell .",
    "it is located far off the optical center and the bulk of star formation .",
    "one would need one or more massive stellar clusters at large radii to create the hole .",
    "these clusters ought to have dispersed over the past 100 myr , as there is no sign of a young population at the current epoch .",
    "if the hole was indeed created by star formation , we can derive the energies and ages involved .",
    "since the hole does not expand any more and has presumably broken out , it is only possible to make order of magnitude estimates .",
    "if we assume that the expansion velocity of the hole has reached values similar to the dispersion of the ambient ism ( @xmath25@xmath12 ) , we derive a kinematic age of 130 myr .",
    "this is an upper limit for the actual age since the shell was presumably expanding more rapidly in the past .",
    "an age of around 100 million years is therefore reasonable . using chevalier s equation ( chevalier 1974 )",
    ", we derive an energy of @xmath2  erg needed to create the hi shell , equivalent to 100 type ii supernovae ( using @xmath39@xmath40 ) .",
    "it is not necessary that these supernovae go off at the same time , which would need a massive parent cluster .",
    "many sequential events can create a big hole by superposition .",
    "the kinetic energy of the hi shell is @xmath41erg .",
    "an estimate for the amount of gas removed from the hole @xmath42 can be made as follows .",
    "we estimate @xmath43 , the scale height of the disk , following puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . using @xmath44 and @xmath45 kpc ( de blok & walter , in prep . ) , we find @xmath46 kpc .",
    "this yields a total hi mass evacuated from the hole of @xmath47 .",
    "the infall of small high - velocity clouds has sometimes been invoked to explain the largest hi supershells in galaxies ( tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "observational evidence has been found in m101 ( van der hulst & sancisi 1988 ) .",
    "however , if the hole in ngc 6822 were indeed due to infall of a high - velocity cloud we would expect to see remnants near the hole or at least some kinematical signature  neither is obvious ( see the position velocity cut in fig .  2 ) .",
    "as briefly noted in the introduction , based on the luminosity , gas - richness , metallicity , sfr and other global properties , one would classify ngc6822 as a typical , quiescent dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "there was thus no reason to suspect that ngc 6822 might have such a disturbed hi disk .",
    "the hi data presented here change this picture completely .",
    "they provide evidence for a recent interaction , which caused a significant increase in star formation , affecting the morphology of the disk .",
    "the results are still around in the form of the nw hi complex , the supergiant hi shell and the se tidal arm .",
    "the interaction described here was a minor one , as it did not result in a large starburst and the ejection of large amounts of gas .",
    "dwarf galaxies can apparently undergo such minor interactions without a noticeable effect on their _ global _ properties .",
    "it is the small distance to ngc 6822 that enables us to study this process in so much detail .",
    "low resolution maps made using data from only the 375 m atca configuration show that if ngc 6822 had been a factor of @xmath48 further away , it would have been impossible to distinguish the nw complex from the main body , nor would the tidal arm and the hole have been obvious",
    ".    the number of minor interactions in dwarf galaxies may therefore be larger than one would guess on the basis of low to medium resolution hi observations of more distant galaxies , or on the basis of observations in other wavelengths .",
    "for example , the low current sfr in ngc 6822 does not give any indication that the galaxy was disturbed recently , in contrast with e.g.  blue compact dwarf galaxies where the enhanced star formation rates clearly indicate some disturbance .",
    "this could lead to a skewed picture of the importance of minor interactions .",
    "ngc 6822 is one of the very few dwarf systems in the local universe that allows such a detailed study of its ism and stellar population . although detailed hi studies of _ nearby _ dwarf and lsb galaxies are needed to further investigate the influence of minor interactions on a more statistical basis ( see also e.g.  taylor 1997 , pisano & wilcots 1999 , hunter et al .",
    "1998 ) , ngc 6822 will remain a benchmark , as it provides the clearest view we currently have of the morphology of a dwarf irregular galaxy outside the immediate milky way / lmc / smc environment .",
    "we now present a possible interaction scenario for ngc6822 based on the observations presented above . as derived earlier , the kinematic age for the giant shell is @xmath1 myr .",
    "the timescale for the nw complex to interact with ngc 6822 is @xmath49 myr .",
    "the kinematical timescale based on the length of the tidal arm is @xmath50 myr .",
    "similar timescales have been derived from optical studies : hodge ( 1980 ) finds evidence for an enhancement in star formation between 75 and 100 myr ago , while the extensive study by gallart et al .",
    "( 1996b ) shows that the sfr in ngc 6822 increased by a factor 2 to 6 between 100 and 200 myr ago .",
    "similarly , hutchings et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find evidence for a 100 myr young population using wfpc2 imaging .",
    "these are good indications that something affected the galaxy some 100 to 200 myr ago .",
    "this was most likely the passage of the nw complex .",
    "this may have caused the sfr to increase , triggering the formation of the giant hi shell in the tidally disturbed se part of the galaxy .",
    "the precise creation mechanism for the large cavity remains a mystery , as is the case with most of the other supergiant hi holes ( e.g.walter & brinks 1999 , puche et al .",
    "1992 , rhode et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the presence of hot gas around the hole would certainly help to rule out or constrain some of the scenarios discussed here . in a few other galaxies",
    "there have been successful attempts to locate the heated gas using x - ray observations ( walter et al .",
    "unfortunately ngc  6822 is located towards an absorbing galactic hi column density of @xmath5110@xmath52@xmath17 which makes a detection of soft x - ray emission originating from hot gas virtually impossible even with today s powerful x - ray telescopes such as chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "follow - up hi , optical and infrared observations ( allowing stellar population studies ) currently in progress and the added benefit of very high resolution in the complete hi dataset ( @xmath53 pc ) , will will shed more light on the state of the ism in ngc 6822 .",
