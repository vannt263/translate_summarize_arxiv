    "the divergent nature of the perturbation theory can be particularly disturbing especially when the coupling constant is large and the divergent behaviour sets in at low order in the loop expansion .",
    "apart from the fundamental problem of disentangling the physical information out of a divergent perturbative expansion , on the phenomenological side one may find out that one is unable to make quantitative predictions of sufficient accuracy because the first few radiative corrections are large , after which the divergent behaviour sets in .    in the hope of elucidating the problem of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism , the lhc will be able to search for a higgs boson up to masses of the order of 1 tev .",
    "a number of higher order calculations of processes at the higgs resonance became available recently .",
    "they indicate that for such heavy higgs bosons the higher order radiative corrections become indeed large @xcite . in the on  shell renormalization scheme ,",
    "if the higgs mass is larger than 930 gev , the two  loop correction to the higgs decay into vector bosons exceeds the one  loop correction @xcite . for the higgs decay into fermions",
    ", this happens at about 1.1 tev @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions are valid for the @xmath1 process @xcite , which will be tested at the lhc , and for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 scatterings @xcite , which were proposed as a production mechanism for higgs bosons at a possible muon collider .",
    "if the one and two  loop corrections which are available are not accidentally very small or very large , and are indicative for the divergent behaviour of the perturbation series , then one must conclude that beyond these limits  of the order of 9001000 gev , depending on the process ",
    "the perturbation theory is totally unreliable in the on  shell scheme . even for lower masses , the theoretical uncertainty due to",
    "the unknown higher order corrections may be substantial .",
    "this view is supported by calculations involving resummations of higher order logarithmic contributions @xcite , where by examining the scheme dependence of the results one can estimate the size of the unknown higher order corrections .",
    "how to recover a physical prediction out of a divergent and not borel summable perturbative expansion is still an open question .",
    "considerable progress has been made in understanding the large order behaviour of perturbation theory , and this may lead to recipes for summing up the perturbative expansion . as an example , the commensurate scale relations among effective charges show promise of dealing with the factorial behaviour associated with the infrared renormalon structure of qcd @xcite .",
    "the justification is that this factorial growth is anyway related to the unknown behaviour of the beta function in a region where the perturbative solution in unreliable",
    ".    as it happens , _ worsening _ the divergent behaviour of a perturbative expansion is a much easier task .",
    "one way of doing this is suggested by ref .",
    "suppose one starts with a perturbative expansion in a given renormalization scheme , with an expansion parameter @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that this series converges well , up to a high enough loop order , for an expansion parameter @xmath4 smaller than a critical value @xmath5 .",
    "in this scheme the physics corresponding to values of @xmath4 smaller than @xmath5 are described well , with controllable accuracy . in order to worsen the divergency of the perturbation series",
    ", one can define a new renormalization scheme by choosing a new expansion parameter @xmath6 , so that the exact , nonperturbative relation between the two expansion parameters , @xmath7 , has a cut starting at @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 can be chosen to be conveniently smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "of course , then the power expansion in terms of the new expansion parameter @xmath6 will converge satisfactorily only over a smaller onset of physics than the perturbation theory in the original scheme .",
    "for instance , one can arrange things so that the renormalization conditions in the new scheme have a solution only for a limited onset of physics , corresponding to @xmath10 .    of course",
    ", this also may happen accidentally , if one performs a calculation in an inconvenient renormalization scheme . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that under certain assumptions the on  shell renormalization conditions for a boson propagator may have no solution for a range of physics for which the pole mass and width are well defined . to show this ,",
    "a model was considered which allows an all  order , nonperturbative solution .",
    "if the exact solution is unknown , and one only knows a few orders in perturbation theory , as is the case with the standard model higgs sector , it is more difficult to establish unambiguously whether such a mechanism is indeed present .",
    "for instance , perturbation theory in the on  shell scheme only gives the higgs propagator as an expansion in the on  shell higgs mass @xmath11 , and one can not directly decide whether the divergent behaviour which one observes is mainly due to a strong selfinteraction of the higgs field or if there is a limit of the values of the on  shell mass @xmath11 beyond which the on  shell renormalization conditions have no solution . if that was the case , larger values of @xmath11 would be unphysical , however stronger selfcouplings than this limit may be possible , and may be appropriately described in the pole renormalization scheme .    in the following section we review the existing knowledge on the position of a heavy higgs pole coming from perturbation theory in the on  shell scheme .",
    "we then derive the corresponding result in the pole renormalization scheme , and show that it converges much better .",
    "we analyze the nonperturbative @xmath12 expansion of an @xmath13 model .",
    "we find no branching point in the @xmath14 relation at leading order which could explain the observed divergency pattern , and speculate on the possibility that such a branching point may be induced at @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in effects related to a heavy higgs boson , so we adopt the framework proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculating leading effects in the higgs mass .",

    "the higgs propagator reads :    @xmath16    and the on  shell mass is defined by the renormalization condition :    @xmath17    the quartic coupling @xmath4 is related at all orders to the on  shell mass @xmath11 by the relation @xmath18 , were @xmath19 gev@xmath20 is the fermi constant .    the self ",

    "1 has a complex pole at an energy @xmath22 which is given by the equation @xmath23 .",
    "the pole mass and width are then defined by @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , the on  shell mass @xmath11 and the pole mass @xmath25 are not the same .    in the on  shell scheme",
    ", one can express @xmath25 and @xmath26 as power series in the expansion parameter @xmath11",
    ". for calculating the location of the higgs pole one has to solve the equation @xmath23 in the second riemann sheet of the complex @xmath0 plane .",
    "it is easy to do this at the one  loop order , where the analytical expression of the self  energy is trivial .",
    "we are interested in including the two and three  loop contributions as well , and for some of these contributions only on  shell results have been calculated so far .",
    "nevertheless , one can solve the pole equation in the complex plane up to the desired order if enough on  shell information is available .    to do this , it is useful to double expand the self  energy in the coupling constant @xmath4 and in the energy distance from the on  shell mass @xmath27 :    @xmath28    here , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are real valued , whereas @xmath31 are complex in general .",
    "the corrections to the higgs decay width are known at two  loop order , so @xmath32 is known with three  loop precision .",
    "@xmath33 is known to two  loop , and @xmath34 is known to vanish at one  loop .",
    "the terms in the expansion which we need for finding a consistent solution of the pole equation at three  loop level are @xcite@xcite :    @xmath35    indeed , one can convince oneself by solving directly the pole equation up to order @xmath36 that its solution reads :    @xmath37   +   { \\cal o}(\\lambda^4)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and therefore the higher order unknown coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not needed for solving the pole equation consistently with three  loop accuracy .",

    "this corresponds to an on  shell mass of about 980 gev , but the perturbative series may be untrustworthy long before .",
    "of course , other measures of the degree of divergency of the series are possible  for instance the point beyond which the distance between the nnlo and the nlo results is larger than that between the nlo and the lo results , for a given pole mass .",
    "this happens for a mass larger than about 710 gev .",
    "in the pole renormalization scheme , the higgs propagator reads :    @xmath46    the coupling of the theory is parameterized by the pole mass @xmath25 , which is defined by the condition :    @xmath47    the higgs width is then expressed as an expansion in @xmath25 .",

    "this relation is plotted in fig .",

    "the interesting point is that the pole scheme expansion appears to converge much better than the on  shell scheme . in eq .",
    "10 , the nlo and the nnlo corrections become equal for @xmath49 tev . at the same time , the nnlo predictions in the on  shell and the pole schemes agree very well over the energy range where the former is supposed to be a good approximation .",
    "however , the @xmath12 expansion deviates considerably from the perturbative solution already at 600650 gev , where perturbation theory should provide a reliable result .",
    "= 14 cm    if the size of the nlo and nnlo corrections in the pole scheme is representative for the divergency of the perturbative series , this behaviour suggests that the pole scheme is a better framework for describing a heavy higgs for phenomenological purposes .",
    "a number of recipes exist in qcd for finding an appropriate renormalization scheme , in which the perturbative results ought to convergence better .",
    "the accuracy of the calculation can be spoiled by choosing a very different renormalization scale because of the presence of large logarithms in higher orders .",
    "the perturbative expansion at the higgs energy scale appears to converge much better in the pole renormalization scheme than in the on  shell scheme , but no large logarithms can be made responsible for this . in this section",
    "we address the question whether this feature may be due to the existence at the nonperturbative level of a certain relation between the on  shell and the pole masses .",
    "the convergence pattern which is observed in the on  shell versus the pole scheme can be understood if one assumes that there is a nonperturbative relation between @xmath11 and @xmath25 , @xmath50 , which has a branching point at a value @xmath51 of the order of 1 tev .",
    "of course , this would induce a strong divergent behaviour in the on  shell scheme near the singularity , even if there the higgs field would not be truly strong selfinteracting . beyond that value , the on  shell mass ceases to be a good parameterization of the higgs selfcoupling",
    ". nevertheless , the quartic coupling of the higgs field may still be not very strong , and the physics at energies comparable to the higgs mass may be described appropriately in the pole scheme .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered a model of a w boson coupled to a large number of light fermions , which is an exactly solvable model , and which displays such a relation between the on  shell and the pole masses .",
    "it is more difficult to establish whether a similar scenario is indeed present in the standard model . to gain further insight",
    ", one has to go beyond the standard perturbation theory .",
    "one promising approach is the nonperturbative @xmath12 expansion of an @xmath13 sigma model .",
    "we anticipate that the leading order solution of the @xmath12 expansion does not display the type of relation between @xmath11 and @xmath25 we are looking for .",
    "nevertheless , such a mechanism may be generated at next  to  leading order .    for fixing the notations",
    ", we consider an @xmath13 sigma model with the lagrangian :    @xmath52    one performs the calculation as an expansion in @xmath12 , keeps only the leading order , and sets in the end @xmath53 and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath54 to 246 gev .",
    "we merely quote the result for the higgs propagator , without repeating this well  known summation of goldstone loops @xcite :    @xmath55^{-1}\\ ] ]    in this expression , the divergency of the bubble diagrams was absorbed in the renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath4 , and one still has the freedom to perform a finite renormalization .",
    "of course , the relation between the higgs mass and width is independent of the actual renormalization scheme .    following einhorn @xcite",
    ", we will define the coupling constant at the energy scale of the higgs pole , @xmath56 , which leads to a convenient parameterization of the results .",
    "therefore , with the definitions :    @xmath57    one obtains the following parameterization :    @xmath58    for each value of @xmath59 , which measures the coupling strength of the higgs field , the on  shell higgs mass @xmath11 is given by the following transcendental equation :    @xmath60 ^ 2 +                  \\left ( \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\pi } \\right)^2 \\right\\ }     =    2 v^2 \\lambda     \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\pi^2}\\log(\\frac{m_h^2}{\\mu^2 } )   \\right ]    \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; , \\ ] ]    with @xmath4 and @xmath61 given by eqns .",
    "14 .    at low values of the coupling , the pole mass and the on ",
    "shell mass have practically the same value , but start to deviate for larger couplings . as the coupling @xmath59 increases",
    ", the pole mass saturates and then starts to decrease , while the width continues to grow .",
    "the pole mass @xmath25 reaches its maximum of 867 gev for @xmath62 .",
    "the on  shell mass has a similar behaviour .",
    "its maximum of 872 gev is reached for a slightly larger value of the coupling , @xmath63 .",
    "the relation between the pole and the on  shell masses is shown in fig .",
    "it shows that in this approximation both masses are practically equally good parameterizations of physics .",
    "they reach their maxima at nearly the same values of the coupling , and for any value of the coupling @xmath64 both on  shell and pole renormalization conditions have solutions .",
    "no branching point is present in the exact relation between @xmath11 and @xmath25 for real @xmath25 smaller than the saturation value , at leading order in the @xmath12 expansion .",
    "= 15 cm    the important difference between the leading order @xmath12 solution of the higgs sector and the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which exhibits the pathological behaviour of the on  shell mass we are looking for , is that the self  energy of the latter contains linear terms in @xmath0 , which are absent in eq .",
    "this is related to the absence of a contribution to the higgs wave function renormalization at leading order in the @xmath13 model .",
    "however , contributions of this type are present at next  to  leading order in the @xmath12 expansion .",
    "it is difficult to find out if the linear terms which should appear at nlo in the @xmath12 expansion are large enough to induce the branching point in the @xmath14 relation we are looking for , without actually performing a nlo calculation of the higgs propagator .",
    "this is unfortunately a very challenging task .",
    "still , one can make a guess about the size of higher order contributions in the @xmath12 expansion by comparing the leading order with the perturbative result .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "2 , the perturbative results and the lo @xmath12 result differ considerably already for a higgs mass of the order of 600 gev . at these values of the higgs mass perturbation theory",
    "appears to be well under control .",
    "the convergence in both on  shell and pole schemes is good , and the two schemes agree very well at nnlo .",
    "in fact , the nnlo perturbative results in the pole and on  shell scheme agree well up to about 900 gev .",
    "unless one takes the view that there is something fundamentally wrong with either the @xmath12 expansion , or perturbation theory , or both , this discrepancy suggests that the @xmath15 corrections are numerically rather substantial .",
    "perturbation theory at the higgs energy scale diverges very badly at about 1 tev in the on  shell scheme .",
    "in particular , the two  loop correction to the higgs width exceeds the one  loop correction if the on  shell higgs mass is larger than 930 gev . for a higgs boson in this mass range",
    "the prediction of the position of the higgs pole is rather unreliable .",
    "we show that the pole renormalization scheme has much better convergence properties . in this scheme ,",
    "the two  loop corrections to the width become as large as the one  loop ones only at 1.74 gev .",
    "this suggests that the pole renormalization scheme is preferable for describing a heavy higgs boson in phenomenological studies of heavy higgs production at future colliders .",
    "this choice of renormalization scheme can not be justified in the same way one chooses the renormalization scale in qcd for resuming large logarithms in higher orders . however , this different behaviour with respect to the convergence range of the on  shell scheme versus the pole scheme may be the result of the existence of a relation between @xmath11 and @xmath25 at the nonperturbative level .",
    "the observed convergence properties are consistent with the assumption that the function @xmath14 has a singularity at an energy of the order of 1 tev , and beyond this critical value the on  shell mass is ill  defined .",
    "we examine the leading order nonperturbative solution of the @xmath65 model in the @xmath12 expansion .",
    "no branching point is present in the @xmath14 function in this approximation for real values of @xmath25 .",
    "the rather large deviation of the leading order @xmath12 expansion from the perturbative result in the range where the latter is expected to be accurate leaves room for substantial @xmath15 corrections . at next  to",
    " leading order in the @xmath12 expansion , the higgs self ",

    "@xcite , which exhibits a branching point .",
