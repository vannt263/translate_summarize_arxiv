    "a typical galaxy remains in a quasi - equilibrium configuration during the secular evolution process . from the virial theorem relation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dynamical mass of the galaxy . and the definition of average surface brightness @xmath2 , where l is the luminosity",
    ", it follows that @xmath3 in order to have a tight tully - fisher relation @xmath4 ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , we must have @xmath5 .",
    "the secular evolution process maintains the scaling relations by a decrease in galaxy s dynamical - mass - to - light ratio as the surface brightness of the galaxy increases during its hubble type transformation ( zhang 2003b ) .",
    "the fundamental plane relation for spirals can likewise be derived from the virial theorem , resulting in @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath8 is the average surface brightness in magnitude / arcsec@xmath9 , and where @xmath1/l @xmath10 .",
    "pharasyn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that fitting i band and k band data of a sample of spiral galaxies to this relation resulted in @xmath11 .",
    "one of the many forms of the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane relation can be expressed as @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) , where @xmath14 refers to the absolute magnitude inside effective radius @xmath15 .",
    "a slight rearrangement of the terms in this equation leads to @xmath16 we see that apart from the constant term , the only difference between the spiral and elliptical fundamental plane relations is in the different signs of the mass - to - light ratio exponent @xmath17 : @xmath18 for spirals and @xmath19 for ellipticals and bulges . as the secular evolution proceeds",
    "( which generally leads to an increase in l ) , the dynamical mass - to - light ratio of a spiral galaxy decreases because a larger fraction of the baryonic dark matter becomes luminous . on the other hand ,",
    "elliptical galaxies are in more advanced stages of evolution and will experience greater degree of dimming , which is reflected in the increase of dynamical mass - to - light ratio with l.",
    "from the above three types of scaling relations , we can easily derive the following variations of the dependence of m@xmath20/l on mass and on light , and the inter - dependence of m@xmath20 and l :          a gradual evolution trend of galaxy properties is thus implied in the three types of scaling relations .",
    "the fact that the m@xmath20/l ratio obtained from the spiral galaxy fundamental plane relation lies intermediate between that given by the spiral galaxy tully - fisher relation and the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane relation is apparently due to the fact that within the spiral fundamental plane relation there is the additional surface brightness parameter .",
    "the spiral fundamental plane effectively samples disk galaxy properties further inward , compared to the tully - fisher relation which samples characteristics averaged over the whole disk .",
    "more detailed discussion of the relation of the secular evolution process to the generation of galaxy structural properties and scaling relations can be found in zhang ( 2003b ) .",
