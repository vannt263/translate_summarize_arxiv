    "<S> three - dimensional ( 3d ) hybrid particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , with kinetic ions and fluid electrons , of a plasma cloud expansion in the solar wind are presented , revealing the dynamics of the expansion , with shock formation , magnetic field compression , and the solar wind ions deflection around the plasma bubble . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities of this system with a magnetosphere are also pointed out .    </S>",
    "<S> solar wind interaction , diamagnetic cavities , magnetospheres    the use of artificial magnetospheres is now under study as a possible protection mechanism for spacecrafts in the interplanetary space environment . </S>",
    "<S> experiments in the laboratory are now being performed @xcite to study the interaction and the deflection of an incoming plasma beam by : i ) a standing dipolar magnetic field , ii ) a plasma cloud expanding into the plasma beam , and iii ) a dipolar magnetic field and a plasma source forming an expanding plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma density in the laboratory is @xmath0 with a temperature of @xmath1 and a velocity of @xmath2 , yielding a low plasma @xmath3 , an acoustic mach number of @xmath4 and an alfvnic mach number of @xmath5 . for the solar wind present in interplanetary space , </S>",
    "<S> the velocity is in the order of @xmath2 , the density is @xmath6 , and the temperature is @xmath7 , yielding @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to substantial physical differences between the two cases that can be bridged via computer simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments in a space plasma environment @xcite , i.e. the expansion of a plasma cloud into the solar wind ( scenario ii ) ) , have shown several distinct characteristics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we illustrate the 3d features of this system . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations are performed using _ dhybrid _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a hybrid code with kinetic ions and fluid electrons . in the hybrid approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the displacement current in ampre s law is neglected , quasi - neutrality is assumed , and moments of the vlasov equation for the electrons are calculated in order to obtain the generalized ohm s law , that yields the electric field @xcite . in our simulations , the solar wind propagates in the @xmath11 direction , </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field is oriented in the @xmath12 direction and the cloud expands in the middle of the simulation box . </S>",
    "<S> the box size is @xmath13 corresponding to @xmath14 ( ion larmor radius ) of the solar wind . </S>",
    "<S> the time step is @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath16 ( ion gyro periods ) and @xmath17 cells are used , with @xmath18 particles per cell , yielding a spatial resolution of @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> a shock front between the incoming solar wind and the cloud is formed ; the magnetic field lines are pushed out of the cloud region by the expanding plasma cloud , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the shock front is characterized by a compression of the magnetic field in the shock region , as can be seen in both fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic barrier created is larger than the volume occupied by the bulk of the plasma cloud ; a similar scenario has also been observed when a dipole magnetic field , and hence a magnetosphere , is present . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the expanding plasma cloud creates a magnetic field void in the cloud zone , i.e. a diamagnetic cavity , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the electric field is quasi - perpendicular to the magnetic field , the field lines taking a counter clockwise orientation due to the velocity of the outward expanding plasma ions , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud ions expand due to their thermal velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the faster ions are , after some time , further away from the cloud center producing an electric field , seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4 ] , that increases in intensity with increasing radius due to the increase in velocity with increasing radius . </S>",
    "<S> such field is responsible also for the ejection of cloud ions in the @xmath20 side of the cloud and the preferred solar wind deflection direction : the solar wind is deflected around the magnetic / plasma barrier , flowing preferentially around the cloud in the @xmath21 side of the cloud .    in conclusion , three - dimensional hybrid simulations of a space plasma experiment </S>",
    "<S> can now capture the relevant physics associated with the expansion of a plasma cloud in the solar wind flow , demonstrating the magnetic field compression ( due to the shock ) , the magnetic field expansion and the increased interaction region due to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these features are similar to the typical case where a magnetosphere is present . </S>",
    "<S> our results illustrate the key physics ruling this scenario , and show the possibility of deflecting the solar wind using the dynamics of a plasma cloud , thus providing benchmarks for the tools required for the interpretation of the ongoing laboratory experiments . </S>"
