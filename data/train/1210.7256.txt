    "advances in technology during the last decades have made it possible to obtain samples of atoms at temperatures in the @xmath0 range @xcite ( optical molasses ) using resonant or quasiresonant exchanges of momentum and energy between atoms and laser light .",
    "the experimental progress that has allowed to construct and preserve quantum states has also opened the possibility of building quantum computing devices dur , sanders , du , berman and has led the scientific community to think that quantum computers could be a reality in the near future .",
    "this progress has been accompanied with the development of the interdisciplinary fields of quantum computation and quantum information . in this scientific framework , the study of simple quantum systems such as the quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) @xcite and the quantum walk ( qw ) @xcite may be useful to understand the quantum behavior of atoms in optical molasses .",
    "the qkr is considered as the paradigm of periodically driven systems in the study of chaos at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "this system shows behaviors without classical equivalent , such as quantum resonance and dynamical localization , which have posed interesting challenges both in theoretical and experimental @xcite terms .",
    "the occurrence of quantum resonance or dynamical localization depends on whether the period of the kick @xmath1 is a rational or irrational multiple of @xmath2 . for rational multiples ,",
    "the behavior of the system is resonant while for irrational multiples the average energy of the system grows in a diffusive manner for a short time and then the diffusion stops and localization appears . from a theoretical point of view the two types of values of @xmath1",
    "determine the spectral properties of the hamiltonian .",
    "for irrational multiples the energy spectrum is purely discrete and for rational multiples it contains a continuous part .",
    "both resonance and localization can be seen as interference phenomena , the first being a constructive interference effect and the second a destructive one .",
    "the qkr has been used as a theoretical model for several experimental situations dealing with atomic traps moore0,kanem , chaudhury , moore1,robinson0,robinson1,bharucha , oskay and is a matter of permanent attention schomerus0,schomerus1,alejo , alejo0,alejo1,alejo2,alejo3,alejo4,alejo5 .",
    "the quantum walk has been introduced aharonov , meyer , watrous , ambainis , kempe , kendon1,kendon2,konno , salvador as a natural generalization of the classical random walk in relation with quantum computation and quantum information processing . in both cases there",
    "is a walker and a coin ; at every time step the coin is tossed and the walker moves depending on the toss output . in the classical random walk the walker moves to the right or to the left , while in the qw coherent superpositions right / left and head / tail happen .",
    "this feature endows the qw with outstanding properties , such as the linear growth with time of the standard deviation of the position of an initially localized walker . as compared with its classical counterpart , where this growth goes as @xmath3",
    "this has strong implications in terms of the realization of algorithms based on qws and is one of the reasons why they have received so much attention . it has been suggested @xcite that the qw can be used for universal quantum computation .",
    "some possible experimental implementations of the qw have been proposed by a number of authors dur , travaglione , sanders , knight , bouwmeester , do , chandrashekar .",
    "in particular the development of techniques to trap samples of atoms using resonant exchanges of momentum and energy between atoms and laser light may also provide a realistic frame to implement quantum computers @xcite .",
    "a parallelism between the behavior of the qkr and a generalized form of the qw was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite showing that these models have similar dynamics . in those papers ,",
    "the modified qw was mapped into a one - dimensional anderson model @xcite , as had been previously done for the qkr @xcite . in the present paper , following the work of saunders @xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite we propose a modification of the qkr .",
    "we study some properties of this new version of the qkr and establish a novel equivalence between this new qkr and the qw .",
    "essentially , the new qkr has an additional degree of freedom which describes the internal ground and excited states of a two - level atom .",
    "we call this new system the two - level quantum kicked rotor ( 2l - qkr ) . in this system",
    "the internal atomic levels are coupled with the momentum of the particle .",
    "this coupling produces an entanglement between the internal degrees of freedom and the momentum of the system .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows , in the next section we present the 2l - qkr system . in the third section",
    "we obtain the time evolution of the moments . in the fourth section the entanglement between the internal degrees of freedom and momentum",
    "is studied . in the last section",
    "some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian that describes a single two - level atom of mass @xmath6 with center - of - mass momentum described by the operator @xmath7 .",
    "its internal ground state is denoted by the vector @xmath8 and its excited state by the vector @xmath9 .",
    "the internal atomic levels are coupled by two equal - frequency laser traveling waves with a controllable phase difference . following @xcite , after a shift of the energy values",
    ", the 2l - qkr hamiltonian can be written as @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the detuning between the laser frequency and atomic transition frequency .",
    "@xmath12 is proportional to the rabbi frequency and we shall refer to it as the strength parameter . @xmath13is a series of periodic dirac s delta applied at times @xmath14 with @xmath15 integer and @xmath1 the kick period .",
    "@xmath16 is the operator of the atom s center of mass position .",
    "finally , @xmath17 is the laser wave - vector magnitude along the @xmath18 direction .    unlike the qkr , in the 2l - qkr the conjugate position and momentum operators have discrete and continuous components , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath19@xmath20where the eigenvalues of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are integers and the eigenvalues of @xmath23 and the eigenvalues of the quasimomentum @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to point out that the operator @xmath25 commutes with both @xmath22 and @xmath26 . using eqs.([z],[p ] ) to substitute @xmath16 and @xmath7 in eq.([ec_ham_qkr_2niveles ] ) yields",

    "the dynamics is such that the system remains in said subspace and the evolution of the system will be only determined by the conjugate operators @xmath26 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore we may restrict ourselves to the study of the evolution constrained to a subspace corresponding to a given eigenvalue of @xmath28 . in this case the composite hilbert space for the hamiltonian eq.(ec_ham_qkr_2nivele ) is the tensor product @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the hilbert space associated to the discrete momentum on the line and it is spanned by the set @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the chirality ( or coin ) hilbert space spanned by two orthogonal vectors @xmath33 . in this composite space",
    "the system evolves , at discrete time steps @xmath34 , along a one - dimensional lattice of sites @xmath35 .",
    "the direction of motion depends on the state of the chirality . taking this into account",
    "it is clear that the hilbert space of the 2l - qkr ( with the preceding restriction ) is identical to that of the usual qw on the line .",
    "the evolution of the system is governed by the hamiltonian given by eq.(ec_ham_qkr_2nivele ) , so that , as is the case for the usual qkr , the unitary time evolution operator for one temporal period @xmath1 can be written as the application of two operators , one representing the unitary operator due to the kick and another being the unitary operator of the free evolution @xcite @xmath36 } e^{i\\kappa cos{\\widehat{\\theta } } \\sigma _ { x } } \\label{evolu0}\\]]where @xmath37 is the pauli matrix in the @xmath38 direction , @xmath39and @xmath40the unit operator eq.([evolu0 ] ) in the momentum representation and in the chirality base @xmath41 has the following shape @xmath42where @xmath43@xmath44 is the kronecker delta , @xmath45 is an integer number and @xmath46the wave - vector in the momentum representation can be expressed as the spinor @xmath47where @xmath48 is the value of @xmath49 for the chosen subspace and @xmath50are the upper and lower components that correspond to the left and right chirality of the qw .",
    "the discrete quantum map is obtained using eqs.([uu],[psi ] ) @xmath51the dynamical evolution of the system up to @xmath14 is obtained applying the above rule eq.([mapa ] ) @xmath15 times .      in this subsection",
    "we solve analytically the evolution of the system given by the map eq.([mapa ] ) .",
    "we consider here the principal resonance @xmath55 in the subspace @xmath56 . due to the quasimomentum conservation",
    "the value of @xmath48 does not change .",
    "therefore the accessible momentum spectrum is discrete and from now on the theoretical development is similar to that of the usual qkr in resonance .",
    "additionally we choose @xmath57 with @xmath58 integer in order to obtain the wave function analytically .",
    "we will show afterwards , using numerical calculation , that the qualitative behavior will be similar for arbitrary @xmath59 . with these conditions the matrix of eq.([uu ] ) only depends on @xmath60 . in order to simplify the notation we define @xmath61using eq.([mapa ] )",
    "the initial condition is connected with the wave function at the time @xmath14 by the equation @xmath62where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    using the relation , @xmath65obtained in appendix a , eq.([mtotal0 ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath66 where @xmath45 is now an arbitrary integer number .",
    "we now find the time evolution of the wave function for @xmath69 .",
    "eq.([uu ] ) shows that in this case the matrix @xmath70 satisfies the relation @xmath71where @xmath72 is the identity matrix .",
    "this last expression together with eq.(mapa ) imply that @xmath73then it is clear that the 2l - qkr shows a periodic behavior when the parameters of the system take the values here considered .",
    "this behavior has no analog in the usual qkr since the parameter @xmath59 does not exist in said system .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to point out that this anti - resonance occurs for @xmath74 , value for which the usual qkr is in resonance and does not present periodic behavior .",
    "the evolution of the variance , @xmath75 , of the probability distribution of momentum is a distinctive feature of the qkr in resonance . it is known that it increases quadratically in time in the quantum case , but only linearly in the classical case . in this section we study the evolution of the variance of the 2l - qkr , once again restricting ourselves to the @xmath56 subspace and taking @xmath76 , which corresponds to the primary resonance of the usual qkr model .",
    "we will obtain the variance from the evolution of the first and second moments , defined as @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , where @xmath79 is the probability to find the particle with momentum @xmath80 at time @xmath81 .",
    "we first consider the resonance defined by @xmath82 . in this case",
    "we are able to calculate the first and second moments analytically using eq.([sol0 ] ) and the properties of the bessel functions ( see appendix b ) , obtaining : @xmath83 + m_{1}(0)\\text { , }   \\label{mome0}\\]]@xmath84 \\right ) \\notag \\\\ & & + \\kappa n\\sum_{j=-\\infty } ^{\\infty } ( 2j+1)\\im \\left [ a_{j}^{0}b_{j+1}^{0\\ast } + a_{j}^{0}b_{j-1}^{0\\ast } \\right ] \\text { }   \\notag \\\\ & & + m_{2}(0)\\text { , }   \\label{mome}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] are respectively the real part and imaginary part of @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the moments at time @xmath90 .",
    "these last equations show that the behavior of the variance @xmath91 has a quadratic time dependence irrespective of the initial conditions taken .",
    "when @xmath92 , it was shown in the previous section that the 2l - qkr has a periodic dynamics and therefore the behavior of the statistical moments will be periodic as well.the case when @xmath93 is cumbersome to solve analytically , so we restrict ourselves to a numerical study .",
    "the evolution of the second statistical moment was obtained for different values of @xmath94 through numerical iterations of the map given by eq.(mapa ) .",
    "it was found , for all the considered values of @xmath95 , that the long - time behavior of the second moment ( and therefore of the variance ) is quadratic after an initial transient .",
    "the duration of the initial transient depends on the initial conditions and the value of @xmath94 .",
    "this features can be appreciated in fig.([f1 ] ) .     as a function of the dimensionless time . ]",
    "the figure shows the time evolution of the second moment for the initial conditions @xmath96 .",
    "it can be appreciated that the second moment approaches a quadratic behavior after an oscillatory transient .",
    "it was found that the nearer the parameter @xmath94 is to @xmath97 , the more pronounced this oscillation is .",
    "in the context of qws several authors carneiro , abal , annabestani , omar , pathak , liu , venegas , endrejat , bracken , ellinas , maloyer , alejo2010,alejo2012 have been investigating the relationship between the asymptotic coin - position entanglement and the initial conditions of the walk . in order to compare the model considered in this paper with the qw , we investigate the asymptotic chirality - momentum entanglement in the 2l - qkr .",
    "the unitary evolution of the 2l - qkr generates entanglement between chirality and momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "this entanglement will be characterized carneiro , alejo2010 by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator , called entropy of entanglement .",
    "the quantum analog of the gibbs entropy is the von neumann entropy @xmath98where @xmath99 is the density matrix of the quantum system .",
    "owing to the unitary dynamics of the 2l - qkr , the system remains in a pure state , and this entropy vanishes . in spite of this chirality and momentum are entangled , and the entanglement can be quantified by the associated von neumann entropy for the reduced density operator : @xmath100where @xmath101tr@xmath102 is the reduced density matrix that results from taking the partial trace over the momentum space .",
    "the reduced density operator can be explicitly obtained using the wave function eq.([psi ] ) in the subspace @xmath56 and its normalization properties @xmath103where @xmath104 @xmath105@xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath108 may be interpreted as the time - dependent probabilities for the system to be in the excited and the ground states respectively . in order to investigate the entanglement dependence on the initial conditions , we consider the localized case , that is the initial state of the rotor is assumed to be sharply localized with vanishing momentum and arbitrary chirality , thus @xmath109where @xmath110 $ ] and @xmath111 $ ] define a point on the unit three - dimensional bloch sphere .",
    "eq.(sol0 ) takes the following form @xmath112 substituting eq.([wave ] ) into eqs.([pe],[peb],[qu ] ) and using the properties of the bessel functions , we obtain : @xmath113 \\text { , } \\label{pe2}\\]]@xmath114 \\text { , } \\label{peb2}\\]]@xmath115 \\text{. }   \\label{qu2}\\ ] ] the eigenvalues of the density operator @xmath116 , eq.([rc ] ) , as a function of @xmath108 , @xmath107 and @xmath117 is @xmath118 ,   \\label{lam}\\ ] ] and the reduced entropy as a function of these eigenvalues is @xmath119 therefore the dependence of the entropy on the initial conditions is expressed through the angular parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this means that , given certain initial conditions , the degree of entanglement of the chirality and momentum degrees of freedom is determined.it is seen from eqs.([pe2],[peb2],[qu2 ] ) that the occupation probabilities and the coherence @xmath122 tend to a certain limit when @xmath123 . in this limit @xmath124 and",
    "both of the occupation probabilities tend to @xmath125 , irrespective of the initial conditions .",
    "however , in the asymptotic regime , dependence on the initial conditions is still maintained by @xmath122 , and therefore by the entropy as well .",

    "these results were established analytically and numerically for different values of the parameter space of this system that correspond to the primary resonance of the usual qkr model .",
    "the above two behaviors also characterize the qw on the line and hence establish again an equivalence between the qw and the 2l - qkr .",
    "this suggests that experiments that are related to each of two models should also carry some kind of physical equivalence between them .",
    "we have found also that , although our system exhibits characteristics similar to those found in the usual qkr model , there are still novel features , such as the existence of the anti - resonance described in section ii b , which have no analogue in the simple qkr model .",
