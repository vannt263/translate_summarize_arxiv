    "the idea that studying the zeroes of the partition function of a statistical mechanical model when a physical parameter was extended to complex values might provide valuable insights on critical behaviour in lattice models was first promulgated by lee and yang @xcite for field - driven transitions and later by fisher and others for temperature - driven transitions @xcite .",
    "although there has been a considerable body of work studying the partition function zeroes of the ising and potts model on various regular lattices , most notably in recent years in @xcite , there has been little investigation of the spin models on lattices exhibiting some form of geometrical disorder , such as random graphs , both for the annealed and quenched case .",
    "some cases that have been investigated such as penrose tilings have revealed intricate structure for the fisher ( complex temperature ) zeroes away from the real axes , while still possessing onsager scaling behaviour at the physical critical point @xcite . others , such as the ising model on annealed ensembles of planar @xmath1 random graphs and the dual quadrangulations possess fisher zeroes which do lie on curves in the complex temperature plane @xcite , but which are different from the double - circle locus of the regular square lattice .",
    "this in itself is interesting , since it shows that a distinct locus still exists when a sum over a class of graphs is folded into the partition function along with a sum over spin configurations .",
    "for both planar and generic , non - planar random graphs perturbative calculations strongly suggest that the lee - yang ( complex field ) zeroes still lie on the unit circle in the complex activity plane @xcite , even though the technical assumptions of the original lee - yang theorem no longer apply in this case .",
    "the previous work on both fat and thin random graph models has relied entirely on perturbative expansions and monte - carlo simulations to investigate the various loci of zeroes .",
    "there is rather more information at hand in both these cases , however , since exact evaluations of the partition function are possible in the thermodynamic limit using matrix integral / orthogonal polynomial methods in the planar case and a straightforward saddle - point calculation in the non - planar case . in the case of the ising model on regular two - dimensional lattices",
    "the particular form of the solution for the free energy , as a double trigonometrical integral over a logarithm , allowed a direct identification of the loci of zeroes as the curves or regions where the argument of the logarithm was zero .",
    "the fat and thin random graph solutions no longer have this form  they are even simpler , being directly the logarithms of algebraic expressions , which differ in the high and low temperature phases but match at the transition point , as they should .    the general question of how to extract loci of zeroes for models with first order transitions when one has some analytical expression or approximation for the partition function or free energy available has recently been addressed by biskup _",
    "they showed that under suitable technical conditions the partition function of a @xmath2-dimensional statistical mechanical model defined in a periodic volume @xmath3 which depends on a complex parameter @xmath4 can be written in terms of complex functions @xmath5 describing @xmath6 different phases as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the degeneracy of phase @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the inverse temperature and @xmath11 is of the order of the correlation length .",
    "the various @xmath12 are to be interpreted as the metastable free energies of the phases , with @xmath13 characterising the free energy when phase @xmath9 is stable .",
    "the zeroes of the partition function are then determined to lie within @xmath14 of the solutions of the remarkably simple equations @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "since we have written an expression for @xmath17 that incorporates phase co - existence we are implicitly looking at models with first order transitions , the canonical example being the field - driven transition for the ising model .    the equations ( [ master ] ) show that zeroes of @xmath17 asymptotically lie on the complex phase coexistence curves @xmath18 in the complex @xmath4-plane .",
    "indeed , the idea that the loci of zeroes might be thought of as stokes lines which separate different asymptotic behaviours and that the real part of the free energy in the various phases should match along the lines is already implicit in @xcite .    it might appear erroneous to attempt to apply these results , formulated for first order transitions and based on ideas arising from phase co - existence , to models where the physical temperature - driven transition is continuous",
    "however , when considered in the complex temperature plane such transitions will be continuous only at the physical point itself and possibly some other finite set of points",
    ". this can be seen by looking at expressions for the magnetization for the ising model , for example , on the square lattice , on fat @xmath1 graphs and on thin @xmath19 graphs : @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath22 apply through the complex extension of the low - temperature phase , and @xmath22 will be zero outside this region .",
    "we can thus see that although @xmath22 will vanish continuously at the physical critical points , @xmath23 respectively , it will generically be non - zero at the phase boundary approaching from within the low temperature region , whereas it will be zero approaching from outside .",
    "there are further discrete points where the magnetization vanishes continuously : at the anti - ferromagnetic point @xmath24 and the unphysical point @xmath25 on the square lattice ; and the unphysical point @xmath26 on the planar @xmath1 graphs .",
    "it should also be remarked that the apparent singularities in the expressions for @xmath22 at @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively are spurious since they lie outside the domain of applicability of the expressions .",
    "since we only have a discrete set of points along the phase boundary where @xmath22 vanishes continuously , a typical point will be first order in nature and the arguments of @xcite may safely be deployed to determine the locus of zeroes .",
    "the results of @xcite give a very natural interpretation of the loci of partition function zeroes as phase coexistence curves for suitably complex extended phases , both for lee - yang and fisher zeroes .",
    "such a picture is also in accordance with the `` dynamical systems '' determination of partition function zeroes @xcite for models which may be defined in terms of some sort of recursive renormalization group map . in these cases",
    "the loci of zeroes appear as the julia set of the map  in other words , the boundaries of the basins of attraction for the map , or phase boundaries of the complex extended phases .    in this paper",
    "we find the locus of fisher zeroes for the ising model on 3-regular and 4-regular non - planar random graphs @xcite , where such an expression can be calculated by saddle point methods and on the corresponding bethe lattices where rather different recursive methods arrive at an identical answer . as a warm up exercise",
    "we show that the methods employed in the study of 3-regular and 4-regular graphs also reproduce the known results for zeroes that have been obtained by transfer matrix methods @xcite in the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts model on 3-regular and 4-regular random lattices may be treated in a similar manner to the ising model and the locus of fisher zeroes obtained for general @xmath0 . since @xmath0 appears in the solution for the @xmath0 state potts model as a parameter",
    "we are also at liberty to look at chromatic zeroes for our random graphs , which involves looking at the saddle point solutions for the ground state of the anti - ferromagnetic potts model in the complex @xmath0-plane .",
    "the partition function for the ising model with hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 , on 2-regular random graphs with @xmath32 vertices ( i.e. on a one - dimensional ring ) may be written as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of undecorated rings and @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 the action itself is a direct transcription of the matrix model action @xcite to scalar variables @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the above @xmath40 can be thought of as representing `` up '' spin vertices and @xmath41 `` down '' spin vertices .",
    "since the integral is gaussian we are not obliged to pursue the saddle - point evaluation that is necessary in the next section for 3-regular and 4-regular graphs  we can simply carry out the integral directly . scaling away the vertex counting factor of @xmath42",
    "we find that the free energy per site is given by the logarithm of the dominant eigenvalue of the quadratic form in the propagator , @xmath43 the partition function zeroes and hence free energy singularities appear when the square root in the above expression is zero and both roots can contribute @xmath44 which recovers the equation for the lee - yang edge derived in @xcite .",

    "@xmath35 is defined as above and the action now has the appropriate potential for generating @xmath19 graphs @xmath47 it is necessary to include the counting factor @xmath34 to disentangle the factorial growth of the undecorated graphs from any non - analyticity due to phase transitions in the decorating spins .",
    "one is also obliged to pick out the @xmath45-th order in the expansion explicitly with the contour integral over @xmath42 as , unlike the planar graphs of two - dimensional gravity , @xmath42 can not be tuned to a critical value to cause a divergence .",
    "the mean - field ising transition manifests itself in this formalism as an exchange of dominant saddle points . solving the saddle point equations",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 which we have rescaled to remove @xmath42 and an irrelevant overall factor , we find a symmetric high - temperature solution @xmath50 which bifurcates at @xmath51 to the low - temperature solutions @xmath52 the bifurcation point is determined by the value of @xmath53 at which the high- and low - temperature solutions for @xmath54 are identical , which appears at the zero of the hessian @xmath55 .",
    "the magnetisation order parameter for the ising model can also be transcribed directly from the matrix model @xcite @xmath56 and shows a continuous transition with mean - field critical exponent ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the other critical exponents may also be calculated and take on mean - field values .    if one carries out a saddle point evaluation of equ .",

    "( [ isingsol0],[isingsol ] ) .",
    "since we wish to match @xmath60 between phases in order to find the loci of the partition function zeroes we are demanding in this case @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the low - temperature saddle - point solution and @xmath63 is the high - temperature saddle - point solution , both to be taken for complex @xmath53 @xmath64    the resulting locus of fisher zeroes is shown in fig .  1 , and is slightly unusual in that it is not a closed curve as is usually the case for ising and potts models on regular lattices , but rather a cusp .",
    "it is not unique in not being a closed curve , however , since the the locus of the fisher zeroes for the one - dimensional ising model is all of the imaginary axis . for one - dimensional potts models a similar result holds , with the zeroes lying on a vertical line in the @xmath65 plane passing through the real axis at @xmath66 .",
    "the random graph ising model has mean - field exponents because of the locally tree - like structure , so the scaling relation relating the angle @xmath67 which the zeroes make as they approach the real axis , the critical heat exponent @xmath68 and the two critical amplitudes @xmath69 , @xmath70 = { \\cos ( \\pi \\alpha ) - a_+ / a_- \\over \\sin ( \\pi \\alpha ) } , \\label{slope}\\ ] ] predicts .",
    "note that the original discussion was in terms of @xmath71 , but since we are dealing with conformal transformations any conclusions about angles will still hold , as can easily be confirmed by plotting the locus directly in terms of @xmath72 . ] @xmath73 .",
    "this is indeed what is observed at the cusp of the locus ( @xmath74 ) in fig.1 .",
    "it should be remarked that a little care is needed in applying equ .",
    "( [ match ] ) since the presence of the moduli signs means that one runs of risk of picking up `` wrong sign '' solutions .",
    "this is easily resolved when the complex phases are extensions of real phases as in the present case , when the behaviour on the real axis can be examined to make sure that the correct sign has been chosen .    the determination of the fisher zeroes locus on other random regular graphs proceeds in the same manner as on the @xmath19 graphs . on @xmath1 ( four - regular )",
    "graphs , for instance the action becomes @xmath75 and the saddle - point solutions are @xmath76 and @xmath77 at high and low temperatures , respectively .",
    "these lead to the saddle point actions @xmath78 which are matched in the same manner as for the @xmath19 graphs and also lead to a cusp locus , with the cusp now at @xmath79 .    both the @xmath19 and @xmath1 curves appear rather like a folium of descartes with the loop that would lie to the right of the cusp excised .",
    "the @xmath19 curve turns out to have a rather more complicated formula @xmath80 which is deduced from expressing @xmath81 in terms of the real , @xmath82 , and imaginary , @xmath83 parts of @xmath84 .",
    "however , the expression for the @xmath1 curve @xmath85 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath86 is indeed a rescaling of the standard folium .",

    "it is clear from these expressions that demanding @xmath105 gives us back exactly the same expression for the fisher locus as in the random graph case , namely : @xmath106 the first two terms in each of eqs .",

    "( [ part ] ) .    that the bethe lattice with three neighbours should have the same fisher zeroes as the @xmath19 random graph is not unexpected , since the ratio of the saddle point solutions for the random graph model gives precisely the recursion relation ( [ curses ] ) and both exhibit mean - field critical behaviour .",
    "the fixed point of the recursion variable @xmath90 in the bethe lattice solution is equal to the ratio of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 solutions in the random graph case .",
    "this equivalence between the random graph and bethe lattice models is quite generic and also applies to the potts models which we now move on to discuss .",

( [ part ] ) can be used to define the partition function for a @xmath0-state potts model where the hamiltonian can be written @xmath110 the spins @xmath111 now take on @xmath0 values , so one might expect by analogy with the ising model ( @xmath112 ) that @xmath0 `` fields '' @xmath54 might be needed .",

    "the locus of fisher zeroes can now be obtained by demanding @xmath125 for complex @xmath53 .    a schematic graph of the locus of zeroes for general @xmath126 is shown in fig .  2 where it can be seen that the physical locus of zeroes , shown in bold , crosses the real axis in the physical region of the parameter ( @xmath127 ) at the first - order transition point @xmath128 .",
    "this physical locus lies inside a larger metastable locus , shown dashed , which has a cusp at the spinodal point @xmath129 .",
    "the loop in the ising locus , which was excised by comparing the actions along the real axis , has split into the two dashed mirror inner loops lying off the axis in the potts models . referring back to fig .",
    "1 we can see that in the ising case the first - order locus vanishes but the cusp remains and takes over the role of the physical locus . at @xmath130",
    "we would assign @xmath131 for a first order transition point so the angle of approach to the real axis should be @xmath132 from equ.([slope ] ) , which is what is observed .",
    "the other crossing point @xmath133 lies outside the physical region @xmath127 .",
    "perhaps a slightly fairer comparison with the ising model is to plot the loci in the @xmath134 plane which we have also done in fig .",
    "the outer ovoid is now the genuine locus of zeroes and the metastable locus maps onto the tri - foliate structure that lies largely inside this . in the variable",
    "@xmath135 the physical region is @xmath136 .",
    "one particularly interesting feature of the potts saddle - point solution is that @xmath0 appears as a parameter , so it is possible to obtain the fisher locus for non - integer or even complex @xmath0-values .",
    "this means that in principle one can also investigate the complex @xmath0-properties of the chromatic polynomials on the random graphs .",
    "the chromatic polynomial @xmath137 on a given graph @xmath138 of order @xmath32 encodes the number of ways that @xmath138 may be @xmath0-coloured so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour .",
    "it is related to the partition function of the anti - ferromagnetic potts model @xmath139 on @xmath138 in the zero - temperature limit , @xmath140 we can follow shrock and tsai @xcite and consider a limiting function @xmath141 on some class of graphs @xmath142 , in our case random regular graphs , @xmath143 which is related to the free energy ( per site ) of the corresponding potts model @xmath144 and gives us that the saddle - point action is effectively the limiting function , @xmath145 . since @xmath146 corresponds to @xmath147 we can write down an action in this limit by making a suitable substitution for @xmath53 in equ .",
    "( [ app1 ] ) @xmath148 instead of looking for high- and low - temperature saddle - point solutions of this action , we are now interested in finding the `` high @xmath0 '' ( @xmath63 , @xmath149 ) and `` low @xmath0 '' ( @xmath62 , @xmath150 ) solutions , which are given by @xmath151 respectively .",
    "we can now ape the procedure for finding the locus of fisher zeroes to determine the locus of chromatic zeroes by examining the curves defined by @xmath152 in the complex @xmath0-plane rather than the complex @xmath53-plane .",
    "although presented in a disguised form this turns out to be the limaon of pascal shown in fig .  4 , adding nicely to our collection of classical plane curves .",
    "we can see that , as expected , there are real zeroes at @xmath153 and @xmath112 indicating that the three - regular random graph can not be one or two - coloured .",
    "interestingly a zero also appears on the negative real axis , which is a somewhat unusual occurrence .",
    "there is no zero at @xmath154 since brook s theorem in graph theory @xcite tells us that if g is a connected graph with maximal co - ordination number @xmath155 , and if g is not complete , then the chromatic number @xmath156 of g is @xmath4 .",
    "here we have a 3-regular graph that is not complete , so @xmath157 and we can avoid frustration completely with 3 colours .",
    "we have seen that both fisher and chromatic zero loci may be traced out on thin random graphs by adapting the approach of @xcite which was originally formulated in the context of first order phase transitions .",
    "we argued that even transitions that were continuous at the physical critical point would generically display first order properties at all but a finite set of points and that the formulae of equ.([master ] ) could thus still be employed .",
    "these gave a cusp - like locus , similar to an amputated folium of descartes , for the ising fisher zeroes and a rather more complicated structure for the @xmath126 potts models , where the ising - like cusp was still present as a metastable locus .",
    "the limiting chromatic zero locus on @xmath19 graphs , remarkably , emerged as a limaon .",
    "the ising model on the bethe lattice with 3 neighbours per site returned the same fisher zeroes as the @xmath19 graphs by a rather different route , showing again the effective equivalence of the models .",
    "we have not discussed the case of _ planar _ random graphs here , but a similar approach can be applied to the solutions of @xcite , and compared with the series expansions and monte - carlo simulations of @xcite .",
    "similarly , we have concentrated entirely on fisher zeroes , but it is clear following @xcite that one can also examine the behaviour of the lee - yang zeroes .    in summary , noting that the locus of partition function zeroes can be thought of as phase boundaries in the complex temperature plane gives a useful way of determining the the locus of fisher zeroes in the thermodynamic limit for ising and potts models on random graphs , as well as chromatic zeroes .",
