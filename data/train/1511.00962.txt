    "transport through strongly correlated system , where a perturbative treatment of interactions fails , is a difficult yet important field of study with implications for molecular electronics , impurity effects in materials etc .",
    "it continues to be a subject of intense research , and several methods to deal with such systems have been developed @xcite .",
    "if the interactions can be assumed to be localized in a small region , exact diagonalization methods can be brought to bear on the problem @xcite . a successful strategy , the embedded cluster approximation@xcite , has been to split from the infinite system a finite part that can be treated with accurate methods , and then connected to the rest of the system perturbatively on the green s function level .    in this work",
    "we will follow a similar strategy , but we instead take the self - energy of the finite system as a starting point for approximating the infinite system @xcite . by making use of the chebyshev polynomial method , we can treat larger finite systems exactly , and",
    "thus improve the quality of our approximate self - energies .",
    "the system under study consists of a finite interacting cluster connected ( embedded ) to several infinite non - interacting leads ( @xmath0 ) , described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 describes the finite system ( with @xmath3 containing the interactions ) , @xmath4 the non - interacting lead @xmath0 , and @xmath5 the lead - cluster connection .",
    "we want to obtain the retarded green s function @xmath6 in the cluster in the presence of the leads , to gain access to observables like single - particle densities , conductances and spectral functions .",
    "our starting point is the dyson equation for @xmath6 in equilibrium @xmath7 \\bm{g}(\\omega).\\ ] ] the terms in this equation are matrices , their elements corresponding to particle / hole propagation between any two sites of the cluster .",
    "@xmath8 is the non - interacting non - embedded green s function for the cluster , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are self - energies describing the interaction and the coupling to the leads ( embedding ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the precise form of @xmath11 , which we assume to be known , depends only on the structure of the leads , and can be calculated separately .",
    "our main focus is the interaction self - energy @xmath9 , which describes the correlations in the system .",
    "it is affected by the presence of the infinite leads , and therefore has no simple expression and has to be approximated .",
    "a simple way forward is to replace it with the interaction self - energy of the disconnected cluster , for which we have @xmath12 if we can calculate the green s function of the cluster @xmath13 , we obtain the self - energy via @xmath14 @xmath15 is easily calculated , since it comes from a non - interacting system . calculating @xmath16 amounts to solving the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 many - body problems , which we now describe .",
    "to obtain @xmath20 we utilize the chebyshev polynomial expansion method which we here describe briefly . for details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials of the first ( @xmath21 ) and second ( @xmath22 ) kind are defined recursively as @xmath23 they form orthogonal sets within the interval @xmath24 $ ] .    to simplify the equations we further define the functions @xmath25 which fulfill the orthogonality relation @xmath26 we can expand any function @xmath27 within @xmath24 $ ] in terms of @xmath28 as @xmath29,\\ ] ] where the moments are given by @xmath30 . since in practise we expand to a finite order @xmath31 , we add additional factors @xmath32 to dampen oscillations in the resulting approximation .",
    "the problem of determining the optimal @xmath32 is described in detail in @xcite , and following their advice we choose @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out to be advantageous to first compute the spectral function @xmath34 , and obtain the corresponding green s function from @xcite @xmath35 the @xmath17-particle spectral function can be obtained via the lehmann representation @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are compound quantum numbers containing both site and spin indices , and @xmath39 is the @xmath40:th eigenstate of the system with @xmath17 particles and energy @xmath41 .",
    "the moments are given by @xmath42 where substituting @xmath43 and using @xmath44 leads to @xmath45 the spectral function is a sum of delta functions located at @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "because the chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal only within the interval @xmath48 $ ] , we need to shift and scale the energies to make sure that no poles fall outside the limits . here",
    "we choose the zero of energy so that @xmath49 and furthermore scale the unit of energy by @xmath50 , which guarantees that @xmath51 $ ] for all @xmath52 .",
    "a small @xmath53 ensures that the spectrum does not reach the edges of the interval , where stability problems might arise .",
    "the rescaled moments become @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and we have defined the addition ( @xmath56 ) and removal ( @xmath57 ) moments .    three hamiltonian matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 are needed for the computation . first",
    "the ground state @xmath60 is found through lanczos iteration of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "then the moments for addition and removal processes are computed separately .",
    "for the addition part we first compute and store the states @xmath62 and @xmath63 . then , denoting @xmath64 , the application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cherecur ] ) gives us @xmath65 this recursion represents the main numerical effort in the algorithm .",
    "it consists chiefly of matrix - vector multiplications ( generally with a very sparse matrix ) , which is an operation that can be very efficiently parallelized .    after performing the iteration to a sufficient order ,",
    "the moments are obtained by computing the inner product @xmath66 .",
    "an analogous process gives the removal moments .",

    "finally , we reverse the energy scaling by @xmath72 .      as an aside",
    ", we mention that the chebyshev method can also be utilized in the case of finite temperature . the spectral function is then given by @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the inverse temperature and @xmath76 the partition function .    by defining the functions @xcite @xmath77 we can express the spectral function as @xmath78 e^{-\\beta y},\\ ] ] and expand it using a two dimensional chebyshev expansion .",

    "one therefore does not need to solve any eigenstates .",
    "note also that the main numerical effort is in calculating @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which are independent of temperature . storing these functions thus allows for efficient computation of quantities over temperature ranges .",
    "as the simplest case of transport through an interacting system , we consider transport through a quantum dot , i.e. the single - impurity anderson model .",
    "we consider one - dimensional leads , with the first few sites taken to be a part of the central cluster . by extending the cluster we hope to obtain a self - energy closer to that of the full embedded system .",
    "if the leads are identical , we can handle an arbitrary number of them by utilizing the rotation symmetry of the system .",
    "this we demonstrate below . in the same framework",
    ", we can also allow for hopping between adjacent leads .",
    "the hamiltonian for a quantum dot connected to @xmath85 one - dimensional leads ( @xmath52 ) with @xmath86 sites ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) in each is @xmath87 where the first term contains hopping along the leads , second is the lead - dot connection , third connects neighboring leads , and fourth and fifth are the dot potential and interaction .    we exploit the symmetry of this system by a unitary transformation , defining the operators @xmath88 in terms of which the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath89 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the hamiltonian is therefore divided into @xmath85 independent commuting terms corresponding to different wavenumbers for rotation of phase when going around the dot .",

    "see figure [ fig : transformation ] for an illustration of this transformation .",
    "the spectral function of the whole system @xmath94 can be expressed in terms of the spectral functions @xmath95 of the @xmath85 subsystems : @xmath96 where @xmath97 can be calculated using the method described in the previous chapter , and @xmath95 are easily obtained , being spectral functions of non - interacting systems .",

    "figure [ fig : disconnected_results ] shows results obtained using the above machinery for finite anderson systems .",
    "we show the dot - to - dot components of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , using interaction strength @xmath101 , dot potential @xmath102 and nearest neighbor hopping @xmath103 unless otherwise stated . hopping between leads",
    "is here turned off ( @xmath104 ) . in all cases",
    "the system is spin symmetric with an equal number of spin up and spin down particles , and either at half - filling or one particle over half - filling ( if the number of sites is odd ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : disconnected_resultsa ] we increase the lead length in a system with two leads .",
    "the spectral functions here have a distinct structure : a central peak cluster around @xmath105 , and two side peak clusters on either side .",
    "one can understand the structure in terms of lead / dot occupation .",
    "the side clusters contain transitions where the dot occupation is changed ( addition on the right , removal on the left ) , while the central cluster contains transitions where the dot occupation remains relatively unchanged and instead the lead occupation changes .",
    "each cluster corresponds to a different dot occupation , and therefore the energy scale separating them is determined by the dot potential and interaction .",
    "the peaks within each cluster , on the other hand , correspond to lead excitations , and the scale of their spread is determined by the scale of the hopping terms in the leads .",
    "this is a helpful picture , but note that it is only approximate , and predicated on the fact that the two energy scales are here distinct .    from figure",
    "[ fig : disconnected_resultsa ] we see that increasing the lead length results in additional peaks appearing in each cluster .",
    "these can be understood to represent new possible transitions corresponding to new lead states .",
    "figure [ fig : disconnected_resultsb ] shows the effect of increasing the hopping along the leads ( with dot - to - lead hopping kept constant ) .",
    "this increases the energy related to lead excitations causing the peak clusters to widen .",
    "when @xmath106 one of the lead state transitions hits a resonance with a dot state transition , leading to hybridization of the corresponding states , and the side peaks splitting as a result .",
    "this signals the break down of the simplified picture represented above , since the hybridized states are no longer associated with a specific dot occupation value .",
    "it is tempting to imagine the limit of infinitely long leads and high lead hopping , which corresponds to the anderson impurity model in the kondo regime .",
    "the spectral function in this limit contains broadened coulomb blockade side peaks at @xmath107 , as well as a sharp kondo peak at @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the results in figure [ fig : disconnected_resultsa ] show all the signs of approaching the correct limit , with the side peaks moving toward @xmath107 and the central peaks inching toward each other to , presumably , merge at @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore the resonance between lead transitions and dot transitions would in the limit of infinite number of side peaks in the central cluster lead to the broadening of the side peaks , while the absence of similar process for the central peaks might conceivably leave them sharp .    in figure",
    "[ fig : disconnected_resultsc ] the dot potential @xmath108 is shifted .",
    "note that the central peak cluster shows resistance to the change in @xmath108 , while the side peak clusters shift roughly linearly with @xmath108 .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in transport in the kondo regime @xcite , where the kondo peak is resistant to the gate potential , while the coulomb blockade side peaks will shift linearly .",
    "we note that the functions are even functions of @xmath109 .",
    "the spectral functions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : spec ] ) , consisting of particle addition and removal parts , will be symmetric if the ground state of the system is particle - hole symmetric , i.e. if the system is at half - filling and the occupation is uniform .",
    "a half - filled state will have uniform occupation if the interaction strengths and site potentials are chosen so that the energy costs related to adding or removing a particle from a singly occupied site are equal .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath110 in the systems considered here .",
    "figure [ fig : disconnected_resultsc ] demonstrates how the symmetry is broken when the potential is shifted .",
    "we see , however , that spectral functions in figure [ fig : disconnected_resultsa ] are symmetric even though the system as a whole is not at half - filling ( having an odd number of sites ) .",
    "this behavior becomes more clear after the symmetry transformation , when the interacting subsystem is left with an even number of sites .",
    "if lead - to - lead hopping is not allowed , our calculations have always shown this subsystem to be at half - filling on the ground state , which explains the symmetry .",
    "the non - interacting subsystems may not be at half - filling , but this does not matter since they do not contribute to the dot - to - dot component of @xmath94 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spec_decomp ] ) .",
    "allowing inter - lead hopping can again break the symmetry .",
    "this is because it causes energy shifts in the subsystems ( the @xmath111 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transformedh ] ) ) .",
    "the energy shifts can lead to a different particle distribution among the subsystems . because of this the interacting subsystem ( @xmath112 ) can move away from half - filling , breaking the particle - hole symmetry and thus the symmetry of the spectral function .",
    "using the techniques described in the previous sections , we can obtain the _ exact _ interaction self - energy for a finite system . in general , this procedure will yield a self - energy matrix , which can then be implanted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) to obtain the embedded green s function .",
    "in order to simplify the discussion , however , we will continue with the single - impurity anderson system . in this case",
    "only the dot - to - dot component of the interaction self - energy is non - zero , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) becomes a scalar equation for the dot - to - dot component of the retarded green s function @xmath113 for an anderson impurity connected to finite leads , we have @xmath114 where @xmath115 stands for finite .",
    "the embedding self - energy now results from a finite number of sites , and the interaction self - energy only describes interaction events of the finite system .",
    "we form an approximate @xmath6 for the infinite system by implanting @xmath116 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : infinite_greens_function ] ) @xmath117 where the dot is now embedded to infinite leads , but the interaction events are contained within the parts of the leads included in our finite system .",
    "increasing the size of the finite system will improve the approximation , ultimately reaching the exact result in the limit .",
    "a natural question is then , how big is big enough ?",
    "from the finite system . right : @xmath118 using the implantation method . , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in order to see how the implantation method fares , we solve the finite lead - dot - lead system exactly and construct the exact interaction self - energy @xmath119 .",
    "we perform calculations for different lead lengths in order to see how the results change . due to symmetry considerations ,",
    "the leads have to be identical , and thus we have an odd number of sites in our system .",
    "we consider @xmath120 , and put @xmath121 at the central site .",
    "we then calculate @xmath122 and @xmath123 using the polynomial expansion method , and then implant @xmath124 into the single - impurity anderson model via eq .",
    "( [ eqanderson ] ) . here",
    ", we use semi - infinite tight - binding leads@xcite , and @xmath125 . for different fillings",
    ", we can define @xmath126 by forcing the density of the impurity site in the infinite system to coincide with the one from the finite system . in this section",
    ", we use a different normalization of @xmath127 , to be more consistent with the literature .",
    "the spectral functions for the finite and infinite anderson models are shown in figure [ figimplantation ] .",
    "the spectral functions for the finite systems have small but finite peak widths , which is due to them being expressed in terms of polynomials of finite order @xcite .",
    "we note that there is no peak at @xmath128 . in the implantation scheme ,",
    "the spectral features are broadened in an inhomogeneous way .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a peak at @xmath105 .",
    "apart from the additional sharp peaks , we obtain the characteristic three - peak structure@xcite with two coulomb blockade peaks at @xmath129 and a sharp kondo peak at @xmath105 .",
    "the features broadly agree with the true spectral function of the anderson model in this parameter regime .    in order to understand the broadening",
    ", we study in more detail the spectral function . in the formulas",
    ", we treat the semi - infinite leads in the wide - band limit approximation , which means that we take the embedding self - energy to be purely imaginary and equal to its value at @xmath130 @xmath131 , where @xmath132 .",
    "this will slightly overestimate the broadening of the coulomb peaks .",
    "we then get from eq .",
    "( [ eqanderson ] ) @xmath133 for our finite system @xmath134 , which means that we obtain a peak at @xmath105 of height @xmath135 . for well - behaved systems @xmath136 @xcite , which is true for the exact solution of the anderson model . in our numerics",
    ", however , the polynomial expansion broadens the self - energy , and thus our kondo peak height is smaller than the correct value of @xmath137@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "the coulomb blockade peaks are broadened by the order of @xmath138 , while the kondo peak is broadened less .",
    "this is due to the frequency dependence of @xmath139 ( @xmath140 has a small @xmath141dependence in this limit ) . by assuming that @xmath142 depends weakly on @xmath109 at the peak positions @xmath143 ( @xmath144 can be absorbed into @xmath138 without changing the conclusions ,",
    "also see figure [ fig : disconnected_resultsb ] ) , the full - width at half - maximum of the peaks is @xmath145 .    at the coulomb blockade peaks ,",
    "@xmath119 depend weakly on @xmath109 , giving fwhm @xmath146 .",
    "around @xmath105 , @xmath147 is much larger , reducing the fwhm .",
    "however , compared to the true width of the kondo peak , exponentially supressed as a function of @xmath148 @xcite , the implantation method yields a peak much too wide . in order to improve the description , @xmath119 should have a more negative slope at @xmath105 .",
    "we have indeed seen that the slope increases as a function of cluster size , hinting that the implantation method has the possibility of giving a sharp kondo peak .",
    "future studies will be done to reduce the artifical broadening from the polynomial expansion .",
    "we have seen that ( somewhat artificially ) using the same @xmath119 as before but using @xmath149 broadens the coulomb peaks with @xmath146 ( much bigger than the artifical smoothening ) , but does not affect the kondo peak width much .",
    "in this work , we have given an overview of the polynomial expansion algorithm and applied it to obtain spectral functions for single - impurity anderson systems with a high degree of symmetry . by making use of a unitary transformation ,",
    "the original system disconnects into a smaller interacting one , as well as several non - interacting chains . in systems fulfilling particle - hole symmetry ,",
    "the spectral function is symmetric ( @xmath150 ) , which simply means that the addition and removal parts of @xmath94 are identical .",
    "however , we found systems which are not particle - hole symmetric , yet still have a symmetric spectral function .",
    "this we explained by noting that in these cases , the reduced interacting cluster was particle - hole symmetric , showing a hidden symmetry for the spectral function",
    ".    by calculating the self - energy from an isolated system and implanting it into a transport setup , we obtained spectral functions for the anderson model .",
    "this can be seen as a perturbation expansion from an isolated system , but on the self - energy level .",
    "the implantation of an exact self - energy from a finite system yields a complex frequency dependent self - energy for the infinite system , which gives rise to highly non - trivial features in the spectral function , such as the coulomb peaks and the kondo peak .",
    "the frequency dependence of the self - energy led to an inhomogeneous broadening of the spectral peaks .",
    "the kondo peak was too broad compared to the exact solution , which we attribute to using a too small cluster in the calculation of the self - energy .",
    "we have seen that increasing the lead sizes gives a sharper kondo peak .",
