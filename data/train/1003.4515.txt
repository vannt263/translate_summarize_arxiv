    "the formation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) has been postulated in many theories of the early universe ( for a recent review see ref .  ) .",
    "black holes of mass @xmath1 continually emit hawking radiation  @xcite with a temperature of @xmath2 in the form of all available fundamental particle species .",
    "the emitted particles decay quickly on astrophysical timescales into @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "pbhs with an initial mass@xcite of @xmath10 g should be expiring today with a burst of high energy particles including gamma - rays .",
    "the current upper limit on the number expiring today per volume per unit time is@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density enhancement of pbhs in the local region .",
    "typically @xmath12 is @xmath13 ( for clustering in the galactic halo ) or larger .",
    "such pbh bursts may be detectable by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope observatory s large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "conversely , non - detection by the lat may lead to tighter bounds on the pbh distribution .",
    "in the standard model@xcite , the total number of photons emitted per second by a @xmath14 gev black hole scales as@xcite @xmath15 the number of photons per second per unit area reaching the earth from a pbh bursting at a distance @xmath16 from the earth is @xmath17 let us assume an ideal detector of effective area @xmath18 which can detect every photon that falls on it .",
    "( if the detector is non - ideal then the efficiency can be incorprated into the value of @xmath18 . ) if the detector requires @xmath19 photons over time @xmath20 to distinguish an incoming event as a burst , then to detect a burst we require @xmath21 .",
    "that is the pbh must be closer than @xmath22 what @xmath23 maximizes the chance of detection ?",
    "the remaining lifetime@xcite of a pbh of temperature @xmath23 is @xmath24 s where @xmath25 weights the number of emitted species .",
    "( the remaining lifetime of a 300 gev , 1 tev , or 5 tev black hole is 1 hour , 1 minute , or 1 second , respectively . )",
    "taking @xmath26 , a pbh will be detected by the ideal detector if it is closer than @xmath27 thus the detectability is maximized for the lowest @xmath23 black hole visible above the background and/or by using the longest detector exposure time . for a detector of angular resolution @xmath28 to resolve the pbh above the gamma - ray background @xmath29",
    ", we also require that @xmath30 .",
    "the pbh will be resolved above the observed ( egret ) extragalactic background@xcite @xmath31 at energy @xmath32 by the ideal detector if the pbh is closer than @xmath33 and @xmath32 is less than the average energy@xcite of the pbh photons @xmath34 gev . the isotropic diffuse gamma - ray background , which is an upper limit on the extragalactic background , recently measured@xcite by the lat at mid - galactic latitudes is consistent with the earlier egret measurements eq . ( [ aba : eq6 ] ) ,",
    "although the extragalactic component may@xcite be weaker by up to a factor of 2 .    for a given detector , the scanned volume of space is then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the detector acceptance angle ( field of view ) and @xmath37 .",
    "extensive air shower arrays characteristically have @xmath38 , large @xmath36 and small @xmath28 but very high threshold energy ( typically @xmath39 tev ) and hence are background - limited , while atmospheric cerenkov detectors@xcite characteristically have @xmath40 and small @xmath28 but high threshold energy ( typically @xmath41 gev although the whipple sgarface system@xcite has a threshold of 100 mev ) and very small @xmath36 ( @xmath42 sr ) .",
    "in contrast , the fermi lat has@xcite a smaller @xmath43 but large @xmath44 sr , finer source position angular resolution ( @xmath45 ) , low energy thresholds ( down to 20 mev ) , good time resolution and is essentially background - free with respect to burst sensitivity .",
    "additionally , most of the photons emitted by expiring @xmath46 tev pbhs are in the lat energy range ( 20 mev - 300 gev ) .",
    "the fermi lat offers greater sensitivity to local pbh bursts than ground - based detectors .",
    "we have proposed@xcite spectral lag measurements ( the temporal delay between high and low energy pulses ) of the incoming light curve in two different energy bands as a method to identify pbh bursts .",
    "a pbh burst arriving at the detector will exhibit positive to negative evolution with increasing energy because the black hole temperature and @xmath47 increase over time as the black hole loses mass .",
    "because spectral lag measurements require counts in only two energy bands , and not the full spectrum , spectral lag can be measured even for weak events that last for very short time scales .",
    "work is in progress to calculate quantitative values for the pbh spectral lags for the characteristics of the fermi lat .",
