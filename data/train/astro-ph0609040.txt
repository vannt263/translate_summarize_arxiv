    ". it would certainly be unwise to build a strong bias like @xmath9 into our analysis tools as long as experiments do not rule it out . in this paper",
    "we consider the evolution of the perturbations for models where @xmath10 crosses @xmath11 .",
    "we find that in many realistic cases the divergencies are only apparent and can be avoided . at the level of cosmological first order perturbation theory , there is no fundamental limitation that prevents an effective fluid from crossing the phantom divide .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we start with a short recapitulation of the first order perturbations in fluids , which also serves to define our notation . in section iii",
    "we study the behaviour of barotropic fluids close to @xmath0 , concluding that this class of fluids can not cross the phantom divide self - consistently .",
    "we allow for non - adiabatic perturbations in section iv and show that the phantom divide can now be crossed as long as we define the pressure perturbation in a frame that stays physical .",

    "the only acceptable case is the last one , but as discussed at the beginning of this section , we expect the system to get stuck at @xmath8 and to never cross .",
    "barotropic perfect fluids therefore fail to cross either at the background or perturbation level . even if the fluctuations can lead to a crossing with zero slope due to the instability of the cosmological constant solution in some cases , the model is still not realistic .",
    "the perturbations seem to propagate acausally , and generically after the transition @xmath101 for a period , leading to classical instabilities with exponential growth of the perturbations . in the next section",
    "we will relax the barotropic assumption , which allows for entropy perturbations that can stabilise the system and keep the sound speed below the speed of light .",
    "the discussion of the barotropic fluid shows that we have to violate the constraint that @xmath20 be a function of @xmath19 alone . at the level of first order perturbation theory ,",
    "this amounts to changing the prescription for @xmath1 which now becomes an arbitrary function of @xmath102 and @xmath13 .",
    "this problem is conceptually similar to choosing the background pressure @xmath103 , where the conventional solution is to compare the pressure with the energy density by setting @xmath104 . in this way we avoid having to deal with a dimensionfull quantity and",
    "can instead set @xmath10 , which has no units ( up to a factor of the speed of light ) and so is generically of order unity and often has a simple form , like @xmath105 for a radiation fluid or @xmath8 for a cosmological constant .",
    "it certainly makes sense to try a similar approach for the pressure perturbation . however , there are two relevant variables that we could compare @xmath1 to , the fluid velocity @xmath42 and the perturbation in the energy density @xmath28",
    ". clearly it would be counterproductive to replace a single free function by two free functions , and it would lead to degeneracies between the two .",
    "another problem is that the perturbation variables depend on the gauge choice .",
    "but in this case the two problems cancel each other , leading to a simpler solution : going to the rest - frame of the fluid both fixes the gauge and renders the fluid velocity physically irrelevant , so that we can now write @xcite : = _ s^2 , [ eq : csrest ] where a hat denotes quantities in the rest - frame .",
    "the physical interpretation is that @xmath106 is the speed with which fluctuations in the fluid propagate , ie .",
    "the sound speed .",
    "again , some physical models lead to simple prescriptions for the sound speed .",
    "the barotropic models discussed in the last section have @xmath107 , and the perturbations in a scalar field correspond ( to linear order ) exactly to those of a fluid with @xmath108 .",
    "the rest - frame is chosen so that the energy - momentum tensor looks diagonal to an observer in this frame . in terms of the gauge transformations",
    "this amounts to choosing @xmath109 .",
    "however , we notice immediately a potential flaw in this prescription close to @xmath8 : the off - diagonal entries of the energy - momentum tensor are actually @xmath110 so that demanding @xmath111 is a stronger condition than required . in other words ,",
    "the condition to be at rest with respect to the flow of @xmath112 can not be maintained at @xmath113 .",
    "however , as @xmath114 , we could define instead the sound speed in a frame where there is no flow of energy density .    to see this ,",
    "let us calculate the pressure perturbation defined by eq .",

    "even though the effective sound speed @xmath144 in eq .",

    "this behaviour , which looks extremely fine - tuned , is automatically enforced in this model .",
    "such a cancellation mechanism is required for any model in order to cross @xmath8 .",
    "we also see that although the effective sound speed remains simply @xmath136 , this is only true if we know that there are internal relative and non - adiabatic pressure perturbations ( as well as their form ) .",
    "but in general we would try to parametrise the pressure perturbation as : p_= c_x^2 _",

    "[ eq : cx ] where the apparent sound speed @xmath148 is now a mixture of the real effective sound speed together with the relative and the non - adiabatic pressure perturbations . in this case",

    "[ fig : quint_cs ] we plot @xmath148 as a function of the equation of state parameter @xmath10 for several wave vectors @xmath102 .",
    "as predicted , the apparent rest - frame sound speed diverges at the crossing . in the quintom case",
    "the effective perturbations do not vanish at @xmath8 .",
    "we think that the lessons learned from the quintom model are applicable also to more general models with multiple fields , non - minimally coupled scalar fields , brane - world models and other modified gravity models that can be represented by an effective dark energy fluid . in all these models , as in the quintom case",
    ", @xmath149 is not a special point in their evolution .",
    "there is no reason to expect that the model will adjust its behaviour at this point , as the crossing of the phantom divide is incidential . in representing these kinds of models with an effective fluid",
    "we therefore expect that the perturbations will not vanish , and that the apparent sound speed would have to diverge .",
    "one important difference between the quintom model and more general modified gravity models is that the latter seem to require generically a non - zero anisotropic stress as @xmath150 @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath124 does not allow crossing the phantom divide , since @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_cross ] ) contains an additional non - zero term due to the anisotropic stress .",
    "this reinforces our view that the quintom - like crossing , where all perturbations stay non - zero and @xmath140 remains finite in spite of divergences in most conventionally expected terms , is more generic .",
    "this means that there is no obvious way to predict the form of @xmath140 in general for modified gravity models . on the positive side",
    ", if the dark energy is not just a cosmological constant , and if we are able to measure @xmath140 then we may hope that this will provide us with clues about the physical mechanism that is causing the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "as long as the cosmological data indicates the presence of a dark energy with an effective equation of state @xmath2 it will be necessary to consider models with the same equation of state .",
    "in general , we will have to allow the equation of state to cross the phantom divide , @xmath8 . even though such a fluid model may not be viable at the quantum level",
    ", it is possible that this behaviour is only apparent , or due to a modification of general relativity or the existence of more spatial dimensions . in analysing the data we therefore have to be able to use general self - consistent models at the level of linear perturbation theory .    in this paper",
    "we have studied the behaviour of the perturbations in general perfect fluid models close to @xmath8 .",
    "we have shown that although models with purely adiabatic perturbations can not cross @xmath8 without violating important physical constraints ( like causality or smallness of the perturbations ) , it is possible to rectify the situation by allowing for non - adiabatic sources of pressure perturbations .",
    "however , the parametrisation of @xmath1 in terms of the rest - frame perturbations of the energy density can not be used as this frame becomes unphysical at @xmath8 . by parameterising @xmath1 instead in any other frame",
    "the divergencies are avoided .",
    "we also computed all quantities in the quintom model which provides an explicit example of the above mechanism . in this model , even though the propagation speed of sound waves remains finite and constant , the additional internal and relative pressure perturbations lead to an apparent sound speed which diverges .",
    "it is only the sum of all contributions to @xmath1 which remains finite .",
    "a more speculative conclusion is that it seems difficult for `` fundamental '' fields to cross @xmath8 as their apparent rest - frame sound speed , defined through eq .",
    "( [ eq : csrest ] ) , would generally be the actual propagation speed of their perturbations , which must remain smaller than the speed of light . from the discussion in section [ sec : non_ad ] we learn that fields with a well defined rest - frame and sound speed have only two routes to phantom crossing :    * _ @xmath151 at crossing : _ this looks rather fine - tuned as the field needs to be aware of the presence of the barrier .",
    "on the other hand , a normal minimally coupled scalar field reaches @xmath8 when @xmath152 , and it does so with zero slope . a scenario where phantom crossing of this kind is realised",
    "could be built by changing the sign in front of the kinetic term whenever @xmath152 .",
    "as an example , a cosine potential then leads to a `` phaxion '' scenario , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phaxion ] . on average",
    ", the phaxion behaves like a cosmological constant , but oscillates around @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is unclear how to construct such a scenario in a covariant way . *",
    "_ vanishing sound speed : _ a field with a vanishing sound speed can also avoid the logarithmic divergence of @xmath1 .",
    "this requires either a coupling between @xmath93 and @xmath120 or else the sound speed might be zero at all times , see fig .",
    "[ fig_cs0 ] . in the latter case",
    "the pressure of the field would need to remain close to @xmath153 at all times in order to prevent the small - scale perturbations from growing too quickly .",
    "also , the sound speeds needs to be _ exactly _ zero , otherwise the logarithmic divergence reappears .",
    "this may require a symmetry enforcing @xmath124 as even a very small but non - zero sound speed would render this scenario inviable .    in view of these difficulties , the quintom family of models , although more complicated than a single field , may prove to be the conceptually simplest way to cross @xmath8 with a model defined through an action .",
    "they also illustrate that the effective pressure perturbation may provide a kind of fingerprint of the mechanism behind the accelerated expansion of the universe if it can be measured .    concerning the use of phantom - crossing fluids for the purpose of data analysis , it is straightforward to implement them by just avoiding the usual parametrisation of the pressure perturbations in terms of the rest - frame sound speed .",
    "however , there does not seem to be a canonical way to choose the pressure perturbations if one is not allowed to use the dark energy rest - frame .",
    "the aim for the far future will be to directly measure the pressure perturbations of the dark energy in order to gain insight into the physical origin of the phenomenon . for now , we have to ensure that the definition of @xmath1 does not lead to unphysical situations , while preserving the usual parametrisation in terms of the rest - frame sound speed as much as possible far away from the phantom divide .",
    "maybe the simplest way out is to regularise the adiabatic sound speed @xmath82 which appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp_rest ] ) because of the gauge transformation into the rest - frame . while any finite choice of @xmath1 is a physically acceptable choice , it is preferable to modify eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp_rest ] ) in a minimal way so that the usual interpretation of @xmath120 is preserved for @xmath52 .",
    "we propose to use _",

    "look important , we have to remember that , firstly , the perturbations in the dark energy are normally small ( especially close to the phantom divide ) and that secondly they are only communicated to the other fluids via the gravitational potential @xmath31 . as in fig .  [ fig-2b ]",
    ", we find also here that the dark energy perturbations are subdominant . computing the cmb power spectrum for @xmath155 and @xmath156 we find a relative difference in the @xmath157 of less than 1% on large scales , which rapidly drops to @xmath158 by @xmath159 , well below cosmic variance .",
