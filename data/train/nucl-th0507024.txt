    "while most of our knowledge of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 baryons has come from @xmath4n elastic scattering and photoproduction , the @xmath1n channel has been crucial in determinations of the @xmath2 properties . in @xmath4n elastic scattering ,",
    "this resonance signal is masked by a sharp cusp due to the opening @xmath1n channel , while in the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath7 , the @xmath2 is associated with a rapidly increasing cross section near threshold . as a result , the incorporation of eta - production data in multi - channel fits has allowed more reliable determinations of the @xmath2 resonance parameters .    the nearby @xmath3 resonance , while not strongly coupled to the @xmath1n channel , gives an important contribution to some eta - production observables through interference effects .",
    "the particle data group  @xcite estimates the ratio @xmath8 to be 0.0023@xmath90.0004 , a value determined mainly by the multi - channel analysis of penner and mosel  @xcite . in @xmath0 , the effect of this resonance is visible in the departure from purely s - wave behavior with increasing energy .",
    "while the @xmath3 contribution is small , the effect is magnified through s - d wave interference with the dominant @xmath2 contribution . in @xmath10 photoproduction , this interference effect is particularly evident in measurements with a polarized beam ( @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1n interaction has also been studied extensively due to a strong attraction at low energies , observed in most analyses , which could possibly lead to the existence of bound state @xmath1-mesic nuclei @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath10 scattering length can not be measured directly . instead , cross sections for @xmath1 meson production , @xmath0 and @xmath12 ,",
    "have been studied  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated that the real part of the scattering length can not be extracted directly from the low - energy eta - production cross sections and a model analysis is needed .",
    "previous analyses  @xcite have found a large spread for the real part , from a negative value @xcite to 1  fm @xcite ( table  [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "reasons for the spread include the rather old and conflicting @xmath1 meson production data and differing @xmath13 elastic scattering amplitudes from the karlsruhe  @xcite and said  @xcite groups",
    ". however , the largest factor appears to be the model used in analyzing the data .    in recent years",
    ", the eta - production database has seen significant improvements . in this paper",
    ", we present the results from analyses of these new data .",
    "the most recent data for the reaction @xmath14 are described in section  [ sec : exp ] . in section  [ sec : ca ] , we described the formalism associated with our fits .",
    "results and comparisons with previous determinations are tabulated in section  [ sec : andi ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our findings and consider the open questions which will require further work .",
    "until recently , the @xmath0 cross section database contained mainly old and often conflicting measurements ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , with no polarized measurements existing below 1.1  gev / c  @xcite .",
    "these older data have been reviewed by clajus and nefkens  @xcite .",
    "more recently , differential and total cross sections for @xmath0 near threshold have been measured using the bnl - ags facility ( e909 )  @xcite .",
    "data were obtained from threshold ( @xmath15 = 684.5  mev/@xmath16 ) to @xmath17770  mev/@xmath16 .",
    "the most recent @xmath0 experiment was also performed at bnl , but in this case , using the crystal ball spectrometer ( now moved to mami at mainz ) .",
    "cross sections were measured from threshold to 747  mev/@xmath16 ( e913/914 )  @xcite .",
    "the total and differential cross sections from these two bnl measurements are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1 ] .",
    "normalization issues still remain for the differential cross sections .",
    "however , the crystal ball distributions show a much smoother variation and a clear onset of higher partial - wave contributions with increasing energy . this feature , which is a vast improvement over previous measurements , allows an improved separation of the @xmath3 contribution .",
    "traditionally , the total cross - section is plotted as a function of the pion laboratory energy [ fig  [ fig : a1](h ) ] .",
    "this view shows the sharp growth above threshold which is usually attributed to the dominance of the @xmath2 resonance , having a mass close to the @xmath1 production threshold ( @xmath18 = 1487  mev ) and a strong coupling to the @xmath10 system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] , we instead plot the total cross - section as a function of the @xmath1 cm momentum @xmath19 . from the figure , we see that data can be described very well by a linear fit ( dashed line ) .",
    "this is due to the @xmath20-wave dominance of the total cross section . from the slope of the best - fit line",
    ", a restriction on the imaginary part of the @xmath10 elastic scattering amplitude @xmath21 can be found .",
    "the optical theorem leads to @xmath22 as a result , we have @xmath23    using a linear fit , the recent e909 threshold data  @xcite give @xmath24 which can be compared with a previous output from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath25    it is commonly believed that the @xmath2 resonance dominates the @xmath1 production cross section .",
    "this resonance mechanism results in the imaginary part of the @xmath1 pion - production and the @xmath10 elastic scattering amplitudes being determined mainly by the @xmath2 resonance parameters .",
    "but this is not the case for the real part .",
    "the real part of the resonance amplitude goes to zero at the resonance position .",
    "therefore , the real part of the @xmath10 scattering length strongly depends on nonresonant processes . for this reason ,",
    "a multichannel analysis is favored in determining the @xmath10 scattering length .",
    "our approach is described in the next section .",
    "our energy - dependent partial - wave fits are parametrized in terms of a coupled - channel chew - mandelstam k matrix , as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this choice determines the way we modify energy dependence and account for unitarity in our fits .",
    "data for @xmath13 elastic scattering have been fitted up to 2.1  gev in the pion lab kinetic energy .",
    "data for the reaction @xmath0 have been included from threshold up to 0.8  gev .",
    "constraint data have also been included , in order to ensure that the resulting fit produces elastic @xmath13 amplitudes satisfying a set of forward and fixed - t dispersion - relations .",
    "this fit to data plus constraints must be iterated until a stable result is obtained  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have included @xmath27 and @xmath28 channels to account for unitarity , but have not explicitly fitted data of this type .",
    "the @xmath2 resonance couples mainly to @xmath13 and @xmath10 , with a much smaller branching fraction to @xmath29 , and our results were not sensitive to the choice of additional channels . for the @xmath3 , however , there is a substantial inelastic branching to @xmath29 , split mainly between @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "we therefore considered two different fits having ( a ) approximately equal @xmath28 and @xmath30 branching fractions , and ( b ) a larger @xmath28 branching fraction . while this choice had little effect on the total width , it significantly changed the branching to @xmath10 .    in order to extract resonance parameters from our global fits ,",
    "we have generally extrapolated into the complex energy plane to search for poles .",
    "we have also fitted our energy - dependent and single - energy partial - wave amplitudes with breit - wigner plus background forms .",
    "here we have chosen to fit the partial waves containing the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances in terms of a k - matrix resonance form , allowing for 2 poles in the @xmath31 partial wave , plus background .",
    "this revised parametrization was then fitted directly to the data ( from 400 to 900  mev in the pion kinetic energy ) in order to determine resonance parameters .",
    "the remaining partial waves were fixed to values determined from a previous global ( energy - dependent ) fit .",
    "this resulted in error estimates more directly tied to the data .",
    "the general form used for the modified ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) partial waves was @xmath33 with @xmath34 giving the phase space for a channel ( @xmath13 , @xmath30 , @xmath28 , or @xmath10 ) , and with @xmath35 represented in terms of a k - matrix as @xmath36 where , in a two - resonance case , we have fitted @xmath37 the background has been parametrized in terms of the phase space , @xmath38 = @xmath39 , with @xmath40 elements assumed constant over the limited energy ranges of these fits .",
    "the k - matrix pole residues were similarly parametrized as @xmath41 = @xmath42 with @xmath43 = @xmath44 .",
    "the phase phase factors were normalized to unity at the resonance position @xmath45 .",
    "results for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath13 elastic scattering amplitudes are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : a3 ] . here",
    "the result of our most recently published fit ( fa02 ) is compared to an updated and improved version ( g380 ) .",
    "the k - matrix fits closely follow the g380 result and have not been plotted .",
    "[ fig : a4 ] shows the much larger deviations existing between different versions of the @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "our results from four fits , two with and two without the recent crystal ball data , are summarized in tables  [ tbl2],[tbl3 ] . listed",
    "are the partial widths for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances .",
    "while the pdg quotes  @xcite a broad and conservative range of about 30 to 50 percent for both the @xmath13 and @xmath10 branching ratios corresponding to the @xmath2 , most recent determinations have found the @xmath10 fraction to be about 50% , the remaining 50% divided between the @xmath13 and @xmath29 channels .",
    "we have similarly found @xmath10 branching fractions exceeding the @xmath13 fraction in all of our fits .",
    "the @xmath2 total width , found in the k - matrix fits , differs significantly from our previously published result  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the coupled - channel k - matrix form more than a qualitative difference in the partial - wave amplitudes .",
    "we note that coupled - channel fits have in the past  @xcite found the n(1535 ) width to be about half the 200 mev obtained in single - channel fits to eta photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "the extracted @xmath3 @xmath10 branching fraction is very small , as was expected .",
    "penner and mosel  @xcite found 0.0023@xmath90.0004 for this ratio using an older version of our @xmath13 amplitudes as a representation of the @xmath13 elastic scattering database . a somewhat smaller value , 0.0008@xmath90.0001 was found in a mainz analysis of eta photoproduction data  @xcite .",
    "we find this quantity to be rather sensitive to model details , but our range of values effectively spans the two previous determinations . fits  a and c have included the crystal ball data , and result in more precisely determined @xmath10 branching fractions , as expected . in fits",
    "b and d , the crystal ball data were excluded .",
    "different @xmath28 and @xmath30 branching fractions ( fits a and b versus c and d ) were obtained through the choice of contributions to the background .",
    "the background k - matrix contains elements coupling , for example , @xmath46 , which can not be measured and are therefore intrinsically model - dependent .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tbl1 ] , previous determinations of the @xmath10 scattering length have produced widely varying results .",
    "this should not be surprising , as these determinations require the threshold behavior of an amplitude that can not be directly measured . somewhat surprising to us , however , was the relative stability of scattering lengths found from our set of four k - matrix fits , with and without the crystal ball data , which are shown in table  [ tbl4 ] .",
    "these results are comparable to those found in a fit by green and wycech  @xcite , who used a similar k - matrix representation for the s - wave amplitudes , and the multi - channel fits of penner and mosel  @xcite . if , however , we determine the @xmath10 scattering length directly from our global fit , based on a chew - mandlestam k - matrix formalism , a very different result is found .",
    "this value seems more compatible with the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    ", we can confirm previous determinations within similar approaches , but caution that ( for the real part in particular ) the employed model may be more important than improvements in the fitted data .",
    "the s - wave @xmath47 elastic partial waves , from g380 and fit  a , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : a5 ] .",
    "we have explored the model and data dependence of @xmath10 couplings to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances , and have extracted the @xmath10 scattering length .",
    "our values for these quantities are in reasonable agreement with previous determinations .",
    "one notable difference in our method has been the direct fit to data , rather than to amplitudes .",
    "this has allowed a direct @xmath48 comparison of the fits .    from an experimental point of view , several issues remain to be resolved .",
    "the recent crystal ball measurements of @xmath26 , covering a region from threshold to the peak of the @xmath2 resonance , have suggested a slightly lower mass and width for this state .",
    "this could have been verified with measurements continuing to higher energies .",
    "however , with the crystal ball moved to mainz , this is no longer possible .",
    "the standard value  @xcite ( 547.75@xmath90.12  mev ) of the @xmath1 mass has also shifted recently , and this naturally effects extrapolations associated with the scattering length determination . the linear plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] has taken 547.3  mev for the eta meson mass .",
    "we have allowed the eta mass to vary between 547 and 548  mev , finding very little sensitivity in our fits .",
    "we should also note that a recent measurement from the gem collaboration  @xcite finds a value close to the previous  standard \" mass of 547.3  mev .",
    "given the model dependence found in our determinations , it would be interesting to see the effect of the crystal ball data in multi - channel fits which include representations of the @xmath49 data . also of interest would be a re - examination of the @xmath3 @xmath47 branching fraction as extracted from eta - photoproduction data . the quality and quantity of data for this reaction",
    "has increased since the mainz analysis  @xcite .",
