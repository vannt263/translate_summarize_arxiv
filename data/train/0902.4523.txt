    "in contrast to a classical critical point , for a quantum critical point the dynamical behavior is coupled to the static properties via the dynamical critical exponent @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath92 where @xmath93 describes the characteristic time scale close to the critical point . here",

    "nevertheless , the dimensionality can not unambiguously assigned , although there is a better agreement for the one dimensional case . here",
    "the exponent is dominated by the variation in density , which scales to the @xmath134 power . in future experiments it might be possible to create better defined dimensionality by adjusting the shape of the atomic cloud and/or the strength of the interaction by choosing adequate rydberg states .",
    "in summary we have shown that the experimental results presented in @xcite can be described with universal scaling theories .",
    "this result confirms that the description with the effective spin hamiltonian given in this article is correct to a large extent .",
    "therefore the observation of a quantum critical point in this system should be within experimental reach .",
    "this could be done by measuring the excited rydberg fraction when approaching the quantum critical point adiabatically starting from a non - critical region in the @xmath135 parameter space .",
    "another way would be the observation of a crystalline correlation function of the excited rydberg atoms by either a spatial dependent observation of the rydberg atoms or in the fourier space by a laue diffraction experiment with a four wave mixing technique @xcite . the measurement of the critical exponent is not in complete accordance with a one dimensional or three dimensional situation , which is most likely due to finite size effects .",
    "the general form of the scaling exponents allows also to apply the simple model to dipolar systems , which are widely realized in frozen rydberg gases and are also feasible in the context of ultra - cold dipolar molecules @xcite .",
