    ", the elemental abundance patterns of hyper - metal - poor stars well match the yields by supernova explosions with a progenitor mass of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this implies that pop iii stars of some @xmath4 are likely to have formed before the first metal enrichment .",
    "metal - free first objects are expected to collapse at @xmath6 , forming a minihalo with the mass of @xmath7 and the extent of @xmath8pc @xcite . in the course of bottom - up structure formation , such minihaloes",
    "merge to form first galaxies at @xmath9 , having virial temperature @xmath10k and mass @xmath11 . even in the evolution of first galaxies ,",
    "pop iii stars can play a significant role , since an appreciable number of stars can form from metal - free component in interstellar gas @xcite .",
    "also , those pop iii stars are likely to be responsible for the reionization of the universe @xcite , and the metal enrichment of intergalactic medium @xcite through supernova ( sn ) explosions @xcite .",
    "hence , the mass range of pop iii stars affects the galaxy formation and the evolution of intergalactic matter .",
    "if first stars are very massive , they emit intensive ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation , which significantly influences the subsequent star formation in minihaloes or first galaxies @xcite . in a pop iii minihalo ,",
    "primordial fluctuations generate density peaks owing to gravitational instability induced by h@xmath0 cooling . a highest peak collapses earlier to form a first pop iii star as shown by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , lower peaks collapse to form cloud cores with the density of @xmath12@xmath13 and the temperature of @xmath14k @xcite .",

    "low temperature collapsing clouds in first galaxies could be subject to the uv feedback by pop iii stars .",
    "if a first star is distant by more than 1pc , dense clouds are readily self - shielded from the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation @xcite .",
    "thus , the photoevaporation by uv heating is unlikely to work devastatingly .",
    "however , lyman - werner ( lw ) band radiation ( 11.18 - 13.6ev ) photodissociates h@xmath0 molecules , and therefore can preclude a cloud core from collapsing . hence , the photodissociation of h@xmath0 may lead to momentous negative feedback @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed 3d radiation hydrodynamic simulations on the photodissociation feedback , and derived the criteria of the feedback .",
    "however , ionizing radiation ( @xmath1713.6ev ) is related to h@xmath0 formation in an intricate fashion . an ionization front ( i - front ) driven by ionizing radiation propagates in a collapsing core .",
    "the enhanced fraction of electrons catalyzes rapid h@xmath0 formation @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mild ionization ahead of the i - front can generate an h@xmath0 shell , which potentially shields h@xmath0 dissociating photons @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is likely to work positively to form pop iii stars . when uv irradiates a dense core , the i - front changes from r - type on the surface to d - type inside the core .",
    "the transition occurs via an intermediate type ( m - type ) , which is accompanied with the generation of shock @xcite .",
    "the shock can affect significantly the collapse of the core .",
    "this is a totally radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) process .",
    "such radiation hydrodynamic feedback has been investigated by 1d spherical rhd simulations @xcite , 2d cylindrical rhd simulations @xcite , and 3d rhd simulations @xcite .",
    "the results by 2d and 3d simulations are in good agreement with each other . however , quantitative feedback effects , including the compression and stripping by a shock , have not been explored yet over a wide parameter range in 3d simulations .    in this paper",

    ", we solve the three - dimensional rhd in a wide range of parameter space .",

    "we briefly summarize the scheme .",
    "the code is designed to investigate the formation and evolution of the first - generation objects at @xmath9 , where the radiative feedback from various sources plays important roles .",
    "the code can compute the fraction of the chemical species e@xmath18 , h@xmath19 , h , h@xmath18 , h@xmath0 , and h@xmath20 through fully implicit time integration .",
    "it also can deal with multiple sources of ionizing radiation , as well as the radiation at the lyman - werner band .",
    "although there may be heavy elements in first galaxies through pop iii supernova explosions therein , the metallic cooling is not dominant as long as the metallicity is lower than @xmath21 @xcite . in this paper , we ignore the metallic cooling .",
    "the hydrodynamics is calculated by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method .",
    "we use the version of sph by @xcite , with the modification according to @xcite .",
    "we adopt the particle resizing formalism by @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium chemistry and radiative cooling for primordial gas are calculated with the code developed by @xcite , where the h@xmath0 cooling and reaction rates are mostly taken from @xcite . as for the photoionization process",
    ", we employ the so - called on - the - spot approximation @xcite , where it is assumed that recombination photons to ground states of hydrogen are absorbed promptly on the spot , while recombination photons to excited states can escape the medium . in the present version of our code",
    ", we do not take into account helium ionization .",
    "for pure hydrogen gas with on - the - spot approximation , we do not need the frequency bins for the radiation field .",
    "all we need is the optical depth at lyman limit , since we know the frequency dependence of the optical depth .",
    "we can obtain the `` precise '' photoionization rate or photoheating rate as functions of the optical depth at lyman limit before we start simulations @xcite .",
    "we also remark that in case we include helium , we need more frequencies@xcite .    the optical depth is integrated using the neighbor lists of sph particles .",
    "it is similar to the code described in @xcite , but now we can deal with multiple point sources . in our new scheme ,",
    "we do not create as many grid points on the light ray as the previous code @xcite does .",
    "instead , we just create one grid point per sph particle located in its neighbor .",
    "we find the `` upstream '' particle for each sph particle on its line of sight to the source .",
    "then the optical depth from the source to the sph particle is obtained by summing up the optical depth at the `` upstream '' particle and the differential optical depth between the two particles .",
    "the opacity against lw - band flux ( @xmath22 ) is calculated with the self - shielding function by @xcite , which is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the incident flux , @xmath25 is the normalized h@xmath0 column density , and @xmath26 the column density of h@xmath0 is evaluated by the method described above .",
    "we assume the same absorption for the photons within the lw - band between 11.26 and 13.6 ev .",
    "the use of the self - shielding function ignores the effects of doppler shifts of lw lines .",
    "if the line is shifted more than thermal broadening width , the opacity at lw band is greatly reduced . in the present calculations",

    "thus , the infall velocity in the envelope of cloud is as large as the sound velocity .",
    "moreover , the velocity around the core is much smaller than sound velocity .",
    "therefore , we do not include this effect in the present simulations .",
    "the code is already parallelized with the mpi library .",

    "we suppose a primordial gas cloud undergoing run - away collapse nearby a preformed massive star .",
    "dark matter is neglected in the present calculations , because we are interested in rather dense cores with @xmath28 that start to become baryon - dominated ( e.g. abel , bryan & norman 2002 ) .",
    "the tidal field from other halos could have some effects on the dynamics of collapsing gas , which is not taken into account in the present calculation .",

    "[ nofeedback ] , the cloud collapse in two cases is shown by temperature versus density at the center . in a ltc model , the relatively high initial temperature ( @xmath36k ) allows the efficient formation of h@xmath0 molecules and also leads to the relatively slow gravitational contraction . in this model ,",
    "the ratio between gravitational energy to initial thermal energy @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , the core temperature goes down quickly to @xmath38k at the density @xmath39 . since the size of core is approximately the jeans length , a smaller core forms in a ltc model .",
    "it is worth noting that the density distribution of collapsing gas for @xmath40 is close to the one obtained in cosmological simulations including dark matter gravity @xcite . in an htc model ,",
    "the formation of h@xmath0 molecules is not so rapid owing to the lower initial temperature ( @xmath41k ) .",
    "also , the initial low pressure ( @xmath42 ) allows the rapid gravitational contraction .",

    "then , owing to the inefficiency of h@xmath0 cooling , the gravitational contraction becomes adiabatic and temperature rises until 1myr ( left panels ) . during the adiabatic contraction , h@xmath0 molecules retrieve , since the h@xmath0 formation rate is raised in adiabatically heated cores .    in htc - ion model , the heating by a shock associated with an ionization front helps to increase the temperature . as a result , the h@xmath0 formation is restored and h@xmath0 fraction exceeds @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the core can cool and keep collapsing . in ltc - lw , and htc - lw models ,",
    "the h@xmath0 abundance drops down to a level lower than @xmath48 after uv irradiation , and the temperature continues to increase owing to insufficient cooling .",
    "although h@xmath0 formation is recovered , h@xmath0 fractions are not sufficient for the cloud to keep collapsing .",

    "the physical processes are more complicated .",
    "the shock heating before 1myr works importantly to restore h@xmath0 formation .",
    "resultantly , the h@xmath0 abundance reaches to a level of @xmath49 .",
    "however , the second hit by a diffracted shock between 1myr and 2myr ( the second peak in a red solid curve in the upper left panel in fig.[evolution ] ) raises the temperature quickly , so that the core can not be gravitationally bounded and bounces eventually . such intricate behavior of a shock is explained further in the following .",
    "ideally , it is appropriate to perform convergence check for all the models , however , we check for htc - ion model only , because of the limited computational time .",

    "if such lower - mass pop iii stars are formed , the radiation - hydrodynamic feedback on further star formation could be changed , since the importance of ionizing radiation relative to h@xmath0 dissociating radiation is different from that of a 120@xmath1 star .",
    "@xcite have investigated the dependence on the stellar mass of radiation - hydrodynamic feedback and concluded that the ionizing radiation from @xmath79 stars does not have significant impact on the neighboring star formation , but the feedback is essentially determined by h@xmath0 dissociating radiation , which causes only a negative effect .    in the present simulations",
    ", we omitted a few processes .",
    "first , we do not include the hd chemistry / cooing .",
    "it is well known that hd is an important coolant in case once the gas is heated above @xmath15k . in that case , h@xmath0 cooling proceeds faster than the recombination of hydrogen atom at several thousand kelvin , leading to a large h@xmath0 fraction , because of `` frozen '' electrons @xcite .",
    "hd molecules are formed from these abundant h@xmath0 molecules as the collapse of cloud proceeds(e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , hd cooling could be important when the ionized gas recollapses after the death of the source star .",
    "however , in the present simulations , the collapsing density peaks do not experience such a hot phase ( fig.[evolution ] ) , because of the self - shielding of the core .",
    "the shock associated to the i - front is also too mild to ionize the material ( again fig.[evolution ] ) .",
    "thus , as far as the collapse criteria of the core is concerned , hd cooling do not play an important role .",
    "secondly , we also do not include the h@xmath0-h@xmath19 collision - induced h@xmath0 cooling . according to @xcite , h@xmath0-h@xmath19 collision dominates the excitation of h@xmath0 in case electron fraction @xmath80 at @xmath81k , and @xmath82 at @xmath83k .",
    "these conditions are marginally satisfied when the gas cools down from ionized state .",
    "thus , h@xmath0-h@xmath19 collision - induced h@xmath0 cooling can play an important role , when the ionized gas recollapses after the source star turned off .",
    "however , again in our simulations , it is not so important , since the gas at the density peak is not ionized in its history .",
    "it is also worth noting that cooling and dynamics in the neighbor of h@xmath0 shell could be affected by these cooling process @xcite , however , it is unlikely that this effect changes the present results .",
    "we are grateful to all the collaborators in _ cosmological radiative transfer codes comparison project _ for fruitful discussions during the three workshops .",

    "<S> we explore the formation of secondary population iii ( pop iii ) stars under radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) feedback by a preformed massive star . to properly treat rhd feedback , we perform three - dimensional rhd simulations incorporating the radiative transfer of ionizing photons as well as h@xmath0 dissociating photons from a preformed star . </S>",
    "<S> a collapsing gas cloud is settled at a given distance from a 120@xmath1 pop iii star , and the evolution of the cloud is pursued including rhd feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the threshold density depending on the distance , above which the cloud can keep collapsing owing to the shielding of h@xmath0 dissociating radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that an h@xmath0 shell formed ahead of an ionizing front works effectively to shield the h@xmath0 dissociating radiation , leading to the positive feedback for the secondary pop iii star formation . also , near the threshold density , the envelope of gas cloud is stripped significantly by a shock associated with an ionizing front . by comparing the mass accretion timescale with the kelvin - helmholtz timescale , we estimate the mass of secondary pop iii stars . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the stripping by a shock can reduce the mass of secondary pop iii stars down to @xmath2 . </S>"
