    "besides growing interest from the fundamental physics of light and practical applications in photonics @xcite , two - dimensional optical microcavities have attracted much attention from the field of quantum / wave chaos , since they can be regarded as physical realization of dynamical billiards , a well - studied model in the field ( for reviews see for example refs .",
    "concepts of the quantum / wave chaos theory have been successfully applied to two - dimensional microcavities to explain how ray chaos influences the characteristics of resonant modes such as emission directionality and lifetimes .",
    "one of such applied concepts is _ dynamical tunneling _",
    "@xcite , which refers to tunneling between classical invariant components disconnected from each other under classical dynamics ( see ref .",

    "i.e. , those with mixed phase space , where regular and chaotic dynamics coexist , dynamical tunneling manifests itself in the fundamental processes such as regular - to - chaotic and chaotic - to - regular tunneling @xcite . one of the dramatic effects of dynamical tunneling is observed in the enhancement of level splitting of doublets associated with symmetry - related regular components separated by a global chaotic sea .",
    "the phenomenon is explained by the mechanism known as _ chaos - assisted tunneling _",
    "@xcite ; the regular components are coupled not only by direct regular - to - regular tunneling but also by a multi - step process involving regular - to - chaotic and chaotic - to - regular tunneling , and this process leads to a significant enhancement of the coupling .",
    "the dynamical tunneling and chaos - assisted tunneling have been experimentally observed in microwave billiards @xcite and cold atom systems @xcite .    in the context of optical microcavities , the effect of dynamical tunneling",
    "was already pointed out in the pioneering theoretical study of asymmetric resonant cavities @xcite , where the significant shortening of resonance lifetimes is attributed to dynamical tunneling .",
    "this effect was quantitatively studied by effective hamiltonian models @xcite , where a formula is derived describing how resonance lifetimes depend on the factors such as the area of regular components and wavenumber",
    ". strong influence of dynamical tunneling on the emission pattern of a ray - chaotic cavity was also pointed out in refs .",
    "resonance lifetimes were connected with a direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling rate in ref .",

    "recently , the manifestation of dynamical tunneling was experimentally observed in the emission patterns of semiconductor microlasers @xcite and the pump - coupling efficiency of dye - doped liquid jet microlasers @xcite . in the former study ,",
    "an asymmetric resonant cavity was designed to have quasi - one - dimensional modes strongly localized along a stable periodic ray orbit that is confined by total internal reflection ( tir ) . in the experiment ,",
    "such modes were excited by selective pumping , and highly directional emission was observed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive study on this microlaser .",
    "the emission directionality of this microlaser was interpreted by the following two steps : ( i ) dynamical tunneling from the tir - confined ray orbit to a neighboring chaotic ray orbit , and ( ii ) ray - dynamical propagation following the chaotic dynamics leading to refractive emission . in this paper",
    ", we shall call this process _ chaos - assisted emission _ in order to emphasize that the process is regular - to - chaotic - to - continuum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sect : cavity ] , we introduce the asymmetric resonant cavity and explain its ray dynamics , where particular attention is paid to the rectangle - shaped stable ray orbit confined by tir .",
    "section [ sect : rect - modes ] presents the numerical study of the resonant modes associated with this orbit ( rectangle - orbit modes , in short ) , showing that these quasi - one - dimensional modes exhibit chaos - assisted directional emission .",
    "section [ sect : device ] explains the device structure of fabricated semiconductor microlasers , especially focusing on the structure to achieve selective excitation of the rectangle - orbit modes .",
    "section [ sect : spectra ] provides measured spectral data that evidence the selective excitation .",
    "section [ sect : emission ] presents measured emission patterns which are attributed to the chaos - assisted emission .",
    "finally , our conclusion is given in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider the asymmetric resonant cavity whose shape is defined in the polar coordinates @xmath0 as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the size parameter and @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are deformation parameters fixed as @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the geometry of the cavity is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] ( a )",
    ". an important feature of this cavity is the existence of the 4-bounce stable ray orbit drawing the `` rectangle '' as shown in fig .",

    "the peculiarity of the rectangular orbit in relation with global ray dynamics is revealed by plotting the poincar surface of section ( psos ) of the ray dynamics .",
    "the psos describes the successive bounces of a ray trajectory usually using the birkhoff coordinates @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the arclength along the cavity and @xmath10 the incident angle as illustrated in fig .",

    "this value corresponds to the effective refractive index calculated for the structure of actually fabricated devices to be explained in sect .",

    "the critical line for total internal reflection , @xmath15 , is plotted by a dotted line .",
    "the four filled squares ( @xmath16 ) represent the rectangular orbit shown in ( b).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "resonant modes of the cavity are given as the solutions of the helmholtz equation derived from maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "they are quasibound states with finite lifetimes characterized by complex wavenumbers @xmath17 . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in quasi - one - dimensional modes strongly localized along the stable rectangular orbit .",
    "the existence of such modes can be proven in the short - wavelength limit by the so - called gaussian optics @xcite .",
    "this type of modes has been previously studied , for instance , for the so - called bow - tie laser @xcite , but an important difference here is that the corresponding ray orbit is confined by tir .",
    "thus , the ray optics based on fresnel s law as well as the gaussian optics predict that rectangle - orbit modes are perfectly confined , which is not true for accurate wave description . in order to correctly capture the emission patterns of the rectangle - orbit modes , below we resort to numerics .",
    "an accurate way for numerically calculating the modes is provided , for instance , by the boundary element method @xcite . in fig .",

    "the inset shows a magnification around the area where the unstable manifold overlaps with the critical line.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    these emissions are understood as the wave tunneling effect intrinsic to a ray - chaotic cavity .",
    "this emission mechanism is better explained by the psos than the real space .",
    "thus , we consider the psos - representation of an eigenfunction called the husimi distribution @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : husimi ] ( a ) shows the husimi distribution of the rectangle - orbit mode shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfunc ] ( a ) , where it is plotted in log scale to see exponentially small intensities in the area of the chaotic sea . in fig .",
    "[ fig : husimi ] ( a ) , the intensity increases as the color changes from black to white . reflecting the fact that the mode is localized along the rectangular orbit",
    ", we find high intensities on the corresponding islands .",
    "in addition , we find some intensities spread over the chaotic sea , even reaching down to the critical lines for tir , @xmath23 .",
    "the four high - intensity spots on the critical line labeled @xmath24 , and @xmath25 correspond to the four dominant emissions observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfunc ] ( b ) . together with the field intensity distribution in the real space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wfunc ] ( b ) ) , the husimi distribution reveals that emission occurs at two close but different boundary points ( one towards @xmath26 and the other towards @xmath27 ) on each side of the cavity .",
    "the emission pattern of the rectangle - orbit mode can be qualitatively explained in the following manner @xcite .",
    "although intensities are highly localized on the islands corresponding to the rectangular orbit , some intensities are leaked to their neighboring chaotic orbits via dynamical tunneling .",
    "once this happens , the leaked intensities are transported to the leaky region ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) by the chaotic dynamics , resulting in refractive emission .",
    "hence , it is the ray dynamics around the critical lines for tir that determines the emission pattern .",
    "in fact , such ray dynamics is governed by the unstable manifolds emanating from a short - periodic unstable periodic point located near the critical line @xcite . in fig . [",
    "fig : husimi ] ( b ) , we show how a ray ensemble initially prepared around the leftmost island is mapped to after 4 bounces .",
    "the initially circular area is stretched and folded after 4 bounces , partially penetrating into the region below the critical line as magnified in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : husimi ] ( b ) . as",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : husimi ] ( a ) , the high - intensity spot labeled @xmath4 coincides with the position where the unstable manifold crosses the critical line .",
    "the positions of the other high - intensity spots ( @xmath3 and @xmath25 ) are explained in the same manner .    in the remaining part of this paper , we study whether the theoretically predicted chaos - assisted emission from the rectangle - orbit modes can be experimentally observed .",
    "therefore , it is crucial in experiments to excite only the rectangle - orbit modes , suppressing the excitation of the other modes . in order to achieve this selective excitation",
    ", we employ the selective pumping method that has been previously examined for quasi - stadium - shaped microcavity lasers , where the selective excitation of two different types of modes , called the axis modes and ring modes , has been successfully demonstrated @xcite .",

    "for 100 ma , the spectrum shows equidistantly spaced peaks with the averaged mode spacing @xmath48 nm . considering the uncertainty of the refractive index and the resolution of the measurement , one can conclude that this value corresponds to the longitudinal mode spacing of the rectangle - orbit modes estimated as 0.63 nm .",

    "because currents are not injected around the rim of the cavity , the lasing of whispering - gallery - type modes is highly unlikely .",

    ", one can estimate their mode spacing as 0.56 nm , which is considerably smaller than the measured mode spacing .",

    "we also confirmed that the selective excitation is achieved with the intermediate and broad contact windows .",
    "figures [ fig : spectra.182and179 ] ( a ) and [ fig : spectra.182and179 ] ( b ) show spectra for the device with the intermediate contact window at 140 ma and for the device with the broad contact window at 80 ma , respectively . in both cases , one can confirm equidistantly spaced peaks .",
    "the average mode spacing is 0.67 nm in fig .",

    "these values are again in good agreement with the theoretical estimate 0.63 nm . as for the lasing threshold currents",
    ", we could not find significant dependence on the contact window patterns , i.e. , the threshold currents are around 50 ma irrespective of the contact window pattern .",
    "for microcavities with mostly or fully chaotic ray dynamics , it has been reported that experimental far - field patterns are well explained by ray - dynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "generally , some intrinsic deviation is observed between the far - field pattern of a _ single _ resonant mode and that of ray - dynamical calculation , especially in the short - wavelength regime @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it was demonstrated that the averaged far - field pattern of many resonant modes is very well reproduced by ray - dynamical calculation . because multi - mode lasing works as a mechanism to realize the `` average '' of many modes",
    ", one can expect that the correspondence between experimental data and ray - dynamical calculation becomes the better , the more the number of lasing modes increases .",
    "in fact , the validity of this expectation was confirmed for a stadium - shaped microlaser @xcite . in this section ,",

    "[ fig : ffp ] ( a ) and [ fig : ffp ] ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we note that these patterns are normalized after subtracting uniform background due to spontaneous emission . in good accordance with the theoretical prediction based on the chaos - assisted emission , we observe strong emissions towards @xmath53 .",

    "[ fig : ffp ] ( a ) and [ fig : ffp ] ( b ) , we superpose the theoretical far - field pattern obtained by ray - dynamical calculation .",
    "we find that the experimental far - field pattern for 500 ma is well reproduced by ray - dynamical calculation even for the substructures of the main peaks . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , wave calculation of the far - field pattern for a single mode does not show such substructures ( see fig . 5 of ref .",
    "therefore we conclude that the substructures of the main peaks in the measured far - field pattern are due to multimode lasing , because the far - field pattern for ray - dynamical calculation can be considered as that from an average of many modes as explained above .    for 100 ma ,",
    "the experimental far - field pattern is asymmetric , showing some deviations from the ray - dynamical calculation .",
    "an intrinsic mechanism leading to the asymmetry is the locking of modes belonging to different parities @xcite .",
    "the locking is caused by nonlinear modal interaction due to the lasing medium , creating a lasing mode whose emission pattern violates the symmetries of the cavity . when the number of such a lasing mode is large , the asymmetry is averaged out , resulting in a symmetric emission .",
    "however , the asymmetry becomes prominent when the number of such a mode is relatively small @xcite .",
    "for the pumping 500 ma , we can identify many modes with significant intensities in the lasing spectrum shown in fig .",
    "7 , while for the pumping 100 ma we find only a couple of dominant lasing modes in the lasing spectrum shown in fig . 6 ( c ) .",
    "we expect that for 100 ma the relatively small number of the lasing modes makes the emission asymmetry significant .",
    "lastly , we show a ccd photo of the lasing device with the broad contact window at 300 ma in fig . [ fig : nfp ] ( a ) .",
    "although the lasing emission is in - plane , some light scattered inside the cavity is observed from the top in the margin area . for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfp ] ( b ) the field intensity distribution of the rectangle - orbit mode shaded by the electrode metal area .",
    "we can see that bright regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfp ] ( a ) are coming mainly from the four corners of the rectangular orbit .",
    "moreover , we can observe two bright spots around the right hand edge of the cavity .",
    "these are considered to be the light scattered at the cavity boundary , thus indicating the emission points .",
    "these emission points are in good accordance with the theoretical prediction drawn from the husimi distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : husimi ] ( a ) as well as the near - field pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfunc ] ( b ) .",
    "we have focused on the quasi - one - dimensional modes of the asymmetric resonant cavity , which are strongly localized along the stable rectangular ray orbit that is confined by tir .",
    "direct numerical calculation of such a resonant mode revealed that directional emission occurs from cavity boundary points apart from the rectangular ray orbit .",
    "this at first sight counterintuitive result was explained by the chaos - assisted emission mechanism consisting of regular - to - chaotic tunneling and subsequent chaotic transport leading to refractive emission .",
    "we fabricated the cavity with the structure to selectively excite the rectangle - orbit modes .",
    "the success of the selective excitation was confirmed by the observation of the equidistantly spaced peaks in the lasing spectra well corresponding the longitudinal mode spacing of the rectangle - orbit modes . in the emission patterns , we observed directional emission attributed to the chaos - assisted emission .",
    "our results demonstrated that the concepts of quantum / wave chaos and nonlinear dynamics such as dynamical tunneling and unstable manifolds are indispensable for precisely understanding phenomena occurring in the micro devices . as a way to extract light from optical cavities",

    "<S> we study emission from quasi - one - dimensional modes of an asymmetric resonant cavity that are associated with a stable periodic ray orbit confined inside the cavity by total internal reflection . </S>",
    "<S> it is numerically demonstrated that such modes exhibit directional emission , which is explained by _ chaos - assisted emission _ induced by dynamical tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> fabricating semiconductor microlasers with the asymmetric resonant cavity , we experimentally demonstrate the selective excitation of the quasi - one - dimensional modes by employing the device structure to preferentially inject currents to these modes and observe directional emission in good accordance with the theoretical prediction based on chaos - assisted emission . </S>"
