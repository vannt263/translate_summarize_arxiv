    "<S> the dependence of the dressed quark propagator on the quark chemical potential is investigated in various models based on the dyson - schwinger equations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the critical chemical potential of the chiral symmetry restoration transitions is strongly dependent on the nature of the interaction kernel in the infrared region .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of the thermodynamic phase structure of qcd has many implications for astrophysics and relativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> an understanding of the behaviour of strongly interacting matter in regions of non - zero temperature and density will give insight into the nature of primordial baryogenesis and the dynamics of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> heavy ion colliders such as rhic and lhc will soon provide experimental data in thermodynamic regions where chiral symmetry is predicted to be restored .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of qcd at non - zero temperature and zero density has been explored extensively using numerical simulations of lattice qcd . </S>",
    "<S> these results and other model based calculations suggest that there is a critical temperature , @xmath0190  mev @xcite , above which normal nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma in which chiral symmetry is restored . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , current lattice simulation methods have significant difficulties when a non - zero quark or baryon density is introduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , studies in models that implement the pertinent features of qcd are important . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present results from such a study utilising the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) framework @xcite .    at present </S>",
    "<S> we make no attempt to incorporate the colour superconducting ground state that has been shown to occur at asymptotic quark densities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of these results to qcd at densities of interest in nuclear physics ( where perturbative results are suspect ) is not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> these densities have only been investigated in simple approximations such as the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite and the munczek - nemirovsky ( dse ) model @xcite which may not be reliable representations of qcd in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of the current work may address these deficiencies and is under investigation .    in principle , the dse s determine all possible information about a quantum field theory by providing all of its schwinger functions . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , they form a countably infinite set of coupled integral equations with the equation for an @xmath1point schwinger function depending on @xmath2 and higher point functions . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is derived from these equations by specifying a scheme for truncating this infinite system through modelling the requisite , undetermined schwinger functions .    </S>",
    "<S> previously , simple dse models @xcite have been used to investigate the restoration of chiral symmetry as the quark density ( or chemical potential ) increases . </S>",
    "<S> a phase transition has been found at a critical chemical potential , @xmath3  300400 mev . </S>",
    "<S> here we examine the effect on this result of using different quark self - energy kernels .    in euclidean space </S>",
    "<S> ( with metric @xmath4 , and clifford algebra @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , we separate the inverse quark propagator , @xmath7 , at non - zero quark chemical potential , @xmath8 , into its spacelike and timelike vector parts , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and scalar part , @xmath11 : @xmath12 where the quark momentum @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator is renormalised at the ( o(4 ) invariant ) scale @xmath14 which is large enough that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the free propagator for a quark with running current mass @xmath17 . in terms of the regularised self - energy @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , the inverse propagator can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the bare , regularisation dependent mass occuring in the lagrangian , @xmath21 a regularisation parameter ( we use @xmath22 with a simple cutoff regulator @xmath21 ) , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively , the spacelike and timelike field renormalisations , dependent on both the regularisation and renormalisation scales . as we renormalise at @xmath25 </S>",

    "<S> the dse satisfied by the self - energy is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the full , nonperturbative gluon propagator and the quark gluon vertex respectively and \\{a , b } are colour indices with @xmath30 for the standard gell - mann su(3 ) representation @xmath31 @xcite .    as is the case for the propagator </S>",
    "<S> , the self - energy can be expressed in terms of three scalar functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35 these functions satisfy the coupled dses , @xmath36\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 ; @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the trace is over dirac and colour space . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the vertex renormalisation @xmath41 to be the same as the field renormalisation , @xmath42 , which is consistent with the use of the bare vertex @xmath43 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the renormalisation condition ( [ freeprop ] ) implies that @xmath44 thus the regulator independent propagator functions are defined by @xmath45 equations ( [ invprop ] ) through ( [ propfunc ] ) form a coupled set of nonlinear integral equations for the quark propagator , and once the self - energy kernel @xmath46 is specified we can proceed to solve them .    here , we consider various models for this kernel , and in particular , separately for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> there are some constraints on the models that we can use to guide our choice ; </S>",
    "<S> the main requirement is that they must be capable of producing dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath49sb ) and confinement @xcite as this is what is found experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of these objects in the ultraviolet region is also dictated by the results of perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the full euclidean space gluon propagator can be written in landau gauge as @xmath50 where we have assumed that the effect of quark chemical potential on the gluon propagator through quark loops is small in comparison to that on the quark propagator . to provide a model for it , </S>",
    "<S> we specify @xmath51 . as the first example </S>",
    "<S> , we choose : @xmath52 which corresponds to the munczek - nemirovsky @xcite ( mn ) model . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been studied in the context of finite temperature and density @xcite and has the advantage that the integral equations of the dse reduce to algebraic equations ( albeit nonlinear ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining models are variations on the form : @xmath53 } { q^2({\\mbox{\\footnotesize $ \\frac{1}{2}$}})\\ln\\left[\\tau+\\left(1+\\frac{q^2}{\\lambda_{qcd}^2}\\right)^2\\right]}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the one loop anomalous dimension @xmath54 , the qcd scale parameter is set at @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the last term in eq.([mrprop ] ) implements the results of perturbative qcd to one loop . </S>",
    "<S> however , the quantities we study in this paper are determined primarily by the low momentum structure of the kernel and are relatively insensitive to this ultra - violet behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms of the model provide some infrared enhancement to the self - energy , leading to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath49sb ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exact form of the ir enhancement of the quark self - energy kernel is unknown @xcite that is modelled and the particular separation into gluon propagator and vertex function is arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> ] , and by varying @xmath57 and to some extent @xmath58 it is possible to explore various possibilities . for @xmath59 , </S>",
    "<S> the propagator ( [ mrprop ] ) essentially reduces to that considered in refs.@xcite , however we have also included the uv tail which provides the correct leading - log asymptotic behaviour for the quark propagator . for @xmath60 this is the propagator considered at zero density in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , with @xmath61 we get the propagator used in ref.@xcite .    in order to motivate the different models used here for the vertex , </S>",
    "<S> we first briefly outline the method used to obtain the critical chemical potential . for a given self - energy kernel , </S>",
    "<S> the dse s for the quark propagator are solved self - consistently to find solutions representing the nambu - goldstone phase ( characterised by d@xmath49sb ) and a wigner - weyl phase ( corresponding to the quark - gluon plasma where chiral symmetry is restored ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energetic stability of these two solutions is then compared using an effective action for the composite operators @xmath7 and @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> one commonly used truncation of the dse ( [ selfdse ] ) , called the rainbow approximation , involves replacing the full vertex in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ selfdse ] ) by the bare vertex , @xmath63 in this case , the correct action to use is the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) effective action @xcite which is given by @xmath64 = { \\rm trln}\\left[s_0^{-1}s\\right ] + { \\mbox{\\footnotesize $ \\frac{1}{2}$}}{\\rm tr}\\left[\\sigma s\\right].\\ ] ]    we wish to explore the effects of moving beyond the rainbow approximation ( ideally to a vertex that respects the various symmetries of the full vertex , see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , but must first address the question of which effective action should be used to measure the energy of the different solutions . for a more complicated vertex , functionally dependent on the quark propagator , the cjt action is not the correct object to use @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the correction required is so far only calculable in a limited number of cases . </S>",
    "<S> this restricts the types of models that we can use for the vertex .    </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we use the next level of truncation of the dse ( [ selfdse ] ) ; a one loop vertex involving the non - perturbative quark and gluon propagators . </S>",
    "<S> this vertex was introduced in ref.@xcite and used further in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in combination with the appropriate bethe - salpeter kernel </S>",

    "<S> we stress that while this prescription is a reasonable generalisation of the model to finite @xmath8 , it is essentially arbitrary and different results are obtained with other prescriptions @xcite .    for this model , the critical chemical potential ( @xmath75 such that @xmath76-{\\cal    a}_{\\rm cjt}[s_{\\rm symm.}]=0 $ ] ) is displayed as a function of the coupling strength @xmath77 in fig . </S>",

    "<S> similarly , as the infrared strength of the propagator is broadened by increasing @xmath58 for a given @xmath90 and @xmath57 , @xmath75 again decreases . </S>",
    "<S> table 1 summarises the parameters used and the corresponding values of the critical chemical potential for the various models considered here .    the effect on @xmath75 of using the one loop vertex is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , the solutions themselves are modified , resulting in a change to both the physical values for the model parameters and the action differences . using the corrected action , @xmath94 , and the mn gluon propagator , </S>",
    "<S> the critical chemical potential is @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the correction to the action produces an additional shift . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this for the mn model though similar , ( but less clean ) conclusions can be drawn from the maris - roberts type models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 ( dashed line ) shows the curve of critical chemical potential for the one loop vertex mn model evaluated with the full action , @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> also illustrated in the bottom panel of this figure is the effect of the correction term , @xmath97 , on the critical chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> data are shown for the difference between the critical chemical potentials obtained from the one loop vertex solutions using the cjt and full , one loop actions ; specifically for @xmath98/\\mu^{\\rm 1l}_{\\rm crit}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the effect of the correction term is insignificant ( @xmath99% for the range of values for @xmath78 considered here ) in comparison to the modification of @xmath75 because of the use of one loop solutions .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , the studies performed here make it clear that the critical chemical potential is an `` observable '' that is sensitive to the non - perturbative structure of the quark self energy kernel . for reasonable models with parameters fitted to the quark condensate , pion mass and decay constant , we find that @xmath75 lies between 300 and 650  mev . our studies utilising a one loop vertex support the possibility that the cjt action , although not strictly appropriate , provides a reliable extraction of @xmath75 for vertices other than the bare vertex . </S>",
    "<S> whether this remains true for ( physically ) more acceptable vertices such as those of ball and chiu or curtis and pennington@xcite remains an open question . </S>"
