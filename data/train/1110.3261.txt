    "the similarity between the friedel oscillations of the fa and the friedel impurity supports the concept of a `` kondo '' resonance at the fermi level .",
    "the position of the @xmath1-point suggests that the half - width of the fa resonance is of the order of the kondo energy @xmath160 .",
    "our calculations of the friedel oscillations support the concept that there is a kondo resonance at the fermi level with the phase shift @xmath161 and suggests that even for relatively small values of @xmath102 the quasi - particle behavior is similar to that of a friedel impurity .",
    "it should be emphasized that the spatial behavior of the fair wave function and its charge and spin oscillations provides quantitative information about kondo energy , kondo length and resonance width of a fa impurity without the need of a magnetic field or excited states ."
