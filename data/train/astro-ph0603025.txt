    "the evolution of the most massive stars is not well understood .",
    "after the main sequence , stars with masses @xmath2@xmath3 should go through the red supergiant phase , or directly to a short - lived luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase , to become wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. , langer et al .",
    "1994 ; stothers & chin 1996 ) before termination as supernovae ( sne ; e.g. , woosley , langer , & weaver 1993 ) or `` collapsars '' ( e.g. , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "lbvs which experience normal eruptions or outbursts generally increase in brightness by one or two visual magnitudes , but remain relatively constant in bolometric luminosity ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "however , the extremely rare case of @xmath1 carinae ( e.g. , davidson & humphreys 1997 ) shows that some very massive stars go through tremendous eruptive phases of mass ejection prior to the end of their lives .",
    "an estimate of the initial mass for @xmath1 car is @xmath4150 @xmath5 ( hillier et al .",
    "the very massive stars define the upper luminosity boundary of the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram",
    ". it would , of course , be very instructive to determine the prevalence of ( and mass range for ) the stars which undergo outbursts prior to becoming a sn .",
    "several recent luminous events which have been identified as sne are probably not genuine sne at all .",
    "instead , it is argued that these are more likely to be super - outbursts of very massive stars , analogous to @xmath1 car ( goodrich et al .",
    "1989 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; van dyk et al .",
    "the energetics are comparable to those of sne ; hence , these objects act as sn `` impostors . ''",
    "the `` classical '' examples are sn 1954j / v12 in ngc 2403 ( humphreys , davidson , & smith 1999 ; smith , humphreys , & gehrz 2001 ; van dyk et al .",
    "2005 ) and sn 1961v in ngc 1058 ( e.g. , van dyk , filippenko , & li 2002 , van dyk 2005 ; however , see chu et al .",
    "two more well - studied cases are sn 1997bs in m66 ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) and sn 2000ch in ngc 3432 ( wagner et al .",
    "these objects were all underluminous and exhibited photometric behavior unlike that of any normal sne . for sn 1997bs , van dyk et al .",

    "( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 f606w image .",
    "unfortunately , no color information was available for the star to compare it to theoretical evolutionary models , in order to derive or strictly constrain the star s mass .",
    "in this paper we present another similar case , sn 2002 kg , also in ngc 2403 , which we similarly argue is not actually an explosion at the end of a massive star s life , but instead is the powerful eruption of a lbv .",
    "sn 2002 kg was discovered on 2003 october 22 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by schwartz & li ( 2003 ) with the tenegra ii and katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; li et al .",

    "filippenko & chornock ( 2003 ) identified the sn spectroscopically as a type ii-``narrow '' supernova ( sn  iin ; schlegel 1990 , filippenko 1991 , 1997 ) ; it has balmer emission lines exhibiting a narrow component atop a broader base , but with characteristics more similar to those of sn 1997bs ( van dyk et al .  2000 ) than to the prototypical sne  iin ( e.g. , sn 1988z , turatto et al .  1993",

    "we first identified sn 2002 kg with a previously known luminous irregular blue variable ( v37 ) in the host galaxy and provided an estimate of the initial mass of this precursor star . here",
    "we present a more detailed discussion .",
    "weis & bomans ( 2005 ) also have recently identified sn 2002 kg with v37 and discuss its historical light curve .",
    "since the host galaxy has been monitored frequently by kait we are able to obtain unfiltered ( @xmath7 ) photometry for the sn 2002 kg outburst over a period of more than one year .",
    "li et al .  ( 2003 ) discuss how the unfiltered magnitudes for an object can be transformed to standard @xmath8 magnitudes , with knowledge of its detailed color evolution .",
    "if the object s color remains unchanged , then the transformation is merely a constant offset .",
    "we find that the sn has approximately the same color ( within @xmath90.1 mag ) at both an early and late time in the outburst ( see  5 ) ; we could therefore follow the prescription in li et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to derive the offset .",
    "equivalently , we can simply adjust the kait magnitudes , by about @xmath10 mag , based on the offset between the unfiltered magnitude from the march 25.17 ( jd 2452723.67 ) kait observation and the @xmath8-band magnitude from the march 26.15 ( jd 2452724.65 ) palomar observation ( see  2.1.2 ; we consider the likely change in the @xmath8 magnitude over about one day to be insignificant for our purposes ) .",
    "we note that systematic errors in the magnitudes probably still exist for this kait light curve , due to the broad spectral range of the unfiltered images and the assumption of constant color for sn 2002 kg ( which may not apply for the entire outburst ) .",
    "we list the resulting @xmath8 magnitudes in table 1 and show the light curve in figure 2 , after further correcting for both extinction ( see  3 ) and the true distance modulus to ngc 2403 ( @xmath11 mag ; freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the light curve shows highly erratic and unusual behavior for a sn .",
    "the maximum @xmath8 luminosity is about @xmath12 mag , more than 7 mag fainter than a typical sn iin ( see van dyk et al .",
    "2000 , their figure 5 ) .",
    "in fact , this light curve is more qualitatively similar to those of the possible @xmath1 car analog , sn 2000ch ( wagner et al .",
    "2004 , their figure 3 ) , or the lbv s doradus ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ; their figure 2 ) .",
    "schwartz & li ( 2003 ) note that sn 2002 kg is not detectable , @xmath13 mag ( @xmath14 mag ) , in a kait image from 1998 november 13 .",
    "apparently we first caught the sn with kait while it was already undergoing the observed outburst ( this is supported by the lack of detection at earlier epochs , based on data from other telescopes ; see  2.1.2 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of this outburst was already @xmath42 mag brighter at that time than when the precursor star was in quiescence ( see also  3 ) .",
    "as schwartz & li ( 2003 ) point out , the light curve shows a brightening trend between 2002 october 26 , when the outburst was first noticed , and 2003 early january .",
    "the light curve then shows a noticeable dip after 2003 january 1 , before reaching maximum near 2003 mid - march .",
    "the brightness declines yet again by late march .",
    "no coverage exists from kait between 2003 late march and mid - october , so we have no knowledge of the outburst behavior during that interval .",
    "however , by october 11 sn 2002 kg has approximately the same brightness as it did in late march . during 2003 october and november the object remains at a relatively constant brightness .",
    "we then see a pronounced dip in the light curve , after 2003 late november through 2004 early march .",
    "the light curve rises again into 2004 early april , at which time our kait coverage terminates .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of sn 2000ch ; wagner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) speculate that the dip seen for sn 2000ch may be due to either a dust formation event , an eclipse , or changes within an optically thick ejected envelope . for sn",
    "2002 kg , this dip is much broader in time than was seen for sn 2000ch .",
    "we suspect that for sn 2002 kg the light curve dip is more likely due to opacity changes in the ejected envelope than to dust formation ( see  4 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , we obtained @xmath8 , as well as @xmath15 , images of sn 2002 kg with the palomar 1.5-m telescope on 2003 march 26.15 . in figure 3",
    "we show the @xmath16-band image .",
    "we extracted instrumental magnitudes for the relatively bright sn 2002 kg in the palomar images via fitting an empirically derived model point - spread function ( psf ) for each band , using daophot ( stetson 1987 ) within iraf .",
    "unfortunately , no photometric calibration was obtained during these palomar observations .",
    "however , larsen & richtler ( 1999 ) also obtained @xmath17 ( plus h@xmath18 ) images of ngc 2403 with the nordic optical telescope ( not ) on 1997 october 13 , prior to sn 2002 kg , under very good seeing conditions of @xmath19 .",
    "( we will discuss these not images in more detail in  3 . )",
    "we extracted instrumental magnitudes from the not broad - band images using iraf , first with a 4  aperture and then with a psf for each band .",
    "calibration was established using photometry of a number of isolated stars through a 20  aperture , which matches the aperture used to establish the calibration through standard - star observations by larsen ( 1999 ; we also applied the appropriate extinction corrections , supplied via a private communication from s.  s.  larsen ) .",
    "we have compared our photometry with the @xmath20 bright - star photometry of sandage ( 1984 ) and @xmath21 photometry of zickgraf & humphreys ( 1991 ) and find good agreement across all bands .",
    "we tie the photometry from the palomar images to that from the calibrated not images and list the results in table 2 .",
    "as mentioned above in  2.1.1 , we used the @xmath8 magnitude for sn 2002 kg from these palomar data to adjust the unfiltered kait light curve .",
    "we also include this @xmath8 magnitude from palomar in the light curve shown in figure 2 .",
    "a number of images of ngc 2403 obtained in several bands prior to 2002 october are also available in the isaac newton group archive .",
    "these images have a range of sensitivities , and sn 2002 kg is not detected in any of them .",
    "we list the resulting upper limits to detection of the outburst in table 2 .",
    "additionally , sn 2002 kg was observed on 2004 august 17 with the wide field channel ( wfc ) and on 2004 september 21 with the high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , on - board _",
    "the august observations were obtained during a campaign by program go-10182 ( pi : filippenko ) to observe sn 2004dj , the third historical sn in ngc 2403 . the imaging strategy for sn 2004dj",
    "was purposely designed so that the site of sn 2002 kg would also be contained in the wfc images .",
    "the september observations were obtained as part of a larger snapshot program observing sne ( go-10272 ; pi : filippenko ) .",
    "the wfc exposures were 600 s in f475w , 650 s in f658n , and 350 s each in f606w and f814w .",
    "the hrc exposures were 840 s in f435w and 360 s in f625w .",
    "the images were all extracted from the _ hst _ archive . for the wfc data we recombined the individual `` flt '' exposures in all four bands at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) , in order to more reliably remove cosmic - ray hit features from the images , and , in effect , produce our own drizzled ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) `` drz '' images independent of the _ hst _ data pipeline .    the wfc f606w image is shown in figure 4 .",
    "we performed psf - fitting photometry within iraf / daophot on the broad - band wfc images .",
    "the empirical psf for each band was derived from the @xmath22 brightest , uncrowded , and unsaturated stars in these images , based on a @xmath23 aperture . for the wfc narrow - band image , we performed aperture photometry only , using a @xmath23 aperture .",
    "we determined that any correction to the magnitudes for the degradation of charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) is @xmath240.2% in all bands ( see riess & mack 2004 ) .",
    "next , for the f475w and f606w filters we applied the corrections from a @xmath23 aperture to infinite aperture from table 5 in sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; for the f814w filter , we applied the correction from their table 6 , assuming the effective wavelength from their table 8 for approximate spectral type f2 .",
    "we then applied the zero points ( vegamag for the broad bands , and stmag for the narrow band ) in table 10 of sirianni et al .  to the corrected instrumental magnitudes",
    "the resulting flight system magnitudes are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .    in the hrc images sn 2002 kg is relatively isolated , so we simply employed aperture photometry ( assuming a @xmath23 radius aperture ) within iraf .",
    "we then applied the corrections to infinite aperture from table 5 and the zero points from table 11 in sirianni et al .",
    "the resulting flight system magnitudes are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    finally , we transformed the broad - band magnitudes into the johnson - cousins system , also following sirianni et al . , keeping in mind the fact that sn 2002 kg shows strong emission lines ( filippenko & chornock 2003 , and also  2.2 ) , whereas the stars used to establish the transformations all show normal absorption - line spectra .",
    "we list the resulting magnitudes in the standard photometric system in table 2 .",
    "we also include the hrc @xmath8-band data in the light curve shown in figure 2 .",
    "optical spectra of sn 2002 kg were obtained at the keck 10-m telescope with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on 2003 january 6 ( the confirmation spectrum ; jd 2452646.0 ) during the early brightening trend , on 2003 november 29 ( jd 2452973.0 ) , prior to the pronounced dip in brightness , and on 2004 december 12 ( jd 2453352.03 ) at relatively later times .",
    "these observations had spectral resolution of @xmath96   across most of the spectral range , 30009430   ( the resolution is somewhat worse in the near - infrared ) .",
    "the 2004 december spectrum was obtained with a 600-line grism on the blue side , whereas the other two lris spectra were obtained with a 400-line grism in the blue . at h@xmath18 the resolution ( fwhm ) of these",
    "spectra is @xmath9320 km s@xmath31 .",
    "in addition , a spectrum was obtained on 2003 november 20 ( 2452964.0 ) , while the object was still bright , with the blue channel of the spectrograph on the 6.5-m multiple - mirror telescope ( mmt ) . a 300-line grating",
    "was used , with spectral range 37008300  . for the keck spectra conventional data reductions",
    "were performed within iraf , including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and wavelength calibration , while our own idl routines were used for flux calibration and removal of telluric lines ( e.g. , matheson et al .",
    "reduction of the mmt spectrum was performed in a similar fashion .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the overall shape of the continuum has remained relatively blue throughout 2003 and 2004 , peaking near 3700  .",
    "the spectra all show several strong emission lines , primarily of h , but also of possible weak fe ii at 45004600   and at 51505350  , as well as possible blends of h with he i. figure 6 shows just the h@xmath18 plus [ n  ii ] @xmath326548 , 6584  lines .",
    "the narrow balmer profiles are unresolved , and the broad profiles at h@xmath18 remain relatively constant throughout 2003 and 2004 , with gaussian velocity widths @xmath33 km s@xmath31 .",
    "such a velocity width for the line is uncharacteristically low for a young sn , but consistent with the terminal wind velocities for lbvs .",
    "the presence of the prominent , unresolved [ n  ii ] emission lines , while other forbidden lines ( e.g. , due to o and s ) appear weak or absent , suggests a possible n enhancement in the circumstellar gas .    from the line profiles in figure 6",
    "it is clear that the power in the h@xmath18+[n  ii ] emission has steadily declined .",
    "this trend is consistent with that of the @xmath8-band light curve for the observation dates of the spectra .",

    "( the absolute flux scale for the keck spectra is accurate to @xmath38% or better . )    in the blue portion of the spectra , shown in figure 7 , we see most notably the presence of various absorption lines , mostly due to higher - order balmer lines , and possible blends with he  i. strong ca  ii h and k lines ( the h component is also probably blended with h@xmath39 ) are also seen , particularly in 2003 , but we suspect these lines are dominated by interstellar absorption local to the sn ( the extinction toward the sn appears to be significant ; see  3 ) .",
    "such absorption features are not typically seen in sn spectra .",
    "( we have been very careful in the extraction of the spectra from the 2-dimensional images and can safely rule out contamination by a neighboring star . )",
    "the equivalent widths of these lines indicate an underlying star with spectral type and luminosity class of a late o or early - to - mid b supergiant .",
    "we compare the sn 2002 kg spectra to those of the lbv s dor ( from 1996 , during outburst ; massey 2000 ) and the well - studied s dor - type lbv ag carinae ( in a deep minimum state ; walborn & fitzpatrick 2000 ) .",
    "although the balmer emission lines for sn 2002 kg lack the p - cygni profiles seen in the ag car spectrum , the sn spectra , overall , show a remarkable resemblance to that for s dor in outburst .",
    "we therefore consider the spectroscopic evidence quite compelling that sn 2002 kg is not a true sn , but instead a s dor - like lbv in outburst .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached by weis & bomans ( 2005 ) .",
    "from the palomar images (  2.1.2 ) we measure an accurate absolute position for the sn of @xmath18(j2000 ) = @xmath40 , @xmath41(j2000 ) = @xmath42 , with a total uncertainty of @xmath43 , using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) as the astrometric reference ( see van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003 ) .",
    "this position differs by @xmath44 from that reported by schwartz & li ( 2003 ) , and results in an offset from the host galaxy s nucleus of @xmath45 east and @xmath46 south .",
    "we then applied the same astrometric grid to the not images ( with a @xmath47 total uncertainty in the grid ) . in figure 8",
    "we show the not @xmath16-band image from 1997 .",
    "when the absolute sn position is superimposed on this image , it coincides _ exactly _ with the star indicated by the arrow in the figure .",
    "this star is almost certainly the precursor of sn 2002 kg .",
    "we find that this star had @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 mag ( see table 2 ) .",
    "( uncertainties include the uncertainties in the standard calibration in each band from larsen 1999 , his table 1 , added in quadrature with the measurement uncertainties from iraf . ) the fainter ( @xmath53 mag ) , redder ( @xmath54 mag ) star @xmath55 to the northeast is well outside the total uncertainty in the sn position in the not image , @xmath56 ( summing in quadrature the total uncertainty in the sn position measured from the lick image and the uncertainty in the astrometric grid on the not image )",
    ". also , this fainter star appears at approximately this same brightness ( to within one magnitude ) and color in the _ hst _ images as in the not images , whereas sn 2002 kg ( and therefore its precursor ) have changed more significantly both in brightness and in color ( compare figure 8 with figure 3 and see table 2 ) .",
    "we note that weis & bomans ( 2004 ) also attempt to identify the precursor , but , using pre - outburst ground - based images with inferior spatial resolution , they are unable to distinguish the star we have identified as the precursor from its fainter neighbor without consulting the post - outburst _ hst _ images .",
    "this precursor star had actually been identified first by tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) in their photographic study of supergiants in ngc 2403 .",
    "we have determined this from a careful astrometric comparison of their figure 5 , an enlargement of a 103ao photographic plate of the galaxy , with the not @xmath16-band image .",
    "the sn precursor star we have identified lines up very well with the position of the catalogued bright blue irregular variable star , no .  37 ( hereafter , v37 ) from tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) .",
    "we consider the positional coincidence a compelling indication that the two stars are one and the same ( see also weis & bomans 2005 ) .",
    "tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) describe the @xmath57 light curve for v37 as exhibiting relatively small amplitudes of @xmath58 mag , between about 19 and 21 mag , and characteristic fluctuation timescales of several years ( see their figure 10 ) . where data were available between about 1948 and 1963 , the observed @xmath59 color of v37 apparently fluctuated between @xmath60 and @xmath61 mag .",
    "the maximum absolute @xmath57 magnitude for v37 during their monitoring was @xmath62 , although generally it was @xmath63 mag .",
    "we can estimate the extinction and reddening to this star by placing it in color - color diagrams ( figure 9 ) , based on the not and _ hst _ acs",
    "/ wfc photometry . also shown in both diagrams",
    "are the loci of the main sequence and supergiants ( drilling & landolt 2000 ) , and the reddening vector for ob supergiants , assuming a cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) reddening law .",
    "figure 9a , in particular , implies that the star is a blue supergiant reddened along this vector , at @xmath64 mag ( @xmath65 = 0.19 \\pm 0.06 $ ] mag ) .",
    "most of this extinction must be in the star s local environment ; the component of the galactic foreground extinction alone is only @xmath66 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) . in figure 9",
    "we also show the loci of stars in the precursor s immediate ( @xmath67 pc ) environment ; the reddening in the environment appears to be quite variable , with many stars more reddened than the precursor .",
    "( the fainter star @xmath68 to the northeast is quite reddened , with @xmath69 mag . )",
    "the extinction toward the precursor is generally consistent with the interstellar extinction for stars in its environment .    correcting the star s observed photometry for the implied extinction and reddening , as well as for the true distance modulus of ngc 2403 ( @xmath70 mag ; freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , we find @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 mag .",

    "this identification of the star s type , based on color alone , is consistent with that inferred from the underlying absorption - line features in the sn spectra .    during outburst ,",
    "as seen in figure 9b from the 2003 march palomar data , the star has developed the observed colors of a late a - type or early f - type supergiant .",
    "v37 , therefore , is following the typical behavior of a normal lbv during outburst : a `` pseudo - photosphere '' expands in an optically thick stellar wind , increasing the star s",

    "if we assume that @xmath82 has remained constant , pre - outburst and at maximum , then , with the intrinsic pre - outburst color of the star , @xmath88 mag , and the corresponding @xmath89 k , we can place the star in a hr diagram and estimate the initial mass of the precursor .",
    "we show the star s location in such a hr diagram in figure 10 . for comparison",
    "we show the theoretical evolutionary tracks from lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) , with enhanced mass loss for the most massive stars , for a 120 , 85 , 60 , and 40 @xmath5 star . in figure 10a",
    "we show the tracks assuming solar metallicity ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "it is also possible , however , that the star may have had abundances different from solar .",
    "sn 2002 kg is @xmath91 from the galaxy nucleus , which translates to a galactocentric distance @xmath92 kpc . from a study of the metallicity gradient in ngc 2403 by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the value of log(o / h)+12 at this distance is 8.6 dex . with the solar log(o / h)+12 abundance at 8.8 dex ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) , the metallicity in this region of the galaxy may actually be somewhat subsolar ; thus , in figure 10b we show the tracks calculated at the next lowest metallicity , @xmath93 , as well .    what can immediately be seen from this figure , regardless of metallicity ,",
    "is that the sn 2002 kg precursor , v37 , is well off the zero - age main sequence and is in a more evolved evolutionary phase .",
    "we conclude that the initial mass for v37 is @xmath94 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not be more restrictive in our initial mass estimate , since , due to the uncertainties in the photometry , distance , and reddening of the star , the termini of the 120 , 85 , and 60 @xmath5 tracks are also consistent with this photometry .",
    "nonetheless , the hr diagrams indicate that v37 is indeed a very massive star in the upper regions of the hr diagram , consistent with the theoretical mass estimates of stars which go through the lbv phase .",
    "from the not and acs / wfc h@xmath18 images , we can investigate the gaseous environment of v37 , both before and during outburst .",
    "weis & bomans ( 2005 ) have pointed out that in both the _ hst _ images obtained in the f658n band and ground - based images from 2001 , net h@xmath18 emission is seen at the position of the star .",
    "however , humphreys & aaronson ( 1987 ) describe a spectrum of the star obtained in 1985 as consisting of absorption lines and a blue continuum ( consistent with features seen in our own spectra of sn 2002kg / v37 ) , but with no emission lines visible .",
    "weis & bomans speculate that the observed h@xmath18 emission is due to the formation of a lbv nebula , associated with the current outburst or possibly ejected during an earlier evolutionary phase ( e.g. , lamers et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we confirm that net h@xmath18 ( + [ n  ii ] ) emission is associated with the star at least as early as 1997 , by subtracting the not @xmath8 continuum image from the h@xmath18 narrow - band image , after first intensity - scaling the two images ( this technique can do a reasonable job of removing the continuum , when a specific narrow - line bandpass filter contiguous to h@xmath18 in wavelength is not available ; see waller 1990 ) .",
    "we show the result of this subtraction in figure 11 ; there is a very compact ( i.e. , unresolved and not extended ) h@xmath18 ( + [ n  ii ] ) source at the exact position of the star .",
    "we would expect a star with spectral type o9b2 to have an associated photoionization ( h  ii ) region . if we scale the not net h@xmath18 ( + [ n  ii ] ) image by fluxes for the giant h  ii regions s158 , s256 , and s298 in ngc 2403 ( sivan et al .",
    "1990 ; drissen et al .",
    "1999 ) , we find a flux @xmath34 } \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-15}$ ] erg @xmath35 s@xmath31 for the nebula ( uncorrected for extinction ) .",
    "we can correct for extinction using the relation @xmath95 from viallefond & goss ( 1986 ) , and with @xmath86 mag ( assuming the line - of - sight extinction to the h  ii region is the same as that toward the precursor ) , we find @xmath96 erg @xmath35 s@xmath31 . at the distance of ngc 2403 ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) this results in a luminosity @xmath97}=2.1 \\times 10^{36}$ ] erg s@xmath31 . using the relation @xmath98 to derive the number of ionizing lyman continuum photons ( @xmath99 ) , and using table ii of panagia ( 1973 ) , we find that this is the approximate equivalent of the ionizing flux from a single b0 i star .",
    "that is , the h@xmath18 emission seen in 1997 is at least consistent with a h  ii region produced by the ionizing flux of a single massive blue supergiant  the outburst precursor , v37 .",
    "subtracting the continuum in the f606w band from the 2004 august acs / wfc f658n image , and scaling the net emission image to the fluxes of the giant h  ii regions s256 and s298 , results in a flux @xmath34 } \\approx 5.2 \\times 10^{-15}$ ] erg @xmath35 s@xmath31 ( uncorrected for extinction ) for sn 2002 kg .",
    "this is approximately a five - fold increase in the h@xmath18 flux during outburst in late 2004 , relative to the pre - outburst state .",
    "we have already seen from  2.2 that in 2003 january , prior to maximum light , the star was already in outburst and was emitting @xmath100 times more h@xmath18 flux than in its quiescent state .",
    "this 2004 august flux from the _ hst _ image is consistent with the declining fluxes derived from the integrated spectral line profiles from 2003 through 2004 ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the outburst h@xmath18 flux is likely originating in the dense , optically thick wind from the star .",
    "but , can we really consider this a lbv nebula ?",
    "the relatively strong [ n  ii ] lines do imply the presence of circumstellar gas , as does the indication of cno - processed material in the wind .",
    "however , a normal lbv eruption does not generally result in the ejection of a massive shell , or nebula , in the first place . if sn 2002 kg is similar to s dor",
    ", then we might expect any nebula to be quite compact .",
    "based on _ hst _ imaging , weis ( 2003 ) places an upper limit on the s dor nebula diameter of 0.25 pc .",
    "similarly , we find that the source is unresolved ( @xmath1011.8 wfc1 pixels fwhm ) in the 2004 august _ hst _ f658n image which , at the distance to ngc 2403 ( 3.13 mpc ; freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , implies a diameter @xmath1011.4 pc for the nebula .",
    "if the wind has been expanding at a constant 370 km s@xmath31 between 2002 oct 26 and 2004 aug 17 , this implies that the wind - blown shell , or nebula , is only @xmath102 pc in diameter .",
    "we infer that the detected h@xmath18 emission is from the ejecta of the recent eruption .",
    "we have shown that sn 2002 kg in ngc 2403 is unlike a typical type ii , core - collapse sn , given both its spectroscopic and photometric properties .",
    "although spectroscopically sn 2002 kg resembles the sne iin , the ejecta expansion velocity , @xmath9370 km s@xmath31 , is much lower than what is observed for the prototypical sne iin ( e.g. , sn 1988z ; turatto et al .",
    "additionally , the star increased only @xmath58 mag in @xmath16 .",
    "we deduce , therefore , that sn 2002 kg is , in fact , not a genuine sn ( strictly defined as the explosion of a star at the end of its life ) , but instead represents an eruption of a normal , or `` classical , '' supergiant lbv star , possibly analogous to s dor . with @xmath103 mag and @xmath104 for the precursor in its quiescent state ,",
    "the star clearly lies on the `` s dor instability strip '' ( wolf 1989 ; humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "we further support this conclusion by showing in figure 12 the absolute light curve for sn 2002 kg , relative to the light curves for other sn impostors ( sne 1961v , 1954j / v12 1997bs and 2000ch ) in a similar vein as van dyk et al .",
    "( 2000 ; their figure 6 ) .",
    "although the bandpasses through which these light curves were generated differ from one object to the other , the relative similarities in luminosity , energy , and variability argue strongly that sn 2002 kg is also a sn impostor .",
    "sn 2002 kg appears from its light curve to be the least energetic example of a sn impostor known so far .",
    "sne 1954j / v12 , 1961v , and @xmath1 car may represent the high - energy end of a pre - sn super - outburst phase , with sn 1997bs and sn 2000ch somewhere in between .",
    "the lower energetics can also be seen in a comparison ( fig .",
    "13 ) of the early - time spectra of sne 2002 kg , 1997bs , and 2000ch .",
    "the overall strength of the balmer - line profiles in sn 2002 kg is lower than in the other two sne .",
    "moreover , the bases of the profiles in sn 2002 kg are not nearly as broad as in sne 1997bs and 2000ch , consistent with the lower ejecta velocities in sn 2002 kg .",
    "( sn 2000ch also shows more of a true p - cygni profile , with shallow blue absorption troughs in the balmer lines . )",
    "sn 2002 kg is clearly less energetic than sn 1954j / v12 in the same host galaxy , ngc 2403 ; this is reflected both in the lower expansion velocity ( @xmath105 km s@xmath31 , versus @xmath106 km s@xmath31 at age @xmath950 yr ; van dyk et al .",
    "2005 ) , and fainter apparent brightness ( @xmath107 \\approx 18.3 $ ] mag versus 16.1 mag ; humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "the precursor of sn 2002 kg is the irregular blue variable star v37 in ngc 2403 , identified by humphreys & aaronson ( 1987 ) and humphreys & davidson ( 1994 ) as a lbv .",
    "we have also directly placed constraints on the initial mass of this precursor to be @xmath108 . as a result of the outburst , the star became redder and attained a nearly constant color ( the @xmath59 color remained relatively unchanged for nearly 1.5 yr ; the overall constant shape of the spectral continua further supports this ) , as the pseudo - photosphere of the optically thick envelope expands . the absolute flux in the h@xmath18 line decreased between early 2003 and late 2004 ; this is also reflected in the @xmath109 color of the star ( 0.41 mag in 2003 march and 0.26 mag in 2004",
    "august / september ) .",
    "the constant color argues against any dust formation event for sn 2002kg / v37 , such as is evident in the homunculus around @xmath1 car and in sn 1954j / v12 ( van dyk et al .",
    "2005 ) , although dust might form later for the sn 2002kg / v37 ejecta .",
    "sn 2002kg / v37 is one of a growing number of objects which``impersonate '' sne iin .",
    "these impostors exhibit a broad range of properties and actually represent a pre - sn evolutionary phase of very massive stars .",
    "it is imperative to continue monitoring the star to detail its further evolution . other recent , less well - studied cases , such as sn 1999bw in ngc 3198 , sn 2001ac in ngc 3504 , and sn 2003gm in ngc 5334 , also require detailed study , to provide valuable additional examples of this rare phenomenon and improve our understanding of massive - star evolution .",
