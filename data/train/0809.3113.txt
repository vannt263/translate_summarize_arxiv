    "the detailed analysis of the available high quality cosmological data ( type ia supernovae @xcite , @xcite ; cmb @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) leads to the conclusion that we live in a flat and accelerating universe . in order to investigate the cosmic history of the observed universe",
    ", we have to introduce a general cosmological model which contains cold dark matter to explain the large scale structure clustering and an extra component with negative pressure , the vacuum energy ( or in a more general setting the `` dark energy '' ) , to explain the observed accelerated cosmic expansion ( refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the nature of the dark energy is one of the most fundamental and difficult problems in physics and cosmology .",
    "there are many theoretical speculations regarding the physics of the above exotic dark energy , such as a cosmological constant ( vacuum ) , quintessence , @xmath1essence , vector fields , phantom , tachyons , chaplygin gas and the list goes on ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such studies are based on the general assumption that the real scalar field @xmath2 rolls down the potential @xmath3 and therefore it could resemble the dark energy @xcite .",
    "this is very important because scalar fields could provide possible solutions to the cosmological coincidence problem . in this framework",
    ", the corresponding stress - energy tensor takes the form of a perfect fluid , with density @xmath4 and pressure @xmath5 . from a cosmological point of view , if the scalar field varies slowly with time , so that @xmath6 , then @xmath7 , which means that the scalar field evolves like a vacuum energy .",
    "of course in order to investigate the overall dynamics we need to define the functional form of the potential energy .",
    "the simplest example found in the literature is a scalar field with @xmath8 ( see for review @xcite , @xcite ) and it has been shown that the time evolution of this scalar field is dominated by oscillations around @xmath9 . of course , the issue of the potential energy has a long history in scalar field cosmology ( see @xcite and references therein ) and indeed several parameterizations have been proposed ( exponential , power law , hyperbolic etc ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the observational consequences of the overall dynamics of a family of flat cosmological models by using a hyperbolic scalar field potential which appears to act both as dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "to do so , we use the traditional hamiltonian approach .",
    "in fact , the idea to build cosmological models in which the dark energy component is somehow linked with the dark matter is not new in this kind of studies .",
    "recently , alternative approaches to the unification of dark energy and dark matter have been proposed in the framework of the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite and in the context of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the basic theoretical elements of the problem are presented in section 2 by solving analytically [ for spatially flat unified dark matter ( udm ) scalar field models ] the equations of motion . in section 3",
    ", we present the functional forms of the basic cosmological functions [ @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in section 4 we place constraints on the main parameters of our model by performing a joint likelihood analysis utilizing the snia data @xcite and the observed baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that the matter density at the present time is @xmath13 while the corresponding scalar field is @xmath14 in geometrical units ( 0.084 in planck units ) .",
    "section 5 outlines the evolution of matter perturbations in the udm model .",
    "also we compare the theoretical predictions provided by the udm scenario with those found by three different type of dark energy models namely @xmath0 cosmology , parametric dark energy model and variable chaplygin gas .",
    "we verify that at late times ( after the inflection point ) the dynamics of the udm scalar model is in a good agreement , with those predicted by the above dark energy models although there are some differences especially at early epochs : ( i ) the udm equation of state parameter takes positive values at large redshifts , ( ii ) it behaves well with respect to the cosmic coincidence problem , and ( iii ) before the inflection point the cosmic expansion in the udm model is much more decelerated than in the other three dark energy models implies that the large scale structures ( such as galaxy clusters ) are more bound systems with respect to those cosmic structures which produced by the other three dark energy models .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "within the framework of homogeneous and isotropic scalar field cosmologies it can be proved ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the main cosmological equations ( the so called friedmann - lemaitre equations ) can be obtained by a lagrangian formulation : @xmath15 + 3ka         \\label{langaf}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath11 is the scalar field , @xmath3 is the potential energy and @xmath16 is the spatial curvature . indeed",
    "the equations of motion take the following forms which corresponds to @xmath17 . for planck units we have to set @xmath18 with @xmath19 . for s.i units we have @xmath20 . ] :    @xmath21&= &       \\frac{\\dot{\\phi}^2}{2}+v(\\phi ) \\label{efe1 } \\\\       2 \\left(\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}\\right)+\\left(\\frac { \\dot{a } } { a }",

    "we would like to stress here that in this work we consider a spatially homogeneous scalar field @xmath2 , ignoring the possible coupling to other fields and quantum - mechanical effects . on the other hand , introducing in the global dynamics a new degree of freedom , in a form of the scalar field @xmath2 , it is possible to make the vacuum energy a function of time ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note of course that the geometry of the space - time is described by the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) line element .    in order to study the above system of differential equations we need to define explicitly the functional form of the scalar field potential energy , @xmath3 , which is not an easy task to do . indeed , in the literature , due to the unknown nature of the dark energy",
    ", there are many forms of potentials proposed by several authors ( for a review see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which describe differently the physics of the scalar field .",
    "it is worth pointing out that for some special cases analytical solutions have been found ( refs . @xcite and references therein ) . as an example , if the potential @xmath3 is modeled as a power law @xmath23 , then the energy density of the scalar field evolves like @xmath24 which means that , for @xmath25 or @xmath26 the corresponding energy density behaves either like non relativistic or relativistic matter . in this work ,",
    "we have used a functional form of @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) for which we solve the previous dynamical problem analytically .",

    "this property simply says that the energy density in @xmath2 tracks @xcite the radiation ( matter ) component .",

    ", there is a possibility for the equation of state parameter to be a function of time rather than a constant ratio between the pressure and the energy density .",

    "these are : ( a ) at early enough times the equation of state parameter tends to its maximum value , @xmath188 , which means that the dark energy density initially takes large values .",
    "so as long as the scalar field rolls down the potential energy , @xmath3 , decreases rapidly and the kinetic energy @xmath209 takes a large value , ( b ) then @xmath2 continues to roll down , the dark energy density decreases and the equation of state parameter remains close to unity for a quite long period of time ( @xmath210 ) and ( c ) for @xmath211 the equation of state parameter is a decreasing function of time and it becomes negative at @xmath212 . before that epoch , the potential energy of the scalar field remains less than the kinetic energy ( see the insert plot in the left panel of figure 4 ) and the equation of state parameter ( or the scalar field ) resembles background matter . in a special case where @xmath213 [ or @xmath214 the equation of state behaves exactly like that of pressure - less matter . for @xmath215",

    "we confirm that in the range @xmath186 and @xmath225 the general behavior ( described before ) of the functional form of the equation of state parameter is an intermediate case between the above lines for @xmath226 and thus it depends weakly on the values of the parameter space ( @xmath227 ) .",

    "the so called spherical collapse model , which has a long history in cosmology , is a simple but still a fundamental tool for understanding how a small spherical patch [ with radius @xmath244 of homogeneous overdensity forms a bound system via gravitation instability @xcite .",
    "from now on , we will call @xmath245 the scale factor of the universe where the overdensity reaches its maximum expansion ( @xmath246 ) and @xmath247 the scale factor in which the sphere virializes , while @xmath248 and @xmath249 the corresponding radii of the spherical overdensity . note that in the spherical region",
    ", @xmath250 is the matter density while @xmath251 will denote the corresponding density of the dark energy . in order to address the issue of the dark energy in the gravitationally bound systems ( clusters of galaxies ) we can consider the following assumptions : ( i ) clustered dark energy considering that that the whole system virializes ( matter and dark energy ) , ( ii ) the dark energy remains clustered but now only the matter virializes and ( iii ) the dark energy remains homogeneous and only the matter virializes ( for more details see @xcite , @xcite @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "note , that in this work we are using the third possibility .    here",
    "we review only some basic concepts of the problem based on the assumption that the dark energy component under a scale of galaxy clusters can be treated as being homogeneous : @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "in general the evolution of the spherical perturbations as the latter decouple from the background expansion is given by the raychaudhuri equation : @xmath255\\;\\ ;   { \\rm here}\\;\\;4\\pi g\\equiv 1/2.\\ ] ] now within the cluster region the evolution of the dark energy component is written as ( see @xcite ) @xmath256 while if we consider a scalar field the above equation becomes @xmath257 where @xmath258 figure 6 presents examples of @xmath259 obtained for the udm ( solid line ) and for the concordance @xmath0 model ( dashed line ) .",
    "the time needed for a spherical shell to re - collapse is twice the turn - around time , @xmath260 .    on the other hand , utilizing both the virial theorem and the energy conservation we reach to the following condition : @xmath261^{a = a_{\\rm f}}= \\left[u_{g}+u_{\\phi_{c } } \\right]^{a = a_{\\rm t } }   \\label{virial}\\ ] ] where @xmath262 is the potential energy and @xmath263 is the potential energy associated with the dark energy for the spherical overdensity ( see @xcite and @xcite ; in our case @xmath264 ) . using the above formulation",
    "we can obtain a cubic equation that relates the ratio between the virial @xmath249 and the turn - around outer radius @xmath248 the so called collapse factor ( @xmath265 ) . notice that eq.([virial ] ) is valid when the ratio of the system s dark energy to the matter s densities at the time of the turn - around takes relatively small values @xcite .",
    "of course in the case of @xmath266 the above expressions get the usual form for @xmath0 cosmology ( @xcite , @xcite ) while for an einstein - de sitter model ( @xmath267 ) we have @xmath268 .        finally solving numerically eq.([virial ] )",
    "[ it can be done also analytically ] we calculate the collapse factor .",
    "in particular , figure 7 shows the behavior of the collapse factor for the current cosmological models starting from the udm ( solid line ) , @xmath0 ( short dashed ) , vcg ( dot dashed ) , and cpl ( long dashed ) .",
    "we find that the collapse factor lies in the range @xmath269 in agreement with previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "prior to the cluster formation epoch ( @xmath234 ) the udm scenario , appears to produce more bound systems with respect to the other dark energy models .",
    "indeed , we find the following values : @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 and @xmath273 . also it becomes clear that the udm collapse factor decreases slowly with the redshift of virialization @xmath274 , due to its positive equation of state parameter .",
    "this is also incorporated by the fact that at early epochs the cosmic expansion of the udm model is much more decelerated than in the other three dark energy models .",
    "the latter result is in agreement with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "they found a similar behavior for the collapse factor by considering several potentials with an exponential phase .",
    "in this work we investigate analytically and numerically the large and small scale dynamics of the scalar field flrw flat cosmologies in the framework of the so called _ unified dark matter _ scenario . in particular using a hamiltonian formulation",
    "we find that the time evolution of the basic cosmological functions are described in terms of hyperbolic functions .",
    "this theoretical approach yields analytical solutions which can accommodate a late time accelerated expansion , equivalent to either the dark energy or the standard @xmath0 models .",
    "furthermore , based on a joint likelihood analysis using the snia data and the baryonic acoustic oscillations , we put tight constraints on the main cosmological parameters of the udm cosmological model . in particular",
    "we find @xmath62 and the scalar field at the present time is @xmath69 or 0.084 ( in planck units ) . also , we compare the udm scenario with various dark energy models namely @xmath0 cosmology , parametric dark energy model and variable chaplygin gas .",
    "we find that the cosmological behavior of the udm scalar field model is in a good agreement , especially after the inflection point , with those predicted by the above dark energy models although there are some differences especially at early epochs . in particular , we reveal that the udm scalar field cosmology has three important differences over the other three dark energy models considered :    * it can pick up positive values of the equation of state parameter at large redshifts ( @xmath275 ) . also , it behaves relatively well with respect to the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "* at early enough epochs ( @xmath197 or @xmath276 ) the cosmic expansion in the udm model is much more decelerated than in the other three dark energy models . in order to investigate whether the expansion of the observed universe has the above property",
    ", we need a visible distance indicator ( better observations ) at high redshifts ( @xmath277 ) . * close to the cluster formation epoch",
    ", its collapse factor @xmath278 is less than @xmath279 of the corresponding factor of the other three dark energy models .",
