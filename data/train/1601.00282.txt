    "the high - frequency radio sky ( @xmath0  ghz ) has been much less widely studied than the population at lower radio frequencies ( e.g.  1.4  ghz ) , mainly due to the increased time required to survey an area to an equivalent depth at higher frequencies . in recent years",
    "several high - frequency surveys have been conducted , albeit with higher flux density limits than surveys at lower frequencies .",
    "@xcite carried out the ninth cambridge ( 9c ) survey at 15  ghz using the ryle telescope .",
    "this survey covers 520  deg@xmath1 to a completeness limit of @xmath2 25  mjy , and was the first high - frequency survey to cover a significant proportion of the sky .",
    "a series of deeper regions were also observed @xcite , with 115  deg@xmath1 complete to @xmath2 10  mjy and 29  deg@xmath1 complete to @xmath2 5.5  mjy .",
    "the whole southern sky has been surveyed by the australia telescope 20 ghz ( at20 g ) survey @xcite , which has a flux density limit of 40 mjy and is 93 per cent complete above 100 mjy .",
    "this survey is complementary to the 9c survey as it covers a larger area at a shallower flux density .",
    "more recently , the at20g - deep pilot survey @xcite surveyed 5  deg@xmath1 to a completeness level of 2.5  mjy .    the tenth cambridge ( 10c )",
    "survey was observed with the cambridge arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; @xcite ) at 15.7  ghz .",
    "the observations , mapping and source extraction are described in @xcite ( hereafter paper f ) and the source counts and spectral properties are presented in @xcite ( hereafter paper d ) .",
    "the 10c survey is complete to 1  mjy in ten different fields covering a total of @xmath3 ; deep areas covering @xmath4 , contained within these fields , are complete to 0.5  mjy , making the 10c survey the deepest high - frequency radio survey published to date .",
    "@xcite used data at a range of frequencies to study the spectral indices of 10c sources in the lockman hole .",
    "they found a significant change in spectral index with flux density ; the median spectral index @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 for a source with flux density @xmath7 at frequency @xmath8 ) calculated between 1.4 and 15.7  ghz changes from 0.75 for sources with @xmath9  mjy to 0.08 for sources with @xmath10  mjy .",
    "this shows that there is a population of flat - spectrum sources emerging below 1  mjy ; @xcite suggest that this may be due to the cores of fanaroff and riley type i ( fri ; @xcite ) sources becoming dominant at 15.7  ghz .",
    "there have been several attempts to model the high - frequency radio sky , often extrapolating from lower frequencies .",
    "early evolutionary models of radio sources @xcite successfully fitted the available data at frequencies @xmath11 10 ghz down to flux densities of a few mjy .",
    "more recently , produced a model of the radio source counts at frequencies @xmath12 5 ghz ( up to 30 ghz ) which successfully fitted the data available at the time .",
    "the model splits the sources into flat and steep - spectrum populations , with the flat - spectrum population further divided into flat - spectrum radio quasars and bl lacs , and determines the epoch - dependent luminosity function for each population .",
    "starforming galaxies , ghz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources and objects in the late stages of agn evolution are also included in the model .    a more recent model by used physically grounded models to extrapolate the 5-ghz source count , which is well known observationally , to higher frequencies .",
    "they focus on the spectral behaviour of blazars and compare three different models which treat flat - spectrum sources differently .",
    "this scheme is successful at high flux densities but does not accurately reproduce the observed 15 ghz source count below @xmath2 10 mjy . the number of sources is significantly underestimated ( by a factor of @xmath13 ) , indicating that the properties of these sources are not well understood , largely due to the complexity and diversity of the high - frequency spectra of individual sources .",
    "@xcite have produced a semi - empirical simulation of the extragalactic radio continuum sky ( the skads simulated sky ; s@xmath14 ) .",
    "the simulation splits the radio sources into separate populations : frii sources , fri sources , radio - quiet agns and starforming galaxies , which are split into quiescent starforming and starbursting galaxies . the observed ( and extrapolated ) radio continuum luminosity functions",
    "are used to generate a catalogue of @xmath2 320 million simulated sources .",
    "this simulation covers 20 @xmath15 20 deg@xmath1 out to a cosmological redshift of @xmath16 and down to a flux density of 10 njy at 151 , 610 mhz , 1.4 , 4.86 and 18 ghz .",
    "@xcite showed that the simulation fails to reproduce the spectral index distribution of 10c sources , dramatically under - predicting the number of flat spectrum sources .",
    "thus , although good progress has been made in recent years in modelling aspects of the extragalactic radio source population , the high - frequency radio source population at low flux densities is poorly described . to understand the nature of the faint , high - frequency population and constrain the models better observations of the faint ,",
    "high - frequency sky are required . in this paper",
    "we present new , deep observations at 15.7  ghz in two 10c fields , which when combined with existing 10c data enable the source counts to be constrained down to 0.1  mjy , a factor of five deeper than the 10c source count .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section  [ section : obs ] describes the observations and data reduction , and section  [ section : source_catalogue ] details the methods used to produce the source catalogue .",
    "section  [ section : checks ] discusses the effects of flux density variability .",
    "the catalogue is used to derive the source counts in section  [ section : source_counts ] and these results are discussed in section  [ section : sc_discussion ] before some brief conclusions are presented in section  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the 15.7-ghz observations were conducted between august 2008 and july 2014 using the arcminute microkelvin imager large array ( ami la ) , located near cambridge , uk .",
    "the ami la consists of eight 13-m antennas with baselines of 18 to 110  m , giving it a primary beam of 5.5  arcmin and a resolution of 30  arcsec .    for the 10c survey",
    "the la observations were made of 10 fields of different sizes , covering a total of 27  deg@xmath1 .",
    "each field consists of an outer region complete to 1  mjy beam@xmath17 , and an inner deeper region complete to 0.5  mjy beam@xmath17 .",
    "here we describe further observations of two of the 10c fields : the ami001 ( j0024 + 3152 ) field and the lockman hole field ( j1052 + 5730 ) , details of which are given in table [ tab : regions ] . from these two fields we selected sub - fields that we observed further , using a rastering technique in the same way as the 10c survey observations , with hexagonal rasters of 37 pointings",
    "each separated by 4 arcmin . in the ami001 field ,",
    "450 hours of new observations have been made in several hexagons ( each consisting of 37 pointings ) , and the rms noise in the centre of the two deepest hexagons is @xmath18 . the noise map for the ami001 field is shown in fig .",

    "details of the data reduction and imaging procedure can be found in paper f.",
    "the source fitting was performed using the cambridge in - house software source_find in the same way as for the 10c survey in order to make the new catalogue as comparable as possible to the 10c catalogue . the procedure implemented in source_find",
    "is described briefly here , full details being given in paper f. the images were used in conjunction with the noise maps shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ami1_noise ] and [ fig : lh_noise ] to identify component ` peaks ' above a given signal - to - noise ratio @xmath25 ( in this case @xmath26 , to take account of the 1.082 phase error correction factor applied to the flux densities ( see section  [ section : flux_values ] for details ) . ] ) .",
    "initially , all pixels greater than @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the local noise ) were identified to ensure all peaks greater than @xmath29 after interpolation are found . the position and flux density of each peak ( ra@xmath30 , dec@xmath30 and @xmath31 )",
    "was then found by interpolation between the pixels , and any peaks less than @xmath29 were discarded .",
    "the error on the peak flux density ( @xmath32 ) is taken to be the thermal noise error @xmath33 combined in quadrature with the five per cent calibration error , @xmath34 .",
    "the integration area , consisting of contiguous pixels down to a lowest contour value of 2.5@xmath28 , was then calculated for each component .",
    "if more than one peak lay inside the same integration area the sources were classified as a ` group ' .",
    "the aips task jmfit was then used to fit a 2d elliptical gaussian to each component .",
    "this was used to estimate the integrated flux density , position and angular size ( ra@xmath35 , dec@xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) for each component .",
    "the error on the integrated flux density ( @xmath38 ) was estimated as the error due to thermal noise ( @xmath33 ) combined in quadrature with the five per cent calibration error , @xmath39 .",
    "the maps display an increase in noise close to bright ( @xmath40  mjy ) sources due to amplitude , phase and deconvolution errors . because this noise is non - gaussian",
    "it is often not included in the noise maps , leading to spurious detections close to bright sources .",
    "for this reason , an ` exclusion zone ' was defined around any source with a peak flux density greater than 15  mjy during the source fitting process , and any source detected within this zone was excluded from the catalogue . as derived empirically in paper d ,",
    "each exclusion zone is a circle centred on the bright source , with a radius defined by : @xmath41 where @xmath31 is the peak flux density of the bright source .",
    "the positions and radii of these exclusion zones are shown in table [ tab : zones ] .",

    "@xcite investigated the effects on deep source counts at 1.4  ghz of sample variance induced by source clustering by extracting a series of independent samples from the s@xmath14 catalogue and comparing to observations .",
    "they used this to present a method for estimating the uncertainty in the source count caused by sample variance for an arbitrary radio survey . in the ami001 field",
    "there is 0.23 deg@xmath1 with rms noise @xmath44jy and 0.42 deg@xmath1 with rms noise @xmath45jy , as shown in the contour plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_kntrs_ami001 ] .",
    "it should therefore be possible to detect a source with @xmath46  mjy in an area of 0.23 deg@xmath1 ; reading off fig .",
    "2 in @xcite for this survey limit and area gives an uncertainty due to cosmic variance of @xmath47  per cent . at higher flux densities",
    ", this uncertainty decreases as the area over which a source could be detected ( the effective survey area ) increases .",
    "for example , for a survey limit of 0.125  mjy ( equivalent to an rms noise of 25@xmath48jy ) and an area of 0.42 deg@xmath1 the uncertainty is 12 per cent .",
    "we therefore expect cosmic variance to affect the faintest flux density bin by @xmath47 per cent .",
    "several effects which could bias the source counts are considered here ; however for the reasons discussed no corrections are made for these biases .",
    "1 .   resolution bias . to calculate the source counts a sample which is complete in terms of integrated flux density is required , but the sources are detected according to their peak flux densities .",
    "this means that a resolved source of a given total flux density is more likely to fall below the peak flux density detection threshold than a point source with the same total flux density . due to the relatively large beam size of ami ,",
    "only 7 per cent of sources in the ami001 field and 4 per cent in the lockman hole field are extended , so resolution is not expected to have a significant effect on these source counts .",
    "2 .   eddington bias @xcite . statistical fluctuations due to thermal noise can alter the flux density of sources and can therefore cause some sources to be put into the wrong bins .",
    "given the shape of the source count , if the true number of sources in one bin is larger than in adjacent bins , more sources will be scattered into that bin than out of it",
    ". the observed number of sources will therefore be biased high .",
    "in paper d it is estimated that this effect will increase the number of sources in the faintest 10c flux density bin by @xmath49 per cent . as incompleteness is expected to reduce the number of sources in this bin by a similar amount they do not correct for this effect .",
    "no correction is applied here for the same reason .",
    "variability in flux densities can cause sources near the edge of flux density bins to move between bins .",
    "the shape of the source counts means that at the bottom of the bin , the number of sources in the positive phase of variability which are included in the bin will be marginally higher than the number of sources in the negative phase of variability which are excluded .",
    "the opposite effect occurs at the other end of the bin but will not be enough to offset this effect .",
    "therefore , variability will boost the number of sources in a bin , causing a constant shift in the observed source count .",
    "the long timescale over which the observations were made means that the effects of short - term variability are generally averaged out , and as discussed in section  [ section : checks ] , we do not find any evidence for significant variability on longer timescales .",
    "figs . [ fig : counts ] and [ fig : de - zotti - counts - combined ] show that the new deeper counts are consistent with the extrapolated 10c fit .",
    "there is no sign of the upturn observed in the 1.4-ghz source counts at @xmath50  mjy ( e.g.  ) ; there is thus no evidence for a new population ( e.g.  of starforming galaxies ) contributing to the 15.7-ghz source population above 0.1  mjy .",
    "this is not surprising , as a source with @xmath51 , typical for a starforming galaxy @xcite , with @xmath52  mjy will have @xmath53  mjy , and would therefore only have appeared at the bottom of the faintest flux density bin here .        a model of the high - frequency ( @xmath54 ) source counts",
    "was produced by , as described in section  [ section : intro ] .",
    "the new 15.7-ghz source counts presented here are compared to the latest version of the model , extracted from their website , in fig .",
    "[ fig : de - zotti - counts - combined ] .",
    "paper d showed that the model under - predicts the number of sources in the 10c survey below @xmath55  mjy ; it is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : de - zotti - counts - combined ] that the model continues to under - predict the number of sources observed by a factor of two as flux density decreases .",
    "@xcite studied the spectral indices of a sample of 10c sources and showed that the proportion of flat - spectrum sources in particular is too low in the model below @xmath56  mjy ; the model predicts that at @xmath57  mjy steep - spectrum sources outnumber flat - spectrum source by a factor of three , while the observations show that there are twice as many flat - spectrum sources as steep - spectrum sources .",
    "it is likely that this under - prediction of the number of flat - spectrum sources in the sub - mjy population is responsible for the discrepancies between the model and the observed count seen here at @xmath58 . above 5  mjy the model over - predicts the number of sources observed , this is discussed further in paper d. the higher - flux density end ( 0.5 mjy to several jy ) of the 15-ghz source counts is studied by combining the 9c and 10c counts with the at20 g survey by @xcite , who investigated the source counts of the steep and flat - spectrum populations separately .",
    "these counts are compared to the and @xcite models , and they find that both underestimate the number of flat - spectrum sources below 5  mjy .",
    "the new 15.7-ghz source count is also compared to the s@xmath14 catalogue in fig .",
    "[ fig : de - zotti - counts - combined ] .",
    "all sources with @xmath59  mjy were selected from the simulation , and the source count was calculated in the same bins as for the observed count .",
    "the simulation under - predicts the observed number of sources in a similar way to the model .",
    "it is likely that this under - prediction is again due to a lack of flat spectrum sources in the model , as @xcite showed that the s@xmath14 and 10c spectral index distributions are significantly different , with the simulation missing almost all the flat spectrum sources .",
    "( note that the s@xmath14 and models are not entirely independent as they are both extrapolations from models constructed using low - frequency data . )",
    "@xcite used multi - wavelength data to show that these flat - spectrum 10c sources are probably the result of emission from the cores of radio galaxies , which therefore have a far greater contribution than predicted by either of the models discussed here .    below @xmath60  mjy there is a better agreement between the observed and simulated counts due to a slight flattening in the s@xmath14 counts .",
    "this flattening is due to the greater contribution of starforming sources ( both quiescent and starbursting ) to the simulated catalogue below @xmath60  mjy ; starforming sources comprise 21 per cent of the simulated sources with @xmath61 , compared to only 7 per cent of sources with @xmath62  mjy .",
    "however , given that there is no flattening in the new ami count , it is not clear what contribution , if any , a population of starforming sources is making to the observed counts at @xmath46  mjy .    a study of the multi - wavelength properties of 10c sources in the lockman hole @xcite used radio - to - optical ratios to show that at least 94 per cent of the 10c sample ( @xmath63  mjy ) are radio loud , demonstrating that there is no significant population of starforming galaxies present at these flux density levels .",
    "given that there is no change in the slope of the source count for @xmath64 , it seems unlikely that starforming galaxies are making a significantly greater contribution in this flux density range than at higher flux densities .",
    "therefore , the population of starforming galaxies predicted to be making a significant contribution ( @xmath65 per cent ) in this flux density range by the s@xmath14 simulation do not appear to be present .",
    "this is consistent with the results of several recent studies of the faint ( @xmath66  mjy ) source population at lower frequencies @xcite which have also found fewer starforming galaxies than predicted by the simulation .",
    "this paper presents new very deep ( best rms noise = 16  @xmath43jy beam@xmath17 ) 15.7-ghz observations in two fields .",
    "these are the deepest high - frequency radio observations to date , and enable us to calculate the source counts down to @xmath67  mjy .",
    "this is a factor of five deeper than previously achieved with the 10c survey .",
    "the source counts are consistent with the extrapolated fit to the 10c count .",
    "there is thus no evidence for a new population of objects contributing to the 15.7-ghz source counts above 0.1  mjy , suggesting that the high - frequency radio sky continues to be dominated by radio galaxies down to at least this flux density level .",
    "we do not observe the population of starforming galaxies predicted to begin to contribute @xmath64 by the s@xmath14 simulation .",
    "comparisons with the model and s@xmath14 simulation show that both these underestimate the observed number of sources at low flux densities by a factor of two .",
    "this is probably due to the flat - spectrum cores of radio galaxies contributing more significantly to the counts than predicted by the models .",
