    "competition is ubiquitous in physical , biological , sociological , and economical processes .",
    "examples include ordering kinetics where large domains grow at the expense of small ones @xcite , evolution where fitter species thrive at the expense of weaker species @xcite , social stratification where humans vie for social status @xcite , and the business world where companies compete for market share @xcite .",
    "the world of sports provides an ideal laboratory for modeling competition because game data are accurate , abundant , and accessible .",
    "moreover , since sports competitions are typically head - to - head , sports can be viewed as an interacting particle system , enabling analogies with physical systems that evolve via binary interactions @xcite .",
    "for instance , sports nicely demonstrate that the outcome of a single competition is not predictable @xcite . over the past century",
    "the lower seeded team had an astounding @xmath9 chance of defeating a higher seeded team in baseball @xcite .",
    "the same is true for other competitions in arts , science , and politics .",
    "this inherent randomness has profound consequences .",
    "even after a long series of competitions , the best team does not always finish first .    to understand how randomness affects the outcome of multiple competitions ,",
    "we study an idealized system . in our model league",
    ", there are @xmath1 teams ranked from best to worst , so that in each match there is a well - defined favorite and underdog .",
    "we assume that the weaker team can defeat the stronger team with a fixed probability . using random walk properties and scaling techniques analogous to those used in polymer physics @xcite",
    ", we study the rank of the champion as a function of the number of teams and the number of games .",
    "we find that a huge number games , @xmath10 , is needed to guarantee that the best team becomes the champion .",
    "we suggest that a more efficient strategy to decide champions is to set up preliminary rounds where a small number of games is played and based on the outcome of these games , only the top teams advance to the next round . in the final championship round ,",
    "@xmath11 teams play a sufficient number of @xmath12 games to decide the champion .",
    "using @xmath3 carefully constructed preliminary rounds , the required number of games , @xmath4 , can be reduced significantly @xmath13 remarkably , it is possible to approach the optimal limit of linear scaling using a large number of preliminary rounds .",
    "our model league consists of @xmath1 teams that compete in head - to - head matches .",
    "we assume that each team has an innate strength and that no two teams are equal .",
    "the teams are ranked from @xmath14 ( the best team ) to @xmath1 ( the worst team ) .",
    "this ranking is fixed and does not evolve with time .",
    "the teams play a fixed number of head - to - head games , and each game produces a winner and a loser . in our model , the stronger ( lower seed ) team is considered to be the favorite and the weaker ( higher seed ) team is considered to be the underdog . the outcome of each match is stochastic : the underdog wins with the upset probability @xmath15 and the favorite wins with the complementary probability @xmath16 .",
    "the team with the largest number of wins is the champion .",
    "since the better team does not necessarily win a game , the best team does not necessarily win the championship . in this study",
    ", we address the following questions : how many games are needed for the best team to finish first ?",
    "what is the typical rank of a champion decided by a relatively small number of games ?",
    "what is the optimal way to choose a champion ?",
    "we answer these questions using scaling techniques . consider the @xmath17th ranked team with @xmath18 .",
    "this team is inferior to a fraction @xmath19 of the @xmath20 remaining teams and superior to a fraction @xmath21 of the teams .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath22 that this team wins a game against a randomly chosen opponent is a linear combination of the probabilities @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 using @xmath16 , the probability @xmath22 can be rewritten as follows @xmath26 the latter varies linearly with rank : it is largest for the best team , @xmath27 , and smallest for the worst team , @xmath28 .",
    "now , suppose that the @xmath17th team plays @xmath29 games , each against a randomly chosen opponent .",
    "the number of wins it accumulates , @xmath30 , is a random quantity that grows as follows @xmath31 the initial condition is @xmath32 .",
    "the number of wins performs a biased random walk and as a result , when the number of games is large , the quantity @xmath30 is well - characterized by its average and its standard deviation @xmath33 , defined via . here",
    ", the brackets denote averaging over infinitely many realizations of the random process .",
    "since the outcome of a game is completely independent of all other games , the average number of wins and the variance in the number of wins are both proportional to the number of games played    @xmath34    both of these quantities follow from the behavior after one game : since @xmath35 with probability @xmath22 and @xmath36 with probability @xmath37 , then .",
    "moreover , the distribution of the number of wins is binomial and for large @xmath29 , it approaches a gaussian , fully characterized by the average and the standard deviation @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be used to understand key features of this system .",
    "let us assume that each team plays @xmath29 games against randomly selected opponents and compare the best team with the @xmath17th ranked team . since @xmath40 , the best team accumulates wins at a faster rate , and after playing sufficiently many games , the best team should be ahead .",
    "however , since there is a diffusive - like uncertainty in the number of wins , , it is possible that the @xmath17th ranked team has more wins when @xmath29 is small .",
    "the number of wins of the @xmath17th team is comparable with that of the best team as long as @xmath41 , or @xmath42 since the diffusion coefficient @xmath43 in ( [ wn ] ) varies only weakly with @xmath17 , @xmath44 , this dependence is tacitly ignored .",
    "when these two teams have a comparable number of wins , they have comparable chances to finish first . hence , eq",
    ".  ( [ compare ] ) yields the characteristic rank of the champion , @xmath45 , as a function of the number of teams @xmath1 and the number of games @xmath29 @xmath46 since we are primarily interested in the behavior as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath1 , the dependence on the probability @xmath23 is henceforth left implicit . as expected , the champion becomes stronger as the number of games increases ( recall that small @xmath17 represents a stronger team ) . by substituting @xmath47 into ( [ nt ] ) , we deduce that the total number of games , @xmath48 , needed for the best team to win is @xmath49 .",
    "since each of the @xmath1 teams plays @xmath50 games , the total number of games required for the best team to emerge as the champion with high certainty grows as the cubic power of the number of teams , @xmath51 this result has significant implications . in most sports leagues , two teams",
    "face each other a fixed number of times , usually once or twice .",
    "the corresponding total number of @xmath52 games , is much smaller than ( [ tn ] ) . in this common league format , the typical rank of the champion scales as @xmath53 .",
    "such a season is much too short as it enables weak teams to win championships .",
    "indeed , it is not uncommon for the top two teams to trade places until the very end of the season or for two teams to tie for first , a clear indication that the season length is too short .",
    "we may also consider the probability distribution @xmath54 for the @xmath17th ranked team to win after @xmath29 games .",
    "we expect that the scale @xmath45 characterizes the entire distribution function , @xmath55 assuming @xmath56 is finite , the probability that the best team wins scale as follows , @xmath57 .",
    "this quantity first grows , when @xmath58 , and then , it saturates , @xmath59 when @xmath60 .    the likelihood of major upsets is quantified by the tail of the scaling function @xmath61 .",
    "generally , the champion wins @xmath62 games ( we neglect the diffusive correction ) .",
    "the probability that the weakest team becomes champion by reaching that many wins is where the asymptotic behavior follows from the stirling formula .",
    "we conclude that the probability of the weakest team winning decays exponentially with the number of games , @xmath63 . yet , from ( [ qn - scaling ] ) and ( [ nt ] ) , @xmath64 , and therefore , the tail of the probability distribution is gaussian @xmath65 as @xmath66 thereby implying that upset champions are extremely improbable .",
    "we note that single - elimination tournaments produce upset champions with a much higher probability because the corresponding distribution function has an algebraic tail @xcite .",
    "we conclude that leagues have a much narrower range of outcomes and in this sense , leagues are more fair than tournaments .",
    "with such a large number of games , the ordinary league format is highly inefficient .",
    "how can we devise a schedule that produces the best team as the champion with the least number of games ?",
    "the answer involves preliminary rounds . in a preliminary round ,",
    "teams play a small number of games and only the top teams advance to the next round .",
    "let us consider a two stage format .",
    "the first stage is a preliminary round where teams play @xmath67 games and then , the teams are ranked according to the outcome of these games .",
    "the top @xmath68 teams advance to the final round @xcite , and the rest are eliminated .",
    "the final championship round proceeds via a league format with plenty of games to guarantee that the best team ends up at the top .",
    "we assume that the number of teams advancing to the second round grows sub - linearly @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "of course , we better not eliminate the best team .",
    "the number of games @xmath67 required for the top team to finish no worse than @xmath11th place is obtained by substituting @xmath71 into ( [ nt ] ) , @xmath72 .",
    "since each of the @xmath1 teams plays @xmath67 games , the total number of games in the preliminary round is of the order .",
    "directly from ( [ tn ] ) , the number of games in the final round is @xmath73 .",
    "adding these two contributions , the total number of games , @xmath74 , is @xmath75 this quantity grows algebraically with the number of teams , @xmath76 with @xmath77 and this exponent is minimal , @xmath78 , when @xmath79 consequently , @xmath80 .",
    "thus , it is possible to significantly improve upon the ordinary league format using a two - stage procedure . the first stage is a preliminary round in which each of the @xmath1 teams plays @xmath81 games and then the top @xmath82 teams advance to the final round .",
    "the rest of the teams are eliminated .",
    "the first preliminary round requires @xmath83 games . in the final round",
    "the remaining teams play in a league with each of the possible @xmath84 pairs of teams playing each other @xmath11 times . again",
    "the number of games is @xmath83 so that in total , @xmath85 games are played .",
    "this is a substantial improvement over ordinary @xmath86 league play .",
    "multiple preliminary rounds further reduce the number of games . introducing an additional round ,",
    "there are now three stages : the first preliminary round , the second preliminary round , and the championship round . out of the first round @xmath87 teams proceed to the second round and then",
    ", @xmath88 teams proceed to the championship round .",
    "the total number of games @xmath89 is a straightforward generalization of ( [ t1-eq ] ) @xmath90 these three terms account respectively for the first round , the second round , and the final round .",
    "the first term is analogous to the first term in ( [ t1-eq ] ) , and the last two terms are obtained by replacing @xmath1 with @xmath87 in ( [ t1-eq ] ) .",
    "the total number of games is minimal when all three terms are of the same magnitude .",
    "comparing the last two terms gives @xmath91 and therefore , ( [ alpha1 ] ) is recovered .",
    "comparing the first two terms gives @xmath92 thus , @xmath93 and since @xmath94 , the first elimination is less drastic then the second one .",
    "the total number of games , @xmath95 , represents a further improvement .",
    "these results indicate that it is possible to systematically reduce the total number of games via successive preliminary rounds that lead to the final championship round . in the most general case , there are @xmath3 preliminary rounds in addition to the final round .",
    "the number of teams advancing to the second round , @xmath96 , grows as follows @xmath97 from ( [ alpha2-eq ] ) , the exponent @xmath98 obeys the recursion relation @xmath99 or equivalently , @xmath100 by using @xmath101 we deduce the initial element in this series , @xmath102 .",
    "introducing the transformation @xmath103 reduces ( [ alpha - eq ] ) to the fibonacci - like recursion .",
    "the general solution of this equation is where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the two roots of the quadratic equation @xmath106 .",
    "the coefficients follow from the zeroth element : @xmath102 implies @xmath107 and consequently , @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath109 the exponent @xmath110 ( for @xmath111 ) decreases exponentially to one ( table 1 ) .",
    "this means that the number of teams advancing from the first to the second preliminary round is increasing with the total number of preliminary rounds played .",
    "nonetheless , the fraction of teams that are eliminated @xmath112 converges to one as @xmath113 .",
    "hence , nearly all of the teams are eliminated in large leagues .",

    "using @xmath119 , we arrive at our main result ( [ tk ] ) where @xmath120 .",
    "surprisingly , the total number of games is roughly linear in the number of teams @xmath121 when a large number of preliminary rounds is used , i.e. , @xcite .",
    "clearly , this linear scaling is optimal since every team must play at least once .",

    "the analysis in section iii reveals that the total number of games scales linearly , @xmath158 , and consequently , @xmath159 .",

    "in summary , we studied dynamics of league competition with fixed team strength and a finite upset probability .",
    "we demonstrated that ordinary league play where all teams play an equal number of games requires a very large number of games for the best team to win with certainty .",
    "we also showed that a series of preliminary rounds with a small but sufficient number games to successively eliminate the weakest teams is a fair and efficient way to identify the champion .",
    "we obtained scaling laws for the number of advancing teams and the number of games in each preliminary round .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to determine the best team by having teams play , on average , only a finite number of games ( independent of league size ) .",
    "the optimal size of the final championship round scales as the one - third power of the number of teams .",
    "empirical validation of these results with real data may be possible using sports leagues , for example .",
    "the challenge is that the inherent strength of each team is not known . in professional sports",
    ", a team s budget can serve as a proxy for its strength . with this definition , the average rank of the american baseball world series champion , over the past 30 years , equals 6 .",

    "leadership statistics is a challenging extreme statistics problem because the record of one team constrains the records of all other teams .",
    "our scaling approach , based on the record a fixed team , ignores such correlations .",
    "while these correlations do not affect the scaling laws , they do affect the distribution of outcomes such as the distribution of the rank of the winner , and the distribution of the number of games needed for the best team to take the lead for good .",
