    "magnetic properties of strongly correlated transition - metal compounds and their relation to doping , lattice geometry , band structure and interaction parameters are still being extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "in particular , the details of magnetic order in the ground state remain to be examined both theoretically and experimentally . during recent decades",
    ", the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case closely related to the problem of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates and iron arsenides has been intensively investigated theoretically .",
    "however , the more widespread case of three - dimensional compounds is not yet sufficiently understood . in general , the following factors should be taken into account to state an appropriate physical picture of the magnetism formation : ( i ) spiral magnetism , ( ii ) phase separation , ( iii ) electron correlation impact , ( iv ) multiorbital effects .",
    "the single - band hubbard model provides a sufficient basis for an analysis of complex magnetic properties . in the case of a large coulomb interaction parameter the ground state of single - band model in the half - filled case for bipartite lattices is a nel antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator .",
    "the types of the antiferromagnetic state instability in the presence of doping or the finite integral of the electron transfer between the second neighbors are still incompletely revealed . according to the classical work by nagaoka@xcite , on addition of one excess charge carrier",
    "the ground state on the bipartite lattice becomes saturated ferromagnetic ( fm ) .",
    "this statement can be also considered as a reasonable hypothesis in the case of small finite doping  @xcite . at the same time , for the non - bipartite ( e.g. , fcc and hcp ) lattices the ground state can be more complicated @xcite . for finite doping , the ferromagnetic state can become non - saturated @xcite .",
    "scenarios of the possible doping - induced magnetic ordering include the phase separation ( ps ) of different types : into the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases  @xcite or the phase of superconducting electron liquid and the nel antiferromagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is the formation of a spiral ( incommensurate ) magnetic state .",
    "it was considered within different approaches : the analysis of the momentum dependence of the generalized static magnetic susceptibility for the bare spectrum  @xcite , the hartree ",
    "fock approximation ( hfa ) ( with small and moderate @xmath1 values considered , where @xmath0 is the coulomb repulsion parameter and @xmath2 is the bandwidth )  @xcite and the @xmath3 model ( large @xmath1 values )  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that within simple hfa - like approaches the paramagnetic ( pm ) state is , as a rule , less favorable than the magnetic ones , which seems unreasonable because the pm phase is dominant in the ground state for the majority of transition metal compounds .",
    "another issue is investigating competition of the collinear , incommensurate and commensurate ( fm and afm ) phases .",
    "non  uniform phase - separated states are observed in both 2d and 3d magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of antiferromagnetic or spiral magnetic structures makes the classical problem of theoretical description of the formation of different types of magnetic order very urgent .",
    "spiral structures are observed in both two- and three - dimensional compounds : in iron - based high - temperature superconductors  @xcite and fcc iron precipitates  @xcite , mnsi systems  @xcite , itinerant compounds y@xmath4fe@xmath5 and lu@xmath4fe@xmath5@xcite where helical magnetism is induced by pressure .",
    "incommensurate structures are found in afm chromium  @xcite . in doped cuprates such states",
    "are observed as the dynamic magnetic order  @xcite . besides , considerably enhanced incommensurate magnetic fluctuations are observed in strontium ruthenates at low temperatures  @xcite ( see discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although spiral states were widely theoretically studied , the relation between the type of magnetic order and the model parameters has not been still clearly determined .",
    "in addition , there is a question about the possibility of the inhomogeneous state formation in a broad sense : either via magnetic phase separation or via so - called stripes .",
    "the latter structures , representing a mixed charge - spin order , are widely discussed for 2d high-@xmath6 superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the magnetic phase diagram of the 2d hubbard model taking into account the electron transfer integral only between the nearest neighbors , @xmath7 , within hfa shows that the spiral magnetic states occur in a wide range of parameters , especially at moderate values of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that inclusion of the electron transfer between the second neighbors , @xmath9 , in the hamiltonian changes considerably the ground - state magnetic phase diagram .",
    "it was established that the inhomogeneous stripe structures can be more energetically favorable than the spiral states at @xmath9 in the slave - boson approximation  @xcite , as well as at @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the hartree ",
    "fock approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion is somewhat devaluated by disregarding the intersite coulomb interaction which can considerably increase the energy of the stripes .",
    "last decades , the dynamical mean  field theory ( dmft ) has been intensively developed and became a powerful tool for the solution of quantum many ",
    "body problems @xcite .",
    "being well justified in the limit of large space dimensionality @xmath12 , it takes into account local correlations exactly , which can , in principle , provide some unbiased solution of the problem of ground magnetic state in the hubbard model . in refs .   a dmft generalization to spiral magnetic states",
    "was proposed .",
    "a typical hfa pattern of phase transitions between commensurate and incommensurate magnetic states with doping was reproduced for the square lattice .",
    "a novel so - called inhomogeneous dmft based approach was proposed in ref .   to study magnetic state formation for a rather large cluster .",
    "the collinear stripe - like spin - density wave states were found at finite doping and the magnetic phase diagram for the square lattice was constructed .    another convenient approach to study",
    "the magnetic order formation with account of correlations is the slave - boson approximation ( sba ) by kotliar and ruckenstein  @xcite within the hubbard model .",
    "it yields a simple ( in computational sense ) method taking into account the crucial difference between the single and double site states on the mean - field level and allows a thermodynamical description of the magnetic phase transition physics . in the saddle point approximation , this method is qualitatively similar to the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy obtained within the slave - boson method is in a good agreement with the quantum monte - carlo and exact diagonalization calculations  @xcite .",
    "this justifies the use of the slave - boson method in the cases where there are no strong fluctuations of the order parameter in the system . in the opposite case of the continuous ( second - order ) phase transition , where strong fluctuations occur , the nontrivial many - particle renormalizations of the green s functions can be important  @xcite .",
    "the effect of electron correlations on the stability of spiral magnetic states was considered in  @xcite using the sba by kotliar and ruckenstein .",
    "the phase diagram of the hubbard model was built in the nearest - neighbor approximation ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "derivation of the static magnetic susceptibility in sba @xcite allowed one to obtain a criterion for the pm state instability with respect to the second - order transition into an incommensurate magnetic state .",
    "this generalizes the analogous criterion obtained within the random phase approximation  @xcite to the strongly correlated states .",
    "using the generalized criterion , the finite @xmath13 case was studied and a considerable tendency to fm ordering at hole doping and large @xmath14 values was found  @xcite . however , the phase transitions between magnetically ordered states , as well as all first - order transitions can not be studied within this approach .",
    "the slave - boson approach can be generalized to take into account the multi ",
    "orbital local interaction part of the hamiltonian with an indirect connection between the corresponding eigenstates and slave - bosons states  @xcite .",
    "the method proposed ( the so - called spin - rotation - invariant sba ) yields the effective momentum dependence of the green s function residue which is missing in the traditional slave - boson approaches .",
    "recently , a successful combination of the slave - boson approximation and the local density approximation ( lda ) was used for the first - principle investigations of real compounds  @xcite as a numerically inexpensive way for qualitatively correct treatment of the electron correlation in the electron spectrum beyond lda .",
    "further investigations generalized the method for the study of superconductivity  @xcite , the physical picture being similar to that obtained within multiorbital lda+dmft approach .",
    "the excitation spectrum in the 3d case differs essentially from the 2d case , and finite  temperature behavior can be hardly described by sb method .",
    "however , in the ground state the sb approach seems to be useful . to generalize the sba to the case of finite temperatures the gaussian fluctuations",
    "can be included , e.g.  in the framework of statistically consistent gutzwiller approximation ( sga ) @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply both the non - correlated mean - field ( hartree  fock ) approximation and the slave - boson approximation to the magnetic ordering of different types ( ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and spiral ) within 2d and 3d hubbard model and compare the results . in section  [",

    "before proceeding to the results obtained we need to mention the main physical factors that are important for the incommensurate magnetic states formation starting from paramagnetic phase .",
    "there are two well known mechanisms leading to stabilization of incommensurate states : ( i ) fermi surface nesting and ( ii ) van hove scenario .",
    "\\(i ) fermi surface nesting is the presence of large segments of a fermi surface that can be connected to other segments via a nesting vector @xmath107 in such a way that occupied states move to the empty states region and vice versa .",
    "when the nesting condition @xmath108 is realized for many @xmath102-points the magnetic susceptibility function @xmath109 is enhanced or has a singularity leading to stabilization of the incommensurate magnetic state with wave vector @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "one can mention that the nesting condition means @xmath110 in our formalism ( see ( [ eq : esa ] ) ) .",
    "this results in cancellation of the symmetric terms in spectra @xmath111 ( [ eq : subband_spectrum ] ) , and hence the @xmath23-dependence of @xmath111 becomes appreciably suppressed .",
    "thus we come to an important conclusion that the fermi surface nesting makes the system to some extent insensitive to the correlation effects . in the fm case @xmath112 and",
    "the nesting condition reduces to @xmath113 .",
    "this means that the larger is the density of states at a given @xmath64 , the weaker is the influence of electron correlations on the fm state .",
    "\\(ii ) another mechanism leading to the incommensurate magnetic structure formation was proposed in ref .  .",
    "the authors have shown that the presence of saddle points in the electron spectrum results in the divergence of susceptibility ( [ eq : susceptibility ] ) if @xmath107 is equal to a vector connecting the saddle points to each other .",
    "the result was obtained for the 2d case but one can expect that it holds true for the 3d case as well with a possible change of the divergence into a weak singularity .",
    "this mechanism demonstrates the importance of van hove singularities ( given by the saddle points ) for magnetism .",
    "thus , when analyzing the magnetic phase diagrams , special attention should be paid to the density of states , nesting properties of the fermi surface , and van hove singularities .",
    "we calculated the phase diagrams of the ground state at different @xmath14 values within the hartree ",
    "fock approximation in  ref .  ;",
    "the results for @xmath10 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : square_t=0]a . an analogous phase diagram obtained within sba is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : square_t=0]b  @xcite ( we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath114 due to the particle  hole symmetry , see justification below ) .",
    "since sba takes into account the impact of many - electron states onto the one - electron spectrum on the static level , we can treat these sba corrections as correlation effects beyond hfa .",
    "note that for both these approaches the phase transitions between different magnetic states are generally first - order transitions , which leads to considerable regions of phase separation .",
    "this also applies to the transition from afm to spiral state at arbitrary small doping , which is of the first order due to that the insulator finite - gap state goes abruptly to the metallic phase ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the account of ps substantially distinguishes the phase diagram obtained within sba from that presented in ref .  , where ps was disregarded .",
    "the separation regions between the afm phase and the spiral magnetic states ( parallel , @xmath115 , and diagonal , @xmath116 ) are rather wide ; the corresponding regions of pure spiral states are narrowed .",
    "in particular , this refers to the diagonal phase , the existence of which becomes possible only at @xmath117 .",
    "the phase transition between the pm and spiral magnetic states is of the second order .",
    "the magnitude of _ number _ @xmath99 in the regions of spiral states is variable but qualitatively it behaves as shown in fig .",

    "the fm state covering a considerable part of the diagram within hfa is shifted to the region of large values @xmath121 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that sba yields a convenient scheme of interpolation between the small @xmath0 limit ( coinciding with hfa ) and the large @xmath0 limit ( @xmath122 as the limit consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : main_p ] ) ) in the case @xmath73 ; whereas hfa yields only saturated ferromagnetism at large @xmath0 for finite doping .",
    "the suppression of fm state reproduces the result obtained in ref .",
    "and is in good agreement with the variational study of the stability of the saturated fm phase  @xcite .",
    "the region of separation of the afm and spiral phases is narrowed by about one half ( with respect to the variable @xmath58 ) .    according to our calculations , even an unrestricted increase of @xmath0",
    "does not make the magnetically ordered states stable far from half - filling : at @xmath123 , there are no spiral magnetic solutions of the slave - boson method equations at @xmath124 . at the same time , the saturated fm solution becomes more favorable than the spiral ones only at @xmath125 .",
    "this improves the result proposed in ref .  , where spiral phases were not considered ; similar phase diagram was obtained in ref .",

    "thus , at large @xmath0 values far from half - filling the spiral magnetic state replaces the saturated fm one .",

    "far from half - filling , the van hove singularities stabilize the ferromagnetic order , especially in the 2d case .",
    "the correlation effects are shown to be negligible for the fm state in the case of a large density of states , and for the spiral states provided that the fermi surface nesting with corresponding @xmath262 is present .",
    "the most important among the bounded singularities are those produced by the saddle points which do not correspond to high symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "they favor stabilization of incommensurate spiral states and usually lead to an increase in the density of states .",
    "the value of wave vector @xmath262 is equal to a vector connecting two of the saddle points in these cases .",
    "when the system is far from half - filling and the fermi level is far from van hove singularities , the magnetic state can not form at any @xmath0 .    a recent series of papers @xcite concerns the formation of spiral magnetic order in a specific many - band model ( two - band rice model  @xcite ) with imperfect nesting between the hole and electron fermi surface pockets .",
    "the general result of these investigations is that there exists a first order transition between commensurate and incommensurate magnetic states which invokes a phase separation between them .",
    "thus the phase separation is a more general phenomenon and the existence of two nested fermi surfaces is not necessary .",
