    "et al_. @xcite carried out experiments on electron transmission through a finite biperiodic gaas / algaas superlattice consisting of alternating types of unit cells .",
    "biperiodic systems occur naturally in crystals and polymers @xcite , but in layered semiconductor heterostructures one has control over the properties of the cells . as illustrated by the red ( solid ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , coquelin s system had identical barriers of width @xmath2 nm , while there are two alternating well widths , @xmath3 nm ( wide ) and @xmath4 nm ( narrow ) , which changes it from a simply periodic to a biperiodic system .",
    "we will consider the basic unit , called a half - cell , to comprise three layers : two well segments of gaas having widths @xmath5 separated by an algaas barrier of width @xmath6 .",
    "a full or ",
    "double - cell \" consists of a half - cell plus another which is its mirror image . the double - cell of width @xmath7 centered on the origin ,",
    "is marked in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] at the left of the three - cell array , in red .",
    "it has layers of widths @xmath8 and is overall reflection symmetric about its mid - point .",
    "due to the two barriers enclosing a well of width @xmath9 , there will be quasi - bound states which show up as resonances in electron scattering from the double cell .",
    "when @xmath10 such cells are juxtaposed , the wells will be alternately wide and narrow ; hence the name biperiodic array .",
    "each double cell is a symmetric cell , and the complete array has reflection symmetry . by exchanging the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "the character of the array will change from say @xmath13 to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for wide and narrow wells respectively .",
    "the experimental device @xcite had @xmath17 double cells , so there were @xmath18 wells enclosed between barriers .",
    "this number was chosen because it provides enough separation between the measured transmission resonances for them to be distinguished . when @xmath19 , the simply periodic system of @xmath0 symmetric cells is known @xcite to exhibit @xmath20 transmission resonances in each allowed band , according to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bloch phase of the half - cell , and @xmath23 is its impedance parameter in the kard parameterization eq .",
    "( [ eq : bip10 ] ) of the transfer matrix@xcite .",
    "the fundamental band structure depends on those properties of the half - cell , while the width and spacing of individual resonances depends on the number @xmath10 of half - cells , via @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "of three double - cells , each of width @xmath26 ; short - dashed ( blue ) line an additional half - cell could be added at right , creating an additional narrow well as discussed in sec .",
    "iv.,width=302 ]    when @xmath27 , the half - cell is asymmetric under reflection , though the double cell remains symmetric .",
    "each allowed band develops a band gap near the bragg point @xmath28 .",
    "an allowed band of the @xmath17 double - cell system should show two resonances . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , one of the allowed bands contains a third resonance which we will identify as a transparent state at which the impedance parameter @xmath29 , causing the envelope of minimum transmission probability to be pushed up to unity .",
    "such a state occurs at a fixed energy , independent of the number of double cells included , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : bip01 ] .",
    "this transparent state lies very close to a band edge , in the lower ( upper ) split band when the wide ( narrow ) well is first in line for incident electrons .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explain why and how the transparent state arises when the half - cell becomes asymmetric , and why it is located very close to the split band edge . in sec . iv we will consider the surprising effect of including an additional half cell , as suggested by the dashed blue line at the right in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "we will follow the line of argument of shockley @xcite , who studied surface states of a finite static periodic potential whose unit cell is symmetric about its mid - point .",
    "we extend his method to allow for the position and energy - dependent effective mass , required in a semiconductor superlattice .",
    "since the full cell has reflection symmetry , it is sufficient to solve the schrdinger equation for the half - cell @xmath30 .",
    "the even ( @xmath31 ) and odd ( @xmath32 ) parity solutions take the boundary values @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the origin . [ note : following the development of appendix a , the prime means take the derivative , and then divide by the variable factor @xmath35 to allow for the effective mass , @xmath36 , which is dimensionless . ]",
    "the transfer matrix for the half - cell is @xmath37 where the wave functions without argument are always evaluated at the point @xmath38 . placing the half - cells in reverse order ,",
    "simply interchanges the elements @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    since the wronskian of two solutions is a constant , @xmath41 . in dealing with a constant potential and constant @xmath42 , for example , one has @xmath43 which are chosen so that at @xmath44 ( well bottom ) , we have solutions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    for the symmetric double cell @xmath47 , the transfer matrix is @xmath48 to transform to the ingoing / outgoing waves representation we proceed as in appendix a with @xmath49 as the velocity outside the potential .",
    "unlike @xmath50 , the matrix @xmath51 operates from right to left .",
    "for the full cell it is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : a08 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     some results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] , for the same potential cell used in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , appropriate for gaas / algaas superlattices . to start",
    "we take @xmath52 half - cells .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the transmission in both parts of the split bands , with three resonances in each .",
    "one sees that the envelope of maxima , @xmath53 crosses the envelope of minima , @xmath54 , at the transparent point @xmath55 . from there to the band edge , they exchange their roles as upper / lower bounds .",
    "the upper bound reduces the maximum transmission by a large amount in comparison to the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , which is for six half - cells . in the forbidden band",
    ", it can be shown that what was the envelope of mimina becomes an upper bound on transmission , while the lower bound is zero .",
    "the cross - over at the transparent point ensures that these bounds are continuous .",
    "[ fig09](b ) shows detail near the transparent point .",
    "where the bounds cross , @xmath56 is pinched between them .",
    "to the left of the transparent point ( which it no longer is ! ) , the maxima occur when @xmath57 , with integer @xmath58 . from the third line of eq .",
    "[ eq : bip17 ] , any maxima that occur after the transparent point satisfy @xmath59 , with integer @xmath60 . such a situation must occur for a large enough @xmath10 , because the energy of the transparent point is fixed , while having more cells squeezes additional resonances into each allowed band . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show detail of the region near the lower edge of the upper band , for @xmath61 half - cells . here one of the resonances clearly lies between the band edge and the transparent state .",
    "innumerable papers have been written on symmetric periodic systems , for which the relation eq .",
    "[ eq : bip01 ] applies , and their resonances always involve perfect transmission . therefore it is a surprise to see how adding a half - cell introduces a non - trivial upper bound on transmission , greatly reducing it in the neighbourhood of the  transparent \" state .",
    "we have studied transmission through biperiodic semiconductor superlattices . for an even number of half - cells , asymmetry causes each allowed band to split at the bragg energy where @xmath62 . extending shockley s line of argument for a generic single - barrier cell",
    ", we have proved that this induces a transparent state which lies in one of the split bands , and very close to the band edge .",
    "the rule is that the transparent state lies in the lower band when the wide well is first in line for incident electrons .",
    "the transparent state is a resonance which occurs at a fixed energy , independent of the number of cells in the array ; otherwise the transmission follows the well known rule expressed in eq .",
    "[ eq : bip01 ] .    for an odd number of half cells ,",
    "the picture is completely different .",
    "these systems are asymmetric , so if there is a wide well first on the left , there will be a narrow well first from the right . the asymmetry due to the additional half - cell causes an envelope of maximum transmission to appear , which crosses the envelope of minimum transmission at the  transparent \" point , in both split bands .",
    "the transmission probability is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : bip17 ] and is bounded on both sides as in eq .",
    "[ eq : bip18 ] . at the transparent point @xmath63 ,",
    "the bounds cross , and the transmission probability is pinched between them .",
    "resonances occurring between the transparent state and the band edge satisfy a different rule , @xmath64 , not the @xmath65 which would follow from eq .",
    "[ eq : bip01 ] .    in a separate article",
    "we will discuss these systems in a tight binding model , showing what can and can not be reproduced in that approximation .",
    "for example , in tight binding , the transparent state occurs exactly at a band edge , rather than just inside .",
