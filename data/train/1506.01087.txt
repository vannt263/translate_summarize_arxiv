    "we remark that theorem [ unbounded ] in  [ sec : unimodal ] yields analogous examples to those given in theorem [ exrat ] above , in the context of polynomials .",
    "for instance , one can take @xmath538 , where @xmath539 $ ] denotes the infinitely renormalizable parameter for period doubling ( the so - called _ feigenbaum _ parameter ) . in that case",
    ", the neutral measure is the unique invariant measure supported in the closure of the post - critical set of @xmath1 , which is non - atomic as explained in section [ sec : unimodal ] .",
    "let @xmath540 $ ] be an irrational number , and consider the quadratic polynomial @xmath541 given by : @xmath542    the origin is a fixed point of @xmath543 , and @xmath544 has modulus one .",
    "let us assume that @xmath37 is of _ bounded type _",
    ", that is , there exists @xmath545 such that : @xmath546for any integers @xmath360 and @xmath547 . by a classical result of siegel @xmath543",
    "is _ linearizable _ around the origin : there exists a simply - connected component @xmath548 of the fatou set of @xmath543 , a _",
    "siegel disk _ , that contains the origin and where @xmath543 is conformally conjugate to its linear part @xmath549 , an irrational rotation acting on the unit disk .",
    "a famous theorem of douady @xcite ( see also the recent paper @xcite ) asserts that @xmath550 is a quasi - circle that contains the ( unique ) critical point of @xmath543 . moreover , there exist @xmath551 and a quasiconformal homeomorphism @xmath552 with @xmath553 and such that @xmath554 on @xmath555 , where @xmath529 is the blaschke product given by .",
    "in particular @xmath556 is a quasisymmetric homeomorphism which conjugates @xmath529 with @xmath543 . combining this with theorem [ exrat ] we get the following result .",
    "[ corosiegel ] let @xmath540 $ ] be an irrational number of bounded type , and let @xmath543 be the quadratic polynomial given by .",
    "then the harmonic measure on the boundary of the siegel disk @xmath548 , viewed from the origin , is a neutral measure for @xmath543 .",
    "corollary [ corosiegel ] follows from theorem [ exrat ] and the general fact that a quasiconformal conjugacy between rational maps preserves zero lyapunov exponents ( one way to see this is to combine koebe s distortion lemma with the fact that a quasiconformal homeomorphism is bi - hlder and the argument in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 8.3 ) ) .    more generally , the harmonic measure at the boundary of any siegel disk or at the boundary of any herman ring is a neutral measure , as stated in the introduction of @xcite . in particular , by taking some polynomial or rational function @xmath1 with a siegel disk whose boundary does not contain critical points ( for such an example see @xcite and the references therein ) we obtain @xmath514 such that @xmath521 , @xmath10 has no atoms and @xmath557 contains no critical point of @xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that for any rational function @xmath1 and any neutral measure @xmath10 we have that @xmath557 must be contained in the closure of the forward orbit of some critical point of @xmath1 , otherwise @xmath1 would be expanding on @xmath557 and then @xmath10 would not be neutral .    finally , let us mention that cortez and rivera - letelier have constructed in @xcite and @xcite real quadratic polynomials for which the @xmath531-limit set of the critical point is a minimal cantor set ( necessarily contained in the julia set ) supporting _ any prescribed _ number of neutral measures ( finite , countable infinite or uncountable ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the examples discussed above , where @xmath558 is uniquely ergodic .",
    "we conclude with some questions ( in addition to question [ expcrit ] posed at the end of section [ sec : proofofmain ] ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a rational map of the riemann sphere with degree greater than or equal to two , and let @xmath10 be a neutral measure for @xmath1 , that is , a non - atomic @xmath1-invariant ergodic borel probability measure , whose support is contained in the julia set of @xmath1 , and with lyapunov exponent equal to zero ( just as in the situation of theorem [ exrat ] ) .",
    "is it true that @xmath559 ?",
    "is @xmath558 a minimal dynamical system ?",
    "is it true , at least , that @xmath557 has no periodic orbits ?",
    "what are all the examples of rational maps having some non - atomic invariant ergodic borel probability measure , supported inside its julia set , and with zero lyapunov exponent ?    a difficult problem in the context of critical circle maps with finitely many critical points is the one of _",
    "geometric rigidity_. more precisely , let @xmath1 and @xmath560 be two orientation preserving @xmath0 circle homeomorphisms with the same irrational rotation number , and with @xmath241 non - flat critical points of odd type .",
    "denote by @xmath561 the ordered critical set of @xmath1 , by @xmath562 the ordered critical set of @xmath560 , and suppose that the criticalities of @xmath243 and @xmath563 are the same for all @xmath564 ( the cubic case is the generic one ) .",
    "finally , denote by @xmath565 and @xmath566 the corresponding unique invariant measures of @xmath1 and @xmath560 .    by yoccoz s result @xcite we know that @xmath1 and @xmath560 are topologically conjugate to each other . by elementary reasons ,",
    "the condition @xmath567\\big)=\\mu_g\\big([c'_i , c'_{i+1}]\\big)$ ] for all @xmath568 is necessary ( and sufficient ) in order to have a topological conjugacy between @xmath1 and @xmath560 that sends the critical points of @xmath1 to the critical points of @xmath560 . under this assumption",
    ", it turns out that this conjugacy is in fact a _ quasisymmetric _ homeomorphism .",
    "this follows from a recent general result of clark and van strien @xcite . in this context",
    "it also follows from the real bounds ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.6 ) for the case of a single critical point , and the forthcoming article @xcite for the multicritical case ) .",
    "[ qs ] is this conjugacy a smooth diffeomorphism ?    in the case of exactly one critical point",
    "this question has been answered in the affirmative , in the real - analytic category .",
    "this is due to the efforts of several mathematicians during the last twenty years ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a positive answer was recently obtained also in the @xmath0 category ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . to the best of our knowledge , the case of more than one critical point remains completely open .",
    "we wish to thank juan rivera - letelier for very useful comments about section [ ratapp ] , especially for pointing to us corollary [ corosiegel ] .",
    "we are also grateful to trevor clark , gabriela estevez , katrin gelfert , mario ponce and charles tresser for several conversations about these and related matters .",
    "finally , we would like to thank the anonymous referee for his / her keen remarks and questions , which have lead to a considerable improvement of our paper .",
