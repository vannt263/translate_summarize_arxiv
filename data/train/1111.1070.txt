    "the modern cosmological concordance model has been spectacularly successful .",
    "this success has come at a price , however : cosmologists must postulate a universe in which the vast majority of the content , in the form of dark matter and dark energy , is inaccessible to direct observation .",
    "gravitational lensing , and weak lensing in particular , provide our best window onto the dark universe . because of this , the astronomical community is investing heavily in current and future imaging surveys , both ground- and space - based , designed at least in part around weak lensing science , e.g. , the dark energy survey ( des ) , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , the hyper suprime cam for the _ subaru _ telescope , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , and euclid .",
    "lensing measurements have already played a significant role in astrophysics in the last two decades over a range of scales and physical regimes .",
    "weak lensing measurements have characterized the aggregate properties of galaxies dark matter haloes , ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the dark matter profiles of large galaxy clusters , both on a cluster - by - cluster basis ( e.g. , @xcite ) and for stacked galaxy groups and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and , with recent cosmic shear detections @xcite , directly measured the clustering of matter on cosmological scales .",
    "these measurements are currently made almost exclusively by studying spatially - correlated distortions in the ellipticities of background galaxies due to the shear component of the gravitational lensing distortion . in the weak - lensing regime ,",
    "the ellipticities induced by lensing are small ( @xmath0% ) compared to the range of intrinsic galaxy ellipticities ( @xmath1% ) @xcite .",
    "the lensing distortion also magnifies background sources , but the intrinsic variance in the distribution of galaxy sizes and luminosities  those properties perturbed by magnification  is much larger than that of galaxy shapes .",
    "magnification measurements to date have necessarily had to average over much larger galaxy samples to obtain signal - to - noise ( s / n ) equivalent to shear measurements @xcite .    in this letter , we make use of a tight galaxy scaling relation  a photometry - only version of the well - known fundamental plane for early type galaxies @xcite  to substantially narrow the intrinsic distribution of sizes for a set of background source galaxies .",
    "this makes it possible to measure the weak lensing magnification signal around a set of foreground galaxy lenses with higher s /",
    "n than was previously thought possible @xcite . a thorough description of the methodology and implementation of this analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( hereafter paper ii ) . here",
    ", we describe the core concepts , present a detailed outline of the method , and demonstrate its effectiveness .    in section",
    "[ sec : photofp ] , we describe the scaling relation used in this analysis . in section [ sec : mag_measurement ] , we present a proof - of - concept measurement of weak lensing magnification using this technique and control for the most important systematic biases .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] with a brief discussion of the ways this method might be improved upon , with an eye toward extracting a lensing signal from magnification that equals or even exceeds the s / n obtainable from shear - based techniques . throughout",
    ", we assume a @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is in many ways an ideal tool for measuring magnification .",
    "it is an observed correlation between galaxy effective radius ( @xmath7 ) , which is magnified by gravitational lensing , and two galaxy properties which are unaltered by lensing : galaxy surface brightness ( @xmath8 ) and the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the fp is @xmath10 dex @xcite , or 20% .",
    "thus the fp makes it possible to predict the intrinsic value of @xmath7 from observations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which can then be compared with the observed values of @xmath7 to measure magnification .",
    "the fp was in fact proposed as a tool for this purpose by @xcite , but to our knowledge has never been used as such due to a critical flaw .",
    "placing galaxies on the fp requires @xmath9 measurements .",
    "even with the tight scatter in the fp , a statistically viable measurement would require high - resolution spectroscopic measurements for millions of galaxies .",
    "identifying a purely photometric analog to the fp with comparable scatter would solve this problem .",
    "such a relation has already been identified by @xcite , where the concentration of the galaxy light profile fills the role normally served by @xmath9 .",
    "this works in part because concentration and velocity dispersion are both strongly correlated with galaxy mass , and in part because at fixed mass , galaxies with more concentrated mass profiles have higher velocity dispersions .",
    "we will explore the relation between the spectroscopic fundamental plane and the photometric relation deployed here more fully in paper ii .      to define a photofp for this work",
    ", we use a sample of galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ) eighth data release ( dr8 , @xcite ) .",
    "we limit the sample to resolved sources that meet basic quality cuts ( e.g. , are not saturated ) . for these",
    ", we estimate photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath11 s ) based on the sdss _ ugriz _ photometry using the public code zebra @xcite run with the default templates , allowing interpolation between the standard templates without template optimization . to select a sample of early type background sources that should lie on the photofp",
    ", we exclude the @xmath12 of the galaxies with best - fitting templates inconsistent with that of a passive stellar population . the sample selection for background sources",
    "will be described in greater detail in paper ii .",

    "all reported quantities are measured in the _ r _ band .",
    "we fit a photofp of the form @xmath19 where @xmath7 is the half - light radius of the best - fit de vaucouleurs light profile converted into physical units using the zebra photo-@xmath11 , @xmath8 is the mean de vaucouleurs surface brightness within @xmath7 , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are free parameters . to avoid errors resulting from a redshift - dependent selection function , evolution in the photofp , and @xmath23-corrections to the radii due to the fact that the morphological measurements are all made in the observed - frame _ r _ band , we divide our galaxy sample into redshift bins with width @xmath14 and fit the photofp separately in each bin .",

    ", this implies an estimator @xmath36 of :    @xmath37    if the errors in the observables are uncorrelated , the variance in our estimator @xmath38 is just the variance in the photofp in the direction of @xmath7 .",
    "we extract a galaxy - galaxy lensing signal by cross - correlating this estimator with a population of foreground lenses .",
    "the lens sample is selected from the nyu value - added catalog @xcite version of the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) spectroscopic survey @xcite , using only luminous red galaxy sample targets ( lrgs , @xcite ) . in order to compare with the results of @xcite , we limit the sample to massive galaxies with absolute @xmath39-band magnitudes @xmath40 and redshifts @xmath41 .",
    "the magnitudes are @xmath42-corrected and evolution corrected to @xmath43 as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m+06 ) . finally , to exclude satellite galaxies that are not at the centers of their dark matter haloes , we remove galaxies with brighter nearby lrgs , again following m+06 .",
    "this gives a sample of @xmath44 lenses that have comparable properties to the combined lrg sample of m+06 .",
    "in the presence of photo - z errors , the overdensity of sources clustered near a lens will produce an excess of galaxies with incorrect photo - z ( @xmath45 ) along the line of sight to the lens . as a result ,",
    "when we average @xmath46 over the foreground or background source galaxies , we systematically mis - estimate the residuals from the plane associated with a lens due to the ` shadow ' cast by photo - z errors .    to deal with this bias",
    ", we will calculate the magnitude of this spurious signal directly from the data , and subtract it from our measured signal .",
    "we must first estimate the error in @xmath47 induced by a galaxy being assigned the wrong @xmath45 ( @xmath48 ) , then calculate what fraction @xmath49 of the galaxies at each @xmath45 have been scattered in from @xmath25 . in these terms , the observed mean photofp residual is : @xmath50 where @xmath26 is the true convergence .",
    "@xmath51 can be estimated by assuming that the galaxy lies on the photofp at @xmath25 but is incorrectly assigned to @xmath45 .",
    "the inferred effective radius of a galaxy with true redshift @xmath25 that is mistakenly assigned to @xmath45 will be off by a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "the surface brightness dimming correction will be similarly incorrect , with @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "finally , the photofp fits differ between redshift bins .",
    "a galaxy with an incorrect photo - z will therefore lie off the photofp in its assigned redshift bin by @xmath54 the expressions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the radii that would be predicted by the photofp for that galaxy s surface brightness and concentration in the bins corresponding to @xmath45 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 can be estimated by cross - correlating the positions of sources at @xmath45 with lenses at @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the positions of galaxies in widely separated redshift bins are uncorrelated and that any observed excess of sources far behind a lens is due to scattering from @xmath25 .",
    "this means that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the angular cross - correlation between the positions of sources at @xmath59 and lenses at @xmath25 .",
    "a cross - correlation signal of this form can also be produced by the boosted number counts of magnified background sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) but that effect is too weak to detect with a lens sample of this size .",
    "the cross - correlations for @xmath60 with a range of @xmath24 bins are shown in figure [ fig : delta_resid ] .",
    "we fit an angular correlation function of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are free parameters .",
    "the choice of power law index is motivated by the angular correlation function measurements of @xcite , which are in agreement with our observed @xmath64 .",
    "incorrectly estimating the true mean density of galaxies at @xmath45 will cause @xmath63 to deviate from unity , as is observed .",
    "we remove the effects of this uncertainty when calculating @xmath49 by setting @xmath65 .",
    "sources with @xmath66 ( above the black horizontal line in figure 2 ) are excluded from the lensing measurement , while sources with @xmath67 are corrected using equation [ eq : kappa_pzerr ] .",
    "in addition to the effects of galaxy clustering on photometric redshift errors , a mean offset between the true and photometric redshifts in a @xmath45 bin will cause an incorrect estimation of the critical density @xmath29 for all of the galaxies in that bin .",
    "this error depends on the distribution of foreground lens redshifts . using the method of @xcite",
    ", we estimate the effect of a mean shift in our photo - z s on the signal of no more than @xmath68 .",
    "this uncertainty is small relative to the other corrections discussed here , so we defer this calculation to paper ii .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline produces known sky subtraction proximity effects , where the photometry of objects near bright stars or galaxies is systematically biased ( c.f .",
    "this may induce a systematic bias in the estimated radii , surface brightnesses , and concentrations that contaminates the lensing signal .",
    "sky subtraction effects can not distinguish between foreground and background galaxies ( with respect to the bright lens ) , so this proximity bias can in principle be estimated from the photofp residuals for galaxies in the _ foreground _ of the lenses , which are unaffected by lensing .",
    "figure [ fig : sky_effects ] shows the average deviation from the photofp as a function of source - lens angular separation for both foreground and background sources .",
    "the sky proximity bias systematically induces a reduction in effective radius relative to the photofp trend .",
    "the lensing signal is thus the difference between the background and foreground photofp deviations at each angular separation . of note",
    "is the fact that our empirical sky correction extends beyond the size of the sdss sky subtraction box , which is @xmath69 ; this is a result of galaxy clustering .",
    "each of the bright objects used as a lens will tend to be associated with a galaxy overdensity on the sky .",
    "this excess will also impact the sky correction , even in neighboring sky subtraction cells , so the angular scale of the resulting correction will be set by the galaxy correlation function .",
    "the low redshift of the lens sample and the poor quality of the photo - z s ( which preferentially scatter higher-@xmath11 sources to lower @xmath11 ) result in a large fraction of source galaxies near lenses with photometric redshifts @xmath70 that are actually at @xmath71 .",
    "this means that a foreground sample of sources with photo - z s will be contaminated by objects from higher @xmath11 .",
    "the cut on @xmath72 described above removes many such contaminating galaxies , at the cost of dramatically reducing the signal - to - noise ratio of the sky proximity bias estimate .",
    "this remains the major source of uncertainty in this measurement .    as a check against this effect",
    ", we also show the deviation from the photofp trend of those foreground sources with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "any large bias to this sky subtraction estimate resulting from imperfect photo - z s should produce a substantial difference between the spectroscopic and photometric foreground estimates ; this is not observed .",
    "after controlling for the systematic errors described above , we calculate the line - of - sight surface matter density @xmath28 by weighting each lens  background source pair by the critical density for lensing , @xmath73 .",
    "we bin this density by physical separation in the lens plane .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ fig : sigma ] , along with existing measurements from m+06 for a similar lens population .",
    "the magnification signal demonstrated above , while many times stronger than previous magnification measurements , is still somewhat noisier than the shear signal for a comparable sample .",
    "this is because the convergence dispersion resulting from the measured photofp width is 35% ( 1.8 times larger than the intrinsic shear dispersion of 20% ) and because we have only used the third of the source sample consistent with early - type seds .    if the fundamental achievable limit for this technique is the intrinsic scatter in the _ spectroscopic _ fundamental plane , then the average magnification s / n for an early - type galaxy is the same as in shear ; a comparable photometric tully - fisher relation for late - type galaxies would bring us to the point where magnification and shear provide comparable information . and any improvement in our understanding of galaxy evolution and dynamics that further diminishes the scatter in these scaling relations will boost the magnification signal beyond that available for shear measurement .",
    "perhaps just as valuable , magnification by this method is not sensitive to the same systematic biases that challenge upcoming shear measurements .",
    "for instance , the intrinsic galaxy alignment signal on large scales should not affect galaxy sizes , concentrations , and mean surface brightnesses in same the manner in which it affects shapes .",
    "we expect that this technique will also prove useful in extracting and removing instrumental sytematics , such as those arising from variations in the telescope point - spread function , and will investigate this prospect in a subsequent paper .",
