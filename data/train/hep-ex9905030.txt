    "the study of the interference @xmath12 gives the independent evaluation of the @xmath3-meson leptonic width .",

    "the value of branching ratio of @xmath3-meson leptonic decay + @xmath13 was obtained . later",

    "the experiment was carried out with snd detector ( fig .  [ sndtrans ] ) at vepp-2 m in 19961997 .",
    "snd is a general purpose non - magnetic detector @xcite .",
    "the main part of the snd is a spherical electromagnetic calorimeter , consisting of 1630 nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "the solid angle of the calorimeter is @xmath14 of @xmath15 steradian .",
    "the angles of charged particles are        measured by two cylindrical drift chambers covering 95% of @xmath15 steradian solid angle .",

    "it utilizes the difference in total energy depositions and the longitudinal energy deposition profiles for electrons , pions and muons . as a result of this procedure",
    "the background from the process ( [ ee ] ) was suppressed down to 4% of the events of the process ( [ mumu ] ) . to suppress the contribution of the process ( [ pipi ] )",
    "a procedure of @xmath34 separation by the muon system has been used . in the energy range under study the probability to hit the muon system for a muon varies from 80 to 93% and is as low as 1.5% for pions of the process ( [ pipi ] ) .",
    "a requirement of a hit in the muon system also reduced the background from the process ( [ ee ] ) by two order of magnitude , making its contribution negligible .    after these cuts 80% of selected events are still cosmic background .",
    "the rejection of the events with the hit in two top segments of the muon system ( about @xmath35 in azimuth direction ) ( fig .",
    "[ sndtrans ] ) suppressed the cosmic events by two times .",

    "[ timefly ] shows the distribution of the time of flight @xmath37 .",
    "peaks in the spectra at @xmath48  ns and @xmath49  ns are due to the process ( [ mumu ] ) and cosmic background respectively .    to subtract the cosmic background",
    "the combination of the independent parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 was used : @xmath50 the factor before @xmath38 has been chosen to provide maximum separation between cosmic events and the events of the process ( [ mumu ] ) .",

    "most of the events of the process ( [ mumu ] ) are in the region @xmath54 . at each energy point",
    "the number of events of the process ( [ mumu ] ) was estimated by the following formula : @xmath55 here @xmath56 ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 were determined from the sample of the events with @xmath53  ns ; @xmath59 , @xmath60  from the sample of the events with @xmath61  ns .",

    "the passage of the particles through the detector was simulated by the program unimod2 @xcite .",

    "this dependence is determined mainly by the probability for a muon to reach the muon system .    the detection efficiency determined from the monte carlo",
    "was corrected in order to take into account the effects , which were not included into simulation .",
    "first is the efficiency of a software 3-rd level trigger , which selected the events during the data taking .",
    "this efficiency equals to 9798% for all runs , except the run phi_9601 , where it was 93% .",
    "second effect not included into the simulation is the inefficiency of the muon system .",
    "it was determined from the experimental data for each energy point and was also used as a correction for overall efficiency .",
    "this correction is about @xmath63 and was determined mainly by the dead time of the time channels .",
    "the energy dependence of the detection cross section was fitted with the following formula : @xmath64 where @xmath65 ; @xmath66 and @xmath67  the detection efficiencies of the processes ( [ mumu ] ) and ( [ pipi ] ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69  the cross sections of these processes .",
    "the energy dependence of the efficiency obtained from the simulation was approximated by a smooth function .    to perform a combined fit of the detection cross sections for all experimental runs the scale factors @xmath70 for each run",
    "were introduced into the detection efficiencies as free fit parameters .",
    "they are asymptotic detection efficiencies at energies higher than 520 mev , because the probability for a muon with such energy to hit the muon system is almost constant .",
    "this method provides an evaluation of efficiencies independent from simulation .",
    "the cross section @xmath69 was calculated according to formulae from the work @xcite and taking into account the experimental data on the pion form factor @xcite and the decay @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the cross section @xmath72 was taken in the following form : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the born cross section of the process @xmath77 ; @xmath78  mass and width of @xmath3 meson ; @xmath79  module and phase of the interference amplitude ; @xmath80  factor taking into account the radiative corrections .",
    "this factor was obtained as a ratio of the cross section of process ( [ mumu ] ) to the born cross section for the same acceptance angles and with the @xmath3-meson contribution .",
    "the cross section of the process ( [ mumu ] ) was calculated by the monte carlo method using the formulae from the work @xcite with appropriate cuts on the angles and momenta of the final muons .",
    "the luminosity measurement was performed taking into account the interference term in the cross section of the process ( [ ee ] ) .",
    "the interference amplitude is about @xmath81 and the phase differs by 180 degrees from the phase in the process ( [ mumu ] ) .",
    "the fit of the experimental data gives the interference phase @xmath82 , which is consistent with the theoretical expectation of @xmath83 .",

    "run the muon system worked in different regime .",
    "it was not fully compensated by the corrections .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of the software trigger in this run was lower .",
    "the explanation of the lower efficiency in the run phi_9606 is a lower gain in the drift chambers and consequently a worse resolution in @xmath86 .",
    "the error in the detection efficiency does not directly contribute into the error at interference amplitude if each run is recorded in the same conditions because the interference amplitude is a relative value .",
    "therefore the data with low gain in the drift chambers were excluded from the runs .",

    "the @xmath87 value obtained in the fit equals to @xmath88 for 45 degrees of freedom .",
    "the systematic error of the amplitude of the interference is determined by the errors of the luminosity estimation and the calculation of the radiative corrections .",
    "the measurement of the luminosity using the events of the process @xmath22 gives the estimation of the systematic error @xmath89 .",
    "additional systematic error can be due to imprecise evaluation of the background from the process ( [ pipi ] ) .",
