    "the metallicity distribution of the central stars of planetary systems compared with other stars of the same spectral types clearly show a metallicity excess of a factor two on the average , while the individual [ fe / h ] values lie between -0.3 and + 0.4 ( santos et al 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "although this excess is generally discussed in terms of iron abundances only ( for most observers [ fe / h ] is a synonymous of  metallicity \" ) , spectroscopic observations show that the abundances of other heavy elements beginning with carbon are also enhanced ( santos et al 2001 )    the proposed possible explanations for this behavior are of two kinds :    \\1 ) accretion hypothesis : this assumes that the star had normal abundances at its formation , but that it accreted metal - rich matter during the phases of planetary formation ( gonzalez 1998 )    \\2 ) primordial hypothesis : this assumes that the stellar gas out of which the planetary system formed was already metal - enhanced .",
    "a corollary in this case would be that such a metal enrichment is necessary for planets to form around stars    other explanations have been proposed which mix the two previous scenarios .    the strongest argument invoked against the accretion hypothesis",
    "is related to the mass of the outer convective zone which varies by more than one order of magnitude for stars between 1.0 and 1.4 m@xmath1 , while the metallicity excess is the same . on the other hand",
    "the primordial hypothesis has to deal with the fact that some of the host stars have a sub - solar metallicity , which is an argument against the assumption that metallicity excess is needed for planetary formation .    diffusion of accreted metals has been discussed by several authors ( pinsonneault et al 2001 , murray and chaboyer 2002 ) .",
    "they show that gravitational settling is not rapid enough to produce a decrease of the metal abundances and lead to the observed values .",
    "they also discuss rotational and other mixing processes in relation with the observed lithium abundances . as lithium",
    "is detroyed by thermonuclear reactions at a relatively small temperature ( @xmath2k ) inside stars , it is often used as a test for mixing processes .",
    "however such a comparison between the metal diffusion and the lithium depletion is highly model dependent as it assumes a specific variation of the mixing effect with depth .",
    "here we show that the argument against accretion does not hold as soon as we take into account the convective instability induced by inverse @xmath0-gradients , or thermohaline convection ( also called  double - diffusive convection \" ) .",
    "if freshly accreted metals accumulate in a small convective zone on top of radiative layers , they will not stay there but will be diluted downwards in  metallic fingers \" similar to the  salt fingers \" observed in the ocean , so that their overabundance will rapidly decrease with time .",
    "we discuss how this process should take place , with the conclusion that the final metallic abundances should not depend on the depth of the standard convective zone as usually assumed .",
    "however the exact amount of metals which may remain in the stellar outer layers depends on parameters like the size and depth of the metallic fingers , which can not be precisely constrained in the framework of our present knowledge .",
    "we only show that a final overabundance by a factor two as observed can be obtained with plausible values of the unknown parameters .",
    "two ways can be explored to go further in this study : numerical simulations of metallic fingers and asteroseismology of overmetallic stars .",
    "thermohaline convection is a wellknown process in oceanography : warm salted layers on the top of cool unsalted ones rapidly diffuse downwards even in the presence of stabilizing temperature gradients . when a blob is displaced downwards , it wants to go further down due to its overweight compared to the surroundings , but at the same time the fact that it is hotter contradicts this tendancy .",
    "when the salt gradient is large compared to the thermal gradient , salted water normally mixes down until the two effects compensate . then thermohaline convection begins . while the medium is marginally stable , salted blobs fall down like fingers while unsalted matter goes up around .",
    "this process is commonly known as  salt fingers \" ( stern 1960 , kato 1966 , veronis 1965 , turner 1973 , turner and veronis 2000 , gargett and ruddick 2003 ) .",
    "the reason why the medium is still unstable is due to the different diffusivities of heat and salt .",
    "a warm salted blob falling down in cool fresh water sees its temperature decrease before the salt has time to diffuse out : the blob goes on falling due to its weight until it mixes with the surroundings .    the salt finger instability can occur with any two components which have different diffusivities if there is an unstable gradient of the slower diffusive component and a stable gradient of the faster diffusive component . for this reason it is also referred to as",
    " double diffusive convection \" . in oceanography ,",
    "the fastest diffusive component is conventionally referred to a @xmath3 while the slowest one is @xmath4 even when the components are different .",
    "indeed the effect is generally studied in the laboratory using water with a mixture of salt and sugar . in this case sugar",
    "is the slowest component as it diffuses about three times slower than salt .",
    "the results can well be visualized , pictured and studied ( e.g. wells 2001 ) .",
    "the fingers have also been studied by 2d and 3d numerical simulation ( e.g. piacsek and toomre 1980 , shen and veronis 1997 , yoshida and nagashima 2003 )    the condition for the salt fingers to develop is related to the density variations induced by temperature and salinity perturbations .",
    "two important characteristic numbers are defined :    @xmath5 the density anomaly ratio @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the average temperature and salinity gradients in the considered zone    @xmath5 the so - called  lewis number \" @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the saline and thermal diffusivities while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the saline and thermal diffusion time scales .",
    "the density gradient is unstable and overturns into dynamical convection for @xmath16 while the salt fingers grow for @xmath17 . on the other hand they can not form",
    "if @xmath18 is larger than the ratio of the thermal to saline diffusivities @xmath19 as in this case the salinity difference between the blobs and the surroundings is not large enough to overcome buoyancy ( huppert and manins 1973 , gough and toomre 1982 , kunze 2003 ) .",
    "salt fingers can grow if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath20 in the ocean , @xmath21 is typically 0.01 while it is 1/3 for a salt - sugar mixture .",
    "we will see below that in solar - type stars where @xmath3 is the temperature while @xmath4 is the mean molecular weight this ratio is about @xmath22 if @xmath12 is the molecular ( or  microscopic \" ) diffusion coefficient but it can go up by many orders of magnitude when the shear flow instabilities which induce mixing between the edges of the fingers and the surroundings are taken into account .      thermohaline convection may occur in stellar radiative zones when a layer with a larger mean molecular weight sits on top of layers with smaller ones ( kato 1966 , spiegel 1969 , ulrich 1972 , kippenhahn et al 1980 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath23 = dln@xmath24/dln@xmath25 plays the role of the salinity gradient while the difference @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the usual adiabatic and local ( radiative ) gradients dln@xmath3/dln@xmath25 ) plays the role of the temperature gradient .",
    "when @xmath27 is smaller than @xmath29 , the temperature gradient is unstable against convection ( schwarszchild criterion ) which corresponds to warm water below cool water in oceanography . in the opposite case",
    "the temperature gradient is stable but the medium can become convectively unstable if ( ledoux criterion ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 ln @xmath32 ln @xmath33 and @xmath34 ln @xmath32 ln @xmath35 when this situation occurs , convection first takes place on a dynamical time scale and the @xmath24 enriched matter mixes down with the surroundings until @xmath36 vanishes . then marginal stability is achieved and thermohaline convection may begin as a  secular process \" , namely on a thermal time scale ( short compared to the stellar lifetime ! ) .",
    "such an effect has previously been studied for stars with a helium - rich accreted layer ( kippenhahn et al 1980 ) .",
    "it was also invoked for helium - rich stars in which helium is supposed to accumulate due to diffusion in a stellar wind ( as proposed by vauclair 1975 ) and for roap stars in case some helium accumulation occurs ( vauclair et al 1991 ) .",
    "similar computations have been done in the case of accretion of matter on white dwarfs , in relation with novae explosions ( e.g. marks and sarna 1998 ) .",
    "as we will show below , if hydrogen poor matter is accreted on the top of a main - sequence type star with normal abundances , it creates an inverse @xmath0-gradient which may lead to thermohaline convection . comparing the stellar case with the water case",
    ", we can guess that metallic fingers will form if the following condition is verified : @xmath37 with @xmath38 = @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the thermal and molecular diffusion coefficients while @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the corresponding time scales .",
    "this condition is similar to condition ( 3 ) for the stellar case . in the following",
    ", we will neglect the deviations from perfect gas law , so that @xmath44 .    in the next section",
    "we show computations of the time scales and orders of magnitude of this process .",
    "we study the case of main - sequence solar type stars which would have accreted hydrogen - poor material at the beginning of their lifetime .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that the accretion occurred in a very short time scale compared to stellar evolution .",
    "we then study the fate of the accreted metals and chose the examples of 1.1 m@xmath1 and 1.3 m@xmath1 stars .",
    "as the chemical composition of the accreted matter is not known , we assume that all elements are accreted with solar relative abundances except hydrogen and helium which are assumed completely absent .",
    "we will see that our general conclusion would not be changed if the relative abundances were modified : the time scales would only be slightly different .",
    "after accretion , the metal dilution occurs in two phases .",
    "phase one : rapid convection takes place in a dynamical time scale until it reaches the marginal equilibrium obtained when @xmath36 vanishes ( equation 4 ) .",
    "phase two : thermohaline mixing begins and dilutes the metal excess until condition ( 5 ) is no longer satisfied .    in the following ,",
    "we first discuss the @xmath45-gradients induced by the original metal excess in the convective zone .",
    "we compute the situation at the end of phase one , according to the value of the accreted mass .",
    "we discuss the case of the same accretion occurring for the two different stellar masses .",
    "finally we study the time scales of thermohaline mixing and the remaining overabundances in the convective zone .",
    "the main parameters of the two stellar models we have used as an example are given in table 1 .",
    "they correspond to 1.1 m@xmath1 and 1.3 m@xmath1 , both at an age of about 1.5 gyr .",
    "we can see that the convective zone is 7 times more massive for the 1.1 m@xmath1 model than for the 1.3 m@xmath1 model , which does not change sensitively during main sequence evolution .",
    "we thus expect that metal accretion leads to an original overabundance 7 times larger in the 1.3 m@xmath1 model than in the 1.1 m@xmath1 model .    for completely ionised",
    "hydrogen and helium , the mean molecular weight may be obtained with the following expression : @xmath46 here a represents an average mass of metals , @xmath47 a relative abundance with respect to hydrogen , and @xmath48 an averaged number of particules ( ion and electrons ) associated with the metals . in the following",
    "we take @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the original abundances of helium and metals ( grevesse and sauval 1998 ) .",
    "we treat the metals as an average element to which we attribute the mass @xmath51 .",
    "we assume hydrogen and helium completely ionized and we neglect the term @xmath52 .",
    "in these conditions we obtain @xmath53 for the value of the mean molecular weight before accretion .",
    "if metals are added , @xmath24 is modified by : @xmath54    let us now write : @xmath55 and define @xmath56 as the initial value of @xmath57 , obtained just after the accretion process ( assumed rapid compared to the other time scales ) .",
    "the variations of @xmath47 and @xmath58 are then related by : @xmath59    we have computed , as a function of the initial overabundance ratio @xmath56 , the depth at which metal - enriched material has been diluted when it reaches the marginal equilibrium phase , and the actual overabundance ratio @xmath57 in the convective zone .",
    "this has been obtained by integrating in all cases the mass of metals diluted by this process .",
    "suppose , for example , that the metal excess ratio in a 1.1 m@xmath1 star is @xmath60 after dilution by dynamical convection .",
    "this corresponds to an original overabundance factor of 2.05 .",
    "the same accretion mass would lead to an original metal excess ratio @xmath61 in a 1.3 m@xmath1 star .",
    "our computations show that such an original metal excess is diluted in a  transition zone \" down to @xmath62 cm , leading to an overabundance after dilution @xmath63 .",
    "figure 1 displays the abundance profiles obtained in this case in the 1.3 m@xmath1 star .",
    "the parameters at the bottom of the transition zones as we have defined above are shown in table 1 for the two models .",
    "figure 2 and 3 display , for the two models , the values of @xmath56 and the corresponding @xmath57 as a function of the width of the transition zone .",
    "thermohaline mixing begins after this dilution process .",
    "lrrrrcrrrrr    @xmath64 ( cz ) & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & & + @xmath64 ( tz ) & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 + @xmath79 ( cz ) & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 & @xmath85 & & + @xmath79 ( tz ) & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath89 & @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 +      the study of thermohaline mixing in stars is far from trivial .",
    "detailed comparisons of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments in the water case have recently been published ( gargett and ruddick 2003 ) but the stellar case may be different as mixing then occurs in a compressible stratified fluid .    in the following we use the formalism proposed by kippenhahn et al 1980 ( hereafter krt ) who discussed the time scale of thermohaline mixing in stars in a simplified way and applied it to the case of helium rich layers standing on the top of hydrogen rich ones .    in first approximation they treated thermohaline mixing as a diffusion theory .",
    "the whole picture may be described as follows : blobs of metal enriched matter begin to fall down from the convective zone and exchange heat and heavy elements with their surroundings ; chemicals diffuse more slowly than heat , so that the blobs go on falling down until they are completely disrupted , thereby creating finger shapes .",
    "the most efficient process for element diffusion out of the blobs is the shear flow instabilities at the edge of the fingers : as the falling down matter undergoes friction with matter going up , turbulence occurs and mixes part of the fingers with their surroundings , on a horizontal length scale which is a fraction @xmath94 of the horizontal size @xmath95 of the blobs .",
    "the blobs disappear when they have travelled down on a distance @xmath96 long enough for this mixing to disrupt them completely .",
    "krt define a diffusion coefficient @xmath97 as the product of the blobs vertical velocity @xmath98 by their size @xmath95 .",
    "they evaluate @xmath98 as : @xmath99 where @xmath100 represents the @xmath24 difference between the inside and the outside of the blobs .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath97 is then obtained as : @xmath101 the local thermal time scale given by : @xmath102 where the parameters have their usual meanings .",
    "we can see that @xmath103 vanishes in this diffusion coefficient which does not depend on the size of the blobs .    in this simple picture ,",
    "@xmath97 is not exactly the local mixing coefficient as it involves the whole blobs while local mixing involves only the edges of the blobs .",
    "the local mixing coefficient becomes correctly represented by @xmath97 only at the bottom of the fingers , where the blobs disappear .",
    "for this reason , krt define the thermohaline diffusion time scale as : @xmath104 where @xmath96 is the depth of the fingers ( it also represents the size of the transition zone in which @xmath24 varies by @xmath105 , between its two extreme values ) .",
    "this diffusion time scale may be written : @xmath106 note that if the mixing scale at the finger edges increases linearly while the blobs fall down , the coefficient @xmath94 is nothing else than the ratio of the horizontal and vertical length scales of the fingers , namely @xmath107 .",
    "we give in table 1 the thermohaline diffusion time scales corresponding to the example given in the previous section , with a metallic excess of a factor 2 in 1.1 m@xmath1 .",
    "computations done with a metal excess of 1.5 instead of 2 give similar results for the thermohaline diffusion time scales .",
    "they are always very short compared to the stellar lifetime .",
    "if nothing could stop these metallic fingers from growing , the convective zone would be emptied of its metallic matter short after it is accreted .",
    "we must now take into account the second condition for the formation of the fingers ( equation 5 ) , namely : @xmath108 at the end of the dynamical convection phase , the @xmath109 ratio is one .",
    "then , during thermohaline convection , the local @xmath24-gradient decreases so that the @xmath109 ratio increases .",
    "thermohaline convection should stop when this ratio reaches the value of the @xmath110 ratio .",
    "the remaining overabundances in the stellar outer layers strongly depend on the efficiency of the turbulent mixing at the edge of the fingers , which is non linear and not really known .",
    "we can only give here a tentative discussion of this process .",
    "the thermal diffusion coefficient @xmath40 may be evaluated as the square of a relevant length scale ( e.g. the size of the falling blobs ) divided by the local thermal time scale @xmath111 : @xmath112    below the convective zone in the 1.1 m@xmath113 , @xmath40 is typically of @xmath114@xmath115s@xmath116 while it is @xmath117@xmath115s@xmath116 in the 1.3 m@xmath113 model .",
    "meanwhile the microscopic element diffusion coefficient is of order one @xmath115s@xmath116 : if no turbulence occured , the metallic fingers would extend far down and deplete the overmetallic material until an extremely small @xmath24-gradient would be reached : in this case no metallic excess would be left in the convective zone .",
    "if we take into account the shear flow instabilities which result from the motion of the blobs , @xmath41 has to be replaced by the local turbulent diffusion coefficient which is not exactly @xmath97 but @xmath118 where @xmath119 represents the @xmath107 ratio . using equation ( 11 ) for @xmath97",
    ", we find from condition ( 14 ) that the fingers disappear when @xmath96 is of the same order as @xmath95 , which makes sense but is not helpful to evaluate the amount of heavy elements which remains in the outer layers at the end of the whole process : the krt approximations are too rough to be useful in this respect .",
    "another approach consists in estimating the value of @xmath41 which would be needed to account for the observations .",
    "our aim is that a metallicity excess of order two remains in the convective zone after these processes occurred . from equation ( 9 )",
    "we find that it corresponds to @xmath120 or , with @xmath121 as computed in these stellar layers , @xmath122 . if we suppose that the mixing region extends over one pressure scale height ( which is by not means proved ! ) we find that the @xmath123 ratio should be of order 10 , which seems reasonable compared to the water case .",
    "such a value would be obtained with a turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath41 at the edge of the fingers of order @xmath124 to @xmath125 @xmath126.s@xmath116 .",
    "more computations are needed for a better understanding of the shear flow turbulence induced by the fingers .",
    "furthermore the growing of the metallic fingers may depend on the other processes at work in the star : rotation - induced turbulence , internal waves , etc .",
    "similar problems in salted water : gargett and ruddick 2003 ) .    in any case",
    "the computations presented here show that the metallic matter accreted onto a star does not stay inside the standard convective zone : it first turns over due to dynamical convection and then goes on diffusing due thermohaline convection .",
    "the observed overabundances in planetary systems host stars can be obtained with realistic values of the unknown parameters .",
    "the important conclusion of this paper is that the strongest argument against accretion as an explanation of the metallic excess observed in host stars planetary systems host stars has to be revised : if hydrogen poor matter is accreted in the early phases of stellar evolution , during planet formation , the metal excess in the convective zone leads to a destabilizing @xmath0-gradient which induces metal dilution , first by dynamical convection , then by thermohaline mixing , on a time scale much shorter than the stellar lifetime ( typically 1000 yrs ) .",
    "the remaining overabundances in the convective zones depend on the physical conditions inside the star .",
    "we do not expect , in case of accretion , to end up with metallic overabundances increasing with decreasing convective mass as obtained in standard models .",
    "furthermore , the region mixed by the thermohaline process is localised below the convective zones and should not go down to the lithium destruction layers .    in the present study , we have supposed that the accreted material had a relative solar abundance , except for hydrogen and helium which were assumed completely absent . changing these relative abundances would modify the relation between the @xmath24 value and the metallicity ( equation 9 ) .",
    "the general conclusions would still hold : the numerical values and time scales would only be changed accordingly .    we did not discuss the amount of matter needed to explain the observed abundances by accretion and how this accretion could have proceed . in the example of section 3.1 , a metal excess of 2.05 in 1.1 m@xmath113 star would be obtained with 145 m@xmath127 of all metals included , corresponding to about 11 m@xmath127 of iron , which is a large value .",
    "a metal excess of 1.5 would be obtained with 5 m@xmath127 of iron or 66 m@xmath127 of all metals .",
    "the difficulty of explaining such a large accretion from protoplanetary discs represents a second argument against the accretion hypothesis , which we do not discuss here : this is a different subject , out of the scope of the present paper .    detailed spectroscopic observations and precise abundance determinations will be of great interest to test the accretion processes against the primordial scenario for exoplanets hosts stars .",
    "asteroseismic studies of these stars will also help deriving whether they are overmetallic down to the center or only in their outer layers and give an important hint for a better understanding of the formation of planetary systems .",
