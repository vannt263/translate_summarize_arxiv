    "the response of living systems to an external stimulus is coordinated by highly specialized signal transduction machinery . in the bacterial kingdom , this is achieved by the well characterized two - component system ( tcs ) minimally comprised of the membrane bound sensor kinase ( sk ) and the cytoplasmic response regulator ( rr ) @xcite .",
    "the machinery of tcs is utilized by the bacteria to process the information of external signal in terms of phosphotransfer kinetics .",
    "when applied , an external stimulus causes phosphorylation at the histidine residue of sk which then gets transferred to the cognate ( and/or non - cognate ) rr at its aspartate domain .",
    "the phosphorylated rr then acts as a transcription factor for several downstream genes , as well as for the activation / represion of its own operon .",
    "it is now a well established fact that in addition to being a source ( kinase ) , some sk can also act as a sink ( phosphatase ) while interacting with an rr @xcite",
    ". such bifunctional behavior of sk towards rr can altogether build a robust motif in the bacterial signal transduction network @xcite .",
    "the expression of proteins in individual cells is usually driven by the fluctuations present within the cellular environment as well as the fluctuations imposed by the external stimulus @xcite .",
    "this often leads to variability in the expression level within the context of a single cell @xcite .",
    "when observed in the bulk , such fluctuations get averaged out over the cellular population .",

    "correlation between extrinsic and intrinsic noise due to external signal and internal biochemical pathways , respectively , has also been reported to enhance the robustness of zero - order ultrasensitivity @xcite .",
    "post - translational modification in terms of phosphate transfer is important to generate the pool of phosphorylated rr that acts as a transcription factor for several downstream genes .",
    "bifunctionality , on the other hand , plays a crucial role to maintain this pool as the information flows through the phosphotransfer motif .",
    "thus bifunctionality and post - translational modification work hand in hand to maintain the optimal pool of phosphorylated rr .",
    "since this composite functional behavior takes place in a noisy cellular environment , it is worthwhile to investigate the role of cellular noise on the bifunctionality controlled post - translational modification of the components of the well composed tcs signal transduction machinery .",
