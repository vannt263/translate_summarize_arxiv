    "we thus obtain a rooted forest with @xmath200 components , @xmath207 edges , and hence @xmath10 vertices .",
    "the @xmath200 roots are labeled by their corresponding intervals , while the remaining @xmath207 vertices are labeled by distinct positive integers derived from the original edge labels .    as an example , consider the diagram below left , which shows a pruned face of perimeter @xmath208 with @xmath209 edges added to create a face of perimeter @xmath210 .",
    "the corresponding rooted forest is shown below right .",
