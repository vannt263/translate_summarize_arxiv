    "the ability of light to influence the kinetic motion of microscopic and atomic matter has had a profound impact in the last three decades .",
    "the optical manipulation of matter was first seriously studied by ashkin and co - workers in the 1970s @xcite , and led ultimately to the demonstration of the single beam gradient force trap @xcite , referred to as optical tweezers , where the gradient of an optical field can induce dielectric particles of higher refractive index than their surrounding medium to be trapped in three dimensions in the light field maxima @xcite .",
    "much of ashkin s early work centered not on gradient forces , but on the use of radiation pressure to trap particles @xcite , and a dual beam radiation pressure trap was demonstrated in a which single particle was confined .",
    "this work ultimately contributed to the development of the magneto - optical trap for neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "recently we observed one - dimensional _ arrays _ of silica spheres trapped in a dual beam radiation pressure trap @xcite .",
    "these arrays had an unusual property in that the particles that formed the array were regularly spaced from each other .",
    "the particles were redistributing the incident light field , which in turn redistributed the particle spacings , allowing them to reside in equilibrium positions .",
    "this effect , known as optically bound matter \" was first realised in a slightly different context via a different mechanism to ours some years ago @xcite using a single laser beam and was explained as the interaction of the coherently induced dipole moments of microscopic spheres in an optical field creating bound matter .    in the context of our study",
    "optically bound matter is of interest as it relates to the way in which particles interact with the light field in extended optical lattices , which may prove useful for the understanding of three - dimensional trapping of colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "indeed optically bound matter may provide an attractive method for the creation of such lattices that are not possible using interference patterns .",
    "bound matter may also serve as a test bed for studies of atomic or ionic analogues to our microscopic system @xcite .",
    "subsequent to our report a similar observation was made in an experiment making use of a dual beam fiber trap @xcite . in this latter paper",
    "a theory was developed that examined particles of approximately the same size as the laser wavelength involved . in this paper",
    "we develop a numerical model that allows us to simulate the equilibrium positions of two and three particles in a counter - propagating beam geometry , where the particle sizes are larger than the laser wavelength , and fall outside the upper bound of the limits discussed in @xcite .",
    "the model can readily be extended to look at larger arrays of systems .",
    "we discuss the role of the scattering and refraction of light in the creation of arrays . in the next section",
    "we describe the numerical model we use for our studies and derive predictions for the separation of two and three spheres of various sizes .",
    "we then compare this with both previous and current experiments .",
    "= 1000    our model comprises two monochromatic laser fields of frequency @xmath0 counter - propagating along the z - axis which interact with a system of @xmath1 transparent dielectric spheres of mass @xmath2 , refractive - index @xmath3 , and radius @xmath4 , with centers at positions @xmath5 , and which are immersed in a host medium of refractive - index @xmath6 . the electric field is written @xmath7 , \\label{efield}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the unit polarization vector of the field , @xmath9 are the slowly varying electric field amplitudes of the right or forward propagating @xmath10 and left or backward propagating @xmath11 fields , and @xmath12 is the wavevector of the field in the host medium .",
    "the incident fields are assumed to be collimated gaussians at longitudinal coordinates @xmath13 for the forward field and @xmath14 for the backward field @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the initial gaussian spot size , and @xmath18 is the input power in each beam .",
    "it is assumed that all the spheres are contained between the beam waists within the length @xmath19 .",
    "consider first that the dielectric spheres are in a fixed configuration at time @xmath20 specified by the centers @xmath21 .",
    "then the dielectric spheres provide a spatially inhomogeneous refractive index distribution which can be written in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the heaviside step function which is unity within the sphere of radius @xmath4 centered on @xmath24 , and zero outside , and @xmath3 is the refractive - index of the spheres .",
    "then , following standard approaches @xcite , the counter - propagating fields evolve according to the paraxial wave equations @xmath25 along with the boundary conditions in eq .",
    "( [ bcond ] ) , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the transverse laplacian describing beam diffraction .",
    "thus , a given configuration of the dielectric spheres modifies the fields @xmath9 in a way that can be calculated from the above field equations .",
    "we remark that even though the spheres move , and hence so does the refractive - index distribution , the fields will always adiabatically slave to the instantaneous sphere configuration .",
    "to proceed we need equations of motion for how the sphere centers @xmath21 move in reaction to the fields . the time - averaged dipole interaction energy @xcite , relative to that for a homogeneous dielectric medium of refractive - index @xmath6 , between the counter - propagating fields and the system of spheres",
    "is given by @xmath28<\\vec{e}^2 > \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{4}(n_s^2-n_h^2)\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\int _ { } ^ { } dv\\theta(r-|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}_j(t)|)\\left[|{\\cal e}_+(\\vec{r})|^2+|{\\cal e}_-(\\vec{r})|^2 \\right ] , \\label{u}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angled brackets signify a time - average which kills fast - varying components at @xmath29 .",
    "the most important concept is that the dipole interaction potential depends on the spatial configuration of the spheres @xmath30 since the counter - propagating fields themselves depends on the sphere distribution via the paraxial wave equations ( [ parax ] ) .",
    "this form of the dipole interaction potential ( [ u ] ) shows explicitly that we pick up a contribution from each sphere labelled @xmath31 via its interaction with the local intensity . assuming over - damped motion of the spheres in the host medium with viscous damping coefficient @xmath32 , the equation of motion for the sphere centers become @xmath33 where @xmath34 signifies a gradient with respect to @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the gradient and the scattering forces experienced by the j@xmath37 sphere , the latter of which we shall give an expression for below .",
    "carrying through simulations for a 3d system with modelling of the electromagnetic propagation in the presence of many spheres poses a formidable challenge , so here we take advantage of the symmetry of the system to reduce the calculation involved .",
    "first , for the cylindrically symmetric gaussian input beams used here we assume that the combination of the dipole interaction potential , and associated gradient force , and the scattering force supplies a strong enough transverse confining potential that the sphere motion remains directed along the z - axis .",
    "this means that the positions of the sphere centers are located along the z - axis @xmath38 , and that the gradient and scattering forces are also directed along the z - axis @xmath39 .",
    "second , we assume that the sphere distribution along the z - axis is symmetric around @xmath40 , the beam foci being at @xmath41 .",
    "this means , for example , that for one sphere the center is located at @xmath40 , for two spheres the centers are located at @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the sphere separation distance , and for three spheres the centers are at @xmath44 . for three or less spheres the symmetric configuration of spheres is captured by the sphere spacing @xmath43 , and we shall consider this case here . for more than three spheres",
    "the situation becomes more complicated and we confine our discussion to the simplest cases of two and three spheres .    with the above approximations in mind the equations of motion for the sphere centers become @xmath45 at this point it is advantageous to consider the case of two spheres , @xmath46 , to illustrate how calculations are performed .",
    "for a given distance @xmath43 between the spheres we calculate the counter - propagating fields between @xmath47 $ ] using the beam propagation method . from the fields we can numerically calculate the dipole interaction energy @xmath48 for a given sphere separation , and the resulting axial ( z - directed ) gradient force",
    "is then @xmath49 .",
    "thus , by calculating the counter - propagating fields for a variety of sphere separations we can numerically calculate the gradient force which acts on the relative coordinate of the two spheres . for our system",
    "we approximate the scattering force @xcite along the positive z - axis for the j@xmath37 sphere as @xmath50 , \\ ] ] with @xmath51 the scattering cross - section .",
    "this formula is motivated by the generic relation @xmath52 for unidirectional propagation , with the scattered power @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the incident intensity .",
    "the integral yields the difference in power between the two counter - propagating beams integrated over the sphere cross - section , and when this is divided by the sphere cross - sectional area @xmath55 we get the averaged intensity difference over the spheres . for the case of two spheres",
    "we calculate the scattering force @xmath56 , evaluated at the position of the sphere at @xmath57 , and for a variety of sphere spacings @xmath43 .",
    "a similar procedure can readily be applied to the case of three spheres .",
    "the theory described above has some limitations that we now discuss .",
    "first , we assume that the spheres are trapped on - axis by a combination of the scattering and/or dipole forces acting transverse to the propagation axis . for this to be possible",
    "we require that the sphere diameter be less than the laser beam diameter @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed paraxial propagation that neglects any large angle or back - scattering of the laser fields .",
    "however , when light is incident on a sphere of diameter @xmath43 there is an associated wavevector uncertainty @xmath59 , and when @xmath60 back - scattering can occur , as it is within the uncertainty that an incident wave of wavevector @xmath61 along a given direction is converted into @xmath62 .",
    "this yields the condition @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the free - space wavelength , to avoid back - scattering and so that our paraxial assumptions are obeyed .",
    "our goal is to compare the axial gradient and scattering forces for an array of two and three spheres and compare with the experimental results .",
    "however , the scattering cross - section for our spheres , which incorporates all sources of scattering in a phenomenological manner , can not be calculated with any certainty . our approach , therefore , will be to calculate the equilibrium sphere separation @xmath65 for the gradient and scattering forces separately , which does not depend on the value of the cross - section , and compare the calculated sphere separations with the experimental values . by comparing the theoretical predictions with the experiment for @xmath66 we can determine the dominant source of the axial force acting on the spheres .",
    "to compare our theory with experiment we use data from our previous work @xcite and also recreate that experiment , but using a different laser wavelength and particle sphere size .",
    "the previously reported experiment @xcite makes use of a continuous - wave 780 nm ti : sapphire laser , which is split into two beams with approximately equal power ( 25mw ) in each arms .",
    "each of the beams is focussed down to a spot with a 3.5 @xmath67 beam waist and then passed , counterpropagating , through a cuvette with dimensions of 5 mm x 5 mm x 20 mm .",
    "the beam waists were separated by a finite amount , which is discussed further below .",
    "uniform silica spheres with a 3@xmath67 diameter ( bangs laboratories , inc ) in a water solution were placed in the cuvette , and the interaction of the beams with the sample caused one - dimensional arrays of particle to be formed .",
    "the refractive index of the spheres is approximately 1.43 .",
    "we also carried out a similar experiment using a 1064@xmath68 nd : yag laser where the beam waists were 4.3@xmath67 and we used 2.3@xmath67 diameter spheres .",
    "the particles were viewed by looking at the scattered light orthogonal to the laser beam propagation direction viewed on a ccd camera with an attached microscope objective ( x20 , na=0.4 , newport ) .    to compare our theory with experimental results we need to concentrate on a small number of parameters , the sphere size , the beam waist , the refractive index of the spheres and the beam waist separation .",
    "we know the particle sizes and can make a good estimate as to their refractive index , further we can measure the beam waist to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the only problematic factor is the beam waist separation . due to experimental constraints",
    ", this is quite difficult to measure .",
    "we estimate the waist separation by filling the cuvette with a high density particle solution and looking at the scattered light from the sample .",
    "the high density of particle allows us to map out the intensity pattern of the two beams and hence make an estimate as to the waist separation .",
    "this is , however , an inaccurate method and leaves us with an error of more than 100% .",
    "we therefore use our model to help us fix the beam waist separation on a single result and then examine the behavior of the model when varying other parameters .",
    "the error in the beam waist separation is not as extreme as first it sounds however . modelling the system for a range of beam waist separations from 80@xmath69 m to 200@xmath69 m results in a predicted range of sphere separations as shown in figure 1 , 2.3@xmath69 m diameter spheres .",
    "we see that although initially the beam waist separation difference makes a reasonable difference to the predicted sphere separation the region that we believe we are working in , @xmath70 m waist separation , is relatively flat",
    ". therefore even if we do have a large error in this value , the predicted result does not vary significantly .",
    "this increases our confidence that we have the correct beam waist separation with a higher uncertainty that our experimental measurements of this parameter suggests .",
    "we begin by examining the case of the 2.3 @xmath67 diameter spheres .",
    "the rate of change of sphere separation is seen to drop off as the waist separation increases .",
    "the fit to a parabola is to aid the eye , rather than to suggest a quantitative relationship.,width=302 ]      we consider the case for chains of both two and three spheres . for two spheres",
    "we measure a sphere separation of  34@xmath67 , for a beam waist , @xmath71 at a laser wavelength , @xmath72 . using a beam waist separation of @xmath73",
    "our model predicts an equilibrium in the scattering force of 34@xmath74 , as is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the intensity in the x - z plane for this configuration is shown in figure 3 .",
    "we see no such equilibrium in the gradient force , shown in figure 4 and conclude that the scattering force is the dominant factor in this instance . using the same parameters for the three sphere case give us a sphere separation prediction of  62@xmath67 , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "again this dominates over the gradient force , this assumption being valid , as the theory gives a good prediction of our experimental observations .",
    "our experimental result is 57@xmath67 , but we estimate our model value falls within the standard deviation error we observe on our experimental measurements .     diameter silica spheres with the beam waists 180 @xmath67 apart .",

    "the beam waists @xmath78 apart , we predict a sphere separation of  47@xmath67 ( figure 6 ) while our experiment predicts a distance of  45@xmath67 . using the same parameters for the three sphere case we predict a sphere separation of 27@xmath67 ( figure 7 ) , while our experiment shows a separation of  35@xmath67 . again , as we predict equilibrium positions with the scattering force component , but not with the gradient force component , we conclude that the scattering force is the dominant factor in determining the final sphere separations .     diameter silica spheres with the beam waists 150 @xmath67 apart .",

    "@xmath79 and @xmath77 .",
    "the plot shows the separation between two of the three spheres , and the scattering forces are symmetric about the center sphere.,width=302 ]",
    "our model accurately predicts separations for the case of two and three spheres , at certain sizes .",
    "however we also performed experiments using @xmath80 diameter spheres and could not find any agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "since our model uses a paraxial approximation , the assumption is that in these smaller size regimes the model breaks down .",
    "this in contrast to the work detailed in @xcite which works in size regimes closer to the laser wavelength , @xmath64 , and begins to break down in the larger size regimes ( @xmath81 ) , where @xmath82 is the sphere diameter .",
    "we also note that the beam separation distance becomes less critical as it becomes larger . for small beam waist separation distances ( @xmath83 ,",
    "say ) , any change in this parameter leads to a sharp change in the sphere separation distance , whereas at the waist separation distances we work at the change in sphere separation distance is far more gentle , and hence gives less rise to uncertainty over exact fits with theory and experiment .",
    "the other main parameter is sphere size , which has an appreciable effect on the predicted sphere separation .",
    "the incident power on the spheres does not make much of a difference and is more of a scaling factor in the forces involved rather than a direct modifier in the model . predicted sphere separation is also sensitive to the refractive index difference between the spheres and the surrounding medium , so it is important that the spheres refractive index is well known .",
    "it should also be possible to create two - dimensional and possibly three dimensional arrays from optically bound matter .",
    "the extension to two dimensions is relatively simple to envisage with the use of multiple pairs of counterpropagating laser beams . in three dimensions",
    "the formation of such optically bound arrays may circumvent some of the problems associated with loading of three - dimensional optical lattices @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that the creation of an optical lattice ( via multibeam interference , say ) will allow the simple , unambiguous trapping of particles in all the lattice sites , thereby making an extended three - dimensional array of particles .",
    "such arrays may be useful for crystal template formation @xcite and in studies of crystallization processes @xcite .",
    "however crystal formation in this manner is not particularly robust in that as the array is filled the particles perturb the propagating light field such that they prevent the trap sites below them being efficiently filled",
    ". arrays of optically bound matter do not suffer from such problems , as they are organized as a result of the perturbation of the propagating fields .",
    "further the fact that the particles are bound together provides more realistic opportunities for studying crystal and colloidal behaviour than that in unbound optically generated arrays , such as those produced holographically @xcite .",
    "we have developed a model by which the propagation of counter - propagating lasers beams moving past an array of silica spheres may be examined .",
    "analysis of the resulting forces on the spheres allows us to predict the separation of the spheres which constitute the array .",
    "we have compared this model with experimental results for different beam parameters ( wavelength , waist separation , waist diameter ) and found the results to be in good agreement with our observations .",
    "the model , does not however , work with sphere sizes much less than approximately twice the laser wavelength .",
    "our model is readily extendable to larger number of spheres , and will be of great use in the study of such one- and higher - dimensional arrays of optically bound matter .",
