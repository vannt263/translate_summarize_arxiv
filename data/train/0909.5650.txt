    "in this paper we shall show that imposition of the correct lorentz structure in the parton model allows us to relate two issues which , _ a priori _ , do not seem to be connected with each other : the derivation of a consistent expression for the polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure function @xmath0 in the parton model , and the derivation of the higher twist target - mass corrections i.e.  corrections of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the nucleon mass , to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    as will be discussed below",
    ", the target - mass corrections have previously been derived in a very complicated way from the operator product expansion ( ope ) , and the derivation of the wandzura - wilczek  ( ww ) expression for @xmath0 has involved a questionable analytic continuation in the ope moments  @xcite .",
    "it is thus particularly interesting that these results can be derived in a field theoretic context without use of the ope .",
    "target - mass corrections for _ unpolarized _ dis were first derived by nachtmann @xcite employing a very elegant mathematical approach in which the power series expansion used in the ope was replaced by an expansion into a series of hyperspherical functions ( representation functions of the homogeneous lorentz group ) .",
    "later , also within the context of the ope , georgi and politzer @xcite re - derived nachtmann s results using what they called an alternative analysis  for simple - minded souls like ourselves \" i.e.  based on a straightforward power series expansion but , in fact , requiring a very clever handling of the combinatoric aspects of the problem .",
    "the derivation of target - mass corrections for _ polarized _ dis turned out to be much more difficult .",
    "several papers @xcite succeeded in expressing the reduced matrix elements @xmath6 , @xmath7 of the relevant operators in terms of combinations of moments of the structure functions , but did not manage to derive closed expressions for the structure functions @xmath8 themselves .",
    "the latter was finally achieved in 1997 by piccione and ridolfi @xcite and later generalized to weak interaction , charged current reactions , by blmlein and tkabladze @xcite .",
    "these calculations , based on the ope , are extremely complicated , and we shall see presently how the same results can be obtained in a much simpler field - theoretic approach .",
    "the clue to this entire approach is contained in the classic paper of ellis , furmanski and petronzio ( efp ) @xcite , which gave the first derivation of the dynamic higher twist corrections to unpolarized dis in terms of amplitudes involving not just the  handbag \" diagram of fig .",
    "[ hand ] , whose soft part is the quark - quark @xmath9 correlator @xmath10 , but the higher order diagrams in fig .  [ qqg ] , whose soft parts are the @xmath11 and @xmath12 correlators respectively .",
    "the dis  handbag \" diagram involving the @xmath13-correlator.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    dis diagrams involving the @xmath11 and @xmath12-correlators.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    efp begin with a brief discussion of a parton model , which they refer to as a  reference model \" , in which the active quark , momentum @xmath14 , emitted from the nucleon is on mass - shell . handling the kinematics",
    "exactly they arrive at expressions for the unpolarized structure functions @xmath15 in terms of the quark densities @xmath16 which are identical to those of nachtmann @xcite .    at first sight",
    "it seems surprising that such a naive model should give the exact results of the theory .",
    "but the point is  and this is something not stressed in the literature  that any off - shellness of the quark is a direct consequence of qcd , i.e.  if the strong interaction coupling @xmath17 then it follows that ( taking the quark mass @xmath18 ) @xmath19 [ see eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) ] .",
    "target - mass corrections are , by definition , kinematic in origin , therefore are independent of the value of @xmath20 .",
    "hence it is not miraculous that a model with @xmath19 , i.e.  equivalent to putting @xmath17 , should yield exact results for the target - mass corrections .",
    "however , it is crucial that the lorentz structure is built into the model , as is done by efp @xcite .",
    "the implications of this are that the exact target - mass corrections must be derivable from the  handbag \" diagram , fig .",
    "[ hand ] , alone , since the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ qqg ] vanish when @xmath17 .",
    "we shall carry out the derivation for polarized dis and also show that when the lorentz structure is respected the @xmath19  model \" yields an unambiguous result for @xmath0 , namely the wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) result @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the well - known bjorken variable for dis .",
    "this suggests that the analytic continuation necessary in the ope derivation of the ww result is in fact correct , and also implies that in a correctly formulated parton model , with on - shell quarks , @xmath0 is exactly given by the ww expression .",
    "in this paper we shall also show that careful attention to the lorentz structure in the parton model imposes strong constraints on the possible @xmath1 dependence of the so - called transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton densities , that in recent years have received much emphasis ( for an up - to - date review see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . indeed , taking into account",
    "the transverse momentum of partons is important for an understanding of the large transverse single spin asymmetries observed in many reactions .",
    "it is also essential in order to generate the parton orbital angular momentum which appears necessary as a consequence of the small contribution to the nucleon angular momentum provided by the parton spins .",
    "as we are going to show , imposing lorentz covariance we are able to _ derive _ , for the unpolarized densities @xmath23 , the longitudinal densities @xmath24 and the transversity densities @xmath25 or @xmath26 , their dependence on @xmath1 from the functional form of the usual collinear , @xmath1-integrated , parton densities @xmath27 , @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 [ these relations are spelled out in detail in eqs .",
    "( [ vaa ] ) ,  ( [ wa2 ] ) and ( [ wa ] ) , and in eqs .",
    "( [ gb ] ) ,  ( [ q2 ] ) ] .",
    "moreover , if perturbative evolution with @xmath30 is taken into account , then the evolution of the @xmath1-dependent densities is entirely controlled via the known evolution of the collinear densities .",
    "it should be noted that the functional form found in the parton model is quite different from the often used factorized form , typically @xmath31 , though the latter may be a reasonable starting point for analyzing the presently available data .",
    "further , we obtain positivity and soffer - type bounds  @xcite , based on the @xmath1-dependent densities , which are stronger , in general , than those usually imposed on the purely @xmath32-dependent , @xmath1-integrated , collinear densities , and we suggest that it would be interesting to impose these bounds on the collinear densities when extracting parton densities from deep inelastic and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering data .",
    "therefore , as will become even more clear in the following , careful attention to the lorentz structure in the parton model with on - shell partons , i.e.  with @xmath19 , has dramatic consequences .",
    "given the standard belief that the _ soft _ functions appearing in qcd have support only in a very narrow range of values of @xmath33 around @xmath19 , it is tempting to suppose that the results derived in this paper may not be too different from those holding in a full qcd treatment .",
    "covariant parton models have been discussed in the literature for many decades , beginning with the work of landshoff , polkinghorne and short in 1971  @xcite , and franklin in 1977  @xcite .",
    "these papers dealt only with the unpolarized structure functions @xmath34 .",
    "the collinear spin - dependent structure functions @xmath35 were studied , in response to the  spin crisis in the parton model \" , by jackson , roberts and ross  @xcite , who also commented upon some aspects of quark transverse momentum .",
    "more recently , a very detailed study of covariant models was initiated by zavada in 1997  @xcite , and later developed by zavada  @xcite and efremov , teryaev and zavada  @xcite , to include the polarized parton densities as well as parton transverse momentum .",
    "while our paper was in its last phase of preparation we became aware of a further paper by efremov , schweitzer , teryaev and zavada  @xcite ( which we shall refer to as estz ) and a very latest work by zavada  @xcite in which tmd parton distributions are discussed in detail .    in these papers",
    "the analysis is based upon reasonable assumptions about the structure of the quark wave function in the nucleon _ rest _ frame . because the treatment is covariant the results",
    "can then be translated to any other lorentz frame .",
    "it is remarkable that many of the results of this kind of analysis are in complete agreement with our more general , frame independent , treatment .",
    "the principal differences are that : _ i _ ) in our treatment the three leading twist densities , the unpolarized density @xmath23 , the longitudinal density @xmath36 and the transversity density @xmath37 or @xmath38 are _ independent _ , whereas in the zavada et al .",
    "papers only two of these are independent ; _ ii _ ) we take into account target mass corrections .",
    "because our approaches are so different , we believe it will be instructive to present our derivation in full .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section  [ corr ] we discuss the hadronic correlator for polarized dis in the parton model , with @xmath17 , and give the general expression of the structure functions @xmath39 and @xmath0 ; in section  [ coeff ] we evaluate explicitly @xmath39 and @xmath0 including target - mass corrections and derive the ww relation ; in section  [ tmd ] we extend our analysis to the tmd quark distributions and discuss the consequences of imposing lorentz invariance ; in section  [ bounds ] we examine the positivity and soffer bounds for the @xmath1-dependent unpolarized , longitudinally and transversely polarized quark distributions , discuss how their correct implementation leads to new , more stringent , bounds on the @xmath1-integrated collinear distributions and show some phenomenological implications of this approach ; finally , in section  [ concl ] we give some additional comments and conclusions .",
    "the correlator @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the momentum and spin - polarization 4-vectors for the nucleon ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath14 is the quark 4-momentum and @xmath45 are dirac indices , is defined by @xmath46 to preserve colour gauge invariance a path - ordered wilson line ( or gauge - link ) should be inserted between the quark fields .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the @xmath17 case , we will take this operator as the identity .",
    "we ignore for the moment flavour and the quark charge ",
    "they are trivially reinstated at the end  and , as already stated , work with @xmath18 . by partial integration",

    ", we see that the violation of the stronger positivity bound at @xmath253 persists up to some relatively large values of @xmath172 .",
    "a similar behaviour should result for any value of @xmath32 in the region of violation of the positivity bound at @xmath253 , shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "( [ wa2 ] ) .",
    "finally , notice from the right panel that , as expected , the validity of the soffer - type bound at @xmath253 guarantees its validity at any allowed value of @xmath172 .",
    "analogous results for @xmath243 quarks are presented in fig .",
    "[ d - x02-k ] , and similar comments hold on the violation , this time , of the soffer - type bound .    for completeness , in fig .",
    "[ kt2-x ] we show the resulting mean transverse momentum squared , @xmath181 , eq .  ( [ ave - k2 ] ) , as a function of @xmath32 , for @xmath242 and @xmath243 quarks , at the same reference scale , @xmath244 gev@xmath174 .",
    "we briefly note that the shape of @xmath181 is quite reasonable and approximately flavour - independent , although its size is considerably smaller than expected from available phenomenological analyses within the tmd approach  @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps a hint that the larger values of @xmath262 needed in the phenomenological analyses may be due to hard gluon emission and may therefore not be a measure of the size of the genuinely intrinsic transverse momentum .",
    "it would be interesting to construct models based upon such a picture .",
    "we have shown that the simple parton model has a very rich structure when due care is given to its lorentz properties .",
    "on the basis that _ kinematic _ relations should not depend on the value of the strong coupling @xmath20 , and thus should be valid when @xmath17 , we have been able to give a simple derivation of the exact target mass corrections for polarized dis , without recourse to the operator product expansion , and have verified that the wandzura - wilczek relation holds when target mass corrections are included .",
    "we have also demonstrated that that there is a surprising and intimate connection between the intrinsic @xmath1 dependence of parton densities and the functional form of the @xmath1-integrated collinear densities .",
    "indeed the @xmath1 dependence can actually be _ derived _ from the collinear densities .",
    "using some published versions of the collinear densities we have studied the implications of this relationship and found that our @xmath1-dependent distributions , thus derived , are much narrower than those used in phenomenological work i.e.  our @xmath262 is much smaller .",
    "this suggests that some of the @xmath1 dependence usually described as intrinsic , may , in fact , be due to gluon radiation .",
    "one outcome of our work is the clear demonstration that the factorized form @xmath263 often used in phenomenological studies , is untenable , _ at least when @xmath17_. while not proved , it seems likely that this result is quite general , though , as commented on , a factorized form does seem a reasonable starting point for the analysis of the presently available data .",
    "in addition , because of this interrelationship between @xmath1 and @xmath32 dependence , we have been able to derive new positivity and soffer - type bounds on the collinear densities , which are stronger than the those usually utilized in dis and sidis analyses .",
    "we have shown numerically that some of the published collinear parton densities , which satisfy the traditional bounds , do not always satisfy these stronger bounds .",
    "the particular case of the down - quark transversity may be of some interest .",
