    "dwarf galaxies ( @xmath5 - 18 ) are the most common objects in the nearby universe ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "their importance resides in the fact that they represent in cold dark matter models the building blocks of hierarchical galaxy formation ( e.g. white & rees 1978 , white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "their study is thus fundamental for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "+ observations of dwarf galaxies , necessarily limited to the nearby universe , revealed however a more complex origin than that predicted by models , making this class of galaxies even more interesting . among dwarf galaxies , dwarf ellipticals ( de ) and the less luminous dwarf spheroidals ( dsph )",
    "are more common than star forming i m and bcds ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "firstly thought as the low - luminosity extension of bright ellipticals , several observational evidences indicate that they form an independent class of objects ( bender et al .",
    "dwarf and giant ellipticals have sersic light profiles of index @xmath6 , with @xmath7 progressively increasing with luminosity ( graham & guzman 2003 ; gavazzi et al .",

    "2005a ) integrated color magnitude relations , the subsolar [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios ( van zee et al .",
    "2004a ) and the uv to near - ir spectral energy distribution of de in the virgo cluster ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2002a ) , however , all indicate a more gradual star formation history with recent episodes of activity in these low - luminosity quiescent systems than in massive ellipticals .",
    "this constitutes the first evidence against their very old origin .",
    "a further disagreement with model predictions is that , although more frequent than bright galaxies , their number density is still significantly smaller than predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation for the field luminosity function ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ; cole et al . 1994",
    "; somerville & primack 1999 , nagashima et al . 2005 ) or for the local group ( klypin et al . 1999 ; bullock et al . 2000 ) .",
    "+ the strong similarities in the structural properties of star forming and quiescent dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe , namely their similar optical morphology and light profiles ( both roughly exponentials ) , suggested that dwarf ellipticals might result from gas removal and subsequent suppression of star formation in gas rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "gas removal might result either from its blowout due to the kinetic energy injected into the ism by supernova explosion following a strong burst of star formation ( dekel & silk 1986 , vader 1986 , yoshii & arimoto 1987 ) , gas exhaustion through subsequent episodes of star formation ( davies & phillipps 1988 ) , or from external perturbations induced by the hostile environment in which galaxies evolve .",
    "external perturbations include tidally induced mass loss in high speed encounters ( moore et al . 1998 ) , tidal stirring ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) and ram - pressure stripping induced by nearby companions ( lin & faber 1983 ) or by the hot intergalactic medium in massive clusters ( van zee et al .",
    "+ several observational evidences favor the environmental scenario against the gas blowout due to supernova explosions .",
    "the clearest indication that the environment plays an important role in the formation and evolution of dwarfs is the morphology segregation effect ( dressler 1980 ) which extends to low - luminosity systems ( binggeli et al . 1988 ; 1990 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore it has been recently claimed that the removal of the ism through supernova winds is quite difficult in low - luminosity , dark matter dominated systems ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ; silich & tenorio - tagle 1998 , 2001 ) . the discrete star formation history of several dwarf galaxies in the local group , as deduced by the analysis of their colour magnitude relation ( mateo 1998 ; grebel 1999 ) , is a further indication that dwarf spheroidals can retain their ism through several episodes of star formation . +",
    "another observational evidence favoring the transformation of star forming galaxies into quiescent dwarf ellipticals is the presence of rotationally supported ( pedraz et al .",

    "+ not all observational evidences , however , are consistent with the transformation of dwarf star forming galaxies into dwarf ellipticals under the effect of the environment . to reproduce the color magnitude relation of dwarf ellipticals ,",
    "it has been claimed that magellanic irregulars should have faded @xmath9 1.5 magnitudes in the b band thus reaching surface brightnesses weaker than @xmath10 @xmath11 25 mag arcsec@xmath12 , values significantly smaller than the observed ones ( bothun et al .",
    "most of the bright dwarf ellipticals in the virgo cluster have a bright nucleus ( binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) of small size , as shown by hst observations ( @xmath9 4 pc , cte et al .",
    "2006 ) while dwarf irregulars do not . while both dwarf irregulars and dwarf ellipticals follow different metallicity - luminosity relations , dwarf spheroidals are more metal - rich than dwarf irregulars at the same optical luminosity ( grebel et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the flattening distribution of non nucleated de is similar to that of late - type spirals , i m and bcd ( binggeli & popescu 1995 ) .",
    "this class of objects , however , is significantly less round than nucleated systems .",
    "although they exist , the fraction of objects belonging to the intermediate dirr / de transition class is too small .",
    "furthermore a simple transformation of i m galaxies recently infalling in the cluster into de does not seem to reproduce the observed difference in the cluster and field luminosity functions ( conselice 2002 ) .",
    "other strong constraints against the transformation of star forming into quiescent dwarfs are given by the studies of globular clusters , taken as a probe of the early phases of galaxy formation .",
    "the specific frequency of globular clusters in dwarf ellipticals , in fact , is significantly higher than that of star forming galaxies .",
    "this result has been interpreted as an evidence for a different formation scenario for the two galaxy populations ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ; strader et al .",
    "+ with the aim of explaining these evidences , slightly different evolutionary scenarios have been proposed : cluster dwarf ellipticals might have been formed from higher surface brightness bcd galaxies ( bothun et al . 1986 ) , or from tidally induced mass loss in multiple high speed encounters of massive galaxies ( galaxy harassment ; mastropietro et al .",
    "alternatively , lisker et al .",
    "( 2006a ; 2006b ; 2007 ) proposed that the cluster dwarf elliptical galaxy population is composed of different subcategories of objects , of which not all have been formed from gas stripped star forming dwarfs . as here emphasized the issue is still hotly debated .",
    "+ a few years ago we started collecting multifrequency data covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum for galaxies in nearby clusters in order to study the effects of the environment on galaxy evolution . up to now our research",
    "was primarily focused on the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "our interest covered the present and past star formation activity ( gavazzi et al .",

    "the results of our analysis , combined with those obtained by other teams , are summarized in a recent review article ( boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to extend the multifrequency analysis to the low - luminosity end of the luminosity function with the purpose of studying the possible transformation of star forming objects into dwarf ellipticals .",
    "this exercise is here done using a complete sample of galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "the novelty of this work compared to previous investigations is twofold : the analyzed sample has an unprecedented multifrequency spectral coverage from the uv to near - ir imaging data .",
    "furthermore this unique dataset is compared to the predictions of multizone chemo - spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution here adapted to take into account the perturbations induced by the cluster environment . the type of perturbation simulated by the models are ram - pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) and starvation ( larson et al . 1980 ) .",
    "the combination of multifrequency data with these models on the galaxies ngc 4569 ( boselli et al .",
    "2006 ) and ngc 4438 ( boselli et al .",
    "2005b ) indeed indicated how powerful this method is for studying and constraining the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "+ our previous investigations have emphasized that the most important parameter governing the evolution is the total mass as traced by the near - ir h band luminosity ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1996 ; 2002a ; boselli et al .",
    "2001 ) . below a certain mass ( @xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath2 l@xmath3 )",
    "we identify the sequence of dwarf galaxies that we subdivide into quiescent and star forming disregarding their detailed morphology .",
    "+ a major uncertainty in the interpretation of the multifrequency data , and in particular of those at short wavelength , is the extinction correction , which however is expected to be minor in low - metallicity star forming dwarf systems ( buat & xu 1996 ) and probably negligible in dwarf ellipticals .",
    "for these reasons we decided to limit the present analysis to the cluster dwarf galaxy population , leaving the discussion relative to massive galaxies to a future communication . with the aim of driving the reader",
    "s attention to the scientific results of this work , the presentation of the dataset and the general description of the models are given in appendix .",
    "the analysis presented in this work is based on an optically selected sample of galaxies in the virgo cluster ( 12h @xmath1 r.a.(2000 ) @xmath113h ; 0@xmath13 @xmath1 dec @xmath1 18@xmath13 ) extracted from the virgo cluster catalogue ( vcc ) of binggeli et al .",

    "the detailed description of the used dataset is given in the appendix .",
    "the evolution of galaxies is traced using the multi - zone chemical and spectro - photometric models of boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) , updated with an empirically - determined star formation law ( boissier et al@xmath18 2003 ) relating the star formation rate to the total - gas surface densities , and modified to simulate the effects induced by the interaction with the cluster igm . in the starvation scenario ( larson et al .",
    "1980 , balogh et al .",
    "2000 , treu et al . 2003 ) , the cluster acts on large scales by removing any extended gaseous halo surrounding the galaxy , preventing further infall of such gas onto the disk .",

    "starvation has been simulated by stopping infall in the model .",
    "+ the ism of galaxies crossing the cluster with velocities of @xmath9 1000 km s@xmath19 can be removed by the ram pressure exerted by the hot and dense igm ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "gas removal induces a quenching of the star formation activity ( boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) .",
    "the ram pressure stripping event is simulated by assuming a gas - loss rate inversely proportional to the potential of the galaxy , with an efficiency depending on the igm gas density radial profile of the virgo cluster given by vollmer et al .",

    "here we present their results .",

[ figure1 ] to [ figure5 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath25 color index is barely affected , because starvation acts on longer timescales than the lifetimes of the stellar populations emitting in the two uv filters ( @xmath4 10@xmath26 years ) , and does not totally eliminate these populations as significant amount of star formation , although reduced , still takes place .",
    "+ gas metallicity increases more than in the unperturbed case since newly formed metals are diluted in smaller amounts of gas , and since the metallicity is not reduced by the infall of pristine gas ( fig . [ figure4 ] ) .",
    "+ the effects of starvation on the structural properties of galaxies ( provided that the interaction started a long time ago ) are major .",
    "the decrease of the surface brightness is expected to be @xmath9 1 mag in the h band to @xmath9 3 mag in the fuv band for an interaction started 6 gyr ago ( fig .",

    "+ the effects of starvation on the effective radius are minor since starvation is a global effect , and thus does not depend on radius .",
    "nevertheless , an effect on the effective radius is visible , especially at short wavelengths .",
    "the reason is the radial dependence of infall ( galaxies are formed inside - out in our model ) .",
    "when the starvation starts , infall has occurred in the inner zones , where relatively large amount of gas can be found ( and thus high level of star formation and uv surface brightness ) .",
    "this gas is progressively depleted by star formation , leading to a decrease of the inner surface brightness while the outer parts , where the star formation is low because of the low amount of gas present , dim at a lower rate .",
    "the net effect is an increase in the effective radius .",
    "the effects of a ram - pressure stripping event started 1 gyr ago ( @xmath27=1 gyr ) on the evolution of total gas content , star formation activity , stellar populations ( uv to near - ir color indices ) , metallicity and structural ( effective radius and surface brightness ) parameters of dwarf galaxies as predicted by our models are also shown in fig .",

    "the star formation rate is fed by this recycled gas , and increases as well , staying nevertheless at low levels . in models with a lower ram pressure efficiency ,",
    "the recycled gas represents a small amount with respect to the one left after the interaction . as a result ,",
    "this effect is not visible : the gas and the star formation rate are about constant after the event .",
    "+ stopping the star formation makes galaxies redder . since the decrease of the star formation activity is rapid , the younger stellar populations , those emitting in the fuv and nuv filters , are the most affected : the @xmath23 color index , for instance , increases by @xmath9 4.5 magnitudes in 1 gyr , while @xmath24 by only 1 magnitude .",
    "+ as for the starvation scenario , the gas metallicity index significantly increases with time .",
    "the increase of the gas metallicity is higher during a ram pressure stripping event since virtually all the gas has been removed , while some gas is left in the disk during a starvation event .",

    "stopping the star formation drastically changes the structural properties of galaxies .",

    "[ figure5 ] ) . , the effective radius presents large variations in its value after ram pressure started .",
    "this is due to the fact that the galaxy is left with very low amount of gas , and the effective radius becomes sensitive to two opposite effects . in a first phase ,",
    "the dominant effect is that the inner disk is depleted through star formation at a larger rate than the outer disk , leading to an increase of @xmath30 ( like in the starvation case ) . in a second phase",
    ", the inner disk is partially replenished with recycled gas ( ejected at the end of the life of long - lived stars ) , leading this time to a decrease of @xmath30 . ] + an accurate comparison between the effects induced by ram - pressure stripping and starvation on dwarf galaxy properties indicates that the former interaction is more efficient than the latter in removing gas and suppressing any star formation activity in galaxies on short time scales . to be efficient , starvation should have started several gyr ago .",
    "recent ram pressure stripping events , however , did not have enough time to perturb the old stellar component emitting in the near - ir . + the effects of multiple encounters on the gas content and star formation activity of a dwarf , star forming galaxy of spin parameter @xmath21 = 0.05 and rotational velocity @xmath20 = 55 km s@xmath19 are shown in fig .

    "the resulting models are extremely similar to those presented in boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) and show the same global trends .",
    "we consider the star formation law as fixed and we keep the same mass accretion ( infall ) histories as in boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) , based on the assumption that before the interaction with the cluster , galaxies were `` normal '' spirals .",
    "the free parameters in this grid of models are the spin parameter , @xmath21 and the rotational velocity , @xmath20 .",
    "these two parameters are theoretical quantities , although @xmath20 should be similar to the asymptotic value of the rotation curve at large radii .",
    "the spin parameter is a dimensionless measure of the specific angular momentum ( defined in e.g. mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "its value in spirals ranges typically between @xmath9 0.02 for relatively compact galaxies to @xmath9 0.09 for low surface brightness galaxies ( boissier & prantzos 2000 ) .",
    "the models of boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) contains scaling relationships ( the total mass varies as @xmath101 , the scale - length as @xmath102 ) .",
    "star formation histories depend on the infall timescales , which are a function of @xmath20 in these models , so that roughly speaking , @xmath20 controls the stellar mass accumulated during the history of the galaxy , and @xmath21 its radial distribution . + in order to avoid the multiplication of parameters , we decided to fix the spin parameter to an average value of 0.05 and investigate global trends linked to the mass -or the velocity of galaxies- or to the interaction itself .",
    "other values of the spin parameter should mostly create some scatter around these trends . from e.g.",
    "boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) , it can be seen that trends are mostly driven by mass ( see their figure 8) .",
    "various spin parameters create a modest dispersion with respect to the average one ( e.g. about a few tenths of magnitude for the b - k colour index , a few tenths of dex for stellar and gaseous masses ... ) .",
    "the only quantities which are clearly much more affected by the spin parameter than the velocity are the surface brightnesses .",
    "the central surface brightness in the b band ( or @xmath103 band , see boissier 2000 ) can change by a few mag arcsec@xmath12 for a given circular velocity when using various realistic spin parameters .    to sample the whole dynamic range covered by dwarf galaxies we focused our analysis to the velocity range 40 - 100 km s@xmath19 , although we tested several other models for larger velocities ( for comparison with bright spirals ) .",
    "we remind that the model , which has a resolution of @xmath9 1 kpc , does not include any bulge or nuclear component , corresponding well to pure exponential disks such as these dwarf star forming galaxies ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2000a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the models were developed and extensively tested for relative massive galaxies ( rotation velocities above 80 km s@xmath19 ) . in this work ,",
    "we are interested mostly in the 40 - 100 km s@xmath19 range , and low velocity models were simply extrapolated from the massive ones . by this , we mean that we assumed that the star formation law , initial mass function and other ingredients used for massive galaxies also apply to the low mass case .",
    "especially , the models include a dependence of infall time scales on the circular velocity ( more massive galaxies form the bulk of their stars earlier than lower mass galaxies ) .",
    "this assumption was found to be in agreement with observations in normal spirals , above @xmath9 80 km / s ( boissier & prantzos , 2000 ) , and is here generalized to lower masses .",
    "these considerations call for some caution in the interpretation of our results . especially , low mass galaxies are very small and the models do not take into account the likely radial mixing on scales smaller than @xmath9 1 kpc , making them extremely uncertain with respect to e.g. metallicity gradients .",
    "nevertheless , we show in this paper that our extrapolated models reproduce reasonably well the properties of normal late type low velocity galaxies ( magnitudes , colors ... ) .",
    "in addition , errors due to model uncertainties are likely to be systematic effects : they should affect less differences between two models than absolute values .",
    "thus , we believe that the differences obtained when ram - pressure is introduced with respect to the unperturbed case can be trusted .",
    "the models of boissier & prantzos ( 2000 ) provide total luminosities and colors in all bands as well as the total gas content .",
    "they do not compute the nebular emission , but we estimated the h@xmath8 emission by using the number of ionizing photons predicted by version 5 of starburst 99 ( vazquez & leitherer 2005 ) for a single generation of stars distributed on the kroupa et al .",

    "the model spectral resolution is actually quite poor ( 20   in the visible ) but we checked that the evolution of this index in the case of a burst is consistent with the one presented in e.g. tantalo & chiosi ( 2004 ) .",
    "+ the evolution of the metallicity is computed in the models taking into account the yields , finite lifetimes of stars , infall of pristine gas ( boissier & prantzos 1999 ) .",
    "the spectra are computed taking into account this metallicity and the star formation history .",
    "given the agreement between model predictions and observations for different samples of unperturbed galaxies ( boissier & prantzos 1999 ; 2000 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ; boissier et al .",
    "2001 ) , we will consider them as the reference models for the unperturbed case .",
    "as for ngc 4569 ( boselli et al .",
    "2006 ) we study two different interaction scenarios , starvation and ram - pressure stripping .      in the starvation scenario ( larson et al . 1980 , balogh et al .",
    "2000 , treu et al . 2003 ) , the cluster acts on large scales by removing any extended gaseous halo surrounding the galaxy , preventing further infall of such gas onto the disk .",
    "the galaxy then become anemic simply because it exhausts the gas reservoir through on - going star formation .",
    "+ infall is a necessary assumption in models of the chemical evolution of the milky way to account for the g - dwarf metallicity distribution ( tinsley 1980 ) and is supported by some chemo - dynamical models ( samland et al .",
    "as the disk galaxy models were obtained through a generalization of the milky way model , infall is present in all our models .",
    "it is a schematic way to describe the growth of any galaxy from a proto - galactic clump in the distant past to a present - day galaxy .",
    "infall time scales in the models were chosen to reproduce the properties of present day normal galaxies ( boissier & prantzos 2000 , boissier et al .",
    "this includes a dependency on the rotational velocity such that infall in low mass galaxies is shifted towards later time : this mimics the fact that massive galaxies are formed early on and that low mass galaxies are still forming at the current time , a well known fact ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1996 , 2002 ; boselli et al .",
    "2001 ) nowadays called `` downsizing '' . because of this effect , low mass galaxies , in the absence of interaction , are accreting large amounts of gas and are still actively forming stars . in the event of starvation ,",
    "the galaxy stops accreting gas , and continue forming stars from the reservoir already present in the disk .",
    "this proceed at a lower rate than in the unperturbed case , with a declining activity in time as the consumed gas is not replaced with fresh gas . stopping infall ( in order to mimic starvation ) at a given time is straightforward to include in the model .",
    "we shall call @xmath104 the elapsed time since the infall termination ( look back time ) .",
    "in addition to the starvation scenario we can study the effect of ram - pressure gas stripping . as in boselli et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we adopt the plausible scenario of vollmer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) explicitly tailored to virgo : i.e. , the galaxies being modeled have crossed the dense igm only once ( in its simplest version ) , on elliptical orbits .",
    "the ram pressure exerted by the igm on the galaxy ism varies in time following a gaussian profile , whose peak at ( @xmath105=@xmath27 ) is when the galaxy is crossing the dense cluster core at high velocity ( @xmath105 and @xmath27 are look - back times , where the present epoch corresponds to @xmath105=0 ) .",
    "the gaussian has a width @xmath106 = 9 @xmath59 10@xmath64 years ( see fig@xmath18  3 of vollmer et al .",
    "we make the hypothesis that the gas at each radius is removed at a rate that is directly proportional to the galaxy gas column density @xmath96 and inversely proportional to the potential of the galaxy , measured by the total ( baryonic ) local density @xmath107 ( provided by the model ) .",
    "the gas - loss rate adopted is then equal to @xmath108 @xmath109 , with the efficiency @xmath108 following a gaussian having a maximum @xmath28 at the time @xmath27 , chosen to mimic the variation of the ram pressure suggested by vollmer et al .",
    "this very simple , but physically - motivated prescription should allow us to model the gas removal from galaxies using only two free parameters ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) to age - date and measure the magnitude of this effect .",
    "to further constrain the models we assume two different values of @xmath28 : the first is @xmath28 = 1.2 m@xmath29 kpc@xmath12 yr@xmath19 , the value best reproducing the radial profiles of ngc 4569 ( boselli et al . , 2006 ) , the second one is one third of it , @xmath28 = 0.4 m@xmath29 kpc@xmath12 yr@xmath19 .",
    "this second value is suggested by the following considerations : besides the potential of the galaxy , which is an intrinsic property of each object , the efficiency of ram - pressure ( @xmath63 ) stripping depends on the density of the cluster intergalactic medium ( @xmath110 ) , on the crossing velocity of the galaxy within the cluster ( @xmath111 ) and on its orientation with respect to its motion ( boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) : @xmath63 = @xmath110 @xmath112 .",
    "statistically speaking , the line of sight velocity dispersion of star forming galaxies in the cluster is 1150 km s@xmath19 , and drops to 766 km s@xmath19 if limited to low luminosity star forming objects in the virgo a subgroup from where the x ray emission comes from .",
    "these values can be compared to the line of sight velocity of ngc 4569 with respect to the cluster center , which is 1374 km s@xmath19 . to test other realistic models we thus decided to use an @xmath28 lower by a factor of @xmath9 ( 1374/766)@xmath113 = 3.2 than in ngc 4569 .",
    "@xmath28 = 0.4 m@xmath29 kpc@xmath12 yr@xmath19 can thus be considered as an average value of relatively weak interactions while @xmath28 = 1.2 m@xmath29 kpc@xmath12 yr@xmath19 is a realistic value representative of more extreme interactions .",
    "as we discuss in the main body of the paper , @xmath28 = 0.4 m@xmath29 kpc@xmath12 yr@xmath19 leads to hi - deficiency parameters of @xmath9 0.8 for massive galaxies , consistent with the average hi - deficiency observed within one virial radius in virgo , while @xmath28 = 1.2 m@xmath29 kpc@xmath12 yr@xmath19 to hi - deficiencies of @xmath9 1.5 , close to the highest values found in virgo ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2005b ; boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) .",
    "in massive galaxies hi deficiencies as high as @xmath9 2 have been observed ( gavazzi et al . 2005 ) , and are probably the result of stripping events more efficient than those simulated .",
    "these extreme hi deficiencies can also be the result of subsequent crossings of the cluster center , that should happen on average every @xmath9 1.7 gyr ( boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) .",
    "multiple crossing can be reproduced by our models just considering that the average crossing time of star forming galaxies in the virgo cluster is 1.7 gyr ( boselli & gavazzi 2006 ) .",
    "+ we make the further assumption that no extra star formation is induced during the interaction .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since ram pressure stripping models of fujita ( 1998 ) and fujita & nagashima ( 1999 ) indicate that on short time scales ( @xmath9 10@xmath26 yr ) the star formation activity of galaxies can increase by up to a factor of 70% at most in high density , rich clusters such as coma , but it decreases to values lower than before the interaction whenever the density of the igm is relatively low as in the core of virgo .",
    "indeed we do not have any evidence of a statistically significant increase of the star formation activity in galaxies that recently underwent a ram - pressure stripping event ( iglesias - paramo et al .",
    "2004 ) . given the rapidity of the gas stripping process ( 150 myr , see sect .",
    "5.2 ) in these dwarf systems , a possible mild increase of their star formation activity does not have enough time to produce significant modification in their spectrophotometric and structural properties ."
