    "phase separation is the process whereby a binary mixture of components @xmath5 and @xmath9 , initially in a homogeneous phase , demix leading to the coexistence of two phases , one rich in @xmath5 and the other in @xmath9 . the system , initially in an unstable spatially uniform state , performs a coarsening process to approach its thermodynamically stable phase - separated state  @xcite .    in the case of fluids , hydrodynamic effects may be important to the demixing process @xcite ; these interactions are hard to treat analytically and the results of numerical simulations are sometimes controversial .",
    "some studies even claim that dynamical scaling is broken by hydrodynamic transport @xcite . in the following we focus on the phase separation process in systems without hydrodynamics .",
    "a typical realization is phase separation in binary alloys , high - viscosity fluids and polymer blends .",
    "the time - dependent order parameter characterising the phase separation phenomenon is a continuous scalar field , @xmath10 , that represents the local difference in concentration of the two phases normalized by the sum of the averaged concentrations .",

    "the stochastic field @xmath13 represents a conserved thermal noise , while the mobility @xmath14 is in general a function of the field @xmath15 , as indicated . when @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) is known as the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite , or model @xmath9 in the hohenberg - halperin classification of critical dynamics  @xcite .",
    "several discrete models to study the phase - separation process in binary alloys have also been proposed and studied in the literature .",
    "these are lattice gases that are themselves mapped onto ising models with locally conserved order parameter  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics follow stochastic rules for the interchange of nearest neighbour @xmath5 and @xmath9 molecules or , in the spin language , the reversal of a pair of neighbouring antiparallel spins .",
    "two microscopic processes contribute to phase ordering dynamics with locally conserved order parameter , namely _ bulk _ and _ surface _ diffusion . in bulk diffusion",
    "a molecule separates ( evaporation ) from the surface of a domain , diffuses within the neighbouring domain of the opposite phase , and finally attaches to its original domain or another one . in the context of an ising model simulation",
    ", there is an activation energy for this process and one can check that the dominant growth mechanism is the transport of material through the bulk from domain boundaries with _",
    "large _ curvature to domain boundaries with _ small _ curvature . in surface diffusion molecules ` walk ' on the interface at no energy cost .",
    "this mechanism leads to the motion of whole domains in the sample and thus the possibility of merging two domains together when they collide . in the usual kawasaki",
    "@xcite spin - exchange dynamics or in model b s evolution  @xcite , the early dynamics is surface diffusion driven and at later time the dominant process becomes bulk diffusion .",
    "there exist , however , modified versions where either bulk or surface diffusion are suppressed  @xcite .    for deep temperature quenches , @xmath17 , bulk diffusion is effectively eliminated , and domain growth proceeds by surface motion . in quenches to moderate subcritical temperatures , on the other hand , the mobility does not play an important role , @xmath18 , and the domain growth is bulk - driven .",
    "let us now review in some detail the main features of coarsening with locally conserved order parameter . using the cahn - hilliard equation",
    ", it can be easily shown that the radius , @xmath19 , of a _ single spherical _ domain of negative phase ( @xmath20 ) in an infinite sea of positive phase ( @xmath21 ) , evolves from time @xmath22 to time @xmath23 as @xmath24 with @xmath25 a parameter that quantifies the surface tension . a domain with initial radius @xmath26",
    "thus evaporates in a time @xmath27 in contrast to the non - conserved order parameter dynamics in which the area within a boundary simply shrinks under the curvature force in a time @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "lifshitz - slyozov  @xcite and wagner  @xcite studied , for a _ three - dimensional _ system , the growth and shrinkage of domains of one phase embedded in one large domain of the other phase in the limit of small minority phase concentration , @xmath29 . in their celebrated papers",
    "they realized that domain growth at the late stages is limited by matter diffusion through the majority domain .",
    "in this case the evolution of a domain of the minority phase with radius @xmath26 immersed in a sea of the majority phase that is ` supersaturated ' with the dissolved minority species  @xcite can follow two paths : the domain evaporates by diffusion if @xmath30 , or it grows by absorbing material from the majority phase if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a time - dependent ` critical radius ' . this critical radius turns out to be the only characteristic length - scale in the system , @xmath33 , and serves to scale all correlation functions according to the dynamic scaling hypothesis .",
    "it grows as @xmath34 .",
    "lifshitz - slyozov  @xcite also derived an expression for the density of droplets of the minority phase with linear size @xmath35 in @xmath36 .",
    "three important properties of the lifshitz - slyozov distribution are :    * the distribution of droplet radii has an upper cut - off , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant , equal to 3/2 , times the critical radius @xmath39 . *",
    "the decay close to the cut - off is exponential . *",
    "the density of small objects , @xmath40 , satisfies scaling and behaves as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of droplets per unit volume with radius in the interval @xmath43 .",
    "later simulations established that the scaling functions depend on the minority concentration  @xcite .    the lifshitz - slyozov calculation can easily be extended to any space dimension @xmath44 @xcite . however , the limit @xmath45 is singular , and does not commute with the limit @xmath46 .",
    "rogers and desai @xcite showed , however , that the usual scaling forms apply in @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , for large @xmath23 at small non - zero volume fraction @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , huse used scaling and energetic arguments to generalize the lifshitz - slyozov growth law and argued that it should also apply to critical quenches with equal volume fractions of the two phases  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations  @xcite , in agreement also with the earlier ones in @xcite , suggest that the typical domain radius scales in time as @xmath49 for any value of @xmath3 , even in the 50:50 case .",
    "the scaling function for the distribution of domain areas has not been analyzed in this case .",
    "if we take also into account the competition between bulk and surface diffusion the growth law is modified at early times .",
    "the former process is the one responsible for the scaling of global observables with a _",
    "typical _ domain length @xmath50 while the latter yields a slower time - dependence , @xmath51 , that is important only at relatively short times after the quench  @xcite .",
    "the temperature - dependent crossover can be seen , for example , in numerical simulations with kawasaki dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the crossover time diverges when @xmath52 .",
    "this observation has been used to develop accelerated algorithms to simulate discrete models in which only bulk diffusion processes are considered , which should describe phase - separation correctly at late times after the quench .",
    "phase - separation in the kawasaki spin - exchange dynamics is equivalent to a cahn - hilliard equation with order parameter dependent mobility . in  @xcite , a model with @xmath53",
    "was studied .",
    "the time dependent structure factor exhibits dynamical scaling , and the scaling function is numerically indistinguishable from the cahn - hilliard one , consistent with what was expected from numerical studies with kawasaki dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we study the morphology of domain and perimeter structures in the spinodal decomposition of a two dimensional system with _ equal concentrations _ of the two phases .",
    "in particular , we analyse the distributions of the domain areas and their associated perimeters , and the relation between areas and perimeters during the evolution .",
    "we consider bulk - and - surface diffusion and just - bulk diffusion processes .    extending a formalism previously developed for the study of domain growth in the non - conserved case @xcite , we propose an analytic form for the domain size distribution function in its full - range of variation , and we test it with simulations on the two - dimensional ising model ( @xmath8im ) . our analytic prediction for the distribution of small areas is the result of one hypothesis : that interfaces move independently .",
    "this assumption is valid for domains of any size in curvature driven dynamics : the fission of a big domain into two smaller ones or the coalescence of two domains to form a bigger one are forbidden in the continuous allen - cahn description  @xcite , and are not important in the heat - bath dynamics of the ising model with non - conserved order parameter . in the conserved order parameter case , even with @xmath29 , this assumption does not strictly hold and corrections must , in principle , be included .",
    "indeed , already lifshitz and slyozov made an attempt to go beyond their simple model and account for coalescence when @xmath54 .",
    "later , it became clear that in locally conserved order parameter dynamics , the dominant effect not accounted for in the simple description that takes domain - boundaries as independent objects was interdomain correlations rather than coalescence .",
    "for a discussion of the limit @xmath55 considering interactions between droplets see  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our analytical results are just a ` first order ' approximation .",
    "still , as we shall see in the main body of the paper , this approximation yields a very good description of numerical data obtained with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the quantities on which we focus are domain areas and ` hull enclosed areas ' , where the latter are the areas enclosed within the outer boundaries ( or ` hulls ' ) of domains , and domain perimeters . the distribution functions for the hull enclosed and domain areas are @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the number of hulls ( h ) or domains ( d ) per unit area of the system with area in the range @xmath58 .",
    "the main properties of these distributions are :    * the number density of domain and hull - enclosed areas satisfy scaling : @xmath59 .",
    "the argument of the scaling functions arises from the fact that the characteristic area of hulls and domains grows as @xmath60 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath61 follows from the fact that there is of order one domain per scale area .",
    "* the scaling functions , @xmath62 , do not have any cut - off and extend to infinite values of @xmath63 falling - off as @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "the constants @xmath66 are the ones in the initial ( or quasi - initial  see below ) area distribution , @xmath67 , for @xmath68 . the prefactor @xmath69 is known exactly , @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the factor 2 is present when quenching from high temperature , @xmath71 , and is absent when the initial condition is the critical ising one , @xmath72 .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 depends on whether we consider hull - enclosed ( @xmath73 or domain areas , and in the latter case on the initial condition , _",
    "i.e. _ infinite or critical temperature . in both cases",
    "it is very close to @xmath74 . * after a quench from high temperature to a sufficiently low working temperature , @xmath75 , the small - argument behaviour of the scaling function is @xmath76 , in agreement with the lifshitz - slyozov - wagner prediction for the small concentration limit . at higher working temperature and for critical initial conditions",
    "the behaviour is modified in a way that we describe in the text .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : analytic ] we describe an approximate analytic derivation of the time - dependent hull enclosed and domain area distributions .",
    "these arguments do not rely on any scaling hypothesis but rather support its validity .",
    "we compare our approach to the celebrated lifshitz - slyozov - wagner theory  @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] we show our numerical results for the statistics of areas in the @xmath8im evolving with locally conserved dynamics .",
    "we use variants  @xcite of the kawasaki algorithm  @xcite that we briefly explain in this section .",
    "the use of different algorithms allows us to switch surface diffusion on and off , and pinpoint the relative importance of these processes .",
    "section  [ sec : domain - walls ] is devoted to the analysis , both analytical and numerical , of the geometry of domain walls during the dynamics and their relation to the corresponding areas .",
    "finally , in the conclusion we summarize our results and we discuss future studies along these lines .",
    "in this section we analyze the number density of hull - enclosed and domain areas .",
    "a domain is a region of connected aligned spins .",
    "each domain has one external perimeter which is called the hull .",
    "the hull - enclosed area is the total area within this perimeter , _",
    "i.e. _ the domain area plus the area of any internal sub - domains .",
    "we study the coarsening dynamics after a quench from @xmath77 and @xmath72 .",
    "the first case is very similar to critical percolation , as we explained in @xcite .",
    "equilibrium infinite temperature initial conditions ( fraction of up spins @xmath78 ) are below the critical random percolation point ( @xmath79 ) for a square lattice in @xmath47 .",
    "after a few mc steps , however , the system reaches the critical percolation condition , e.g.  the expected @xmath80 tail is observed in the distribution of hull enclosed areas .",
    "we have checked that this is so from the analysis of several correlation functions as well as the distribution of structures .",
    "the same happens for non - conserved order parameter dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this fact justifies the use of the cardy - ziff exact result for the distribution of hull - enclosed areas at critical percolation  @xcite as our effective initial condition from @xmath77 . from a more general perspective",
    ", one can argue that if the system is coarse - grained to the scale @xmath81 , and @xmath81 is large compared to the lattice spacing , a continuum description becomes appropriate , for which the percolation threshold is precisely @xmath82 . at the scale @xmath81 , the system is disordered and has the character of the percolation model at threshold .",
    "in section ii in @xcite we recalled the equilibrium distribution of hull - enclosed and domain areas , domain walls and their geometrical relation to their associated areas at critical percolation and critical ising initial conditions . in section",
    "iii we derived some generic results that follow from the use of sum rules and the scaling hypothesis .",
    "we do not repeat the description of these properties here but we refer the reader to @xcite for further details .    for future reference",
    "we simply list here the initial distributions , @xmath83 , of hull - enclosed and domain areas @xcite : @xmath84 where the exponent @xmath4 describes the critical ising state and @xmath85 the critical percolation state .",
    "the expression for @xmath86 is asymptotically exact for areas @xmath87 large compared to the microscopic area , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the factor 2 is present for critical percolation but absent for the critical ising initial condition @xcite . in the former case , the `` initial '' time @xmath90 is taken to be a few mc steps , such that the system has effectively reached the percolative critical state .",
    "the constant @xmath69 is known analytically , @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the expressions for @xmath91 require a little more discussion .",
    "the key point is that the constant @xmath69 is very small ( @xmath92 ) , so that `` domains - within - domains '' are rare . as a consequence ,",
    "the domain area distributions are very similar to the corresponding distributions of hull enclosed areas . however , as discussed at length in @xcite , the domain area distributions must fall off faster than @xmath80 in order that the total domain area , per unit area of the system , be finite ( and equal to unity ) .",
    "the smallness of @xmath69 suggests that they will fall off only slightly faster than @xmath80 , and indeed the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : initial - domains - tc ] ) take the numerical values @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "formally , if @xmath69 is regarded as a small parameter , one finds @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "this line of reasoning also accounts for the factor 2 that ( again to leading order in @xmath69 ) appears in the third of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : initial - domains - tc ] ) but not the second .",
    "it is by now well - established  @xcite that the spatial equal - time correlation function in demixing systems is correctly described by the dynamic scaling hypothesis with a characteristic length @xmath50 in agreement with the lifshitz - slyozov - wagner prediction  @xcite and the extension beyond the small concentration limit derived by huse  @xcite .",
    "the effect of temperature fluctuations is expected to be described by a @xmath98-dependent prefactor , @xmath99^{1/3}$ ] . in the following",
    "we do not write the @xmath98 dependence explicitly .",
    "it is natural to assume that at time @xmath23 , as for non - conserved order parameter dynamics , large structures , characterized by a long linear dimension @xmath100 , have not changed much with respect to the initial condition .",
    "we shall support this claim with the numerical results .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large hull - enclosed areas such that the time - dependence can be neglected we expect @xmath101    similarly , for large domains , the area dependence of their distribution follows that of the initial condition , eq .",

    "we shall assume that they are _",
    "independent_. moreover , they are not expected to have holes of the opposite phase within , implying the equivalence between hull - enclosed and domain areas at these scales . indeed ,",
    "any smaller structure placed within must have evaporated by time @xmath23 .",
    "we then propose that the number density of _ small _ hull - enclosed or domain areas at time @xmath23 can be written as a function of the initial distribution , @xmath103 with @xmath87 the initial area and @xmath104 their number density at the initial time @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath105 is the area of a domain at time @xmath23 that had area @xmath87 at time @xmath90 .",
