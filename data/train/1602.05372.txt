    "voting is a distributed decision making process involving several people.each participant called the voter casts a vote and the computations are performed on the vote casts by different voters to select the preferred item.voting can be modeled as a secure multi party computation system , since multiple parties submit input and obtain the result without knowing any details of other inputs .",
    "the process involved in traditional election is quite tedious , time and resource consuming . to overcome these difficulties",
    "e - voting system is introduced.the evolving new technologies made e - voting practical.but the research in this direction has to go a long way.the reliability and security are the major challenge.e - voting provides a lot of benefits compared with traditional voting.it avoids the requirement of geographical proximity of users.the cost can be greatly reduced because the resources can be reused .",
    "the use of e - voting must satisfy the security requirements such as authentication , voter privacy , confidentiality , integrity , etc.the security flaws make e - voting vulnerable than traditional system.gritzalis et al @xcite,@xcite mentioned the requirements of a secure e - voting system .",
    "confidentiality , authenticity , integrity and verifiability are the major security requirements in e - voting scenario.confidentiality ensures that nobody knows whom the voter is voted.authentication is an important process where each voter must be identified as a person he claims to be and he should not be allowed to vote again.integrity of the votes are also important.the system should ensure that the votes are valid and any modification must be detected.verifiability means any one can verify at later time that , the voting is properly performed or his vote was properly registered and has been taken into account in the final tally @xcite .    the are several proposal for efficient secret ballot elections based on mix - nets @xcite @xcite @xcite , homomorphic encryption @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and blind signatures @xcite @xcite .",
    "there are different methods addressing the security and reliability of the e - voting scheme.most of the approaches are based on cryptography.the major objective is to protect the voters identity from the vote.secure e - voting using blind signature is proposed in @xcite.rsa @xcite and blind signatures are the major cryptographic algorithms involved@xcite,@xcite.homomorphic encryption techniques are used in several implementations @xcite.several proposal for verifiable secret sharing schemes are also given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "several modifications and use of homomorphic encryption and verifiable secret shuffle are mentioned in @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "malkhi et al @xcite in 2003 gave constructions without cryptographic technique which uses secret sharing homomorphism.iftene @xcite in 2007 proposed a general secret sharing for e - voting using chinese remainder theorem .",
    "pailliar s crypto system and its application to voting is proposed by damagaard et al @xcite in 2010.discrete logarithm problem and secret sharing are used by chen et al @xcite in 2014.scheme with enhanced confidentiality and privacy is suggested by pan et al @xcite in 2014 .",
    "secret sharing and many variations of its form an important primitive in several security protocols and applications.in the proposed method we make of shamir s @xcite secret sharing techniques and its additive homomorphism property for efficient e - voting and vote tallying.hence it avoids the complicated encryption decryption process and key management.the secret sharing schemes are originally proposed by shamir @xcite and blackley @xcite in 1979 .",
    "the motivation was to safeguard cryptographic keys .",
    "the secret keys are stored at several locations as shares and when authorized number of users collaborate together , they can retrieve the secret.this provides both security , reliability and trust.the shares are information theoretically secure and provides no information about the key.the schemes are @xmath0 threshold schemes where any @xmath1 number of users can collaborate to recover the secret out of @xmath2 users.less than @xmath1 users can not obtain any information about the secret.secret sharing scheme is perfect if less than @xmath1 shares gives no information about the secret.the secret sharing scheme is ideal if the share size is same as the secret size.shamirs scheme is perfect and also ideal.it is easy to implement and is based on polynomial interpolation.blackleys scheme is not perfect.it is based on hyperplane geometry and it is difficult to implement.there are other schemes based on boolean operations @xcite @xcite and number theory @xcite @xcite .",
    "properties of polynomials give shamir s scheme a @xmath3 homomorphic property.the secret domain and the share domain is same ( integers modulo @xmath4).there are other schemes @xcite,@xcite which also have @xmath3 homomorphism , we consider shamir s scheme for the ease of implementation and also it is perfect and information theoretically secure .",
    "the homomorphism also provides verifiable secret sharing.it is very important in secure multi party computation.the first proposal of verifiable secret sharing was done by chor et al @xcite.in secret sharing not only the participant but also the dealer may be malicious.so the participant must be able to verify whether the shares are consistent.a set of @xmath2 shares is @xmath1 consistent if every subset of @xmath1 of the @xmath2 shares defines the same secret.publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme s are introduced by stadler in 1996 @xcite.schoenmakers @xcite in 1999 proposed a publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme(pvss ) with applications to e-voting.the scheme is better than @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the issue of homomorphic secret sharing for pvss is also discussed.an efficient pvss is suitable for the secure implementation of e - voting .",
    "the proposed scheme uses shamir s threshold @xmath0 secret sharing scheme @xcite , which is having all the required property for efficient implementation of e-voting.the cryptographic techniques used for e - voting makes use of several mathematical assumptions.the use of secret sharing homomorphism avoids these problems and provides perfect secrecy.this section explores shamir s secret sharing technique and the use of homomorphism property for e - voting .",
    "let @xmath5 , a @xmath0 secret sharing protocol allows the shares of the secret to be distributed to @xmath2 participants and any @xmath1 of them can collaborate to retrieve the secret.shamir @xcite uses a polynomial based construction for the implementation of @xmath0 threshold scheme.it is based on the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath6.also let @xmath7 , where @xmath4 is prime and @xmath8 are pairwise distinct.then there exist @xmath9 polynomial @xmath10 $ ] of degree @xmath11 with @xmath12    the polynomial can be obtained from the points @xmath13 using lagrange interpolation formula .",

    "@xmath17    we can obtain a system of linear equations from @xmath15 @xmath18 lets consider the coefficient matrix @xmath19    the coefficient matrix is a vandermonde matrix @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath20 are distinct the determinant @xmath21 is non zero and the coefficient matrix has rank @xmath22.thus the kernal of the coefficient matrix has rank @xmath23.so the number of polynomials is @xmath9 since each coefficient can take any of the @xmath4 values .",
    "+ the secret sharing protocol consist of following phases .",
    "+      in this phase , the dealer who wants to distribute the secret @xmath24 must choose a prime number @xmath4 larger than the secret and also @xmath4 must be greater than @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the number of participants.the dealer then choose different @xmath25 corresponds to each participants.the @xmath20 are then published .",

    "the shares , @xmath33 are then distributed to @xmath34th participants securely @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath1 or more participants collaborate together , they can retrieve the secret @xmath24 by combining the shares.let @xmath36 , be the @xmath1 shares.then by using lagrange interpolation , the polynomial of degree @xmath29 can be reconstructed from these @xmath1 points using the formula    @xmath14    as per theorem 1 , there is exactly one such polynomial of degree @xmath11 . the participants can obtain the secret @xmath24 as @xmath37    it is noted that less than @xmath1 share holders get no information about the secret.all constant term are equally likely and is an element in the field.the scheme is information theoretically secure .",
    "secret sharing homomorphism introduced by benaloh in 1987 @xcite.it is noted that shamir s scheme is additive homomorphic.he stated that any @xmath1 of the @xmath2 agents can determine the super secret and no conspiracy of fewer than @xmath1 agents can gain any information at all about any of the sub secrets .",
    "that is the sum of the shares of different sub secret when added up and then interpolate according to the threshold mentioned to obtain the master secret which is the sum of the sub secrets.he also mentioned the importance of secret sharing homomorphism to e - voting .",
    "shamir s secret sharing scheme has the ( + , + ) homomorphism property . for example , assume there are two secrets : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and are shared using polynomials @xmath40 and @xmath41.if we add the shares @xmath42 then each of these @xmath43 can be treated as the shares corresponds to the secret @xmath44.the polynomial @xmath45 and @xmath46 . but each voter choose 1 or 0 ( vote or no vote).the shares are send to @xmath2 tellers.any @xmath1 of them can collaborate to retrieve the result back .    in case of pvss ,",
    "two operations are defined.one on the shares @xmath47 , and the other operation @xmath48 on the encrypted shares such that for all participants @xmath49 if the underlying secret sharing scheme is homomorphic then by decrypting the combined encrypted shares , the recovered secret will be equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the proposed system is a modification of the existing electronic voting scheme s used in india.currently electronic voting machines are used in polling booth.these machines are costly and also not reliable.we propose an alternative solution for this using internet and secret sharing homomorphism.this add trust and reliability to the existing voting scheme by incorporating secret sharing based techniques.the secrecy of vote is an important issue.this needs to be addressed with ultimate care . in the current electronic voting system , when a vote is casted , the corresponding candidates data base entry is updated and it can be easily tracked.but in the proposed scheme , it is difficult to track the vote because the shares of the votes is added to all the servers .",
    "we also add trust to the existing scheme by maintaining more than one server to keep the voting details.we are not considering on - line verification of the authenticity of the voter as in general e - voting scheme.here we assume that the polling officers in each polling booth has to do it manually using the electoral role.the major components of the proposed e - voting schemes are    1 .",

    "share generation 3 .",
    "collection centers 4 .",
    "result computation    we have considered the user authentication process which is done manually.the voting takes place in a polling station.a voter is allowed to vote after his identity is verified .",
    "a polling station may contain many voting terminals.the user interface shows a voting panel which contains the list of all contesting candidates and their party symbols .",
    "voting panel is setup and managed by the chief election officers .",
    "the share generation module is responsible for receiving the vote casted by each voter and make shares of it according to the threshold secret sharing scheme .",
    "the shares are generated according to the vote casted for each candidates.each candidate vote is represented as an encoded binary code.so when a vote is casted , the shares of the decimal value corresponds to the encoded binary vote of each candidate is generated using the shamir s secret sharing scheme.the number of bits in the encoded binary code corresponds to each candidate vote depends on the number of contesting candidates and also total number of voters .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath51 candidates @xmath52 and @xmath2 voters @xmath53.then the binary encoding of the vote corresponds to each candidate will consist of @xmath54 number of bits.here we consider the fact that all voters may vote to the same candidate.so the number of bits required for the representation of votes for each candidate is equal to the number of bits required to represent the total number of voters which is @xmath55 .",
    "the encoding of the vote corresponds to each contesting candidate is explained below with an example.let us consider that there are three candidates and seven voters.so the total number of bits of each encoded vote will be nine.the bit pattern corresponds to the vote of each candidate is obtained by setting the corresponding bit @xmath56 to 1 in the code @xmath57 and other bits @xmath56 to 0.for example the code corresponds to the vote of candidate @xmath58 is @xmath59.so depending on the vote casted , it is encoded into a decimal code of 1,8 or 64 respectively.this bit wise encoding helps in computing the total votes obtained by each candidate using the additive homomorphism .",
    "the encoded vote is then shared using shamir s threshold secret sharing scheme.the shares are then send to different collection centres(cc).the collection centres are responsible for receiving and summing up the shares corresponds to each vote casted.we can set up the threshold and also set number of collection centres required.if there are @xmath4 collection centres @xmath60 and a threshold @xmath61 is set so that we can get back the result from any @xmath1 collection centres.this provides trust and reliability.based on the number of collection centres and threshold set up , shamir s scheme can be used for a threshold @xmath62 secret sharing.a @xmath29 degree polynomial @xmath63 is constructed with constant term representing the encoded vote value in decimal.the other coefficients are chosen randomly from the field @xmath64 , where @xmath4 is larger than the encoded vote values and the number of participants.the shares are generated by evaluating the polynomial @xmath63 at @xmath4 different values @xmath65.these @xmath65 values represent different collection centres known only to the chief election officer and are kept secret.these shares are then send securely to the @xmath4 collection centres.any @xmath1 of them can be used for result evaluation and verification.the shares look totally random and the collection centres have no idea regarding which secret ( vote ) share it is , from the share value.the share size is also same as the secret size and hence it provides information theoretical security . once all the collection centres receives the vote share ,",
    "the voting terminal is intimated to receive the next vote or it is the confirmation that the vote is registered properly .",
    "the collection centres are responsible for summing up the shares they receive for vote tallying.here the shares are always valid .",
    "they are generated automatically from the terminal program embedded.so there is no need to check the consistency of the shares received by the collection centres.but proper measures must be taken for the secure and error free communication between the voting terminal and collection centres.collection centres behave as group of authorized parties.in a real time voting scenario , a single machine can act as a collection centre by maintaining database which contains collection of shares.how ever in this case the collection centre must be trusted.we can maintain a hierarchy of collection centres for collecting vote shares according to the geographical location which compute the local sum of shares .",
    "the local sum is then send to the top level collection centres which further add the sums of shares received from local collection centres.a separate communication module can be incorporated for the efficient and secure communication of shares.the collection centres can also keep the shares received from each polling booth or booths belongs to the same area as a separate entity for the computation of region wise voting details.the strategy for share maintenance , number of collection centres etc can be determined based on the requirement.the implementation issues also depend on the hierarchal structure used .",
    "the result computation module is responsible for computing and declaring the final result.from the sum of shares stored on collection centres , the result can be obtained using lagrange interpolation.if there are @xmath4 collection centres and a @xmath62 threshold secret secret sharing scheme is used , then any @xmath1 of the share sum from the collection centres can be used for computing the final result.these @xmath1 shares can be used to get back a @xmath29 degree polynomial @xmath66 and the encoded result will be @xmath67.the result is then decoded by converting @xmath67 into binary and then separating the bits corresponds to each candidates.the decimal equivalent of the separated bits represent the total vote obtained by each candidate.based on this the result can be announced .",
    "it is noted that the result computation can not be performed by collection centres.they will just keep the share sum and a hash is computed which is then signed by the private keys of the collection centre.during the result computation , it can be verified for the integrity and authenticity.this result declaration module , is managed by higher officials and only they know the different @xmath68 values used for each collection centre during the share generation.any @xmath1 pairs of this @xmath68 values and the corresponding share sum , which is the @xmath69 values , the polynomial interpolation can be done.the result computation can be done with different combination of the share sum from @xmath1 different collection centres which adds reliability.the trust is maintained by the shamir s scheme because less than @xmath1 collection centres can not get any information about the final result.at least @xmath1 collection centres have to collate to get back the result .",
    "the following algorithm only includes the core functionality required.additional functionalities can be added depending on the requirement.suitable hash algorithm and signature algorithm must be chosen for maintaining the integrity and authenticity.when the voting is finished the hash of final share sum of each collection centre @xmath70 can be computed using sha(secure hash algorithm ) @xcite and is digitally signed by the previously issued private keys of the collection centre.the election official can verify this for integrity and authenticity .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the number of candidates and @xmath2 denote number of voters .",
    "+ set @xmath71 equals @xmath54 bits for encoding the votes .",
    "+ choose an appropriate field @xmath72    interpolate using @xmath70 and corresponding @xmath8 values to obtain the polynomial q(x ) + obtain the secret value @xmath67 .",
    "+ decode @xmath67 and obtain the binary representation .",
    "+ each @xmath73 bits will represent each candidates vote .",
    "+ publish the final results .",
    "let us assume that three people alice , bob and charles are contesting in an election and there are seven voters.so the maximum vote each contestant can get is seven.three bits are hence required for the representation of votes gained by each candidate and a total of nine bits for the representation of encoded votes corresponds to each candidate .",
    "@xmath74 + a sample voting scenario is given below where six voters made the vote out of seven .",
    ".example e - voting [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "security in online election is a challenging task.authenticating the voter is a major challenge along with the privacy of the vote.we have considered manual authentication and proposed a modification to the existing voting scheme which uses electronic voting machine.the voting machines are not reliable and also in certain situations where the number of candidates are more , more than one voting machine needs to be connected.the proposed scheme is cost effective and also reliable .",
    "it is noted that the proposed algorithm mentioned is simple and effective and provides privacy to the vote casted.the shares are generated by constructing a random polynomial and the share size is same as the encoded vote.the collection centers have no idea about how the votes are encoded , how many bits are used for encoding , which bits represents a particular candidate votes etc.the collection centres will receive a random value from the field @xmath64 from which no information about the secret vote can be obtained.the coalition of @xmath1 untrusted collection centers can obtain the result.but they does nt have any knowledge about the number of collection centres , the threshold used and also what is the @xmath68 values assigned to each collection centre.in the example we have considered 1,2 and 3 for simplicity , however different @xmath68 values can be used and is kept secret .",
    "shamir s secret sharing scheme is information theoretically secure.it is perfect in the sense that no information can be obtained from less than the threshold number of participants.this adds trust to the existing e - voting scheme , because the computation of the result need participation of @xmath1 centers.the computation of the shares and the reconstruction of the final result using the share sum can be done using polynomial evaluation and interpolation.efficient @xmath75 algorithms for polynomial evaluation and interpolation are mentioned in @xcite,@xcite.simple quadratic algorithms are sufficient because the number of shares generated is not too large .",
    "the encoding and decoding of the votes can also be done easily.the codes for each candidates and also the number of bits required to represent the votes depends on the number of voters and number of contesting candidate.these setups are done by the election officials prior to the election process.the decoding of votes is a simple binary conversion which can also be done easily .",
    "the integrity of the share sum maintained by each centre is achieved by implementing a digital signature scheme.this can also be efficiently implemented using any digital signature scheme @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is computationally efficient and the complexity involved depends on the share generation during the voting and the communication with the collection centres .the number of shares are usually small and hence the share generation using polynomial evaluation is simple.the secure communication between the voting terminal and the collection centre is a more challenging.separate communication module can be incorporated to do it efficiently.the collection centre must also be capable of handling requests from large number of voting terminals.region wise collection centres can be incorporated to balance the load and update the top level collection centre data in a periodic manner.the result analysis needs the polynomial interpolation but is done only once and it does nt add much complexity to the performance of the system .",
    "the e - voting scheme using shamir s secret sharing homeomorphism is a first proposal which helps to obtain not only the election result but also the votes gained by each candidate with encoding and decoding of votes in a typical manner.the proposal of secret sharing homomorphism was suggested by several authors , however true or false voting mechanism is mentioned.the proposed algorithm generalize the use of secret sharing homomorphism to e - voting which provides secrecy , computational efficiency , trust and reliability.the system does not also leave any trace of the vote made by a voter .",
    "the strong requirement of the scheme mentioned here is a secure channel for sending shares.the shares can be send through different channels to different collection centres.the intruder have to get access to @xmath1 different channels for breaking the security of the scheme.for additional security , the shares can also be encrypted by using the public keys of the collection centre.there are several homomorphic encryptions which support this or ordinary encryption decryption can be used .",
    "the system works efficiently for a moderate election with less number of voters .",
    "if the number of voters and candidates are more , the encoded vote will have a large value and the system has to chose a field of large size.this will large share size and too much communication overhead.this can be avoided by breaking the encoded vote into smaller code and makes shares of it.however the complexity involved in the implementation will increase .",
    "we have done a preliminary implementation of the scheme using java @xcite.additional modules are incorporated as per the requirement.another feature that can be incorporated is the implementation of digital signature scheme , which ensures integrity and authenticity of the shares.verifiable secret sharing techniques can also be incorporated which ensures the consistency of the shares , however it slow down the system performance .",
    "we are looking for a more sophisticated implementation guaranteeing authentication using mobile phones and otp(one time password ) for all the users using adhar details.instead of voting terminals every one can vote using the registered mobile which is our future plan .",
