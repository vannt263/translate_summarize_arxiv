    "in particular , the hausdorff dimension for the lqg metric is predicted to be @xmath72 the prediction in was widely believed . in a recent work @xcite , miller and sheffield introduced and studied a process called _ quantum loewner evolution_. as a _ byproduct _ of their work they gave a non - rigorous analysis on exponents of the lqg metric which matched watabiki s prediction  we also note that in @xcite the authors did express some reservations on their non - rigorous analysis . for other discussions on watabiki s prediction in mathematical literature , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the precise mathematical interpretation of watabiki s prediction is not completely clear to us .",
    "however , there are a number of reasonable `` folklore '' interpretations that seem to be widely accepted . for the liouville graph distance ,",

    "* conjecture 1.14 ) though the graph structure considered in @xcite is based on the peanosphere construction of lqg and so far we see no mathematical connection to liouville graph distance considered in the present article .",
    "note that there is a difference of factor of 2 , which is due to the fact that for the graph defined in @xcite on average each ball contains lqg measure about @xmath76 ( in their notation ) while in our construction each ball contains lqg measure @xmath77 .",
    "we see that theorem  [ thm : lqg ] contradicts .",
    "there are also reasonable interpretations of watabiki s prediction for liouville fpp .-",
    "lqg metric should involve @xmath78 , i.e. , the parameter in the exponential of gff is @xmath79 instead of @xmath80 . ] for instance , see ( * ? ? ? * equation ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) ) .",
    "we would like to point out that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 17 ) ) the term @xmath81 was not defined  some reasonable interpretations include @xmath82 and @xmath83 as well as possibly replacing @xmath80 by @xmath84 as suggested in the footnote .",
    "for all these interpretations , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 18 ) ) would then imply that there exist constants @xmath85 such that for sufficiently small but fixed @xmath11 the liouville fpp distance between two generic points is between @xmath86 and @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "however , theorem  [ thm : main ] contradicts with all aforementioned interpretations of for liouville fpp at high temperatures .",
    "currently , we do not have any reasonable conjecture on the precise value of the exponent for either liouville fpp or liouville graph distance  we regard a precise computation of the exponent for either of the two metrics as a major challenge .      combined with @xcite , theorem  [ thm - discrete ] shows that the weight exponent for first passage percolation on the exponential of log - correlated gaussian fields is non - universal , i.e. , the exponents may differ for different families of log - correlated gaussian fields .",
    "in contrast , we note that the behavior for the maximum is universal among log - correlated gaussian fields ( see e.g. , @xcite ) in a sense that their expectations are the same up to additive @xmath89 term and that the laws of the centered maxima for all these fields are in the same universal family known as gumbel distribution with random shifts ( but the random shifts may not have the same law for different fields ) .    while non - universality suggests subtlety for the weight exponent of liouville fpp , the proof in the present article does not see complication due to such subtlety .",
    "in fact , our proof should be adaptable to general log - correlated gaussian fields with @xmath90-scale invariant kernels as in @xcite .",
    "the following question remains an interesting challenge , especially ( in light of the non - universality ) for log - correlated gaussian fields for which a kernel representation is not known to exist .",
    "let @xmath91 be an arbitrary mean - zero gaussian field satisfying @xmath92 .",
    "does an analogue of theorem  [ thm - discrete ] hold for @xmath93 depending on @xmath94 ?",
    "much effort has been devoted to understanding classical first - passage percolation ( fpp ) , with independent and identically distributed edge / vertex weights .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and their references for reviews of the literature on this subject .",
    "we argue that fpp with strongly - correlated weights is also a rich and interesting subject , involving questions both analogous to and divergent from those asked in the classical case .",
    "since the gaussian free field is in some sense the canonical strongly - correlated random medium , we see strong motivation to study liouville fpp .    more specifically , as mentioned earlier liouville fpp and liouville graph distance play key roles in understanding the random metric associated with the liouville quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "we remark that the random metric of lqg is a major open problem , even just to make rigorous sense of it ( we refer to @xcite for a rather up - to - date review ) . in a recent series of works of miller and sheffield ,",
    "much understanding has been obtained for the lqg metric ( in the special case when @xmath95 ) , and we note that an essentially equivalent metric to liouville graph distance was mentioned in @xcite as a natural approximation . while no mathematical result was obtained ( perhaps not attempted either ) on such approximations , the main achievement of this series of works by miller and sheffield ( see @xcite and references therein ) is to produce candidate scaling limits and to establish a deep connection to the brownian map .",
    "our approach is different , in the sense that we aim to understand the random metric of lqg via approximations by natural discrete metrics .",
    "we also note that in a recent work @xcite some upper and lower bounds have been obtained for a type of distance related to lqg and that their bounds are consistent with watabiki s prediction .",
    "we further remark that currently we see no connection between our work and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we expect that liouville fpp metric and liouville graph distance are related to the heat kernel estimate for liouville brownian motion ( lbm )  in fact , we expect a direct and strong connection between liouville graph distance and the lbm heat kernel .",
    "the mathematical construction ( of the diffusion ) for lbm was provided in @xcite and the heat kernel was constructed in @xcite . the lbm is closely related to the geometry of lqg ; in @xcite the kpz formula was derived from liouville heat kernel . in @xcite some nontrivial bounds for lbm heat kernel were established .",
    "a very interesting direction is to compute the heat kernel of lbm with high precision .",
    "there has been a number of other recent works on liouville fpp ( while they focus on the case for the discrete gff , these results are expected to extend to the case of continuous gff ) . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that at high temperatures the appropriately normalized liouville fpp converges subsequentially in the gromov - hausdorff sense to a random metric on the unit square , where all the ( conjecturally unique ) limiting metrics are homeomorphic to the euclidean metric .",
    "we remark that the proof method in the current paper bears little similarity to that in @xcite . in a very recent work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the dimension of the geodesic for liouville fpp is strictly larger than 1 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it proved that all paths with dimension close to 1 has weight exponent close to 1 , which combined with theorem  [ thm - discrete ] yields that the lower bound on the dimension of the geodesic . while both the proofs in @xcite and the present article use multi - scale analysis method , the details are drastically different .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that there has been a few other recent works on the metric properties of two - dimensional discrete gff , including @xcite on the random pseudo - metric on a graph defined via the zero - set of the gaussian free field on its metric graph , @xcite on the chemical distance on the level sets of gff , and @xcite on the effective resistance metric on the random network where each edge @xmath96 is assigned a resistance @xmath97 . in particular , the work of @xcite implies that the typical effective resistance between two vertices of euclidean distance @xmath57 behaves like @xmath98 .",
    "combined with theorem  [ thm - discrete ] , this implies that ( somewhat mysteriously ) perturbing @xmath99 by assigning weights which are exponentials of gff drastically distorts the shortest path distance but more or less preserves the effective resistance of @xmath99 .",
    "our proof strategy naturally inherits that of @xcite which proved a weak version of theorem  [ thm - discrete ] in the context of brw , and we encourage the reader to flip through @xcite ( in particular section 1.2 ) which contains a prototype of the multi - scale analysis carried out in the current paper .",
    "in fact , prior to the present article , we posted an article @xcite on arxiv which proved that the weight exponent is less than @xmath100 .",
    "our present article proves a stronger result than @xcite .",
    "in addition , the proof simplifies that of @xcite and is self - contained . as a result",
    ", @xcite will be superseded by the present article and will not be published anywhere .    however , some historical remarks might be interesting and helpful . during the work of @xcite",
    ", we had in mind that the second leading term for the weight exponent is of order @xmath101 in light of . as a result",
    ", we followed @xcite and designed a strategy of constructing light crossings inductively to prove an upper bound of @xmath100 . in the multi - scale construction",
    ", the order of @xmath101 is exactly the order of both the gain and the loss for our strategy , and thus a much delicate analysis was carried out in @xcite since we fought between two constants for the loss and the gain .",
    "a curious reader may quickly flip through @xcite for an impression on the level of technicality .    a key component in both @xcite is an inductive construction where we construct light crossings in a bigger scale from crossings in smaller scale , where we will switch between two layers of candidate crossings in smaller scale the value of gaussian variables in the bigger scale (",
    "note that there is a hierarchical structure for both brw and gff ) . in those papers",
    ", we used vertical crossings as our switching gadgets to connect horizontal crossings in top and bottom layers . a crucial improvement in the current article arises from a simple observation that a _",
    "switching gadget is much more efficient ( see figure  [ fig : sloped_gadget ] ) .",
    "in order to give a flavor of how it works we discuss the following toy problem .",
    "+ let @xmath102 be a large positive number and @xmath103 be a continuous , centered gaussian field on the rectangle @xmath104 \\times [ 0 , 1]$ ] .",
    "suppose that the @xmath105 satisfies the following properties : + ( a ) @xmath106 for all @xmath107 .",
    "+ ( b ) for any straight line segment @xmath108 , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the ( euclidean ) length of @xmath108 . furthermore if @xmath111 is orthogonal to @xmath108 such that @xmath112 , then @xmath113 we want to construct a piecewise smooth path @xmath8 connecting the shorter boundaries of @xmath114 that has a small `` random length '' given by @xmath115 . due to condition ( a ) , we can approximate @xmath116 with @xmath117 when @xmath80 is sufficiently small .",
    "thus the random length of @xmath8 is approximately @xmath118 henceforth we will treat the above expression as the `` true '' random length of @xmath8 .",
    "now consider the segments @xmath119 \\times \\{0.75\\}$ ] and @xmath120 \\times \\{0.25\\}$ ] .",
    "choose @xmath121 such that @xmath122 and divide @xmath123 ( here @xmath124 $ ] ) into segments @xmath125 of length @xmath121 from left to right .",
    "given @xmath126 for each @xmath127 $ ] ( called a _ strategy _ ) , we can construct a crossing i.e. a path connecting the left and right boundaries of @xmath114 as follows . if @xmath128 , let @xmath129 be the segment @xmath130 .",
    "otherwise set @xmath129 as the segment joining the left endpoints of @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( the sloped gadget ) .",
    "it is clear that the segments @xmath133 define a crossing .",
    "the random length ( see ) of this crossing is given by @xmath134}\\mathbf 1_{\\{i_j \\neq i_{j + 1}\\}}(|\\mathcal l'_j| - \\beta ) + \\gamma \\sum_{j \\in [ \\gamma / \\beta]}\\int_{\\mathcal l'_j}\\zeta(z)|dz|\\,.\\ ] ] since @xmath135 , @xmath136 whenever @xmath137",
    ". on the other hand by condition ( b ) , @xmath138 is a centered gaussian variable with variance @xmath139 whenever @xmath137 and thus @xmath140 therefore if we choose our strategy so that @xmath137 only on a _ fixed _ set @xmath141 , then we can bound ( from above ) the expected random length of the crossing by @xmath142 here @xmath143 are positive constants and @xmath144 is the union of segments @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "now notice that @xmath147 as @xmath148 and @xmath149 are centered .",
    "but by condition ( b ) , @xmath150 is a centered gaussian variable with variance @xmath151 for some positive constant @xmath152 .",
    "thus if we allow @xmath153 to be only large enough so that @xmath154 and set @xmath155 or 2 accordingly as @xmath156 or @xmath157 , then @xmath158 and @xmath159 let us call the path given by this strategy as @xmath160 . plugging the previous two expressions into",
    ", we find that the expected random length of @xmath160 can be at most @xmath161 the above expression is minimized for @xmath162 and the optimal value is @xmath163 when @xmath80 is small .",
    "this shows , on a high level , why we get a contraction as in theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "we remark that the simple observation on the slopped switching strategy is more natural when considering continuous path in the plane  this is why our main proof focuses on the case of continuous gff . in the case for discrete gff , we first bound the distance minimizing the lengths over all continuous path and then argue that for each continuous path there is a lattice path whose weight grows by a factor that is negligible .",
    "we now give a brief guide on the organization . in section  [ sec - preliminary ] ,",
    "we introduce a new gaussian field which has a simpler hierarchical structure than the circle average process  our main proof will be carried out for this new field . in section  [ sec - construction ]",
    "we describe our inductive construction on light crossings as scales increase and in particular we introduce the aforementioned sloped switching gadget . in section  [ sec - analysis ]",
    "we analyze the construction in section  [ sec - construction ] and derive an upper bound on the weight exponent for the gaussian field from section  [ sec - preliminary ] . in section  [ sec - circle ] , we show that the circle average process of gff is well - approximated by the field from section  [ sec - preliminary ] , thereby proving theorem  [ thm : main ] . in section  [ sec : lqg ] , we prove theorem  [ thm : lqg ] by relating the liouville graph distance to liouville fpp and applying theorem  [ thm : main ] . finally , in section  [ sec - discrete ] we explain how to adapt the proof to deduce theorem  [ thm - discrete ] .",

    "there is a simple representation of @xmath820 as a sum of simple random walk probabilities .",

    "we write @xmath821 where @xmath822 is a lazy simple random walk on @xmath823 i.e. it stays put for each step with probability @xmath824 and jumps to each of its four neighbors with probability @xmath825 , @xmath826 is the measure corresponding to the random walk starting from @xmath18 and @xmath827 is the first time the random walk hits @xmath828 .",
    "emulating our approach to the approximation of circle average process with @xmath243 , we replace @xmath827 in the above representation with the order of it expectation i.e. @xmath829 ( on @xmath830 , of course ) and obtain a new kernel : @xmath831 notice that , thanks to the laziness of @xmath832 , each matrix @xmath833 is non - negative definite . the similarity between this expression and the integral representation of @xmath834 prompts the following decomposition of @xmath835 : @xmath836}\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{4^{k'-1 } \\leq k < 4^{k'}}{\\mathbb p}^v(s_k = w ) = \\sum_{k ' \\in [ n]}k_{n , k'}(v , w)\\,.\\ ] ] hence we can `` approximate '' @xmath837 with a sum of independent , stationary fields @xmath838 on @xmath56 where the covariance kernel of @xmath838 is `` given '' by @xmath839 . denote @xmath840 }",

    "it is immediate that the sequence of fields @xmath841 s are stationary and have independent increments . using standard results on discrete planar random walk and local central limit theorem estimates ( see , e.g. , chapters  2 and 4 in @xcite ) one can also prove the following properties :    a.   @xmath842 and @xmath843 for all @xmath74 . compare this",

    "we can now use strategies similar to those used for constructing @xmath319 . since the fields @xmath841 s do not have rotational invariance , we will actually construct crossings in all possible directions at any given scale and consider the _ maximum expected weight _ of these crossings . in view of properties  ( a ) and ( b ) , we can then obtain recursion relations like and on the maximum expected weight without any significant change in the analysis .",
    "next we create a ( lattice ) crossing @xmath849 of @xmath850 from the crossing @xmath851 which we constructed for @xmath114 so that @xmath852 we can do this by following the procedure detailed in the proof of lemma  [ lem : star_lfpp ] .",
    "indeed we have an analogous upper bound on @xmath853 for adjacent @xmath74 : @xmath854 which makes all the arguments employed in the proof of lemma  [ lem : star_lfpp ] work smoothly .",
    "the approximation of @xmath815 with @xmath855 can be dealt with in a similar way as we did in section  [ sec : main_thm ] . once we have bound on expected weights of crossings between shorter boundaries of rectangles at all scales",
