    "macroscopic mechanical systems are observed to obey classical mechanics to within experimental error .",
    "however , the atoms which ultimately make up these systems certainly obey quantum mechanics . therefore , the question of how the observed classical mechanics emerges from the underlying quantum mechanics arises immediately .",
    "this emergence , referred to as the quantum to classical transition , is particularly curious in the light of the fact that the equations of motion for the trajectories of classical mechanics are nonlinear , and can therefore exhibit chaos , whereas even a proper quantification of chaos in quantum mechanics has been difficult to obtain  @xcite .",
    "note that the task of explaining the quantum to classical transition ( the qct ) is essentially a practical question : it is a question of explaining why real systems , such as nonlinear pendulums , baseballs , and other systems which can be be built and observed in the laboratory obey classical mechanics ( at least to within any experimental error ) .",
    "it is not a question of obtaining classical mechanics precisely as a formal limit of quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , due to the absence of chaos in closed quantum systems  @xcite , and the non - commutativity of the twin limits @xmath0 ( the semi - classical limit ) and @xmath1 ( the long - time limit necessary to describe chaos ) efforts to extract classical chaos as a formal limit have been less than successful .    if one describes macroscopic objects sufficiently realistically using quantum mechanics , then it should be possible to predict the ( often chaotic ) trajectories of classical dynamics . in order to do this , it is important to realize that _ all _ real classical systems are subject to interaction with their environment .",
    "this interaction does at least two things .",
    "first , it subjects the system to noise and damping  @xcite ( as a consequence all real classical systems are subject to noise and damping  even if small ) , and second , the environment provides a means by which information about the system can be extracted ( effectively continuously if desired ) , providing a measurement of the system  @xcite .",
    "two levels of description have been used to discuss the qct .",
    "the first utilizes the decoherence resulting from tracing over the environment to suppress quantum interference @xcite : it is assumed that no dynamical information about the individual system has been extracted from its environment . in many circumstances",
    "this alone can lead to an effectively classical evolution of a phase space distribution function  @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "a more fine - grained description is achieved when the environment is taken to be a meter that is continuously monitored , leading to a ` quantum trajectory unraveling ' of the system density operator conditioned on the measurement record .",
    "if one averages over all possible measurement results , the description reverts to that at the level of phase space distributions .",
    "however , the fine - grained description which explicitly incorporates monitoring of the environment is required to understand the qct at the level of extracting classical trajectories from the quantum substrate .",
    "an example of an environment that naturally provides a measurement is that of the electromagnetic field which surrounds the system .",
    "monitoring this environment consists of focusing the light which is reflected from the system , allowing the motion to be observed .",
    "if the environment is not being monitored , then the evolution is simply given by averaging over all the possible motions of the system .",
    "classically this means an average over any uncertainty in the initial conditions , and over the noise realizations .",
    "however , in the absence of explicit observation ( monitoring the environment and recording the evolution ) it is impossible to obtain classical trajectories : the system must be described by an ever broadening probability ( or pseudo - probability ) distribution in phase space .",
    "this is an experimental truism , and therefore applies regardless of whether the system is being treated by a classical or quantum mechanical theory .",
    "since all classical systems are subject to environmental interactions , and since measurement is necessary to deduce the trajectories of classical motion , it may be expected that such environmental interaction , and the associated measurement process , will need to be included in a treatment that is adequate enough to predict the emergence of classical motion from quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , recent work by a number of authors has made it increasingly clear that this provides a natural explanation for the emergence of classical motion , and , therefore , a resolution of the problem of the emergence of classical chaos  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the quantum theory of environments and continuous measurement is now sufficiently well developed that their effects can be treated in a fairly straightforward manner , the emergence of classical dynamics verified , and the mechanism of the quantum to classical transition elucidated .",
    "detailed studies of the qct are particularly timely because current experiments in quantum and atomic optics and condensed matter physics are beginning to probe this transition directly in both ensemble and individual system cases  @xcite .",
    "our approach here is to present a general formalism for understanding the transition : more focused analyses appropriate to specific experimental situations can easily be developed based on this general approach .    in",
    "the following we examine the qct in some detail . in section  [ macobj ] ,",
    "we examine how macroscopic systems may be treated , including environmental interactions and measurement . in section  [ ineq ]",
    ", we derive inequalities that describe the regime under which classical motion emerges . in section  [ classest ] , we show that , in addition , classical state - estimation will work in the classical limit . in section  [ numeg ] , we provide two specific numerical examples showing that classical motion is indeed obtained in the regime predicted in section  [ ineq ] .",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks in section  [ conc ] .",
    "a macroscopic object is composed of a very large number of quantum degrees of freedom . for example , we can consider the motions of the atoms which comprise a massive object , and these are all coupled together by the inter - atomic forces .",
    "the equations of classical mechanics are supposed to describe the dynamics of macroscopic quantities , such as the center of mass ; classical motion is not observed in the entire many particle phase space .",
    "hence , one should consider a change of variables , so as to write a hamiltonian in terms of the center - of - mass coordinate , @xmath2 ( with conjugate momentum @xmath3 ) .",
    "this coordinate is coupled to all the other coordinates @xmath4 ( in a solid we might refer to these as the internal phonon modes , for example ) . under the assumption that none of these environmental modes is strongly perturbed by the dynamics , it is sufficient to treat them as harmonic oscillators , and to couple them to the center - of - mass motion via the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath5\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 are the momenta of the internal modes , and @xmath7 gives the strength of the coupling between the center of mass and the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the center of mass now constitutes effectively an open system interacting with an environment consisting of a large number of harmonic oscillators with a correspondingly large range of frequencies .",
    "this is the starting point for a treatment of quantum brownian motion , as developed by caldeira and leggett  @xcite . under general conditions ,",
    "the phonon environment can be treated as a heat bath , and in the double limit of weak coupling to this bath and high temperature , it is possible to write a very simple master equation for the center - of - mass motion  @xcite : @xmath8 -                  k_{env } [ x,[x,\\rho]]\\ , , \\label{nomeas}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is determined by the @xmath7 and the temperature .",
    "this provides a simple description of the effects of the internal degrees of freedom upon the macroscopic motion of an object for which frictional effects are negligible , and the heating due to the noise is not significant over time scales of interest .",
    "if one wanted to treat damped classical systems , then one would relax the weak coupling approximation so as to give a master equation that explicitly contains damping .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will restrict our attention here to classical hamiltonian systems .",
    "another important environment which we need to consider is the quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "this interacts with the object , and provides a natural mechanism for measurement of the center - of - mass position @xmath2 .",
    "in general , macroscopic objects are bathed in light from all directions , and the light that is reflected may be monitored by a large number of observers . since we are considering a one - dimensional system , and since we wish to use the simplest description which captures the essential aspects of the measurement process , we restrict ourselves to interaction with an electromagnetic field in one dimension .",
    "in particular , we consider a laser reflected from the object such that the phase shift provides information about @xmath2 .",
    "performing an analysis of such a measurement , one finds that the evolution of the system , conditioned upon the measurement record , may be written as a stochastic master equation in the it formalism  @xcite as  @xcite @xmath10 + k                 ( [ x^\\dag x,\\rho]_+ - 2 x \\rho x^\\dag ) \\ } dt \\nonumber\\\\         & & + \\frac{\\sqrt{{\\bar k}}}2 \\ { ( x\\rho + \\rho x^\\dag ) - \\rho \\mathop{\\rm tr }       \\rho ( x + x^\\dag ) \\ }        dw \\nonumber\\\\        & = & - \\ { \\frac{i}{\\hbar } [ h_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize cm}}(x , p),\\rho ] + k             [ x , [ x , \\rho ] ] \\ } dt \\nonumber\\\\        & & + \\frac{\\sqrt{{\\bar k}}}2 \\ { [ x,\\rho]_+ - 2 \\rho \\mathop{\\rm tr } \\rho x \\ }          dw \\",
    ", , \\label{sme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the observed measurement record is given by @xmath11 in these equations , @xmath12 is a white noise generating a wiener process , @xmath13 gives the strength of the interaction between the light and the object and is proportional to the power of the laser , whereas @xmath14 gives the rate at which information about the system is obtained .",
    "when no information is obtained ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath15 ) , or if the measurement record is averaged over , the stochastic master equation ( [ sme ] ) reduces to the ordinary master equation ( [ nomeas ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath16 , called the efficiency of the measurement  @xcite , is a measure of the fraction of the reflected light that is actually detected by the observer in making the measurement .",
    "as will be clear from our discussion in sec .",
    "[ ineq ] , though both @xmath13 and @xmath14 arise from the interaction of the system with the measurement environment , they play very different roles : whereas @xmath17 represents a noise on the system that leads to spreading out in phase space , @xmath14 provides information about the system leading to localization around individual trajectories . the fact that eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ) leads to a ( completely ) positive evolution for all initial conditions if and only if @xmath18  @xcite is a particular case of the general information - disturbance principles in quantum mechanics : any process that leads to information about a system must produce at least a minimal unavoidable disturbance .",
    "if there exist multiple observers dividing the available reflected light up among them , then each sees an evolution with a value of @xmath19 ( and , for positivity , @xmath20 ) , with a different noise realization for each observer  @xcite .",
    "this is certainly the case in reality , where each observer usually captures only a small fraction of the available light . in the regime in which classical motion is obtained ( which we will refer to as the _ classical limit _ ) , all observers must agree on the motion of the system to within experimental error , and we consider this question at the end of the next section , and in our numerical examples .",
    "since the form of the equation resulting from interaction with the internal modes is the same as that which results from failing to monitor the light which is being used to probe the system , we can take this environment into account in the same way that we take multiple observers into account , that is , by taking an appropriate value of @xmath21 .",
    "( the measurement constant @xmath13 is then adjusted to include the contribution from @xmath9 ) .",
    "the stochastic master equation  ( [ sme ] ) constitutes our description of the evolution of the center - of - mass of a macroscopic object . in the following",
    "we will show that this description , while very simple , is sufficiently realistic to obtain the correct classical motion in the classical limit .",
    "it should also be noted that while we have chosen to measure the position @xmath2 , the analysis which follows suggests that the extraction of the classical limit is not sensitive to the precise observables which are measured ; as long as the measurement provides sufficient information about the location of the system in phase space , the classical limit will be obtained . for example , a continuous measurement of momentum will suffice , as long as the forces on the system are spatially dependent .",
    "in fact , other authors have provided numerical support for this view by showing that quantum state diffusion ( using a measurement interaction which includes damping )  @xcite or a simultaneous measurement of position and momentum  @xcite are sufficient to induce the qct in the same manner .",
    "if the correct classical mechanics is to be obtained , two conditions need to be satisfied .",
    "first , it must be possible to observe the system so that its center of mass ( and all other degrees of freedom considered classical ) is known sufficiently accurately on the scale of the potential and relevant dynamical timescales .",
    "second , these observed values , which we might identify as noisy counterparts of the means of the sufficiently well localized distribution , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , should evolve according to the classical hamiltonian @xmath24 which has the same functional form as the quantum hamiltonian @xmath25 , with deviations small compared to the classical scales .",
    "in other words , the existence of the quantum to classical transition implies that in the classical limit we can replace the quantum operators with effective classical dynamical variables , @xmath26",
    "we now ask for the parameter regime in which the evolution reduces to classical motion .",
    "as explained in the previous section this means that the quantum distribution remains sufficiently localized ( such that the system can be said to be executing a trajectory ) , and that this trajectory , characterized by @xmath27 and @xmath23 , follows that of the classical motion , generated by @xmath24 .",
    "we proceed by first writing down the equations of motion for the first and second moments of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . from eq .",

    "it is the task of the measurement to maintain such localization , and numerical studies  @xcite have shown that it can indeed do so .    at this point , it is perhaps instructive to look at the origin of localization of the individual trajectories . the density matrix obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ) is conditioned on the measurement record eq .",
    "( [ measrec ] ) , or equivalently , by the noise realization @xmath12 .",
    "averaging over these realizations results in the density matrix of the unobserved system which can also be obtained by solving eq .",

    "the wiener process damps the first term on the right hand side of each equation by a term proportional to @xmath49 , at the same time compensating this with a growth of the last term in each equation . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ classest ] , this is precisely the way in which classical measurement also selects well defined trajectories out of an ensemble spreading out in phase space .    at the level of these second cumulants , the exact form of the damping is ,",
    "thus , immaterial .",
    "the fact , however , that we derived these from the stochastic master equation  ( [ sme ] ) gives us not only a theoretical ` unraveling ' of the master equation , but also provides a physical meaning to each trajectory .",
    "furthermore , it guarantees that the underlying evolutions of density functions are completely positive , and , therefore , not only does the covariance matrix stay positive , but also these equations can be completed into a hierarchy of cumulant equations that automatically satisfy the appropriate reality conditions .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in sec .",

    "( [ c2 ] ) ; in contrast , in the classical discussion in sec .  [ classest ] , the corresponding noise term is unrelated to the measurement process and can even be set to zero .",
    "in fact , the truncation to the second cumulants implies that no truly quantum effects of dynamics come into play  @xcite in our approximation , and the quantum scale @xmath51 appears in our equations purely from this information - disturbance consideration  @xcite .",
    "we will make two self consistent approximations in order to examine in what regime classical dynamics emerges .",
    "the first is to truncate the power series in @xmath35 to second order .",
    "the second is to neglect third and higher cumulants in the equations for the second cumulants .",

    "is taken to be evaluated at a typical point in phase space .",
    "now , there are three conditions that must be satisfied in order for the classical limit to be obtained .",
    "first , localization such that @xmath56 , as discussed above , must be maintained , second , the noise introduced by the measurement should be negligible compared to the classical motion , and third , that the measurement record should follow the motion of the position with sufficient accuracy .    before examining these conditions in turn , two points",
    "are in order .",
    "first , localization and low noise are not really independent constraints : in fact to provide effective damping for the covariance matrix , the noise has to increase with increasing width of the state .",
    "conversely , noise also effects a spread in phase space of any uncertain state , especially near unstable points .",
    "it is convenient , however , to treat the direct effect of the finite width of the state on the deterministic evolution in a nonlinear potential as a question of localization , and the rest as a question of low noise on the trajectories .    as a second point",
    ", it is important to emphasize that the deviations of the quantum trajectories from the classical ones can be different in different parts of the phase space . nevertheless , in most experimental situations",
    ", ` classical ' quantities evaluated are of similar orders of magnitude almost everywhere , and , so , we shall ignore these differences and consider them evaluated at a ` typical ' point around the trajectory in question .",
    "we start by noting that for the deterministic part of the equations of motion for the quantum mean values @xmath39 and @xmath40 to match the classical equations of motion , we need @xmath57 to very closely approximate @xmath58 . that is , we need @xmath59 replacing @xmath60 with its typical steady state value [ eqs .",

    "( [ locineq1 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ ineq14 ] ) is stronger than eq .",
    "( [ ineq13 ] ) , we can summarize these results as follows : if the nonlinearity , characterized by @xmath70 , is sufficiently weak to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ locineq1 ] ) , then , at the unstable points ( @xmath71 ) one needs @xmath72 in the case of strong nonlinearity , we need @xmath73 to hold at all points .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the noise component of these equations . in the classical limit",
    "the effect of this noise must be negligible on the scale of the deterministic dynamics . to compare the random noise with the deterministic dynamics , we need to average over an appropriate time scale : during a time @xmath74 upon which",
    "the dynamics is effectively linear , the noise @xmath12 provides an _ rms _ contribution of @xmath75 .",
    "we will define ` low noise ' to mean that the noise contribution on this time scale is small compared to the deterministic contribution .",
    "the time scales upon which the dynamics is linear for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are those in which the terms in the respective equations do not change appreciably , and we will use the deterministic terms to obtain these time scales .",
    "the deterministic motion for @xmath39 is driven by @xmath76 , so appreciable changes occur when the change in momentum , @xmath77 , is of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting time scale for this change is @xmath78 .",
    "the deterministic motion for @xmath40 is driven by @xmath79 .",
    "changes in @xmath35 are due to changes in @xmath39 : in particular @xmath80 .",
    "hence the time scale for changes in @xmath35 is @xmath81 . demanding that the change in @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the noise is small compared to that due to the deterministic motion in these time intervals gives the two inequalities @xmath82 we will now examine these two inequalities in turn .",

    "we obtain @xmath94 where for compactness we have written @xmath95 here @xmath96 is a dimensionless quantity , which we will once again take to be an estimate of the typical action of the system in units of @xmath51 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the condition @xmath97 is satisfied whenever @xmath98 whereas , for @xmath99 ( the condition is not useful when @xmath100 ) , it is sufficient that @xmath101 collecting all the inequalities in this subsection , ( _ i.e. _ eqs .  ( [ ineq6 ] ) , ( [ ineq3 ] ) , ( [ ineq8 ] ) , ( [ ineq9 ] ) and ( [ ineq10 ] ) ) , we find that they are all implied by @xmath102 where @xmath103 .      in the previous subsections we have been considering the motion of the centroid of the quantum wave packet , @xmath104 .",
    "this centroid represents the observer s true best - estimate of the mean value of position and momentum at the current time , given the measurement record . to obtain this best estimate",
    "the observer must know the dynamics of the system , given by @xmath105 , and then integrate the full stochastic master equation , where the correct @xmath12 is obtained continuously from the measurement record .    in practice , it is often merely the measured value of position which is taken as the estimated value .",
    "hence , we need to find conditions under which this value tracks the true best - estimate with sufficient accuracy . since the measurement record in our formulation contains white noise , the simplest way to model a realistic macroscopic measuring apparatus is to low - pass filter , or _",
    "band limit _ the measurement record to obtain the continuous estimate of the position ( this is equivalent to making the reasonable assumption that all real measuring devices have a finite response time ) .",
    "this is achieved by averaging the measurement record over some finite time @xmath106 . to obtain an accurate estimate ,",
    "@xmath106 must be short compared to the dynamical time scale of the system .",
    "if we assume that the change in @xmath39 over time @xmath106 is negligible , then the error in the estimate of @xmath39 resulting from averaging the measurement record @xmath107 over @xmath106 is @xmath108 hence , if to accurately track a classical dynamical system we require a spatial resolution of @xmath109 , and a temporal resolution of @xmath106 , then we must have @xmath110 we also note , however , that in the observation of classical systems , classical estimation theory is , in fact , often used to obtain the classical equivalent of the quantum best - estimates provided by the sme ( eq .  ( [ sme ] ) ) .",
    "such a procedure is most often used in classical feedback - control applications . in the classical limit ,",
    "therefore , such classical estimation procedures must work effectively , and we will verify this in the next section .",
    "we have now derived a set of inequalities which , when satisfied , lead to the emergence of classical mechanics .",
    "consider first the inequalities which come from the localization condition . in the macroscopic regime , which applies to common mechanical devices one would build in the laboratory , the right hand side of inequality ( [ locineq1 ] )",
    "is extremely large compared to the typical nonlinearity .",
    "consequently this inequality is satisfied , and the resulting condition for @xmath13 is given by ( [ locineq2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath51 does not appear in this inequality .",
    "in fact , this is actually a classical inequality , similarly required for classical continuous measurement on classical systems . in that case ,",
    "the observer s state of knowledge of the system is given by a classical probability density in phase space , and this evolves as the system evolves and as information is continuously obtained .    if the system is sufficiently small , and the nonlinearity sufficiently large on the quantum scale so that inequality ( [ locineq1 ] ) is not satisfied , then the condition for @xmath13 is replaced by inequality ( [ locineq3 ] ) .",
    "this does contain @xmath51 , and is , therefore , a uniquely quantum condition .",
    "it appears due to the unavoidable quantum noise which affects the dynamics strongly if the nonlinearity is large on the quantum scale .",
    "the left inequality in eq .  ( [ lnineq ] ) , again is a classical condition ( the @xmath51 arises because we chose to measure the action @xmath111 in units of @xmath51 ) : it reflects the observation that if the measurement does not localize the motion , the state estimate changes from moment to moment essentially randomly , or in other words , the noise is large . the right hand inequality in eq .",
    "( [ lnineq ] ) is the direct effect of the irreducible noise coming from the measurement process and is thus a quantum effect .",
    "together , as the action increases , these low noise conditions put ever decreasing constraints on the required measurement strength .",
    "the faithful tracking condition is once again purely classical , in that it also applies to classical observation .",
    "it is simply the condition on the accuracy of the measurement so that the measurement record itself , as opposed to the estimated state , accurately tracks the motion of the system from which the localization condition is derived .",
    "it is worth noting that the above inequalities also determine the regime in which multiple observers agree on the motion of an object , which is clearly an important property of the classical limit . as discussed in section  [ macobj ] ,",
