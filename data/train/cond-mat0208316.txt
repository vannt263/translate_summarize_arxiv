    "ktao@xmath0 ( kt ) is one of the rare perovskite - type materials that remains cubic down to zero kelvin .",
    "it is also interesting because it is a quantum paraelectric and , therefore , its ferroelectric phase transition at low temperatures is suppressed by zero - point quantum vibrations .",
    "knbo@xmath0 ( kn ) is ferroelectric even at room temperature and exhibits a series of ferroelectric phase transitions with decreasing temperature .",
    "a variety of interesting phenomena occur when kt or / and kn form solid solutions via isovalent substitution of a or b cations ; [ k@xmath4li@xmath5tao@xmath0 ( klt ) and k[ta@xmath1,nb@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ktn ) are solid solutions which exhibit both order - disorder and soft - mode characteristics . in this work ,",
    "we use first - principles supercell calculations to investigate lattice dynamics , ground - state structures , and dynamical effective charges in klt and ktn .",
    "recent developments in quantum theory of polarization ( see the review in @xcite ) allow one to make first - principle ( fp ) computations of polarization and its derivative , dynamical charge .",
    "such computations show that dynamical charges are anomalously large in ferroelectric perovskite - type crystals ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and this has a significant effect on the soft - mode behaviors of these materials .",
    "variations of dynamical charges as functions of local chemical coordination , as occurs in solid solutions , have not been extensively studied .",
    "we present systematic results on the dynamical charges as functions of chemical configurations in ktn .",
    "the same tendencies were found for pmn supercells .",
    "we use the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite , which treats electronic structure within the framework of density function theory .",
    "detailed computations were performed for 40 ion supercells and a limited number of computations were done for an 80 ion supercell .",
    "the basis vectors were [ 002 ] , [ 020 ] and [ 200 ] for the 40 atom cell ( klt40 ) , and [ 220 ] , [ 022 ] and [ 202 ] for the 80 atom cell .",
    "the k - vector mesh was constructed from 4x4x4 monkhorst - pack grid .",
    "verification of this computational scheme was performed for pure ktao@xmath3 ; the self - consistent lattice constant @xmath6 = 3.96    agrees with previous lda and gga computations @xcite . the calculated lattice constant is smaller than the experimental value @xmath6 = 3.983    @xcite .",
    "vasp computes interatomic forces and total energies for crystals , and allows global relaxation as well as constrained relaxation of chosen internal coordinates and/or lattice parameters .",
    "we used frozen - phonon methods to obtain force constants for computing lattice dynamics . to compute dynamical charges",
    ", we used berry phase analyses as implemented in the vasp code by martijn marsman .",
    "we calculated the force constants matrix in klt40 containing one li per cell .",
    "the reference structure for the force constant calculations was obtained by first placing all ions on ideal perovskite positions and then optimizing lattice parameters and internal coordinates while maintaining full cubic symmetry .",
    "the resultant cell had @xmath7  .    from the force constants",
    ", we obtained the dynamical matrix , and the normal mode frequencies and eigenvectors .",
    "symmetry analysis of klt40 shows 14 @xmath8 triplets , one which is acoustic and 13 which represent polar transverse optical ( to ) modes . in table",
    "[ kltphon.tbl ] , we give the to normal mode frequencies .",
    ".computed to normal mode frequencies @xmath9 ( in @xmath10 ) for cubic k@xmath11lita@xmath12o@xmath13 ( klt ) . also shown are relative amplitudes of each mode in the fully relaxed tetragonal klt structure @xmath14 and relative contributions of each mode to the tetragonal phase polarization @xmath15 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ kltphon.tbl ]    for comparison , we also calculated the force constants of a 40-atom cell of pure kt at the same lattice parameter .",
    "the to normal mode results are shown in table  [ ktphon.tbl ] .",
    "the force constants in the two cases are nearly identical .",
    "the only interatomic force constants which change by more than 0.41 ev / @xmath16 are those involving the 12 o ions nearest the li site , and which favor li moving against its nearest neighor o sites .",
    "in fact , the one lattice instability found in klt is essentially li motion ( 85% of the dynamical matrix eigenvector ) opposite its nearest neighbor o ( 12% of the dynamical matrix eigenvector ) . because klt40 and kt have such similar force constant matrices , it is not surprising that the normal mode spectra are very similar : note that each lo mode in kt has a corresponding klt40 mode with very similar frequency .",
    "thus , the fp results confirm a picture of klt in which li are displaced off - center .",
    "we emphasize , however , that a quantitative description of the energetics and dynamics of klt requires that one also take into account the coordinated motion of the ions surrounding the li .",

    "our results thus support a picture of klt in which each li is displaced in one of the 6 [ 001]-type directions .",
    "we performed a full ionic relaxation of klt , polarized along @xmath21 .",
    "a breakdown of the displacement pattern into normal mode coordinates is shown in table  [ kltphon.tbl ] .",
    "although there is some mixture of higher frequency modes due to anharmonic coupling , the displacement pattern is dominated by the eigenvector of the lattice instability .",
    "a more interesting picture emerges when we investigate the contribution of each mode to the polarization of the relaxed structure .",
    "because the 121 @xmath10 mode corresponding to the soft mode of pure kt has such a large mode effective charge , it contributes 23% of the total polarization of klt40 .",
    "we investigated li energy as a function of displacement direction and found that the smallest barrier between [ 001 ] wells are saddle points in the [ 110 ] directions .",
    "1 shows the energy as a function of li displacement @xmath22   in the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] directions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the barrier energy is comparable with the thermal energy , li can jump between neighboring [ 0,0,@xmath23 wells via [ 110 ] saddle points .",
    "if all ions except for the li are fixed , the li displacements and potential barriers are very small relative those deduced experimentally ( by fitting a mean field expansion to experimental data @xcite ) ( upper curves in fig . 1 , see also @xcite ) . however , fully relaxed calculations ( lower curves in fig .",
    "1 ) yield good agreement : the equilibrium li displacement is [ 0,0,0.99  ] with @xmath6 = 3.96    and [ 0,0,1.07  ] with @xmath6 = 4.0  ; the corresponding adiabatic potential barriers are @xmath24103 mev ( 1190 k ) and @xmath24117 mev ( 1360 k ) , respectively .",
    "the calculated values are somewhat larger than the experimentally estimated barrier of 86 mev ( 998 k ) @xcite , but they agree rather well with the 1200 k barrier reported by @xcite . computed barrier heights may be systematically larger than fitted values if the latter are reduced by li - tunneling between neighboring wells over excited states .",
    "for the 80 atom supercell we obtained the li displacement 1.01    and the energy barrier @xmath25118 mev ( 1369 k ) , which is also somewhat larger than the experimental value of 86 mev ( 998 k ) @xcite .    fig .",
    "1(b ) represents our computations of li potential relief along a vector connecting neighboring li - wells , e.g. [ 0,0,d ] and [ 0,d,0 ] via a minimum energy [ 011 ] saddle .",
    "we computed the  frozen coordinate \" ( _ i.e _ all ions frozen except for li ) energies , as well as the adiabatic energies ( _ i.e _ with relaxed coordinates of the non - li ions ) .",
    "clearly , ionic relaxation promotes li - hopping by reducing potential barriers .    in a relaxed supercell",
    ", cations displace in the same direction as li , and anions displace in the opposite direction .",
    "this result supports the idea of coupling between li displacements and ferroelectrically active optical host ion modes @xcite .",
    "the largest local deformation is exhibited by the four oxygens that are closest to li .",
    "for example , in the 80 atom cell where the li - displacement is [ 0,0,1.01  ] , their displacements are [ 0,-0.074 ,-0.074  ] .",
    "in the 40 ion supercell these displacements are similar , [ 0,-0.093 ,-0.093  ] .",
    "such distortion was proposed @xcite to explain experimental data on the temperature dependence of photocurrent in [ k@xmath1,li@xmath2tao@xmath3   solid solutions .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with computations for litao@xmath3   and linbo@xmath3   @xcite , which also indicated a large oxygen displacements similar to those in our calculations .",
    "these oxygen displacments were explained in terms of a reduction in elastic energy that occurs because oxygens prefer to rotate about b site cations rather than directly approaching them @xcite .    based on the fact that li hop over a saddle point , we derived the following expression describing the temperature dependence of the relaxation time :    @xmath26    where : @xmath27   is the relaxation time ; @xmath28   is the boltzmann constant ; @xmath6   is a constant .",
    "the temperature dependence of the prefactor is a consequence of the existense of different paths when li overcomes the potential barrier .",
    "the temperature dependence of the average barrier , @xmath29 , is governed by the dynamics of the ions surrounding a li .",
    "this dependence can be understood if one introduces spatial and thermal potential barrier fluctuations    @xmath30    from comparison of the left and right sides of this equality one finds @xmath31 . at high temperature",
    "the potential barrier decreases linearly with temperature because of thermal fluctuations ( in excellent agreement with experiments performed for [ k@xmath32,li@xmath33tao@xmath3 @xcite ) . at low temperatures the barrier height decreases because of spatial fluctuations .",
    "also , critical slowing down of relaxation is common , at low temperature , but in klt , li - tunneling is a competitive process @xcite .",
    "we also performed computations for 80 atom supercells with li - li pairs ( fig .",
    "[ li2 ] ) .",
    "a li - li pair was introduced into an 80-ion supercell such that nn a - sites ( separation vector @xmath34 ) were occupied by li .",
    "we considered the following li - displacement configurations for this pair : @xmath35 , @xmath36   and @xmath37 .",
    "the energy required to convert a @xmath35   to @xmath37   configuration is 0.27 ev ( 2990 k ) in excellent agreement with the reported barrier height of 2800 k @xcite , attributed to the rearrangement of li pairs @xcite .",
    "significantly , the excitation energy required to move li pairs into the @xmath36   configuration , 0.26 ev , is close to the energy required to excite the @xmath37 configuration .",
    "this occurs because of the indirect dipole - dipole interaction between li ions in li - li pairs over the kt - like soft mode .",
    "the computed dynamical charge of li in ktao@xmath3:li is 1.2 e at the equilibrium position but it becomes lower than 1.0 at small li displacements .",
    "the dynamical charges of ta ( @xmath38 ) and nb ( @xmath39 ) , in pure kt and kn , respectively , were calculated as functions of [ 001 ] displacement in cubic structures with @xmath6 = 4.015  , using a 6x6x6 monkhorst - pack k - point grid .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pot ] .",
    "we also computed electrostatic potentials on the ions and their derivatives .",
    "displacement induced reductions in the second derivative of the potential were consistent with changes in @xmath38   and @xmath39 .",
    "indeed one can write a general relation : @xmath40   where @xmath41   and @xmath42   is a high frequency dielectric constant .",
    "hence the reduction in local field ( and charge - transfer @xcite ) that is caused by ionic displacement is responsible for the calculated decrease in dynamical charge .",
    "note that this decrease is rather large : e.g. for nb in kn @xmath39 = 9.8 at u=0 ; 8.5 at u=0.1  ; and 6.8 at u=0.2  .",
    "results of @xmath43   computations for ktn supercells are listed in table 3 and some results for [ 001 ] ordered supercells are shown in fig .",
    "4 . calculations for different [ hkl ] ordered superstructures , ( where [ hkl ] indicates an ordered sequence of layers perpendicular to the [ hkl ] vector )",
    "were all done with an 8x8x8 monkhorst - pack grid .",
    "all computations were performed for the _ cubic structure _ with the fixed lattice parameter @xmath44  .",
