    "the general theory of fluid mechanics begins in 1741 with the work of leonhard euler who was invited by frederick the great to construct an intrinsic system of water fountains .",
    "euler began with deducing the equations which are now called euler equations ; they describe the ideal ( inviscid ) liquid and are derived from the classical newton s conservation laws written for a fluid particle .",
    "euler equations , regarded with various boundary conditions and specific values of some parameters describe enormous number of wave systems , for instance , capillary waves , surface water waves , atmospheric planetary waves , drift waves in plasma , tsunami , freak waves , etc .",
    "the general form of reduced euler equations suitable for studying one specific type of waves can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are linear and nonlinear operators correspondingly , and @xmath5 is a small parameter chosen according to the properties of the wave system under consideration .",
    "for instance , it can be taken as a ratio of wave amplitude to its length , or as a ratio of a particle velocity to the phase velocity , or some other way .",
    "a linear wave is then a solution of the corresponding linear equation @xmath6 and has standard form @xmath7 } $ ] with amplitude @xmath8 , wave vector @xmath9 and dispersion function @xmath10 .",
    "the form of dispersion function is defined then by boundary conditions .",
    "the existence of a small parameter @xmath5 allows to reduce the study of all nonlinear waves to those which are resonantly interacting , that is , satisfy resonant conditions @xmath11 notice that amplitudes of resonantly interacting waves are not constant any more and standard multi - scale method yields the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) on these amplitudes .",
    "the energetic behavior of a wave system depends drastically on whether wave vectors @xmath12 have real or integer coordinates .",
    "the first case ( real - valued coordinates ) is treated in the frame of statistical wave turbulence ( swt ) theory @xcite , with additional assumption that @xmath13 is an algebraic number of degree @xmath14 .",
    "the energy transport in these systems is covered by the wave kinetic equation . the second case ( integer - valued coordinates )",
    "is described by discrete wave turbulence ( dwt ) theory @xcite , and energy transport is presented by a few quasi - periodic processes .",
    "model of laminated turbulence@xcite presents swt and dwt as two layers of a wave system , with elaborate transition from one layer to another .",
    "one of the novel problems emerging from this model is the necessity to solve ( [ open ] ) for very big integers .",
    "+ in the first two articles@xcite,@xcite of this series we presented algorithms for finding resonant wave interactions for _ irrational _ dispersion functions , with two illustrative examples : ( 1 ) gravitational water waves , @xmath15{m^2+n^2}$ ] ( 4-wave interactions ) ; and ( 2 ) ocean planetary waves , @xmath16 ( 3-wave interactions ) .",
    "the key points of the presentation were , first , that our algorithms for these cases differ only in some details and their core is applicable to a wide class of dispersion functions , thus justifying the name of `` generic '' .",
    "second , irrational equations in integers were solved without use of floating - point arithmetic and not even resolving the irrationalities involved .",
    "this gave us an enormous gain both in performance time and orders of numbers used .",
    "+ in the present paper we construct a special algorithm for solving ( [ open ] ) in case of a _ rational _ dispersion function .",
    "notice that for any rational dispersion function , @xmath17 is obviously a rational number , that is , an algebraic number of degree 1 .",
    "it makes swt theory not applicative for these type of wave systems because statistical layer of turbulence _ does not exists _ and the whole energetic behavior is covered by the discrete layer only .",
    "this makes the creation of some fast algorithm for computing integer solutions of ( [ open ] ) for the case of rational dispersion function of high importance .",
    "obviously , any equation in rational functions in integers can be trivially transformed into a diophantine equation .",
    "for[ratfun ] _ i=0 the corresponding diophantine equation will be [ diafun ] _",
    "i(p_i_jq_j)=0 jiwhich , however , leads to huge powers and extensive search .",
    "the idea underlying our algorithm is quite simple and we illustrate it by the example below .    [ [ example ] ]",
    "example + + + + + + +    suppose we need solve in integers an equation [ ratfunex]a = b , 0<a a_0 , 0<b b_0 where p / q is an irreducible fraction",
    ". we could transform it into @xmath18 and perform exhaustive search in the region @xmath19 with computational complexity @xmath20 .    however , we notice that the number @xmath21 is integer only if @xmath22 is a multiple of the denominator @xmath23",
    ". then @xmath24 is a solution only if @xmath25 with integer @xmath26 .",
    "which immediately gives @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a solution for any @xmath29 and these are all the solutions of the equation . notice that there is no search at all involved .    to show the power of the approach outlined above in practice , we proceed further with the example of spherical planetary waves .",

    "( [ prosetdef1 ] ) in a finite domain @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 . in our numerical experiments we operated with @xmath40 further called the main domain .",
    "the straightforward approach would be to multiply the first equation of sys .",
    "( [ prosetdef1 ] ) with all three denominators @xmath41 , substitute @xmath42 with @xmath43 and perform full search on @xmath44 .",
    "this evidently implies @xmath45 computation time and operating with numbers of the order of @xmath45 . for the main domain @xmath40",
    "this is halfway feasible with a large computer but clearly not for everyday use with a usual pc .",
    "moreover , computation time _ and _ order of numbers used grow rapidly with the domain , so when need for computations in larger domains arises , as it surely will , the algorithm will fail .",
    "+ we are going to present a far more efficient algorithm .",
    "* step 1 : search on @xmath46 + the search on @xmath47 is organized conventionally . without loss of generality ,",

    "notice that @xmath49 always lies between @xmath50 and @xmath51 and > from the two `` triangle inequalities '' of sys .",
    "( [ prosetdef1 ] ) the second one always holds , while the first one implies @xmath52 which limits the search on @xmath49 if @xmath53 .",
    "the oddity condition allows us to run the cycle on @xmath49 in steps of 2 .",
    "+ up to now , the computational complexity is @xmath54 . + * step 2 : cycles elimination on @xmath55 .",
    "+ the numbers of the form @xmath56 are sometimes called `` box numbers '' ( analogous to the square numbers @xmath57 ) and we introduce notation @xmath58 .",
    "now we rewrite the first equation of sys .",
    "( [ prosetdef1 ] ) as[prodef1 ] m_1/b_1+m_2/b_2=m_1/b_3+m_2/b_3 or [ profr ] m_2 = m_1 let us find the greatest common divisor gcd of the numerator and denominator of the fraction on the right side and reduce by it .",
    "the equation now has the form [ profrred ] m_2 = m_1 and every solution has the form [ prosol ] m_1=kr_d , m_2 = kr_n , k min(n_1/r_d , n_3/(r_n+r_d)).the second condition follows from [ profrred ] m_3 = m_1 + m_2 n_3 and is stronger than @xmath59 .",
    "+ the computational complexity of the whole algorithm is thus @xmath60 , @xmath61 for the cycle on @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the gcd .",
    "+ [ [ remark ] ] remark + + + + + + + the algorithm above implies operating with numbers of the order of @xmath64 in one certain place , namely , transforming [ remmain ] .",
    "this could lead to overflows be @xmath38 large and computer small , say @xmath40 and 32 bit computer or @xmath65 and 64 bit computer .",
    "there is , however , an elegant way to avoid difficulties at this point which we describe in the next step . +",
    "* step 3 : avoiding multiplications .",
    "+ given the fraction product , we first reduce @xmath66 and @xmath67 by their gcd , then @xmath68 and @xmath69 by their gcd .",
    "this leaves us with a product of two irreducible fractions @xmath70 .",
    "now we reduce crosswise : @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the last reduction gives an `` irreducible product '' of two fractions @xmath75 , i.e. had we performed the multiplications , the resulting fraction would stay irreducible .",
    "the reduction schema is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : red ] .",
    "+ + we still do not perform multiplications for fear of an overflow .",
    "but now it is evident that a solution can only exist if @xmath76 .",
    "we first check these inequalities ; if one or more of them do not hold , we proceed with the @xmath35-cycle , otherwise we may safely perform multiplications ( both products do not exceed @xmath77 ) and look for solutions .",
    "the turbulence of the drift waves is described by the same equation as in sec.2.1 but in descartes coordinates and in the infinite channel@xcite . in this case dispersion function",
    "has a ( slightly simplified ) form @xmath78 and resonance conditions are [ prosetdef2 ]    _1 + _2 = _3 + m_1+m_2=m_3 + m_i n_i i=1,2,3 + n_i n_j i j +    search cycles on @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath49 become somewhat more extensive due to the lack of the two conditions mentioned above . on the other hand ,",
    "the core of the algorithm - the four reductions ( step 2 ) - are preserved one - to - one , as well as the post - reduction overflow check ( step 3 ) .",
    "the computational complexity of the whole algorithm is also @xmath60 as in the previous case .",
    "our algorithm has been implemented in vba programming language ; for @xmath40 computation time ( without disk output of solutions found ) on a low - end pc ( 800 mhz pentium iii , 512 mb ram ) is about 7.5 minutes .",
    "altogether 7282 solutions ( example 1 ) have been found .",
    "some overall numerical data is given in the tables and figures below .",
    "+    in fig.[f : ex1_sol ] the number of solutions in partial domains is shown for the first example ( atmospheric planetary waves ) and we conclude that the solutions are concentrated along @xmath79 and @xmath80 axes . in fig.[f :",
    "ex1_hist ] the histogram of vector multiplicities is presented which shows in how many solutions one vector can participate . on the axis",
    "@xmath79 the multiplicity of a vector is shown and on the axis @xmath80 the number of vectors with a given multiplicity .",
    "one can see immediately that most part of vectors take part only in one solution and multiplicity decreases exponentially with the number of solutions .",
    "+    as to our second example ( drift waves in a channel ) we notice , first of all , much less solutions ( @xmath81 ) in the same main domain @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , not much can be said about the asymptotic of solution number in partial domains . there is no need to present multiplicities graphically in this case . in the whole calculation domain @xmath40",
    "there is just one vector @xmath82 participating in solutions with multiplicity @xmath83 , one vector @xmath84 with multiplicity @xmath85 and the overall distribution is as follows : +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + table 1 .",
    "example 2 : vector multiplicities .",
    "+ in order to understand the energetic behavior of 2-dimensional discrete wave system , the standard way is to present is graphically on the integer lattice in following way .",
    "each node with coordinates @xmath86 presents a corresponding wave vector @xmath87 and nodes - vectors are connected by lines is they are parts of the same solution .",
    "an example of this _ geometrical _ structure is given in fig.[f : geom ] .",
    "+    this geometrical representation is needed in order to understand what sort of equations ( odes ) for the amplitudes of resonantly interacting waves we have to solve .",
    "namely , one single triangle in @xmath88-space corresponds to [ sing ]    _ 1= _ 1 a_2a_3 + _",
    "2= _ 2 a_1a_3 + _ 3= _ 3 a_1a_2    where coefficients @xmath89 are known functions on @xmath90 .",
    "if one wave takes part in two solutions , we get two systems of this form connected _ via _ this wave , for instance , if the second solution corresponds to @xmath91 and they are connected _ via _ one wave , say @xmath92 , then corresponding system of odes takes form [ but ]    _ 1= _ 1 a_2a_3 + _",
    "2= _ 2 a_1a_3 + _ 3= ( _ 3a_1a_2 + _",
    "4a_5a_6 ) + _ 5= _ 5 a_3a_6 + _ 6= _ 6 a_3a_5    and so on .",
    "+ obviously , the geometrical structure is too confusing to be informative and what we really need is a _ topological _ structure of a solution set , i.e. the graph formed by triangles as _ primary elements_. namely , it is enough to compute all _ non - isomorphic _ topological elements because all isomorphic elements are described by the same system of odes .",
    "for instance , all primary elements ( isolated resonant triads ) are described by ( [ sing ] ) , all `` butterflies '' ( groups of two connected triads ) are described by ( [ but ] ) , etc .",
    "the difference between two isomorphic topological elements lies in the coefficients @xmath89 which are functions of the wave numbers , and therefore , will take different magnitudes for different resonant triads .",
    "topological structure of the solution set for our first example is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ex1_top ] for domain @xmath93 this domain contains 42 solutions : 15 isolated triangles , two `` butterflies '' ( groups of two connected triangles ) , one chain of three connected triangles and two more complex graphs . +",
    "this paper concludes the series of three papers on generic algorithms for laminated wave turbulence .",
    "we have presented algorithms for polynomial dispersion function depending irrationally on the wave vector length @xmath94 and for an arbitrary rational dispersion function .",
    "we have also shown that the topological elements of the solution set ( for the discrete layer of turbulence ) give the whole information about the energy transport in these wave systems .",
    "in fact we applied this approach for our first example ( atmospheric planetary waves ) and studied all the topological elements in the meteorologically significant domain ( @xmath95 ) for climate range processes@xcite .",
    "more precisely , we have found analytically solutions of corresponding systems of the form ( [ sing ] ) in terms of jacobean elliptic functions and computed their periods and other properties for characteristic meteorological data . as a result , a novel model of",
    "the known physical phenomena - intra - seasonal oscillations in the earth atmosphere - has been developed . +",
    "our further interest lies now in the area of symbolic computations . indeed , beginning with an equation like ( [ bve ] ) with given boundary conditions",
    ", we have a completely constructive procedure of obtaining precise form for : i ) resonance conditions ( [ open ] ) ; ii ) coefficients @xmath89 of the primary element ( [ sing ] ) ; iii ) all topological elements - as graphs and as corresponding systems of odes .",
    "all this can be programmed symbolically in mathematica and solutions can be found using our generic algorithms .",
    "this is an on - going work now and we plan to create a useful program tool for making basic research in the area of discrete wave turbulence .",
    "there are some open mathematical questions yet to be solved - for instance , the problem of graph isomorphism appearing at the step when all different topological elements have to be computed .",
    "+ another possible development would be the study of the 4-wave interactions , that is , with primary elements being not triads but quartets of waves ( see example of gravitational water waves@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the same constructive procedure as for 3-wave interactions can be applied but the resulting topology will be much more complicated due to the principal difference between 3- and 4-wave systems",
    ". in 3-wave system there exist the only mechanism for the energy transport - transport over the scales . in 4-wave system",
