    "in this supplementary notes , we want to explicitly outline how , starting from the master equation associated with the stochastic may - leonard model [ defined by the reactions  ( 1 ) ] , the set of stochastic partial differential equations ( 3 ) can be obtained via system size expansion .    for the sake of illustration , here we focus on the role of internal noise stemming from the reactions  ( 1 ) , and ignore spatial degrees of freedom . as detailed in a forthcoming publication",
    "[ 18 ] , and following the reasoning presented in  [ 16 ] , in a proper continuum limit , the spatial dispersal of individuals is accounted by diffusive terms in the spde ( 3 ) . + as in the main text , the overall number of individuals is denoted @xmath29 and @xmath101 stands for the frequencies ( or densities ) of the species @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath2 in the population ( i.e. @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) .",
    "the master equation giving the time - evolution of the probability @xmath104 of finding the system in the state @xmath105 at time @xmath106 then reads @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the transition probability from state @xmath105 to the state @xmath109 within one time step ( loss term ) , @xmath110 is the analogous gain term , and the summation extends over all possible changes @xmath111 . as an example , the relevant changes @xmath112 in the density @xmath113 resulting from the basic reactions ( 1 ) are @xmath114 in the third reaction , @xmath115 in the fourth , and zero in all others .",
    "we also choose the unit of time such that , on average , every individual reacts once per time step .",
    "the transition rates resulting from the reactions  ( 1 ) then read @xmath116 for the reaction @xmath117 ( the prefactor of @xmath29 enters due to our choice of time scale , where @xmath29 reactions occur in one unit of time ) and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "transition probabilities associated with all other reactions ( 1 ) follow similarly .",
    "the system size , or kramers - moyal , expansion ( sze )  [ 16 ] of the master equation is an expansion in the increment @xmath111 , which is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the sze may be understood as an expansion in the inverse system size @xmath47 . to second order in @xmath111",
    ", it yields the ( generic ) fokker - planck equation [ 16 ] : @xmath120+\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_i\\partial_j[\\mathcal{b}_{ij}({\\bm s})p({\\bm s},t ) ] ~. \\label{fokker_planck}\\ ] ] for the system under consideration , in the above the indices @xmath121 and the summation convention in ( [ fokker_planck ] ) implies sums carried over them . according to the kramers - moyal expansion ( or sze ) , the quantities @xmath122 and @xmath123 are given by [ 16 ] @xmath124 note that @xmath125 is symmetric . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we outline the calculation of @xmath126 : the relevant changes @xmath127 result from the third and fourth reactions in  ( 1 ) , as described above .",
    "the corresponding rates respectively read @xmath116 and @xmath118 , resulting in @xmath128 .",
    "the other quantities are computed analogously .",
    "all explicit expressions for @xmath129 and @xmath130 will be derived and given in detail in [ 18 ] .",
    "the well - known correspondence between fokker - planck equations and ito calculus [ 16 ] implies that  ( [ fokker_planck ] ) is equivalent to the following set of ito stochastic differential equations ( with the above summation convention ) : @xmath131 where the matrix @xmath132 is defined from @xmath125 via the relation @xmath133 [ 16 ] , and the @xmath134 s denote ( uncorrelated ) gaussian white noise terms .",
    "note that for the model under consideration @xmath125 is diagonal and one can therefore always choose a diagonal matrix for @xmath132 [ see eq .",
    "( 5 ) ] , with only @xmath135 s contributing to the right - hand side of eqs .  ( 11 ) .    in ref.[18 ] , we demonstrate that ( in a proper continuum limit ) spatial degrees of freedom and exchange processes simply yield additional diffusive terms @xmath136 in ( [ stoch_part_eq ] ) .",
    "this leads to the spde ( 3 ) , given and discussed in the main text , in which the @xmath137s still denote gaussian white noise contributions .",
    "the spde  ( 3 ) and the cgle  ( 6 ) , as well as the analytical predictions  ( 7 ) , are valid in all spatial dimensions . while in the text , for the sake of specificity",
    ", we mainly focus on the two - dimensional situation , here we comment on some features of the one - dimensional version of the system , as well as on some properties of the general situation in higher dimensions .    in one dimension and in the absence of exchange processes",
    "( mixing ) , our model is expected to exhibit coarsening like the cyclic lotka - volterra model ( see e.g.  [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the same phenomenon still occurs in the presence of very slow mixing rate ( for the model under consideration , this means very low values of the exchange rate @xmath11 ) . on the other hand , and as shown in the main text , in the presence of ( finite ) mixing the systems behavior is aptly described by the spde  ( 3 ) .",
    "the underlying cgle  ( 6 ) predicts the propagation of traveling waves , with velocity and wavelength still given by the analytical expression  ( 7 ) .",
    "similarly to what has been found in the two - dimensional system  [ 6 ] , if the exchange rate is `` moderate '' , i.e. below a certain mobility threshold but still finite [ 6,15 ] , the system confirms these predictions and the species coexist .",
    "however , due to stochastic events and the presence of absorbing boundaries , some domains will occasionally merge , resulting in growing domains .",
    "this coarsening phenomenon will happen on a much longer time - scale than in the absence of the mixing processes . above the threshold value for the diffusivity ,",
    "the system is well - mixed , the underlying spatial structure plays no role , and the description in terms of the rate equations ( 2 ) is valid . in this mean - field scenario ,",
    "the system approaches an absorbing steady state and no patterns emerge .    in higher dimensions ( i.e. in dimensions @xmath138 ) ,",
    "the description of the stochastic spatial system in terms of the spde  ( 3 ) and of the cgle  ( 7 ) is again valid for `` moderate '' ( or intermediate ) mixing ( i.e. for a finite mobility rate which is below a certain critical threshold , see [ 6 ] ) . in this situation , and as discussed in the main text , the description in terms of the cgle  ( 6 ) is qualitatively valid and predicts the emergence of moving spiral waves in two dimensions ( which is the case discussed in detail in the main text , see also [ 6,15 ] ) , and to `` scroll waves '' , i.e. vortex filaments , in three dimensions [ 24 ] ."
