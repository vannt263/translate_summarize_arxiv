    "the underlying source of their masses and transitions , though these are being mapped out with impressive accuracy , is unknown . will the successes of qcd and the quark model repeat themselves at another level ? some suggest that quark and lepton masses and couplings are as random as the orbits of the planets in the solar system .",
