    "the ads / cft correspondence proposed in @xcite is a prescription for calculating correlation functions for an operator @xmath0 that creates states belonging to a cft on the boundary .",
    "it is not surprising that a relationship between the two theories exits ; they share same symmetry group .",
    "the conjectured equivalence between the two theories , however , is surprising .",
    "this paper endeavors to explain the equivalence .",
    "one explanation relies on the fact that the fourier transform of a function defined on anti - de sitter space is a function defined on the boundary . to put it another way : the usual quantization procedure of fourier transforming a function and promoting the coefficients to operators yields operators that create states that only exist on the boundary . in this regard",
    "a cft naturally arises as the quantized version of a classical theory in anti - de sitter space .",
    "the fourier transform is derived following a geometrical technique that was first worked out by gelfand and graev @xcite ( the transform bears their names ) and later by n.j .",
    "vilenkin @xcite .",
    "this method of deriving a fourier transformation for functions on the hyperboloid follows from the analogous derivation of the euclidean transformation .",
    "one can derive the @xmath1 euclidean fourier transformation in the following way : first calculate the radon transform of a function over a plane of dimension @xmath2 and then carry out a @xmath3 fourier transform over the stack of planes .",
    "the generalization of the radon transform to a homogeneous space of constant negative curvature is the gelfand - graev transform .",
    "this is the integral transform of a function over a horosphere , which is the analogy of a plane in ads .",
    "the @xmath4 fourier transform reduces this function to its homogeneous components .    when quantizing a field in ads one finds states defined on the boundary .",
    "there is a tower of states at each point , where each rung on the tower is related to the fourier transform of the point - horosphere distance function .",
    "this method confirms the belief that the bulk function can be viewed as a weighted superposition of boundary states ; this is none other than the definition of the fourier transform .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : first we present a short overview of the two ads / cft formalisms to remind the reader what we are trying to point out . following this ,",
    "we briefly review one method of deriving the @xmath1 euclidean fourier transform .",
    "next we use this method to find the @xmath1 fourier transformation for euclidean ads ( bolyai - lobachevsky ) and take into account group theoretic considerations .",
    "we use the transformation to study a free scalar field in ads and finally conclude with future considerations .",
    "the ads / cft relates an @xmath5 dimensional classical theory on ads to a @xmath6 dimensional cft that lives on the boundary .",
    "the two main approaches are that of witten @xcite and the smearing function technique used in @xcite",
    ". we will start with the former .",
    "the classical bulk action acts as a generating functional for an operator living on the boundary : @xmath7 in practice , one integrates the action by parts : @xmath8 and then differentiates with respect to @xmath9 in order to generate correlation functions for the operator @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath10 is the surface element of the boundary and points perpendicular to the boundary ( in the @xmath11 direction ) and hence picks out only the @xmath11 component of the derivative . here",
    "the @xmath12 term on the right vanishes since @xmath13 satisfies the classical wave equation .",
    "the first term on the right would generally be thrown away in flat - space physics since it is a boundary term . in ads",
    "we can not simply throw this away because the boundary at infinity can be reached in finite coordinate time so the interior is still accessible from there .",
    "the derivative of @xmath13 is evaluated at the boundary .",
    "thus we can write : @xmath14 at this point the usual practice is to substitute @xmath13 in terms of green s functions that propagate a boundary value of the field to an interior point and then to differentiate with respect to the boundary value in order to generate correlation functions . if one has extra terms in the lagrangian a similar technique is applied .",
    "the method involving smearing functions is as follows .",
    "the bulk field is expressed in terms of its behavior near the boundary : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is known as the smearing function and is calculated from the wave equation .",
    "the fact that the smearing function is derived from the wave equation hints our interpretation is correct because the fourier transform is really a plane wave expansion , in hyperbolic space plane waves are just defined differently .",
    "generically we will refer to irreducible representations of the symmetry group of a space as plane waves .",
    "the correspondence between fields and operators is as follows : @xmath17 and correlation functions between bulk states are equivalent to superpositions of boundary states weighted by the smearing function : @xmath18 we now begin with flat space transforms in order to see how smearing functions are consistent with the fourier interpretation of the cft .",
    "before we use integral geometry to derive the ads fourier transform we will first use the same techniques to calculate the fourier transform of a function @xmath19 defined on @xmath1 euclidean space .",
    "the first step in this method is to calculate the radon transform of @xmath19 over some @xmath20 hyperplane .",
    "the radon transform of @xmath19 over the hyperplane @xmath21 is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the measure of the space and @xmath24 denotes the inner product .",
    "the coordinates of the function are now @xmath25 and p. now doing a @xmath4 fourier transform over the collection of planes ( the p coordinate ) yields @xmath26 setting @xmath27 equal to 1 and noting how @xmath13 and p are defined gives the appropriate n - dimensional fourier transform @xmath28 where @xmath29 is nothing more than the volume element of the space .",
    "this is the n - dimensional fourier transform of f(x ) ,        the procedure to calculate the fourier transform of a function @xmath19 in anti - de sitter space is identical .",
    "the generalization of the radon transform is the gelfand - grav transform .",
    "the generalization of the hyperplane is a horosphere .",
    "the mellin transform is used in lieu of a fourier transform ; one can always go between the two by a simple change of variables .",
    "other than these details the procedure is identical - define something analogous to a plane , write the integral transformation of @xmath19 over this plane , carry out a @xmath4 fourier transform over the set of planes .",
    "before we begin it helps to recall that the whole point of fourier transforming is to reduce a function @xmath19 defined on @xmath1 euclidean - ads ( bolyai - lobachevsky ) space into its components that transform under an irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the space .",
    "this is what the usual fourier transformation does for a euclidean space function .",
    "the gelfand - grav transformation maps a function @xmath19 defined on the hyperboloid to a function @xmath30 defined on the cone which makes up the points at infinity .",
    "the mellin transformation reduces this conic function into its homogeneous components , which can be defined on any contour on the cone .",
    "it is in this way in which a function in hyperbolic space is reduced into its homogeneous components .",
    "once we have carried out this reduction we can promote the fourier coefficients to operators and do the usual quantum mechanics .",
    "the distance @xmath31 between two lines in the embedding space that lie inside the cone @xmath32=0 $ ] and pass through the points @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35 ^ 2}{[x , x][y , y]}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the curvature .",
    "when both points lie on the hyperboloid @xmath37=1 $ ] this reduces to @xmath38 ^ 2\\ ] ] as the point @xmath33 approaches the cone ( @xmath37=0 $ ] is geometrically a cone and the points on the cone make up the absolute of the space or the points at infinity ) , the distance between the two points diverges .",
    "points on the cone are zero distance from the origin but infinitely far away from the hyperboloid that is ads .",
    "note that the cone is also an @xmath1 surface .",
    "@xmath25 will be used to denote a point on the cone ; it is also an @xmath5 dimensional vector .",
    "this fact is important to understanding the significance of the fourier transform . in embedding space",
    "coordinates the boundary of ads ( the points at infinity ) is not simply a plane ; it is a surface equal in dimension to that of the hyperboloid .",
    "this is only evident from the embedding space point of view .",
    "from this point of view the embedding space contains hyperboloids and cones which are @xmath1 surfaces in an @xmath39 embedding space .",
    "the fourier transform maps a function on the hyperboloid to a homogeneous function on the cone . since the components are homogeneous it suffices to know the function on one contour intersecting every generator of the cone once , so any conic section will do ; for simplicity pick a circle .",
    "one of these circles coincides with the boundary of the hyperboloid in poincare or plane projective coordinates ( ads coordinate systems are well known , see @xcite for example ) .",
    "this is how a cft can be holographic : scale transformations are equivalent to an extra dimension for a homogeneous function and a homogeneous function on the cone is dual to a function on the ads hyperboloid .",
    "returning to horospheres , take a circle centered at a point @xmath40 and passing through the point @xmath33 on the hyperboloid .",
    "now let @xmath40 move off to the absolute of the space .",
    "this leaves a circle of infinite radius centered on the cone passing through a point @xmath33 on the hyperboloid .",
    "these great circles are horospheres .",
    "a horosphere is defined by the the point on the boundary at which it is centered and the point @xmath33 on the hyperplane through which it passes .",
    "the equation of a horosphere is @xmath41=\\lambda$ ] .",
    "so given a point @xmath33 on the hyperboloid , each point on the cone defines a horosphere .",
    "consequently the collection of horospheres passing through a point is then equivalent to the set of points on the cone .",
    "we now write down the integral transformation of a function on ads over a horosphere .",
    "this transformation is the gelfand -grav transform and is written as follows : @xmath42 @xmath10 is the measure on the horosphere @xmath41=1 $ ] ( the @xmath43 comes from normalization ) and @xmath44 is defined on the set of horospheres passing through a point .",
    "each horosphere though is defined by the point on the cone on which it is centered . since the set of horospheres is equivalent to the points on the cone",
    "we can write the transform as @xmath45 - 1)dx\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the measure of the space and @xmath25 is a point on the cone .",
    "it is in this way that a function defined on ads is mapped to a function on the cone .",
    "we have now written the integral transform over a hyperplane and now need to do the final @xmath4 fourier transform .",
    "note that the integral over the hyperplane is an integral over the points at infinity .",
    "the goal of this final transform is to reduce a function defined on the cone into its homogeneous components .",
    "a function @xmath30 defined on the boundary is reduced to its homogeneous components by a mellin transform : @xmath46 one can substitute in @xmath30 now and do the t integration .",
    "this yields @xmath47^{\\sigma}dx.\\ ] ] this is the fourier transform of a function defined in n - dimensional ads space .",
    "the @xmath48 are the homogeneous components of @xmath30 of degree @xmath49 .",
    "they are not equivalent to the usual @xmath50 , that is to the usual fourier function .",
    "they are the fourier components , so they are equivalent to each individual term in the series , i.e. to each @xmath51 .",
    "it is this function which , when promoted to an operator , will create states on the boundary like @xmath0 does .",
    "the inverse transform for @xmath52 is @xcite @xmath53=0 } \\phi(\\sigma,\\xi)\\delta^{(2m)}([x,\\xi]-1)d\\xi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the @xmath54 integral is taken over the cone and @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath40 can be anything in the range @xmath56 so long as the integral converges .",
    "we can do these integrals to write the transform in a more lucid fashion by exploiting the homogeneity of @xmath48    since @xmath48 is a homogeneous function defined on the cone it is uniquely determined by its values on any contour which intersects every generator of the cone once .",
    "one can see this by using the homogeneity of @xmath48 and writing @xmath57 the right side of the above equation is defined on the intersection of the cone and the plane @xmath58=1 , which is just the sphere @xmath59 . this will be the contour on the cone we choose to integrate over .",
    "we can choose any contour ; this one coincides with the boundary of the hyperboloid .",
    "this then looks like the boundary of ads ",
    "the points at infinity with spherical geometry .",
    "the inverse transform can now be written as ( for @xmath52 ) @xmath60^{-\\sigma-2m}d\\xi'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 denote points on the sphere , which from here on we will simply call @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath48 is defined on a sphere , one can expand it in terms of ultra - spherical harmonics .",
    "@xmath62 where k is a compact notation meaning all of the eigenvalues , e.g. @xmath63 .    for @xmath64 ( embedding space )",
    "the inverse transform becomes @xmath65^{-\\sigma-4}d\\xi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      one can now separate the expansion into positive and negative frequency modes and impose commutation relations on the coefficients . let us now analyze what this means . ignoring the @xmath66 parameter for a minute , it is evident that the fourier transform of a function in ads is a function defined on the boundary of the space .",
    "if one were to promote the coefficients to operators one finds that they create / annihilate states on the boundary with quantum numbers given by those of the ultra - spherical harmonics , i.e. states that transform under @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath66 determines the weight of the representation .",
    "what we see is a tower of states existing on the boundary with each rung transforming under a different irreducible representation given by @xmath66 .",
    "it is the sum of these states on the boundary , integrated over the boundary , that is equivalent to the bulk field .",
    "we now explain the role of the fourier transform .",
    "the cone and the hyperboloid are two @xmath1 quadratic surfaces embedded in an @xmath5 dimensional space and consequently they have the same group of motions .",
    "they have different little groups , however , and are thus different homogeneous spaces .",
    "in other words they have the same group of motions , but different realizations of these motions .",
    "@xmath68 provides a case study .",
    "@xmath68 is embedded in @xmath69 which has the group of motions @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath68 is the homogeneous space @xmath71 which is the quotient space of @xmath72 .",
    "this realization of the group of motions are the hyperbolic rotations .",
    "@xmath70 has other choices of one parameter subgroups to serve as the stabilization group .",
    "one of these is the group z of lower triangular matrices @xmath73 .",
    "the homogeneous space @xmath74 also has the isometry group @xmath71 .",
    "this realization of the group of motions , however , is that of the conformal generators defined on the cone .",
    "the fourier transform serves as a map between these two homogeneous spaces , and thus they are dual",
    ".    the kernel of the fourier transform must then be functions which are irreducible representations of the group . to find these functions , given the wave operator @xmath75",
    ", one needs to expand in eigenfunctions of @xmath75 invariant with respect to the subgroup z of the cone , the little group",
    ". these will be the analog of the plane waves of the usual fourier transform .",
    "one eigenfunction of @xmath75 with an eigenvalue of @xmath76 invariant with respect to the group z is @xmath77 , where @xmath11 is the analog of the @xmath78 dimension in poincare coordinates @xmath79 and @xmath66 is the weight of the representation . under all possible translations",
    ", these will transform @xcite into functions of the form @xmath80^{-(i \\rho+a)}$ ] where @xmath81 is the point to horosphere distance function .",
    "these are the kernels of our transform derived earlier from geometric considerations .",
    "these are the same solutions to the wave equations that play the role of green s functions .",
    "it can be clearly seen now how a theory on ads and a cft can be dual to one another , and the role the fourier transform plays in realizing this duality .      since the fourier components @xmath82 are defined on any contour encircling the cone we can pick a spherical contour and expand the fourier functions in terms of ultra - spherical harmonics .",
    "because the fourier components act on the boundary to create states that can be represented by spherical harmonics it is easy to see how this process could be overlooked since ultimately it will not change any of the current results of the ads / cft . the integrals and correlation functions will not change .",
    "what is being added is a quantization process .",
    "let us check the generators now for @xmath83 .",
    "we started with a function on the hyperboloid invariant under the isometries of @xmath84 as @xmath85 rotations .",
    "we then transformed to another function of @xmath66 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath66 is an invariant , it is equivalent to the energy and we have seen it is the weight of the representation .",
    "@xmath86 is defined on a @xmath87 and is consequently @xmath67 invariant . by letting @xmath88 and exploiting the homogeneity of @xmath86",
    "we see that the transformation is also invariant under dilatations . to summarize our result ,",
    "we transformed from the @xmath85 rotations of ads to a function that is @xmath67 invariant . the transformation is invariant under dilatations and special conformal transformations ( by closure ) .",
    "these are almost the generators of a cft .",
    "the only thing left to do is to reduce the @xmath67 to @xmath89 + translations . because any contour on the boundary is equivalent , the contour on the cone coinciding with the boundary of ads is equivalent to the contour on the cone of infinite radius .",
    "we can pick this and that yields the proper group reduction via a wigner - inonu contraction .",
    "the group we want to contract with respect to is the group @xmath89 .",
    "we will also see what happens to the group representations when we do this .    to carry out the wigner - inonu contraction we break up the generators into two sets : @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the @xmath89 subgroup .",
    "next we redefine the @xmath12 generator @xmath94 .",
    "the final step is to write down the revised commutation relations between the two sets and take the limit as @xmath95 goes to zero .",
    "the result is that an @xmath89 subgroup is projected out and we are left with four commuting generators that become the translations , recovering the cft generators .",
    "we note that @xmath95 is not dimensionless ; it is equal to @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the radius of the sphere ( contour ) we choose on the boundary .",
    "the last thing to do is to look at how the representations contract .",
    "we can view the ten generators of @xmath67 as ten rotations acting on the state @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the dimension of the representation .",
    "contracting the representation involves taking the limit as @xmath99 goes to infinity and @xmath95 goes to zero while keeping the product fixed :    @xmath100    @xmath101    this is reminiscent of the thooft limit . when one takes the limit as the @xmath102 of @xmath103 goes to infinity that can be thought of as saying that the dimension of the fundamental representation is going to infinity .",
    "the string coupling constant is related to the radius of the space .",
    "so although we are not taking the limit as @xmath102 goes to infinity , we are also taking the dimension of the representation to infinity .",
    "it is tempting to say there is a deeper connection , but this will be left to future work .",
    "since the constant @xmath104 has units of @xmath105 it seems natural to take this as the qcd scale @xcite and call it @xmath106 .",
    "a better way to look at the states is to realize that one can represent @xmath67 as @xmath107 .",
    "so we can write down the states as @xmath108 .",
    "the ten generators of @xmath67 act on the states as follows : we get two commuting copies of @xmath109 that act on each space separately as @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 the remaining four generators are bilinears that act on both states simultaneously : raising both , lowering both , or the two combinations of raising one and lowering the other .",
    "when one contracts and takes @xmath99 to infinity the two copies of su(2 ) decouple ( the bilinears are the four @xmath113 s from before that become the translations ) and we are left with two copies of su(2 ) as our representation of @xmath89 and a knowledge of how the generators act on these states .",
    "now that we know how classical fields correspond to states , and how the generators act on those states , we can start probing deeper into the ads / cft .",
    "perhaps the most useful aspect of this realization of the ads / cft is how it will relate to qcd . if analytically continued quark states can be mapped to the appropriate representation of @xmath114 it should be possible to find the ads dual of this scenario .",
    "furthermore , in the contraction scheme the dimensionful parameter @xmath106 might help to explain the conformal limit of qcd ( @xmath115 ) and how when @xmath106 is not equal to zero there is a length scale .",
    "it is still unclear if there are any considerations that might compel a specific choice of @xmath106 .",
    "if we take this formulation of the ads / cft at face value , then when taking the functional derivatives we are literally bringing down a @xmath116 . this is where the correlation functions for the operator @xmath0 come from : this classical function expressed in terms of green s functions .",
    "these are the classical quantities that perfectly match a quantum theory .",
    "if interaction terms are added , regardless of the strength of the coupling constant , one is still bringing down classical functions expressed in terms of green s functions .",
    "the question left unanswered is where the quantum nature of the ads / cft comes from .",
    "it turns out this formulation of the ads / cft it tells us precisely what to quantize : @xmath117 for a free field theory .",
    "we can view this functional differentiation in terms of correlation functions .",
    "we can also view the functional differentiation in the sense of bringing down a quantum operator that acts on the boundary vacuum .",
    "this quantum operator is just @xmath116 quantized via the usual method : fourier transforming and promoting the coefficients to creation / annihilation operators .",
    "this is reconciled because in @xcite the green s functions are used to propagate the boundary values .",
    "the derivative does not act on the boundary value of @xmath13 , it acts on the green s function .",
    "in fact the weight functions derived here are functionally identical to the green s functions used in @xcite .",
    "their distance @xmath49 is equivalent to our @xmath118 $ ] , which as we saw earlier is nothing but a distance function .",
    "the values of the two distance functions match up for a null , space - like , and time like vectors , confirming our interpretation of the role of the fourier transform and that the fourier weights play the role of the green s function .",
    "to answer the question of why does it just act on the boundary vacuum is easy : the quantum states exist only on the boundary , they do not exist in the bulk .",
    "this is what this fourier transform teaches us .",
    "so we can now correctly view the ads / cft in terms of correlation functions or make use of the fourier transform to go beyond correlation functions and view it in terms of individual quantum states created on the boundary .",
    "the relationship between the fourier transform and the ads / cft becomes apparent when one considers the smearing function formalism of the ads / cft .",
    "this formalism states the correspondence as : @xmath119 from our point of view , we can replace the arrow by an equality .",
    "@xmath0 is the fourier coefficient @xmath120 that creates states on the boundary and the smearing function @xmath16 is related to the green s function in the usual fashion .",
    "the green s function is the fourier weight . because the smearing functions are derived from the green s function it suffices to know the green s function , which we now calculate from the fourier transformation for @xmath121 ( ads@xmath122 ) :    @xmath123^{-\\sigma-1}d\\xi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "now let us expand @xmath48 in terms of ultra - spherical harmonics as before and change the order of integration , isolating the @xmath49 integral .",
    "@xmath124^{-\\sigma-1 } ] \\rbrace   \\xi_k(\\xi ) \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the term in @xmath125 depends only the variables @xmath25 and @xmath34 as we are integrating over @xmath49 .",
    "we can do a change of variables from a complex @xmath49 to a real @xmath66 by means of the following substitution : @xmath126 .",
    "this integral has a simple pole at @xmath127 .",
    "we are free to choose @xmath40 so long as the integral converges and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the conformal weight , is a good choice . for odd dimensional embedding spaces",
    "this integral has a pole at @xmath127 and only @xmath40 is left . for even dimensional embedding spaces",
    "it seems all terms need to be included . for @xmath121 embedding space , the sigma integral @xmath130^{\\delta-1 } a_k ( -\\delta)$ ] .",
    "we can relabel the boundary coordinate @xmath25 and call it @xmath131 .",
    "using poincare coordinates for the bulk , we can also rewrite the weight function minus the operator as @xmath132 .",
    "the transform then reads : @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "the function @xmath135^{\\delta-1}$ ] looks like the green s function of @xcite where @xmath136 $ ] is equivalent to their @xmath49 .",
    "once we know the green s functions we necessarily know the smearing functions because these are calculated from the green s functions .",
    "this entails taking the derivative normal to the boundary of the green s function to find @xmath137 , which is precisely what one must do to get the quantum operator @xmath0 in the generating functional formalism .",
    "we have come full circle and can see now how these two formalisms can be resolved by making use for the fourier transform .    because @xmath137 inherits its properties from the green s function it obeys the desired properties of the smearing functions mentioned in @xcite , such as compact support on the boundary .",
    "we can interpret @xmath138 as a quantum operator that acts on the boundary vacuum to create states of weight @xmath139 that transform under the cft representation of @xmath84 .",
    "as discussed earlier , the states can be represented by @xmath114 .",
    "the states created on the boundary are localized on the boundary but are non - local on the boundary .",
    "this confirms the known ads / cft fact that the boundary operators are non - local .    without loss of generality one can add a 5th coordinate that coincides with the boundary , @xmath140 , to @xmath138 and",
    "rewrite it as @xmath141 .",
    "this is useful to express functions defined on a section of the cone and those defined on the hyperboloid in the same coordinates .",
    "@xmath141 looks just like the boundary value of a bulk field in addition to an operator that creates conformal states on the boundary .",
    "the difference is in the former case one is interpreting the classical fourier transform ; if one imposes commutation relations the form of the transform does not change .",
    "only the interpretation changes which leads us to the latter case .",
    "the fact that @xmath141 is interpreted as the boundary value of a field is enhanced by @xcite .",
    "there it is pointed how one can pull out the @xmath11 dependence of the field with degree of homogeneity @xmath129 and that fields behaving like this near the boundary are the normalizable modes .",
    "one can only do this if the field is homogeneous function in all variables . in this case",
    "@xmath129 is the degree of homogeneity and the weight of the representation .",
    "this precisely fits our knowledge of how the fourier functions behave and explains why only fields with this particular fall - off near the boundary are considered : they are not boundary values of a classical field at all . they are fourier components that look like particular field configurations . in viewing the fourier coefficients as creation and annihilation operators",
    "it is clear why classical fields correspond to boundary operators .",
    "the fact that the degree of homogeneity of the transform is @xmath139 is not a problem because of how @xmath11 is defined . in poincare coordinates",
    ", @xmath11 is the inverse of the @xmath78 coordinate .",
    "so when the @xmath78 coordinate is factored out it is of degree @xmath139 , meaning that in poincare coordinates it is of degree @xmath129 , which is what we expect .",
    "this is in line with the normalizable modes falling off as @xmath142 near the boundary .",
    "the limits on @xmath40 come from requiring the @xmath49 integral to converge , and this range of @xmath40 corresponds to the normalizable modes of fields allowed in the correspondence .",
    "in addition , any term in the lagrangian , regardless of coupling , can be written exactly in terms of these @xmath138 s as a composite operator .",
    "an alternative map between a classical theory in anti - de sitter space and a cft on the boundary of the space is found .",
    "the result is that the cft can be viewed as the quantized version of a classical theory in ads .",
    "this becomes evident after considering the fourier transform of a function defined on ads .",
    "the reason a function on ads is dual to a function defined on the conical boundary is that both spaces are different quotient spaces of the same group , only with different little groups .",
    "the fourier transform is a map that goes between the two spaces or representations of the symmetry group .",
    "the conic function can be reduced in dimensionality because homogeneous functions in @xmath143 are equivalent to scale invariant theories in one less dimension . from the hyperboloid s point of view , in plane - projective coordinates for example , the contour we reduce the conical function to can always be chosen to be the contour coinciding with the boundary of ads .",
    "we are thus forced to reinterpret the role boundary values of the fields play as well as required fall - offs in terms of fourier coefficients defined on the boundary .",
    "this has been made possible by considering both the hyperboloid and cone from the embedding space point of view and allowed us to find the underlying reasons why ads and a cft are dual .",
    "in addition to the qcd considerations already discussed the other main application is to consider what this technique has to say about the ads / cft and black holes , this is the subject of current work . in analyzing the @xmath144 dimensional ads black hole in @xcite the authors pointed out how ads black hole solutions could be viewed as quotient spaces of ads . in light of our results , it is conceivable that by taking the appropriate quotient space of a cft one could arrive at the cft dual of an ads black hole .",
    "after this , it is hoped that by using the same integral geometry techniques one should be able to arrive at a similar integral transform relating the two theories . in addition , it should also be possible to arrive at the transformation from geometric considerations only .",
    "a rotating black hole black hole either corresponds to a chemical potential or a rotating einstein static universe . in the latter case",
    ", one can imagine trying to view this integral geometry set up from this perspective .",
    "in that case , in order to achieve the desired planes to integrate over as part of the gelfand - graev transform , one must set the boundary points in the integral transform rotating , and herein lies this duality . in both cases one just needs to define the appropriate planes to integrate over",
    "this hopefully will teach us about the microstates of ads black holes .",
