    "in order to infer as comprehensive as possible information about the space - time pattern of leptoproduced quark string fragmentation processes , experimental data on nuclear targets are needed , not only concerning the production of stable hadrons , but also hadronic resonances . at present ,",
    "more or less detailed experimental data collected in neutrinonuclear interactions are available only for neutral @xmath0 mesons ( @xcite and references therein ) , while those for charged @xmath0 mesons are rather scarce and obtained at comparatively high energies of ( anti)neutrino , @xmath13 40 - 50 gev @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the neutrinoproduction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons in neutrino - nucleus ( @xmath14 a ) and neutrino - nucleon ( @xmath14 n ) charged current interactions at intermadiate energies ( @xmath15 10 gev ) . in section 2 , the experimental procedure is described .",
    "section 3 presents the experimental data including : a ) the inclusive production of @xmath16 mesons ; b ) the mean multiplicities of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons and the ratios of @xmath0 meson to pion yields , compared to the data at higher energies @xcite ; c ) the quasiexclusive and coherent single @xmath2 neutrinoproduction on nuclear targets . the results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the experiment was performed with skat bubble chamber @xcite , exposed to a wideband neutrino beam obtained with a 70 gev primary protons from the serpukhov accelerator .",
    "the chamber was filled with a propane - freon mixture containing 87 vol% propane ( @xmath17 ) and 13 vol% freon ( @xmath18 ) with the percentage of nuclei h : c : f : br = 67.9:26.8:4.0:1.3 % .",
    "a 20 kg uniform magnetic field was provided within the operating chamber volume .",
    "+ charged ( cc ) current interactions containing a negative muon with momentum @xmath190.5 gev / c were selected .",
    "other negatively charged particles were considered to be @xmath20 mesons . protons with momentum below 0.6 gev@xmath21 and a fraction of protons with momentum 0.6 - 0.85",
    "gev@xmath21 were identified by their stopping in the chamber .",
    "non - identified positively charged particles were considered to be @xmath22 mesons .",
    "events in which errors in measuring the momenta of all charged secondaries and photons were less than 60% and 100% , respectively , were selected .",
    "the mean relative error @xmath23 in the momentum measurement for muons , pions and gammas was , respectively , 3% , 6.5% and 19% .",
    "each event is given a weight which corrects for the fraction of events excluded due to improperly reconstruction .",

    "+ further , the whole event sample was subdivided , using several topological and kinematical criteria @xcite , into three subsamples : the cascade subsample @xmath33 with a sign of intranuclear secondary interaction , the quasiproton ( @xmath34 ) and quasineutron ( @xmath35 ) subsamples .",
    "about 40% of subsample @xmath34 is contributed by interactions with free hydrogen .",
    "weighting the quasiproton events with a factor of 0.6 , one can compose a pure nuclear subsample @xmath36 and a quasinucleon subsample @xmath37 .",
    "it has been verified @xcite , that the multiplicity and spectral characteristics of secondary particles in the @xmath38 subsample are in satisfactory agreement with those measured with a pure proton ( deuteron ) target .",
    "the effective atomic weight corresponding to the subsample @xmath39 is estimated @xcite to be approximately equal to @xmath40 , when taking into account the probability of secondary intranuclear interactions in the composite target .",

    "1 shows the two - gamma effective mass distribution for the total sample of events corrected for losses of non - registered or rejected @xmath43-quanta ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the @xmath44 - distribution was fitted as a sum of non - relativistic breit - wigner function , with the pole mass @xmath45 and width @xmath46 as free parameters , and the background distribution of the form @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath43 as free parameters .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath50 gev@xmath51 and @xmath52 gev turn out to be compatible with the @xmath16 mass and experimental resolution ( estimated from monte - carlo simulation ) , respectively .",
    "a similar fitting procedure , but with fixed @xmath45 = 0.135 gev@xmath51 and @xmath46 = 0.055 gev , was applied for the quasinucleon and nuclear subsamples , resulting in the @xmath16 mean multiplicities @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",

    "+ the resulting mean yields of charged @xmath0 mesons are presented in table 1 . it should be emphasized , that the sum of extracted yield of @xmath2 at @xmath75 and @xmath76 is in good agreement with the total yield . as expected , the yield of unfavorable @xmath3 ( not containing the current quark ) is much smaller than that of favorable @xmath2 ( which can contain the current quark ) .",
    "the data do not reveal , due to comparatively large statistical errors , significant nuclear effects in charged @xmath0 neutrinoproduction , perhaps except a faint indication on the shifting the @xmath2 @xmath77 - distribution in the nuclear interactions towards backward hemisphere as compared to quasinucleon interactions .",
