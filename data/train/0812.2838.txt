    "a struck quark originated from deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) propagates through the nucleus experiencing multiple interactions which cause induced energy loss . in the string model the medium - induced energy loss results from production of new strings in multiple collisions of the quark @xcite . in a perturbative description",
    "the excess of energy loss is related to medium - induced gluon radiation resulting from broadening of the quark transverse momentum @xcite . in both approaches",
    "induced energy loss rises quadratically with the path - length of the quark .",
    "although induced energy loss contributes to the attenuation of the produced hadron , even stronger suppression may result from absorption of the produced hadron , if the struck quark is neutralized and a colorless dipole is formed inside the nucleus . in the string model ,",
    "the production of a hadron may be described as a two stage process @xcite .",
    "first a prehadron ( e.g. a dipole of small size ) is created , which has a reduced absorption cross section , and later the hadron wave function is formed .",
    "these models @xcite put the main emphasis on the effects of absorption and neglect the induced energy loss .",
    "the attenuation of the produced hadron can be described more consistently within the color - dipole approach employing a path integral technique @xcite which describes the evolution of the dipole propagating through the medium .",

    "@xcite .",
    "some models put the main emphasis on the effects of induced energy loss , assuming that color neutralization of the quark always occurs at long distance from the dis location , i.e. outside of the nucleus @xcite . of course , this assumption may only be valid in certain kinematical domains .",
    "a novel mechanism of hadron attenuation was found recently in ref .",
    "it turns out that even if no induced energy loss occurs , and color neutralization happens outside of the nucleus , a significant nuclear suppression can result from quantum - mechanical interferences between different amplitudes .    in this paper",
    "we study the recent hermes preliminary results @xcite which give preliminary data on @xmath3-broadening of pions produced in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering ( dis ) on ne , kr and xe nuclei .",
    "transverse broadening @xmath4 in the nuclear medium of a nucleus with mass number @xmath5 has been measured as a function of the hadron fractional momentum @xmath6 , of the virtual photon energy @xmath7 and its virtuality @xmath8 , for different nuclear size and for different hadrons . here",
    ", the index @xmath9 in the definition of the transverse broadening refers to a deuteron target .",
    "we use the absorption model @xcite to calculate the nuclear modifications of hadron production in dis .",
    "the hadron formation time is computed analytically in the framework of the lund string fragmentation model as a three - step process . in the first stage the quark ( or antiquark ) ejected from the nucleon propagates and undergoes multiple collisions in the nucleus . in",
    "the second stage color neutralization takes place and a prehadron is formed .",
    "inelastic interactions of the prehadron or hadron result in a considerable shift of the final ( detected ) hadron towards smaller @xmath6 .",
    "we treat this process as absorption .",
    "only elastic rescatterings preserve the ( pre-)hadron and contribute to broadening . however , the elastic cross sections of hadrons and prehadrons are very small compared to the inelastic cross sections . in the third stage the final state hadron is formed from the surviving prehadrons . with an inelastic prehadron nucleon cross section",
    "which is reduced compared to the hadron - nucleon cross section , the model showed rather good agreement with the available hermes data @xcite for pions and kaons . in the lund model , the hadron is formed at the formation length @xmath10 @xmath11 here",
    ", @xmath12 denotes the prehadron formation or production length . for relativistic quarks confined in one dimension",
    "the only scale setting parameter is the string tension @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , in the conventional estimate of the lund model for the formation length enters the photon energy divided by the string tension @xmath14 we have fitted the prehadron cross section to the pion - data for the multiplicity ratios as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and found an optimal fit with a prehadron cross section equal to ( 2/3 ) of the hadron cross section in the extended modelling of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath15 this value of the prehadronic cross section is in agreement with ref .",
    "such a reduction may be partially because the prehadron does not yet have the full size of the hadron and therefore interacts with a smaller cross section due to color transparency .",
    "besides , a considerable reduction should be also expected , since the exponential attenuation of ( pre)hadrons used in the fit ( see below eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) misses the gribov inelastic corrections @xcite , which make nuclei much more transparent @xcite .",
    "further on , we have considered in @xcite the production process for particles which can not be formed from a valence quark in the proton which is knocked out by the photon . for example , negative kaons as well as antiprotons can not be formed by a struck valence quark picking up an antiquark from the string break - up .",
    "they can only be formed from struck sea quarks , which are subdominant at hermes , or from @xmath16 pairs formed inside the colour string .",
    "this different mechanism implies a flavour - dependent formation time from the lund string fragmentation model .",
    "in this paper we want to test the three stage model further by concentrating on quark propagation through the nucleus where most of the transverse momentum is acquired .",
    "the theoretical calculation is very similar to reference @xcite .",
    "the length @xmath12 after which the prehadron is formed @xcite depends on the energy @xmath7 transferred to the quark , the string tension @xmath13 and the energy fraction @xmath6 of the produced hadron",
    ". from energy conservation already follows that if the hadron has a very large @xmath6 the quark can not have radiated very much energy .",
    "therefore the formation length of the colour neutral state must have been very short @xcite .",
    "the prehadron formation length is computed analytically in the framework of the lund string fragmentation model .",

    "the corrections to the simple @xmath21-behavior of the prehadronic formation length @xmath12 given by the gauss hypergeometric function can be recasted into effective powers of @xmath6 and @xmath22 normalized by an appropriate prefactor .",
    "one can obtain an excellent fit to the `` exact '' prehadron formation length by @xmath23 we use the length of the quark trajectory eq .",
    "( [ lp ] ) to calculate with the dipole model the acquired @xmath24 of the quark under the constraint that the subsequent prehadron is not absorbed on its a way through the nucleus , i.e. that it can be finally detected as a hadron .",
    "this is necessary , since the information about the acquired transversal momentum of the struck quark is encoded in the detected hadrons only .",
    "@xmath25 in this equation , the quantity @xmath26 is the mean transverse momentum squared @xmath27 acquired by the quark in one collision multiplied with the corresponding quark nucleon cross section .",
    "this quantity is related to the dipole nucleon cross - section @xcite as shown below .",
    "furthermore , we assume a sharp distribution of prehadron formation points , namely the prehadron is produced after travelling a distance @xmath12 through the nucleus .",
    "hence , the final induced momentum broadening calculated in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can be read as the mean transverse momentum @xmath27 acquired by the ejected quark in a single collision multiplied with the average number of collisions in the nucleus .",
    "the resulting transverse momentum is averaged over all virtual photon interaction points and weighted by the prehadron survival probability . to be precise , the first integral over the nuclear density @xmath28 averages over all primary interaction points in which a quark is ejected from a nucleon .",
    "the second integral multiplied with the cross section @xmath29 yields the number of collisions suffered by the ejected quark .",
    "the exponential factor at the end represents the prehadron survival probability @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it is dictated by the longitudinal thickness of the nucleus at a given impact parameter @xmath31 and by the mean free path of the prehadron in the nucleus @xmath32 , where the prehadron nucleon cross - section @xmath33 ( see ref .",

    "notice that the quark - nucleon differential cross section @xmath29 is infrared divergent .",
    "for this reason the mean momentum transfer squared @xmath68 . nevertheless , the broadening , @xmath69 , is nonzero and finite .",
    "it results from infinitely many soft rescatterings with vanishingly small momentum transfers .",
    "one can introduce an ad hoc infra - red cutoff and regularize the problem .",
    "however , this cutoff does not affect the final result eq .",

    "the prehadron survival probability is equal to one in this case . for prehadron formation lengths which are smaller than the nuclear diameter",
    ", the in - medium propagation length of the quark equals the prehadron formation length @xmath12 plus some higher order corrections in @xmath92 which are due to the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "these corrections account for the possibility that the prehadron is formed outside of the nucleus such that not the entire prehadron formation length @xmath12 contributes .",
    "the finite size corrections are normalized by the prehadron survival probability , whereas the expression which one would expect for an infinitely extended cold nuclear medium ( the term with @xmath12 ) remains unchanged .",

    ". a possible explanation can be that the prehadron stage contributes to the hadronic broadening . at these low energies",
    "the pion - nucleon elastic cross section is of the same magnitude as the inelastic cross section .",
    "therefore elastic scattering competes with absorption for the outgoing prehadron . since the angular distribution of pion - nucleon scattering has still sizeable contributions from @xmath139-channel exchange , large transverse momentum exchanges are possible .",
    "a good check is possible when the whole angular distribution of the produced hadron is measured .",
    "another important feature of the preliminary clas data is the linear rise with @xmath7 which possibly saturates at @xmath140 gev .",
    "this linear rise is consistent with @xmath141 as proposed in eq .",

    "<S> using a three stage model of hadron formation we calculate the change of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons produced in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) on nuclei . in the first stage after its interaction with the virtual photon , the struck quark propagates quasi free in the nuclear environment undergoing multiple collisions with nucleons . during this stage </S>",
    "<S> it can acquire transverse momentum . in the second stage </S>",
    "<S> a prehadron is formed which has a very small elastic cross section with the nucleons . in the third stage </S>",
    "<S> the prehadron turns into a hadron . for hermes energies , </S>",
    "<S> prehadron elastic scatterings contribute little to @xmath0-broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the acquired extra @xmath1 of hadrons can therefore be deduced entirely from the first stage of quasi free quark propagation with quark - nucleon collisions . </S>",
