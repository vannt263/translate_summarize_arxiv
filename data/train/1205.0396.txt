    "one of the interesting features of these superconductors is the possibility of unconventional pairing arising from electron correlation effects . from this point of view",
    ", there have been efforts to control the strength of the electron correlation via chemical modification of molecules , and this has lead to the discovery of several new superconductors @xcite . among those superconductors , here we focus on a group of organic conductors @xmath0-(bda - ttp)@xmath1f@xmath2 ( @xmath8p , as , sb , ta ) , where bda - ttp is an abbreviation of 2,5-bis(1,3-dithian-2-ylidene)-1,3,4,6-tetrathiapentalene .",

    "in fact , @xmath0-(bda - ttp)@xmath1f@xmath2 exhibit superconductivity with @xmath7=7.5 , 5.8 , 5.9k for @xmath8sb , as , p , respectively @xcite , while @xmath8ta does not superconduct @xcite . the conducting layer is sandwiched by insulating layers of anion @xmath3f@xmath2 as shown in figure [ fig1](a ) , from which we may expect these salts to be quasi - two - dimensional .",

    ", a very recent amro measurement shows that the direction of the anisotropy of the fermi surface differs from the previous amro measurement , and suggests the direction of the major axis of the cross section lies in the @xmath4-b direction of the brillouin zone ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the effective cyclotron mass takes a large value of @xmath10 , which indicates that these materials are strongly correlated electron systems , although the normal state exhibits a metallic nature .",
    "measurements of the upper critical field ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath0-(bda - ttp)@xmath9sbf@xmath2 have shown spin - singlet pairing @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat has indicated presence of a nodal structure in the superconducting order parameter @xcite , and a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) experiment also suggests presence of anisotropy in the gap , where the nodes ( or the gap minima ) lie in the @xmath12 direction @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a recent study of the in - plane anisotropy of @xmath13 shows that the @xmath13 maxima appears when the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath12 direction , i.e. , the nodal direction indicated in the stm measurement @xcite .",

    "sb shows that @xmath7 once increases and takes a maximum under the compression parallel to the stacking direction @xcite .",
    "theoretically , several studies have adopted the models derived from extended h@xmath5ckel calculation , and analysis on superconductivity has also been performed assuming spin fluctuation mediated pairing @xcite .",

    "thus , there are several controversies regarding the relation between experiments and theoretical studies based on the extended h@xmath5ckel model . in the present paper ,",
    "we study theoretically the organic conductors @xmath0-(bda - ttp)@xmath1f@xmath2 ( @xmath8p , as , sb , ta ) based on a model constructed from _ ab - initio _ band calculation based on the density functional theory ( dft ) exploiting the wien2k package @xcite .",
    "in fact , the importance of model construction of molecular solids based on _ ab - initio _ calculation has recently pointed out in several studies @xcite .",
    "we point out the difference in the band structure and the fermi surface between the _ ab - initio _ ( non - empirical method ) and the extended h@xmath5ckel calculations ( semi - empirical method ) , and its consequence to the superconducting gap mediated by spin fluctuations .",
    "we also study the anion dependence of the band structure , and how it can affect the superconducting transition temperature .",

    "this implements the dft with different possible approximation for the exchange correlation potentials .",
    "the exchange correlation potential is calculated using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "to attain convergence in the eigenvalue calculation , the single - particle wave functions in the interstitial region are expanded by plane waves with a cut - off of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the smallest muffin tin radius and @xmath16 is the maximum value of @xmath17 vector in the plane wave expansion . for @xmath0-(bda - ttp)@xmath9sbf@xmath2 , for instance , the muffin - tin radii are taken as 1.74 , 1.74 , 1.62 , 0.83 , and 0.45 in atomic units ( au ) for sb , f , s , c , and h , respectively .",

    "the on - site @xmath42 in the present study is fixed at a certain value .",
    "although this choice does not have a quantitative basis , taking other values of @xmath42 does not affect qualitatively the conclusion of the present paper regarding the superconducting gap symmetry and the anion dependence of @xmath44 .",
    "note also that we ignore the off - site ( inter - molecule ) repulsive interactions .",
    "this is based on the result obtained in a previous theoretical work for the extended h@xmath5ckel model of the present materials @xcite . there",
    "it has been shown that the introduction of moderate inter - molecule interactions only slightly modifies the position of the nodes of the gap .",

    "the direction of the anisotropy of the fermi surface differs from that found in the previous extended h@xmath5ckel calculation @xcite .",

    "focusing on the comparison of the experiments with our results of the fermi surface , the anisotropy of the fermi surface differs from the previous experiment @xcite , but a very recent amro measurement shows that the long - axis of the fermi surface ellipse is in the @xmath4-b direction , which is at least qualitatively consistent with the present result @xcite .",
    "however , the size of the fermi surface is not consistent between this experiment and the present calculation , and this remains as a puzzle .",
    "now , one of the important issues we study in the present paper is the effect of substituting the anion .",
    "here we consider the anion dependence of the band - width and the dos at the fermi level for @xmath0-(bda - ttp)@xmath1f@xmath2 ( @xmath3=p , as , sb , ta ) at ambient pressure and room temperature , and also for @xmath0-(bda - ttp)@xmath9sbf@xmath2 at 12k . as for the band width , we introduce @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where the former is the energy difference between the top of somo and the bottom of homo , and the latter is the band width of somo alone .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows that @xmath70 becomes smaller as the anion is enlarged from @xmath8p to sb , resulting in an increase of the unit - cell volume .",
    "the trend can naturally be understood as the effect of the chemical pressure .",

    "the correlation between @xmath71 and the volume is not monotonic in contrast to the volume dependence of @xmath70 , even within the pnictogens @xmath8p , as and sb .",
    "the reason for this lies in the small dimerization gap between the somo and homo bands .",
    "even though @xmath71 of @xmath8as is larger than that of @xmath8p , @xmath70 of as is smaller because the dimerization gap of as is smaller than that of p. a schematic figure is shown in the inset of figure [ fig4](b ) , where the left ( right ) figure corresponds to @xmath8p ( as ) .",

    "the volume dependence of the dos at the fermi level , dos(@xmath72 ) , varies in accord with @xmath71 , not @xmath70 , as seen in figure [ fig4](c ) .",
    "it is natural that dos is inversely related to @xmath71 because this directly measures the width of the band that intersects the fermi level , but the point here is that @xmath71 is not directly correlated with @xmath70 and thus the unit cell volume .",

    "this means that the dimerization gap between the somo and homo bands is small in as , hence resulting in a larger @xmath71 despite the smaller @xmath70 .",
    "this is consistent with the qualitative discussion given in subsection [ first principles band calculation ] .",
    "from the viewpoint of the transfer energies , we consider that the difference of the anisotropy of the fermi surface is due to the magnitude of the two - dimensionality , @xmath75 .",
    "our result shows that the average value of @xmath75 over the salts listed in table [ tab1 ] is around 0.46 , which is smaller than that obtained by the extended h@xmath5ckel calculation @xcite .",

    "the spin - singlet superconducting gap function in figure [ fig9](b ) shows that the sign of the gap changes four times along the fermi surface , but the direction of the nodes differs from that of the _ ab - initio _ band model shown in figure [ fig7](c ) . if we consider a wave vector that connects the two gap maxima positions on the fermi surface with different signs of the gap , the vector falls on the broad maximum area in the spin susceptibility as shown in figure[fig9](c ) , indicating that the sign change is indeed due to the repulsive pairing interaction mediated by the spin fluctuations .",
    "we note that the direction of the nodes obtained for this model is in the @xmath12 direction , which is in agreement with the stm measurement @xcite , but not with the in - plane anisotropy of @xmath13 @xcite .",
