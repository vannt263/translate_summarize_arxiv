    "it is well understood that bayesian estimators are well suited to recovery of a coherent joint graphical model , compared to estimators that decompose network inference into independent neighbourhood selection problems @xcite .",

    "a common fault of complex test statistics is that they lack power relative to simpler statistics ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to explore the relative statistical power of existing and proposed performance scores @xmath20 in hypothesis testing , we computed monte carlo @xmath11-values for each network estimate @xmath4 in the dream5 challenge , taking each score in turn as a test function ( see sec .",

    "results for roc - based scores demonstrated a more considerable decrease in statistical power between local and multi - scale test statistics ; it may therefore be prudent to restrict attention to multi - scale results based on pr - scores .",
    "network inference algorithms are increasingly used to facilitate diverse scientific goals , including prediction of single interactions with high precision , identifying motifs such as cliques or clusters , and uncovering global topology such as connected components . yet",
    "performance assessment of these algorithms does not currently distinguish between these contrasting goals ; we do not know which algorithms are most suited to which tasks .",

    "theoretical results demonstrated the potential for local and multi - scale analyses to draw arbitrarily different conclusions .",

    "this work differs to these within - network studies by focussing on the challenge of performance assessment .",
    "the statistical comparison of two unweighted networks has recently been considered by @xcite . in related work , @xcite constructed an _ ad - hoc _ null distribution over residue interaction graphs based on degree - distribution , clustering coefficient , clustering spectrum , average network diameter and spectrum of shortest path lengths . however these are _ mean field _ statistics , which do not respect vertex labels , making their use inappropriate for many scientific applications .",
    "existing and proposed scores capture complementary aspects of performance , so that it is misleading to speak of a universally `` best '' methodology .",
    "mss was specifically designed to capture aspects of higher - order network reconstruction that have been relatively neglected by the community , however in general the existing and proposed scores together still fail to capture many important aspects of estimator performance . in that respect",
    ", this paper represents a small step towards more comprehensive characterisation of estimator performance .",

    "[ times ] . ) given that in practice it may be desirable to restrict attention to a single measure of multi - scale performance , and given that @xmath82 and @xmath106 provide similar statistical power , it may be preferable to favour mss1 over mss2 .    whilst multi - scale analysis has the potential to complement local analyses and deepen our understanding of the applicability and limitations of network inference algorithms ,",
    "there are two commonly encountered settings where multi - scale analyses may actually be preferred over local analyses :    1 .",
    "* time series data : * @xcite and others have noticed that , in the setting of causal graphical models and time series data , the `` true '' causal graph @xmath5 depends crucially on the time scale at which the process is described . to see this , notice that the simple multivariate process defined by the causal graph @xmath5 , equal to @xmath159 and distributions @xmath160 with @xmath161 independent @xmath162 random variables , satisfies @xmath163 with @xmath164 independent @xmath165 random variables .",
    "thus any consistent estimator of a linear gaussian vector autoregressive process will , based on data from even time points only , infer the causal graph @xmath166 equal to @xmath167 . i.e. the apparently natural estimator demonstrates the worst possible performance under @xmath168 .",
    "this is undesirable since it remains the case that all descendancy relationships in @xmath4 are all contained in @xmath5 .",
    "however @xmath4 is readily seen to be @xmath169-optimal , so that the proposed scores are robust to the problem of inappropriate sampling frequency .",
    "real - world examples of this problem arise in the ( frequently encountered ) settings where no natural time scale is available for experimental design , or the sampling frequency is limited by resource constraints .",
    "* interventional experiments : * in experimental settings , network topology is frequently inferred through targeted interventions ( e.g. knock - downs , knock - outs , small molecule inhibitors , monoclonal antibodies etc . ) . differential analysis with respect to a control sample in this case does not reveal the direct children of the interventional target , but rather specifies the descendants of that target .",
    "thus benchmark information is naturally available on descendants , whereas additional experimental work is required to uncover direct edges . in these settings",
    "performance assessment using descendancy ( i.e. mss1 ) rather than using individual edges facilitates a reduction in experimental cost .",
    "this paper focused on the problem of inference for network structure , but an alternative viewpoint is to assess networks by their predictive power @xcite . in this",
    "setting ( a4 ) is replaced by an assumption that estimator weights correspond to effect size ( and may be signed ) . for example",
    "these weights may be average causal effects ( ace ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however this setting is less common as many popular network inference methodologies do not entail a predictive statistical model .",
    "moreover , prediction is often computationally intensive , whereas assessment of the inferred topology is relatively cheap .",
    "this paper lays statistical and conceptual foundations for the analysis of network inference algorithms on multiple scales .",
    "we restricted attention to the important problem of comparing between inference procedures , as in the dream challenges , and proposed novel multi - scale scores ( msss ) for this setting .",
    "an empirical study based on the dream5 data demonstrated that multi - scale analysis provides additional insight into the character and capability of network inference algorithms and suggested that a crowd - source approach to inference may offer improved reconstruction of higher - order topology . in this paper we focussed on connectivity , but",
    "multi - scale scores may be designed to capture ability to infer specific motifs such as cliques , or particular feedback circuits , for example .",
