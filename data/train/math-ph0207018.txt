    "therefore , we can apply the min - max principle   to assure the existence of eigenfunctions of the perturbed problem on @xmath58 .    in a semi - classical picture ,",
    "the number of bound states for high energy levels is approximately given by the phase space volume associated with the classical energy of the quantum system .",
    "the classical hamiltonian on a @xmath59-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the metric on the cotangent bundle @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath66 determines a region in the phase space @xmath64 in which a classical particle with given energy is allowed to move .",
    "the uncertainty principle , however , demands that each bound state requires a cube of volume @xmath67 in phase space , and therefore the total number of bound states is approximately equal to the phase space volume divided by @xmath67 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the weyl asymptotic distribution of the ( dirichlet or neumann ) eigenvalues of the laplacian on @xmath60 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath70 ( see  e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since we expect that the bound states are localized on the perturbed manifold @xmath12 we anticipate that @xmath71 is a lower bound for the eigenvalue counting function",
    ". however , note that @xmath72 in   depends on the manifold @xmath12 . nevertheless in our examples in sections",
    "[ sec : examples ] and  [ sec : non.diffeo ] we show that an infinite number of eigenvalue branches crosses the level @xmath45 from above if the volume of @xmath58 increases . in contrast , if we decrease the volume of @xmath58 , only a finite number of eigenvalue branches cross the level @xmath45 from below . here , by an _",
    "eigenvalue branch _ we mean an eigenvalue of ( one of ) the perturbed manifold(s ) viewed as a function depending on the perturbation parameter @xmath8 .    under the assumptions given above it is not possible to obtain an upper bound on the function @xmath73 . since the dependence on @xmath8",
    "is not supposed to be analytic in assumption  , we could consider a family of metrics @xmath39 which is constant near @xmath74 . if @xmath45 is an eigenvalue of @xmath75 , then @xmath76 .",
    "nevertheless , the examples in sections  [ sec : examples ] and  [ sec : non.diffeo ] in which the eigenvalue branches of the problem on @xmath58 are monotonical should be good candidates where an _ upper _ bound on the counting function @xmath73 in terms of @xmath77 holds ( cf . remarks  [ rem : mono.conf ] ,  [ rem : mono.diff ] and  [ rem : monotonical ] ) .",
    "under suitable further conditions one should have to assure that the eigenvalue branches ( in the gap ) of the _ full _ problem @xmath11 are _ strictly _ monotonical .",
    "note that  in contrast to the approximating problem on @xmath58  the monotonicity of the eigenvalue branches of the _ full _ problem @xmath11 can not be shown by the min - max principle since the gap lies above the infimum of the essential spectrum .",
    "note furthermore that the counting function defined above could be much greater than the _ spectral flow _ of the family @xmath78 at @xmath45 defined as the difference of the eigenvalue branches crossing the level @xmath45 from above and below ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "think for example of an eigenvalue branch which oscillates around @xmath45 .    in  @xcite or  @xcite )",
    "a family @xmath79 is called _ complete _ if for each @xmath80 there exists @xmath56 such that @xmath81 .",
    "note that all our examples given in sections  [ sec : examples ] and  [ sec : non.diffeo ] are complete in this sense ( in proposition  [ prop : conf.shrink ] we have to perturb at least @xmath82 period cells to ensure that @xmath83 for @xmath8 large enough ) .    for the proof of theorem  [ thm : eigenvalues ] we can not directly apply the min - max principle since we consider eigenvalues inside a spectral gap .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following idea given in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or  @xcite to our situation : we show that the eigenfunctions of the full problem on @xmath0 can be approximated by eigenfunctions of an approximating problem on @xmath84 ( cf .  theorem  [ thm : ef.conv ] and theorem  [ thm : count.approx ] ) .",
    "our situation differs from the case given in the papers mentioned above : in some sense it is more complicated since we deal with different hilbert spaces @xmath85 for each @xmath8 . on the other hand , our situation is simpler since there are no extra eigenvalues in the gap coming from the boundary conditions on the approximating problem ( cf .",
    "lemma  [ lem : common.gap ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : prelim ] we provide some notation and basic results on laplacians and periodic manifolds . in section  [ sec :",

    "in section  [ sec : mfd.gaps ] we recall examples of periodic manifolds with spectral gaps .",
    "finally , in sections  [ sec : examples ] and  [ sec : non.diffeo ] we present examples of diffeomorphic and non - homeomorphic perturbations leading to eigenvalues .",
    "throughout this article we study manifolds of dimension @xmath86 . for a riemannian manifold @xmath13 ( compact or not ) without boundary",
