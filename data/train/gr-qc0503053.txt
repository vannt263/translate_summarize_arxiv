    "quantum theory and general relativity are at once practically compatible and theoretically irreconcilable . while there is a profound difficulty in melding the theories , it is not apparent at ordinary scales",
    ". it is expected to become pronounced rather in extreme circumstances , in the planck regime .",
    "the difficulty in reconciling the theories derives from a fundamental incompatibility in their hypotheses . according to quantum theory ,",
    "the position and momentum of an object can never be known simultaneously with unlimited accuracy ; but according to general relativity , we should always be able to imagine space  time populated with locally inertial observers who can make physical measurements to arbitrary accuracy and without disturbing the underlying geometry of space  time . for measurements at ordinary scales , this conflict is utterly insignificant .",
    "but for measurements at very fine scales we must use , according to quantum theory , particles with high momenta . and at some point  the planck threshold  the momenta become so high that their gravitational effects interfere with the measurements being attempted . at such scales",
    "it becomes impossible to give operational significance to ordinary notions of space , time , momentum and energy @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of planckian or `` trans - planckian '' ( past the planck scale ) quantities in a conventional physical theory is a sign it has been applied beyond its realm of credibility .",
    "i shall show here that , when space ",
    "time gravitationally collapses to form a black hole , quantum theory predicts the production of particles at , and the scattering of particles to , planckian energies .",
    "this means the theory predicts its own inapplicability , and the onset of an essentially quantum - gravitational regime , in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "the affected region of space  time extends outwards from the horizon a distance comparable to the size of the hole .",
    "these results do not allow us to say precisely what the quantum - gravitational effects in the vicinities of black holes should be  for that , we would need a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "but we do have an unequivocal prediction that the quantum - gravitational effects should be significant in a substantial volume of space  time .",
    "therefore observations of particles from the vicinities of black holes should be able to provide us with clues about quantum gravity .",
    "the picture that is drawn here is very different from the accepted one ( due to hawking s pioneering analysis @xcite ) , in which black holes are essentially classical objects and quantum corrections to their structure are minor .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that concerns about the accepted theory , which had generally been dismissed as niggling , turn out to be very much on point and to alter the picture significantly .",
    "trans - planckian `` virtual '' effects ( which had been considered an awkward peripheral feature of the conventional theory ) and interactions between quantum fields ( which had been largely neglected ) combine to produce real planckian effects .    a rather different argument , but reaching parallel conclusions , has been given elsewhere  @xcite .    here is the plan of the paper .",
    "sections  [ bh ] and  [ fhr ] review the relevant structure of a gravitationally collapsing space  time and of the hawking process .",
    "they emphasize the origin of the hawking quanta in ultra - high frequency vacuum fluctuations in the distant past ; as the associated virtual quanta propagate through the gravitationally collapsing region they are distorted and red - shifted by an exponentially growing factor .",
    "since they emerge with frequencies of the order of the characteristic hawking frequency , the precursors frequencies grow exponentially .",
    "section  [ ei ] contains the computation of the effect of interactions , in the case of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "i show there that there is a non - trivial first - order amplitude to produce electron ",
    "positron pairs , at the exponentially growing energies associated with the hawking quanta s precursors .",
    "one can think of the process as being due to the quantum - electrodynamic dressing of the vacuum by virtual triples , each consisting of a photon and an electron ",
    "positron pair . for an ultra - energetic such triple ,",
    "the photon may pass through the collapse region and be distorted to a hawking quantum which can no longer recombine with the electron ",
    "positron pair to produce the proper dressing of the vacuum .",
    "the result is a real hawking photon together with a real ultra - energetic electron ",
    "positron pair .",
    "section  [ cp ] discusses the consequences of the analysis .",
    "the exponential growth in the energy scales means that one very quickly passes the regime in which reliable theoretical computations of quantum - field - theoretic processes are possible , and in a few dozen @xmath0-foldings has arrived at the planck regime , where the entire theory breaks down .",
    "thus our main conclusion is that current theory is unable to make reliable predictions about quantum physics in the neighborhood of a black hole .",
    "indeed , we suggest that observations of the vicinities of black holes may be able to provide us with evidence of the behavior of quantum field theories at ultra - high energies and the character of quantum gravity .",
    "_ conventions and terminology .",
    "_ we shall use natural units , so @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are unity .",
    "we shall need to discuss processes with energies approaching , but not at , the planck energy ; we shall refer to these as ultra - energetic . for simplicity , in most of the paper",
    "we consider only an isolated uncharged spherically symmetric black hole ; we shall explain that the results here hold too for holes with angular momentum and charge .",
    "] its mass will be @xmath4 .",
    "conventions for quantum fields are those of schweber  @xcite .",
    "while the event horizon of a black hole is best known as a `` point of no return , '' it is a different property which is most important both in hawking s analysis and here .",
    "this is that light rays ( and other fields ) passing close to the event horizon are red - shifted , the shifts increasing exponentially as later and later rays are considered .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a diagram in which the past and future limits of the light rays can be represented . in order to do this",
    ", we distort the scales so that these limits appear at finite positions on the diagram .",
    "it is possible to do this while retaining an accurate representation of causal relations .",
    "this is done in fig .  1 , which suppresses the angular variables and thus represents the radial and temporal degrees of freedom",
    ". the spatial origin is at the left - hand edge , and radial light rays are at @xmath5 .",
    "the event horizon is the dashed line , and the points at and above this form the black hole itself .",
    "the future limits of radial light rays are on the upper line at @xmath5 , coordinatized by the `` retarded time '' @xmath6 , and denoted collectively @xmath7 .",
    "( similarly , the past limits are coordinatized by `` advanced time '' @xmath8 and denoted @xmath9 . )",
    "one should think of the neighborhood of @xmath7 as the locations of observers far from the collapsing object who look back into the space  time with @xmath6 their appropriate measure of time .",
    "( the neighborhood of @xmath9 is the set of locations of distant actors who might send signals into the space  time . )",
    "these external observers are , by definition , everywhere below the event horizon .",
    "this means that later and later external observers appear , in fig .  1 , to crowd the upper - right corner",
    "this is only the effect of the distortion of scales , however ; the corresponding portion of space ",
    "time is in reality unbounded .",
    "similarly , the set @xmath7 is really unbounded in the past ( that is , towards the right - hand corner in fig .  1 ) ,",
    "and the set @xmath9 is likewise really unbounded .",
    "an observer at a retarded time @xmath6 near @xmath7 , looking inwards , would see a radial light ray . tracing this ray backwards in time , it would move inwards to the spatial origin , pass through this ( appearing , in the diagram , to reflect from the left - hand edge ) , and emerge finally at an advanced time @xmath10 on @xmath9 ( dotted line in fig",
    "the periods @xmath11 and @xmath12 of a light ray at @xmath9 and @xmath7 are related by @xmath13 , so @xmath14 is the red - shift suffered by the ray .",
    "the red - shift factor @xmath14 plays a key role in quantum physics around black holes .",
    "it can be shown to have the asymptotic form @xmath15 where @xmath4 is the mass of the hole @xcite .",
    "this exponential decay drives @xmath14 to zero very quickly .",
    "( for example , for a solar - mass object , the @xmath0-folding time is @xmath16 s. ) although observers in the exterior of the black hole ( by definition ) never cross the event horizon and so never , strictly speaking , see the hole , the nominal time of formation of the hole may be taken as the point where @xmath14 has decreased to become practically indistinguishable from zero .",
    "because the uncertainty principle forbids measuring all degrees of freedom of a quantum field simultaneously , one can never speak of a state of identically zero field .",
    "this means that even in a space  time unaffected by gravity the vacuum is populated by quantum fluctuations in the field , sometimes called zero - point fluctuations .",
    "while they do not contribute any real particles to the state , they can have significant indirect effects .",
    "the lowest - order vacuum fluctuations in the absence of gravity are represented in feynman - type diagrams by closed loops ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "these loops suggest particles coming into existence and annihilating themselves .",
    "while this is not wholly correct  the use of the term `` particle '' in this context is oversimplistic , and the loops do not have any distinguished points at which one can say creation or annihilation occurs  it will not be necessary for us to refine this . in general , intermediate `` particles ''",
    "are called `` virtual '' .",
    "( while its literal significance will not be needed here , fig .",
    "2 corresponds to the effect of zero - point energy on the propagation of the field .",
    "this effect can be consistently subtracted when there is no explicit time - dependence , and in those cases diagrams like fig .",
    "2 can be neglected and are rarely drawn . )    in principle , according to quantum field theory , vacuum fluctuations occur for all field modes , including those of arbitrarily high frequencies , corresponding to virtual particles of arbitrarily high energies .",
    "this would be a problem if the effects of arbitrarily high - energy fluctuations had always to be considered , because quantum field theory itself should break down at the planck scale and quantum gravity should take over .",
    "however , in realistic theories , for any given process , there is an energy scale beyond which the fluctuations decouple and can be ignored .",
    "as long as this energy is below the planck scale there is no trouble .",
    "we shall see , however , that hawking s model requires the use of virtual particles at arbitrarily high energies , and so its reliance on conventional quantum field theory is inappropriate .    when the quantum fields propagate through a time - dependent region of space  time , they are distorted and the balance of the vacuum fluctuations is upset .",
    "this is what , in hawking s analysis , gives rise to thermal radiation .",
    "we can represent this by drawing feynman - type diagrams on top of space ",
    "time diagrams , as in fig .  3 .",
    "in these diagrams , one can think of the effect of the passage through space  time as opening some of the vacuum fluctuation loops .",
    "the results are real particles emitted , and those which escape to @xmath7 are the hawking radiation .",
    "although virtual particles can propagate throughout space  time , only certain vacuum fluctuations propagated in particular ways will be distorted in the correct manner to give rise to significant real particle production .",
    "the most important contributions to the hawking process come from modes like those shown in fig .",
    "these originate as vacuum fluctuations in the past , propagate inwards , pass through the origin and then move outwards to @xmath7 just before the event horizon . hawking s prediction of thermal radiation , although not originally expressed diagrammatically , is equivalent to the evaluation of diagrams like fig .",
    "3 , and hawking s remarkable insight was ( again , recast in diagrammatic form ) that the main contributions would come from the modes shown there .",
    "the red - shift of the fluctuations as they propagate through space  time and reify is crucial .",
    "the predicted frequencies of the hawking particles are @xmath17 . however , these frequencies have been red - shifted from those of their vacuum - fluctuation precursors .",
    "the precursors frequencies must have been @xmath18 .",
    "so the precursors  which should be thought of as the portion of fig .  3 around and including the semicircular portion at the lower right",
    " have frequencies which grow exponentially and rapidly reach the planck scale .",
    "then quantum - gravitational effects must take over .",
    "this is the `` trans - planckian problem '' @xcite .",
    "the prediction of thermal radiation relies on assuming that conventional physics applies to vacuum fluctuations at exponentially increasing energy scales .",
    "the scales rapidly pass the planck threshold , at which quantum - gravitational effects must supplant conventional physics .",
    "the conventional analysis @xcite ignores this , and uses vacuum fluctuations at the exponentially increasing , trans - planckian , scales . for us , however , the ultra - energetic portion of fig .  3 will be of central significance .",
    "hawking s analysis rested on several assumptions , one of which was that interactions between quantum fields could be neglected . to my knowledge , there has been no attempt to trace through the essential logic of the analysis while taking interactions into account . and",
    "yet this is surely worthwhile , for , while interacting quantum field theories are admittedly difficult , they are well understood ( at least perturbatively ) .",
    "we shall consider for definiteness quantum electrodynamics , the theory of photons , electrons and positrons , but it will be apparent that the main ideas are more general . because the coupling is weak , in most familiar situations , it is legitimate to treat this theory as a perturbation of a `` bare '' theory of noninteracting photons and charged particles .",
    "the interaction is determined by the vertex in fig .  4 , which may represent scattering of a charged particle by a photon , or a pair of charged particles converting to or from a photon .",
    "we shall see that the perturbation theory in the presence of gravitational collapse is qualitatively different from that in minkowski space , and that this difference becomes apparent at first order ( in the electric charge ) . at this order",
    ", we might expect to draw diagrams like fig .  5 , which ( intuitively , at least ) would represent the production of a pair of charged particles , together with a hawking - type photon , by a vacuum fluctuation .",
    "a diagram like this would vanish in minkowski space , by conservation of energy ",
    "momentum , but in a gravitationally collapsing space ",
    "time some of the energy ",
    "momentum may be exchanged with the incipient black hole .",
    "we shall see that this diagram has a non - zero value , and in fact represents the pair production of ultra - energetic charged particles .",
    "we shall now make this precise .",
    "however , we shall do so in terms of conventional operator - theoretic methods , rather than feynman - type diagrams .",
    "( there is no standard definition of such diagrams in curved space  time , and making one and carefully connecting it with conventional field theory would be lengthy ; also the operator - theoretic treatment is better suited to some aspects of the discussion . )",
    "it should be emphasized that our goal here is to clearly establish the existence of real ultra - energetic effects .",
    "it is not to make quantitatively accurate estimates of them in very general circumstances , or even to discuss the variety of different possible effects . while such estimates and discussion are of interest in themselves , they are not of primary interest in the present work .",
    "this is because , once we know that real ultra - energetic effects exist , the exponentially increasing energies quickly move the effects beyond those which can be reliably computed .",
    "the main point of showing that the effects are real is to show that the theory itself breaks down .",
    "we shall therefore choose to examine a particular situation in which the effects are revealed with a minimum of computational and interpretational technicalities .",
    "this will be the main point of subsection  [ comp ] , below .",
    "first , however , we must understand what the physical vacuum is in the interacting case .",
    "it will be crucial to understand how the vacuum is altered when the interaction is `` switched on . ''",
    "the vacuum in question is the in - vacuum , defined as the state of lowest energy in the distant past . in this regime",
    ", we shall assume that space  time , at least exterior to the collapsing body , is to good approximation stationary ( in fact , in the case we are considering , spherical symmetry and vacuum exterior force it to be exactly schwarzschild in this region ) .",
    "then we may write the hamiltonian in the past as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the `` bare , '' noninteracting , term and @xmath21 is the interaction . according to standard perturbation theory ,",
    "the bare in - vacuum @xmath22 is perturbed to first order to a `` dressed '' vacuum @xmath23 the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath24 , where the integration is over the initial surface in question , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electromagnetic and charged - particle field operators .",
    "each of these operators is a sum of ( bare ) creation and annihilation terms .",
    "combinations involving annihilation terms will not contribute to the perturbation of the vacuum , but those involving creation terms from @xmath27 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 will .",
    "this is one way of understanding how the interaction populates the vacuum with virtual quanta .",
    "while , as emphasized above , our computation will be in operator - theoretic terms and will not rely on diagrams , the diagrams do provide a useful intuitive picture , and we shall begin by explaining the connection between the quantity to be computed and them .",
    "we shall compute an amplitude which can be thought of as corresponding to the diagram in fig .",
    "our point of view is that this diagram is a modification of the conventional hawking process , where one branch of the electromagnetic line has been converted to an electron ",
    "positron pair .",
    "thus the diagram represents the _ destruction _ of a hawking electromagnetic quantum ( relative to the in - vacuum  recall that the in - vacuum is the state which has hawking quanta in the out - region ) and the creation of a charged - particle pair .",
    "we may write the amplitude as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are annihilation and creation operators in the distant future , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 are mode labels .    in order to simplify the analysis , we shall choose to examine the amplitude  ( [ expval ] ) only for certain modes .",
    "most importantly , the charged - particle modes will be restricted so that to zeroth order they correspond to wavepackets propagating everywhere throughout the vacuum region .",
    "this means that to zeroth order the charged - particle modes are unaffected by the dynamic , collapse , portion of the space  time .",
    "( in particular , we do not then have to consider hawking - production of charged particles , for hawking - produced particles appear to emanate from the collapsing region . )",
    "it will also be convenient to consider only modes corresponding to propagations everywhere far from the strong - field region .",
    "this is not really essential , but allows us to use a conventional momentum - space representation of the field operators .    with these restrictions on the modes to be examined",
    ", the amplitude  ( [ expval ] ) vanishes to zeroth order , because the charged - particle field @xmath35 annihilates the quantum state in this order .",
    "we shall see , however , that there are non - trivial first - order effects .",
    "there are two sorts of first - order contributions to the amplitude  ( [ expval ] ) : those where the first - order correction is to one of the operators ; and those where it is to the state vector .",
    "as it turns out , those due to corrections to the operators do not produce very significant effects .",
    "( the reason for this is essentially the same as in minkowski space .",
    "the corrections due to the perturbations of the operators are @xmath36 where in each case the subscript `` b '' denotes the bare term and the prefix @xmath37 the first - order correction . of these ,",
    "the latter two vanish since the charged - particle annihilation operator is applied to the vacuum ; we are left with @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath6 are the mode functions for the fields , determined from their data in the future and propagated through space ",
    "time by the free field equations , and the integration extends over the space ",
    "time volume in question .",
    "if the mode functions correspond to particle wavepackets sufficiently well - localized that the volume in which there is a significant interaction is small compared to the space  time curvature , then in this volume the interaction must conserve energy  momentum . in this interaction volume , both the electromagnetic and electron  positron mode functions can be thought of as on - shell modes in minkowski space .",
    "the electron ",
    "positron mode functions will correspond to a superposition of terms , each with timelike future - pointing energy  momentum .",
    "the electromagnetic mode functions , on the other hand , will be a superposition of terms each with null energy  momentum .",
    "it will therefore be impossible for energy  momentum to be conserved : the interaction integral will vanish due to destructive interference . )    the interesting first - order contributions to the quantity  ( [ expval ] ) come from the perturbation of the vacuum . in principle , there are two of these , one from the perturbation of the bra and the other from the perturbation of the ket , but the first of these vanishes as in it annihilation operators are applied directly to the bare vacuum .",
    "we have , therefore , @xmath41 to the approximation required , where the field operators may be taken to be bare .",
    "we should , strictly speaking , do the details of the computation with wave - packets to represent the mode functions determining the fields .",
    "however , as is conventional , we shall work directly with the momentum - space representations of the fields , and understand that the computation really only has meaning when averaged over appropriate wave - packets ( corresponding to the assumptions we have made about the modes we consider ) .",
    "we shall therefore take the mode labels @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 to refer to three - momenta in the out - region .",
    "( we will supplement these with polarizations shortly . ) since to zeroth order the spinor field modes of interest for us are unaffected by the space  time curvature ,",
    "it is not necessary to distinguish , to this order , the momentum - space decomposition of the spinor fields in the future from that in the past .",
    "however , for the electromagnetic field this distinction is essential .",
    "we shall put @xmath42\\ , d^3l\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are called the bogoliubov coefficients of the ( zeroth order ) scattering .",
    "we may now straightforwardly compute the amplitude  ( [ expval ] ) : @xmath45 ^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times     \\langle 0_{\\rm b}|{\\tilde\\psi}^+(k ' ) \\overline{\\beta ( k , l)}\\phi ^+_{\\rm p } ( l ) \\psi ^+(k'')h_{\\rm int}|0_{\\rm b}\\rangle\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the energy of a particle of mass @xmath47 and momentum @xmath32 .",
    "we have @xmath48 , and when we compute the expectation @xmath49 , the annihilation operators applied to the fields in @xmath21 simply produce the corresponding mode functions . with standard continuum normalizations for these ( the operator @xmath50 corresponding to the mode @xmath51 , the operator @xmath52 to @xmath53 and @xmath54 to @xmath55 , where we have written the polarizations @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 explicitly ) we find , after a short calculation , @xmath59 ^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\tilde{v } ( k'')\\gamma^b \\overline{\\beta _ { ab}(k ,- k'-k'')}\\epsilon ^a(k ) v(k ' ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have written the index structure on the bogoliubov coefficient and the photon polarization explicitly .",
    "the interpretation of the evaluated amplitude  ( [ evamp ] ) turns on the behavior of the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath44 .",
    "this coefficient was evaluated by hawking ; indeed , its evaluation was the main goal of his work , for the probability of producing hawking photons in mode @xmath33 is @xmath60 .    hawking found that the quantities were controlled by the characteristic frequency scale @xmath61 ( where @xmath4 is the mass of the collapsing object ) .",
    "associated with this is a characteristic period @xmath62 . in any epoch ( interval of late time",
    "a few characteristic periods in duration ) , the main contributions to @xmath44 come from wavenumbers @xmath33 of magnitude @xmath63 but with @xmath64 the corresponding , blue - shifted , precursor . thus the magnitude of @xmath64 is @xmath65 and it is directed inwards .    here , we have @xmath66 with @xmath32 , @xmath34 the momenta of the charged particles .",
    "thus we have ultra - high momenta @xmath67 directed _",
    "outward_. this is our amplitude to produce ultra - energetic pairs .",
    "the corresponding probability , being proportional to @xmath68 ( modulo polarization effects ) , can be thought of as representing the conversion of a fraction of hawking quanta into these pairs .",
    "it is natural to ask what the implications of this result are for late times @xmath6 .",
    "however , once the momenta @xmath32 , @xmath34 have become ultra - relativistic ( that is , @xmath69 ) , first - order perturbation theory is no longer valid ; one must take higher - order corrections into account .",
    "it is beyond the range of our present computational abilities to make accurate evaluations of the amplitudes when @xmath6 increases very much .",
    "increases . on the one hand ,",
    "the blue - shifting of the modes goes on in a region of space  time which is itself being exponentially compressed ; this tends to decrease the amplitudes exponentially . on the other , as the energies increase one has more possible processes contributing to a given amplitude ; estimates of this effect are speculative .",
    "] indeed , the point of view we shall advocate is that the computation here shows that non - trivial ultra - energetic effects are possible , but it is unrealistic at present to expect to be able to make quantitative theoretic predictions of them .",
    "rather , it may be that we shall learn experimentally the physics of ultra - energetic quantum fields by observing signals from the vicinities of black holes .",
    "there is no wholly satisfactory brief account of the physics underlying this ultra - energetic pair production , because of the interpretational difficulties present in any interacting quantum field theory .",
    "however , the effect is important enough that some discussion is certainly in order .    one way of understanding the physics is to realize that `` dressing '' a state does not commute with evolution through a time - dependent potential ( here , the gravitational collapse ) .",
    "the in - vacuum , as we have seen , can be thought of as a bare vacuum `` dressed '' by the contributions of interactions .",
    "this dressing was determined by the hamiltonian @xmath70 in the distant past , where the state was specified , by the requirement that the state indeed be the one of lowest energy .",
    "by contrast , consider a physical out - state with a thermal distribution of photons .",
    "this state is , to zeroth order , the one described by hawking . however , if we wish to dress this state and retain its physical interpretation , we must do so on the basis of the hamiltonian @xmath71 in the distant future .",
    "( the dressed thermal state could be defined by requiring that the kms condition with respect to @xmath71 hold . )",
    "this hamiltonian differs substantially from @xmath70 , in that the electromagnetic potential operators of the two are related by a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the bare in - state dressed by @xmath70 will not evolve to the bare out - state dressed by @xmath71 . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the situation in more detail .",
    "the in - vacuum was modified by the addition of triples of ( bare ) quanta .",
    "each of these triples consists of an electromagnetic quantum and a pair of charged quanta .",
    "while the spatial momenta of each triple sum to zero , contributions with arbitrarily high individual momenta are present .",
    "the field modes describing these triples , after passage through the collapsing region , are distorted .",
    "we here neglect the distortion of the charged - particle modes ( we are interested only in charged particles which are everywhere far from the collapse region ) .",
    "but the photon modes are very severely distorted .",
    "each photon mode which passes through the collapse region is exponentially red - shifted ; also the photon field modes undergo a squeezing transformation ( mixing positive and negative frequencies ) which alters the particle numbers .",
    "this means that the field modes in the future can not recombine undistorted to dress the bare out - state as would be prescribed by @xmath71 .",
    "the out - state will thus have an ultra - high frequency content which differs from that of the bare out - state dressed by @xmath71 : there will be ultra - energetic excitations . and these distortions will be due to missing inward - directed photons , leaving outward - directed charged - particle pairs .    the discussion just given points up a subtlety in dealing with interacting field theories",
    " one must be careful to distinguish between bare and dressed quantities , and in general one must be careful to justify the physical interpretations of the quantities . in our case , we have worked out the amplitude  ( [ expval ] ) , which in principle exists in full quantum electrodynamics , to lowest non - trivial order . we are thus justified in identifying it as a physically significant quantity .",
    "it is true that its simple interpretation in terms of particles is only valid insofar as we may identify the operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 as annihilation and creation operators for particles , and this becomes a non - trivial issue for very high energies .",
    "however , the problem of defining the particle - content is not really relevant here .",
    "what matters is that the amplitude unambiguously represents ultra - energetic excitations of the charged fields .    in this connection",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the amplitude  ( [ evamp ] ) we have computed would vanish in a stationary space ",
    "time ( assuming the positive-/negative - frequency decomposition of fields is with respect to killing vector defining the stationarity ) , for then the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath72 would be zero .",
    "thus if one wishes to view the amplitude as a certain three - point function , the difference of this function between the case of gravitational collapse and the stationary case is a clear signal of the effect of gravitational collapse on the physics .    finally , we point out that similar results will hold for holes with angular momentum and charge .",
    "we really only used the schwarzschild character of the hole in two places : when we assumed the bogolibubov coefficients were those of a schwarzschild hole ; and in estimating the magnitude of the momentum @xmath64 as @xmath73 .",
    "however , it is well understood what these quantities are in the more general , kerr ",
    "newman , case .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficents were discussed by hawking , and the momentum increases as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the surface gravity of the hole .",
    "we chose to compute the amplitude for pair production because it was simple both technically and conceptually .",
    "technically , it was a first - order process in which only one term contributed significantly .",
    "conceptually , it had a clear interpretation , as the first - order contribution to an expectation - value which should exist in full , non - linear quantum electrodynamics .",
    "many other processes could be investigated , and similar conclusions reached",
    ". however , the results are harder computationally and are also subject to further interpretational complications ( largely associated with renormalization ) .",
    "it should be clear , however , that not only production of ultra - energetic pairs , but also the scattering of particles initially present to ultra - high energies is possible .",
    "( some processes would simply be by virtual photon exchange with the ultra - energetic pairs described here . )",
    "there are also corrections to vacuum polarization effects , where a virtual photon can pass through the collapsing region .",
    "we shall not attempt to discuss any of these here .",
    "the main point of the present paper is that the exponential increase of the energies quickly carries us beyond the point where we can make reliable quantum - field - theoretic computations .",
    "we have seen that when interactions are taken into account , quantum field theory in curved space  time leads to a very different picture of a black hole than the one drawn by hawking . instead of an essentially classical object accompanied by the emission of low - energy ( @xmath76 ) thermal quanta , we have a prediction of emissions at exponentially increasing energy scales ( @xmath77 ) , where the @xmath0-folding time ( @xmath78 s , with @xmath79 the mass of the sun ) is fairly short for known black - hole candidates .",
    "this has consequences for the general theoretical picture ( the link between black holes and thermodynamics ) and possibly for experiment as well .",
    "too , we must divide the discussion into the _ cis - planckian _ regime , where the energies involved are below the planck scale , and the planckian regime .      while the computations above have been done only for one quantum - electrodynamic process and only to first order , it should be clear that the underlying principle is more general : the passage of virtual quanta through the collapsing region distorts them significantly and so upsets the balance of virtual processes , resulting in real effects which become ultra - energetic . the energy scale for these increases as @xmath73 .    typically , these effects at a given point are due to contributions from the blue - shifted precursors of hawking photons .",
    "of all the photons that might be visible at a point , hawking photons should come from ( roughly ) that fraction of the sky occupied by the incipient black hole .",
    "this fraction will be appreciable for observers within a few schwarzschild radii of the hole , and will fall off as the square of the distance from the hole at greater distances .",
    "thus we may expect significant effects in a volume of space whose radius is a few schwarzschild radii , and possibly measurable effects some distance further out .",
    "one would like to know the rate of production of ultra - energetic particles .",
    "unfortunately , the exponential increase of the energies makes reliable computations of this first difficult , and then impossible . the first - order quantum - electrodynamic computation done above",
    "would be expected to be valid for energies @xmath80  mev ( beyond which higher - order effects , due to further real and virtual electron  positron pairs , would have to be considered ) . above about @xmath81  mev",
    "one would have to consider meson production and associated strong - force physics ; above about @xmath82  gev there would be baryon production ; above about @xmath81 gev , electroweak mixing . and much beyond this , we are in a regime in which we have few experimental data and theory is very much a matter of speculation .",
    "it should be pointed out that there are essentially two competing effects determining how significant a particular ultra - energetic amplitude is .",
    "on one hand , the exponential compression of the modes takes place in a region of space  time which is itself being exponentially compressed ( its extent in advanced time is of the order of the blue - shifted period ) , and this tends to decrease the amplitude . on the other , as the energies increase one has the potential of more processes contributing to a given amplitude , as well ( perhaps ) as the break - down of perturbation theory itself .",
    "we have no good ways of estimating these latter effects , and thus we have no good way of estimating how much radiation is produced",
    ". we can not even say whether the total production would tend to increase or decrease with @xmath6 .",
    "we do know , however , that the characteristic energy scale increases exponentially .    while this difficulty in making quantitative predictions is a very real one , we also have the exciting prospect of the neighborhood of a black hole being an experimental laboratory in which energies well beyond those terrestrially accessible will appear . and",
    "while the quantitative estimates of the rate of production are at present unavailable , it is worth noting that there would be one general characteristic of the effects described here which would distinguish them from other high - energy astrophysical effects in the neighborhood of the hole .",
    "the energies of the effects here would be set essentially by the red - shift factor @xmath14 , and not the distance from the hole ( except for additional red - shift effects very near the hole ) .",
    "( the _ probabilities _ of the effects would fall with the distance , as noted above , but the energies would not . ) by contrast , most highly energetic astrophysical effects near a black hole are driven by loss of potential energy , and so the energies involved vary inversely with the distance from the hole .    as noted above , the exponential increase in the energy scales",
    "means that this regime of cis - planckian physics is run through in short order , typically a few dozen @xmath0-foldings .",
    "one might think that this means that only if we catch a black hole on the verge of formation is this cis - planckian regime accessible .",
    "this is not the case , however . what matters is the increasing blue - shift of the frequencies , and such an increase can occur in other ways .",
    "for example , it may occur for an observer moving relative to an established black hole , if as time passes in the observer s frame there is a direction in which there are null geodesics passing closer and closer to the hole .",
    "it may also occur if matter accretes to an existing black hole  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that besides providing a window on physics at very high energies , the effects here would provide some constraints on very low energies .",
    "this is because they rely , like the original hawking computation , on the assumption that there is an effectively massless field ( the photon , in the work above ) .",
    "here `` effectively '' massless means much lower in mass than the scale @xmath83 .",
    "since the photon s mass is presently believed constrained to be @xmath84  ev @xcite and @xmath85  ev ( where @xmath79 is the mass of the sun ) , a non - zero photon mass could cause a difference in the production of ultra - energetic effects by black holes of masses @xmath86 .",
    "finally , in this connection we note that neutrinos of masses below @xmath87 could also contribute to ultra - energetic effects in manners similar to that of the photon ; current experiments only constrain the mass of the lightest neutrino to be @xmath88  ev .",
    "the most interesting feature of the analysis here is that it unequivocally demonstrates the inadequacy of conventional quantum theory in curved space ",
    "time to describe physics in the neighborhood of a black hole .",
    "that conventional theory would predict the existence of effects at energies increasing exponentially beyond the planck scale , and at that point the neglect of quantum - gravitational effects is illegitimate . without a theory of quantum gravity ,",
    "we can not say how this conventional model breaks down  whether it is conventional quantum theory which becomes inadequate , or the treatment of space ",
    "time by a classical model , or both  but we do know that one of these elements must be altered .    in particular , we can not say whether an established black hole ( one for which the energy scale in question has entered the planck regime ) will emit quanta at all , in any frequency range .",
    "we can not even say whether the quantum structure of the hole and its neighborhood will be effectively stationary or not . because of the appearance of the planck scale , the problem is wholly dependent on quantum - gravitational physics ,",
    "not presently understood .",
    "the simplest hypothesis would be that , whatever the details of the quantum - gravitational structure are , they result in the emission of particles at energies somewhat below the planck energy .",
    "( of course , without a theory of quantum gravity , we could say nothing about the production rates for different species . )",
    "if this is correct , and the cut - off is independent of position , then , as in the cis - planckian case , the limiting energy would be essentially independent of distance from the hole ( apart from possible red - shift effects for particles very near the hole ) , although the probability of emission would fall with distance from the hole .",
    "again , this would be a signature likely to distinguish these effects from other ultra - energetic astrophysical effects near the hole . and again",
    ", with our present ignorance of the physics of the extreme energy scales involved , we can only speculate about the sorts of particles that might be produced .",
    "it is possible that this mechanism is responsible for the production of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .    for established black holes , besides the possibility of direct observation of particle emission , there are other potentially significant astrophysical consequences .",
    "whatever hypotheses on the rate of particle production are made , the rate of mass loss for the hole is likely to be different from that predicted by hawking , leading to a different black - hole lifetime .",
    "these differences could have significance for cosmological models , since density fluctuations in the early universe may have produced black holes .",
    "up to now , the main constraints on the number of these have been due to the cosmological implications of hawking radiation .",
    "a difference in the predicted radiation would alter these constraints .",
    "the results here , besides showing the necessity of developing some aspects of a theory of quantum gravity for the treatment of quantum fields near black holes , imply that we must reconsider the picture that has been broadly accepted of quantum theory and black - hole thermodynamics .",
    "let us recall that , before the theory of black - hole radiance , a strong formal parallel had been noted between the theory of black holes and thermodynamics .",
    "the zeroth law ( the existence of a well - defined temperature ) was the fact that the surface gravity of a stationary black hole was constant over the horizon ; the first law was conservation of energy ; and the second was that the area of a black hole could only increase .",
    "thus it seemed that one should interpret the surface gravity and area of a black hole as a sort of temperature and entropy , respectively .",
    "the relation remained only formal , however , until an explicit link with ordinary thermodynamics could be found .",
    "such a link was first proposed by bekenstein  @xcite , based on the notion of information loss .",
    "this argument was however difficult to make completely quantitatively precise .",
    "then hawking predicted that black holes actually radiate thermally with a well - defined temperature @xmath83 ( which turns out to be the surface gravity over @xmath89 ) .",
    "this seemed to explain one half of the puzzle , that of giving a thermodynamic meaning to the black - hole temperature .",
    "it was also true that from that result and the thermodynamic relation @xmath90 a definite value for the black - hole entropy could be inferred , but the problem of providing a convincing independent thermodynamic interpretation for black - hole entropy remained open . and",
    "despite much ingenious work ( e.g. , attempts to count the number of black - hole states quantum - gravitationally , thought - experiments based on having ordinary thermal systems interact with black holes ) , the problem is still open  @xcite .",
    "the results here call into question the prediction of black - hole radiation , and with that the explanation of black - hole temperature .",
    "they do not , as emphasized above , mean that black holes do not radiate , but they do make the previous analysis untenable .",
    "their real lesson is that the regime in question can not be understood at all without quantum gravity .",
    "we may thus summarize our picture as follows .",
    "the black hole has an essentially quantum character , with significant ultra - energetic quantum effects in a region extending on the order of a schwarzschild radius beyond the hole . as the hole forms , the energy scales in question increase exponentially , making the neighborhood of the incipient hole a potential laboratory for studying quantum fields at all energy scales .",
    "( such increasing energy scales may also be obtained for established holes , for observers moving relative to them or when matter accretes onto them . ) after a finite number of @xmath0-foldings , however , the energy scales have reached the planck regime , and we are at the limit of known physics . at this point , the neighborhood of the hole has an essentially quantum - gravitational structure .",
    "we may hope that studies of black holes may bring experimental evidence for the character of this structure .",
    "the main argument of this paper has been that the effects of interactions among quantum fields substantially alter their physics in a gravitationally collapsing space  time .",
    "this differs from most previous thinking ; i shall here briefly discuss the relation of the ideas here to previous work on interactions .",
    "probably the bulk of the work that has been done has grown out of attempts to model hawking - radiating mini black holes whose temperatures are high enough to make them astrophysically interesting . however , to my knowledge , all such work is based on the _ assumption _ that the black hole acts as a black ( or brown ) body of a given size and temperature .",
    "thus this approach _ assumes _ that a hawking - type result applies even for interacting fields ; it does not attempt to justify this result .",
    "there has also been the suggestion , not fully developed , that general principles of quantum field theory and invariance should force a black hole to radiate thermally even when quantum - theoretic nonlinearities are present  @xcite .",
    "the main support for this notion comes from the bisognano ",
    "wichmann theorem , which can be interpreted as stating that a uniformly accelerating observer in minkowski space would perceive the @xmath91point functions of the vacuum of even an interacting field theory to be the same as those of a thermal state at the corresponding unruh temperature .",
    "however , it has so far not been possible to develop a theorem like this in the gravitational - collapse case .",
    "( the bisognano ",
    "wichmann theorem is very much a result of _",
    "special_-relativistic field theory , and in particular depends crucially on the existence of a semi - bounded self - adjoint hamiltonian , a hypothesis which is invalid in the gravitational - collapse region  @xcite . )    perhaps the best attempt to confront the problem of interactions has been due to gibbons and perry  @xcite .",
    "these authors outlined an argument that the feynman propagators for the theory would have a periodicity in imaginary time which would enforce thermality of the state even in the case of interactions .",
    "however , there are some subtleties which make it difficult to completely prosecute the argument .",
    "the details of the development of the theory by feynman diagrams , and especially the question of the choice of dressing of the in- and out - states , were not spelled out .",
    "also , while one of the authors main points was the necessity of showing that an initially vacuum state would dynamically equilibrate to a thermal one , in fact it is unrealistically hard to follow this dynamical process , and so they based the details of their analysis on the use of the hartle  hawking propagator  @xcite .",
    "this is a somewhat formal object usually interpreted as representing a black hole _ assumed _ in equilibrium with a thermal bath of radiation .",
    "it is an object which _ by construction _ has no explicit information about a collapse phase ; it was derived , and is most often used , under the assumption that one is dealing with late - time physics for which neglect of the collapse phase is legitimate .",
    "thus the gibbons  perry analysis would not uncover the sorts of effects investigated here , which turn on the propagation of virtual quanta from before the time of collapse through the collapse region ."
