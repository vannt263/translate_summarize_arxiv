    "occurrence of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) has been extensively discussed since there are many lines of evidence for direct and causal relationship between them .",
    "lirgs predominantly emit at far infrared ( fir ) , and the infrared ( ir ) luminosities at 81000  @xmath1 m , @xmath4 , amount to @xmath5 log @xmath4 ( l@xmath6 ) @xmath7 by definition @xcite .",
    "although bulk of the energy in lirgs is due to intense star formation activity @xcite , agns are often found among lirgs .",
    "also , a significant fraction of lirgs are tidally interacting objects .",
    "the fraction of agn - dominated sources is known to be higher in lirgs with larger ir luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in later interaction stages @xcite .    both mid - infrared ( mir ) and",
    "x - ray studies are very effective to reveal nuclear activities in lirgs .",
    "although lirgs , in particular their nuclei , are often heavily absorbed at optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , both mir and hard x - ray photons can penetrate through such interstellar medium .",
    "we can study agn indications at mir because agns typically show characteristic power - law - like spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which often shows an excess at mir over the sed from warm and cold dusts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "various kinds of agn diagnostics have been developed at mir , and empirical assessments of relative agn contribution to the entire system have been made @xcite .",
    "we can also study typical agns at x - ray because agns show luminous and characteristic power - law spectra , the hard part of which suffers from less absorption by circum - agn material .",
    "therefore , x - ray has been heavily utilized to study agn in lirgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  3256 is the most luminous lirg in the local universe ( @xmath8 ) . at a distance of 35",

    "it is also among the most luminous x - ray sources without a confirmed agn in the local universe @xcite .",
    "it is a major merging system showing tidally distorted morphology at galaxy scale with tidal tails , disturbed outer spiral arms , and prominent dust lanes with complex morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "its double nuclei , often referred to as northern and southern nuclei ( hereafter , n and s nuclei , respectively ) are separated by only 5  ( 850  pc ) .",
    "they are clearly visible at both radio and mir ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the s nucleus is hidden in dust at the optical .",
    "the merger is likely in the late stage just before coalescence of the nuclei @xcite .",
    "the n nucleus is a core of a starburst galaxy .",
    "its optical spectrum shows h  ii region - like features . extended outflowing ionized gas with shocks is also detected and attributed to a superwind powered by the starburst @xcite .",
    "stellar population examined in @xmath17 band indicates young starburst population @xcite .",

    ".    presence of an agn at the optically obscured s nucleus has been suspected for a long time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but there is still no firm evidence for it .",
    "dust lanes cover the s nucleus and make it invisible at optical and nir wavelengths below @xmath17 band .",
    "a compact ( unresolved at 05 fwhm ) and moderately absorbed ( neutral hydrogen column density @xmath18 @xmath19 ) x - ray source was detected with _ chandra _ at this nucleus @xcite .",
    "although it looks much fainter ( by at least two orders of magnitude ) than expected for a classical seyfert nucleus given its mir luminosity , it is brighter than expected for typical starburst galaxies ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the mir sed extracted within a kpc - scale aperture ( including both nuclei and the host galaxy component ) indicated that agn contribution to the total mir luminosity is @xmath20% @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently discovered a bipolar collimated jet - like molecular - gas outflow from the s nucleus , and argued that it is likely driven by an agn .    due to its proximity",
    ", ngc  3256 is among the best targets to examine the characteristics and roles of agn , if any , within a lirg system .",
    "for this purpose , it is essential to verify the presence of an agn in the s nucleus using spatially resolved and/or sensitive mir and x - ray observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent spatially - resolved mir spectroscopies revealed some interesting differences between the two nuclei . by using the slit - scanning spectroscopy data taken with the _ spitzer _ irs @xcite",
    ", @xcite noted that the s nucleus shows deeper silicate absorption at 9.7  @xmath1 m , stronger h@xmath21 lines , and a slightly smaller equivalent width ( ew ) of pah 6.2  @xmath1 m than those at the n nucleus .",
    "more dramatic differences are found in ground - based spectra obtained with higher - spatial resolution .",
    "the silicate absorption is much deeper and the pah features are undetectably weaker at 036 ( 61  pc ) scale at the s nucleus than in the irs spectrum @xcite .",
    "at x - ray , @xcite reported that the point - like source at the s nucleus is more heavily absorbed than other point sources and the diffuse component within the galaxy . in this work we utilize archival and published data of _ spitzer _ , _ hst _ , and _",
    "chandra _ to analyze the nuclear spectrophotometry more comprehensively than ever to explore an agn in the s nucleus .",
    "we examined _ spitzer _ irac @xcite archival images of ngc  3256 at its four channels for morphological and photometric studies .",
    "although @xcite ( see also @xcite ) published the irac images and provided nuclear photometries , they did not use the 8.0  @xmath1 m channel image in their analysis because it is slightly saturated at around the n nucleus .",
    "the 8.0  @xmath1 m information is helpful in conjunction with information of the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  @xmath1 m channels to create irac color - color diagrams for agn diagnostics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , the images were taken under the hdr ( high dynamic range ) mode in which both short- and long - exposure frames are taken within an astronomical observation request ( aor ) .",
    "the short - exposure frame is not saturated at the n nucleus .",
    "we retrieved the post basic - calibrated data ( post bcd or pbcd ) of standard mapping observations ( aor : 3896832 ; pi : g. fazio ) from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive .",
    "this is the same data set of @xcite .",
    "for the 8.0  @xmath1 m channel , since short - exposure frames are not recommended for science use in general ( irac data handling book ) , we confirmed flux calibration consistency between the long- and short - exposure frames using photometry of field stars .",
    "then the saturated pixels at around the n nucleus in the long - exposure frame were substituted with corresponding pixels in the short - exposure frame image .",
    "for the 4.5  @xmath1 m channel , additional simple sky subtraction was made to correct for its tilted background .",
    "as shown by @xcite for the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  @xmath1 m channels , the two compact nuclei are clearly separated in all four channels ( figure  [ fig_morphology ] ) .",
    "aperture photometry was made on each nucleus with our idl program ( table  [ tab_irac_flux ] ) .",
    "we used an aperture of 28 diameter for the photometry , and applied aperture correction following @xcite .",
    "flux contribution from the host galaxy is estimated within a concentric annulus whose inner and outer radii are 20 and 26 , respectively .",
    "the size of the annulus was set as small as possible to estimate the flux level near the nucleus by minimizing the effect of host galaxy structure .",
    "standard deviation within the annulus is quadratically added to the statistical error of the flux measurement of the nuclei .",
    "although our fluxes are systematically slightly fainter than those of @xcite , the two are consistent because @xcite performed simple aperture photometry with slightly larger apertures than ours ( 36 , 36 , and 40 diameter apertures for the 3.6  @xmath1 m , 4.5  @xmath1 m , and 5.8  @xmath1 m images , respectively ) .",
    "we note that n nucleus has only about 7% , 7% , 6% , and 7% , and the s nucleus has about 4% , 9% , 4% , and 2% in 3.6  @xmath1 m , 4.5  @xmath1 m , 5.8  @xmath1 m , and 8.0  @xmath1 m channels , respectively , of the flux integrated over the entire galaxy reported by @xcite .",
    "flux ratio maps were also made for 4.5  @xmath1m/3.6  @xmath1 m , 5.8  @xmath1m/4.5  @xmath1 m , and 8.0  @xmath1m/5.8  @xmath1 m ( figure  [ fig_ratioimage ] ) . the point spread function ( psf ) size matching was made for these ratio maps using a bright field star as a reference .",
    "the measured psf fwhm is about 2.9 pixel or 17 .",
    "we processed our own irs spectra so that the spectrophotometry was done in a way consistent with the corresponding irac photometry for each nucleus , although similar spectra had been already published @xcite .",
    "we used the same irs mapping data set of @xcite and @xcite , and followed almost the same processing methods as adopted in the earlier studies .",
    "the bcd data ( aor : 17659904 ; pi : g. rieke ) of the short - low ( sl ) module were retrieved from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive .",
    "similar mapping data with other modules ( long - low ( ll ) , long - high ( lh ) , and short - high ( sh ) ) were not used since spatial resolution was worse for the longer wavelength data .",
    "they are not suitable for our analysis in which separating the two nuclei is essential .",
    "the standard cubism data processing @xcite was made , including background subtraction , hot / rogue pixel identification and subtraction , and cube creation .",
    "aperture photometry was made with our idl program to extract spectra for each nucleus on the data cubes created with cubism ( figure  [ fig_irac_irs_sed ] ) .",
    "we fixed an aperture size of 36 diameter over 5.214.5  @xmath1 m and applied the aperture correction .",
    "flux contribution from the host galaxy is estimated within a concentric annulus whose inner and outer radii are 20 and 26 , respectively .",
    "the size of the annulus was set as small as possible to estimate flux level near the nucleus by minimizing the effect of host galaxy structure .",
    "however , since the irs spatial resolution ( @xmath22  fwhm ) is larger than that of irac and is comparable to the distance to another nucleus ( @xmath235 ) , we carefully applied masks to hide another nuclear component in the annulus .",
    "standard deviation within the annulus is quadratically added to the statistical error of the flux measurement of the nuclei .",
    "the aperture correction factor was measured with a mapping observation of a standard star , hr  7341 .",
    "the standard star data ( aor 19324160 ) taken in the same observing campaign of the ngc  3256 observation were retrieved from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive , and they were reduced by cubism with exactly the same parameters .",
    "we then measured the star with the same photometry program and aperture settings , and found the aperture correction factor by comparing the measured spectrum with the standard - star flux information from the irs instrument handbook .",
    "as in the case of the irac photometry , those nuclear spectrophotometries are about 1220% of that over the entire galaxy ( 134 @xmath24 13 4 ; @xcite ) , although the overall spectral shapes look similar , i.e. , all show prominent pah 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3  @xmath1 m features and fine structure lines such as [ ne  ii ] .",
    "we confirmed characteristics reported earlier by @xcite , namely brighter h@xmath21 fluxes , deeper silicate absorption at 9.7  @xmath1 m , and smaller ew of pah 6.2  @xmath1 m at the s nucleus ( see  [ infrared_agn_signature_results ] below for our silicate absorption depth measurements ) .",
    "the irs nuclear photometries are about two times larger than the irac 5.8  @xmath1 m and 8.0  @xmath1 m nuclear photometries at both nuclei ( figure  [ fig_irac_irs_sed ] ) , and we interpret this as a result of more contamination from the host component due to larger psf of irs .",
    "therefore , in order to combine the irs and irac spectrophotometries in a consistent way for our subsequent analyses , we adjusted the irac nuclear photometries for the irs resolution in the following way . for the n nucleus , we simply scaled the observed nuclear irac fluxes by a factor measured at both 5.8  @xmath1 m and 8.0  @xmath1 m channels by comparing with synthetic irac fluxes from the irs spectrum .",
    "we utilized a standard photometry tool ( spitzer_synthphot.pro ) from _ spitzer _ data analysis cookbook . since the irs sl module can not fully cover the irac 5.8  @xmath1 m bandpass between 4.9 and 5.2  @xmath1 m , we extrapolated the spectra shortward a little with a help of scaled swire ngc  6090 sed template ( see  [ infrared_agn_signature_results ] below for more details about the template ) .",
    "we found that a single scaling factor on the irac n nuclear fluxes satisfies matching both 5.8  @xmath1 m and 8.0  @xmath1 m fluxes with the irs - synthetic photometries , and the factor is applied to all four irac channel fluxes .",
    "for the s nucleus , we added scaled irac fluxes at the n nucleus to the fluxes at the s nucleus to match irs - synthetic photometries at the s nucleus .",
    "here we utilized the fact that colors of the n nucleus are very similar to those in the surrounding region of the s nucleus ( figure  [ fig_ratioimage ] ) .",
    "we calculated the scaling factor by considering , again , both 5.8  @xmath1 m and 8.0  @xmath1 m fluxes .",
    "we found that a single scaling factor satisfies matching fluxes in both channels , and applied the factor to all four irac channels .",
    "the adjusted irac fluxes for each nucleus are also shown in table  [ tab_irac_flux ] .",
    "note that the adjusted fluxes are used only for analyzing mir sed together with irs .",
    "the @xmath25-band high - spatial low - spectral resolution spectrophotometry of the s nucleus taken by @xcite shows remarkably different signatures just on the nucleus , and we therefore include the data in our analysis . the spectrum was taken with t - recs at the gemini - south telescope through a 036-wide slit under 035 fwhm seeing condition , providing the best spatial resolution at @xmath25 band owing to both the diffraction - limited 8  m telescope and the seeing - matched narrow slit .",
    "the spectrum is extracted over 036 ( or four pixel width ) around the peak at the s nucleus .",
    "@xcite performed flux calibration by a standard star observation while considering the slit loss effect , and we further applied the aperture correction to estimate the flux of the central compact source by compensating loss of photons outside the extraction aperture box . by assuming a gaussian psf of the seeing size , we estimated and multiplied a factor of 1.30 on the original data presented by @xcite in their figure  3 .",
    "since error of the spectrum is not explicitly given , we estimated it from a scatter of the data points around the fitted model profile ( see figure  3 of @xcite ) .      in order to extend the shorter wavelength coverage of the nuclear spectrophotometries",
    ", we also analyzed high - resolution _ hst _ nicmos images at nir .",
    "we retrieved the combined nic3 images of f110w ( 1.1  @xmath1 m wide band ) , f160w ( 1.6  @xmath1 m wide band ) , and f222 m ( 2.2  @xmath1 m medium - wide band ) from the _ hubble _ legacy archive .",
    "the nic3 camera provides a larger field - of - view and is good for comparison with the irac images .",
    "their spatial resolutions ( psf size in fwhm ) are 026 for all three bands .",
    "flux measurement is based on standard flux conversion factors for the instrument and the filter from the nicmos handbook .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images presented by @xcite and @xcite are from a different data set taken with the nic2 camera of the nicmos instrument .",
    "a small correction of tilted background was made for each filter image by fitting the image with a tilted plane while masking sources for each filter band .",
    "astrometry is corrected with three bright field stars in the 2mass catalog outside of the galaxy , and the global accuracy is about 02 .",
    "the f160w and f222 m images are shown along with the irac images in figure  [ fig_morphology ] .",
    "zoom - up images of all three filters around the s nucleus are also shown in figure  [ fig_nicmos_snuc ] .",
    "a compact source marginally appears on the f222 m image , although it is blended with surrounding structures .",
    "this source is not clearly identified in f160w and f110w . for more nicmos images for other lines / bands and their descriptions ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_morphology ] compares overall morphology of the galaxy in all irac channels and nicmos f160w and f222 m images . in general , irac channels ( in particular the longer 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m channels ) trace star - forming regions and the nicmos bands trace stellar population .",
    "the n nucleus is bright and distinct in all irac channels .",
    "the s nucleus is barely visible at 2.2  @xmath1 m and is more evident in the irac channels .",
    "the n nucleus is brighter than the s nucleus at 3.6 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath1 m , while the two nuclei are comparable at 4.5  @xmath1 m .",
    "such characteristics were noted for 2.2 , 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  @xmath1 m by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed that both nuclei are equally bright at @xmath26 band ( 3.6  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the flux ratios at the s nucleus are remarkably different from the rest due to a compact red source at the s nucleus .",
    "the s nucleus shows larger 2.2  @xmath1m/1.6  @xmath1 m and 4.5  @xmath1m/3.6  @xmath1 m , and smaller 5.8  @xmath1m/4.5  @xmath1 m flux ratios than those of the n nucleus and most of the host galaxy ( figure  [ fig_ratioimage ] ) .",
    "the large - scale dust lanes known around the s nucleus in the optical wavelengths @xcite are not visible in the mir flux ratio maps .",
    "the red s nucleus stands out even more in the _ hst _ data when the stellar component with complex morphology is subtracted .",
    "we modeled the stellar component of the host galaxy in the f222 m band using f160w and f110w images .",
    "first we measured stellar colors at each pixel by using the two images , and we then synthesized the stellar f222 m image by linearly extrapolating from the f160w image by considering the stellar colors .",
    "we scaled the synthesized image by a factor of 0.74 to match the observed f222 m image at well outside of the s nucleus .",
    "this correction factor is probably due to color corrections on the filters for very red stellar continuum along with the heavy dust lanes around the s nucleus @xcite .",
    "we found a distinct compact peak at the s nucleus on the f222 m image subtracted for its synthetic stellar component ( figure  [ fig_nicmos_snuc ] ) , indicating an additional component at the s nucleus .",
    "this compact source coincides with the red peak in the f222m / f160w image , a radio continuum source at the s nucleus ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a compact ( at 030 fwhm resolution ) 8.74  @xmath1 m continuum source at the s nucleus @xcite .",
    "the red compact source at the s nucleus contains an unresolved ( at 026 fwhm , or 44 pc ) core .",
    "we fitted the source with one and two circular gaussian components . in the single - gaussian model",
    ", we found a systematic radial variation in the residual map in a sense that the center has a compact positive residual peak and the surrounding region systematically shows negative residuals . in the double - gaussian model , we assumed that the two gaussian components share the same center position and that the more compact component is unresolved ( at 026 fwhm ) .",
    "the residual map has much less systematic structure compared with the single - gaussian model .",
    "the reduced @xmath27 are 1.8 and 1.0 for the single- and double - gaussian models , respectively .",
    "therefore , the double - gaussian model with an unresolved core is preferred .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table  [ tab_nicmos_measurement ] .",
    "the two nuclei are basically similar to each other in the irs spectra , but we found their noticeable differences .",
    "the irs spectra of both nuclei show prominent pah and mild silicate absorption features as well as some fine structure lines ( figure  [ fig_irac_irs_sed ] ) .",
    "such characteristics are common to lirgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we compare the observations with the starburst irs template of @xcite , which was generated by averaging irs spectra of local starburst galaxies . since this template is taken with exactly the same instrument and module ( sl )",
    ", we can directly compare it with our observations .",
    "although the template reproduces the observations rather well , we found two notable differences between them .",
    "one is the depth of the @xmath28  @xmath1 m silicate absorption , which is characterized by @xmath29 . here , @xmath30 is a continuum flux at 9.7  @xmath1 m estimated following @xcite .",
    "we measured @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for the n nucleus , s nucleus , and the irs starburst template , respectively .",
    "the s nucleus shows significantly deeper absorption than the n nucleus , which shows similar depth within uncertainty as the starburst template .",
    "we note that the n nucleus shows slightly smaller @xmath34 than the template , although the observed 9.7  @xmath1 m flux at the n nucleus is larger than the template scaled at 6.08.0  @xmath1 m ( figure  [ fig_irac_irs_sed ] ) .",
    "this is because the n nucleus also shows higher continuum at @xmath35  @xmath1 m than the scaled template due to systematically redder color at @xmath36  @xmath1 m , and the estimated continuum level at 9.7  @xmath1 m is also higher for the n nucleus .",
    "another difference is the color at @xmath37  @xmath1 m .",
    "ratio of our irs observations to the starburst template ( figure  [ fig_irs_irac_ratio ] ) shows a steep excess at the s nucleus below @xmath38  @xmath1 m , reaching about data - to - template ratio of @xmath39 at @xmath40  @xmath1 m .",
    "the n nucleus does not show such a systematic deviation from the template .",
    "we also compare the observations with a starburst - powered lirg sed template of ngc  6090 ( log @xmath4 ( @xmath41 ; @xcite ) from @xcite ( figure  [ fig_irac_irs_sed ] ) .",
    "the template was generated to fit the observations with the grasil code @xcite , which is a physical starburst evolution model for estimating seds .",
    "although this template also roughly resembles the spectra of two nuclei , it seems closer to the n nucleus at @xmath0  @xmath1 m .",
    "the irac seds further illustrate the difference between the two nuclei ( figure  [ fig_irac_irs_sed ] ) . at the s nucleus , the irac flux monotonically increases toward longer wavelengths , i.e. , no flux drop is found at 4.5  @xmath1 m . at the n nucleus ,",
    "the irac 3.64.5  @xmath1 m color is almost flat , indicating a contribution from the stellar component , which has a blue color at @xmath42  @xmath1 m ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the slope between 4.5  @xmath1 m and 8.0  @xmath1 m is steeper ( redder ) at the n nucleus than at the s nucleus .",
    "an excess flux at 4.5  @xmath1 m at the s nucleus causes such differences .    by utilizing irac color - color diagrams for agn diagnostics",
    ", we found that the s nucleus shows agn - like sed at 3.68.0  @xmath1 m ( figure  [ fig_irac_color_color ] ) .",
    "two types of such diagrams have been developed for agn diagnostics .",
    "one is based on flux ratios of 5.8  @xmath1m/3.6  @xmath1 m vs. 8.0  @xmath1m/4.5  @xmath1 m originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "we take color boundaries for agn selection from @xcite , who modified the flux ratio cut of 5.8  @xmath1m/3.6  @xmath1 m from the original one .",
    "another is based on 5.8  @xmath1m-8.0  @xmath1 m and 3.6  @xmath1m-4.5  @xmath1 m colors ( in magnitudes ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "although the same irac flux information is used in both plots , they are not completely consistent in identifying photometric agn candidates .",
    "the irac colors at the s nucleus are in the area for agns , which include seds of pure power - law and hot blackbody of 3001000  k. the n nucleus is closer in the irac colors to starburst - dominated sources ( either spiral galaxies , starbursts , or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ) .",
    "the difference in colors can be again interpreted as due to 4.5  @xmath1 m excess at the s nucleus .",
    "it is very likely that the s nucleus is composed of multiple components with different characteristics .",
    "this is because the spectrum of the s nucleus at 036 scale is remarkably different from the spectra at arcsec resolution @xcite . within the 036 aperture ,",
    "the s nucleus shows much deeper silicate absorption without detectable pah .",
    "the pah features are evident in the irs at @xmath43  scale ( @xcite , this work ) , the wider - slit t - recs ( 13-wide ; @xcite ) , and the timmi2 ( 12-wide ; @xcite ) spectra .",
    "this difference is probably because circumnuclear star - forming regions dominate the mir flux within the larger apertures . in terms of flux level , all the larger - aperture spectrophotometries are comparable to our irac 8.0  @xmath1 m nuclear photometry , but the t - recs 8.0  @xmath1 m flux within the 036 aperture is as small as 30% of the irac flux .",
    "we constructed simple composite sed models for the s nucleus with and without agn to examine how additional agn contribution can better reproduce the mir observations compared to a pure ( but absorbed ) starburst model .",
    "we fitted the models to both the high spatial - resolution t - recs spectrum , in particular its deep silicate absorption , and the nuclear irac and irs spectrophotometries , in particular its prominent pah features . for simplicity ,",
    "only two components are in the composites .",
    "one of them needs to be compact and heavily absorbed to reproduce the very deep silicate absorption of the t - recs spectrum .",
    "another one represents the extended circumnuclear star - forming region which appears to dominate the pah feature .",
    "we made two such composite models .",
    "the agn - starburst composite model assumes a heavily absorbed agn in addition to surrounding star - forming regions at @xmath43  scale .",
    "the starburst - starburst composite model assumes heavily and mildly absorbed starburst regions .",
    "emission from the heated dusts associated with the compact and heavily absorbed starburst component is not considered in the fitting . as a reference",
    ", we also constructed a single - component absorbed starburst model without an agn .",
    "although @xcite already did similar but more sophisticated sed modeling over the whole aperture irs spectrum , ours is improved in the following three points .",
    "firstly , we include the irac 4.5  @xmath1 m flux , below the irs wavelength coverage , in the fitting so that the bluer sed at @xmath0  @xmath1 m of the s nucleus can be clearly traced .",
    "the irac 3.6  @xmath1 m flux is not included in the fitting because the flux is usually contaminated by stellar emission and relative contribution of the stellar component with respect to non - stellar component varies from one star - forming region to another .",
    "secondly , we utilize the nuclear spectrophotometry .",
    "@xcite used a very large aperture irs spectrum that includes both nuclei and their surroundings .",
    "given the only mild differences between the n and s nuclei at the irs spatial resolution (  [ infrared_agn_signature_results ] ) , it is essential to separately analyze the nuclear spectra .",
    "thirdly , we require our model to fit the high - spatial - resolution t - recs spectrum while simultaneously fitting the irac and irs spectrophotometry .",
    "we fit the t - recs spectrum at 8.012.9  @xmath1 m (  [ trecs_data_analysis ] ) and the irac 4.5  @xmath1m  irs spectrophotometries at 4.514.5  @xmath1 m (  [ irac_iras_fluxmatch ] ) . for reference",
    ", we also fit only the irs spectra ( 5.214.5  @xmath1 m ) to evaluate the effect of including the irac 4.5  @xmath1 m photometry .",
    "we employed a standard @xmath27 minimization technique implemented in the mpfit software package @xcite . for the starburst component",
    ", we adopt the lirg sed template of ngc  6090 from @xcite since the irs starburst template of @xcite does not completely cover the irac 4.5  @xmath1 m channel . for the agn component , we adopt a pure power - law sed ( @xmath44 ) with a power - law index ( @xmath45 ) of @xmath46 .",
    "the colors / flux ratios of this sed are well within the expected ones for agns ( figure  [ fig_irac_color_color ] ) , and , as we show later , this intrinsically bluer power - law fits the observed irac sed when heavily extinct to fit the deep silicate feature of the t - recs spectrum . for the extinction curve ,",
    "we adopt three different types and compare the results because , as we demonstrate later , a slight difference in silicate absorption profile can result in quite different best - fit parameters with similarly good statistics for the same t - recs data .",
    "this strongly affects our fit to the irac and irs data covering wider wavelengths .",
    "we can not identify more appropriate extinction curve without having good anchor point(s ) of the fit away from the very deep silicate absorption . due to the same problem",
    ", we fit the two sets of spectrophotometry data one by one because fit to the t - recs spectrum at 8.012.9  @xmath1 m hardly constrains our fit around 4.5  @xmath1 m on the irac and irs spectrophotometries . therefore",
    ", we first fit the t - recs spectrum with each of the three extinction curves by two sed models ( either starburst or agn ) . during the fit",
    ", we fix the redshift , and fit the sed scaling factor and extinction ( represented by optical depth at 9.7@xmath3 m , @xmath47 ) .",
    "we then subtract the fitted model from the irac and irs data , and fit the residual spectra with the starburst sed by using the same extinction curve .",
    "we again fix the redshift , and fit the sed scaling factor and @xmath47 .",
    "we assume a screen geometry for both components .",
    "we do not consider an effect of radiation from heated dust , although such a radiation is expected for a compact dusty region surrounding the central energy sources ( either starburst or agn ) .",
    "we employ the following three extinction curves in the fitting .",
    "the first one is a theoretical extinction curve of @xcite ( hereafter , ct06 ) for the galactic center .",
    "the second is from a spectral fitting code pahfit @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced a hybrid curve consisting of an observed 9.7  @xmath1 m silicate absorption profile , an empirical 18  @xmath1 m silicate absorption profile , and a power - law component .",
    "the 9.7  @xmath1 m silicate feature is taken from @xcite based on the observation toward the galactic center .",
    "this curve is found to work very well on irs spectra of normal and star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ; see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the third one uses the same function of pahfit but with a different parameter set to reproduce the updated extinction curve toward the galactic center by @xcite .",
    "the curve of @xcite shows stronger silicate absorption than that of ct06 , although both curves are for the galactic center . for our fitting purpose , we modified parameters of the pahfit extinction curve to reproduce the very high - resolution extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "we set the power - law slope of the continuum extinction curve zero , and relative strength of the power - law component with respect to the 9.7  @xmath1 m silicate feature strength ( @xmath48 ; @xcite ) 0.155 . because the extinction curve of @xcite is almost proportional to that of ct06 below the silicate feature",
    ", we replaced short side of the extinction curve ( @xmath49  @xmath1 m ) with the scaled curve of ct06 .",
    "this gives smaller @xmath50 ( 5.8 ) than that of ct06 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the three extinction curves are compared in figure  [ fig_extinction_curve ] .",
    "results of the fits are summarized in figure  [ fig_sedmodeling ] and table  [ tab_sed_fitting_results ] .",
    "as we show below , the original pahfit extinction curve gives much poorer fits , therefore the best - fit sed models are not shown with this curve in figure  [ fig_sedmodeling ] .      in the absorbed single - starburst model ( figure  [ fig_sedmodeling ] top ) , we modeled the irac 4.5  @xmath1m  irs spectrophotometry of the s nucleus only with the absorbed lirg sed template .",
    "although the model reproduces the irs spectrum reasonably well , neither the 4.5  @xmath1 m excess nor deep silicate absorption at the 036 scale can be reproduced .",
    "reduced @xmath27 are about 46 for all three extinction curves , and the irac 4.5  @xmath1 m flux contributes most to the @xmath27 .      in the agn - starburst composite model ( figure  [ fig_sedmodeling ] middle ) , we found a good fit , although not statistically satisfactory , to the t - recs spectrum with the agn template by using the extinction curve of ct06 ( reduced @xmath52 ) and our modified pahfit extinction curve ( reduced @xmath53 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the original pahfit extinction curve gives poor fit ( reduced @xmath54 ) because the curve always produces asymmetric extinction at both ends of the silicate absorption profile , while the observed profile is more symmetric than the curve .",
    "we note that the best - fit parameters are significantly different for different extinction curves ( @xmath55=9.4 and 12.7 for the extinction curve of ct06 and our modified pahfit extinction curve , respectively ) .",
    "as explained earlier , this is due to slightly different profile of the silicate absorption feature and absence of fit anchor point(s ) outside the feature . for the fit to the irac 4.5  @xmath1m  irs spectrophotometers , both extinction curve of ct06 ( reduced @xmath52 ) and our modified pahfit extinction curve ( reduced @xmath56 ) resulted in @xmath570.7 .",
    "we note that the irac 4.5  @xmath1 m flux dominates the @xmath27 in a fit with the extinction curve of ct06 in a sense that the fit under - predicts the observation .      in the starburst - starburst composite model ( figure  [ fig_sedmodeling ] bottom ) , we found that a heavily absorbed lirg sed also fits the t - recs spectrum ( reduced @xmath53 for the extinction curve of ct06 and our modified pahfit extinction curve ) .",
    "this is because the silicate absorption profile of the extinction curve essentially dominates the shape of the absorbed sed within the t - recs wavelength coverage .",
    "again , the original pahfit extinction curve gives poor fit ( reduced @xmath58 ) because of the same reason for the case of the agn - starburst composite model .",
    "the fits to the irac 4.5  @xmath1m  irs spectrophotometries ( reduced @xmath596 ) are much worse than those of the agn - starburst composite model ( reduced @xmath601.4 ) , because contribution to the 4.5  @xmath1 m flux from the heavily absorbed lirg template is negligibly small .",
    "we found that the agn - starburst composite model fits the mir observations much better than the starburst - starburst composite model since agn contribution can reproduce the 4.5  @xmath1 m excess .",
    "in particular , the modified pahfit extinction curve gives better fit to the 4.5  @xmath1 m flux , and we prefer the results with this extinction curve , i.e. , figure  [ fig_sedmodeling ] right - middle .",
    "this model can also roughly explain the nicmos 2.2  @xmath1 m flux of the unresolved nuclear component , although the flux is not included in the fit ( figure  [ fig_sedmodeling_best ] ) .",
    "in our best - fit model with the modified pahfit extinction curve , the agn contributes @xmath61% and @xmath62% of the 6 and 24  @xmath1 m fluxes , respectively . as for the optical depth on the agn component , we use both results , @xmath63 and @xmath64 from the extinction curve of ct06 and our modified pahfit extinction curve , respectively , and adopt the possible range of the optical depth of @xmath6513 , since the two extinction curves provide statistically equally good fit to the t - recs spectrum .",
    "we estimate the column density toward the agn to be on the order of @xmath66 @xmath19 .",
    "we assumed a screen geometry of the dusty region .",
    "the optical depth at 9.7  @xmath1 m over the agn continuum , @xmath6513 , corresponds to @xmath67 mag by using the conversion factors of @xmath68/@xmath69 and @xmath70 for extinction curves of ct06 and our modified pahfit , respectively . further assuming a standard conversion factor for the solar neighborhood , @xmath71/@xmath72 @xmath19 mag@xmath10 @xcite , the neutral hydrogen column density toward the agn is estimated to be @xmath73 @xmath19 .",
    "we can also estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) and ir luminosity of the s nucleus . by subtracting the synthetic 8.0@xmath3 m flux of the agn component ( 16  mjy ) , we estimate 8  @xmath1 m flux from the starburst component of our best agn - starburst composite model is 35  mjy .",
    "we then estimate sfr to be 0.43 m@xmath74 yr@xmath10 by using calibration of @xcite , which is derived for young ( 10100  myr continuous burst ) starburst with salpeter initial mass function ( 0.1100 m@xmath74 ) based on ir ( 81000  @xmath1 m ) luminosity  sfr conversion and monochromatic 8  @xmath1 m luminosity  ir luminosity correlation .",
    "this sfr corresponds to @xmath75 l@xmath74 .",
    "@xcite noted that correlation between mir and ir luminosities are essentially the same for agn - starburst composite galaxies , agns , and star - forming galaxies .",
    "therefore , the ir luminosities of the agn and the s nucleus , including the agn and the circumnuclear starburst component , are estimated to be @xmath76 l@xmath74 and @xmath77 l@xmath74 , respectively l@xmath74 , @xmath78 l@xmath74 , and @xmath79 l@xmath74 for the n nucleus , the s nucleus , and the agn in the s nucleus , respectively . during the revision of this paper , we revised the numbers as shown here . ] .",
    "we note that the agn luminosity is highly uncertain because the correlation between the mir and ir luminosities is established for field agns found in a blank - sky survey @xcite , and it is not clear if the same correlation applies to the heavily absorbed agn at the s nucleus . for comparison ,",
    "the ir luminosity of the n nucleus estimated in the same way from the observed 8.0@xmath3 m flux is @xmath78 l@xmath74 .",
    "the total infrared luminosity at 31100  @xmath1 m ( tir ) of the n nucleus is also estimated from the whole - aperture tir luminosity by @xcite , who used both irac and mips @xcite 24  @xmath1 m , 70  @xmath1 m , and 160  @xmath1 m fluxes .",
    "since the irac colors of the n nucleus are very similar to that of the rest of the galaxy , and the s nucleus that shows distinct colors consists of only a few percent of the whole aperture flux (  [ irac_data_analysis ] ) , we scale the whole - aperture tir luminosity according to the nuclear fluxes at 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "we then found @xmath80(2.02.4 ) @xmath81 l@xmath74 for the n nucleus .",
    "we analyzed archival data of two _ chandra _ observations of ngc  3256 to search for x - ray indications of the presence of an agn in the s nucleus .",

    "the resulting exposure times after discarding high background intervals are 16.2 and 27.2  ksec for the first and second observations , respectively , totaling @xmath82 times more exposure time than that in @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectra of the s nucleus were extracted using a circular region with a radius of 2.2 pixels or 11 .",

    "the net counts after the background subtraction are shown in table  [ tab_chandra_log ] and the background subtracted spectra are presented in figure  [ chandra_spec ] .",
    "the spectra of the s nucleus were binned so that each bin contains at least one count .",
    "spectral fits were performed by using xspec version 12.8.2 .",
    "we applied a maximum likelihood method to fit the spectra using the modified version of @xmath83 statistic @xcite , in which a poisson distribution is assumed for numbers of counts in each bin .",
    "while the absolute value of @xmath83 does not provide goodness of fits , @xmath84 can be used to examine relative goodness or to generate confidence intervals .",
    "the errors are at the 90% confidence range for one parameter of interest ( @xmath85 ) .",

    "an apparently flat spectrum is often explained by a reflection dominated spectrum or a combination of heavily absorbed and lightly absorbed continua , and these possibilities are tested below .",
    "the former case is expected if the primary x - ray emission is obscured by a large amount of matter exceeding a column density of @xmath89 @xmath19 and if emission scattered by medium surrounding the x - ray source dominates observed spectra . in oder to represent a spectrum dominated by reflection by cold matter , the pexrav model @xcite in xspec modified by intrinsic absorption was used .",
    "the incident spectrum was assumed to be power law with an exponential high energy cutoff .",
    "the photon index and the cutoff energy were fixed at 1.8 and 300 kev , respectively , since these parameters were not well constrained from the observed spectra .",
    "a reflector of a slab shape with an inclination angle of 60@xmath90 was assumed , where 0@xmath90 corresponds to face on .",
    "the abundance of the reflector was assumed to be solar , where the abundance table of @xcite was used .",

    "another possibility to explain the very flat continuum is a multicomponent model consisting of heavily and lightly absorbed continua .",

    "if the primary source is hidden behind optically thick matter with a column density greater than @xmath132 @xmath19 and the observed spectrum is dominated by emission scattered by cold matter , the resulting spectrum becomes very hard .",

    "the observed spectra , however , do not show an indication of fe - k emission line , and the upper limit on the ew is 190 ev ( for model c ) .",
    "this limit is inconsistent with a reflection dominated spectrum and the presence of a compton - thick nucleus is ruled out .",

    "the fraction , @xmath135 , of the continuum absorbed by a large column density ( @xmath136 @xmath19 ) is in the range typically observed in seyfert 2s @xcite .",

    "the luminosity in the 210 kev band corrected for absorption is estimated to be @xmath138 erg s@xmath10 .",

    "this luminosity is in the range for low - luminosity agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "note that we assumed an eddington luminosity of @xmath144 erg s@xmath10 for one solar mass , which is based on an assumption of a hydrogen - to - helium ratio of 0.76:0.23 by weight .",
    "the bolometric correction factor @xmath145 is known to be dependent on a luminosity and an eddington ratio .",

    "the x - ray fluxes of the s nucleus for the two observations with a 3 year interval are consistent with each other within errors . a systematic analysis of agn x - ray light curves of a large sample shows that a high percentage of low - luminosity agn do not show significant variability @xcite , and the absence of variability is consistent with x - ray emission being from a low - luminosity agn . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of variability might be explained by the possibility that the x - ray emission comes from multiple sources . if there are tens of stellar mass black holes well within the size of the psf of _ chandra _ ( 049 or 83  pc at the distance of ngc  3256 ) , the luminosity measured could be explained .",
    "the very hard spectra observed , however , are not compatible with any spectral states of stellar mass black hole binaries ( @xcite ) and superposition of x - ray spectra suffering from different absorption column densities is required .",
    "a large number of x - ray binaries are expected in starburst galaxies .",
    "the integrated luminosity of high mass x - ray binaries , which have a hard x - ray spectrum , formed by starburst activity is related to sfr @xcite .",

    "such point sources , however , are distributed over a region of several hundreds of parsecs , which is much larger than the limit on the source size of the s nucleus .",
    "a single nuclear source is therefore more conceivable , although the possibility of superposition of multiple sources can not be completely excluded .",
    "a two component thermal plasma model also explains the shape of the observed spectra (  [ thermal_model ] ) . thermal plasma emission with a temperature lower than @xmath151 kev",

    "such a component is extended to the scale of host galaxy and intrinsic absorption is generally small .",
    "our spectral fit indicates that emission from plasma with @xmath152 kev should be significantly absorbed by a column density of @xmath115 @xmath19 or higher if such a component exists .",
    "thus the observed properties are unusual to be interpreted as starburst galaxies in terms of the small source size and low-@xmath153 plasma confined and hidden behind absorbing matter .",
    "in addition to our mir and x - ray evidence for the agn , recent radio and nir observations also suggest the agn activity in the s nucleus . @xcite",
    "found a highly collimated bipolar jet - like outflow of molecular gas from the s nucleus using _ alma_.",
    "it extends up to 4  ( 700  pc ) from the nucleus and is associated with a bipolar spur of radio continuum emission .",
    "they inferred from the morphology and kinematics of the molecular outflow and from the radio feature a jet - driving agn in the s nucleus .",
    "they also found that the continuum spectral slope at 860  @xmath1 m is flatter at the s nucleus than at the n nucleus .",
    "more synchrotron emission from an agn in the s nucleus would explain the difference .",
    "similar bipolar outflow from the s nucleus was also detected in the nir h@xmath21",

    "in addition to the x - ray to mir sed ( @xcite ; see also  [ x_mir ] below ) , the x - ray to radio sed has been used to distinguish types of nuclear activities because these wavelengths are least sensitive to extinction and contamination by stellar activities is minimal there @xcite .",

    "our new x - ray luminosity is only 26% larger than that of @xcite , and the revised @xmath155 remains in the range of low - luminosity agns as @xcite discussed .",

    "ulirgs generally show deeper silicate absorption ( @xmath172 ) than in agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and such deep absorption requires that the energy source is deeply embedded in dust that is both optically and geometrically ( along radial direction ) thick , as well as geometrically smooth @xcite . for example , slab geometry can not make the absorption @xmath173 even with @xmath174 , because one needs temperature gradient within the dusty region and the illuminated surface of the dust should be hidden from our direct views @xcite .",

    ", our x - ray spectrum analysis with a dual - component model suggests that a classical picture of type-2 agns with a dusty torus immediately surrounding a supermassive black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) applies to the s nucleus .",
    "firstly , the elevated column density at the s nucleus is compatible with a typical dusty torus of compton - thin type-2 agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the model also suggests that @xmath38% of the primary x - ray spectrum is seen unabsorbed by the heavy absorber , and this component can be interpreted as emission scattered by ionized medium in the opening part of the putative obscuring torus around the agn .",

    ", we showed that the circumnuclear star formation dominates the mir flux at a @xmath43  scale , and it is not surprising that the t - recs spectrum from the 13 slit shows pah features because the t - recs flux and the irs flux within the 36 aperture are almost the same (  [ mir_sed_modeling ] ) .",
    "we also showed that the x - ray - to - mir luminosity ratio is consistent with typical agns if we consider only the agn contribution at mir after excluding contribution from the circumnuclear star - forming regions (  [ x_mir ] ) .",

    "the agn in the s nucleus is energetically much less important at mir than the rest within ngc  3256 (  [ summary_mir_sed_modeling ] ) , and previous estimates of the fractional agn contribution within the galaxy seem not sensitive enough to detect the agn .",
