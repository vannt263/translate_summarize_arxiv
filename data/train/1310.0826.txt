    "<S> strikingly , these curves show non - monotonic behavior . specifically , for small values of @xmath5 , an increase of the temperature leads to a sharp decrease of the pressure , whereas for large values of @xmath5 , the system s pressure re - establishes the ideal gas pressure - temperature dependence expected for non - active particles .    the behavior of the pressure at low temperatures ( or large @xmath11 ) </S>",
    "<S> can be rationalized with the following argument : the two relevant time scales in the system are the decay of the rotational correlation time due to thermal fluctuations , this can be written for the specific cases of two and three dimensions as @xmath34 @xcite , where @xmath35 is the system dimensionality , and the time required for the particles to move across the system . </S>",
    "<S> the latter time - scale at low @xmath5 is dominated by the active motion , and scales as @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as long as @xmath37 , i.e. the rotational motion does not decorrelate faster than the time required for the particle to cross the container , there will always be a net linear contribution to the pressure on the wall by the active force . </S>",
    "<S> a simple way of estimating the average pressure in this regime can be obtained by considering that a particle can be either on the wall pushing with a force proportional to @xmath11 , or diffusing across the box generating no pressure on the wall . </S>",
    "<S> a particle on the wall will exert a force for a time of the order of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the average time spent by the particle diffusing across the box without generating any pressure on the wall is @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , over the time @xmath39 the force exerted on the wall by a single active particle can be estimated as @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> multiplying by @xmath2 and dividing by the surface , one obtains the total pressure , @xmath41 and in the limit @xmath42 , this can be further simplified to @xmath43    we expect    that the exact numerical value of the pressure will be dependent on the specific geometry of the boundary , as the behavior of the particles on the surface is well known to be strongly sensitive to it @xcite    , but the qualitative nonmonotonic behavior observed here should remain unaltered .    to account for this uncertainty </S>",

    "<S> a simple expansion of eq .   in this limit gives @xmath50 indicating that , as is typical for nonactive ideal gases , the pressure depends on the square of the particle velocities . </S>",
    "<S> of course , such an expansion assumes that the particle velocities are proportional to the active force , but at large temperatures , one can not neglect the contribution of thermal fluctuations to the motion of the particle . in this regime , we appeal to the insights of equilibrium statistical mechanics and make the assumption that the pressure is proportional to the average translational kinetic energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of self - propulsion when @xmath49 can be viewed as a perturbation of an ideal gas . </S>",
    "<S> one way to associate a pressure in this regime is to compute @xmath51 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) ( see appendix a ) . for simplicity , we consider particles confined to two dimensions and only have a single degree of rotational freedom . assuming the system reaches its steady state ( i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , we can write @xmath54 measurements of @xmath55 in numerical simulations performed in two dimensions on a system with periodic boundary conditions are in good agreement with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ v2 ] .    assuming that in this limit we can write the pressure as @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number density . </S>",
    "<S> the first term captures the ideal gas behavior , whereas the second term corrects for the increase of the velocity of the particles due to their propulsion . </S>",
    "<S> this correction is not a constant factor , but slowly decays with the temperature as the extent of the random thermal forces overwhelms ( affecting both rotational and linear degrees of freedom ) the role of the active ones . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that , if the pressure / velocity relation that we used in eq . </S>",
    "<S> is indeed applicable to an active gas , it can only be valid for very high temperatures and large values of @xmath4 .    remarkably , we find that the equation obtained by simply adding the ideal gas limit @xmath59 to eq .  [ this3 ] </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : press_pvk3 ] also indicate how the average fraction of particles on the surface of a container , @xmath48 , defined as the number of particles that are within a particle radius , @xmath63 , from the boundary divided by the total number of particles in the system , depends on @xmath11 , for different values of the temperature . at low temperatures / large - propulsions </S>",

    "<S> is intimately linked to the virial expansion of the pressure at low densities : when @xmath82 , the system has nearly ideal behavior and molecular interactions are negligible , @xmath83 is the signature of a positive second virial coefficient pointing to an effectively repulsive nature of the interactions between the particles , and @xmath84 would point to an effective attraction that under the appropriate conditions would lead to phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> the compressibility factor as a function of volume fraction @xmath85 at several values of @xmath11 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : press_pvd ] . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , for small values of @xmath11 , the purely repulsive nature of the interparticle interactions leads to @xmath83 , for the range of volume fractions considered in these simulations . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , there exist values of @xmath74 smaller than one which appear for a range of low densities until excluded volume interactions eventually take over at larger @xmath75 to restore the expected @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to associate the value of @xmath84 with an effective attraction among the particles leading to a phase separation between the high density layers on the surface and the low density in the bulk , however , it is not clear that a simple relation between the virial coefficients and the sign of the interaction between the particles also holds for active non - ideal gases </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , phase separation of spherical self - propelled particles has been recently observed and predicted in two and three dimensional systems with periodic boundary conditions@xcite .    to understand this behavior it is instructive to consider how the active force ( the dominant term in the large @xmath11 limit ) generates a pressure on the wall . </S>",
    "<S> for an ideal active gas , particles accumulating at the walls can freely slide across its surface until they align their propulsion axis parallel to the normal of the wall , thus each contributing the maximal force @xmath11(when @xmath86 ) to the pressure . for a non - ideal active gas , excluded </S>",
