    "determining the intrinsic shapes of the luminosity and mass distributions of elliptical galaxies is an important unresolved problem .",
    "both observational constraints from individual systems and predictions from theory demonstrate that the stellar and dark matter components of ellipticals are well described as triaxial ellipsoids .",
    "parametric ( e.g. , ryden 1992 ; lambas , maddox , & loveday 1992 ) and non - parametric ( fasano & vio 1991 ; tremblay & merritt 1995 ; ryden 1996 ) inversions of the ellipticity distribution of the stellar components rule out the hypotheses that elliptical galaxies are all oblate or all prolate . because of the information lost in projection , inversions that include triaxiality can not determine a unique shape distribution , but the ellipticals seem to fall into two classes : bright ( @xmath5 ) , triaxial , boxy galaxies and faint , roughly oblate , disky galaxies ( tremblay & merritt 1996 ) .",
    "this division is consistent with other structural , dynamical , and evolutionary evidence for two classes of ellipticals ( e.g. , fasano 1991 ; fasano & vio 1991 ; busarello , longo , & feoli 1992 ; capaccioli , caon , & donofrio 1992 ; nieto , poulain , & davoust 1994 ; jrgensen & franx 1994 ; kormendy & bender 1996 ) .    binney ( 1978 , 1985 ; see also contopoulos 1956 ) first noted that a triaxial galaxy with its net angular momentum vector aligned with its short axis would show a `` kinematic misalignment '' between the projected axes of the rotation and the light , and surveys of elliptical galaxy kinematics have found that such kinematic misalignments are common ( davies & birkinshaw 1988 ; franx , illingworth , & heckman 1989 ; jedrzejewski & schechter 1989 ) .",
    "however , a kinematic misalignment may also be caused by an _",
    "intrinsic _ misalignment between the rotational and the short axes because the angular momentum vector of an equilibrium triaxial system can lie anywhere in the plane of the long and short axes ( heiligman & schwarzschild 1979 ) .",
    "alternatively , the galaxy may not be in equilibrium ( due to a recent accretion event or to tidal forces from a satellite galaxy ) , or it may be a misidentified s0 with a bar ( see merritt 1997a for a review of examples ) . a statistical analysis of kinematic misalignments in bright ellipticals ( franx , illingworth , & de zeeuw 1991 ) found limits on the mean stellar triaxiality and the mean intrinsic misalignment angle of @xmath6 0.7 and @xmath7 45@xmath4 , where the upper bounds for both parameters occurred only for solutions with two widely - separated peaks . although degeneracies prevented strong constraints on @xmath8 , there were indications for a bimodal population of galaxies , with a large fraction of nearly - oblate , short - axis rotators , and a small fraction of nearly - prolate , long - axis rotators .",
    "tenjes et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and statler ( 1994a , b , statler & fry 1994 ) have devised methods which invert the projected streamlines of stellar orbits to determine the intrinsic shape of a galaxy , and their initial results also indicate the existence of a bimodal population ( statler , dutta , & bak 1997 ; bak & statler 1997 ) .",
    "theoretical models of halo formation generally produce flattened , prolate - triaxial halos ( e.g. , bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ; frenk et al .",
    "1988 ; white & ostriker 1990 ; aguilar & merritt 1990 ; katz 1991 ; cannizzo & hollister 1992 ; cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath9-body simulations of a small sample of halos by dubinski ( 1991 , 1992 ) and dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) found that at 25 kpc they are very flat ( mean short axis ratio of @xmath10 ) and nearly - prolate ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the final halo shapes and angular momenta were very sensitive to the initial cosmological tidal field , and the angular momentum vectors were well - aligned with the short axes , with an average intrinsic misalignment of @xmath12 .",
    "warren et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found similar results ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 at 40 kpc ) , and found that the more massive halos were slightly flatter and more prolate .",
    "again , the angular momentum vector was most commonly aligned with the short axis .",
    "we expect dissipative processes to produce baryonic galaxies with shapes that are drastically different from those of their parent halos ( e.g. , katz & gunn 1991 ; udry 1993 ; navarro & white 1994 ) , but the concomitant effects on the shapes of the halos are unclear .",
    "preliminary simulations suggest that halos become rounder and more oblate through interactions with baryons ( evrard , summers , & davis 1994 ; dubinski 1994 ) , probably due to the destruction and damping of halo box orbits .",
    "dubinski ( 1994 ) found that the flatness and prolateness are reduced relative to a dissipationless model ( @xmath15 0.6 versus 0.4 , and @xmath16 0.4 - 0.5 versus 0.8 , at 20 kpc ) .",
    "late , major mergers of disk galaxies in compact groups may have produced some fraction of the present population of ellipticals ( e.g. , heyl , hernquist , & spergel 1994 ; weil & hernquist 1996 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "although the simulations have not carefully explored the effects of the mergers on the shapes of the dark halos , weil & hernquist ( 1996 ) suggest that the shapes of remnant halos are rather round and oblate - triaxial , having no correlation with the shapes of the remnant stellar distributions .",
    "current theoretical and observational results thus suggest that the modestly triaxial - oblate luminous parts of elliptical galaxies are embedded in halos which are more prolate , so that there should be a strong gradient with radius in the triaxiality of the mass distribution .",
    "direct measurements of the shapes of halos are far more difficult than measurements of the shapes of the stellar distributions . careful examination of the kinematics of polar rings ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1993 ) , gas disks ( lees 1991 ; bertola et al . 1991 ; franx , van gorkom , & de zeeuw 1994 ; plana & boulesteix 1996 ; bureau & freeman 1997 ) , and planetary nebulae ( hui et al . 1995 ; mathieu , dejonghe , & hui 1996 ) have been used to constrain the shapes of both stellar and dark matter potentials .",
    "unfortunately , such tracers are rarely found at large enough galactocentric radii to be helpful for probing the dark matter potential , and it is likely that there are systematic correlations between the shapes of halos and the presence of rings and disks .",
    "gravitational lenses can also be used to directly measure the shapes of mass distributions , and the data appear to require very flat mass distributions .",
    "however , the number of lenses is small , and the quantitative effects of external tidal perturbations are not yet understood ( king & browne 1996 ; kochanek 1996 ; keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1997 ; witt & mao 1997 ) . the most promising candidate for directly measuring the intrinsic shapes of nearby halos is high - resolution mapping of the x - ray emission from hot gas in the halo potential .",
    "for example , buote & canizares ( 1994 , 1996b , 1997 ; hereafter bc94 , bc96b , bc97 ) examined the radial profiles , position angles , and axis ratios of the x - ray isophotes of the bright , isolated e4 galaxy ngc 720 , and found that the shape and the position angle of the potential can not be produced by the stars .",
    "thus , by using only geometric evidence and the assumption that the gas is in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium , they showed that the stars must be embedded in a more massive , _ flatter _",
    ", dark matter halo . for the s0 galaxy ngc 1332 ,",
    "buote & canizares ( 1996a ) reached a qualitatively similar conclusion .",
    "x - ray observations can also be used to constrain the triaxialities of halos by searching for x - ray isophote twists .",
    "the projection of a triaxial light distribution whose triaxiality varies with radius produces isophotes whose axis orientations vary with radius ( see mihalas & binney 1981 ) .",
    "isophote twists in the optical surface brightness are common ( e.g. , williams & schwarzschild 1979 ; leach 1981 ) , and can be used to constrain the shape of an individual galaxy ( fasano 1995 ) , although care must be taken to rule out intrinsic axis twist caused by other factors ( fasano & bonoli 1989 ; nieto et al .",
    "x - ray emission from a triaxial system can show an analogous isophote twist  as pointed out by binney ( 1978 ) for the case of a galaxy cluster  allowing the triaxiality of an individual galaxy s potential to be probed . in the simplest case ,",
    "if a galaxy s luminous and dark matter distributions are intrinsically aligned and have _ constant _ but _ different _ triaxialities , then the projected axes of its x - ray isophotes will twist from small radii , where the potential is dominated by the stellar core , to large radii , where it is dominated by the dark halo . similarly , as discussed by bc96b , the radial triaxiality gradients produced in halos by dissipative processes can result in x - ray isophote twists .",
    "here we employ simple models to study the behavior of x - ray twists , and to determine how well they constrain the triaxiality of halos . in  2.1 , we use an analytic approximation to find the amplitudes of twists expected for different assumptions about the shapes of galaxies and halos . in  2.2 , we numerically calculate and project the x - ray emission for a small sample of models to verify the predictions of the analytic model , and to examine the radial behavior of the twist more closely . in  3 , we attempt to model",
    "the large twist observed in ngc 720 ( bc94 , bc96b ) , and we present our conclusions in  4 .",
    "an ellipsoidal luminosity density @xmath17 with constant axis ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 depends only on the ellipsoidal coordinate @xmath20 ( hereafter , we will set @xmath21 for simplicity ) . when it is projected in the spherical - polar coordinate direction ( @xmath22 ) , with the observer s @xmath23-axis along the line of sight",
    ", its surface brightness can be expressed as a one - dimensional integral of the radial density profile , @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 for @xmath27 , the line of sight is along the short axis ; for @xmath28 , it is along the long axis ; and for @xmath29 , it is along the intermediate axis .",
    "the surface brightness @xmath30 is also ellipsoidal , with a constant axis ratio @xmath31 and a constant minor axis position angle @xmath32 from the projection of the short axis .",
    "if the galaxy rotates about its short axis , @xmath32 is equivalent to the kinematic misalignment angle .",
    "the axis ratio and the position angle are @xmath33 @xmath34 equations 1 and 2 were derived by binney ( 1985 ) .",
    "the axis ratio @xmath35 is a function of the projection angles and both axis ratios of the triaxial ellipsoid , but the position angle @xmath36 is a function of only the triaxiality parameter @xmath37 and the projection angles ( franx , illingworth , & de zeeuw 1991 ) .",
    "if we now consider two triaxial distributions whose three - dimensional axes are intrinsically aligned , but which have different triaxialities ( @xmath38 ) , they are misaligned in projection by the angle @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 @xmath41 ^ 2.\\ ] ] if the two distributions have the same triaxialities ( @xmath42 ) , then the misalignment angle is zero ( @xmath43 ) ; and if one of the distributions is oblate ( @xmath44 ) , then the misalignment angle is equal to the other distribution s kinematic misalignment angle ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "these expressions for the misalignment angle are applicable to the case of a luminous galaxy embedded in a dark halo , where the two distributions have differing triaxialities , labeled by @xmath8 and @xmath46 .",
    "the projected mass will not be aligned with the projected light , an effect which can be important in gravitational lens systems ( keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1997 ) . to demonstrate the amplitude of the misalignment for this simple model , figure 1 shows the misalignment angle as a function of the viewing angles , @xmath47 , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "large misalignment angles ( @xmath50 ) occur when the distribution is viewed near the major axis ( @xmath51 ) at intermediate latitudes ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the mean misalignment angle , @xmath53 , and its dispersion , @xmath54 , averaged over all viewing angles ( @xmath55 ) , for all possible triaxialities ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the dispersion @xmath54 is comparable to the mean , and @xmath53 increases smoothly with @xmath57 , so that the largest mean misalignments occur when the system consists of a very oblate spheroid and a very prolate spheroid .",
    "figure 2 also illustrates the misalignment angles expected for a naive model of the shapes of galaxies and their halos .",
    "if we assume a luminous galaxy with rough shape limits taken from model ia of franx , illingworth , & de zeeuw ( 1991 ) , and embed it in a dissipationless dark halo whose shape is taken from the models of dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) , we find large typical misalignments , @xmath58 .",
    "if we use the model for a dissipational halo from dubinski ( 1994 ) , the typical misalignment angle drops to @xmath59 . in both cases ,",
    "misalignments much larger and much smaller than the mean are common .",
    "thus , for both galaxy formation models , the projected mass will for some viewing angles show a substantial position angle twist from small radii ( where the luminous matter is dominant ) to large radii ( where the dark matter is dominant ) .",

    "although the twist and the ellipticity at large radii are marginally compatible with the data , the twist transition is too gradual and too close to the core . despite much experimentation with the model parameters , we could not significantly improve our fit to the transition . by adding a discrete source component to the x - ray emission",
    ", we can push the transition radius further outward , but it becomes far more difficult to fit the amplitude of the twist .",
    "the effects are similar if we compute the twist with the moment method ( bc94 ) , or if we allow for substantial rotation of the x - ray emitting gas in the central regions .",
    "we thus qualitatively confirm the tentative result of bc96b that it is very difficult for simple models with a radial triaxiality gradient to simultaneously fit both the high ellipticity and the large , abrupt twist of the observed x - ray isophotes .",

    "1990 ; sparks et al .",
    "1991 ) , as is the approximate position angle of the outer x - ray isophotes .",
    "current observational evidence indicates that the stellar parts of elliptical galaxies are modestly flattened and close to oblate , while current theories for the formation of galaxies suggest that the halos are more flattened and more prolate .",
    "the extent of this shape difference depends on the interactions between baryons and dissipationless dark matter during galaxy formation , but all current models imply that the mass distribution of an early type galaxy increases in flatness and prolateness with radius .",
    "there is already some evidence from the flatness of x - ray isophotes ( buote & canizares 1994 , 1996a ) and from gravitational lens models ( king & browne 1996 ; kochanek 1996 ) that the typical mass distribution may be flatter than the luminosity distribution .",
    "a difference in triaxiality between luminous galaxies and their dark halos is detectable through misalignments of gravitational lenses with their stellar distributions , and is a natural explanation for the second shear axis that is necessary to fit lensing models , although intrinsic misalignments and external tidal shear sources are also viable explanations ( keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "such a triaxiality difference also produces x - ray isophote twists ( binney 1978 ; buote & canizares 1996b ) .",
    "we examined the behavior of x - ray isophote twists using several simple models of a luminous galaxy of constant triaxiality embedded in an intrinsically - aligned dark halo of a different triaxiality .",
    "a simple analytic approximation gives accurate estimates of the asymptotic position angles of the x - ray isophotes , but predicting the detailed radial behavior of the twist requires numerical simulations .",
    "for a reasonable model of a galaxy and halo , we find that the x - ray isophote position angle makes a gradual transition from the center of the galaxy , where it is aligned with the position angle of the optical isophotes , to the periphery , where it is aligned with the position angle of the projected halo mass .",
    "the `` half - way '' point of the twist occurs well inside the stellar effective radius ( @xmath116  0.1 - 0.6 @xmath115 ) , and is not detectable given present x - ray resolution limits , but the misalignment of the x - ray isophotes at large radii with the stellar isophotes is more easily observable . by examining the amplitude of the misalignment for a large population of galaxies , we can in principle distinguish between alternative models for the halo shapes .",
    "the very prolate halos predicted by dissipationless collapse simulations should produce mean misalignments of @xmath1 at @xmath183 , while the more oblate halos predicted by simulations which include baryonic dissipation should produce smaller misalignments ( @xmath125 ) . in practice",
    ", measurements of these twists will be difficult because the twist angles are small , the x - ray isophotes are fairly round ( @xmath184 ) , and the number of isolated , nearby x - ray galaxies is limited .",
    "our results are not very sensitive to the parameters of the model , but the presence of a discrete source component can modify the detailed properties of the twist and should be included in any statistical test . note that while we scaled our models to match the halo shapes predicted by simulations , _ any _ mass distribution with a strong radial triaxiality gradient will produce an x - ray isophote twist when observed from the proper angles .",
    "for example , the disruption of box orbits by a central stellar cusp can cause the central parts of an elliptical galaxy to become more oblate than the outer parts due to the longer time scales for scattering and phase mixing of the outer orbits ( e.g. merritt 1997b ) , leaving a twisting signature in the x - ray isophote position angles .",
    "we attempted to model the observed x - ray twist of the bright , isolated e4 galaxy ngc 720 ( bc94 , bc96b ) , whose x - ray isophotes are strongly flattened , and show a large , abrupt position angle twist of @xmath185 at @xmath116 1 - 2 @xmath115 .",
    "while a model halo from the dissipationless scenario fits the data better than does a halo from the dissipational scenario , it is in both scenarios difficult to reproduce both the twist behavior and the isophote flatness using reasonable parameters for the galaxy and halo .",
    "the simplest explanation for ngc 720 is that the halo and the stars are intrinsically misaligned . such an intrinsic misalignment may arise naturally for a halo which forms by dissipationless collapse , or it may be caused by late - history major mergers .",
    "whether caused by triaxiality or by intrinsic misalignment , the shapes and orientations of stellar and x - ray isophotes are important fossil clues to the formation history of galaxies .",
