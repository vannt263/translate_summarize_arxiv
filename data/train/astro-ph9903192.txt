    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , even being rare objects , are the dominant population in the local universe .",
    "they may have formed by the interactions and mergers of molecular gas - rich spirals , that emit the maximum of their infrared luminosity when the two nuclei merge .",
    "they may also represent the first stage in the formation of the cores of elliptical galaxies ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "theoretical models show that the merger process can accumulate a large concentration of gas in the centers of these galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "this central reservoir of gas can fuel a powerful starburst or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , one of these two phenomena being the dominant energy source in ulirgs .",
    "in fact , the nuclear spectrum of 2/3 of these galaxies can be classified as seyfert or liner and the remaining 1/3 as starburst galaxies ( kim 1995 ) . however , there are also some galaxies where the starburst and agn characteristics co - exist in their nucleus .",
    "one of the famous ulirgs is arp 220 ( londsdale et al 1994 ; smith et al 1998 ) .",
    "most of these ulirgs are very far away , and the observations do not have enough spatial resolution to measure independently the contribution of the starburst and agn components to the total luminosity of these galaxies .",
    "to shed some light on the question of the nature of the dominant energy source in infrared galaxies , we present here ultraviolet and optical data of four seyfert 2 nuclei ( mrk 477 , ngc 5135 , ngc 5135 and ic 3639 ) that have ir luminosities @xmath0 10@xmath4 l@xmath2 and can be classified as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) .",
    "they are located at a distance of @xmath0 50 mpc ( except mrk 477 which is at 150 mpc ) .",
    "they are close enough that their nuclear zone can be resolved by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and to enable us to measure the starburst and agn contribution to the nuclear activity .",
    "this makes these seyfert 2 galaxies benchmarks to study the starburst - agn connection in more distant ulirgs .",
    "a more extended analysis of these data is presented in heckman et al ( 1997 ) and gonzlez delgado et al ( 1998a ) . here , this analysis is complemented with the results obtained from ground - based optical spectra of a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the sample contains 20 of the brightest seyfert 2 nuclei selected from the compilation of whittle ( 1992 ) .",
    "the brightness of the nucleus is defined as a function of the [ oiii ] @xmath55007 + 4959 emission line flux and the monochromatic flux ( @xmath6 ) of the nuclear non - thermal radio source at 1.4 ghz .",
    "all of them satisfy at least one of the two following criteria : log f@xmath7}\\geq$ ] -12.0 ( erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ) and log f@xmath10 -15.0 ( erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the criteria used guarantees that the sample is unbiased with respect to the presence or absence of a nuclear starburst .",
    "we have taken ground - based optical and near infrared spectroscopy of all the targets with the 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "archive images at optical wavelengths are also available for most of the objects .",
    "hst uv images have been obtained for 12 of the 20 seyfert 2 nuclei using the faint object camera ( foc ) .",
    "we have also obtained uv spectra of 4 of these 12 seyfert 2 nuclei with the hst goddard high resolution spectrometer ( ghrs ) .",
    "these are : mrk 477 , ngc 7130 , ngc 5135 and ic 3639 .",
    "they were chosen from the subsample of 12 seyfert 2 nuclei for having the highest uv flux on arcsec scales .",
    "uv images were obtained with the foc using the f/96 relay through the filter f210 m .",
    "this filter does not include any strong emission lines ; therefore , the emission is dominated by the uv continuum at 2150  .",
    "the field of view is about 14@xmath1114 arcsec and the pixel size 0.014 arcsec .    in the four galaxies ,",
    "the uv images show that the uv continuum source is spatially resolved .",
    "the central 1 arcsec ( 730 to 210 pc ) shows a morphology very similar to starburst galaxies .",
    "the effective radius of the starburst that ranges from 55 pc in ic 3639 to 200 pc in ngc 5135 indicates that they are very compact .",
    "they are formed by several knots that have sizes and luminosities very similar to young clusters ( meurer et al 1995 ) .",
    "the optically bright nucleus is barely detected at the uv ( see other examples in colina et al 1997 ) , and their uv emission is only a few percent ( @xmath12 15@xmath3 ) of the nuclear starburst emission ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the four galaxies were observed with the ghrs and the g140l grating , which has a nominal dispersion of 0.57  / diode , using the large science aperture ( lsa , 1.74@xmath111.74 arcsec ) and covering 1150 - 1600  .",
    "the spectra show the typical absorption features of starburst galaxies , indicating that the uv light is dominated by the starburst component .",
    "however , they also show narrow emission lines typical of seyfert 2 galaxies ( l@xmath13 and civ @xmath51549 , niv ] @xmath51486 , siiv+oiv ] @xmath51397 + 1403 , nv @xmath51240 , and cii@xmath51335 ) .",
    "the spectra are very rich in absorption features formed in the photospheres of o and b massive stars and in the interstellar medium of the galaxies .",
    "the interstellar lines are blueshifted by several hundred km s@xmath9 with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxies , indicating that the warm interstellar gas in these galaxies is outflowing .",
    "outflows of similar velocity have been detected in starburst galaxies ( gonzlez delgado et al 1998b ) .",
    "however , the strongest absorption features are the resonance lines civ @xmath51550 , siiv @xmath51400 and nv @xmath5 1240 formed in the stellar wind of o stars .",
    "these lines are very prominent if the spectrum is dominated by a starburst with age between 1 to 10 myr .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models based on the profile of the stellar wind and uv continuum luminosity indicate that these starbursts are heavily reddened ( 2 or 3 mag in the uv ) , very powerful ( bolometric luminosities of @xmath0 10@xmath1 l@xmath2 ) , were of short duration and have ages between 4 and 6 myr ( figure 2a ) .",
    "signatures of massive stars are also clearly detected in their optical and near - uv spectra where the high order balmer series ( h9 , h10 , and h11 ) and hei lines ( @xmath54921 , @xmath54387 , @xmath54026 and @xmath53819 ) are observed in absorption ( figure 2b ) .",
    "these lines are formed in the photospheres of o and b stars , and thus they also provide strong independent evidence of the presence of massive stars in these seyfert 2 nuclei . they have not been detected in mrk 477 because the balmer - emission lines formed in the narrow line region are so strong that they overwhelm the stellar absorption lines .",
    "however , its spectrum shows a broad emission line around heii @xmath54686 that may be produced by wolf - rayet stars . in the near - infrared",
    "we detect a strong caii triplet feature produced by red supergiant stars .",
    "this detailed study shows that when a conspicuous starburst is present in the nucleus of seyferts , the uv image shows a morphology similar to starburst galaxies , the uv spectrum shows strong wind p - cygni profiles , and the ground - based optical spectrum shows the high - order balmer series and hei in absorption .",
    "these results thus prove that the high - order balmer series and hei lines constitute a good indicator of the presence of massive stars in seyfert nuclei .",
    "the analysis of the whole sample of seyfert 2 galaxies suggests that a starburst is present in 40@xmath3 of the nuclei ( one example is in figure 3b ) because these lines are detected in the nuclear spectrum of eight of the twenty galaxies of the sample .",
    "on the other hand , the hst optical archive images of these galaxies show a nuclear morphology very similar to starburst galaxies , like the four seyfert 2 galaxies studied by us in detail ( figure 3a ) .",
    "the data provide direct evidence of the existence of nuclear starbursts that dominate the ultraviolet and optical light in at least 40@xmath3 of the seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the starburst is heavily reddened , compact and powerful .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of these starbursts are very similar to the estimated bolometric luminosities of their obscured seyfert 1 nuclei .",
    "these data suggest that more powerful agns may be related to more powerful central starbursts .",
    "these starbursts also make a significant contribution to the overall energetic of these galaxies .",
    "the 40@xmath3 of the seyfert 2 galaxies of our sample that show in their uv and/or optical nuclear spectra signatures of massive stars have fir luminosities over 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath9 , even one of them , mrk 273 , has ir luminosity up to 10@xmath15 l@xmath2 ; thus , they all can be classified as lirgs .",
    "there are other 4 galaxies in our sample that are very strong ir emitters but they do not show massive stellar features in their ground - based optical spectra .",
    "there are wfpc2 or foc images for three of these , and two of them show starburst morphology",
    ". it may be that in these two cases , the starburst is less conspiscuous than in the other seyfert 2 nuclei and they are not detected from the ground .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that most of the lirgs in our sample harbor a nuclear starburst that makes a significant contribution to or even dominates the energetics of a significant fraction of the lirgs .",
    "however , the exception in our sample is mrk 463e that does not show a starburst morphology at uv wavelengths , and the optical spectrum does not show massive stellar features . on the contrary",
    ", its uv foc image shows a conical diffuse structure that could be associated with the ionizing cone of the obscured seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "broad emission balmer components have been detected in polarized light ( tran 1995 ) .",
    "it may that in this lirgs , the main energy source is a agn .",
