    "<S> .  @xcite that is based on a @xmath0 laughlin state . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) any superposition of the three ground states has a nearly constant charge density in position space , which excludes that these states would form a charge - density wave in the thermodynamic limit ( see supplementary material ) .     </S>",
    "<S> a ) spectral evolution of the energy spectrum of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] in the sector with @xmath87 upon inserting a flux @xmath88 into the system , which is synonymous to twisting the boundary conditions in @xmath89 direction with a complex phase @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the three fractional chern insulator ground states evolve independently of the rest of the spectrum , and trade places , which signals their topological degeneracy and the charge fractionalization . </S>",
    "<S> b ) the energy spectrum of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] plotted against the total spin @xmath91 reveals the tower of states which evidencing the ferromagnetic nature of the ground state . ]    from the presented results we conclude that the steady state of graphene at @xmath1 total filling of the @xmath7 bands ( or @xmath2 filling of the band above the dirac cone ) is a ferromagnetic ffci . </S>",
    "<S> this distinct driven topological state has gapped charged excitations but supports gapless spin excitations , namely ferromagnetic magnons . </S>",
    "<S> the state features both conventional order and gapless topological order . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , its signature is a fractional contribution of @xmath92 ( in addition to the integer contribution of the lower band ) defined for the driven system @xcite .    to certify the robustness of the ffci state we have also tested its stability under changing some of the conditions discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we have investigated its fate upon changing to different light polarizations ( using @xmath93 as two examples ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ffci is still the groundstate of the system as long the chern number of the non interacting band is @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we have investigated its appearance on a different lattice system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that for spinless electrons on the @xmath7-flux square lattice with nearest neighbor repulsive interaction the ground state is also the ffci whenever @xmath94 are such that the non - interacting bands have @xmath53 ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> both of these results evidence the ubiquitousness and robustness of the ffci state .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ experimental - realization ] ] experimental realization : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the practical realization of this novel state in graphene possess two experimental challenges . </S>",
    "<S> the first is to reach incident field amplitudes @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> although it is in principle possible to reach such a regime , today experiments have only explored amplitudes of one order of magnitude lower @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the robustness and tuneability of the effect it is conceivable that lower frequencies and field amplitudes can in fact be sufficient to access the ffci state in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the second experimental issue is reaching the necessary filling factor of graphene s band structure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the electron density at @xmath2 filling of the upper band is of the order of @xmath96 , still below the van hove singularity in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> even higher values up to the van hove singularity have already been reached by chemical doping  @xcite and there are promising other routes by using for example polymer electrolytes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , other 2d materials with dirac electrons such as silicene can potentially be used to tune the band structure parameters and host similar phases . </S>",
    "<S> + to summarize , we have found that doped graphene , irradiated with polarized light , undergoes an interaction driven spontaneous topological phase transition to a floquet fractional chern insulator ( ffci ) state that features both topological and spontaneous ferromagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness and tuneability of the ffci state , appearing for different parameters , polarizations and lattices , evidences that this phase can be experimentally discovered in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , our work opens up a promising route to achieve tuneable realizations of elusive interacting fermionic and bosonic phases by periodically driving interacting systems .    </S>",
