    "cellulose is the most abundant organic material in nature and it is the basic structural component of the plant cell walls . in the higher plants ,",
    "cellulose crystalline microfibrils , 5 - 15  nm wide and  @xmath0 m long , are embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose , pectin polysaccharides and proteins  @xcite .",
    "bacterial cellulose composite , produced by _ acetobacter xylinum _ growing in a medium containing xyloglucan ( hemicellulose ) , is a pure cellulose ",
    "xyloglucan network with degree of crystallinity around 75%  @xcite .",
    "xyloglucan molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds to the amorphous surface of different cellulose fibrils creating crosslinks between them , which imparts elastic properties to the network .",
    "the dielectric properties of bacterial cellulose were studied in the frequency range 100  hz1  mhz and at temperatures between 100 and 440  k  @xcite .",
    "a broad peak of dielectric absorption was found for @xmath1  k , indicating a wide distribution of relaxation times .",
    "creep experiments on cell walls of higher plants and on composite material from _",
    "acetobacter xylinum _ have shown a logarithmic time dependence of elongation  @xcite . moreover , the authors have shown that , in presence of the cell wall loosening lipid transfer proteins ( ltp ) , the elongation remains logarithmic but with a higher creep rate .",
    "these slowing down of relaxation and logarithmic time evolution are dynamical features typical of glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "evidence of glassy behaviour in biologically relevant materials may be of general importance .",
    "schrdinger in his seminal book  @xcite described the building blocks of life as `` aperiodic crystals '' , orderly structures withdrawn from the disorder of heat motion .",
    "much later , the general concept of glassy state has been developed  @xcite ) as a state with infinitely many local metastable configurations .",
    "such a glassy state is prone to minor changes of environment since even small external actions can transfer the system as a whole into a different metastable state , while never reaching thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "interestingly , the transition to a glassy state found in saccharides at low temperature  @xcite has been suggested to be the key factor in the protection of biological tissue against freezing .",
    "for these reasons , it is plausible to assume that living organisms should make use of substances with a broad variety of similar structures depending on external conditions , as offered by glassy materials .",
    "evidence of slow glassy dynamics of the cytoskeleton of living cells was recently observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the simplest and , at the same time , one of the most important organic materials , cellulose , is a good starting point to investigate this possible connection theoretically .",
    "the physical mechanism which is responsible for glass formation is the presence of _ frustration _ ,",
    "i.e. the incompatibility between the locally preferred order and global constrains . in other words ,",
    "the energy of the system can not be minimized by optimizing all local atomic interactions  @xcite .    in the cellulose  xyloglucan system ,",
    "frustration gives rise to defects in the microfibril organisation due to long - range xyloglucan  xyloglucan interactions . to simulate this phenomenon",
    ", we propose a model that describes cellulose microfibrils and xyloglucan molecules at the mesoscopic , coarse grained , level .",
    "correlation functions of the microfibril orientation calculated within this model display the slow logarithmic behaviour typical of glasses over two time decades",
    ". similar logarithmic decay of correlators has been observed in monte carlo simulations for spin - glasses  @xcite , colloids and micellar particles  @xcite , and overcooled liquids  @xcite .",
    "this slow dynamics is often explained in terms of mode - coupling theory  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we present the model and the results of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations for the cellulose network , analyze the structure and dynamics identifying the glassy behaviour , and point out the crucial role of the xyloglucan network for the slow dynamics of cellulose microfibrils .",
    "we propose the coarse grained atomistic model illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] to simulate bacterial cellulose  @xcite , a prototype of cellulose in higher plants .",
    "the model consists of long stiff rods , each constituted by seven beads , representing cellulose microfibrils , connected by a network of stretchable crosslinks , representing xyloglucan molecules .    in our coarse - grained model ,",
    "there are four types of interactions between : 1 )  beads within a rod  ( b - b ) , 2 )  beads in different rods  ( r - r ) , 3 )  xyloglucan particles and rod beads  ( x - r ) and 4 )  xyloglucan particles  ( x - x ) .",
    "we have chosen these interactions with the following criteria : i )  the x - r bonding sets the scale of energy to that typical of a hydrogen bond , ii )  the rods have to be stiff , impenetrable , very long compared to typical bonding lenghts , and the interactions between them are dominated by the interactions via xyloglucan particles , iii )  the xyloglucan has to form a disordered network connecting different rods with the possibility of bond stretching , breaking and formation .",
    "this is less straightforward than the previous steps and will be described in some details later  on .",
    "we describe most interactions by a lennard - jones potential of the form : @xmath2+c_s,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 labels the different interactions .",
    "the minimum of the potential , -@xmath4 , occurs at @xmath5 .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is chosen in such a way that the potential vanishes at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a cut - off radius and @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the parameters are given in table  [ tab1 ] in units of the characteristic energy and length of x - r interactions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "for bacterial cellulose , these units can be assumed as @xmath13  kcal / mol @xmath14  k , which describes a strong hydrogen x - r bonding  @xcite , and @xmath15   nm that gives the typical radius of the microfibrils . in these units ,",
    "the equilibrium length of each rod corresponds to the typical length of cellulose microfibrils , @xmath16  @xmath0 m with an equilibrium distance between them @xmath17  nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "moreover , the cut - off radius of @xmath18 is chosen in such a way that each xyloglucan particle interacts with no more than one rod @xmath19 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .    in order to keep the rods rigid",
    ", we add to @xmath20 a simple bending potential between the nearest beads within a rod given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) , @xmath23 is the position of the bead @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "this strong potential allows to decrease the cut - off radius @xmath26 of @xmath20 and lower the computational time .",
    "we come now to the interactions between xyloglucan particles , which play the role of crosslinks between rods . to obtain a connected network of rods with effective long - range interactions , we require each xyloglucan particle to interact with two others .",
    "these triplets of connected particles are chosen once and for all at the beginning of the simulation as described in the following .",
    "we place three x - particles per rod at the equilibrium distance of @xmath18 from the second , fourth and sixth bead of each rod . for each x - particle",
    "we choose a first partner as the farthest x - particle within a radius @xmath27 that is not yet assigned as partner of another particle .",
    "we repeat this procedure to assign the second partner . once all triplets have been assigned , the distances between them in the initial structure are defined as equilibrium distance @xmath28 for the additional interaction between particles within a triplet described by a morse potential @xmath29 with parameters @xmath30 specified in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "this means that every pair interacts through a potential with minimum at a different value of @xmath28 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyl_distr ] , the initial @xmath28-distribution contains seven sharp peaks .",
    "we further assume that a bond between x - x pairs can be broken if @xmath31 , which introduces a cut - off radius @xmath32 for x - x interactions @xmath33 the resulting network is very robust and less than 6% of the x - x bonds break at all studied temperatures .",
    "the long - range interactions between xyloglucan particles introduce frustration in the orientation of the rods , that in their absence , would energetically prefer to form a crystal of parallel rods .",
    "although there is a large arbitrariness in our construction of the interactions , we can assume that frustration due to competing interactions is a quite general feature of non crystalline multicomponent systems , ( like most living matter ) .",
    "simulations of glasses have to be conducted possibly over several decades in time .",
    "however this fact , together with the complexity of the interatomic potentials , limits the size of the system . in our simulation",
    "we use @xmath34 rods , located in parallelepiped with 6 unit cells in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions and 14 in the @xmath37 direction . in each unit cell ,",
    "defined by vectors @xmath38 we put four beads at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we form the rods by letting the beads interact with each other in groups of seven along the @xmath37 direction , which implies two layers of densely packed rods along the @xmath37 direction . in fig .",
    "[ snapshot]a we show a typical snapshot of the equilibrated system where the two layers of rods and the x - r bonds are visible , whereas in figure  [ snapshot]b we show only the bonds between a few xyloglucan triplets .    in essence , our system is like a liquid crystal with the unit vector of rod orientation @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) , playing the role of order parameter . the constructed configuration , composed of @xmath44 particles , was equilibrated at high temperature @xmath45 in the microcanonical @xmath46 ensemble .",
    "we integrated the equations of motion rescaled by the mass of the rod bead taken to be @xmath47  kg , which is twice the mass of xyloglucan particles , by means of the velocity verlet algorithm .",
    "the time step in units of @xmath48  ns was chosen @xmath49 , the shortest period of vibrations between x - r particles being @xmath50 .",
    "then , the system was quenched with rate @xmath51 k / s and studied in the @xmath52 ensemble , and studied at @xmath53 , using the nose ",
    "hoover chain thermostat  @xcite .",
    "the masses of the thermostat chains were defined by @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 , the characteristic frequency of x - r vibrations . for convenience , in the following , we give the values of temperature in reduced units as @xmath57 .",
    "note that , @xmath58 corresponds to room temperature .    in the following sections , we study separately the effect of temperature and the role of intermolecular interactions by comparing systems with weak x - r bonds ( @xmath59 ) and broken x - x bonds ( @xmath60 ) to the original one ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we describe the static structure by calculating the distribution function of the polar angle  @xmath61 between the director @xmath43 of the rod and the @xmath37 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) , as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total number of time origins .",
    "a similar function @xmath64 can be constructed for the azimuthal angle @xmath65 in the @xmath66-plane .",
    "the temperature dependence of the orientation distribution function @xmath67 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] . at high temperatures ( @xmath68 ) a broad angular distribution of rods orientation peaked at @xmath69 results from the sampling by the system large part of the available microstates",
    "as temperature decreases , a second preferable orientation of the rods at @xmath70 appears , indicating some structural rearrangement below @xmath71 as seen at @xmath72 . at lower temperatures both",
    "peaks become more pronounced , until at @xmath73 they merge into a `` plateau '' around @xmath74 and a peak at larger @xmath61 appears .",
    "a crossover between high and low temperature structures seems to occur between 1.9 and 0.9 .",
    "this crossover is confirmed by looking at the azimuthal angle distribution @xmath64 , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phi ] .",
    "we see that while three peaks are present at all temperatures , the relatively sharp peak at @xmath75 for @xmath76 determines a prefered orientation of the rods in the @xmath66-plane .",
    "consequently , both distribution functions suggest the appearance of additional order at low temperatures below @xmath71 as observed at @xmath77 .    in order to single out the role of the xyloglucan network , we study two systems with broken x - x and with weak x - r bonds .",
    "the resulting distribution @xmath67 for the system with broken x - x bonds is rather similar to the original one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : theta]c ) .",
    "however , for the system with weak x - r bonds , @xmath67 has only one pronounced preferred orientation  @xmath78 ( instead of being double - peaked ) , which suggests an easier reorientation of rods as for higher temperatures .",
    "the structure of the network of xyloglucan particles follows the structure of the rods as it is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyl_distr ] , where one can recognize the seven peaks in the distribution of distances within a triplet for all studied temperatures ( for example , we show @xmath79 ) . for low temperatures the distribution is sharper , implying that the network of xyloglucans is less flexible . from these results",
    "we can conclude that the network of xyloglucan changes the optimal structure of the system , inducing glassy features like a broad , or double peaked , angular distribution .",
    "we study the dynamics of our system by calculating the mean - square displacement ( msd ) and the orientational time correlation function of the rods . at all studied temperatures , we find that the slow relaxation processes are well described by power laws and logarithmic functions . in fig .  [",
    "fig : msd ] we show the time dependence of the @xmath80 of rod beads in log - log scale .",
    "this dependence can be described by a power law @xmath81 with exponent @xmath82 ( instead of @xmath83 characteristic for the ballistic regime ) for the initial part ( @xmath84 ) and with a temperature dependent @xmath85 for the slow regime ( @xmath86 ) shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] . the diffusive regime ( @xmath87 ) typical of liquids is never achieved in our simulations since , even at the highest temperature , the value of @xmath88 is less than 0.5 , signaling a slow glassy dynamics of the rods .",
    "moreover , the appearance of a `` plateau '' between the two regimes for @xmath72 corresponds to the emergence of another structurally arrested state , where the rods are trapped by their neighbours .",
    "this confirms that @xmath72 is below the crossover temperature between two glassy phases . by fitting @xmath85 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] ) to a power - law we find @xmath89 . using this approximation",
    ", one can estimate the temperature typical of diffusive dynamics as @xmath90 .",
    "we did not simulate such high temperature , where most xyloglucan bonds would be broken , since this regime is not interesting for cellulose .",
    "we found the following influence of xyloglucan network on the msd at @xmath91 : weakening of x - r bonds changes only slightly the msd , while broken x - x interactions change qualitatively the msd behaviour and seem to suppress the subdiffusive dynamics .",
    "another quantity that can be used to characterize the glassy behaviour is the relaxation of rod orientation given by the following correlation function of the directors @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 stands for the legendre polynomial . from fig .",
    "[ fig : or ] we notice that the above quantity has a behaviour similar to that of the msd with two distinct relaxation processes : an initial fast exponential and slow logarithmic long - time decay .",
    "thus , we fit these curves over the whole time interval with the following expression @xmath95 the fitting parameter @xmath96 that characterizes the slow dynamics is shown as a function of temperature in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : or ] .",
    "the curve @xmath97 saturates for @xmath98 , another sign of a structural rearrangement . above this temperature",
    ", we find an increase of broken x - x bonds from 2% up to 6% at @xmath58 .",
    "the increased number of broken bonds at higher temperature makes the system less frustrated preventing further increase of @xmath96 with temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the slow logarithmic reorientation dynamics persists also above the crossover temperature .",
    "together with the data on strongly subdiffusive translational dynamics at all temperatures , this suggest a crossover between two types of structurally arrested glassy states like the one observed experimentally in a copolymer micellar system  @xcite .",
    "the reorientation of rods depends also on the strength of the x - r interactions .",
    "tenfold weakening of x - r interactions at @xmath91 results in a change of @xmath99 more than that due to an increase of temperature to @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : or ] ) but slow logarithmic dynamics still exists .",
    "conversely , breaking of x - x bonds ( @xmath60 ) leads to a non decaying amorphous behaviour of the orientation of rods and eliminates the slow dynamics completely .",
    "we have studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations a model that captures the main structural features of cellulose .",
    "we have shown that , in a wide range of temperatures , a slow dynamics results from the competition between the microfibrils interactions and the stretchable network of xyloglucan molecules .",
    "the slow dynamics is characterized by logarithmic time dependence of orientational correlators and by strongly subdiffusive dynamics of translational motion .",
    "these two features are robust and were observed for all temperatures investigated , around and below room temperature .",
    "moreover , we have shown that weakening of the microfibril  xyloglucan interactions preserves the slow dynamics but influences the time scale of diffusion and reorentation .",
    "these findings are compatible with the observation of logarithmic creep motion in plant cell walls , also when in presence of ltp that weakens the hydrogen bonds in the network  @xcite .",
    "the loosening effect of ltp , rather than temperature , is thought to be one of the mechanisms that makes the extension of plant cell walls possible  @xcite .",
    "indeed also in our model , variations of temperature around room temperature do not affect noticeably the slow dynamics in the way a weakening of x - r interaction does .",
    "the complexity of our model produces an additional structural transition at low temperature .",
    "we find that a crossover beetween two glassy states , characterized by different angular distributions and parameters of slow dynamics .",
    "a similar glass - glass transition was found in copolymer micellar system  @xcite .",
    "we do not pursue further the study of the nature of this transition , that in our model occurs at low temperatures , not relevant for biological processes .",
    "however , the possibility of more than one structurally arrested state can be relevant for other related biopolymer networks .",
