    "a fundamental question in the theory of evolution has been how cooperation can emerge between selfish members  @xcite .",
    "another question is why evolution takes place in terms of intermittent bursts of activities , which are the characteristics of dynamical systems in a ` critical ' state  @xcite . here",
    ", we propose a generalized bak - sneppen ( bs ) model  @xcite , which may solve the above two puzzles simultaneously .",
    "we take an approach of evolutionary game theory and use the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) games to mimic the interactions among members .",
    "each member is identified by its stochastic strategy , specified by its ( history independent ) cooperation probability ( cp ) . here",
    ", a ` member ' can represent an individual in a species , an agent in an economical system or a species in an ecological system .",
    "the fitness of a member is given by the payoffs of the games with its neighbors .",
    "we then apply bs dynamics and replace the least fit member and its neighbors by new members with random cps .",
    "the neighbors of the non - cooperator are likely to vanish due to its low payoff , but the non - cooperator itself can also be removed through the bs mechanism . as the non - cooperators disappear , the overall cp increases , and a new comer ( with a random cp ) will have a lower cp than the increased average .",
    "therefore , the new comer tends to cause its neighbor to be the least fit , and the replacement activity likely occurs at or near the new comer s site .",
    "this invokes the spatio - temporal correlation between the least fit sites and can explain why replacements are episodic as well as how cooperation emerges .",
    "evolutionary game theory has been one of the most powerful tools in studying the dynamics of evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , a simple straightforward application of game theory can not explain the strong cooperation between  selfish \" replicators observed in nature and society .",
    "for the evolution to construct a new , upper level of organization , cooperation amongst the majority of the population is needed .",
    "however , the game theoretical description of interactions between members usually leads to defections as evolutionarily stable strategies .",
    "natural selection , which has been a fundamental principle of evolution , prefers the species that beat off the others and oppose cooperation .",
    "there have been numerous studies looking for natural mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation among competitive members  @xcite .",
    "recently , nowak presented a state - of - art review on the evolution of cooperation and discussed five known mechanisms : kin selection , direct reciprocity , indirect reciprocity , network reciprocity , and group selection  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies provide the exact conditions for the emergence of cooperation for each of the five mechanisms .",
    "however , such conditions do not seem to be general enough to explain the cooperative phenomena observed everywhere .",
    "for example , for network reciprocity , the benefit - to - cost ratio of a cooperative behavior should be larger than the average degree  @xcite , but this seems to be a rather strong assumption because the degrees are quite large in most cases in real population structures .",
    "also , there have been a great deal of studies on self - organized criticality in game theory  @xcite , but their dynamics leading to the critical states are not directly connected to the emergence of cooperation . here , we consider an evolutionary game on networks and show that cooperation can emerge when the benefit to cost ratio is larger than just 1 if we use the bs process .",
    "when cooperators interact with defectors , they tend to disappear , giving rise to an assortment of cooperators  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this behavior emerges in the long run even with a small `` chain - death '' rate , @xmath0 , where the number of neighbors that get replaced is less than one . for a uniform or random arrangement of cooperators and defectors , more cooperators than defectors disappear for small @xmath0 , but in the long run",
    ", the bs process builds a self - organized structure so that the number of cooperators in the population increases .",
    "an influential model aimed to mimic the interactions between competitive members in a population is the pd game .",
    "it is one of the matrix games between two players who have two possible decisions , cooperation ( @xmath1 ) or defection ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we consider a case in which the payoffs are calculated by the cost @xmath3 and the benefit @xmath4 of a cooperative behavior . if one player defects while the other cooperates , the defector receives benefit @xmath4 without any cost whereas the cooperator pay cost @xmath3 and its payoff becomes @xmath5",
    ". for mutual cooperation , both get benefit @xmath4 , but pay cost @xmath3 , and their payoffs become @xmath6 while the payoffs for mutual defection are 0 .",
    "when we add @xmath3 to all elements so that payoff can be directly interpreted as ( non - negative ) fitness , the payoff matrix becomes @xmath7 where we set @xmath8 without loss of generality . with conventional competition processes , the matrix game shown above",
    "does not , in general , predict the evolution of cooperation .",
    "the birth - death process always predicts an evolution of defection .",
    "cooperation can emerge for death - birth or imitation processes in a structured population , but only with a ( unrealistic ) large value of the benefit - to - cost ratio @xmath4 for real populations  @xcite .    here , we consider the pd game interaction , but introduce the bs mechanism  @xcite as the competition process , and assume that the least fit member and its neighbors are prone to disappear .",
    "each member is characterized by its strategy that determines when to choose the ` decisions ' @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the history - independent stochastic strategies , and the phenotype of a member , say the @xmath9th member , is represented by its cp @xmath10 .",
    "the history independent pure ( deterministic ) strategies , the `` always @xmath1 '' and the `` always @xmath2 '' , correspond to the limits of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the fitness of a member is given by the sum of payoffs from its neighbors , and the member dies out if its total payoff is the minimum .",
    "the died - out site is occupied by a new member with a new cp , which is drawn randomly from 0 to 1 .",
    "neighbors of the least fit site may also be harmed in the process of establishing the steady interaction with the new comer .",

    "we study the strategy evolution of a simple structured population from the initial state of random strategies .",
    "initially , members in the population have cooperation probabilities that are drawn randomly from the uniform distribution of the interval [ 0  1 ] .",
    "they play pd games with their nearest neighbors .",
    "we assume that each member plays sufficiently many games prior to the reproduction process and use the payoff expectation value as its fitness .",
    "the least fit member with the minimum payoff expectation is replaced by a new member with a new random cp .",
    "in addition to the least fit member , the neighbors of the least fit member are also replaced by new members with the probability  @xmath0 .",
    "then , we recalculate the payoff expectations , and replacements occur at the new least fit member and its neighbors .",
    "we continue these processes until the system reaches a steady state and calculate the statistical properties of the population , such as the mean cooperation probability , fitness distribution , avalanche size ( defined later ) distribution and etc .",

    "the exponent obtained from a least - square fit of the form @xmath96 is @xmath97 .",
    "this value is consistent with the known exponent of the 1d bs model  @xcite .",
    "the power law indicates that the evolution occurs in a dynamical criticality  @xcite .",
    "we measure the avalanche distributions for other @xmath0 and @xmath4 and found the critical exponent @xmath98 to be independent of the benefit - to - cost ratio @xmath4 or the chain - death probability @xmath0 .",

    "the distance distribution is measured in the steady states for the system of @xmath92 with @xmath16 . when the distribution @xmath100 is plotted against @xmath99 on a log - log scale , it also becomes a line , indicating power - law distributions @xmath101 with the slop @xmath94 .",
    "this exponent is also consistent with the known exponent of the 1d bs model  @xcite .",
    "it is notable that our model belongs to the same universality class as the bs model in spite of the complexity in computing the fitness of members and the non - trivial dynamics of the population - fitness changes .",
    "we have considered the bs mechanism as a reproduction process with fitness given by a pd game payoff on a network structure .",
    "our observation may have more natural implication in economical systems because the bs process with chain bankruptcy is a more feasible scenario .",
    "it might be worthwhile analyzing weekly or monthly bankruptcy data and see if they follow a power - law distribution as our study suggests .",
    "we have simulated our model with other values of the benefit - to - cost ratio @xmath4 and see that cooperation emerges in a wide range of chain - death rates @xmath0 , as long as @xmath4 is larger than  1 .",
    "in contrast to a common belief , cooperation can emerge even with parameters that a population with random strategies decreases cooperation .",
    "this is possible because the bs mechanism builds dynamical correlations that suppress the long - term survival of non - cooperators even in the region where mean - field calculation predicts a decrease in cooperators .",
    "the same dynamical correlation leads to soc in replacement activities with the same exponents as the original bs model .",
    "the strategy space presented here is rather small .",
    "mixed but only history independent strategies are considered on a very simple population structure , a 1d lattice . however , we speculate that our main results , the emergence of cooperation and soc , are robust under variations in the population structure or the strategy space extension .",
    "in fact , the preliminary results with the extended strategy space show that the emergence of cooperation appears more easily and rapidly when the reactive strategies are included .",
