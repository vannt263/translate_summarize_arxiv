    "about fifty years ago , the development of the bcs theory @xcite and its overwhelming success in physics and application was a breakthrough in modern theoretical physics .",
    "this theory provides basic insight into superconductivity from a quantum - mechanical point of view . according to the bcs mechanism",
    ", the superconducting phase is due to the condensation of bosonic quasi - particles , called cooper pairs , which are created from fermions that experience an effective weak attractive interaction .",
    "an essential ingredient of the bcs theory was the observation @xcite that there could be a phonon - mediated attraction between electrons in some metals at low temperatures .",
    "this effective force acts at longer distances than the short - range screened coulomb interaction . in the simplified version of the model @xcite ,",
    "the attractive interaction is constant in a narrow energy region ( of the order of the debye energy @xmath0 ) around the fermi energy and zero outside .",
    "as the extent of a cooper pair exponentially increases with decreasing coupling , a large number of cooper pair wave functions usually overlap with each other . in the extreme limit of vanishing attractive coupling @xmath1 ,",
    "the non - perturbative bcs theory becomes exact .",
    "the attractive interaction between fermions may originate from quite different sources .",
    "since the effective attraction could be due not only to phonons but also to other bosonic excitations , the bcs approach has been successfully applied to many quite different research fields .",
    "unfortunately , the basic physics of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite does not fit into any weak - coupling schema and therefore also not into the bcs theory .",
    "the measured transition temperature @xmath2 in cuprates , which can reach 160  k , can not be derived from realistic bcs calculations .",
    "regardless of this disadvantage , it is not exaggerated to state that the bcs theory has deepened our understanding of many - body effects in the quantum world .",
    "the non - perturbative character of the approach , as revealed by the highly nonlinear dependence of the transition temperature or the gap energy on the coupling constant @xmath1 , expresses the fact that the superconducting phase is to be understood as a complex many - body phenomenon , to which an infinite number of particular particle correlations contribute .",
    "in addition , the resulting cooper pairs , which carry the superconducting current , do not exist as spatially separated entities but are collected into large drops , in which novel collective quantum effects could exist in principle . however , the bcs approach focuses on pair correlations meaning that the behavior of more than two highly correlated quantum objects is described by two - body interactions between all possible pairs .",
    "the question arises whether this first approximation is exhaustive for the description of many - body quantum effects .",
    "in fact , many - body interactions have been studied in different research areas like nuclear , atomic , and condensed matter physics .",
    "the main reason usually is the treatment of cluster effects created by an ensemble of strongly correlated particles ( especially self - consistent cluster approximations @xcite ) . in the field of nuclear physics",
    "there is growing evidence that three - body forces exist among the nucleons inside atomic nuclei . in condensed - matter physics",
    ", many - body effects of trions were studied  @xcite and three - body forces were shown to dominate the cauchy discrepancies in the second and third order elastic constants of copper .",
    "@xcite three - body contributions to the interatomic potential also modify many properties of the liquid and solid phases of @xmath3he atoms .",
    "@xcite even a spectacular result have been reported in the field of many - body interaction @xcite namely that a @xmath4-dimensional hamiltonian with two- and three - body interactions has a unique string - like ground state , when the strength of the three - body coupling exceeds a critical value . in a recent study of the bose - einstein condensate - bcs crossover in fermionic systems @xcite , the schrdinger equation for four attractively interacting fermions",
    "was solved by applying bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "the solution reveals a robust four - fermion cluster that is not broken by collision and does not couple to additional fermionic states .",
    "the mentioned papers initiated a study of the rich and interesting quantum physics that refers to many - body interaction .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to contribute to this fascinating field by treating a bcs - like instability in an electron gas with four fermion coupling .",
    "the bcs theory is based on the pair approximation with an effective particle - particle coupling that is attractive and phonon mediated .",
    "similarly , it is conceivable that also a cluster of three fermions is glued together by an attracting three - body coupling .",
    "however , due to its fermionic character , these aggregates are not expected to form a condensate .",
    "one needs two or four fermion complexes for their transmutation into boson - like objects , which could give rise to a phase transition to a superconductor . here , we focus on an instability , which is due to the conglomerate of four fermions described by an effective potential @xmath5 . in order to concentrate on possible instabilities in the system , both pair- and higher - order particle interactions",
    "are not taken into account .",
