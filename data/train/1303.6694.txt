    "a time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite is a high - resolution detector providing three - dimensional tracking of charged particles even in very high multiplicity environments such as heavy ion collisions , e.g.  at the alice experiment at cern s lhc @xcite .",
    "the large number of space points measured along each particle track considerably eases the task of pattern recognition for complex events , and in addition allows the identification of each particle by measuring its specific energy loss . since track reconstruction requires a precise knowledge of the electric and magnetic fields inside the chamber , distortions have to be kept at a minimum . to this end ,",
    "tpcs are normally used in a gated mode , where an electrostatic grid blocks the ions created in the amplification stage , usually an array of proportional wires , before they reach the drift volume .",
    "this introduces inevitable dead times and limits the maximum trigger rate to a few khz .",
    "after the second long shutdown of the lhc in 2018 , a luminosity for pb - pb collisions of @xmath4 is expected . in order to make full use of the increase in luminosity , alice plans to record all minimum bias events at a rate of about @xmath2 @xcite , about two orders of magnitude higher than at present . as a result",
    "particle tracks from 5 events on average will be superimposed in the drift volume .",
    "a continuous , untriggered readout of the tpc is the obvious mode of operation , precluding the use of a gating grid .",
    "the use of gas electron multiplier foils @xcite instead of proportional wires offers an intrinsic suppression of the ion backflow @xcite , although not to the level of @xmath5 as with a gating grid .",
    "suppression factors around or below the percent level have been reached @xcite , but strongly depend on the gas composition and the magnetic field . together with low - noise readout electronics , allowing an operation at gas gains of the order of @xmath6 , this results in about @xmath7 ions drifting back into the drift volume per electron arriving at the amplification stage .",
    "the drift distortions caused by the ion space charge have been shown in simulations to be of the order of a few @xmath1 , which can be corrected using standard calibration techniques @xcite , provided the ion charge distribution is stable over time scales of the order of @xmath8 .    in order to minimize distortions for the case of the alice tpc , which operates in a low solenoid field of @xmath9 , measurements of the crucial ion backflow ( @xmath10 ) , defined as the ratio of cathode to anode current , have been performed in triple gem detectors with ar- and ne - based gas mixtures without magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ fig : ib - vs - eind_ar-70_co2 - 30 ] shows this quantity for an ar / co@xmath11 ( 70/30 ) mixture as a function of the induction field , i.e.  the field between the last gem and the readout anode .",

    "requires a higher drift field ( @xmath20 ) and lower fields between gems ( @xmath21 in order not to enter a regime of charge amplification ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath10 is higher by about a factor of 5 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ib - vs - et2_ne-90_co2 - 10 ] .",

    "in the framework of the panda experiment at fair a prototype gem - tpc has been built which is the largest detector of this kind to date @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fopi.tpc ] shows a cross section of the detector , which has a drift length of @xmath28 , and an inner ( outer ) diameter of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) . signals from the triple gem amplification region are induced on 10254 hexagonal anode pads , chosen in order to optimize the spatial resolution for all possible track directions .",
    "the after / t2k chip @xcite is used to sample the analog signals at a frequency of @xmath31 .",
    "the detector has been commissioned with cosmics and particle beams at the fopi experiment at gsi , and was recently employed for physics measurements with pion beams .",
    "the performance of the gem - tpc , operated with a gas mixture of ar / co@xmath11 ( 90/10 ) , fully matches the expectations with a spatial resolution of @xmath32 for small drift distances ( fig .  [",
