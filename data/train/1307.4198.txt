    "these could be supernovae , such as from core - collapse of a massive star at its terminal phase of stellar evolution ( _ supernova types ii and ib , ic _ ) , thermonuclear supernovae related to disruptions of a white dwarf star ( _ supernovae type ia _ ) , or novae , which are thermonuclear events on the surface of a white dwarf star , which are not disruptive to the host star itself ( reviews and more detail on supernova variants can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thermonuclear events on more - compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes will be less likely to lead to significant expansion of the nuclear - burning site , and thus remain non - transparent to gamma - rays produced herein ; on neutron star surfaces , such events are termed _ type - i x - ray bursts _ @xcite . also , some products of nuclear burning in the cores of normal stars may , under special circumstances , be mixed out to the stellar surface , and hence be released as part of the stellar wind , e.g. in the wolf - rayet phase of stars more massive than about 25  m@xmath8 .",

    "we focus on spectral signatures rather than continuum emission .",
    "such high - energy collisions occur in interstellar space through cosmic - ray bombardment of interstellar gas , but also near cosmic relativistic - particle accelerators such as solar flares , supernova remnants , pulsar wind nebulae , accreting binaries and supermassive black holes , and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "often , in these sites , continuum processes dominate in brightness , and therefore only in solar flares have the characteristic spectral - line signatures from nuclear transitions been detected up to now .",

    "this characteristic emission has been mapped to occur in an extended region throughout the inner parts of our galaxy , has been reported also from a few transient events in compact sources , and has been observed in great detail from solar flares @xcite .",
    "at gamma - ray energies , interactions with the detector material of the astronomical telescope have a character different from lower energies : up to x - ray energies , photons interact within a small volume , while at gamma - ray energies the penetration depth into any material is macroscopic , of size mm to cm .",
    "therefore , the mirror or lens optics which characterizes astronomical telescopes at lower energies ( or longer wavelengths ) becomes unfeasible , and the aperture of the telescope is identical to the detector s surface area .",
    "the detector itself , correspondingly , converts the photon energy into a signal across a macroscopic depth range rather than a thin surface region .",
    "the physical processes which are responsible for such interaction are    \\(1 ) compton scattering , i.e. the inelastic scattering of the incident photon on an electron , which produces a secondary photon with reduced energy and an energized secondary electron , and    \\(2 ) pair production , i.e. the conversion of the electromagnetic energy of the photon into a pair of electron and anti - electron ( positron ) in the electric field of a nucleus of the detector material .",
    "pair production has a threshold energy of 1.022  mev , the rest mass of the pair of electron and positron . the excess energy and momentum of the incident photon",
    "are distributed to the pair of particles , and thus the tracks of these ionizing particles can be traced with appropriate detectors .",
    "bremsstrahlung may convert some of the particle energy of the secondary into photon energy , however , and may complicate tracking due to the larger range of photons in material compared to the charged leptons .",
    "compton scattering results in a secondary photon , with an energy of about the same order of magnitude as the primary photon , hence with a similar range within the detector before a second interaction and partial energy deposit occurs .",
    "therefore , successive compton scatterings and their total range constitute the upper end of the required detector size .",
    "the interaction depth will vary from photon to photon , reproducing the probability distribution given by the effects of compton scattering ( between about 0.1 and about 2 mev ) and pair production ( at higher energies ) , respectively .",
    "but event by event , interaction depths will vary by macroscopic amounts .",
    "this leads to a degradation of imaging resolution , from the scatter of interaction depth in the detector pixel .",
    "similarly , spectroscopic resolution depends on the homogeneity of energy deposits and its conversion into the signal amplitude across the pixel depth ( and area ) . at the high - resolution limit , the intrinsic energy distribution of the electrons in the detector material , with which the photon interacts , sets a lower limit on energy resolution : atomic electrons which compton - scatter the incident photon will have different energies according to their atomic orbits , and impose statistical fluctuations at the tens - ev level to the energy of the secondary electron from such compton scatter , which together with the secondary photon carries the energy of the incident photon .",
    "the secondary photons and particles which are characteristic for high - energy interaction processes of photons with materials have energies below and up to the primary photon s energy , say mev .",
    "in contrast to detectors at gev energies or above , the number of secondaries is rather small , and the number of total interactions from the primary interaction down to deposition of the total energy of the primary photon also is relatively small . in gev detectors , secondaries produce copious secondary ionization , and , since energies are large , one may add thick passive intervening mass layers into the path of secondaries to simply multiply their number , thus enhancing the ionization trace of secondaries . at mev energies ,",
    "each single interactions is precious and should be measured with as much precision as feasible , to maximize the information about the primary photon , specifically about its energy and its arrival direction .    for these reasons ,",
    "the technology of _ compton telescopes _ has been assessed to be most promising and effective as an astronomical instrument . here",
    ", a large active detector volume ensures that both primary and secondary interactions can be measured in sufficient detail through measurements of energy depositions and momentum vectors .",
    "still , the interpretation of these signals is not straightforward , as the compton scattering , bremsstrahlung , and pair processes can not be inverted directly into reconstruction of the primary photon s energy and arrival direction @xcite . the statistical fluctuations inherent to measurements of energy deposits and track directions add to the resolution limitations of detector elements in spatial and energy dimensions , and are responsible for instrumental limitations .",
    "additionally , the lack of focusing and therefore identity of photon detection and collection areas imply that the instrumental background present in the detector itself is more important , not being suppressed by a collection / detection enhancement factor which is common to other telescopes",
    ". moreover , instrumental background dominates the total number of measured events , and those are difficult to disentangle from the few desired cosmic - photon detection events .",
    "this is due to the physical origins of background , which are mostly the same processes that also create cosmic photons of interest : high - energy particle collisions from cosmic - ray bombardment of the instrument and its supporting structures result in continuum photons as well as nuclear line emission , as discussed above .",
    "the _ prompt _ background events can be rejected when the primary charged particle or cosmic ray can be detected with a suitable detector system , and used in anti - coincidence to eliminate detection events which occur within a short time window after the high - energy particle traversal .",
    "but _ delayed _ background events from short- or long - lived radioactivities or nuclear excitations can not be rejected .",
    "these must be identified from their behavior in data space and their characteristics , as they might differ systematically from cosmic photon events .",
    "such filtering is not perfect , due to statistical broadening of signals , and also may eliminate some desired cosmic photon events .",
    "therefore , the processing of gamma - ray detector signals and rejection / suppression of background is complex , and often a major threshold for astronomers to make use of mev gamma - ray telescope data in broader studies .",
    "mev gamma - ray spectroscopy is mostly done by a small group of astrophysicists which also are specialists in such instruments .",
    "cosmic gamma - ray spectroscopy was initiated by space exploration programs and nuclear radiation detectors in the 1960ies .",
    "the first cosmic lines reported were the positron annihilation line near 500  kev from the sun and from the galaxy , later the detection of interstellar decay of @xmath2al , and the first detection of supernova radioactivity gamma - rays in sn1987a .",
    "broader studies of the gamma - ray sky were then undertaken through nasa s compton gamma - ray observatory mission ( 1991 - 2000 ) , and through esa s international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) mission .",
    "gamma - rays from the sun and its flares had been studied with the solar maximum mission ( smm ) ( 1980 - 1989 ) and its scintillator - based gamma - ray spectrometer instrument ( forrest et al .",
    "1980 ) , and later with the reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; 2002present ) @xcite , which featured ge detectors and corresponding high ( kev - type ) spectral resolution at gamma - ray energies .",
    "several balloon - borne instruments contributed also significant spectroscopy results , such as the ge detector equipped experiments of gris @xcite and hexagone @xcite in the 90ies , and more recently the tgrs experiment on the wind spacecraft @xcite and the nuclear compton telescope ( nct ) balloon experiment @xcite .",
    "cgro had two gamma - ray spectroscopy instruments on board , the comptel compton telescope @xcite , and the osse spectrometer @xcite ; both featured a modest spectral resolution of order 10% ( fwhm ) .",
    "this is inadequate for any gamma - ray spectroscopy in the sense of identifying new lines or constraining kinematics of source regions through line shape measurements , as we now know from high - resolution instruments based on semiconductor detectors , such as integral s spi spectrometer which provide resolutions of @xmath7  0.1% .",
    "the grse instrument which was originally foreseen to address nuclear - line spectroscopy on this spacecraft , was removed during mission preparation following cost overruns . a nuclear astrophysics explorer ( nae) @xcite mission was discussed for a while , and was integrated later through a gamma - ray spectrometer into esa s integral mission concept @xcite .",
    "but the first - generation instruments on cgro were essential in exploration of the gamma - ray sky , and comptel s imaging capabilities at mev energies are still the best we have .",
    "the integral space mission of esa @xcite is a current example of cosmic gamma - ray instrumentation .",
    "the satellite platform hosts two main instruments employing the coded - mask technique of imaging , the spi spectrometer and the ibis imager , in addition to monitor instruments , the jem - x coded - mask x - ray telescope addressing lower energies with a wider field of view , the omc optical monitor camera for simultaneous optical exposure of the target sky regions , and the irem charged - particle monitor detector system recording the cosmic - ray irradiation .",
    "the field of view of the main instruments are of similar size of order 10@xmath9(ibis 9x9@xmath9 , spi 16x16@xmath9 , fully - coded parts , corner - to - corner ) .",
    "the large field of view is defined by the hexagonal arrangements of the 19-element ge detector camera ( 70  mm deep , 55  mm wide detectors , covering a densely - packed 268  mm wide camera plane ) and the 127-element tungsten mask with 6  cm wide elements , which is placed 170  cm above the camera itself .",
    "_ dithering _ the satellite pointing direction around a celestial target direction in @xmath7  2@xmath9steps helps to add more modulation to the sky signal , so it can be separated from the ( @xmath7  constant ) instrumental background .",
    "the background should not vary within small attitude changes , and a very eccentric 3-day orbital period reaching far out and away from radiation belts ( maximum distance from earth 150,000  km)was chosen to provide slow background variations .",
    "typically , the satellite pointing is changed every @xmath7  1800  s , and observations way vary from tens of ks to ms , depending on science target .",
    "the spi spectrometer is integral s instrument for gamma - ray spectroscopy .",
    "it features a set of 19 coaxial ge detectors operating in the energy range 158000  kev , with a detection area of 250  @xmath10 total and a nominal sensitivity of @xmath7  3  10@xmath11  ph  @xmath12s@xmath13 ( 3@xmath14 , 1  ms observing time .",
    "spi s energy resolution is typically e/@xmath15e=500 or 3  kev at 13001800  kev , due to high - purity n - type ge semiconductor detectors operated at @xmath7  80  k and @xmath7  4  kv , with annealings maintaining this spectral performance .",
    "this allows spectroscopy of nuclear lines through unambiguous identification of line energies .",
    "other current facilities in the field of cosmic gamma - ray spectroscopy include the rhessi solar observatory @xcite , the gamma - ray burst monitor scintillation detectors ( modest energy resolution ( 10% fwhm ) ) aboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray satellite launched in june 2008 @xcite , and the nustar mission @xcite launched in june 2012 and equipped with a focusing hard x - ray mirror and detectors operating between 6 and 79 kev , thus including lines from radioactive decay of @xmath1ti at 68 and 78  kev , the lowest - energy lines known from any cosmic radioactive decay .",
    "detectors for gamma - ray spectrometry in the 0.1  mev to gev range could be based on scintillators , solid - state detectors , drift or time projection chambers , and trackers made up of spark chambers or solid state detector stacks .",
    "the physical challenge is to produce a cascade of inelastic interactions of the primary photon and its secondaries within the volume of the detector , and to produce an electrical signal which is proportional to the total energy deposit of the cascade .",
    "high levels of background radiation lead to detectors which respond quickly , and have short dead times .    here , scintillation detectors have an advantage .",
    "the issue with scintillation detectors is to ensure a homogeneous and linear light collection over the volume of the scintillation detector .",
    "imperfections result in different signal amplitudes per energy deposit , depending on the location of interactions within the detector volume .",
    "the spectral resolution required for identification of gamma - ray lines and relating them to specific nuclear transitions practically can only be achieved through solid state detectors .",
    "solid state detectors operate through collection of the charge liberated from photon interactions as electrons are activated into the conduction band . in semiconductor detectors ,",
    "a small band gap of few ev only allows very sensitive high - resolution detectors .",
    "germanium detectors have been established as standard in terrestrial nuclear - physics experiments , and also space borne cosmic gamma - ray experiments ; ge detectors have been reviewed recently @xcite . in recent years , cdzntl detectors have become popular , because they can be operated at room temperature , rather than the cryogenic temperatures required for ge detectors , at nearly similar performance .",
    "charge collection implies propagation of electrons and holes within the detector volume , which is achieved through an electric field between the two electrodes of the detector .",
    "depending on detector and electrode geometry , charge collection also may be inhomogeneous across the detector volume , thus limiting spectral resolution .",
    "moreover , bombardment with cosmic rays in the typical space environment where such detectors for cosmic photons are operated will destroy the crystal properties locally within the detector volume , thus producing traps for charge transport and therefore impeding charge collection with cumulative cosmic - ray exposure .",
    "figure [ fig : spi_annealings ] demonstrates this effect for the spi detectors on integral , showing the resolution for an instrumental line at 1764  kev as a function of time ( in units of satellite orbits called revolutions which last 3 days each ) over ten years .",
    "the degradations are repaired through annealings every few months : here , the entire detector platform is heated from cryogenic operational temperatures around 80  k to about 370k for 10 - 14 days , thus curing the crystal defects which impeded charge collection .",
    "the spectral response of the ge detectors on spi is monitored and stored in precise detail , from many instrumental lines fitted by a parametrized representation of the response to photons of specific energy .",
    "the response function is composed of a gaussian centered at the incoming photon energy , a step function from this energy towards lower energies , and a one - sided exponential from the incoming photon energy downward to represent the degrading charge collection efficiency .",
    "figure [ fig : spi_degradation ] shows how the degradation thus is extracted in consistent and precise detail . from a set of instrumental - background lines , the spectral response is decomposed into a nearly - gaussian part plus a one - sided exponential that describes degradation of charge collection",
    "this response is then used in spectroscopic analysis later on .",
    "spectroscopy at mev energies suffers from a dominance of instrumental background in measured events , the cosmic photons of interest contribute only a small ratio of events at the percentage level or below .",
    "typical source intensities in lines are 10@xmath16  ph  @xmath12s@xmath13 for the strongest line at 511 kev to 10@xmath17  ph  @xmath12s@xmath13 for the weakest lines detected so far ( from @xmath3fe decay ) , and many predicted lines from objects of interest are about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude fainter still .",
    "thus , a critical component of cosmic gamma - ray spectroscopy is the determination of the instrumental background as it may vary across the months of typical exposure times needed to collect the cosmic photons from sources of interest .",
    "the physical processes which cause the instrumental background are rather clear : cosmic ray and secondary energetic - particle interactions with the spacecraft and instrument materials causing inelastic high - energy photon production and nuclear excitations .",
    "nevertheless , the prediction of instrumental backgrounds from software implementations of such physical processes ( e.g. geant ) fail to achieve the required precision of better than a % -range precision , with their typical uncertainties of 30% .",
    "these uncertainties derive from unknown energetic - particle spectra and flux variations , and from limitations in modeling the spacecraft and instrument in its geometry and materials composition at sufficient precision ; small admixtures of specific isotopes are often responsible for the strongest background lines .",
    "moreover , those energetic particle interactions also create radioactive isotopes within the spacecraft which are not part of the materials library of these software packages , as they have been established from terrestrial high - energy physics experiments .",
    "therefore , the method of choice for background determination is empirical fitting of models which describe the background in its spectral and temporal variations . the main challenge is to find a background representation which is orthogonal , or rather least degenerate , with variations of the cosmic photon signal .",
    "figure [ fig : spi_eventrate ] shows the count rate variation over ten years of the spi detectors on integral .",
    "the general increase of background over the first years corresponds to a decline of solar activity , as energetic particles from the sun ( solar wind ) change the morphology of the earth s magnetosphere . in near - earth orbits of space satellites , therefore in phases of high solar activity the shielding of cosmic rays is more effective .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spi_eventrate ] from background declining again as the solar activity picks up in cycle # 24 after the year 2010 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sunspots ] ) . superimposed",
    "are short - term rate variations , which arise from solar flare events , or magnetic storm particle events which expose the satellite to an increased particle flux for a short time .",
    "additionally , the approach of radiation belts at the perigee of the satellite orbit leads to strongly - increased energetic particle irradiations ; but here the instrument is turned off to avoid damages from saturations , so that only a declining activation signature from this perigee exposure can be seen after the instrument is turned on again leaving the radiation belt zones .",
    "the integral orbit has been chosen to have a high eccentricity with an apogee of about 150,000  km , so that the few minutes of post - perigee activation decline are rather negligible and background generally is stable across days of this 3-day orbit .",
    "for modeling of instrumental backgrounds , it had turned out to be most effective to make use of other , independent , detectors of energetic - particle - flux related events near the cosmic photon detectors . in the case of spi ,",
    "the rate of saturated events in ge detectors has proven valuable , as has the rate of charged - particle detections in the anticoincidence shield detector ( based on bgo scintillator material ) and a veto detector plate below the coded mask ( which is based on a plastic scintillator ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , ge detector counts in continuum energy bands adjacent to the line of interest proved valuable . but",
    "all of these _ tracers _ of instrumental background have been found to change their functional relation to background on time scales of days , thus require scaling parameters to be fitted during the cosmic source exposures .",
    "therefore , a typical spectroscopy study with spi consists of fitting a multi - parameter model to observed spectral counts per the ge detector set and thousands of 30-minute pointings of overlapping sky regions .",
    "the model includes instrumental background through a few tracer components adjusted at different time intervals , and a spatial - distribution model of the cosmic photon sources of interest , which is folded through the instrument s imaging response to predict the cosmic event contribution .",
    "once the intensity scaling of the cosmic source is determined in fine energy bins across the line of interest , the spectral response is then accounted for to determine the line position and shape parameters for the cosmic source .",
    "an illustration of this procedure can be found below , from the detailed spectroscopy of the celestial @xmath2alline .",
    "understanding the progenitor systems and the dynamics of the carbon - burning triggered explosion of supernovae of type ia is motivated by two main reasons .",
    "snia are the dominating sources of cosmic iron and similar elements , and therefore key to the metal enrichment of the universe .",
    "snia also are key to current cosmology studies , being used as standardizable sources with known intrinsic brightness for tracing cosmological expansion @xcite .",
    "but up to now , no consistent physical explanation of snia explosions has been established , in spite of many proposed scenarios and progenitors .",
    "currently - discussed models are ( i ) explosions triggered in white dwarf central regions as the chandrasekhar mass limit is reached , ( ii ) explosions triggered by an off - center event such as a he - shell flash on white dwarfs of a broader mass range , and ( iii ) explosions resulting from merging of two white dwarfs as it may terminate the evolution of a binary system .",
    "more complex scenarios of binary evolution with recurrent pulsations culminating in a supernova are also discussed @xcite . in all cases",
    ", the runaway nuclear carbon burning will provide the energy which disrupts the white dwarf ; this is the commonly agreed part of snia models ( see@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the issues discussed relate to the nuclear c - burning flame propagation in the different density regimes , between the core of the white dwarf and the exploding outer layers . as a result",
    ", the snia nuclear ashes may range from almost - pure ( near 1  m@xmath8 ) @xmath0ni as it would result from complete burning in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , through deflagration with nse and incomplete - nse burning , down to @xmath0ni amounts below 0.1  m@xmath8and mostly intermediate - mass element ashes resulting from partial burning , such as expected for double - degenerate merger or detonation models @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the spatial distribution of @xmath0ni ashes may range from central - only to distribution throughout the entire exploding supernova .",
    "the initial brightness of snia is due to the sudden deposition of the explosion energy of @xmath7  10@xmath18erg .",
    "but soon , after a few days , supernova brightness dominated by the energy deposition of gamma - rays and positrons from radioactive decay of @xmath0ni .",
    "clearly , the brightness critically depends on how @xmath0ni deposits its radioactive energy into the gas of the rapidly - expanding envelope , leading to thermal emission of the envelope gas at its ( inward - moving ) photosphere .",
    "a ( bolometric , thermal - emission ) luminosity maximum is obtained at @xmath7  20 days after explosion in optical emission .",
    "radiation propagation models are used to relate this low - energy photon emission to the original @xmath0ni and its radioactive energy deposition ( @xmath73  mev per decay of a @xmath0ni nucleus ) @xcite .",
    "measurements of the total @xmath0ni content through gamma - rays are more direct , and rather independent ( at times > 100 days ) of the density structure of the expanding supernova .",
    "the expanding supernova becomes transparent to gamma - rays on a time scale of @xmath7  100  days , so that @xmath0ni decay energy deposition fades .",
    "the rise of radioactive gamma - ray luminosity , as well as gamma - ray line shapes and line - to - continuum ratio convey information about the large - scale spatial distribution of @xmath0ni and the envelope structure .",
    "typically , the gamma - ray luminosity maximum is expected at 7090  days after explosion , much later than the luminosity maximum in thermal ( optical to infrared emission ) supernova light .",
    "the apparent optical luminosity fading with a @xmath7  100-day time constant thus is fortuitous , and results from radioactive decay of @xmath0ni through @xmath0co to @xmath0fe convolved with energy deposition properties of the rapidly - expanding supernova envelope .",
    "sufficiently - nearby events , closer than about 5  mpc , should occur once every 23 years ( as estimated by @xcite from different sn rate proxies in the local universe ) , although numbers vary by factors @xmath7  2 depending on the assumptions about the supernova rate in this more - heterogeneous population of nearby galaxies .    the cgro mission in 19912000 had two opportunities : sn1991 t occurred early in the mission , at a distance of 13 mpc the detected hint for the characteristic gamma - ray lines appeared surprising .",
    "but it was quickly recognized that sn1991 t was an anomalously - bright event also from other observed phenomena , and hence not typical for snia .",
    "the second event during the cgro mission was sn1998bu at @xmath7  17  mpc .",
    "it was much fainter , and no gamma - ray emission could be detected .        during the integral mission ,",
    "two snia were close enough for useful integral observations , but no signal could be found .",
    "sn2003gs probably was much too distant , at 16  mpc .",
    "sn2011fe occurred on august 24 , 2010 , in the nearby galaxy m101/ngc5457 @xcite , at a distance of 6.4 mpc . with lines likely to be significantly broadened ,",
    "the high spectral resolution does not help , considering the instrumental - background level .",
    "integral observed sn2011fe for 4  ms total , only to provide upper limits @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sn2011fe ] ) .",
    "thus , after the comptel and integral gamma - ray telescopes operating for 20 years , snia gamma - rays still have not contributed to help understand snia .",
    "a significant advance in sensitivity is needed to not depend only on luck with sufficiently nearby events , to below 10@xmath17  ph  @xmath12s@xmath13 as shown in several proposed mission concepts ( see esa s cosmic - vision program selection , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "massive stars with initial masses above 810  m@xmath8evolve through a series of central nuclear fusion stages beyond hydrogen burning up to silicon burning .",
    "as this energy reservoir of the release of nuclear binding energy is exhausted eventually , gravitational collapse will terminate this evolution after 10100  my @xcite .",
    "the collapse occurs on a time scale of seconds , once either central nuclear burning starves from exhaustion of the fuel for energy - liberating fusion reactions or electron capture sets in and takes away the pressure support from the ( degenerated ) electron gas .",
    "infalling nuclei are decomposed in the shock wave above the newly - forming neutron star into nucleons and @xmath19  particles , which consumes part of the gravitational energy , but neutrinos emitted by the neutron star that forms in the interior of the collapsing star probably lead to sufficient energy deposits in the infalling matter to trigger an explosion .",
    "how exactly this occurs is a matter of current studies and debate .",
    "it appears to be the result of instabilities in infalling and expanding gas flows within the delicate balance of gravitational , nuclear reaction , neutrino interaction , and hydrodynamical flow energies .",
    "clumps and jets may be part of such explosions , as observed in several core - collapse supernova remnants .",
    "nuclear reactions are expected to occur in the dense shock region approaching nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , hence producing fe - group elements and also substantial amounts of radioactive @xmath0ni . at the same time , in regions nearer to the neutron star , neutrino interactions with nuclei occur in the _ @xmath20-process _ and mainly liberate nucleons from nuclei , thus stimulating proton and neutron capture reactions of remaining nuclei . further out ,",
    "decomposition of in falling matter will also provide abundant free nucleons and @xmath19-particles , and thus add an _",
    "@xmath19-rich _ flavor to nuclear burning .",
    "once the explosion sets in , material will expand and cool , and nuclear burning will _ freeze out_. yet , the explosion will drive a shock through the outer envelope beyond the core , before these parts could take notice of the inner collapse , and some _ explosive nucleosynthesis _ will occur in those shock - heated regions .",
    "this explosive nucleosynthesis is characterized by short nuclear burning times which lead to large deviations from equilibrium and hydrostatic nuclear burning patterns .",
    "altogether , one expects that abundant oxygen , silicon , and iron - group nuclei will be ejected , mixed with small but important contributions of heavy element products from the neutrino - driven wind zone .",
    "radioactive ejecta which could be observed with gamma - ray spectrometers include @xmath0ni and @xmath1ti , at estimated amounts of @xmath7  0.1 and @xmath7  few  10@xmath21  m@xmath8 , respectively .",

    "<S> penetrating gamma - rays require complex instrumentation for astronomical spectroscopy measurements of gamma - rays from cosmic sources . </S>",
    "<S> multiple - interaction detectors in space combined with sophisticated post - processing of detector events on ground have lead to a spectroscopy performance which is now capable to provide new astrophysical insights . </S>",
    "<S> spectral signatures in the mev regime originate from transitions in the nuclei of atoms ( rather than in their electron shell ) . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear transitions are stimulated by either radioactive decays or high - energy nuclear collisions such as with cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> gamma - ray lines have been detected from radioactive isotopes produced in nuclear burning inside stars and supernovae , and from energetic - particle interactions in solar flares . </S>",
    "<S> radioactive - decay gamma - rays from @xmath0ni directly reflect the source of supernova light . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1ti is produced in core - collapse supernova interiors , and the paucity of corresponding @xmath1ti gamma - ray line sources reflects the variety of dynamical conditions herein . @xmath2al and @xmath3fe are dispersed in interstellar space from massive - star nucleosynthesis over millions of years . </S>",
    "<S> gamma - rays from their decay are measured in detail by gamma - ray telescopes , astrophysical interpretations reach from massive - star interiors to dynamical processes in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear de - excitation gamma - ray lines have been found in solar - flare events , and convey information about energetic - particle production in these events , and their interaction in the solar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation of positrons leads to another type of cosmic gamma - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic annihilation gamma - rays at 511 kev have been measured long ago in solar flares , and now throughout the interstellar medium of our milky way galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> but now a puzzle has appeared , as a surprising predominance of the central bulge region was determined . </S>",
    "<S> this requires either new positron sources or transport processes not yet known to us . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss instrumentation and data processing for cosmic gamma - ray spectroscopy , and the astrophysical issues and insights from these measurements . </S>"
