    "economic changes characterized by rural abandonment and consequent homogenization of landscape with fire prone  shrublands , have combined to favor an increase in occurrence of large and devastating wildfires @xcite .",
    "roughly 80% of annual burnt area tends to occur during 1015 days in the fire season , under the influence of well characterized atmospheric circulation pattern dominated by a ridge over the iberian peninsula @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that in portugal , and over the period between 1980 and 2000 , the relative importance of human and climatic drivers in space and in time .",
    "their results point towards the existence of a dynamic interaction between socioeconomic and landscape fire drivers suggesting that , while climate promotes favorable fire conditions across the entire country , socioeconomic and landscape factors determine a large portion of the complex fire patterns found at a regional scale .",
    "+ independently from their drivers , wildfire patterns at landscape scale have important management implications @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been widely shown that landscape fuel reduction treatments will only be successful if strategically placed in order to intersect fire spread in the heading direction @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite assessed the existence of preferential fire perimeter orientation at watershed level , to support the spatial layout of fuelbreak networks .",
    "their analysis identified clusters of watersheds where fire perimeters are preferentially aligned along the ne / sw and the se / nw axes .",
    "those watersheds include fire perimeters that together account for roughly 65% of the overall burnt area in portugal , over the period between 1975 and 2005 , while in the remaining watersheds fire perimeters are aligned randomly . in figure [ fig3 ] ,",
    "some descriptive maps on the data of interest are displayed .",
    "the left plot shows the total area burnt in each watershed , whereas the middle plot represents the mean slope of the fires in each region .",
    "finally , the right plot indicates which watersheds exhibit a preferred fire orientation , versus a random orientation , according to @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that spatial patterns of fire perimeter orientation found in the 31year dataset could be explained by dominant weather during the portuguese fire season @xcite .",
    "however , given that fire perimeter orientation analysis is event  based , i.e. it is based on the orientation of each fire event , all perimeters are treated equally independently of their size . in this paper ,",
    "a test for assessing independence between wildfire size and orientation is presented , complementing the work of @xcite .",

    "a new family of circular  linear distributions based on nonnegative trigonometric sums , which proved to be more flexible in capturing the data structure , was proposed by @xcite , adapting the method by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite exploited the copula representation of the @xcite family , allowing for a completely nonparametric estimator , which was applied to analyze so@xmath1 concentrations and wind direction in a site close to a power plant .",

    "hence , an alternative route relies on a proper design of a resampling scheme .",
    "bearing these premises in mind , the following issues must be addressed for a proper calibration of the test : ( i ) the choice of an adequate resampling mechanism that calibrates well the statistic distribution under the null hypothesis ; ( ii ) the computation of the test statistic , avoiding the integration in multidimensional cylinders ; ( iii ) the selection of a suitable pair of estimation bandwidths .",

    "then , an important advantage of ( [ test_simple ] ) is that computing requirements are similar for different dimensions @xmath12 , something which is not the case if ( [ test ] ) is employed with numerical integration .",
    "as noted in the previous section , in order to apply the test procedure in practice , calibration algorithms must be introduced . in this setting , two main issues must be considered : on the one hand , the null hypothesis of independence is stated in a nonparametric way , which will determine the resampling methods used for calibration ; on the other hand , the test statistic @xmath72 involves a pair of bandwidths , which must be properly chosen . along this section , a bootstrap calibration algorithm and a permutation method for @xmath72 will be discussed .",
    "bootstrap calibration is not at all foreign to hypothesis testing , specially if the null hypothesis is nonparametric and the test statistic is based on smoothed estimators , such as those ones built with kernels . in this setting , two problems must be faced : ( i ) the design of a resampling mechanism ( from the null hypothesis ) and ( ii ) the selection of a pair of bandwidths for computing the test statistic . as it will be seen later , two pair of bandwidths will be needed : the first one , called _ pilot bandwidths _ ( denoted by @xmath87 ) , will be used for resampling , and as a basis for obtaining the joint estimation bandwidths @xmath88 by bootstrap .",

    "only fire perimeters mapped in the latter period were considered , which results in @xmath210 fire perimeters . +",
    "this application is based on the watershed delineation proposed by @xcite . in their work , watersheds were derived from the shuttle radar topography mission ( srtm ) digital terrain model @xcite using the arcgis hydrology toolbox @xcite .",
    "minimum watershed size was interactively increased so that each watershed contained a minimum of 25 fire observations ( see the cited work for more details ) .",
    "fire perimeters straddling watershed boundaries were allocated to the watershed that contains its centroid .",
    "+ the orientation of fire perimeters and watersheds is determined by principal component analysis , following the approach proposed by @xcite .",
    "specifically , principal component analysis is performed on the points that constitute the object s boundary ( fire or watershed ) , with orientation given by the first principal component ( pc1 ) .",
    "boundary points can be represented either in bidimensional space defined by each vertex s latitude and longitude coordinates , or in tridimensional space , taking also into account the altitude .",
    "then , the pc1 corresponds to an axis that passes through the center of mass of the object and maximizes the variance of the projected vertices , represented in @xmath211 or in @xmath212 .",
    "the fact of computing the pc1 also in @xmath212 aims for taking into account the variability of fires according to their slope , which , as the center plot of figure [ fig3 ] shows , present marked differences between regions .",
    "then , the orientation of the object is taken as the direction given by its pc1 .",
    "+ it is important to notice that an orientation is not a directional observation , and that some conversion is needed for applying the directional  linear independence test . in the two  dimensional case ,",
    "the orientation is an axial object ( the orientation n / s is also s / n ) .",
    "these orientations can be encoded by an angular variable @xmath213 , with period @xmath214 , so @xmath215 is a circular variable .",
    "then , with this codification , the angles @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath214 , @xmath218 represent the e / w , ne / sw , n / s and nw / se orientations , respectively . in the three  dimensional space , the orientation is coded by a pair of angles @xmath219 using spherical coordinates , where @xmath213 plays the same role as the previous setting and @xmath220 $ ] measures the inclination ( @xmath221 for flat slope and @xmath222 for vertical ; only positive angles are considered as the slope of a certain angle @xmath223 equals the slope of @xmath224 ) .",
    "therefore , points with spherical coordinates @xmath225 , which lie on the upper semisphere , can be considered as a realization of a spherical variable .",
    "the null hypothesis of independence between wildfire orientation and its burnt area ( in log scale ) is rejected , either using orientations in @xmath211 or in @xmath212 , with a common @xmath138value @xmath226 .",
    "the test is carried out using the bandwidth selector @xmath143 ( considered from now on ) and all the @xmath210 observations for years 19852005 , ignoring stratification by watershed , and with @xmath187 permutations .",
    "the @xmath138values for the null hypothesis of independence between the orientation of a watershed and the total burnt area of fires within the region are @xmath227 and @xmath226 for orientations in @xmath211 and in @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the null hypothesis is also rejected at a significance level @xmath203 .",
    "+ after assessing the presence of dependence between wildfire orientation and size , it is possible to carry out a watershed  based spatial analysis by applying the test to each watershed , in order to detect if the presence of dependence is homogeneous , or if it is only related with some particular areas .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] represents maps of @xmath138values of the test applied to the observations of each watershed , using pc1 in @xmath211 and in @xmath212 ( left plot and right plot of figure [ fig4 ] , respectively ) .",
    "the maps reveal the presence of @xmath228 and @xmath229 watersheds where the null hypothesis of independence is rejected with significance level @xmath203 , for the circular  linear and the spherical  linear cases , respectively .",
    "this shows that the presence of dependence between fire orientation and size is not homogeneous and it is located in specific watersheds ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the inclusion of the altitude coordinate in the calculus of the pc1 leads to a richer detection of dependence between the wildfire orientation and size at the watershed level .",
    "this is due to the negative relation between the fire slope and size ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) , as large fires tend to have a flatter pc1 in @xmath212 because they occur over highly variable terrain .",
    "the resulting @xmath138values from the watershed analysis can also be combined using the false discovery rate procedure @xcite to test for independence between the wildfire orientation and the log  burnt area .",

    "a nonparametric test for assessing independence between a directional and a linear component has been proposed , and its finite sample performance has been illustrated through a simulation study .",
    "simulation results support a quite satisfactory behavior of the permutation test implemented with @xmath40 and @xmath143 bandwidths , outperforming for most of the cases the available circular  linear testing proposals , and being competitive in other cases .",
    "the proposed @xmath143 bandwidths presents better results in terms of empirical size , although further study is required in bandwidth selection .",
    "+ the immediate application of the test to the entire wildfire orientation and size dataset makes possible the detection of dependence between these two variables , for both two  dimensional or three  dimensional orientation .",
    "the same conclusion holds for watershed orientation and total area burnt .",
    "a detailed study of each watershed allows for a more specific insight into the problem .",
    "the evidence of independence between fire size and fire orientation in some watersheds , suggests that an event  based analysis ( such as the work of @xcite ) should yield results similar to those that would be expected from an area  based analysis . on the other hand , detection of dependence between fire size and orientation in watersheds with",
    "uniform orientation @xcite highlights cases where there may be a mixture of orientations . in such cases ,",
    "an analysis taking fire size into account might find evidence of preferential orientation in fire perimeters . in watersheds where fire events show preferential orientation ( non  uniform distribution ) and there is dependence between size and orientation ,",
    "fire orientation distributions are structured in relation to fire size , especially considering the typically asymmetric nature of fire size distributions , dominated by a small number of very large events @xcite . in these cases , an area  weighted analysis of fire perimeter orientation might lead different results than those found by @xcite . when altitude is included in calculus of the pc1 in @xmath212 , it highlights the negative relation between fire slope and size , which is mostly due to the fact that larger fires present flatter pc1 .",
    "slope has a skewed distribution , with low mean value and a relatively long right tale .",
    "thus , while small fires may be entirely located in high slopes , it is unlikely for large fires to occur over consistently steep areas . + from a technical perspective",
