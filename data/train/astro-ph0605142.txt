    "observations of disk galaxies reveal that arm substructures are prevalent in grand design spirals .",
    "some of the most prominent secondary features are spurs and feathers , which are structures that emanate from the primary spiral arm and are usually seen to sweep back to trail the flow in the interarm region .",
    "historically , in the observational literature the term `` spur '' has denoted stellar features seen in optical emission ( elmegreen 1980 ) , whereas the term `` feathering '' has been used to denote a series of extinction features that overlies the bright portion of a stellar spiral arm ( lynds 1970 ) .",
    "elmegreen ( 1980 ) concluded that spurs are long - lived features , based on observations in multiple bands , including the i band , which generally traces the older stellar component .",
    "recent high - resolution observations , such as the hubble heritage image of m51 ( scoville & rector 2001 ) and several galaxies in the spitzer sings sample ( kennicutt et al .  2003 ) , have revealed examples of these features in extraordinary detail .",
    "an archival study of hst images has established that spurs and feathers are in fact ubiquitous in galaxies with well - defined spiral arms and that single continuous structures evidence evolution from primarily gaseous to primarily stellar composition ( la vigne et al .",
    "2006 ) . taken together ,",
    "these observations indicate that feathers and spurs are an essential aspect of spiral structure that should be accounted for by theoretical modeling of disk galaxies .",
    "many studies of spiral structure , both theoretical and observational , have applied the hypothesis of a quasi stationary spiral structure ( qsss ) ( lin & shu 1964 ) . under the qsss framework , the general shape of the spiral pattern",
    "is assumed to remain steady for many galactic revolutions .",
    "the stellar spiral arms themselves arise as self - consistent density waves ( or modes ) .",
    "roberts ( 1969 ) demonstrated that shocks can develop in the gaseous component as it responds to an `` external '' spiral potential arising from the stellar disk , and predicted values of the gas velocity both upstream and downstream from the shocks .",
    "such velocity profiles have been observed for many galaxies , such as m51 ( e.g. rand 1993 , aalto et al .  1999 ,",
    "shetty et al .  2006 ) , and m100 ( e.g. rand 1995 ) .",
    "m81 has also been studied extensively in support of density wave theory ( e.g. visser 1980 and lowe et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "a number of theories consistent with the qsss concept have been proposed to explain substructure in spiral galaxies .",
    "shu , milione , & roberts ( 1973 ) suggest that ultra - harmonic resonances between the motion of the primary spiral pattern and the background gas flow can be responsible for the secondary features in spiral galaxies .",
    "chakrabarti , laughlin , & shu ( 2003 , hereafter cls ) performed hydrodynamic simulations of self - gravitating gaseous disks to study the role of ultraharmonic resonances .",
    "they showed that the spiral arm bifurcates and strong branches , which in observations are large scale dust lanes that are similar in angular extent to the main arms , occur near resonant radii ( see also artymowicz & lubow 1992 ) .",
    "the origin and nature of observed smaller - scale feathers and spurs , however , has not yet been firmly established .",
    "balbus ( 1988 ) attributed these features to growth of gravitational instabilities in the gas component in preferred directions .",
    "kim & ostriker ( 2002 ) , hereafter ko , performed numerical simulations focused on a local patch of a gaseous spiral arm in a galactic disk , and showed that the growth of prominent , nonlinear spurs can occur due to the mutual contributions of self - gravity and magnetic fields , via the so - called `` magneto - jeans instability . '' within the arm , the radial gradient in angular velocity is reversed , so that spurs in the models of ko are initially locally leading .",
    "well into the interarm regions , background galactic shear causes the spurs to become trailing features .",
    "this characteristic shape is evident in the hubble heritage image of m51 ( scoville & rector 2001 ) . on the other hand , wada & koda ( 2004 ) ,",
    "hereafter wk , suggest that the growth of spurs results from purely hydrodynamic effects . in their two - dimensional models ( excluding magnetic fields and self - gravity ) , the spiral shocks become unstable ; this instability causes the growth of clumps and subsequently leading interarm features , which they refer to as spurs .",
    "they suggest the mechanism responsible for the growth of these spurs is the kelvin - helmholtz instability . using sph simulations ,",
    "dobbs & bonnell ( 2006 ) also investigate the non - self - gravitating case , and suggest that feather and spur formation requires gas temperatures @xmath4 1000k .",
    "contemporary with the current work , kim & ostriker ( 2006 ) extended their 2d local self - gravitating models to 3d ; that work also investigates the effects of vertical structure on hydrodynamic kelvin - helmholtz modes .    here , we model isothermal gaseous disks under the influence of both magnetic and self - gravitational effects .",
    "we extend the local simulations of ko into the global regime , which allows us to study the growth of spurs using more realistic models .",
    "in particular , whereas in ko the unperturbed disk had uniform density , a linear shear profile , and did not treat curvature effects , the present models relax all of these idealizations .",
    "our global models , which extend over more than an order of magnitude in radius , allow arbitrary density profiles and rotation curves , and solve the full equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) in cylindrical symmetry . to assess the effect of self - gravity ,",
    "we first consider just a disk of rotating gas , varying initial conditions such as the magnetic field strength and toomre stability parameter .",
    "we then apply an external spiral potential , which reorganizes the gas to form a spiral pattern . in models with and without a spiral potential",
    ", we follow the evolution of the gas far into the nonlinear domain as self - gravity takes hold , investigating the properties of the interarm features and clumps that arise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath5[method ] we present the relevant equations of mhd and gravity , and describe the models , parameters , and numerical algorithms we use to simulate disk galaxies with spiral arms . in the following section ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "we consider models without including self - gravity , both with and without magnetic fields .",
    "next , in @xmath5[sgsec ] , we present the models including self - gravity .",
    "we show how self - gravity causes the growth of condensations in the gas , and how this effect is crucial for the growth of interarm structures in disks with an external spiral potential . in @xmath5[disc ] we analyze and discuss various aspects of our results , including : in @xmath5[asp ] , we explore the issue of distinguishing whether observed interarm structures are true arm spurs or independent background features with a superposed large - scale spiral structure ; in @xmath5[clumps ] we quantify masses and spacings of clumps and spurs ; and in @xmath5[gccomp ] and @xmath5[qeff ] we discuss the issue of gas / star arm offsets and disk thickness , respectively .",
    "we conclude in @xmath5[summ ] with a summary .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we give a detailed description of our algorithms to compute self - gravity , as well as tests comparing the results of different numerical approaches .",
    "our simulations involve the gaseous response to an external spiral potential , including effects of self - gravity and magnetic fields , in a two - dimensional galactic disk model .",
    "the gas is initially in pure circular motion around the galactic center .",
    "we adopt a flat rotation curve , i.e.  a constant azimuthal velocity @xmath6 .",
    "a non - axisymmetric variation in the stellar component is responsible for an external spiral perturbation , and is modeled as a rigidly rotating potential with a pattern speed @xmath7 .",
    "we investigate the formation and evolution of arms , spurs , clumps , and other features by integrating the mhd equations in a polar @xmath8 coordinate system .",
    "the relevant equations of mhd and gas self - gravity are @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the gas surface density , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the vertically averaged velocity , vertically integrated pressure , and vertically averaged magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the semi - thickness of the disk is @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 is the mid - plane density @xmath19 . for our models",
    ", we assume an isothermal equation of state , so that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the sound speed .",
    "the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , represent the external spiral potential and the gaseous self - gravitational potential .",
    "the external spiral potential @xmath22 is specified at time @xmath24 , in the inertial frame , by @xmath25 \\label{spiralpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath7 are the number of arms , reference phase angle , and spiral pattern speed , respectively .",
    "we assume the spiral arms have a constant pitch angle @xmath28 , implying a logarithmic spiral , so that @xmath29 since we simulate disks in an inertial frame of reference , explicit corrections to equation ( [ force ] ) for coriolis and centrifugal forces are not required .      for the simulations presented in this paper",
    ", we use a constant sound speed @xmath21 , which we set to 7 km s@xmath30   for scaling our solutions .",
    "we use a constant rotational velocity @xmath6 , which is set to 210 km s@xmath30 . because our models are isothermal ,",
    "in fact our results would hold for any model with the same ratio @xmath31 = 30 .",
    "the code length unit is @xmath32 , which for convenient scaling of our solutions we set to 1 kpc .",
    "with @xmath21 = 7 km s@xmath30 , this implies a time unit for scaling of @xmath33 years .",
    "this time corresponds to one orbit @xmath34 at a fiducial radius @xmath35 which is given by @xmath36 .",
    "with @xmath32 = 1 kpc , the value of @xmath35 is 4.77 kpc .",
    "our results can be rescaled to other values of @xmath35 and @xmath32 with the same ratio .",
    "we explore a range of values for the parameters required to specify the spiral perturbation .",
    "the amplitude of the potential perturbation @xmath37 in equation ( [ spiralpot ] ) is characterized by the ratio @xmath38 of the maximum radial perturbation force to the radial force from the background axisymmetric potential ( responsible for @xmath6 ) , i.e. @xmath39 we model spiral disks with external potential strengths @xmath38 = 10% , 3% , and 1% .",
    "we apply the spiral perturbation gradually , increasing from zero and settling to the maximum level @xmath38 at time @xmath40 .",
    "since it has proved to be difficult to locate corotation from observations , we also explore a range in @xmath41 = 0.19 to 0.96 . for our fiducial values of @xmath32 and @xmath21",
    ", @xmath7 ranges from @xmath28 to 42 km s@xmath30@xmath42kpc@xmath30 , corresponding to corotation radii of 25 to 5 kpc for a circular velocity of 210 km s@xmath30 .",
    "the pitch angle @xmath28 in most of our simulations is @xmath43 .",
    "we will show that changing the pitch angle does not strongly affect the formation and properties of substructures . for all our models",
    ", we have an @xmath26 = 2 ( two - armed ) pattern .",
    "the initial surface density @xmath44 at the fiducial radius @xmath35 , along with the constant circular velocity @xmath6 , determines the value of the toomre stability parameter at @xmath35 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the initial epicyclic frequency ; for a constant circular velocity , @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the initial background surface density at @xmath35 is @xmath48 as described below , we explore a couple of initial density distributions , including a @xmath49 density distribution for which @xmath0 is initially constant for the whole disk .",
    "we characterize the initial magnetic field strength by the ratio @xmath50 of the midplane gas pressure to the midplane magnetic field pressure @xmath51 the initial magnetic field lines @xmath52 lie in the plane of the disk , and are directed in the @xmath53 direction only . from equation ( [ beta ] )",
    "the value of the magnetic field ( with @xmath21 , @xmath50 , and @xmath17 constant ) varies @xmath54 .",
    "taking @xmath17 = 100 pc and @xmath55 = 2 , the value of @xmath56 at the fiducial radius is @xmath57      we follow the evolution of the gaseous disk by integrating equations ( [ cont ] ) - ( [ poisson ] ) using a cylindrical polar version of the zeus code .",
    "zeus ( stone & norman , 1992a , 1992b ) is a time - explicit , operator - split , finite difference method for solving the equations of mhd on a staggered mesh .",
    "zeus employs  constrained transport \" to ensure that @xmath58 , and the  method of characteristics \" for accurate propagation of alfvnic disturbances .",
    "the hydrodynamic / mhd portion of our cylindrical - polar code has been verified using a standard suite of test problems .",
    "these include advection tests , shocks aligned and not aligned with the coordinates , a magnetized rotating wind ( stone & norman 1992b ) , and a rotating equilibrium disk with both magnetic and pressure gradients .",
    "the @xmath8 staggered mesh for our version of the code has a constant logarithmic increment in the radial dimension , i.e.  @xmath59 , for some @xmath60 .",
    "we consider only the perturbed gas density ( by subtracting off the initial density ) in determining the self - gravitational potential at each timestep .",
    "the contribution of the initial axisymmetric gas disk to the total potential is assumed to be included in the axisymmetric potential responsible for the constant circular velocity @xmath6 . to compute the self - gravitational potential @xmath23 , we use one of two methods described in the appendix .",
    "one method uses a combination of a fourier transform in the azimuthal direction and a green s function in the radial direction , while the other method uses fourier transforms in both directions on an expanded , zero - padded grid . for both methods ,",
    "we allow for finite disk thickness using a softening parameter @xmath17 . except",
    "as noted , we adopt @xmath17 = 100 pc .",
    "we give detailed descriptions of our methods , tests , and comparisons in the appendix .",
    "fast fourier transforms are performed using the free software fftw ( frigo & johnson 2005 ) .",
    "the standard computational domain for our models has 512 radial and 1024 azimuthal zones , covering a radius range of 1 - 15 kpc , and an azimuthal range of 0 - @xmath61 radians . with this resolution ,",
    "the jeans length ( @xmath62 ) from our initial surface density distributions are well resolved at all radii , satisfying the truelove criterion ( truelove et al .",
    "the radial range allows @xmath63 5 radial wavelengths of the spiral pattern .",
    "given the extended range in the radial dimension , we implement outflow boundary conditions , since loss of gas at the boundary will not affect the majority of the disk .",
    "we also taper the spiral potential near the boundaries , which helps minimize loss of matter near the edges . in the azimuthal direction ,",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "though the azimuthal range is only half of a complete disk , the gravitational potential includes the contribution from the other half that is not explicitly simulated ( see appendix ) .",
    "we first investigate the flow of gas in a spiral potential without including the gaseous self - gravitational potential .",
    "these preliminary simulations will indicate whether , for a given parameter set and numerical resolution , long lasting spiral patterns can be sustained .",
    "we will also investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the resulting flow and spiral morphology . as these models are similar to the hydrodynamic simulations of wk , we are able to investigate the `` wiggle instability '' that they propose , and to assess how magnetic fields affect this process .",
    "table [ models ] shows the relevant parameters used for each model .",
    "column ( 1 ) labels each model . column",
    "( 2 ) lists @xmath50 , which characterizes the magnetic field strength ( see eq . [ [ beta ] ] ) . the external potential strength @xmath38 ( from eq . [ [ eps ] ] ) is listed in column ( 3 ) .",

    "the pitch angle @xmath28 is listed in column ( 5 ) .",
    "we note that though the computational domain only simulates half the disk , with periodic azimuthal boundary conditions , we replicate the simulated half in presenting snapshots of the models .",
    "we begin by considering simple cases where the rotating gas in a disk only responds to an external spiral potential , without including magnetic fields or gas self - gravity .",
    "model hd1 has a weak ( @xmath38 = 3% ) and slowly rotating external spiral potential , as well as a small pitch angle ( 10 ) .",
    "figure [ hd1pl ] shows density snapshots of model hd1 . at @xmath64 = 1 , when the external potential reaches its maximum amplitude , the spiral arms are weak but distinct .",
    "figures [ hd1pl](b ) and [ hd1pl](c ) shows that 2 orbits after the potential is fully applied , the spiral arms are still distinct and rather regular . at @xmath64 = 3 , in the inner regions , shown in figure [ hd1pl](d ) , the spiral arms are not as distinct as the rest of the galaxy .",
    "the main arms grow weaker , and leading spiral like features grow between the main ( trailing ) arms .",
    "nevertheless , a global spiral pattern persists throughout the galaxy , indicating that a weak perturbing potential can sustain a global , long lasting , spiral pattern .",
    "figure [ hd2pl ] shows density snapshots of model hd2 , with the same scale shown in figure [ hd1pl ] for model hd1 . as expected , since @xmath38",
    "is increased to 10 % , the spiral arms are much stronger .",
    "the global pattern persists for many orbits , but the arms are clearly more dynamic . as early as 1 orbit after the potential is fully applied ( at @xmath65 ) , the spiral arms at @xmath27.5 kpc , indicated by the arrow in figure [ hd2pl](b ) , bifurcates .",
    "this region is near the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "the bifurcation causes the arm at @xmath27 kpc to lose matter , and it thus becomes weaker than the arms located farther inward .",
    "further , the arm at @xmath29.3 kpc has a much different pitch angle from the arms at different locations .",
    "after an additional orbit , the bifurcated part of the inner arm has moved radially outward and connected with the outer arms . in the meantime , the arms that lost matter during bifurcation regain strength and attain similar surface density to the arms in the inner regions .",
    "figure [ hd2pl](d ) shows the central regions of model hd2 at @xmath64 = 3 . here , unlike in the case with a weaker potential ( fig .",
    "[ hd1pl](d ) ) , the arms remain continuous and distinct . however , there are also prominent interarm filamentary features , some even connecting two adjacent arm segments .",
    "such features can be seen to develop as early as @xmath64 = 2 , in figure [ hd2pl](b ) .",
    "wk found similar features , which they identified as spurs / fins , in their hydrodynamic models ( the detailed morphology differs because they use a different rotation curve ) .",
    "they attribute the formation of their spurs / fins to the kelvin - helmholtz instability . in our models",
    ", these features only grow in the innermost regions ; we shall show in the following section that magnetic fields prevent their formation .",
    "we shall further show that it is the combination of magnetic fields _ and _ self - gravity that results in spurs forming everywhere in a disk , not just in the innermost regions .",
    "another difference between models hd1 and hd2 is the relative location of the gas density peaks of the arms .",
    "the gaseous arms in model hd1 ( @xmath38 = 3% ) form farther downstream than in model hd2 ( @xmath38 = 10% ) .",
    "we discuss the offset between the dust lanes and the spiral potential minimum in @xmath5[summ ] , as well as compare with the results from the recent study by gittins and clarke ( 2004 ) .    changing the pattern speed of the spiral potential does not dramatically alter the resulting spiral structure .",
    "figure [ hd3_4pl](a ) shows a snapshot of model hd3 , one orbit after the external spiral potential with @xmath66 is fully applied . here , the corotation radius is at 5 kpc , instead of 25 kpc .",
    "the spiral structure is similar to that shown in figure [ hd2pl](b ) , but the arms are not as dynamic , and the bifurcation region is shifted inward , as expected if this phenomenon is indeed due to a resonance . for all our models the shock locus transitions from the concave to the convex side of the gaseous arm at or near corotation . inside this radius ,",
    "the shock front is located on the concave side of the gaseous spiral arm . farther out in the disk ,",
    "the shock front moves to the outer , convex side of the arm .",
    "figure [ profrel ] shows the density and velocity profiles relative to the external spiral potential in two regions inside and outside corotation for model hd3 .",
    "for both regions , the gas peaks occur downstream from the minimum of @xmath22 . inside corotation ,",
    "the gas shocks after the gas passes through the spiral potential .",
    "outside corotation , the spiral pattern passes through the gas , leaving the shocked gas behind .",
    "the shock front itself is always upstream from the density peak .",
    "thus , inside corotation the shock occurs on the inside face of the spiral arm , while outside corotation the shock forms on the outer face of the arm .",
    "the density and velocity profiles in figure [ profrel ] are quite similar to those obtained using local models ( e.g. figs . 2 , 3 of ko ) .",
    "we note that in regions closer to corotation , the gas peaks lie near the minimum in @xmath22 , and shocks can not be clearly distinguished .",
    "the secondary density hump in the profile inside corotation occurs near the 4:1 ultraharmonic resonance , where @xmath67 ( if pressure effects are ignored ) .",
    "cls also identified similar secondary features in their global hydrodynamic models , which they denote as `` branches . ''",
    "they also find such branches near locations of the 6:1 ultraharmonic resonance .",
    "qualitatively , the formation and subsequent evolution of the branch features in our models are similar to those shown in cls .",
    "models with a larger pitch angle show some differences from those with more tightly wrapped arms .",
    "figure [ hd3_4pl](b ) is a snapshot of model hd4 , again 1 orbit after the full spiral potential is applied .",
    "similar to the results of wk , this model shows that loosely wound spiral arms are much more unstable than tightly wound arms , because the shock is stronger .",
    "the bifurcation is clearly evident , and results in replenishment of the depleted arms in the outer regions after an additional orbit .",
    "the interarm sheared filamentary features in the inner region of the galaxy are more pronounced than in the corresponding model with @xmath28=10@xmath68 , shown in figure [ hd2pl](b ) .      before including self - gravity , we test the effect of magnetic fields on non - self - gravitating disks with a spiral potential .",
    "figure [ mhdcomp ] compares snapshots at @xmath69 , of a model without magnetic fields , hd2 , to one with magnetic fields , mhd1 .",
    "clearly , the interarm features described in the previous section no longer appear in the magnetized case .",
    "thus , equipartition - strength magnetic fields are able to suppress the `` wiggle instability '' identified by wk in large @xmath38 simulations ( for small enough @xmath38 , as seen in model hd1 , there is stability even in unmagnetized models ) .",
    "to include self - gravity in our simulations , we must introduce an additional parameter , which we choose to be the toomre parameter @xmath55 evaluated at @xmath35 , given in equation ( [ q ] ) .",
    "table [ sgmodels ] shows the input parameters for models including self - gravity .",
    "the first five columns are the same as those in table [ models ] , and column ( 6 ) gives the value of @xmath55 .",
    "as shown in equation ( [ q ] ) , @xmath70 .      for disks with constant circular velocities , the epicyclic frequency @xmath71",
    "; thus if the initial density distribution @xmath49 , @xmath0 will be constant for the whole disk .",
    "we first consider models in which the initial surface density profiles are indeed inversely proportional to the galactocentric radius .",
    "such a distribution is consistent with many surface density profiles shown in regan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and wong & blitz ( 2002 ) .    to test the inherent stability of disks with constant @xmath0",
    ", we consider cases with self - gravity , but with no external potential , models shdne1 , shdne2 , and smhdne , shown in figure [ nosp ] .",
    "since the initial density has random white - noise 0.1% perturbations , the over - dense regions can grow due to self - gravity .",
    "as these regions grow , they also become stretched azimuthally due to the background shear .",
    "the runaway growth of the over - dense regions eventually causes neighboring regions to have extremely large velocities , such that the courant condition would require an extremely small timestep ; we therefore halt the simulation .",
    "model shdne1 has @xmath55=1 , and becomes unstable very rapidly ( within one orbit at @xmath35 ) , as shown in figure [ nosp](a ) .",
    "figure [ nosp](b ) shows model shdne2 , with @xmath55 = 2 , at the same time as the @xmath55 = 1 model in figure [ nosp](a ) .",
    "since the @xmath55 = 2 model is more stable , enough time has not yet elapsed for the over - dense regions to dominate .",
    "the addition of magnetic fields , as shown in figure [ nosp](c ) from model smhdne with @xmath55 = 1 , does not affect the growth of filaments significantly .",
    "the subtle difference is that the magnetic fields slightly slow the growth of over - dense regions . as a result ,",
    "models including magnetic fields evolve longer before the flow velocities in some zones becomes extreme .",
    "figure [ nosp](d ) is the last snapshot of model shdne2 at @xmath64 = 1.5 orbits . here ,",
    "the outer regions have evolved to the point that the structure is similar to that in figure [ nosp](a ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the radius of the stable inner region in the @xmath55 = 2 model is larger than that of the @xmath55 = 1 model ( shdne1 ) . as expected , increasing the value of @xmath55 increases the area of stability in the inner regions , and requires more time for the instability in the outer regions to grow .",
    "the stability tests show that filament - like structures will grow in a shearing disk with sufficient gas surface density , regardless of the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the toomre stability parameter governs which regions are prone to gravitational instabilities .",
    "as @xmath55 increases , the outer disk becomes more stable , and more time is required for growth of instabilities . in the models",
    "presented thus far , we have considered disks for which the initial surface densities vary as @xmath72 , so that @xmath0 is initially constant everywhere in the disk .",
    "the reason that the outer disk becomes unstable even when the inner disk does not is that the disk thickness @xmath17 is constant throughout the disk .",
    "the finite thickness stabilizes the inner disk more than the outer disk , because the ratios of @xmath73 and @xmath74 vary as @xmath72 for constant @xmath0 models , where the toomre wavelength @xmath75 and the jeans wavelength @xmath76 .",
    "we discuss this effect in @xmath5[qeff ] .",
    "the models we have presented so far have an initial surface density distribution proportional to @xmath72 , yielding a constant value of the toomre parameter with @xmath78 .",
    "however , the surface density distributions shown by wong & blitz ( 2002 ) are in many cases approximately consistent with a surface density distribution proportional to @xmath79 . further , in the observational analysis of martin & kennicutt ( 2001 )",
    ", @xmath0 varies with radius for many galaxies .",
    "a variety of radial distributions are evident , some close to @xmath72 and others to @xmath79 .",
    "we thus consider models similar to those presented thus far , but with initial @xmath80 surface density distributions , such that @xmath77 .",
    "the labels of such models will follow the convention of those already presented , but with the addition of a prime ( @xmath81 ) sign .",
    "figure [ qvartest ] shows snapshots of disk models without an external potential , shdne1@xmath82 and shdne2@xmath82 , at @xmath83 . for shdne1@xmath82 ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 ranges from 0.21 at the inner boundary to 3.15 at the outer boundary .",
    "the respective values are twice as large in model shdne2@xmath82 . when compared with figure [ nosp ] , it is clear that these models are much more stable .",
    "only the innermost region in shdne1@xmath82 shows more instability than shdne1 , the corresponding disk with @xmath13 initially @xmath84 ( fig . [ nosp](a ) ) .",
    "as expected , since @xmath0 increases with @xmath78 , the outer regions of the disk are more stable , and thus less susceptible to gravitational instabilities .",
    "in fact , there has been very little growth of perturbations in model shdne2@xmath82 ( @xmath55 = 2 ) at 1 orbit ( fig . [ qvartest](b ) ) .",

    "in addition to these models , we have performed additional simulations with a wide range of values and combinations of the chosen parameters , with similar characteristic results . for our fiducial model , @xmath85 , @xmath7 = 8.4 ( corresponding to a corotation radius of 25 kpc , which is outside the edge of the disk ) , @xmath28 = 10 , and @xmath55 = 2 .",

    "the most striking aspect of the snapshots , besides the spiral arms , are the interarm features .",
    "these features differ significantly between the two models , with differences enhanced at the later times .",
    "this is shown for the central region in detail in figure [ smhd1_2inpl ] . with a weak external potential ( smhd1 ) ,",
    "the interarm features are strong as far inwards as 7 kpc . however , with the strong external potential ( smhd2 ) , the interarm features are strong in the outer regions , but at radii of @xmath25 - 11 kpc they are weak . in the inner regions , at @xmath78 @xmath86 5 kpc , the interarm features are again much stronger than the background ; there are no strong interarm features in the innermost region of smhd1 .",
    "the reason for this difference in interarm features is clear in the structure of the arms themselves . in the @xmath38 = 3% model ,",
    "the arms inside 7 kpc are smooth . in the @xmath38 = 10% models ,",
    "on the other hand , the arms are broken into many clumps .",
    "the strong external potential in model smhd2 has gathered more matter into the spiral arms , and self - gravity causes concentrations to grow , with much of the gas eventually collapsing into clumps .",
    "gas flowing through the arms can be concentrated by these growing clumps , and returned to the interarm regions as overdense spurs . since the stronger spiral potential of model smhd2 concentrates more gas in the arms , the interarm regions at radii of @xmath25 - 11 kpc has less gas compared to model smhd1 with a weak spiral potential ;",
    "as a result the interarm features in this region are weaker in model smhd2 .",
    "the boxed region from figure [ smhd1_2inpl](b ) is shown in detail in figure [ slvec ] with the instantaneous velocities , including the unperturbed velocity field . far from the spiral arms ,",

    "gravitationally bound structures do not leave the gaseous spiral arm , but continue to build in mass as matter from the interarm regions flows into the arm .",
    "if kept unchecked , the arm clumps would grow in a runaway fashion .",
    "the overlaid contours in figure [ slvec ] indicate magnetic field lines .",
    "initially , the magnetic field is directed only in the azimuthal direction .",
    "as the spiral arms increase in density , the magnetic field is concentrated in the arms , thereby weakening the field in the interarms .",
    "the growth of the clumps along the arms further perturbs the field lines .",
    "however , only strong density enhancements produce field perturbations ; the interarm features emerging from the clumps and the background features that grow in models without an external spiral potential do not strongly affect the magnetic field .",

    "the arms still have the over - dense knots , but the stretched features near the arms project in the opposite direction from those in the fiducial model .",
    "this is as expected , because outside corotation , the rotating spiral potential has a greater angular velocity than the gas .",
    "the flow enters the arms from the outer ( convex ) side , and leaves from the inner ( concave ) side .",
    "azimuthally varying over / under dense regions that are created within the arm and return to the interarm region on the inside of the arm are sheared into trailing structures .",

    "[ smhd1_2pl](c ) and ( d ) ) , such as the knots of matter in the arm and the trailing features in the outermost and innermost regions , are also present .      for spiral models with initial surface density distributions @xmath90 , we only present cases with magnetic fields ( @xmath91 ) ; we have shown that magnetic fields act to keep the arms intact .",

    "these features grow in both @xmath88 and @xmath94 models , but are stronger in the @xmath94 case .",
    "it is also clear that the interarm features connect with the most dense clumps in the arms , which are more dense in model smhd2@xmath82 than smhd3@xmath82 .    even though the self - gravitational force is stronger in model smhd3@xmath82 ( @xmath88 ) than in model smhd2@xmath82 ( because the absolute @xmath13 is larger in smhd3@xmath82 ) , the clumps in the arms of model smhd2@xmath82 are more dense ( relative to @xmath44 ) .",
    "this results because more gas flows into the spiral arms in the more stable disk of model smhd2@xmath82 .",

    "[ smhd4_5](a ) ) . inside corotation ,",
    "the interarm features , which are connected with the arm clumps , occur exterior to the main spiral arms .",
    "however , outside corotation , the interarm sheared features emanate inwards from the main arms in the opposite sense from those inside corotation .",
    "this direction is downstream from the arms , as seen in a frame rotating at @xmath7 .",
    "near corotation , clumps in the arms exist , but do not extend much either interior or exterior to the arms .",
    "in our presentation and description of the models in @xmath5[sgsec ] , we have referred to the interarm structures we identify as features , not spurs .",
    "we will define spurs as interarm features that are distinctly associated with spiral arms , intersecting the main spiral arms at locations where self - gravity caused the growth of clumps . using this definition ,",
    "spurs in the present global models would therefore be analogies of the structures studied in the local models of ko .",
    "of course , it is well known that self - gravitating instabilities grow when the surface density is large enough , whether or not there is an external potential .",
    "the resulting over - dense entities , which grow via swing amplification , are stretched due to the shear in the disk .",
    "the interarm features arising in our models with spiral perturbations have similar shapes to those in the stability test models , since the interarm shear profile is similar to that of the unperturbed velocity field . at first glance , it is therefore not obvious whether the interarm features in the spiral models are specifically due to the spiral perturbation , or whether they would arise regardless of the presence of the spiral perturbation",
    ".    given , however , the dependence of the orientation of dense interarm features on the spiral pattern speed ( or the corotation radius ) as seen in figures [ smhd4_5](a ) and [ rsqrcr5 ] , it is clear the external potential can have a significant effect . depending on whether the spiral potential sweeps through the gas ( outside corotation ) , or whether the gas overtakes the spiral potential ( inside corotation ) , the interarm features in these cases grow inward or outward from the arm , respectively .",
    "this reversal of orientation indicates that the growth of such features is dependent on the spiral potential .",
    "these dense features , furthermore , are all connected to distinct arm clumps ; they therefore fit our definition of `` true spurs . ''",
    "on the other hand , the lower density interarm features evident in figures [ smhd1_2pl](b ) and [ smhd3](b ) are similar to the structures seen in figure [ nosp ] that grow in the absence of a spiral potential , provided the interarm surface density is sufficiently high .",
    "these `` background features '' are often _ not _ associated with arm clumps when they are present ; we therefore do not consider them `` true spurs . ''",
    "we can quantify the effect of the spiral potential on outer - disk features by computing the dimensionless wavenumber of the background features @xmath95 . here , @xmath96 is the local two - dimensional jeans length , and @xmath97 is the mean azimuthal separation of the background features .",
    "table [ wavenum ] shows the feature separation and the wavenumber for mhd models ( @xmath85 ) with the external potential strengths f = 0% , 1% , 3% , and 10% , for a region in the outer part of the disk .",
    "the other parameters are the same as the fiducial model : @xmath28 = 10 , @xmath7 = 8.4 km s@xmath30",
    "kpc@xmath30 , and @xmath55 = 2 ( with initial surface density distribution @xmath98 ) . for the feature separation @xmath97",
    ", we use the mean of the distances between the peaks of the interarm features at a radius of @xmath78 = 9.9 kpc , along an arc of 80 , at @xmath99 ( the feature separation does not vary much with time ) . at @xmath78 = 9.9 kpc , using the initial surface density we find @xmath100 kpc .",
    "the table shows that the feature separation does not vary much with the strength of the external potential , suggesting that these outer - disk features are not `` true spurs . '' in fact , the feature separation is always approximately the jeans length . for model smhd3 ( @xmath88 , @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the feature separation at the same radius is 1.2 kpc .",
    "the value of @xmath101 is half that of the @xmath94 model , while the feature spacing decreases by 30% .",
    "this gives a ratio @xmath102 that is @xmath63 30% smaller when @xmath103 than when @xmath104 , but is still close to unity .    from figure [ smhd1_2inpl ] , it is clear that a strong external potential is required for interarm features to grow in the inner regions . similarly , in @xmath77 models ( fig .",
    "[ rsq ] ) , stretched interarm features only grow near the arms in models with a strong external potential . in models having @xmath77 without an externally imposed spiral potential ( fig .",
    "[ qvartest](b ) ) , sheared trailing features do not grow in the inner regions .",
    "further , the features that do grow in models with strong spiral potentials are connected to the clumps that form in the spiral arm itself .",
    "thus , we identify the interarm features in the inner regions as true arm spurs , and for measuring the separation we replace the symbol @xmath97 by @xmath105 . at @xmath106 4.5",
    "kpc , we measure values of @xmath107 0.6 kpc , and @xmath108 0.6 kpc using the initial surface density .",
    "we find that the spur separation is again approximately equal to the jeans length at ambient densities .",
    "if instead we had used the value of @xmath13 in the arm , @xmath101 would decrease , giving the ratio @xmath109 5 .",
    "pc and @xmath110 pc , so the jeans length using arm densities is resolved . ] for model smhd3 ( @xmath88 ) , both @xmath105 and the arm surface density ( therefore @xmath111 ) are comparable to those quantities in model smhd2 , though the initial background surface densities differ by a factor of two .",
    "thus , for @xmath103 the ratio @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . evidently , for `` true spurs '' the spacing depends more directly on @xmath111 than on @xmath114 . even though spurs will grow in the inner regions",
    "only if there is a strong spiral potential , the distance between the spurs is still within a factor of two of the minimum scale length required for gravitational instability under uniform conditions ; when @xmath104 the ratio @xmath115 is indistinguishable from the case of `` background features '' that grow in the outer regions independent of the spiral potential .",
    "for realistic @xmath0 values near 2 , the separation of filamentary structures is thus not sufficient in itself to determine their origin .",
    "the additional consideration of whether structures are connected to arm clumps or not discriminate between `` true spurs '' and swing - amplified `` background features . ''",
    "as discussed above , we term interarm features that grow out of arm condensations `` true spurs .",
    "'' when interarm features grow as background effects , strong condensations can also grow within and remain in the arm . in this case , however , there is not a one - to - one relationship between interarm features and arm condensations ( see e.g. the outer regions of fig .",
    "[ smhd1_2pl](d ) and fig .",
    "[ smhd3](a ) ) . in both situations , however , the arm condensations that grow are generally regularly spaced , similar to the `` beads on a string '' of bright hii regions often observed in spiral galaxies .",
    "the spacings between the clumps in the @xmath94 model ( smhd2 ) at @xmath116 kpc is typically @xmath2630 pc , comparable to 5@xmath111 ( measured using arm surface densities before fragmentation ) .",
    "in other models with distinct arm clumps , such as smhd3 ( @xmath88 ) , smhd4 ( @xmath117 kpc ) and smhd5 ( @xmath118 ) we measure clump spacings of @xmath23 - 5@xmath111 .",
    "we also measured the width @xmath119 of the spiral arms .",
    "for the fiducial model smhd2 ( @xmath94 and @xmath38 = 10% ) , the fwhm @xmath120 pc , for the same region of the arm for which the clump / spur spacing was measured .",
    "the ratio @xmath121 is consistent with the observational study of elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1983 ) and the theoretical analysis of elmegreen ( 1994 ) . for the @xmath88 model , smhd3 ,",
    "we measure an arm width @xmath122 pc , and clump / spur spacing of @xmath123 pc . thus , when @xmath88 the ratio @xmath124 is close to unity .",
    "the measured ratio @xmath125 is therefore more consistent between our differing @xmath0 models than the ratio @xmath124 , possibly due to magnetic fields and the physics of mji ( see ko ) . in practice , however , the observed range of @xmath0 might not be large enough to distinguish a difference .    for models shown in figure [ smhd1_2pl ] ( and [ smhd1_2inpl ] ) ,",

    "\\6 ) we find that without magnetic fields , the arms in self - gravitating models rapidly fragment , destroying the continuous , distinct spiral arm shape .",
    "thus , magnetic fields may be important for maintaining the integrity of grand design spiral structure in the ism , even as self - gravity ( and star formation ) work to destroy these large - scale patterns .",
    "\\7 ) the distribution and extent of interarm features that grow in self - gravitating models depend on the surface density distribution ( or , equivalently , the instability parameter @xmath0 ) . for @xmath72 surface density distributions ,",
    "for which @xmath0 is initially constant , strong feathering grows early on in the outer regions of the disk . at later times in the inner regions ,",

    "@xmath0 increases with radius . for these disks , spur formation in the outer regions is suppressed , but prominent spurs still grow in the inner regions .",
    "our models have adopted @xmath17 = constant ; if @xmath17 increases with @xmath78 , it is possible to have inner - disk instability and outer - disk stability even with @xmath0 = constant .",
    "\\8 ) the orientation of the spurs with respect to the arms depends on the pattern speed of the spiral potential .",
    "inside corotation , spurs extend outward from the convex side of the main dust lanes , as this is the downstream side of the arm .",
    "outside corotation , the potential rotates faster than the gas , so the spurs form inside the main dust lanes . in principle , a reversal in the orientation of spurs in observed galaxies could be used to determine the position of the corotation radius .    though we were able to produce spurs and quantify the conditions necessary for the growth of spurs with the models of this work , we were unable to follow the subsequent evolution of the disk for many orbits .",
    "runaway growth of the massive clumps in the spiral arms causes the surrounding gas to have large velocities , which implies short timesteps in order to satisfy the courant condition .",
    "in addition , the densities become sufficiently large and the clumps so small that they are not well resolved by our grid .",
    "however , the physicality of the simulation itself can be questioned at late times , because real condensations would not grow uninhibited .",
    "the agglomeration of gas in galaxies into gmcs eventually leads to the formation of stars . the photoionization and mechanical inputs from hii regions and supernovae associated with massive star formation in gmcs returns much of their gas to the diffuse phase . in future work",

    "we also plan to include heating and cooling processes to simulate a realistic multi - phase medium . by including processes of this kind",

    "kim , ostriker , & stone 2002 ) , such that equation ( [ 2d_cart ] ) becomes @xmath160 where @xmath17 is the thickness of the disk , and @xmath161 .",
    "obtaining the potential using fourier methods expressed in equations ( [ 3d_cart ] ) or ( [ 2d_cart ] ) assumes that the density is periodic .",
    "thus , the resulting potential includes a contribution from replicas of the density distribution ( outside the computational domain ) .",
    "if in fact one desires to compute the potential of a spatially isolated system with zero density outside of the computational domain , then this method is modified by computing fourier transforms on a larger , zero - padded array .",
    "the central portion of the larger array is filled with the density values from the original domain , and the surrounding zones are set to zero .",
    "for obtaining a solution of the poisson s equation the zero - padded array must be at least twice the size of the original array in each dimension ( e.g. hockney & eastwood 1981 ) .",
    "a larger padded region moves unphysical cusps away from the boundaries of the computational domain ; of course , increasing the size of the padded region requires more memory as well as cpu time .      in 2d cylindrical polar coordinates , a number of techniques have been explored to calculate the potential .",
    "miller ( 1978 ) describes a method which sums the potential due to concentric rings in polar coordinates .",
    "the potential at @xmath8 is written as @xmath162 where @xmath163 here , @xmath164 is a softening parameter .",
    "we can discretize equation ( [ miller_phi ] ) , writing the result as @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "the direct summation in equation ( [ miller_discrete ] ) is computationally expensive ; however , fourier transforms can accelerate the computation .",
    "the integral over @xmath167 in equation ( [ miller_phi ] ) is a convolution of @xmath168 with the mass distribution in the ring at @xmath169 with the equivalent for the sum in equation ( [ miller_discrete ] ) . by the fourier convolution theorem , we can write @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the 1d fourier transform in the azimuthal direction of the mass @xmath172 .",
    "the discrete fourier transform ( in the @xmath173 direction ) of the green s function @xmath174 only needs to be computed once , at the beginning of the simulation . for an @xmath8 computational grid , including periodic replicas of the density is required to cover the full @xmath175 domain of the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "the computational domain must therefore be @xmath176 for some @xmath26 ; we use @xmath177 for a two - armed spiral . aside from the effect of softening , this method of computing the potential is exact .    even though miller s ( 1978 ) method is more efficient than direct summation of equation ( [ miller_discrete ] ) , more memory and cpu time are still required than for a pure fourier approach . thus , for numerical expediency , we instead use a computationally more efficient method to obtain an approximate solution for @xmath23 . though this method is not an exact calculation of @xmath23",
    ", we will show that the differences between the exact ( miller ) method and our more efficient method is small . after describing our method",
    ", we will show how the results , as well as cpu usage , from the different methods compare .    to compute an approximate potential @xmath23 in polar",
    "coordinates based solely on fourier transforms , we make use of the method described in @xmath5[cartesian ]",
    ". we will hereafter refer to this method as the coordinate transformation method .",
    "if we apply a coordinate transformation @xmath178 poisson s equation becomes @xmath179 for in - plane gradients large compared to vertical gradients , the solution is @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "this has the same form as equation ( [ 2d_thick ] ) in the limit @xmath182 .",
    "more generally , solutions to the laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates have the form @xmath183 where the @xmath184 s are two independent bessel functions - e.g.  @xmath185 and @xmath186 - and where @xmath187 and azimuthal boundary conditions have been applied .",
    "the coefficients of each term in the sum is determined by the requirement that @xmath188 .",
    "each @xmath189 can then be written as a fourier - hankel transform of the surface density @xmath190 ( e.g. binney & tremaine , 1987 ) .",
    "since the force is dominated by terms with large gradients , the large @xmath191 values are most important . for large arguments ,",
    "the bessel functions approach sinusoidal functions , so that the @xmath189 s can be written as two - dimensional fourier transforms of @xmath192 . in this limit , we must have @xmath193 . altogether , we may therefore write our approximate solution as @xmath194 here , @xmath195 and @xmath196 is the wavenumber corresponding to the transformed radial coordinate . in order to have the @xmath197 values equally spaced ,",
    "the radial grid coordinates are equally separated in @xmath198 .    with this method ,",
    "the surface density is implicitly assumed periodic in both azimuth and radius .",
    "the spurious contribution from periodic replicas in the radial direction can be minimized by zero padding the edges of the density array in the radial direction , as described at the end of @xmath5[cartesian ] .      to compare the effects of the periodic replicas in the test cases for the coordinate transformation method , we use arrays that are 2@xmath199 , 4@xmath199 , 8@xmath199 , 16@xmath199 , and 32@xmath199 the size of the original density array .",
    "the computational domain for the comparison tests has 256 radial elements and 1024 azimuthal elements . as an example , for the case for which we use a 4@xmath199 larger array , the size of the @xmath192 array before taking a fourier transform to obtain @xmath200 is 1024 @xmath199 1024 .",
    "the actual values of the densities are stored in array elements where the first ( radial ) index is between 385 and 640 .",
    "all other elements of the array are set to zero .    to compare the two methods of computing the potential from test simulations , we arrange test cases for which the total mass in the computational domain is 0 or very small .",
    "the fourier method will include contributions from matter outside the computational domain , due to the assumed periodicity of the density .",
    "thus , minimizing the total mass will reduce this superfluous contribution . in analyzing the differences between the methods ,",
    "we keep in mind that the softening will affect the numerical values of the potential ( and force ) in regions with large density gradients . with the coordinate transformation method",
    ", we also compare the results from cases where the size of the zero padded zones vary .",
    "we inspect the potential of three test disks containing ( 1 ) a positive and negative ring , ( 2 ) a positive and negative radial spoke , and ( 3 ) and a positive and negative logarithmic spiral arm .",
    "we compare the region in between the positive and negative mass distributions regions , to avoid edge effects . for test cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we find the relative difference between the coordinate transformation and the miller method ( @xmath201 ) to be within @xmath23% . for test case ( 3 )",
    ", we measure a relative difference of @xmath25% .",
    "again , these relative differences are measured between the positive and negative density regions , away from the edges of the disk . for the self - gravitating simulations we perform , we are interested in the growth of substructures under similar circumstances , i.e.  away from the edges of the disk , near regions where the perturbed density is both positive and negative . nevertheless , even near the edges , all tests give values of the potential that agree within @xmath225% . finally , the difference between the tests using the coordinate transformation ( with varying sizes of the zero - padded zone ) is negligible .",
    "the main advantage of using the coordinate transformation method is the decrease in cpu time for each simulation . for this method computing the potential",
    "requires a multiplication of the density to obtain @xmath192 , a fourier transform to obtain @xmath200 , a multiplication in fourier space for the gravitational kernel in equation [ ft_trans ] , and an inverse fourier transform to obtain @xmath23 .",
    "this sequence requires fewer operations than the miller computational method .    to measure the efficiency of each method",
    ", we use a slightly different test simulation from the ones described above . in these tests , with a grid of 256 radial and 512 azimuthal zones , a spiral potential is turned on over the first half orbit , then the self - gravitational potential is slowly turned on over another half an orbit .",
    "thus , both potentials are turned on fully after 1 orbit .",
    "the test simulations are subsequently allowed to run for an additional orbit , after which the cpu times are compared .",
    "all these tests , as well as many of the simulations presented in this paper , were run on a machine with a 2.99 ghz pentium 4 processor , with 2 gb of ram .",
    "table [ cputab ] shows the cpu time ( relative to that using the exact solution ) required for each test to run .",
    "it is evident , as expected , that the simulations using the coordinate transformation method ( where we enlarge the density array by 2@xmath199 , 4@xmath199 , or 8@xmath199 ) requires much less cpu time than those using the exact potential computational method .",
    "since the numerical differences between the methods are modest , and to take advantage of the superior efficiency of the coordinate transformation method , we use the coordinate transformation method , enlarging the density array by 4@xmath199 , for our high resolution simulations presented in this paper .",
    "we have also tested models using the miller method , and obtain essentially the same results .",
