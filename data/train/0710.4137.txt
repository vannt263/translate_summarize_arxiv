    "damped ly - alpha absorbers ( dlas ) provide us with a high - resolution probe of galaxy formation processes up to redshift @xmath7 , allowing us to study the neutral hydrogen distribution and kinematics of young galaxies and their surroundings on scales from several pc to several kpc , although detailed information about the spatial extent of the absorbing gas can not be readily extracted from the observed velocity line profiles .",
    "dlas contain a large fraction of high - redshift baryons potentially available for star formation ( sf ; prochaska et al .",
    "2005 ) , however , their in - situ sf efficiency appears to be a factor of 20 - 30 lower than in the present - day galaxies of comparable gas surface density @xcite .",
    "even though dlas are presumably associated with fairly compact structures , they cover about a third of the sky , so there is a high probability that a line of sight to a remote quasar will contain such an absorber .",
    "currently , just over a 1000 such systems have been studied , and their number will undoubtedly increase in coming years.xavier/sdssdla/ ]    one of the unsolved long - standing puzzles in our understanding of dlas is their large neutral gas velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the median value of @xmath0 , the velocity interval encompassing 90% of the optical depth , in absorption lines of low ions associated with cold neutral gas ( such as siii , ni , feii , etc . ) is close to @xmath2 , and 10% of all systems have @xmath8 .",
    "observations indicate that there is virtually no correlation between the column density @xmath9 of the absorber and its absorption line velocity width , with even lower column density systems at the dla threshold @xmath10 demonstrating velocity widths up to @xmath11 . on the other hand",
    ", a correlation is observed between the velocity widths and metallicities of the dlas .",
    "in fact , the correlation is remarkably tight between the equivalent width of the  1526 transition ( a kinematic diagnostic because the line is saturated ) and gas metallicity @xcite that shows a slope matching the local velocity / metallicity relation in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "these correlations may be a consequence of a relation between the mass of the galaxies and their metallicities @xcite , or an indication that feedback from sf has a direct effect on the observed velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "to date all dlas exhibit metal - line absorption @xcite , and one expects that they will all show significant mgii equivalent widths .",
    "the opposite is not true ; the majority of mgii - selected absorbers are not dlas .",
    "unlike traditional low ions , mgii traces both cold and warm neutral material , as well as warm partially photoionized gas .",
    "recently , @xcite found a correlation between metallicity and the rest - frame mgii equivalent width , suggesting a link between kinematics and the metal - enrichment history of the absorber .",
    "they stressed that the absorption - line kinematics should be viewed separately from the host galaxy kinematics , in other words , the observed velocity widths need not scale directly with the mass of the dla - hosting halos .",
    "@xcite used the cross - correlation between 1806 mgii absorbers and @xmath12 luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey to find that the absorber halo mass is anti - correlated with the mg ii equivalent width , suggesting that at least part of the observed velocity dispersion in mgii regions is produced by supernova - driven winds and/or other feedback mechanisms which could drive cold and warm gas efficiently out of lower mass ( @xmath13 ) galaxies . on the other hand , this anti - correlation could also be interpreted as a transition from cold to shock - heated gas in more massive @xmath14 halos accompanied by a drop in the cumulative cross - section of neutral clouds found in these halos @xcite .",
    "at least for now , observational data are insufficient to find a relation between the absorbing halo mass and the velocity width @xmath0 of neutral absorption in dlas .",
    "therefore , we should consider at least three distinct physical mechanisms which could contribute especially to the high - end tail of the dla velocity distribution :    \\1 ) if cold clouds accreting onto massive galaxies are dense enough to survive collisional heating while falling into the hot ( @xmath15 ) virialized region , they could retain a sufficiently high neutral fraction with column densities above @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "note that for this mechanism to be viable , the accreting gas should be already sufficiently metal - rich , as even the most metal - poor dlas have been found to have metallicities @xmath17 , i.e. it would imply a model in which sf was ubiquitous at some time before @xmath5 in field galaxies of mass @xmath18 . in this scenario a large fraction of metals observed in dlas was produced far from massive ( @xmath19 ) halos where we see these metals in absorption .",
    "on the other hand , it is also possible that the low - metallicity accreting material could mix efficiently with the more metal - rich environment of the massive virialized halo .",
    "\\2 ) conversely , dla kinematics could be dominated by outflow velocities of supernova - driven winds , i.e. we could see feedback directly @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is indirectly supported by the high detected outflow velocities in lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , the higher effective widths @xmath20 of the siii @xmath21 transition in grb - dlas , and the anti - correlation between the absorbing halo mass and the effective line width in mgii absorbers .",
    "it would also naturally explain the metallicity - velocity correlation , since metals should be produced in the same regions which drive the winds .",
    "\\3 ) the apparent inefficiency of in - situ sf in dlas , coupled with their relatively high inferred cooling rates suggests a picture in which very compact star - forming regions , perhaps associated with lbgs , illuminate much more extended neutral gas structures @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a toy model of dla absorption to show that a large covering factor of the cold gas in protogalactic clumps is consistent with observations .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations confirm that massive halos at @xmath5 often consist of multiple compact galaxies embedded into larger neutral clouds .",
    "combined outflows from stellar winds and sne in these galaxies could drive large chunks of surrounding neutral material to larger galactic radii where they could pick up a higher velocity dispersion from the local galaxy group .",
    "although we now have absorption data on @xmath221000 dlas , very few groups have attempted to model dla kinematics in recent years .",
    "both analytical and numerical models in the literature tend to rely on a velocity dispersion put in by hand , in part because of our lack of understanding of the physical processes of sf and feedback on sub - galactic scales , and in part due to numerical resolution limitations .",
    "@xcite used an analytical model combining the press - schechter formalism with a picture of individual spherically symmetric halos consisting of multiple absorbing clouds to show that the rate of energy dissipation corresponding to the velocity dispersion of these clouds necessary to produce the observed line profiles far exceeds the rate at which energy can be supplied to these clouds by gravitational collapse and mergers of halos .",
    "they noted that a large fraction of dlas show multiple components in absorption profiles of the low - ionization lines , and that this observation can be reproduced by a model in which the missing dissipation energy comes from supernova explosions .",
    "in fact , the energy injection rate of @xmath23 reproduces well the fraction of multi - component dlas and the overall absorption line velocity width distribution with the median value of @xmath24 .",
    "however , their model does not provide the physical mechanism for transferring the feedback energy to the turbulent motions in gas clouds , apart from specifying the source of this energy .",
    "in addition , it is a highly approximate model which assumes spherical exponential halos consisting of discrete neutral clouds moving with a given velocity dispersion .",
    "moreover , the same feedback energy per unit mass is injected into all halos , independently of their mass , an assumption which probably puts too much velocity dispersion into small halos .    on the numerical front ,",
    "@xcite used cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations coupled to a phenomenological galactic wind model to compute the rate of incidence of dlas as a function of halo mass , galaxy apparent magnitude , and impact parameter , for a variable strength of hydrodynamical feedback . in their model , gas particles were driven out of dense sf regions by hand , by assigning a momentum in random directions .",
    "the wind mass loss rate was assumed to be twice the sf rate , and the wind carried a fixed fraction of the sn feedback energy , corresponding to the fixed wind velocities of @xmath25 ( weak wind ) and @xmath26 ( strong wind ) . depending on the strength of feedback , they found that it evacuated gas from predominantly low - mass galaxies and increased the cross - section and hence the rate of incidence of more massive galaxies . in their weak feedback model",
    "@xmath27 halos contributed the most to the cross - section , whereas with strong feedback the peak shifted to @xmath28 halos , depending on numerical resolution , as feedback became more and more efficient at removing gas from low - mass systems .",
    "although , @xcite did not analyze the velocity width statistics , one would expect to see numerous line profiles with @xmath29 in their models , due the increased incidence rate of massive galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we test a hypothesis that the observed kinematics is driven primarily by energy coming from gravitational infall in the process of hierarchical buildup of galaxies .",
    "this is essentially an extension of the idea put forward by @xcite that the observed dla line profiles are caused by a combination of random halo motions , rotation , and infall , coupled to the paradigm of several distinct modes of accretion onto growing proto - galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use the approach developed in our earlier paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , postprocessing high resolution adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations of galaxy formation with high - angular resolution radiative transfer of uv ionizing photons .",
    "we improved our algorithm in several ways including a better treatment of hydrodynamical heating during the radiative transfer stage , as well as taking into account sf and feedback .",
    "we experimented with a number of sf models , including the standard four - criterion model of @xcite and the two - mode sf model of @xcite , both of which can be tuned to give the observed sf rates in the absence of or with mild feedback . including strong feedback in our experience tends to always suppress an ongoing sf , either",
    "unless relevant scales in the clumpy interstellar medium ( ism ) are resolved , or interaction between the wind and the ambient medium has been turned off .",
    "it is well known that without any special treatment the feedback energy is quickly lost away in cooling .",
    "several prescriptions have been suggested to alleviate this problem ; popular algorithms used in particle - based galaxy formation models are ( 1 ) turning off cooling of gas particles in the feedback regions @xcite and ( 2 ) using a subresolution model for the multiphase ism @xcite usually coupled with kinematic feedback in which individual multiphase gas particles are driven out of the star - forming regions in random or specified directions .    grid - based amr simulations in which feedback energy is simply converted into the gas thermal energy seem to be quite effective in limiting sf , although this efficiency certainly depends on numerical and temporal resolution . in the grid - based simulations presented in section  [ amrmodels ] we do not suppress cooling or use any kinematic outflow model , in other words , we enforce a fairly conservative approximation to the role of sf in dla kinematics , largely limited to conversion of some fraction of gas into stars .    in the second half of this paper ( sec .",
    "[ sphmodels ] ) we examine dla kinematics with treesph models in which radiative cooling is suppressed in regions surrounding active sf sites .",
    ".simulation parameters.[modellist ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the scatter in figure  [ velmass ] is quite large .",
    "apart from the resolution effects , there is a correlation between the observed median @xmath0 and the circular velocity , although this dependence has a flatter slope than the @xmath30 found by @xcite .",
    "moreover , we see that this relation might break at higher masses where individual halos consist of multiple components , and unless these components are resolved the median of the observed velocity widths can be as small as @xmath31 .    in the top panel of figure  [ temphalo ] we plotted the mass - weighted gas temperature    @xmath32    averaged over the virial spheres of all halos in a given mass bin , as a function of that mass .",
    "only halos containing at least 100 dm particles are included .",
    "it is evident that a significant fraction of the gas fails to heat to the virial temperature , since its cooling is fairly efficient and the infall velocities are relatively small .",
    "this result was first pointed out by @xcite and more recently by @xcite , who showed that in one - dimensional models a virial shock does not develop in halos below some redshift - dependent critical mass .",
    "we find that in nested grid models lower - mass halos have the mean temperature well above their virial temperature ( fig .",
    "[ temphalo ] ) indicating that they are found close to the virial radii of more massive halos and are being heated by the gas falling into the potential wells of their massive neighbors .",
    "a fit to all halos with @xmath33 , i.e. halos not affected by this ram - pressure heating , produces a relationship    @xmath34    which has a steeper slope than that of the virial temperature ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this result can be also demonstrated by the mass fraction @xmath36 of gas at @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ temphalo ] ) . due to shock heating this",
    "fraction decreases with increasing halo mass , but in lower - mass ( @xmath38 ) systems most gas can be actually found in the cold phase . as expected , the fraction @xmath36 traces the amount of neutral gas in halos , as can be seen from the lower panel of figure  [ temphalo ] , where we plotted the ratio of the mass - weighted neutral fraction    @xmath39    to @xmath36 . in order to explain dla kinematics with large velocity widths of low - ionization species , we need a sufficiently large cold fraction @xmath36 of gas in massive halos which have a high velocity dispersion . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that halos above a certain mass scale may not contribute significantly to the observed neutral gas absorption due to shock heating of their baryons @xcite .",
    "therefore , our goal is to determine precisely the fraction of cold gas inside compact clouds and/or accretion filaments which survive shock heating while falling into the massive halos . to have a large velocity dispersion , we need to maximize the number of such clouds intersected by any single line of sight going through the halo . in our simulations",
    "as much as @xmath40 of all gas in @xmath41 halos is at @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ temphalo ] ) , however , this amount of cold material does not automatically produce the observed velocity dispersion .    one can argue that the spatial distribution of neutral clouds inside collapsed halos is equally important for probing the velocity space .",
    "could improved numerical resolution change this distribution ? without running higher resolution models of isolated galaxies and understanding the physics of feedback on the scale of typical neutral structures in the ism of absorber galaxies , it is very difficult to extrapolate our results to higher resolution . even in our current models resolution effects",
    "show up in several different ways .",
    "first of all , in more massive ( @xmath42 ) halos high mass resolution assists early collapse onto a larger number of low - mass dm clumps , as opposed to slower accretion via filamentary flows onto more massive and more centrally concentrated dm halos at somewhat lower redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ h1-nh - zoom ] ) .",
    "higher grid resolution leads to more efficient cooling and in general more compact shock heated regions , resulting in a higher survival probability of neutral clouds falling on massive virialized halos .",
    "the combined effect of higher mass and grid resolution in massive environments is the increased line - of - sight velocity dispersion in a larger number of compact ( @xmath43 ) neutral gas clouds , as several of these clouds can be normally intersected by a line of sight going through such a halo .",
    "the resulting spectra feature multiple components and the combined velocity widths of up to @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ onehalovelocity ] ) , with a median @xmath0 value close to @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ velmass ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in lower - mass environments , such as isolated @xmath45 halos and filaments , higher numerical resolution yields a more numerous halo population , and consequently , many more neutral clouds .",
    "these clouds are sufficiently isolated so that very few of them fall on the same line of sight , and the velocity dispersion in individual clouds is too small to contribute to the large observed velocity tail , independently of resolution .",
    "however , these lower - mass environments supply the majority of low @xmath0 absorbers and are an important contributor to the overall column density distribution .    ideally , to combine the benefits of models of different volumes and resolutions , one would like to convolve the incidence rates in figure  [ incidencemass ] with the velocity distributions from figure  [ velmass ] , using the best resolved halos in each mass bin in both distributions and adding intergalactic dlas .",
    "note that our @xmath46 models represent fairly small volumes and are therefore subject to the large cosmic variance .",
    "unfortunately , these small volumes are also the most expensive to compute , as they start to resolve the ism , and the fraction of the volume which is refined adaptively rises steeply .",
    "we now turn to high - resolution galaxy formation models computed with the treesph code @xcite which , unlike enzo , uses particle representation of the fluid . sf",
    "is similarly modeled with a set of discrete star particles which represent a population of stars born at the same time .",
    "two distinct modes of sf depending on the thermal history of the star - forming gas are used : ( 1 ) early and very efficient ( @xmath47 ) sf from gas which has always been cooler than @xmath48 and is found above a critical density @xmath49 , and ( 2 ) a late mode with much lower efficiency ( @xmath50 ) fueled by gas which has been heated to temperatures above @xmath51 and has subsequently cooled down to be found in clouds with density above @xmath52 .    for our purposes",
    "the most important difference between the two codes lies in implementation of feedback . in enzo feedback energy",
    "is injected into the thermal energy of the ism which is then allowed to be radiated away on a cooling timescale resulting in a very conservative realization of feedback . in the treesph code feedback",
    "is modeled in accordance with a given initial mass function ( imf ) , however , cooling is suppressed in the feedback regions for the duration of the starburst , resulting in a much more efficient expansion of the heated gas into the surrounding medium .",
    "this latter approach has been shown to preserve a larger fraction of angular momentum in the baryonic component as it settles into rotationally supported disks , and to lead to more realistic disks at @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "can these state - of - the - art models reproduce the observed dla kinematics at @xmath5 ?    to address this question , we selected three halos from a dark matter - only run of box length @xmath54 which was then resimulated with the treesph code at higher resolution in lagrangian regions enclosing the galaxies , with gas ( and star ) particle masses of @xmath55 .",
    "two of these halos ( 15 and 18 ) would form massive galaxies at @xmath53 , and the third one ( scl54 ) would form a cluster . at @xmath56",
    "their virial masses are @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . in the latter proto - cluster run sf and",
    "feedback is modeled with a set of discrete star particles assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "one of the proto - galaxies ( ay18 ) was modeled with a top - heavy arimoto - yoshii imf , and the other proto - galaxy was rerun twice , once with the salpeter ( s15 ) and once with the arimoto - yoshii ( ay15 ) imfs , respectively .",
    "we then took these halos at @xmath56 and projected them onto a hierarchy of nested grids with interpolated grid resolution of @xmath60 for the two proto - galaxies and @xmath61 for the proto - cluster .",
    "we postprocessed these datasets with the uvb radiative transfer using the same algorithm as for our grid - based simulations ( sec .",
    "[ rt ] ) , and with transfer of stellar ionizing photons using the adaptive ray splitting method described in @xcite .",
    "the stellar uv luminosity is determined using the population synthesis package starburst 1999 @xcite with continuous sf distributed among all stars younger than @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ colvel - jesper-2.95 ] shows the differential hi column density and cumulative @xmath0 velocity width distributions for the four models .",
    "these distributions were computed with the random sightlines passing through the resimulated volumes which have the average densities in excess of the mean density of the universe at @xmath56 .",
    "therefore we should expect more absorption than from a truly representative large cosmological volume , which is evident in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ colvel - jesper-2.95 ] .",
    "however , since these volumes contain massive environments , they should exhibit a higher neutral gas velocity dispersion than a larger cosmological volume .",
    "the median @xmath0 velocity width for models s15 , ay15 , ay18 , and scl54 is 32 , 34 , 31 , and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "this is a surprising result , as with suppression of cooling in the feedback regions one would expect to see a more efficient conversion of feedback energy into hydrodynamical expansion and , therefore , higher outflow velocities .",
    "in fact , we see that increasing the strength of feedback has some effect on velocities .",
    "ay15 is the same proto - galaxy as s15 , resimulated with the top - heavy arimoto - yoshii imf with stronger feedback .",
    "figure  [ colvel - jesper-2.95 ] shows that more energetic feedback removes gas from higher column densities and produces a larger fraction of high - velocity dlas , although the median @xmath0 changes only slightly from 32 to @xmath64 .",
    "note that our kinematics results are independent of the assumed uvb .",
    "changing the amplitude and hardness of the uvb does not alleviate the lack of high - velocity systems , as it affects primarily lower column density absorbers , and since there is effectively no correlation between the velocity widths and column densities ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ scatter - colvel - boxsize ] ) , changing the uvb just adds or removes both low- and high - velocity dlas from the simulated sample .",
    "we have performed a numerical study of dla kinematics using high - resolution grid - based amr simulations with moderate feedback , as well as particle - based sph models with much more efficient feedback . with grid - based models our goal was to test the hypothesis that the observed velocity dispersion in dlas could be explained by energy coming from gravitational collapse of cosmic structures .",
    "the broadest line profiles would then come from neutral clouds surviving infall into the massive virialized ( @xmath42 ) systems , as a @xmath65 halo at @xmath5 has a circular velocity already in excess of @xmath66 .",
    "we used a series of models with a comoving volume size ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 and the maximum physical resolution of @xmath69 to build a dla population covering halos in the mass range @xmath70 .",
    "although our models can reproduce well the total incidence rate of dlas at @xmath5 , our median @xmath0 velocities are of order @xmath71 , well below the observed value of @xmath2 .",
    "we can point out three possibilities to resolve this discrepancy :    \\1 .",
    "_ more massive environments  _ the velocity dispersion in individual clouds is a strong function of mass",
    ". therefore , one could expect that including more massive halos through sampling of the rare density peaks could alleviate the velocity problem . on the other hand ,",
    "all our 4 - 16 mpc high resolution models feature similar velocity tails ( fig .",
    "[ colvel - boxsize ] ) even though the mass function in the @xmath72 model l1 extends to nearly 50 times more massive halos than in the @xmath73 model n1 .",
    "therefore it seems unlikely that the more massive ( @xmath74 ) and consequently much rarer halos could make any substantial contribution to the overall statistics , even though each individual halo could have a velocity dispersion of several hundred @xmath75 .    note that including only massive halos in larger simulation volumes might produce @xmath76 at low @xmath9 which is too small @xcite or too large , depending on the technique . in our simulations neglecting low - mass halos can actually raise @xmath76 at low column densities , as all the gas which would otherwise be pulled in by low - mass halos stays in extended filaments which sometimes can produce column densities @xmath77 . on the other hand , our larger @xmath78 models h0 and h1 do not have enough grid resolution to resolve these filaments , and hence produce small line densities @xmath79 .",
    "_ resolution  _ our current simulations are already very expensive computationally as we refine adaptively everywhere in the volume , and the @xmath80 base grid models have in practice @xmath81 to @xmath82 resolution elements .",
    "if we start from @xmath83 or a larger base grid , many more halos will form drawing in a larger fraction of baryons at earlier redshifts , whereas inside individual galaxies we will start resolving clumpy interstellar gas . however , without running these simulations and sampling a large number of galaxies at higher resolution , it is impossible to predict reliably the effect on the velocity and column density distributions .",
    "in addition , higher resolution would allow us to better model propagation of supernova - driven winds in the clumpy interstellar gas .",
    "the key question is the relative contribution of lower mass ( @xmath84 ) and more massive ( @xmath85 ) halos . in our current models",
    "these two populations contribute about equally to the total `` galactic '' dla column density ( fig .",
    "[ incidencemass ] ) .",
    "it is possible that at higher resolution the relative contribution of the more massive halos might grow , as they will feature more numerous spatially separated components falling on the same line of sight , perhaps with neutral gas tidal tails and bridges , whereas isolated lower mass galaxies could become even more compact and pull the remaining cold neutral gas from extended filamentary structures decreasing its covering factor on the sky .",
    "unfortunately , the spatial distribution of absorbing clouds can not be reconstructed from the observed line profiles in the velocity space , which would otherwise point to the minimum scale needed to resolve muli - component dlas .",
    "@xcite studied an almost dust free dla at @xmath86 featuring 14 resolved metal line components .",
    "they found very similar z / fe ratios of low - ionization species in all 14 components , suggesting that these components could originate in clouds physically located in a small region of space , perhaps much smaller than the resolution limit of our current simulations .",
    "\\3 . _ local microphysics  _ the most intriguing possibility is that the observed velocity dispersion could arise as a result of feedback from sf . more efficient",
    "feedback could disrupt the highest column density absorbers ( @xmath87 ) in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ scatter - colvel - boxsize ] creating a population of low @xmath9 systems with high velocity widths .",
    "with such a disruption mechanism put in by hand with the galactic wind model , @xcite saw efficient gas removal from lower - mass ( @xmath45 ) halos and increased cross - sections in @xmath42 halos . in view of our results ,",
    "a model in which more efficient feedback is obtained without resorting to the unphysical assumptions of kinematic winds and/or suppressing cooling in feedback regions would seem particularly compelling .",
    "the key challenge here is to come up with a model which describes dynamics of individual components of the multiphase ism separately from each other , either resolving them explicitly , or using a subresolution model in which different components are advected differently on a grid . in these models",
    "supernova winds would channel most of their energy into the lower density regions between the star - forming clouds , whereas the clouds would be more likely to survive the disruptive effect of the winds .",
    "in section  [ sphmodels ] we used treesph models to test the effect that the suppression of cooling has on neutral gas kinematics .",
    "we found the median velocity widths @xmath0 of only 31 to @xmath64 , even though that these models have been shown to expel gas efficiently from the star - forming regions at high redshifts and produce realistic galactic disks at @xmath53 .",
    "in our view , such low velocity dispersion could be explained by a number of factors .",
    "a. _ resolution ",
    "_ when numerical models do not resolve density inhomogeneities in the ism , putting a certain amount of supernova feedback into the thermal energy of the gas and turning off cooling leads to an efficient conversion of this energy into the superwind expansion into a nearly uniform medium .",
    "however , the mass loading of the wind in a uniform medium is much larger than in a clumpy medium of the same average density , since in the latter case the wind will predominantly expand into the lower density voids between the clumps creating a high velocity outflow which will occasionally sweep chunks of neutral material off the edges of denser clouds .",
    "clumps of gas entrained in winds are often observed in low - redshift outflows @xcite . on the other hand , at low resolution winds",
    "will displace most gas in the galaxy moving it to somewhat higher galactic radii , producing `` puffy '' galaxies with a relatively low velocity dispersion .",
    "this is exactly what we see in sph simulations at @xmath60 physical resolution .",
    "the expectation is that at higher resolution we should see multiphase outflows , with higher overall velocities in hot ionized gas , and numerous dense clouds giving rise to multi - component low - ionization absorption lines .",
    "getting such galactic winds from first principles is notoriously difficult in numerical simulations . in this paper",
    ", we argue that the necessary condition for obtaining the correct dla velocity dispersion is a separate dynamical treatment of different components of the multiphase interstellar medium at @xmath5 .",
    "b. _ mean redshift of feedback  _ a realistic population of galaxies at @xmath53 can be obtained in cosmological simulations invoking early ( @xmath88 ) episodes of star formation with energetic feedback @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the radial distribution of gas and its angular momentum arise as a cumulative result of successive episodes of star formation driving gas out of the galaxies .",
    "other model parameters might result in similar star formation histories ; not all parameters can be constrained uniquely from observations .",
    "one could speculate that a different star formation history , e.g. one featuring energetic feedback down to redshift @xmath89 , would produce a higher neutral hydrogen velocity dispersion at such a redshift .",
    "we note that from the spectra of @xmath90 lbgs , outflow velocities of @xmath91 are routinely inferred ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note , however , also that @xcite were able to match both the magnitude and radial fall - off of ly@xmath1 surface brightness of typical @xmath89 galaxies , indicating that the spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen is correctly predicted by current sph models .",
    "c. _ agn feedback  _ it is possible that the core of each massive galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole which might have shown an agn - type activity at some time in the past .",
    "neither grid - based nor particle - based simulations presented in this paper include feedback from agns which could have a profound impact on gas kinematics in host galaxies .",
    "feedback from star formation is generally thought to play an important role in galaxy evolution .",
    "if galactic winds give rise to the observed neutral gas kinematics in dlas , the same winds should affect the column density distribution . in paper i and in this paper ,",
    "we have attempted to look at both distributions through large - scale , `` blind - survey '' models , in which we simulate cosmological volumes using aggressive grid refinement for all galaxies .",
    "however , these models are very expensive to compute , especially as we get closer to resolving the typical scales of the ism .",
    "perhaps , a more efficient approach is to combine these large - scale numerical surveys with simulations of the ism in isolated galaxies , whether or not accounting for mergers and cosmic infall .",
    "fortunately , there is sufficient amount of observational data which can be used to constrain these models .",
    "combining traditional qso - dla data with a closer look at the high - redshift star - forming regions with grb - dlas and with emission line studies should allow us to learn a lot more about young proto - galaxies in coming years .",

    "<S> we show that a relative shortage of such high - velocity neutral gas absorbers in state - of - the - art galaxy formation models is a fundamental problem , present both in grid - based and particle - based numerical simulations . using a series of numerical simulations of varying resolution and box size to cover a wide range of halo masses , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that energy from gravitational infall alone is insufficient to produce the velocity dispersion observed in damped ly@xmath1 systems , nor does this dispersion arise from an implementation of star formation and feedback in our highest resolution ( @xmath6 ) models , if we do not put any galactic winds into our models by hand . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these numerical experiments highlight the need to separate dynamics of different components of the multiphase interstellar medium at @xmath5 . </S>"
