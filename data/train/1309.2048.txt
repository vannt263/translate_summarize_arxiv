    "in the collinear factorization framework the scattering amplitudes for exclusive processes such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite @xmath0 and its crossed reaction , timelike compton scattering ( tcs ) @xcite @xmath1 have been shown to factorize in specific kinematical regions , provided a large scale controls the separation of short distance dominated partonic subprocesses and long distance hadronic matrix elements , the generalized quark and gluon distributions ( gpds ) @xcite which encode much information on the partonic content of nucleons .",
    "after factorization , the dvcs ( and similarly tcs ) amplitudes are written in terms of compton form factors ( cff ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , as : @xmath6 u(p )   \\nonumber \\ , , \\label{eq : amplcff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the cffs defined as @xmath7 we report in sect .",

    ", width=264 ]    tcs and dvcs amplitudes are identical ( up to a complex conjugation ) at lowest order in @xmath13 but differ at next to leading order , in particular because of the quite different analytic structure of the scattering amplitudes of these reactions .",
    "indeed , the production of a timelike photon enables the production of intermediate states in some channels which are kinematically forbidden in the dvcs case .",
    "this opens the way to new absorptive parts of the amplitude . to estimate compton form factors ( cff ) , we use the nlo calculations of the coefficient functions which have been calculated in the dvcs case in the early days of gpd studies and more recently for the tcs case @xcite , the two results being simply related thanks to the analyticity ( in @xmath14 ) properties of the amplitude @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16  @xmath17 sign corresponds to vector ( axial ) case .    using two gpd models based on double distributions ( dds ) , as discussed in detail in ref .",

    ", one sees that gluonic contributions are so important that they even change the sign of the real part of the cff , and are dominant for almost all values of the skewness parameter .",
    "a milder conclusion arises from a similar comparison of the lower panels ; the gluonic contribution to the imaginary part of the cff remains sizeable for values of the skewness parameter up to @xmath20 .    ) .",

    "[ fig : c1 ] and fig .",

    "the difference between the dotted and solid lines demonstrates that nlo contributions are important , whereas the difference between the dashed and solid lines shows that gluon contributions should not be forgotten even at low energy when a precise data set is analyzed .",
    "timelike compton scattering in ultraperipheral collisions at hadron colliders opens a new way to measure generalized parton distributions , in particular for very small values of the skewness parameter .",
    "we estimated @xcite the different contributions to the lepton pair cross section for ultraperipheral collisions at the lhc .",
    "since the cross sections decrease rapidly with @xmath14 , we are interested in the kinematics of moderate @xmath14 , say a few gev@xmath10 , and large energy , thus very small values of @xmath23 .",
    "note however that for a given proton energy the photon flux is higher at smaller photon energy .",
    "the bethe - heitler amplitude grows much when small @xmath24 angles are allowed . in the following",
    "we will use the limits @xmath25 $ ] where the bethe - heitler cross section is sufficiently big but does not dominate too much over the compton process . the bethe - heitler cross section integrated over",

    "since the amplitudes for the compton and bethe - heitler processes transform with opposite signs under reversal of the lepton charge , the interference term between tcs and bh is odd under exchange of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 momenta .",
    "it is thus possible to project out the interference term through a clever use of the angular distribution of the lepton pair .",
    "the interference part of the cross - section for @xmath35 with unpolarized protons and photons has a characteristic ( @xmath36 ) dependence given by ( see details in @xcite ) @xmath37 with @xmath38 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are compton form factors . with the integration limits symmetric about @xmath42 the interference term changes sign under @xmath43 due to charge conjugation , whereas the tcs and bh cross sections do not .",
    "one may thus extract the compton amplitude through a study of @xmath44 .         in fig .",
    "[ interf ] we show the interference contribution to the cross section in comparison to the bethe - heitler and compton processes , for various values of photon proton energy squared @xmath45 .",
    "we observe that for larger energies the compton process dominates , whereas for @xmath46 all contributions are comparable .",
    "the main idea of the multi - purpose project after@lhc is to extract the halo of the lhc proton or ion beams by means of a bent - cristal and to use it as a beam in the fixed - target experiments @xcite .",
    "the extracted beams will have a sufficiently high energy to produce on fixed target in ultraperipheral scattering a lepton pair with high invariant mass or heavy mesons . in these experiments a nucleus projectile or a nucleus target is treated as a high - energy photon source which allows study of photon - hadron collisions .",
