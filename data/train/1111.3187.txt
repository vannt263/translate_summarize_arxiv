    "@xcite the case where do exist several different mather measures is analyzed and the question of selection of the limit projected mather measure is considered .",
    "in @xcite the problem is described in a different setting and in terms of the quantum action .",
    "this result is for the torus of dimension @xmath19 .    in the general case",
    "the mather measures are singular with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "on the geodesic case for negative curvature manifolds these measures are supported on geodesic laminations ( appendix @xcite ) and a large deviation principle is known under the hypothesis of uniqueness of the maximizing probability . for nonnegative curvature the large deviation problem around a closed geodesic with only points of curvature zero",

    "if @xmath129 denotes the wigner distribution associated to the evans critical @xmath89 , then @xmath0 converges to the mather measure on the tangent bundle . in this case",
    ", the mather measure is the unique invariant measure for the euler - lagrange flow on a certain energy level ( which depends on @xmath66 ) .    moreover ,",
    "consider a smooth function @xmath130 supported on a compact set @xmath131    1 .",
    "if the support of @xmath130 does intersect the energy level @xmath132 then @xmath133 for certain functions @xmath134 and @xmath135 with @xmath136 + the value @xmath137 appears in a natural way and is responsible for the normalization which assures us that we get a probability in the limit .",
    "the right hand side is just the canonical expression of the invariant density for the hamiltonian flow via action - angle variables .",
    "2 .   if the support of @xmath130 does not intersect the energy level @xmath132 then @xmath138    in both cases case we are able to estimate the speed of convergence .",
    "our measure convergence claim is in the following sense : @xmath0 converges to @xmath139 if @xmath140 for each smooth functions @xmath130 with the property that its support does not intersect two certain lines @xmath141 and @xmath142 to be defined in the following section .",
    "the symmetry hypothesis on @xmath24 simplifies our computations , but our method can be adapted to more general situations ( taking up much more pages ) .",
    "for instance , just below this symmetry hypothesis results in the same property for the viscosity solution , and this makes the analysis of the problem much more simple .    in the proof of our theorem",
    "we obtain an estimate of the velocity of the convergence of @xmath143 for a certain class of test function @xmath144 with compact support , where @xmath0 is the wigner distribution associated to the family @xmath145 in addition , we also establish the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of and when @xmath63 this requires a rigorous asymptotic expansion analysis which , to the best of our knowledge , can not be found in the existing literature .",
    "it is true that in this one - dimensional case we could avoid the mention of mather measures , and consider only invariant measures on constant energy levels but since we are going to use the setting and the results of @xcite , which are presented in the context of the aubry - mather theory , we believe that our discussion so far could be helpful .    note that if one knew in advance that the limit of the wigner distribution is an invariant measure for the hamiltonian flow , the result would be trivial , because we are in a situation where there is a unique invariant measure on each energy level .",
    "however , @xmath146 is only a @xmath147-quasimode of the quantum hamiltonian ( this was proved by c. evans @xcite ) and we do not know a priori that the limits of the wigner measures are invariant .",
    "the proof relies on the facts that the phase space picture is completely explicit , that the aubry - mather measure is unique , and that the solution to the hamilton - jacobi equation is unique , smooth , and explicit ; thus , this approach is specific to dimension 1 .",
    "the semiclassical limit of wigner measures that minimize the quantum action was considered in @xcite .",
    "this was inspired by the previous work @xcite which only uses classical tools .",
    "we now revisit this problem and compute the rates of convergence ( above the critical level of energy ) for one - dimensional hamiltonians .",
    "we will consider @xmath148 , where @xmath149    concerning possible extensions of our results to higher dimensions , we acknowledge that the control of the stationary phase method in the first part of our work , although being much more difficult , could possibly be obtained .",
    "anyway , in the last part of our work ( see section 3 ) we have to control an asymptotic expansion , for which we need a mather measure that projects on the entire torus .",
    "we strongly believe that this control is not obtainable with our methods without that assumption .",
    "an extension in this direction will require a completely different approach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive the correct asymptotic behavior of the integrals over wigner measures when @xmath12 . in the last section",
    "we describe the asymptotic expansion of the function @xmath16 in terms of @xmath150 which we will need for the proof of theorem [ teo1 ] .",
    "the critical wigner measure is the wigner measure associated to a critical solution @xmath89 . for simplicity we will omit the word critical from now on .",
    "we want to investigate the asymptotic limit of wigner measures , when @xmath12 .",
    "remember that @xmath151 , hence for any continuous @xmath130 with support on a compact set @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154}e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i \\hat{p } y}{h } } \\;dx dy.\\ ] ]    note that , as @xmath155 ; @xmath156 } , we can write    @xmath153 @xmath157}e^{-2\\pi i m y } \\;dx dy.\\ ] ]    note that the integrand is periodic on the variable @xmath158    we point out that the analysis of the case of integrals of functions depending only on @xmath9 , namely , @xmath159 , is well known .",
    "it follows from the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the projection of the above wigner measures converges to the projected mather measure ( on the torus ) @xcite and large deviations are also well understood ( in the case the mather probability is unique ) according to proposition 3.11 @xcite .    in the one - dimensional case ( above the @xmath9-axis )",
    "the level of energy consist exactly of one periodic trajectory when @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , note that if the energy is high the modulus of the velocities on this level of energy is high , and , therefore , by conservation of energy the level of energy has to be a curve like the one on the top of figure 1 .",
    "so , it follows from the graph property @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite that the mather probability has support in this periodic trajectory .",
    "the case of @xmath160 ( where @xmath66 attains the minimum value of @xmath161 ) requires a different analysis and will not be considered here .",
    "we will show later that @xmath125 converges to the mather measure which has support in such trajectory .",
    "for @xmath148 , let us find the backward viscosity solution of @xmath162 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath163 then @xmath164 is a solution , and hence a viscosity solution , of @xmath162 .",

    "the function @xmath166 is such that its graph determines a level of energy @xmath167(as for example the curve shown on the top of figure 1 ) .",
