    "excitation of localized levels in solids , especially in metals , can lead to a variety of many body scattering processes , as can be revealed e.g. in x - ray photoemission spectra from these levels .",
    "these phenomena and the information that they provided about the structure and local dynamics of electrons in such systems was among reasons that they were extensively studied even since the pioneering theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "observation of asymmetric lineshapes was often used as an indicator of the metallicity of the system .",
    "the extension of these studies to new materials , like graphene , led to renewed interest in the application and interpretation of various spectroscopies to these systems . in this paper",
    "we therefore provide theoretical prediction of core level photoemission spectra from pristine and doped graphene , discuss in detail the core level lineshapes and the possibility that they reveal singular behaviour , as is the case in metals .    in sec.[sec2 ]",
    "we briefly derive expressions for a localised level spectrum , corresponding to the @xmath0 level of carbon , interacting with electronic excitations , which are described by the nonlocal dynamically screened coulomb interaction",
    ". we shall neglect extrinsic ( photoelectron ) scattering processes , in which case the measured photoelectron spectrum corresponds to the core hole spectrum . in sec.[sec3 ] we present an analytic discussion of possible singularities in xps lineshapes using asymptotic expressions for the singularity index . and conclude that they can occur only in doped graphene .",
    "this may in principle open the possibility to directly connect doping and line asymmetry , but later in a more exact calculation we show the validity of these asymptotic results . in sec.[sec4 ]",
    "we present methodology we use in the calculation of the propagator of dynamically screened coulomb interaction in graphene . with this full propagator in sec.[sec5 ]",
    "we calculate singularity indices in pristine and doped graphene and compare them with the previous approximate results .",
    "we show that , unlike the situation in the metals , the singularity indices @xmath1 vary in a much more complicated way . for @xmath2 they indeed start from their asymptotic values , but soon the reverse situation occurs : in pristine graphene @xmath1 increases above the value in doped graphene , which decreases until it reaches the 2d plasmon peak .",
    "the fact is that @xmath3 , hole decay linewidth , pair and plasmon energies all lie in the same energy region , so that detailed calculations become necessary . in sec.[sec6 ] we present a method for calculation of the complete core - hole spectrum and its various properties . in sec.[allspe ] we use this method to calculate and discuss the shapes and properties of c1s core hole spectra in graphene .",
    "we also compare them with the existing experimental results , pointing out possible incorrect interpretation of measured c1s core hole lineshapes in xps .",

    "for @xmath70 the singularity index @xmath62 indeed starts from the zero , but very soon , on the scale of the core hole linewidth @xmath33 , it increases due to @xmath143 interband transitions . on the other hand , for @xmath85 and @xmath142  ev",
    "the @xmath62 starts at finite value , as predicted by the asymptotic result ( [ jurc ] ) , which would indicate singular behaviour , but it immediately decreases as the @xmath144 intraband transitions decrease , but a new collective mode gives a strong peak at the 2d plasmon frequency @xcite . at even higher energies",
    "interband @xmath143 transitions dominate , and give the same contributions for all graphene dopings .",
    "we can compare these results with those for a 3d metal @xcite , where @xmath62 is quite constant in a larger @xmath77 region almost up to the appearance of the first plasmon peak .",
    "strong variation of @xmath62 in graphene could lead to core hole lineshapes showing a combined effect of singular hole relaxation and hole decay processes which all occur in the same energy region , as we shall see in sec.[allspe ] .",
    "once we have calculated the function @xmath138 we can calculate complete spectrum given by ( [ spectrum ] ) , e.g. the core hole energy shift @xmath145 and the strength of the no - loss line @xmath146 .",
    "let us first analyze the case @xmath78 , i.e. for @xmath147 for @xmath88 .",
    "it turns out that expanding the exponent in ( [ spectrum ] ) is not a satisfactory procedure because already the first term in the expansion @xmath148 where @xmath149 , would vanish , and the expansion ( [ expa ] ) is therefore meaningless .",
    "if we approximate @xmath62 by its asymptotic ( constant ) value @xmath150 , we can calculate the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) analytically to obtain the doniach - unji ' c ( ds ) asymmetric lineshape @xcite @xmath151}{\\left(\\tilde{\\omega}^{2}+\\gamma^{2}\\right)^{\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)/2}}\\ ] ] with the maximum at @xmath152 incidentally , this maximum is not the shifted elastic line ( which is suppressed in this case ) but corresponds to the inelastic structure due to a large number of soft electron - hole pairs .",
    "this expression is correct only in the low - energy ( e.g. @xmath75 ) part of the spectrum .",

    "the core hole spectra can be calculated from @xmath161 with @xmath162 obtained self - consistently from ( [ minn1 ] ) and ( [ minn2 ] ) , and for the singularity index @xmath163 calculated from ( [ alfa ] ) .",
    "this method enables us to calculate the whole normalised spectrum , but we shall first analyze the strength of the no - loss peak , i.e. the @xmath164 pole contribution to the spectrum in the lorentzian form @xmath165 from ( [ minn2 ] ) one finds @xmath166 for the decay constant @xmath33 , where @xmath167 is the strength of the residuum , @xmath168 or alternatively , @xmath169",
    "in fig.[spectra ] we show core hole spectra calculated using the formalism of sec.[sec6 ] for pristine graphene ( @xmath70 ) and two dopings , @xmath85 and @xmath142ev . in pristine graphene @xmath170 , so ds lineshape @xmath171 reduces to the lorentzian @xmath172 .",
    "however , if we depart from this approximation and calculate the spectrum with the full @xmath62 , we obtain a noticeable low energy tail , which is due to the interband @xmath143 transitions , as is visible in a rapid increase of @xmath62 in fig.[alpha ] .",
    "it is easy to mistake it for a singular many - electron tail , i.e. to interpret the lineshape in fig.[spectra]a as the ds lineshape , e.g. in fig.[spectra]b . in order to clarify this",
    "we have analyzed the spectrum @xmath173 in fig.[spectra]a by calculating the spectrum @xmath174 , which includes only first order processes ( fig.[spectra1 ] ) , and we see that they give a dominant contribution to this low energy tail .",

    "however , full calculation modifies this asymptotic result as the series of discrete 2d plasmon peaks appears in fig.[spectra]c at energies @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180ev .",
    "important information about the strength of many - electron excitations can be obtained from the strength of the no - loss line @xmath181 , which depends on the doping @xmath3 and the hole decay constant @xmath33 , and is shown in fig.[noloss ] .     for pristine graphene @xmath70 ( solid line ) and doped graphene @xmath86  ev ( dashed line ) .",
    "]    we see that the elastic line is fully destroyed only for extremely small hole decay constants @xmath33 , but for realistic values it is substantially reduced , indicating strong inelastic scattering which amounts to @xmath182 of the total spectral weight .    another related quantity confirming this conclusion is the ground - state energy shift @xmath145 , eq.[zjoksi ] , which is connected with the total inelastic spectrum by the spectral sum rule ( [ saspi ] ) , so that @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "fig.[enshift ] shows core hole energy shift as a function of the core hole position and graphene doping .",
    "first we observe that the core hole energy shift does not depend on the hole decay constant @xmath33 , as can be shown analytically from eq.[spectrum ] .",
    "when the core - hole is outside graphene ( beyond the graphene electronic density edge ) the energy shift follows the image potential curves ( taken from ref.@xcite ) up to very close distances ( 4.a.u . from the graphene center ) and is mostly due to the long - range @xmath143 derived plasmon excitations . at shorter distances , as one would expect , the quantum mechanical dispersion reduces the polarization shift . energy shift in the center of the graphene ( black dots ) is smaller than at the unit supercell edges ( vertical dotted lines ) .",
    "this behavior is expected , namely the maximum energy shift should appear exactly at the centroid of the induced charge which is for graphene at @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "this induced charge originates mainly from transitions between @xmath186 and @xmath187 orbitals . on the other hand",
    "@xmath186 orbitals have nodes exactly at the graphene center and that is the reason why the energy shift at the graphene center behaves as for the core hole just outside graphene .",

    "let us now compare these theoretical predictions with the experimental observation of singular lineshapes in graphene .",
    "photoemission spectra involving c1s line in graphene have been reported in a number of papers @xcite , but the primary purpose of these measurements was to determine , e.g. structural , chemical or transport properties , growth mechanisms , influence of substrate or temperature on these properties , etc .",
    "nevertheless , in several cases measured lineshapes were fitted to the ds asymmetric profiles @xcite , and even singularity indices were determined @xcite .",
    "so , e.g. gruneis at al @xcite fit the measured c1s spectrum to the ds lineshape with @xmath189  mev and @xmath190 , which is compatible with the earlier results in ref.@xcite for graphene monolayers deposited on various metallic substrates , where ds lineshapes were also used with @xmath83 between @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "no doping was assumed nor discussed in these papers , though it should play an important role in determining the asymmetry and possible singular character of core hole lineshapes .",
    "also one should consider the influence of the substrate on deposited graphene monolayer .",
    "the influence of the substrate could be twofold .",
    "on one hand it could lead to the charge transfer and doping of the graphene monolayer . on the other ,",
    "if the substrate is metallic , the hole in the graphene monolayer can interact with the electrons in the substrate , and also show singular lineshapes , as shown in @xcite .",
    "all these factors should be taken into account when trying to determine whether the observed asymmetry is due to singular excitations of electron - hole pairs , or to low - order scattering processes . in any case , it turns out that the observed asymmetry of the c1s line can not be directly related to the doping in graphene , and more systematic experiments will be needed to resolve this interesting issue .",

    "<S> spectra of the c1s core hole , created in xps and screened by electronic excitations in pristine and doped graphene , are calculated and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that singular effects in the lineshapes are not possible in the pristine graphene , and their observation should be connected with the doping . </S>",
    "<S> however , the structure of the low energy excitation spectrum in the region where the singular behaviour is expected leads to asymmetries in the core hole lineshapes in pristine graphene similar to those in doped graphene . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the analysis more complex than in the case of metals and may lead to incorrect or incomplete interpretation of experimental results . </S>"
