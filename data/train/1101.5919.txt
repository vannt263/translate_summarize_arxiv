    "we develop methods for the task of detecting statistical dependencies between multiple sources of co - occurring data .",
    "the sources are assumed to share relevant common information , and additionally contain independent but unknown type of noise .",
    "the task is to discover the relevant information ; both to detect and analyse or interpret it .",
    "this is a particular type of a data fusion task , shared by _ multi - view learning_. in multi - view learning each source is interpreted as a different view to the same items , and the task is to enhance classification performance by combining the views .",
    "our task can be interpreted as unsupervised multi - view learning .",
    "the traditional statistical way of finding dependencies between data sources is canonical correlation analysis , cca , which generalizes correlation to multidimensional sources , retaining some of the nice interpretability of correlation coefficients .",
    "while the basic correlation coefficient assumes paired scalar values , canonical correlations assume paired vectorial values .",
    "the vectors are projected to scalar components before computing the correlations , using linear projections that maximize the correlations . for multidimensional data",
    "there will be many correlation coefficients ; the second components are constrained to be uncorrelated with the first , and so on .",
    "cca is known to have two nice properties : the result is invariant to linear transformations of the data spaces , and the solution for any fixed number of components maximizes mutual information between linear projections for gaussian data .",
    "these insights can be interpreted as motivations for generalizing using nonparametric methods @xcite and kernel cca @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of cca can cause overfitting problems that are specifically harmful with small sample sizes that abound in biomedical studies , for instance .",
    "when the views are high - dimensional , the completely unconstrained linear projections involve high degrees of freedom ; several ways to regularize the cca solution have been suggested to overcome some of the associated problems @xcite .",
    "we introduce a complementary approach that is based on bringing in prior knowledge to constrain the model family .    assuming the dimensions of the different views are not completely unrelated but instead are formed of related pairs , it makes sense to search for more constrained projections . in our application ,",
    "the views are different measurements made on the same locations of the genome , and the dimensions correspond to these particular locations . constraining the projections to be",
    "the same or at least similar in the different views will additionally enhance interpretability of the results , given that relationships between the same components in the two views are natural .",
    "correlation - based cca has been shown to correspond to the maximum likelihood solution of a simple generative model @xcite , where the two views are assumed to stem from a shared gaussian latent variable and normally distributed data - set - specific noise .",
    "this has opened up the road to probabilistic and bayesian formulations @xcite which make it possible to deal rigorously with uncertainty in small sample sizes and to include prior knowledge as bayesian priors .",
    "we suggest also a probabilistic version for constrained dependency search that provides a robust alternative for direct maximization of correlations . while the probabilistic version is slower to compute , it is the recommended choice when prior information of the types of dependency is available , or sample size is small .",
    "the methods will be applied in a very promising application setup for knowledge discovery with dependency detection .",
    "the task is to find potential cancer genes by studying the relationship between changes caused by cancer in gene expression and gene copy numbers , that is , amplifications or deletions caused by mutations in cancer samples .",
    "copy number changes are a key mechanism for cancer , and combination of copy number information with gene expression measurements can reveal functional effects of the mutations ; gene expression data is informative of gene activity .",
    "the rationale goes as follows : mutations having no functional effect will not cause cancer , and cancer - related gene expression changes may be side effects .",
    "gene expression changes caused by mutations would be strong candidates for cancer mechanisms , and they contribute to the dependencies between the two data sources . while causation can be difficult to grasp , study of the dependencies can provide an efficient proxy for such effects .",
    "correlation - based cca searches for a maximally correlated linear projection of the original data sets with paired samples @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it maximizes the correlation between the projections , @xmath2 , with respect to arbitrary projection vectors @xmath3 .",
    "however , this flexibility easily leads to overfitting as demonstrated by the case study in section  [ sec : application ] .    in many applications prior information of the potential relationships between the features of the investigated data sets",
    "is available . constraining the projections accordingly",
    "can potentially reduce overfitting and help to focus on specific types of dependencies between the two data sets .",
    "a particular example of such a model is provided by our cancer gene discovery application , where gene copy number changes are systematically correlated with the gene expression measurements from the same genes .",
    "the relationship between the projections can be parametrized with a transformation matrix @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "maximization of the correlations between the projections leads to the following optimization problem : @xmath6 where the observed covariances of the two data sets are denoted by the @xmath7 .",
    "constraints on @xmath4 can be used to guide the dependency search .",
    "we refer to this model as similarity - constrained cca ( _ simcca _ ) .",
    "suitable constraints depend on the particular applications ; the solutions can be made to prefer particular types of dependencies in a soft manner with an appropriate penalty term on @xmath4 .    while we consider only one - dimensional projections in the case study , multidimensional projection matrices are also possible .",
    "the optimal projection vectors can be sought iteratively as in ordinary cca .",
    "direct optimization of the correlations provides a simple and computationally efficient way to detect dependencies between data sources but it lacks an explicit model to deal with the uncertainty in the data and model parameters .",
    "an explicit model - based approach for the dependency exploration task is provided by the probabilistic modeling framework .",
    "we derive a probabilistic approach which should be more robust to small sample sizes .",
    "the correlation - based cca has a direct connection to the maximum likelihood ( ml ) solution of the generative model @xcite : @xmath8 assuming normally distributed @xmath9 , and data - set - specific covariances @xmath10 .",
    "the dependency between the data sets is captured by the shared latent variable @xmath9 , and @xmath11 characterize the relationship between the data sets .",
    "the covariances @xmath10 characterize data set - specific effects .",
    "note that while optimal projections @xmath12 in the correlation - based cca ( eq .  [ eq : simcca ] ) operate on the observed data , the parameters of interest , @xmath11 , in probabilistic cca mediate transformations of the latent variable @xmath9 .",
    "the solutions of the probabilistic cca can be constrained analogously to the correlation - based approach in eq  ( [ eq : simcca ] ) , by extending the formulation to include appropriate prior terms .",
    "the joint likelihood of the model is given by    [ eq : probsimcca0 ] p ( x , & y , w , ) + ~ & p(x , y|w_x , w_y,)p(w_y|w_x)p(w_x)p ( ) + = & p(x , y|w_x , w_y , , ) & + & p(w_y|w_x)p(w_x)p()p ( ) d.    here @xmath13 denotes the block - diagonal matrix of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "while incorporation of prior information of the data set - specific effects through the @xmath16 and @xmath13 provides promising lines for further work , we focus on the shared latent variables as a probabilistic alternative to the correlation - based simcca .",
    "the relation between the transformation matrices for the shared latent variable is encoded by the prior term @xmath17 and can be parametrized with a transformation matrix @xmath4 such that @xmath18 .",
    "assuming invertible @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 .    by setting a prior on @xmath4",
    "it is possible to emphasize certain types of dependencies . with unconstrained @xmath4",
    "the solution reduces to ordinary probabilistic cca . in the other extreme",
    "@xmath4 is an identity matrix , @xmath21 , and the two shared components , derived from @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , would be identical .",
    "the formulation would also allow tuning of @xmath4 between these two extremes .",
    "we consider the following simple prior for @xmath4 : @xmath24 .",
    "this can be plugged into @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : probsimcca0 ] ) .",
    "we have used frobenius norm , and @xmath25 refers to truncated normal distribution for positive input values .",
    "the @xmath26 can tune the deviation of @xmath4 from the identity matrix ; a strict version of probabilistic simcca ( psimcca ) is obtained with @xmath27 , while @xmath28 yields ordinary probabilistic cca ( pcca ) . with uninformative priors @xmath29 and normally distributed shared latent variable @xmath30",
    ", the model has the negative log - likelihood @xmath31 here @xmath32 contains the matrices @xmath11 and data set specific covariances @xmath10 .",
    "we have added the prior for @xmath4 , which tunes the relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath16 . for other details , see @xcite .",
    "a promising biomedical application highlights the potential practical value of our approach .",
    "constraints on the potential dependencies between gene expression and copy number are shown to improve the detection of known cancer genes .",
    "the advantages of constrained and probabilistic versions become particularly salient when the dimensionality increases and ordinary correlation - based cca seriously overfits to the data .",
    "copy number changes in chromosomal regions with tumor - suppressor or other cancer - associated genes have important contribution to cancer development and progression .",
    "chromosomal gains and losses are likely to be positively correlated with the expression levels of the affected genes ; copy number gain is likely to increase the expression of some of the associated genes whereas deletion will block gene expression .",
    "identification of cancer - associated regions with functional copy number changes has potential diagnostic , prognostic and clinical impact for cancer studies .",
    "canonical correlations provide a principled framework for detecting the shared variation in gene expression and copy number data .",
    "systematic copy number changes in a particular chromosomal region are captured by multiple copy number probes , and this is also visible in the expression levels of the genes within the affected region .",
    "the dependent signals can be subtle , however , as gene expression and copy number data are affected by high levels of unrelated biological and measurement variation , and the sample sizes are typically small .",
    "both correlation - based and probabilistic simcca combine power over the adjacent genes by capturing the strongest shared signal in gene expression and copy number observations .",
    "they can also ignore unrelated signal from poorly performing probes , or probes that measure genes that are not functionally affected by the copy number change .",
    "this provides tools to distinguish between so - called driver mutations having functional effects from less active passenger mutations , which is an important task in cancer studies .",
    "a further advantage of the probabilistic formulation is that the shared latent variable @xmath9 provides a robust measure of the amplification effects in each patient .",
    "simcca is used to study the association between gene expression and copy number in a gastric cancer data set with 41 patients and 10 controls @xcite .",
    "the gene expression and copy number data sets were matched for the analysis such that the closest probe by genomic location in gene expression data was selected for each copy number probe , and probes with no match between gene expression and copy number within 5000 bp interval were discarded .",
    "the preprocessed data has gene expression and copy number measurements from 5596 genes from @xmath34 chromosomal regions ( cytobands ) . to satisfy the normality assumptions of our model , the data was @xmath35-transformed and the mean of the signals for each probe was set to 0 before the analysis .",
    "ordinary and constrained versions of canonical correlation analysis , cca / simcca , were applied to investigate the dependencies between gene expression and copy numbers .",
    "the correlations were computed within a specific chromosomal window around each gene .",
    "the observed correlations provide a measure of dependency between gene copy number and expression data for each window , or chromosomal region .    with unconstrained @xmath4 , the models defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : simcca ] ) and  ( [ eq : probsimcca ] ) reduce to ordinary correlation - based and probabilistic cca , respectively .",
    "we assume that the constraints for @xmath4 are provided prior to analysis , i.e. the prior parameter @xmath36 is fixed .",
    "alternatively , @xmath36 could be optimized based on external criteria such as identification of the known cancer genes in our application .",
    "our empirical results show , however , that already a simple prior for @xmath4 without an explicit optimization procedure can improve the detection of known cancer genes .",
    "we consider here the two extreme cases of the model where t is ( i ) completely unconstrained ( ordinary cca ; @xmath37 ) , and ( ii ) @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "point estimates for the model parameters were estimated with em algorithm in the probabilistic version .",
    "strength of the shared signal versus marginal effects is measured with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes matrix trace .",
    "this yields a dependency score between copy number and expression data for the investigated chromosomal neighborghood around each gene .",
    "high scores highlight regions where the dependent signal between the two data sets is particularly high relative to the data - set - specific variation .",
    "in addition to the correlation - based and probabilistic simcca , we tested a simplified probabilistic version with one - dimensional shared component @xmath9 and isotropic covariances for the data - set - specific effects : ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is a special case of the full probabilistic model , and it reduces to principal component analysis ( pca ) for concatenated data @xmath43 .",
    "we refer to this method as psimpca .",
    "the simplified model does not distinguish between the shared and marginal effects as effectively as the full probabilistic cca but it has fewer model parameters .",
    "low - dimensional latent models are also faster to compute , and interpretation of the results is potentially more straightforward .",
    "results from the correlation - based simcca are illustrated for chromosome arm 17q in fig .",
    "[ fig:17q ] , where simcca highlights a known cancer - associated region .",
    "the figure shows the dependency score for the correlation - based simcca with a sliding window of 15 genes genes along the chromosome arm .",
    "the correlation - based and probabilistic approaches were compared in various window sizes ( 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 35 genes ) . in each experiment ,",
    "the gene list ordered by the dependency measure was compared to an expert - curated list of 59 gastric - cancer associated genes in our investigated data set @xcite .",
    "the correlation - based and probabilistic models were compared with respect to their ability to detect the known cancer genes , measured with the auc value of the roc curve for each method .",
    "results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : auc ] . the best auc value ( 0.79 )",
    "was obtained with a chromosomal window of 15 genes for the correlation - based simcca that directly maximizes the correlations assuming identical projections ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : simcca ] ) ) .",
    "the corresponding roc curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : roc ] and presents the tradeoff between true and false positive findings along the ordered gene list . while a large proportion of the most significant findings are in fact known cancer genes , the remaining findings with no known associations to gastric cancer are promising candidates for further studies ; among the 100 genes with highest dependencies between gene expression and copy number in their chromosomal neighborghood , 30% of the corresponding regions had previously known association with gastric cancer , while the proportion in the whole data set is 5% .    the constrained dependency detection methods introduced in this paper outperformed the unconstrained models in most cases .",
    "the improved detection performance of the constrained models is likely explained by their ability to reduce overfitting .",
    "interestingly , the most constrained probabilistic model , psimpca , outperforms the other approaches in the highest - dimensional case .",
    "in contrast , the performance of correlation - based cca decreases steadily with increasing dimensionality ( window size ) as the number of samples ( patients ) remains fixed to 51 .    in our particular application , gene expression and copy number",
    "are expected to have strong linear correlations in cancer - associated chromosomal regions .",
    "correlation - based approach is therefore directly suited for the cancer gene detection task and it has also fewer parameters than the probabilistic versions .",
    "however , the performance of correlation - based simcca reduces with increasing dimensionality .",
    "a likely explanation is that the correlation - based version models also some of the data set - specific effects , which is emphasized in higher - dimensions .",
    "the probabilistic formulations provide an alternative way to bring in prior knowledge of the relationships in a principled framework .",
    "a potential advantage of the probabilistic approaches is that they have an explicit model for distinguishing the shared signal from data set - specific variation .",
    "the results obtained using the simcca algorithm are in general concordant with the output from signal - to - noise statistics and random permutation method that was applied previously to analyze the same data @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the current method is that it combines the signal across adjacent genes within a particular chromosomal region already in the modeling step .",
    "probabilistic simcca estimates the strongest shared signal between the data sets and ignores other variation using explicit modeling assumptions .",
    "probabilistic versions also provide a measure of the amplification effect for each patient which allows robust identification of small patient groups with profound amplification effects that would be missed in previous permutation - based tests due to low event frequency .    in concordance with the previous analyses , the chromosomal area showing the most significant correlation between the gene copy number and expression was 17q12-q21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:17q ] ) .",
    "there are a number of potential target genes in that region , including _",
    "erbb2 _ and _ ppp1r1b _ , which show clinical and biological relevance .",
    "erbb2 _ gene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor , which is a target of herceptin .",
    "this monoclonal antibody specifically inactivates the overexpressed _",
    "erbb2 _ protein and is used to treat metastatic breast cancer patients .",
    "the expression of _",
    "ppp1r1b _ has been shown to be associated with repression of programmed cell death and increase the survival of the cancer cells in upper gastrointestinal tract cancers @xcite .",
    "another genomic region with correlated gene copy number and expression changes is 10q26 , and _",
    "fgfr2 _ was identified as one of the putative target genes of that region .",
    "it was recently shown that in a set of gastric cancer cell lines , _ fgfr2 _",
    "amplification is driving the cell proliferation and promoting cancer cell survival .",
    "furthermore , inhibition of the _ fgfr2 _ protein by small molecules retained the growth arresting and apoptotically active phenotype @xcite .",
    "the detected 1q22 region harbors the _ muc1 _",
    "gene , whose expression was shown to be associated with the intestinal subtype of gastric cancer @xcite .",
    "the 20q is one of the most frequently amplified chromosomal regions in gastric cancer .",
    "however , despite of high frequency of the amplifications the target genes in that area remain to be described .",
    "our analysis pinpointed the strongest correlating loci to 20q13.12 and significantly narrow the list of putative target genes .",
    "some of the detected chromosomal regions did not have known association with gastric cancer ; we are currently investigating these results more closely .",
    "the current application shows promising performance in detecting functional copy number changes , but biomedical studies provide also a number of other potential applications .",
    "for example , an increasing number of paired data sets are available in the future for studying the relationships between methylation , single - nucleotide polymorphisms , mirnas , and other genomic features .",
    "we have introduced methods that regularize cca solutions by taking into account similarity constraints .",
    "the methods assume that the dependencies between the different views are visible in the same dimensions , that is , the projection matrices are similar .",
    "we introduced the constraints to standard cca , resulting in a quick method that helps in solving the `` small @xmath44 large @xmath45 problem '' , where @xmath44 is the number of samples and @xmath45 their dimensionality .",
    "if @xmath44 is very small compared to @xmath45 , even the constrained cca may not be sufficient , and we introduced a bayesian variant into which further prior knowledge can be easily inserted , and which is capable of rigorously handling uncertainty in the data . while we only compare simcca and cca in the present work , the probabilistic formulation allows smooth tradeoff between these two extremes , which is potentially useful in many applications .",
    "importantly , the constrained approaches for dependency detection can be directly applied in practical tasks in knowledge discovery ; good results were obtained in a promising medical application on searching for potential cancer genes by detecting dependencies between gene expression and dna copy number changes of the genes .",
