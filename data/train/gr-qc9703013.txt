    "the coalescence of double white dwarf and double neutron star binaries is important to examine since this process may produce a number of astrophysically interesting objects and events .",
    "double white dwarf binary mergers have been suggested as precursors to some type ia supernovae ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; iben 1988 , 1991 ; iben & webbink 1989 ; branch et al .",
    "1995 ) and to long gamma  ray bursts ( katz & canel 1996 ) .",
    "white dwarf  white dwarf mergers may also lead to the formation of massive single white dwarfs or neutron stars ( colgate & petschek 1982 ; saio & nomoto 1985 ; iben & tutukov 1986 ; kawai , saio , & nomoto 1987 ; chen & leonard 1993 ) ; to the formation of subdwarf stars ; or to the formation of hydrogen deficient , highly luminous stars ( iben 1990 and references therein ; webbink 1984 ) . neutron star ",

    "are also expected to be relatively strong sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "the gravitational radiation emitted during the inspiral phase of double neutron star binary evolution ( i.e. , before tidal effects become sizeable ) is likely to be detected by terrestrial interferometric detectors such as ligo and virgo , which will be sensitive to frequencies in the range of 10@xmath3 hz ( abramovici et al .",
    "1992 ; cutler et al .  1993",
    "; thorne 1995 ) .",
    "proposed `` dual  recycled '' interferometers and spherical `` tiga '' type resonant detectors will be more sensitive than ligo to the higher frequency radiation , @xmath4 hz , emitted during the brief final merger stage of the coalescence ( meers 1988 ; strain & meers 1991 ; cutler et al .  1993 ; merkowitz & johnson 1994 ; thorne 1995 ; however , see wilson & mathews 1995 who indicate that the gravitational wave radiation emitted during this phase may have a lower frequency than previously expected ) .",
    "the gravitational wave radiation emitted during the merger phase in double white dwarf binary evolution is unlikely to be detected in the near future because the expected frequency of the radiation falls in or just beyond the upper end of the frequency range ( @xmath5@xmath6 hz ) of proposed space  based laser interferometric detectors ( faller et al .",
    "1989 ; hough et al .",
    "1995 ) and the duration of the phase will be too short to produce a significant signal in this range of the detectors sensitivity .    because the final stages of binary coalescence are driven in part by sizeable nonlinear tidal effects , numerical hydrodynamic techniques must be used to properly follow the evolution of merging binaries .",
    "the first step in performing such a hydrodynamic simulation is the construction of an appropriate initial model .",
    "the coalescence of the chosen binary system must proceed on a dynamical timescale ( on the order of a few initial orbital periods ) , in order for an explicit hydrodynamics code to be able to carry out the simulation in a reasonable amount of computational time .",
    "hence , the components of the initial binary model must either be at a separation where they are dynamically unstable to coalescence or they must be forcibly brought to coalescence from a wide separation ( e.g. , by draining orbital angular momentum away from the system in a way that mimics the effects of the gravitational wave radiation reaction ) . using the former methodology ,",
    "the work presented herein focuses on the identification of dynamically unstable binary systems .",
    "the initial separation at which a particular binary model becomes dynamically unstable to merger , if one exists , can be found via a stability analysis of a set of binary models constructed in hydrostatic equilibrium , along a constant mass sequence of decreasing orbital separation .",
    "this sequence serves as an approximate representation of the evolution of the binary as its components are brought closer together by the effects of gravitational radiation .",
    "such analyses have recently been done by lai , rasio , & shapiro ( hereafter lrs ) and by rasio & shapiro ( hereafter rs ) for binaries with polytropic equations of state ( eos ) . in a polytropic equation of state , the pressure @xmath7 is expressed in terms of the density @xmath8 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the polytropic constant and @xmath11 is the polytropic index ( see  2 ) .",
    "the analytical work of lrs utilized an approximate energy variational method and studied detached binaries with components having various mass ratios , spins , and polytropic indices ( lrs 1993a , b , 1994a , b ) . the numerical work of rs utilized the smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique to study detached and contact binaries with components having various mass ratios , but equal spins and polytropic indices ( rs 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ; for earlier work see gingold & monaghan 1979 ; hachisu & eriguchi 1984a , b ; hachisu 1986b ) .",
    "we performed stability analyses of equilibrium sequences of double white dwarf binaries constructed with the zero  temperature white dwarf equation of state ( chandrasekhar 1967 ) , double neutron star binaries constructed with realistic neutron star equations of state ( adapted from cook , shapiro , & teukolsky 1994 ) , and , for the sake of comparison with the work of lrs and rs , polytropic binaries with @xmath2 , 1.0 , and 1.5 equations of state .",
    "the examined equilibrium sequences were constructed with the self  consistent field technique of hachisu ( 1986a , b ) , which produces models of rotating , self  gravitating fluid systems in hydrostatic equilibrium . for simplicity , all binary models along these sequences were constructed as synchronously rotating systems having equal  mass ( @xmath12 ) components .",
    "the relative stability of individual binary systems along selected sequences was examined using a three  dimensional ( 3d ) , finite  difference hydrodynamics code .",
    "both the construction of our equilibrium binary sequences and our stability tests along these sequences have been done using purely newtonian gravity and newtonian dynamics .",
    "our numerical techniques are briefly described in section 2 . constructed equilibrium sequences are presented in section 3 and our dynamical tests of the stability of individual models along selected sequences are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , the implications of these results are discussed in section 5 .",
    "our simulations of close binary systems involve the solution of the following set of equations which govern the structure and evolution of a nonrelativistic fluid in cylindrical coordinates :    the continuity equation , @xmath13 the three components of the equation of motion , @xmath14 poisson s equation @xmath15 and the equation of state ( see below ) . in the above equations , @xmath16 is the velocity ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the radial , vertical , and angular momentum densities , respectively ( where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the radial , vertical , and azimuthal components of the velocity , respectively ) ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the cylindrical coordinates ; and @xmath26 is the gravitational potential .",
    "we have used three types of barotropic equations of state in this work .",
    "the first , and simplest , type is a polytropic equation of state for which @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the polytropic constant and @xmath11 , the polytropic index , determines the degree of compressibility of the fluid ( the higher the value of @xmath11 , the more compressible / softer the fluid ) .",
    "the second type of equation of state used is the zero  temperature white dwarf ( wd ) equation of state ( chandrasekhar 1967 ) , which represents the pressure distribution of a completely degenerate electron gas : @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\ x & \\equiv & \\left ( \\rho /b_{0}\\right)^{1/3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the mean molecular weight per electron .",
    "we have used @xmath32 in all of our computations . the heaviest nonrotating single object that can be constructed with this equation of state has a mass of @xmath33 ( this is the chandrasekhar mass @xmath34 ) .    the third type of equation of state used here is a realistic neutron star ( ns ) equation of state .",
    "we have chosen three such equations of state ( from among the fourteen realistic ns equations of state listed in cook , shapiro , & teukolsky [ 1994 , hereafter cst ] ) , each with a different degree of compressibility ( one soft , one medium , and one hard ) .",
    "specifically , the chosen soft equation of state is cst s equation of state f ; the medium one is cst s equation of state fps ; and the hard one is cst s equation of state l ( see references within cst for the original sources of these equations of state ) .",
    "we obtained these equations of state in tabular form from cook ( 1995 ) .",
    "the tables each provide @xmath35 values of the pressure @xmath7 for values of @xmath8 ranging over 15 orders of magnitude , from to @xmath36 ( note that it is actually the number density @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , that is tabulated ) . because we wanted to perform _ parallel _ finite  difference hydrodynamics ( fdh ) simulations of systems with these equations of state and",
    "did not possess an interpolation algorithm designed for efficient use on a parallel machine , polynomial fits to the tabular data were necessary .",
    "some numerical manipulation of the data was also needed because of the particulars of the technique used in the initial model construction .",
    "( see new [ 1996 ] for details . )",
    "if the only motion of a fluid system is rotation about an axis with an angular velocity @xmath39 , which is constant in time and a function only of the distance from the rotation axis , the structure of the system is described by the following single expression : @xmath40 where the z  axis has been chosen as the axis of rotation and the centrifugal potential @xmath41 .",
    "such a fluid is said to be in hydrostatic equilibrium because the forces due to its pressure and to its gravitational and centrifugal potentials are in balance .",
    "all of the initial equilibrium binary systems studied in this work have been constructed in hydrostatic equilibrium according to this prescription , along with the additional constraint that angular velocity is a spatial constant @xmath42 ( i.e. , not a function of @xmath23 ) . in this case of uniform rotation , @xmath43 .",
    "the method we have used to construct the equilibrium models is hachisu s grid ",
    "based 3d , self  consistent field ( hscf ) technique ( hachisu 1986a , b ) .",
    "this iterative technique produces rotating , self  gravitating fluid systems in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "our version of the hscf 3d code computes the gravitational potential via a direct numerical solution of poisson s equation ( 5 ) .",
    "details of the method used can be found in tohline ( 1978 ) .",
    "an estimate of the quality of the converged equilibrium configuration is obtained from a determination of how well the energy is balanced in the system .",
    "this balance is measured by the _ virial error _",
    "@xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the kinetic energy ; @xmath47 is the gravitational potential energy ; and @xmath48 is the volume of the model . the virial errors in our equilibrium models constructed with polytropic and wd eos were typically @xmath49@xmath5 ; those in models constructed with the realistic ns eos were typically @xmath50 .",
    "the forms of the wd and realistic ns equations of state are such that when they are used in the hscf code , the density maxima @xmath51 of the models to be constructed must be given to the code as input .",
    "thus because we were interested in constant mass sequences for our stability analyses of close binaries , we had to perform an iteration in the choice of @xmath51 until we arrived at a configuration with the desired @xmath52 , in the case of models with the wd and realistic ns equations of state . however , in the polytropic case , converged models can actually be obtained without an _ a priori _ choice of @xmath51 and then later scaled as desired .",
    "our 3d equilibrium configurations are assumed to be symmetric about the @xmath53 ( equatorial ) plane ; this symmetry will be referred to as equatorial symmetry . because our version of the 3d hscf code constructs binaries with only equal ",
    "mass components , a periodic symmetry over the azimuthal range @xmath54 is also assumed .",
    "this means that a quantity @xmath55 specified at an angle @xmath24 is equivalent to that same quantity specified at all angles @xmath56 for which @xmath57 and @xmath58 is an integer : @xmath59 this symmetry will be referred to as @xmath60symmetry .",
    "a finite  difference hydrodynamics ( fdh ) code was used to solve , on a discrete numerical grid , equations ( 1 - 5 ) and an equation of state ( see above ) , which govern the temporal evolution of a fluid .",
    "fdh codes differ from smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes in that they follow the evolution of the fluid as it flows through a fixed set of grid cells , instead of treating the fluid as a set of particles and following the evolution of each particle .",
    "the 3d fdh code used in this present study is a fortran 90 version of the fortran 77 code described by woodward ( 1992 ) and woodward , tohline , & hachisu ( 1994 ) .",
    "it was written , principally by woodward , to take advantage of the parallel architecture of the maspar computers on which it is run .",
    "the accuracy of the code is second order in both time and space .",
    "the numerical techniques employed are discussed in detail in woodward ( 1992 ) . the solution to poisson s equation ( 5 )",
    "is obtained through the adi method ( cohl et al .",
    "1997 ) .    as in the hscf code",
    ", the grid cells are uniformly spaced in each of the three directions and equatorial and @xmath60symmetries are assumed .",
    "the single precision hydrodynamic simulations presented here were performed on cylindrical grids with resolutions of @xmath61 .    in the binary stability analysis simulations presented in  4 , from @xmath62 to 16,700 timesteps",
    "were required to follow each binary through one initial orbital period @xmath63 . on the 8k  node maspar mp1 at lsu , each timestep took @xmath64 cpu seconds ( or @xmath65 per grid zone ) ; hence , these simulations required @xmath66 to 88 cpu hours per @xmath63 .",
    "this large range is due to the variation in the size of the integration timestep that could be taken in the different simulations .",
    "the size of this timestep is restricted in order to ensure the numerical stability of the computations .",
    "the simulations we performed varied in length from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "a few of our binary dynamical stability test simulations were run on the 4k  node maspar mp2 at the scalable computing laboratory of the doe ames laboratory at iowa state university .",
    "the cpu time per timestep required for simulations conducted on the mp2 is about @xmath69 that of the time required to run on the mp1 at lsu .",
    "our fdh code typically follows the fluid evolution in the inertial reference frame .",
    "however , we chose to incorporate the option of running the code in a frame of reference which rotates with the initial angular velocity of the fluid , @xmath70 .",
    "this choice was motivated by a desire to minimize numerical effects which might artificially influence the stability of the binary systems studied .",
    "the particular effect we sought to minimize was dissipation due to numerical viscosity , which arises from the coarseness of the finite differencing .",
    "the hope was that diminishing the motion of the fluid through the grid by running in the rotating reference frame would also diminish the dissipative effects of numerical viscosity on the fluid ( see  4 for further details ) .",
    "( we also tried updating the angular velocity of the rotating frame of reference once during some of the simulations presented here , in order to further minimize the dissipation due to numerical viscosity ) .",
    "the rotating reference frame adds two terms to the radial equation of motion ( 2 ) and one to the azimuthal equation ( 4 ) ( cf . , norman & wilson 1978 ) : @xmath71 the @xmath72 term that has been added to the radial equation of motion results from the centrifugal force ; the other two added terms result from the coriolis force .",
    "note that the centrifugal term in equation ( 11 ) can be rewritten as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "we use this form in the actual computation of the centrifugal term , with @xmath75 centered at the same place in each grid cell as is @xmath76 , in order to be numerically consistent with the computation of the curvature term @xmath77 in the radial equation of motion .    a discussion of the boundary conditions , vacuum treatment , and rotation axis treatment implemented in our hydrodynamics code is presented in new ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have constructed hydrostatic equilibrium sequences of synchronized close binaries with polytropic as well as realistic white dwarf and neutron star equations of state .",
    "the individual binary models along each sequence have the same equation of state and constant total mass @xmath78 , but decreasing binary separation @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath79 is the distance measured between the pressure [ density ] maxima of the stellar components .",
    "each such sequence represents a quasistatic approximation to the evolution of a binary system in which gravitational radiation gradually carries away the system s orbital angular momentum .",
    "these binary models were constructed , on @xmath80 grids , with the hscf technique ( see  2.1 ) , which creates models of rotating , self  gravitating fluid systems in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "it should be noted that the true physical viscosity present in double neutron star binaries is not expected to be strong enough to enforce synchronization ( bildsten & cutler 1992 ; kochanek 1992 ) and the viscosity of the degenerate material in double white dwarf binaries probably is not strong enough to synchronize them either ( this can be shown by applying the arguments given in bildsten & cutler 1992 to white dwarfs and using the values for the viscosity of degenerate material given in durisen 1973 ) .",
    "however , if magnetic fields are present , they may bring about synchronization .",
    "in any case , synchronization is at least a simplifying assumption .",
    "furthermore , since neutron stars have relatively strong gravitational fields , newtonian models and simulations of double neutron star binaries need to be viewed with caution .      the equilibrium sequences that we constructed for binary models with polytropic indices @xmath2 , 1.0 , and 1.5 are displayed in figure 1 . for each @xmath11 , the total energy @xmath81 and total angular momentum @xmath82 are plotted versus the separation @xmath79 .",
    "note that we do not claim that the results given in this figure or in the rest of the manuscript are necessarily accurate to the number of digits in which they are reported ; the number of digits in which the results are presented allows the display of characteristics of the equilibrium sequences and the differentiation between individual models on these sequences .",
    "as mentioned in  2.1 , the equations of state of the polytropic models are such that the total mass of the system @xmath52 does not have to be chosen before its construction , but can be scaled afterwards as desired .",
    "there are in fact three parameters , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and the polytropic constant @xmath10 , which set the scale of a polytropic model . here",
    "@xmath84 is the radius of a spherical star of mass @xmath85 and polytropic index @xmath11 .",
    "these parameters are related according to the following equation ( chandrasekhar 1967 ) : @xmath86^{\\frac{-(3+n)}{2(1-n ) } } \\left[\\frac{r_{sph}}{r_n}\\right]^{\\frac{(3-n)}{(1-n)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are lane ",
    "emden constants for a particular value of @xmath11 ( see table 1 for their values corresponding to @xmath2 , 1.0 , and 1.5 ) .",
    "thus , only two of these three parameters are independent ; if two of them are specified , the other one is automatically determined .",
    "the quantities in figure 1 are themselves normalized to @xmath89 , @xmath85 , and @xmath84 .",
    "specifically , @xmath81 has been divided by @xmath90 ; @xmath82 has been divided by @xmath91 ; and @xmath79 has been divided by @xmath84 .    in the discussion that follows , as in figure 1 ,",
    "all values of the binary separation @xmath79 have been normalized to @xmath84 . on each sequence",
    ", point c marks the system where the surfaces of the two binary components just come into contact .",
    "systems to the right of this point are detached binaries and systems to left are contact binaries or `` dumbbells . '' for the sake of illustration , figure 2 displays an isodensity surface image of an example detached binary model ( @xmath92 , @xmath0 ) and of an example dumbbell model ( @xmath93 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "points m mark the models along each sequence which have the minimum total energy and the minimum total angular momentum . along all three polytropic sequences ,",
    "the minimum in @xmath81 occurs at the same separation as the minimum in @xmath82 .",
    "( see  3.4 below for a discussion of the significance of these minima . )",
    "the model with the smallest separation on each sequence , marked with a t , will be referred to as the `` terminal '' model .",
    "no synchronously rotating binary models with the equation of state particular to that sequence can be constructed in equilibrium with a smaller separation than that of the terminal model because the centrifugal force would exceed the gravitational force along the equator of such systems .",
    "the separation at which this termination of the sequence occurs increases from @xmath94 for @xmath95 to @xmath96 for @xmath2 .",
    "the separation at which the minima occur also increases from @xmath93 for @xmath95 , to @xmath97 for @xmath0 , to @xmath98 for @xmath2 .",
    "note that contact occurs to the right of the minima for @xmath95 and to the left of the minima for @xmath0 and 0.5 .",
    "we have determined that points c and m coincide for @xmath99 .",
    "if the binary components were spherical , their separation at the point of contact would be @xmath100 .",
    "however , @xmath101 ranges from 2.81 for @xmath95 to 2.94 for @xmath2 .      in this section",
    ", we compare our polytropic equilibrium sequences to those of lrs ( 1993b ) and rs ( 1992 , 1995 ) .",
    "note that lrs ( 1993b ) and rs ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) define binary separation as the distance between the centers of mass of the binary components and , as mentioned above , we define it as the distance between the pressure ( density ) maxima of the components . for ease of comparison , the values of binary separation presented in this section that are based on our work do represent the separation between the centers of mass of our binary components . in this section and the rest of this manuscript ,",
    "any binary separation which refers to the distance between the components centers of mass will be denoted as @xmath102 .",
    "the analytical stability analyses of lrs ( 1993b ) , which utilized an approximate energy variational technique , also showed that simultaneous minima in @xmath81 and @xmath82 existed along sequences of constant mass , synchronized binaries with @xmath2 , 1.0 and 1.5 .",

    "hachisu ( 1986b ) also shows equilibrium sequences of @xmath2 and 1.5 polytropes .",
    "however he presents his results as sequences of @xmath110 versus @xmath111 instead of @xmath81 or @xmath82 versus @xmath79 .",
    "a comparison between hachisu s ( 1986b ) results and ours is given in figure 3 .",
    "to conform with hachisu s notation , the quantities in this figure are normalized to @xmath112 , @xmath52 , and @xmath113 , where @xmath113 is the total volume of the binary system .",

    "instead we have constructed separate wd sequences , each of which represents models with one specific value of @xmath52 .",
    "we have constructed nine such sequences with @xmath52 ranging from .298 @xmath117 to 2.72 @xmath117 .",

    "the angular momentum in this figure is normalized to @xmath132 in cgs units and the mass is normalized to @xmath117 .",
    "the comparison is excellent for low masses , however the relations deviate slightly for @xmath133 .      we have constructed equilibrium sequences for binary models with three realistic ns equations of state of varying compressibility ( f , soft ; fps , medium ; l , hard ) . as in the case of the wd equation of state , the desired @xmath52 for each of these sequences must be specified prior to their construction .",

    "the @xmath82 minima are well defined and occur at nearly the same separation on all three sequences ( on the f sequence at @xmath140 , on the fps sequence at @xmath141 , and on the l sequence at @xmath142 ) .",
    "like the white dwarf sequences , the minima always occur at a smaller separation than the points of contact",
    ". however , on all of the neutron star sequences these two points are very close together .",
    "the separation between points c and m thus seems to be determined by the lower density regions of the objects since this is where the equations of state , which differ significantly only in the density regimes above nuclear density ( @xmath143 ) , are similar .",
    "the scatter in @xmath81 displayed near the minima of these sequences may result in part from our piecemeal reconstruction of cook s ( 1995 ) tabular ns equations of state ( see  2 ) and from the approximate manner in which we calculate the internal energy @xmath144 of the models ( we compute an effective polytropic index @xmath145 for each grid zone in the model and then use these spatially varying indices to calculate the internal energy according to @xmath146 ) .",
    "because of these factors , we identify the @xmath82 minima as the true minima along these sequences and , as before , have marked their location with the letter m. another factor which must be kept in mind when studying the features of these ns sequences is that the virial error ( @xmath44 ) , which measures the quality of the equilibria , is @xmath50 .",
    "this is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the @xmath44 of models along the polytropic and wd equation of state sequences and almost certainly results in part from the piecemeal forms of the ns equations of state used .",
    "note that for the polytropic and wd equation of state , we typically very accurately pinpointed the location of the miminum by moving point b ( one of the two points on the surface of the star that must be given as input to the hscf code and whose position influences the separation of the binary components ) one grid cell at a time in the region of the minimum in order to get as many models as possible with the grid resolution we used .",
    "however , since we had difficulty obtaining converged models for some portions of the ns sequences , we moved point b two grid cells at a time when constructing ns models .",
    "thus the locations of the minima are slightly more uncertain for the ns equations of state than in the other studied equations of state .      turning points on equilibrium sequences , like the minima present in @xmath81 and @xmath82 along the sequences presented above ,",
    "are usually associated with points of instability .",
    "the two types of instability which will be discussed below are _ secular _ instability and _ dynamical _ instability . for an instability",
    "to be classified as dynamical , according to the convention of lrs ( 1993b ) , it must conserve energy , angular momentum , and circulation .",
    "if an instability proceeds as a result of some mechanism that dissipates one of the conserved quantities , e.g. , via viscosity or gravitational radiation , then it is classified as a secular instability ( see also tassoul [ 1978 ] for discussions of dynamical versus secular instabilities ) .",
    "a dynamical instability takes place on the dynamical timescale of the system ; a secular instability takes place on the timescale of the particular dissipative mechanism which induces it .",
    "the minima in @xmath81 and @xmath82 on synchronous binary sequences have been identified as points of secular instability by previous authors .",
    "lrs ( 1993b ) stated that the neighboring models adjacent to the model at the minimum of each sequence are uniformly rotating and therefore can only be reached with the aid of viscosity .",
    "thus they concluded that this minimum can not be associated with a dynamical instability since viscosity does not preserve circulation .",
    "their approximate analytical method predicts that on polytropic sequences with @xmath147 , dynamical instabilities exist at separations smaller than those of the minima . for the @xmath2 sequence ,",
    "these authors conclude that the dynamical instability sets in at @xmath148 .",
    "hachisu ( 1986b and references therein ) also labels turning points along his synchronous polytropic and wd sequences as points of secular instability .    because our hydrodynamics code does not include the dissipative effects of either the gravitational radiation reaction or the true fluid viscosity , we are unable to confirm the presence of a secular instability with a hydrodynamics simulation .",
    "however , it is possible to study the dynamical stability of a system with our code . in the following section",
    ", we present the results of our fdh tests of the dynamical stability of models on sequences selected from those presented above and compare these results with those of other authors .",

    "the two other models exhibit behavior in between these two extremes . note that after an initial dip , the moment of inertia of the model at the minimum of the sequence ( @xmath171 , the dot  dashed curve ) is nearly constant .",

    "as figure 13 illustrates , we have tested the dynamical stability of five binaries on the @xmath2 sequence with separations ranging from @xmath174 ( long dashed curve ) to @xmath175 ( solid curve ; terminal model ) .",
    "both the model at the minimum of the sequence ( @xmath176short dashed curve ) and the terminal model were unstable to merger on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the other three more widely separated models , including the model ( @xmath177dot  dashed curve ) located just prior to the minimum of the sequence , were stable .",
    "thus dynamical instability sets in at the minimum of this sequence ( @xmath176 , @xmath178 ) .",
    "the sph simulations of rs ( 1994 ) identified a point of dynamical instability along this sequence at @xmath179 .",
    "as figure 14 illustrates , we have tested the dynamical stability of a ns binary system near the minimum ( @xmath142 ) and a more widely separated model ( @xmath180 ) on the realistic neutron star equation of state l sequence .",
    "the model near the minimum of the sequence became unstable to dynamical merger in one @xmath63 .",
    "the more widely separated model appears to be stable ; its behavior resembles that of the most widely separated models tested on the @xmath0 and 0.5 sequences ( see figures 12 and 13 ) . although we have not accurately identified the separation at which the dynamical instability sets in along this sequence , it has obviously already done so at @xmath142 . by analogy with the @xmath2 sequence ,",
    "it is possible to infer that the onset of dynamical instability is associated with the region of the minimum energy and angular momentum along the sequence .",
    "as figure 15 illustrates , we have tested the dynamical stability of the model at the minimum ( @xmath140 ) of the realistic neutron star equation of state f sequence . like the model near the minimum of the equation of state l sequence ,",
    "the model at the minimum of this sequence is also unstable to dynamical merger .",
    "although we have not tested the stability of a widely separated model on this sequence , we infer , by analogy with the @xmath2 and equation of state l sequences , that there exist more widely separated models on this sequence that are stable and that the point of onset of the dynamical instability may be associated with the region of the minimum .",
    "we have not tested the stability of any of the models on the realistic ns equation of state fps sequence . however , since our tests of the stiff equation of state l and the soft equation of state f produced similar results , we expect that the stability properties of the models on this equation of state of medium stiffness will resemble the properties of models on these other realistic ns equations of state sequences .",
    "we have examined the dynamical stability of synchronously rotating , equal  mass binaries with polytropic , zero  temperature white dwarf , and realistic neutron star equations of state . specifically , we tested the dynamical stability of individual models constructed along equilibrium sequences of binaries with the same total mass @xmath52 and equation of state but decreasing separation , in order to determine if any models on these sequences were unstable to merger on a dynamical timescale .",
    "our stability analyses started with two white dwarf ( wd ) equation of state sequences , one with a low total mass ( @xmath129 ) and one with a fairly high total mass ( @xmath149 ) , used as representatives of the nine regular wd equation of state sequences we constructed ( which ranged in mass from @xmath181 to @xmath182 ) .",
    "our simulations indicate that no points of dynamical instability exist on either of these two sequences .",
    "we have inferred from this result , that it is likely ( although not certain ) that the other wd sequences are also dynamically stable .",
    "this being the case , we expect that wd mergers will only happen via secular processes and that it will not be possible to properly simulate the coalescence of equal  mass double white dwarf binaries using explicit fdh ( or sph ) techniques .",
    "it still remains to be seen whether or not double white dwarf binaries having unequal mass components are susceptible to merger on a dynamical timescale .",
    "our examination of the @xmath95 and @xmath0 polytropic sequences also identified no points of dynamical instability .",
    "this result conflicts with the published results of rs ( 1992 , 1995 ) who identified a dynamically unstable binary between the minimum and the terminal point of the @xmath95 sequence and another just past the minimum of the @xmath0 sequence .",
    "however , like rs ( 1994 ) , our test of the @xmath2 sequence does indicate the presence of a dynamical instability . in our simulations",
    ", this instability sets in at the minimum of the sequence .",
    "rs ( 1994 ) locate the point of dynamical instability at @xmath179 .",
    "although they do not state where the minimum of their sequence is located , the analytical work of lrs ( 1993b ) places it at @xmath103 .",
    "recall that lrs ( 1993b ) label this minimum as a secular instability and they predict that a dynamical instability sets in at a smaller separation ( @xmath148 ) on this sequence",
    ". however , in light of the simulations of rs ( 1994 ) and of this work , it seems likely that the minimum itself may be associated with the onset of the dynamical instability .    the differences between our results and those of rs ( 1992 , 1995 ) for the sequences with the softer equations of state may result from the fact that sph has difficulty modeling low density regions that are more extensive in systems with softer equations of state .",
    "it is interesting to note that the analytical work of lrs ( 1993b ) predicts that points of dynamical instability exist only on sequences for which @xmath11 is less than @xmath183 . it would be intriguing to test the stability of other polytropic sequences with our fdh code in order to determine at what value of @xmath11 the dynamical instability first appears .",
    "another point that is worth emphasizing again , is that our stability tests were run in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "we believe that we would have misidentified some truly stable models as being unstable had these tests been performed in the inertial frame ( see the discussion in  4 associated with figure 8) .",
    "our stability analyses of the realistic neutron star ( ns ) equations of state sequences identified models at ( or near ) the minima of the soft equation of state f and the hard equation of state l as being dynamically unstable . however , because of computing resource constraints we have been unable to determine whether or not the _ onset _ of the dynamical instability takes place in the regions of the minima of these sequences .",
    "if the @xmath2 sequence is taken as an example , one might infer this to be the case .",
    "although we did not test the stability of the medium equation of state fps sequence we constructed , we expect that such tests would yield results similiar to those of the other two ns equations of state .",
    "if further simulations of the @xmath2 and ns equations of state sequences do identify the minimum as the point of dynamical instability , the question will arise as to why this turning point does not also mark the onset of dynamical instability on the sequences with softer equations of state . at this time we are unable to provide a physical explanation for this possibility ( see , however , the discussion in lrs [ 1993b ] ) .",
    "all of the binary models that we have identified as stable against dynamical merger in  4 have not necessarily become steady  state configurations by the end of our simulations .",
    "in fact , at the end of our simulations the moments of inertia of some of the stable models are still decreasing gradually and those of others are still increasing gradually .",
    "however , these binaries did not become unstable to merger on a dynamical timescale ( i.e. , @xmath184 a few @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this gradual ( secular  type ) evolution of our models is such that models before the minimum of a sequence ( i.e. , models with separations larger than that of the model at the minimum ) tended to exhibit decreasing moments of inertia and those after the minimum tended to exhibit increasing moments of inertia .",
    "( this trend appears in the simulations of models on the low mass white dwarf sequence and is more pronounced in the tests of models with stiffer equations of state . )",
    "lrs ( 1994b ) have indicated that viscosity does indeed cause the orbits of models before the minimum of a sequence to decay .",
    "they also suggest that as a result of the action of viscosity , the orbit of a binary past the minimum ``  can either expand  as the system is driven to a lower energy , stable synchronized state , or it can decay  as the stars are driven to coalescence . ''",
    "the lrs ( 1994b ) description of the action of viscosity is consistent with our results if the gradual evolution of the moments of inertia of our models is attributed to the effects of the remaining numerical viscosity in our code ( which acted in our case to _ increase _ the moments of inertia of dynamically stable models past the minima ) . by carrying out simulations in the rotating reference frame (",
    "as is illustrated in figure 8) , we have overcome the primary effect of numerical viscosity , which is to dissipate orbital motions and drive systems to coalescence . in simulations performed in the rotating frame",
    ", it may be a higher order effect of numerical viscosity on any internal motions that develop in the systems that causes the observed secular  type evolution of our binary models .",
    "note that this higher order effect of numerical viscosity can not be identified as the mechanism responsible for driving any of our unstable models to coalescence because the timescale of their evolution was dynamical and not gradual .",
    "in addition , had this aspect of numerical viscosity played a significant role in the evolution of the terminal model on the @xmath2 sequence , its moment of inertia should have increased gradually , but instead its moment of inertia decreased and the model merged on a dynamical timescale .    even though our work indicates that there is no point of dynamical instability along the @xmath0 sequences , it would still be possible for an explicit hydrodynamics code to follow the merger of a close binary with this equation of state if it was assumed to represent a neutron star  neutron star system .",
    "this is because the timescale , @xmath185 , on which gravitational radiation would drive a close neutron star  neutron star binary to coalescence is on the order of its initial orbital period , @xmath63 .",
    "according to shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) , a point mass approximation to this timescale is @xmath186 if the binary at the minimum of our @xmath0 sequence is assumed to have components with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , then @xmath189 .",
    "( note that for the binary at the minimum of our @xmath149 wd equation of state sequence , @xmath190 and for the binary with @xmath151 on our @xmath129 wd equation of state sequence , @xmath191 . ) hence , if the effects of the gravitational radiation reaction were accounted for , as other authors have done ( e.g. , oohara & nakamura 1990 ; davies et al .",
    "1994 ; zhuge , centrella , & mcmillan 1994 ; ruffert , janka , & schfer 1996 ) , the merger of the @xmath0 binary would proceed on a timescale comparable to the dynamical timescale .    the variation between the results of our stability analyses of binaries with the softer equations of state and those of rs ( 1992 , 1995 ) emphasizes the importance of comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations performed with different numerical techniques .",
    "certainly the inclusion of more complex physics , such as the effects of the gravitational radiation reaction and of full general relativity should be the aim of research in this field .",
    "however , an effort should be made to reach agreement on the results of much simpler , newtonian simulations in order that their results and the results of more complex simulations can be confidently presented as guides to those who will be designing and building gravitational radiation detectors and interpreting the data collected at future gravitational radiation observatories .",
